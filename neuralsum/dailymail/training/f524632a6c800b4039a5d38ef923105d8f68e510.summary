desperate : @entity0 , who can only speak to his family via @entity2 from @entity3 for a few agonising moments , the @entity5 screen was blank			1
then , at last , it flickered to life , to be filled by a familiar round face with a white - flecked beard and deeply - etched lines			0
though the man forced one of his big , trademark smiles , fear and misery were seared in his eyes ; though he tried to sound optimistic			0
gathered around the screen , his family bolstered his spirits with uplifting stories about their lives – how his children were faring well at school and growing up to make him proud ; yet they , too , struggled to mask their sorrow			2
relayed 4,600 miles from @entity3 , @entity26 , to @entity27 , @entity28 via @entity2 , this was @entity30 ’s first call to his wife , @entity32 , and four children ( aged between 17 and 13 ) , for two and a half years			1
since 2012 , the @entity35 authorities had forbidden the last @entity37 resident being held in the detention camp from communicating with his family , and his only contact with the world beyond his grim cell had come via occasional meetings with lawyers			1
perplexingly , however , mr @entity0 – who has been held without trial for 13 years since being captured in @entity45 and handed to @entity35 forces fighting the @entity47 – has been permitted to make two @entity2 calls to them in the past month			1
the most recent lasted an hour and came last thursday : the day the @entity50 began campaigning for his release on the grounds that to imprison anyone – even if they turn out to be a very bad man – indefinitely without testing their guilt or innocence before a court of law violates the most fundamental principle of western justice			0
the emotion - charged call , facilitated by the @entity63 ( who provided the @entity5 ) , was described yesterday by mr @entity0 ’s father - in - law , @entity65 , 72 , who remained in the room for the first 15 minutes , before withdrawing so that his daughter and grandchildren could speak to him privately			1
‘ we did n’t know then that the @entity50 had decided to fight his cause , so we had to be truthful and tell him that no one was writing about his case			0
he looked very disappointed but when we are able to tell him about your campaign the next time we speak , it will give him new heart			0
father of four : mr @entity0 , pictured with two of his children , has been permitted to make two @entity2 calls to them in the past month ‘ we have no idea why they are allowing @entity0 to call us now , after such a long and very painful silence			1
it might be a sign that something is about to happen , but we have been disappointed so many times that we dare n’t raise our hopes			0
’ mr @entity65 recalls that his son - in - law has been held in @entity3 since 2002			1
his family expected him to be released in february 2009 – coming home on the same @entity28 - bound plane as @entity100 , another @entity37 resident who had been detained in the @entity35 camp			1
the family decked the house with balloons and ‘ @entity106 ’ bunting			0
but it had to be taken down when @entity0 was not released			2
mr @entity65 suspects that the reason , despite having been cleared for release by the @entity35 , was because it was feared he would reveal bombshell secrets about his years in detention that would be highly damaging to the @entity113 government			1
stressing that he thinks it is a party political issue , he says : ‘ the @entity115 and @entity116 seem genuinely interested in bringing him home , but @entity113 did absolutely nothing – just promises and going to pointless meetings			0
family : mr @entity0 ’s father - in - law , @entity65 , 72 , said the detainee had wanted to know ' whether anyone outside our family cared about him ' ‘ i think they wanted to leave him there because @entity127 had warned them what would happen if he came back			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s @entity28 lawyer , @entity130 , concurs			2
in fact , she goes further , suggesting that the reason the @entity35 have n’t released him – despite freeing 18 other detainees in recent weeks – might be because they are relying on flawed ‘ intelligence ’ , provided many years ago by the @entity37 security services , warning them that it would n’t be safe to send him back to @entity37			1
whatever the truth , his family say he would welcome the opportunity to stand trial in a @entity37 court , or indeed any court , to prove his innocence			1
for their part , the @entity35 authorities contend that he left @entity28 for @entity145 shortly before the 9/11 attacks to join @entity147 and that he served as @entity149 ’s personal interpreter			2
however , mr @entity0 denies this			2
he maintains – suspicious as it undeniably sounds – that he went to live in @entity45 to experience life in an @entity154 country and to do charity work , having been presented with obstacles when he applied to move his family to his native @entity157 , to be near his parents			1
when the @entity159 broke out , he says , he attempted to return to @entity37 but was captured by the keepers of a guesthouse where he was lodging and sold to the @entity162 , who , in turn , sold him to the @entity35 for a $ 5,000 bounty			1
‘ why would he have applied to live in @entity157 , if he had wanted to fight with the @entity47 or @entity147 ? ’ asks his father - in - law @entity65 incredulously , as the country ’s government broke links with the terror organisations many years ago			1
‘ he approached the @entity157 embassy in @entity28 and had two or three meetings with them			0
‘ he would welcome the chance to tell all this to a @entity37 court			0
if there ’s anything against him , let them put him before a judge and jury			0
’ mr @entity65 added that – as the family patriarch – he would personally vouch for his son - in - law ’s good behaviour , were he to be returned to @entity37			1
what ’s more , he is convinced that his son - in - law would not – if released or cleared – follow the example of several of the other @entity37 former detainees who obtained huge compensation after suing the government			2
cause : mr @entity0 maintains – suspicious as it undeniably sounds – that he went to live in @entity45 to experience life in an @entity154 country and to do charity work the day before last thursday ’s @entity2 call , mr @entity0 met his human rights lawyer , @entity196 , at @entity3			1
until @entity197 declassifies records of their encounter , he is not permitted to reveal what passed between them			0
however , the lawyer says that @entity30 239 ‘ boomed with laughter ’ when he told him about the @entity206 ’s torture report , and the @entity208 ’s self - justifying response to it			0
the reason for his ironic mirth was clear			0
though his name does n’t appear in the shameful report , when mr @entity196 asked him , some time ago , to catalogue his torture , he replied that it would be quite impossible – because he had endured it , albeit in a sometimes subtle form , on every one of the 4,600 - odd days he has been in custody			0
‘ if he were to write it all down , it would be ten times as long as the abridged report released by the @entity206 , ’ mr @entity196 says			0
it is a sobering thought			0
sobering , too , to learn that while incarcerated , @entity0 ’s father , a brother and a sister have died			2
his mother is ‘ critically ill ’ , according to mr @entity65 , who says she might not live long			0
she is blind and will never see her son again – but it would come as some comfort to know that her son might , one day soon , be freed and not have to depend on @entity2 to be in contact with his wife and children .			2
