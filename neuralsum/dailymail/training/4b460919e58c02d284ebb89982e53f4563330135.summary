by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 11:09 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 20:28 est , 27 february 2013 taxpayers face a £ 2million bill after plans to increase the amount that mps contribute towards their gold - plated pensions were quietly dropped			2
the @entity8 was expecting a 1.85 per cent rise in contributions to come into play this april – but yesterday the @entity6 ’ expenses watchdog made the surprise announcement that the rise was being suspended			1
it means the taxpayer will be forced to plough even more money into mps ’ pensions to plug the gap , at a time when millions are having to tighten their belts to fund higher contributions towards their own pensions			1
mps were expected to pay 1.85 per cent more into their pensions , but the expenses watchdog @entity26 has postponed the increase leaving the @entity8 plug the £ 2million gap almost all public sector workers are facing contribution rises of up to 6 per cent , and for staff in the private sector contribution rates are also going up			1
chancellor @entity33 must now find the extra money to make up the shortfall despite this , the @entity26 said it will put off any decisions on members ’ contributions until after it has considered the whole issue of @entity6 ’ pay and pensions in a report expected later this year			1
the decision means that policemen will be paying more towards their pensions than mps by 2015			2
mps ’ pensions arrangements are among the most generous in the country			0
they contribute an average of 13.2 per cent of their £ 65,738 salaries into the schemes , which pay out after they reach 65			0
in contrast , by 2015 policemen will be contributing 13.7 per cent towards their pensions			0
@entity6 have to pay into their scheme for far fewer years than ordinary workers before getting a full pension			0
and they benefit from a higher taxpayer contribution to their pensions than any other group in the public sector – almost 29 per cent compared with 14 per cent for teachers and nurses			0
a 1.85 per cent rise in their contributions was due to start this april but this will no longer happen following @entity26 ’s decision yesterday			1
it is expected that the @entity8 will have to find £ 2million to plug the gap – at a time when frontline services are being pared to the bone			1
@entity76 , chief executive of the @entity77 ’ @entity78 , said : ‘ mps should be subject to the same pension reforms they ’re imposing on the wider public sector			2
former pension adviser to the @entity8 @entity83 said it was ' rather unusual ' that mps ¿ contributions were not increasing when voters were feeling the pinch ‘ they say we ’re all in it together , so it ’s only fair that politicians contribute more to their hugely generous pension schemes to help repair our broken public finances			1
’ last night @entity83 , former pension adviser to the @entity8 , said : ‘ at a time when pensions are becoming more expensive to provide , it is rather unusual that @entity6 ’ contributions are not increasing when they are everywhere else			2
’ @entity26 said it deferred the rise so the contribution rate could be considered alongside other aspects as part of a wholesale review of pay and pensions			0
a spokesman said : ‘ mps ’ pensions certainly need looking at			0
and that is why we are in the middle of a fundamental review looking at both @entity6 ’ pensions and pay			0
