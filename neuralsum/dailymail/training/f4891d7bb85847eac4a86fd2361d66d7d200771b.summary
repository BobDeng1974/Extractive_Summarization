@entity0 is moving ahead with plans to ' desecrate ' the @entity3 d - day beaches with a vast offshore wind farm			1
the proposed 75 turbines each 100 metres high have been branded by campaigners as ' an insult to the memory of the thousands who died there '			1
@entity0 electricity giant @entity11 aims to install the giant white towers - almost twice as high as @entity13 - just eight miles offshore and easily visible from two of the five memorial beaches on the @entity17 coast			1
eye sore : the proposed 75 turbines each 100 metres high have been branded by campaigners as ' an insult to the memory of the thousands who died there ' ( stock image ) the turbines will be divided among five separate offshore wind farms along the coast , covering a total of 330 square miles and costing around ten million pounds			1
one proposed site is a 48 square mile wind farm off the coast of the @entity31 - home to @entity32 where hundreds of @entity34 commandos and @entity36 @entity35 perished during the june 6 , 1944 , invasion			1
it would also be visible from nearby @entity39 , where @entity41 forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties during the operation			2
@entity11 hopes the wind farms should all be operational by 2015 , generating six gigawatts , or 3.5 per cent of @entity0 's energy needs , per year			1
@entity46 : @entity41 soldiers land on the @entity0 coast in @entity17 during the @entity49 on june 6 , 1944			1
thousands of @entity51 , @entity41 and @entity36 soldiers died in the assault landing : @entity51 commando troops land on @entity17 beaches , during the d - day landings , june 6 , 1944			1
the wind farms will be visible from @entity58 and @entity39 beaches it is is part of a strategy to make renewable energy account for almost a quarter of @entity0 's needs by around 2030			2
opponent @entity64 , who is heading a campaign to axe the project , said @entity32 where @entity36 soldiers landed would suffer the worst blight			2
@entity71 , @entity72 , @entity39 and @entity73 beaches where @entity51 and @entity41 troops landed would be less affected , she said			0
but @entity75 , president of the @entity76 , said : ' we consider this project to be a sacrilege on the families of the 10,000 soldiers who sacrificed their lives to save @entity0 from tyranny			0
' @entity3 widow @entity82 told a campaign meeting this week : ' we owe it to these soldiers , to these veterans who were dog - tired but had the courage to land , to respect the freedom that they gave us			1
' desecration ' ? @entity91 @entity90 , where thousands of heroes are buried , is visible from @entity39 beach , in the distance ' windmills are ok , but just not here			1
there has been too much blood spilt			0
' briton @entity99 , who offers guided tours of the area , said : ' to imagine the events of june 6 , 1944 when thousands of @entity104 vessels arrived one needs an empty horizon like a painter needs an empty canvas			1
' opponent @entity108 , who lives near @entity32 , added : ' these beaches belong to history			0
it 's from here that the liberation of the world began			0
' it is an insult to the dead and do n't think the @entity118 would permit the construction of a wind park next to the ruins of a concentration camp			2
' but former local councillor @entity124 said she had met with @entity36 veterans who were not opposed to the project			0
@entity17 remembered : the turbines will be divided among five separate offshore wind farms along the coast where thousands of allied soldiers perished in june 1944 , covering a total of 330 square miles and costing around ten million pounds she said : ' they believe in the future			1
they have offshore wind farms in their countries			0
they are thinking about future generations			0
they just want their regiment 's insignia to be there somewhere as a sign of homage			0
' and @entity147 , a @entity51 councillor in @entity148 , said : ' i have received outraged emails asking , ' how can they have windmills on the beaches ? ' ' but two years ago i met a veteran who looked around and then he said ' this is not my beach anyway			0
when i landed these buildings were not there '			0
now my friends are buried underneath them '			0
' @entity160 , president of @entity0 ecological group @entity161 , said the project was launched two years ago : ' i find it extraordinary no one in government grasps that this will change forever the character of a place of sacred memory			2
they just do n't seem to care			0
' but @entity171 insists the impact on the view from the @entity17 beaches will be ' limited '			1
it claims that a 525ft - high tower seen from almost ten miles away is equivalent to seeing a matchstick from a metre away			2
a @entity0 government spokesman added : ' the whole project is being handled with the greatest sensitivity			0

@entity11 wants to build 75 100m - tall turbines along @entity17 coast
@entity187 brand plans ' insult to memory of thousands who died there '
@entity11 hopes they will all be ready by 2015 , generating six gigawatts a year
