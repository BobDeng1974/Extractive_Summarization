never buy a player on the back of a good @entity2 used to be the maxim in football , too many clubs having been deceived by a player shining for three or four games with their national team in the rarefied atmosphere of tournament football			2
however , some players do grow and mature more rapidly in the spotlight and appear to establish themselves as players worth watching by virtue of the fact that they deliver under the highest pressure			0
@entity18 is one of the above			0
going into the @entity2 the 24 - year - old @entity21 defender was widely perceived as one of the weak links in the @entity25 team , especially by his nation 's press who were unconvinced by his selection in the starting xi. in fact , most would have said he was only there because of the lack of a suitable alternative			1
watch scroll down for ' @entity18 nets magnificent half - volley for @entity36 vs. @entity37 ' rising star : @entity18 ( left ) came to prominence with a series of superb shows at the @entity2 central role : rojo in @entity21 's colours but as the tournament progressed , he established himself , being praised by fans and eventually the press as well			1
he has a degree of flair about him – he cleared the ball in the penalty area against @entity54 by flicking one leg behind the other , a trick known as a rabona in @entity49			0
and having scored the third and winning goal against @entity58 somewhat fortunately – the ball bounced up off his knee as he followed in a corner - he grew steadily in confidence , nutmegging @entity63 in the semi-final and then performing well in the final against @entity66			2
he more often played in central defence for @entity21 which is probably why he is attracting @entity69 ’s attention as a potential left - sided player in a back three or as a left - sided wing back			1
and he is quick – the @entity73 stats had his top speed down as quicker than @entity63 's in the semi-final against @entity75			1
born in @entity76 , 45 miles from @entity77 , down the @entity78 , he came up through the ranks at the @entity36 , the club most - closely associated with former @entity81 midfielder @entity80			0
dream team : @entity18 celebrates winning the @entity85 league title with team - mate @entity86 ( left ) in 2010 enigma : @entity80 was fabulously talented but his @entity88 career was blighted by inconsistency and a lack of defensive cover - here he enjoys a highlight , scoring in the famous 5 - 3 victory at @entity94 in 2001 indeed @entity80 and @entity18 were team - mates when the defender was starting out his career , @entity80 having returned to his home town club			1
@entity18 had a brief spell at @entity100 before signing for @entity21 two years ago			0
@entity101 hands in transfer request			0

@entity81 are *hoping* to sign @entity18 from @entity21
@entity18 played left back for @entity25 at the @entity2
the 24 - year - old rising star is central defender at @entity21
@entity18 's top speed in @entity2 semi-final was faster than @entity63 's
@entity18 will follow *similar* career path of @entity86 if he joins @entity81
