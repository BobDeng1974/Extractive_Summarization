space exploration is no longer the preserve of huge agencies who can spend up to £ 280 million on a single satellite launch			2
now amateur engineers - working in bedrooms , basements and garages - have the chance to launch their probes into space for just £ 12,000			1
for the price of a car , anyone who can send a tiny 5cm cube satellite into orbit to take pictures of @entity17 and perform cosmic experiments			0
founder @entity32 told @entity33 that he was inspired to launch the company after being rejected for a job at local company , @entity36			0
‘ my skillset at the time did n't meet what they needed so i had to essentially create a company if i wanted to be involved in the industry , ’ he said			0
@entity36 supplies @entity43 - a type of miniaturised satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly one litre and a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms			2
despite @entity43 ' small size , they can still cost more than $ 100,000 ( £ 62,300 ) to launch , compared to the £ 12,000 it costs to launch a @entity52 satellite			1
the smaller size of @entity32 ’s @entity52 has driven down the cost of launch , and elements of a @entity52 can be stacked up to create a larger satellite			1
‘ we believe small satellites are on the cusp of a major breakthrough much the like personal computers were in the late 70 's / early 80 's , ’ the company said on its website			1
while space research is currently dominated by large agencies , the ability to launch satellites on the cheap could open up a host of opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises ( @entity72 )			1
‘ small companies have short chains of commands , ideas can be implemented straight away and there is less bureaucracy and schedule slips , ’ @entity32 said			2
the @entity52 deployer , named the @entity82 - @entity81 , will next fly on the @entity84 - 5 flight on a @entity86 rocket @entity52 has teamed up with an @entity88 company called @entity89 which has brokered launch opportunities with a @entity92 rocket called @entity86 ‘ they also have the freedom to try new things			1
agencies may tend to stick to the popular choices as opposed to try something high risk with a low chance of success			0
’ @entity52 even helps find a launch vehicle			1
the group has teamed up with an @entity88 company called @entity89 which has brokered launch opportunities with a @entity92 rocket called @entity86			0
this was n’t what @entity32 initially set out to do when he started a company			0
@entity26 wanted to sell people the opportunity to have a space burial , with capsules of cremated ash being launched into orbit aboard a satellite			2
but they had to change course due to some legal challenges with the @entity118			0
‘ we have a really difficult environment for space startups to succeed in the @entity123 which has forced us to change the plan more than once , ’ he said			0
‘ startups in general have lots of challenges and it is a constant battle to raise funds and sell products , hence why we are focused on this @entity131			0
’ the company , who is based in a @entity134 in @entity28 , has developed a number of prototypes and is looking for @entity131 funding to develop commercial structures that people can buy			0
a number of satellites built to the @entity142 will be launched in november			1
these include @entity145 's @entity144 and the @entity147 's @entity146 .			1

@entity149 sells parts for satellites small enough to fit into your *pocket*
satellites built to the ' @entity52 ' *standard* will be launched in november
these include @entity145 's @entity144 and the @entity147 's @entity146 - @entity146
