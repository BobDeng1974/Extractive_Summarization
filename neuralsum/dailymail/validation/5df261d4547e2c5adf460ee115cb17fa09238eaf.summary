police officers have to do some of the hardest work in the community , and are often tasked with less than ideal scenarios to deal with			1
bringing the fun back into the job , however , are officers with the @entity8 police department , who are raking in followers via social media for their hilarious photos from the line of duty			2
it is not surprising that @entity16 's capital has one of the lowest crime rates in the world - with the fun photographs showing officers finding the time to dress as @entity24 characters , play with kittens and feed wild geese			1
it has long been debated why the crime rate is so low in @entity16 with data from the @entity60 in 2011 showing the homicide rate between 1999 - 2009 never climbed above 1.8 homicides per 100,000 residents on any given year			0
this is compared to the @entity65 where rates were between 5.0 and 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people			0
an officer dons a red nose , and another flashes a peace sign with ' je suis policier ' written on her fingers instead of huddling from the cold , the officers embrace the snowy weather by doing handstands posing in a police car , these female officers show that the job is not all strict rules and boring duties even the birds are fans of the force , as two officers stop to feed bread to a delighted flock of geese and swans colouring is clearly an activity not just loved by kids , as the officers pull up a chair and join in in 2013 , a man who shot at police became the first person to be killed by an officer in @entity16 ’s history			2
police said at the time that they apologised to the man ’s family after the shooting , saying they had tried to subdue him peacefully			0
they said he fired at officers with a shotgun from inside his flat in the capital , hitting one police officer on their helmet			0
officers gaze over @entity16 's stunning landscapes after a shift the public were treated to a fun day when one of the officers wore a bear outfit for duty breaking the norm of the plain uniform , these officers are seen wearing a flamboyant tie and bow tie kids gather around an officer to hear a story , with a stuffed bear dressed in the uniform next to him an officer wears a pig mask while perching on his vehicle at a police station one of the officers shows off her strength as she lifts weights over her head			1
