by @entity0 click here to view our brilliant @entity3 service including @entity6 's header @entity7 inspired @entity8 to a winning start at the @entity10 - but they were forced to work hard by an @entity13 team who looked early on as if they would be utterly humiliated			1
living up to their ' dark horses ' tag , @entity8 raced into a two - goal lead inside 16 minutes as @entity19 star @entity7 scored one and created another for @entity22			1
but the @entity23 could n't convert their possession into further goals and were caught cold when @entity6 headed @entity13 back into contention before half - time			1
they wasted a number of good chances to gain a point in @entity32 as @entity33 was forced into good saves from @entity6 and @entity35			0

referee : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) and in the end , it needed a stoppage time strike from @entity105 € ™ s @entity70 to make absolutely sure of @entity107 € ™ s opening night success			1
with @entity92 demolishing defending champions @entity111 beforehand , any fears this match would come after the lord mayor 's show were instantly dispelled			1
@entity8 's dark horses galloped away and it soon looked like being a procession			1
the players gave a rousing a cappella crescendo to their national anthem and , powered by a sense of patriotic duty , tore into their timid opponents			0
with their first attack of note , on 12 minutes , @entity58 did well to keep his balance and shield the ball from goalkeeper @entity76 sprawling at his feet			0
turning away from goal , he dug out a cross that was only half - cleared to the feet of @entity7 and the @entity19 star , unhurried by anyone in a yellow shirt , rattled the ball into the bottom corner			2
it was his ninth goal in his last 12 international appearances and the highlight of a masterful first - half in which he tormented @entity80 with his pace , flair and trickery			0
flying high : @entity13 frontman @entity6 climbs highest to head the ball home against @entity8 helpless : @entity8 goalkeeper @entity33 reacts as former @entity146 man @entity6 rolls back the years to score game on ! @entity6 celebrates his header with @entity83 ( right ) and @entity80 ( left ) before @entity13 could regroup , they were two in arrears			1
@entity7 collected the ball in midfield and charged to the edge of the penalty box			0
with @entity61 drawing away @entity156 defenders like a magnet , @entity22 was left alone to smash the ball home			0
it was @entity8 con carnage			0
the game had barely started , yet @entity8 were indulging in ' @entity164 ' football to the delight of their thousands of fans who had made the relatively short trip to @entity32			2
back in 2010 , the group containing @entity111 and @entity8 saw just eight goals in total			1
this time round , that tally had been matched in just 106 minutes as the frustrating caution of opening @entity10 group games at the last tournament was thrown to the wind			2
@entity8 dominated possession - their percentage share high in the seventies - and they hassled @entity156 players like @entity184 bunnies whenever they did n't have the ball			2
but their refusal to retreat and consolidate after taking a two - goal lead came back to bite them			0
coming together : @entity8 midfielder @entity55 confronts @entity6 during the first half of friday 's @entity191 clash block : @entity8 midfielder @entity58 is denied by @entity13 goalkeeper @entity192 keep going : head coach @entity193 encourages his @entity13 players from the touchline committed : @entity13 's @entity77 dispossesses @entity8 frontman @entity61 from absolutely nothing , @entity13 halved the deficit when @entity6 hung in the air above the static @entity55 to place an inch - perfect right - wing cross past @entity33			1
it was trademark , timeless @entity202 - the kind of header he has made a living out of for @entity206 and @entity146 and the national team			1
his fifth goal in his last five international games , he joined @entity92 's @entity210 in scoring at each of the 2006 , 2010 and 2014 finals			2
the @entity13 suddenly sprung to life and came close to equalising moments after when @entity6 shot low and hard against the shins of @entity33			2
grounded : @entity6 falls to the ground after being challenged by two @entity8 midfielders battle : @entity13 wideman @entity84 holds off the challenge of @entity58 at the @entity220 going close : @entity8 's @entity45 sees his effort on goal blocked by the foot of @entity13 defender @entity80 aerial duel : @entity8 midfielder @entity55 gets the better of @entity6 in the air to head the ball forward the momentum continued to shift after half - time and , after @entity233 vs @entity232 , the day 's theme of disallowed goals continued when @entity6 was correctly flagged offside as he headed @entity81 's cross past the @entity53 keeper			1
@entity35 then twisted his body to fire off a shot that seemed destined for the bottom corner until @entity33 stretched out a strong hand to halt the ball			0
finally , @entity8 found a second wind and @entity61 skipped through the @entity156 defence only to see @entity78 hack his poked effort off the goalline			0
it was all @entity156 pressure in the final 10 minutes but they lacked a cutting edge and , as the clock ticked down , @entity70 found the bottom corner with an accurate low drive .			0
