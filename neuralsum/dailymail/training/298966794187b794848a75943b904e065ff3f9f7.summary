if you put £ 10,000 in the bank five years ago and received average interest and paid basic rate tax , it would today be worth just £ 8,852 in real terms , according to financial information firm @entity14			1
the research was published as the @entity16 revealed that the rate of inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in may , up from 2.4 per cent in april			1
in contrast , workers are receiving average pay awards of just 0.9 per cent			0
misery : the record rise in air fares from april to may will add to the squeeze on family incomes fares : air travel costs rose by 22 % , much higher than other big risers like fruit , newspapers and utility bills the staggering rises in flight costs drove half of the increase in the @entity37 rate of inflation , the @entity16 said			1
stubbornly high inflation was worse than @entity41 expectations for a 2.6 per cent rise in prices , and is expected to peak around 3 per cent over the next few months to ensure a summer of pain for households			1
air fares rose by 22 per cent month - on - month this year - the highest increase for this time of year - compared with a much more modest rise of 1.4 per cent in the same period in 2012 , the @entity16 added			1
prices rose across @entity50 , long - haul and domestic flights , the @entity16 said , adding that higher air fares were not necessarily linked to the early timing of the @entity55 holidays			1
overall transport prices rose by 0.4 per cent between april and may , the @entity16 said			0
the price of clothing and footwear also rose 1.2 per cent month on month to tighten the squeeze on households , as the cost of women 's outdoor clothing increased during a colder - than - normal month			1
but food and drink prices helped hold back inflation , with price falls for meat , vegetables , fruit , sugar , sweets and jams			2
inflation is expected to surge even higher above the @entity76 's 2 per cent target in the coming months as higher gas , electricity and water bills , plus rising tuition fees , send it to a summer peak			1
rises : record increases in travel costs helped drive the @entity37 rate of inflation ton 2.7 per cent , higher than expected and raising fears it will hit 3 per cent this summer the figures come ahead of minutes due this week from the @entity76 's june interest rates meeting - outgoing governor sir @entity93 's last meeting - which will reveal the level of support for more economic stimulus			1
the @entity76 's @entity97 voted to hold its quantitative easing ( @entity99 ) programme steady at £ 375 billion this month , also holding rates at 0.5 per cent , amid signs of improvement in the economy			2

today 's figures also showed @entity108 inflation , which includes housing costs , rose to 3.1 per cent in may , from 2.9 per cent in april			2
ratings agency @entity110 said : ‘ ongoing price pressures combined with austerity will squeeze household finances through 2013			0
’ costs : incomes have been squeezed because price have risen more sharply than wages for months @entity118 , economist at @entity119 , said that while higher than expected , inflation 's peak is ‘ hopefully not too far away now ’			2
she said : ‘ inflation will probably get above 3 per cent in the next month or two - meaning that one of mr @entity105 's first jobs will be to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor			1
’ the @entity127 said inflation is down by almost a half from its peak of 5.2 per cent in 2011			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ to help families with the cost of living , the government has increased the tax - free personal allowance to £ 10,000 , which will take 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether and save a typical taxpayer over £ 700			0
‘ ( it has ) frozen fuel duty which has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they would otherwise have been			0
’ but @entity144 general secretary @entity143 said @entity145 is set for a ‘ joyless ’ recovery			0
she said : ‘ @entity145 's great wage squeeze shows no sign of abating			0
‘ forty consecutive months of real wage falls means people have less to spend on the high street , and are why economic green shoots are not being felt across the country			0
