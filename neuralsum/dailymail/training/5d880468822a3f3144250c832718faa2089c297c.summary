second season syndrome at @entity1 the way @entity1 are at the minute , you have to wonder if they ’ll go the same way as the last time they won the title			1
when @entity9 won in 2012 , they could n’t replicate it the next season , struggling in the @entity12 and finishing 11 points behind @entity14			2
if that was a bad defence to their title then , if @entity1 are n’t careful , this one could be even worse			1
@entity19 scores for @entity1 against @entity20 but the strike was n't enough to see his side avoid defeat the defending champions managed to score but may need to show their opponents more respect in future @entity1 are already six points behind @entity31 leaders @entity32 after just nine fixtures @entity1 frontman @entity34 trudges off the field following his side 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity20 striker @entity38 celebrates scoring @entity20 's winning goal against @entity1 with @entity40 @entity9 ( centre ) guided @entity1 to the @entity31 title in 2012 but was unable to defend the crown they are already in danger of going out of the @entity12 and have four fewer points than they did at the same stage in 2012 - 13			1
you wonder if , having won the title the previous year , they do n’t show enough respect to some opposition			1
that certainly looked the case against @entity20 on saturday			1
that combined with some sloppy defending and individual errors must be worrying for them			0
despite that they look like the only team capable of matching @entity60 ’s @entity32 and after @entity14 ’s late equaliser on sunday , they got away with slipping further behind			1
but @entity1 have to start performing and soon because a squad as brilliant as their ’s should be doing much , much better			2
@entity1 have trailed the @entity31 leaders early on in each of their two title defence campaigns @entity1 manager @entity66 looks dejected as his side failed to win at @entity68 on saturday @entity34 and @entity69 lead the way ... set - piece shame at old @entity72 with two set piece goals at @entity75 on sunday , it shows you just how fine the margins can be in the big games			1
when @entity80 slammed in that header , i could n’t believe what i was seeing			2
not because he had scored , but the way @entity14 defended the corner			2
i do n’t care if @entity80 ’s 36 or 46 , he ’s still one of the best headers we ’ve seen in this league			2
why on earth was @entity88 marking him ? @entity80 is 6ft 2in			1
before the game every team has a list of who is marking who			0
there must have been raised eyebrows when those two were put together			0
@entity99 covered the front post but he should have been the man on @entity80			2
then , without the height of @entity102 , @entity32 concede from a set piece at the death to draw			1
those are the kind of details that win and lose games			0
@entity109 that ’s twice now - against @entity1 and @entity14 - @entity32 have been 1 - 0 up , brought on @entity110 and conceded late on			1
it ’s not him as a player , it ’s the message of the manager			0
@entity60 is a safety first boss but when you make that switch , it tells the team to sit back and defend			2
unfortunately for him , it ’s not working			0
@entity88 can get nowhere near @entity80 as the @entity32 striker climbs highest to head @entity32 into the lead @entity80 silenced the @entity75 crowd with his header having missed the best chance of the first half @entity60 has twice brought on @entity110 ( right ) only for @entity32 to then conceded late on 76 % - @entity126 have been rock - solid at the back this season , conceding just five goals so far - fewer than any other team in the top four tiers of @entity133 football			1
it ’s not just the back four keeping teams at bay , though			0
keeper @entity137 has the best saves - to - shot rate in the @entity31 - higher than @entity142 colleagues @entity140 ( 69 % ) and @entity143 ( 66 % )			1
20 - @entity145 's goals against @entity146 on saturday took him level with @entity148 on 20 strikes for the club , making him their joint - top scorer in @entity31 history			1
28 - since the beginning of the 2010 - 11 @entity31 campaign , @entity153 has recorded 28 assists - 14 more than any other defender in that time			1
1500 - @entity160 's second goal at @entity161 was @entity163 ’s 1500th in the @entity31 - they are the second team to reach the milestone after @entity14			1
4 - with seven strikes this season , top @entity133 scorer @entity165 has four more @entity31 goals than any of his compatriots			1
this is a greater difference than between the top two native scorers in @entity172 ( a @entity173 10 , a @entity174 8 ) , @entity175 ( @entity176 6 , a @entity177 6 ) , @entity178 ( a @entity179 5 , @entity180 4 ) and @entity181 ( @entity182 5 , a @entity183 4 )			0
0 - @entity184 began his @entity146 career with a bang - netting five in his first five games - but he has failed to attempt a single shot in the four matches since			0
2 - @entity190 seem to enjoy playing against @entity192 sides - they have lost only two of their last 11 @entity31 games against teams from the capital			1
@entity197 after his masterclass against @entity1 , @entity31 bosses will be kicking themselves for not taking a chance on @entity202			1
the strikers have stolen the show at @entity20 this season , but @entity202 has been a class act in the middle			1
his time at @entity163 and @entity209 has given him a wealth of knowledge - he is so good at drawing fouls and keeping possession to take the sting out of games			0
he has helped free up @entity216 and @entity217 , and though he wo n’t get an assist in the stats , his pass to spark @entity20 ’s first goal was topclass , as our graphic shows			2
so credit to @entity225 for giving him a go			0
it is working out perfectly			0
@entity202 has been a class act since joining high - flyers @entity20 from @entity209 in the summer @entity230 is laying them on thick i was speaking to @entity234 in the @entity236 studio this week about @entity237			1
we see @entity237 producing the goods every weekend but @entity234 gets to work with him every day and he was effusing about just what a fantastic player he is			0
@entity126 has been perfect for @entity237 because if he went to an @entity163 or a @entity1 , he might not have got in the team			2
at @entity243 ’s he has become one of the main men			0
he is such a clever player and he set up another at the weekend			0
he ’s riding high in the assists charts alongside experienced @entity31 stars like @entity248 and @entity249 which shows just how well he has done to adapt so quickly			2
@entity237 , pictured against @entity250 , has been key to @entity126 's excellent start to the season @entity126 manager @entity234 has been effusing about what a fantastic player wideman @entity237 is 23 - the number of shots @entity255 has taken without scoring a @entity31 goal - the most of any player in the division			1
reds to build on the back the only good thing you could talk about at @entity265 on saturday was @entity266 keeping a clean sheet			0
it was their second at home in seventh months			0
for a team with title aspirations , that ’s just not good enough			0
there has been a lot of recent focus on the strikers and @entity255 in particular for not scoring , but they really have to go back to basics in terms of not conceding goals			0
that is the foundation of any good side and once that stability is in place , maybe then @entity255 might get firing			0
if they are solid by the time @entity289 gets back , he will definitely start adding goals to the mix. @entity255 has come in for criticism having not scored but @entity266 must go back to basics this season battling bony key for swans after covering their game against @entity146 on saturday night , i was very impressed with @entity299			0
they have made their best - ever start to a @entity31 campaign and @entity302 is excelling in his first full season in charge			1
they have some good players at that club but @entity145 is a real powerhouse up front			0
@entity309 has kept the passing philosophy and @entity145 fits in with that , but provides strength too			0
he bullies defenders and he loves a shot , so it ’s no surprise to see him score in his last three @entity31 outings			2
@entity145 has impressed for @entity299 this term and has scored in his last three @entity31 matches			2

@entity1 could suffer another poor defence of the @entity31 title
*current* @entity31 champions lost 2 - 1 at @entity20 on saturday
@entity66 's men might need to show opposition more respect
@entity14 should have had a better plan to defend set - pieces
@entity80 *towered* over @entity88 to head @entity32 into the lead
