heavy use of mouthwashes may lead to a higher risk of oral cancer , an expert claims			0
research suggests that people rinsing with such products more than three times a day have a greater chance of developing mouth and throat cancer			2
dr @entity12 , a senior lecturer at the @entity13 , said people should not routinely use a mouthwash and stick to brushing and flossing instead			1
danger ? a dental lecturer had advised against regular use of mouthwash , saying it could be linked to cancer poor oral health – one of the reasons people regularly use the rinses – also plays a part in cancer risk , he added			1
the research supports an @entity31 study in 2009 , which said there was ‘ sufficient evidence ’ that mouthwashes containing alcohol contribute to an increased risk of the disease , because they allow cancer - causing substances to penetrate the lining of the mouth more easily			2
in the latest study , in journal @entity44 , @entity13 researchers and @entity43 colleagues assessed 1,962 cancer sufferers and 1,993 healthy people in 13 centres across nine countries			1
doubts : the study also found those who used it to cover smoking and alcohol were more at risk those with poor oral health , including people with dentures and persistently bleeding gums , were at greater risk , they found			1
the study set out to identify risk factors for oral cancers affecting the mouth and larynx , as well as oesophageal cancer of the gullet			2
dr @entity12 said ‘ i would not advise routine use of mouthwash , full stop			1
' there are occasions and conditions for which a dentist could prescribe a mouthwash - it could be that a patient has a low salivary flow because of a particular condition or medicine they are taking			0
‘ but for me , all that ’s necessary in general is good regular brushing with a fluoride toothpaste and flossing combined with regular check - ups by a dentist			0
’ he added there may be a link between excessive mouthwash rinsing and people who use it to mask the smell of smoking and alcohol – independent risk factors for oral cancer			0
the researchers were unable to analyse the types of mouthwash because they were used many years ago by those in the study			0
professor @entity108 , adviser to the @entity109 , said the study was not ‘ conclusive ’			1
' it does , however , reaffirm that smoking together with heavy drinking and a poor diet over time are strong risk factors for developing cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus , ' he said			0
' unfortunately , these behaviours can not be disassociated from people who neglect their oral hygiene and rarely , if ever , visit the dentist , as this study suggests			1
' it also highlights that people , who are at risk of developing these cancers , may be using alcohol - based mouthwashes inappropriately to disguise smoking or drinking alcohol			0
' @entity132 should be used according to manufacturer 's directions			0
