when most people think of breast surgery , they envisage augmentations or reductions			1
but another cosmetic procedure is on the rise among women desperate for ' perfect ' breasts			2
@entity10 reduction surgery is aimed at women who are unhappy with either the size or shape of their areolae , the brown or pink area surrounding the nipple			1
women who are insecure about the size or shape of brown or pink area surrounding their nipples are resorting to surgery some women believe their areolae are too wide , raised , non-circular or uneven in colour and are now resorting to surgery to tackle the problem			1
the procedure is performed by removing a circular area of the outer area of the areola and bringing in the skin around it to reduce and tighten it			1
absorbable stitches are used inside the areola to reduce the diameter			2
in many cases , surgeons will use a permanent stitch which they place deep in the breast tissue to prevent the areola from widening after surgery			1
one woman who is considering surgery said her nipples has been compared ' @entity46 biscuits ' @entity47 , 33 , who lives in @entity49 , who had been hiding her nipple insecurity for years was ecstatic when she heard about the surgery			1
she said ‘ as soon as i hit puberty i realised my nipples were unlike other girls			0
they just got bigger and bigger – and they were much darker than my friends ’ nipples			2
‘ getting changed for swimming was mortifying – i was worried everyone was looking at me			0
‘ my first boyfriend jokingly compared them to @entity46 biscuits			0
he meant it fondly but that description stayed with me – and i ’ve never been able to move on from it			0
i ’ve felt self - conscious with every man i ’ve ever undressed in front of			2
‘ they have also been compared to @entity70 pancakes			0
they are so disproportionately large - it makes me so paranoid			2
@entity73 , of @entity75 's @entity74 , was so upset by comments about her breasts that she 's now considering nipple reduction surgery ' i do n’t feel at all sexy with my top off			1
i ca n’t imagine how any man could find them attractive			0
‘ my friend told me her nipples got larger and darker when she was pregnant and breastfeeding			2
the very thought fills me with fear			0
‘ i ’d never heard about nipple reduction surgery before - i thought i was stuck with them			1
‘ now that i know it exists i ’m going to save up to have it done			0
’ the surgery involves removing skin from the outer area of the areola and @entity47 is not alone - @entity73 , of @entity75 's @entity74 , is considering the surgery after suffering at the hands of bullies			1
@entity73 was horrified by the onslaught of abuse she received on @entity100 after she appeared topless in a zoo magazine shoot			0
speaking to @entity103 magazine , she said : ' i 'm having my nipples corrected because i 'm not happy with the way my boobs look			0
' i ca n't even take my bra off during sex			0
i do n't know if i 'll still have sensitivity after the surgery , but , to be honest , i do n't really care			2
' however , a loss of sensation is n't the main issue with this type of surgery			2
@entity116 , co-author of @entity117 explains : ' if too much skin is removed , scars can stretch so expectations are a key part of preoperative discussions			0
the average areola is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter			0
sometimes an enlarged areola is caused by the natural sagging of breasts due to age or breast - feeding ' however , i feel the trend is growing and results are usually very good , if the above points are taken into consideration			1
' plastic surgeon dr. @entity134 , founder of clinic 111 @entity136 , said of the surgery : ' women who are self conscious because they have large areolae , need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic			1
' an average areola is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter			0
sometimes a large areola goes together with natural sagging of breasts due to age or breast - feeding			1
' if you want to have a breast reduction or a breast lift done , the areola may be reduced at the same time to the desired size			1
an areola reduction can also be performed without additional surgery			1
' through an incision in the outer part of the nipple of the areola , the pigmented skin around the nipple or areola is removed			1
this procedure may leave a small scar around the areola			0
' an areola reduction does not cause any problems with future breast feeding			0
' dr. @entity134 said : ' women who are self conscious because they have large areolae need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic '			1

women now resorting to surgery to alter size or shape of the areola - the darker area surrounding the nipple
performed under either local or *general* anaesthetic
leaves *minimal* scarring
