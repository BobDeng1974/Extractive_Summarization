a @entity1 billionaire whose partner complained she was struggling to live on £ 10,000 - a - week has gone to the @entity3 in a bid to lift a freezing order on his assets			1
@entity8 was made the subject of a strict court order which caps his and his partner , @entity12 's , spending at £ 10,000 - a - week due to an investigation being carried out in @entity1			1
ms @entity12 recently told the @entity14 the order made it difficult for the couple to manage their homes and staff - who include three nannies , two housekeepers , two drivers and a personal trainer			1
today , mr @entity8 challenged a global order freezing on his £ 1.1billion assets by the @entity3 in @entity28 , which was made earlier this year after an application by @entity1 authorities investigating his role in the collapse of a bank in 2010			1
@entity8 and his partner @entity12 , have complained about a court order which restricts their spending to £ 10,000 a week @entity1 's @entity39 — the @entity40 , in translation , which monitors and safeguards @entity1 banks — is looking into the collapse of his @entity45 in 2010			1
the freeze prevents the couple - who have three children - from selling their two @entity28 homes or their villa in the south of @entity53 or doing anything to diminish their value			2
but it was a stipulation that their budget be limited to £ 10,000 - a - week which ms @entity12 - a distant relation of the famous @entity1 writer - branded ' draconian '			1
she said it prevents them from maintaining their historic chateau in the hills overlooking @entity67 which is set in 15 acres and whose neighbours include @entity70			0
she said : ‘ the budget for that house alone is £ 1.2 million a year ( £ 23,000 a week ) , hence the legal appeal			0
it ’s like maintaining a stately home			0
’ she added : ‘ apart from the five of us , we have live - in nannies and a live - in @entity80 doctor , because @entity8 has a heart problem			2
’ ms @entity12 said the order made it difficult for the couple to run their two @entity28 houses , their ' stately home ' in the south of @entity53 and employ their team of nannies , security staff and housekeepers there are three nannies who work in rotation - @entity95 , @entity53 , and @entity1 - to enhance the children ’s language skills			1
each one lives with the family for a week before the next one takes over			0
ms @entity12 would n't disclose salaries , but given that sought - after nannies can command £ 40,000 a year , while housekeeping and security staff may be on roughly £ 25,000 , the couple could well be spending about £ 250,000 a year on staff just for their @entity28 home			2
at the time of the interview , with the @entity14 , it was reported that the family also had five cars to maintain and run in @entity28 , including a @entity115 and @entity116 , and two yachts in @entity53			0
it was also reported that their eldest children , aged four and five , were due to start at a @entity53 - speaking private school in @entity28 in september , at a total cost of about £ 30,000 a year			0
ms @entity12 also admitted to being ‘ a clothes - aholic ’ but said she believes in buying investment fashion items in @entity28 , @entity125 and @entity126 , rather than cheap @entity127 ‘ tat '			2
she revealed that she likes @entity53 and @entity129 ‘ pretty ’ designers , such as @entity130 and @entity131 , and cutting - edge @entity133 designers like @entity134 and @entity135			0
she said of the staff payroll : ‘ people might think that ’s a crazy amount of money , but why is it a bad thing for @entity8 to pay that into the @entity95 economy ? ‘ those people might otherwise be unemployed			0
and why should the people who work for us lose their jobs because of some political thing the @entity1 are doing ? ‘ we feed them and pay for all their travel - we ’re good employers			2
hopefully they will all come in under the £ 10,000 - a - week budget			0
’ mr @entity8 started @entity3 action today against the order , which was brought in at the request of @entity1 financial investigators mr @entity8 - once called the ‘ @entity157 ’s banker ’ - insists the investigation into the collapse of his former bank is politically motivated			1
despite once looking after the money of president @entity163 ’s inner circle , he fell out of favour in 2010 and was eventually forced to flee the country			0
he launched a bid to overturn the freezing order today in a @entity3 case which is expected to last six days			0
the @entity1 @entity40 dispute his claims that the investigation is a campaign ordered by the @entity157 and insist @entity45 was given ample opportunity to pay @entity1 authorities			1
it issued a statement saying : ' the @entity40 believes that it has strong claims against mr @entity8 , who is accused of extracting very significant sums ( in excess of us $ 2 billion ) from @entity179 to the detriment of its creditors			2
' the @entity40 will contend that the freezing injunction was rightly granted and should be maintained			0
' also , the @entity40 rejects mr @entity8 's allegations , which have been widely reported in the media , that the proceedings are politically motivated and that it is an untrustworthy or corrupt organisation			1
' the @entity40 takes its responsibilities very seriously and believes that it is in the best interests of the @entity191 's creditors to pursue the litigation against mr @entity8			2
“ in relation to mr @entity8 's challenge to the jurisdiction of the @entity196 , the @entity40 brought proceedings against mr @entity8 in @entity95 because until recently he had not engaged in any way in the @entity1 proceedings and also because he permanently resides in @entity95			1
' provided that @entity200 formally submits to the jurisdiction of the @entity1 court and defends the case on the merits , the @entity40 is prepared to agree , subject to certain conditions , that the claim in @entity1 should go ahead first			0
' what is most important is that mr @entity8 faces justice , whether in @entity95 or in @entity1 , and that any judgment ultimately obtained by the @entity40 can be enforced against mr @entity8 's assets outside @entity1			1

@entity8 had his £ 1.1billion assets frozen over @entity1 probe
his partner , @entity12 , recently branded the order ' draconian '
she said it *hindered* the couple 's management of their three homes
it makes it difficult to employ nannies and *groundskeepers* , she said
@entity1 authorities are investigating mr @entity8 's former bank
he says the investigation is political and wants the order lifted
