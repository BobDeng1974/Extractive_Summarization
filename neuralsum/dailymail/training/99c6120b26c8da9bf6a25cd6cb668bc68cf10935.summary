by @entity0 published : 15:54 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 18 april 2013 when a tourist approached the bars of the orangutan cage at a zoo in the @entity6 to get a closer look , he did n't expect to lose his shirt			1
he got more than he bargained for when the cheeky animal made a grab for his clothing , tugged it off his back and eventually worked out how to put the t - shirt on himself			0
in a hilarious clip posted on @entity16 , the tourist is seen involved in a desperate tug of war with the orangutan , called @entity19 , as he tries to maintain his dignity and stay fully clothed			1
much to the @entity19 's delight , the tourist gives up the garment and makes a hasty retreat leaving the beast to run around his cage clutching his prized t - shirt and holding it aloft for all to see			2
in his attempts to mock the tourist , the clever orangutan attempts to put the t - shirt over his head , but a little confused , he only succeeds in putting it over his head and obscuring his vision			2
wearing the shirt like a headscarf , @entity19 bounds around the cage before considering another attempt at putting it on properly			2
@entity59 : the cheeky animal goads the tourist as he bounds around in his cage triumphantly holding the t - shirt aloft @entity63 : @entity19 tries to put the t - shirt on but ends up wearing it like a headscarf as he runs around his enclosure mimic : the primate holds the shirt aloft and sizes it up as he considers another attempt at dressing himself like a human much to the amusement of bystanders at the @entity80 , the primate 's second attempt to dress himself is more successful than the first			1
although the shirt is inside out and he only manages to put one arm into its sleeve , the ape mimics us humans and delightedly struts around his cage			0
it is hardly surprising that @entity19 manages to work out how to put on the shirt - orangutans are regarded as the most intelligent of the primates			0
they are known for being able to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools and make up elaborate nests to sleep in			0
experts have extensively studied the species for their learning capability			0
dressed to impress : the animal achieves a degree of success , getting one arm into its sleeve and his head through the neck of the shirt dressed to impress : the animal struts around its cage mocking the tourist who lost his shirt i want to be like you : @entity19 delightedly dances around his cage with the t - shirt on			1
