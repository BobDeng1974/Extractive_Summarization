@entity0 has a big decision to make			1
his contract is running down at @entity3 and he ’ll soon be able to join any club for free			1
now he ’s an @entity5 international , he ’ll be highly sought after			1
who knows , maybe even the likes of @entity9 and @entity10 will offer him a deal — they need to fulfil @entity13 quotas and he ’s a talented player			2
but a move like that is probably the worst thing @entity0 can do			1
does he want to play regular first - team football for the rest of his career or become the next @entity20 or @entity21 , picking up wages but getting next to no playing time at a big club ? @entity0 has seen his stock rise after making @entity5 debut against @entity27 there was nothing wrong with @entity21 showing ambition when he joined @entity10 — a move almost impossible to turn down			1
but his career has gone backwards since			2
@entity32 won 50 caps and five trophies at the same club but has never been a regular starter			2
maybe he ’s comfortable with his contributions but sometimes if you ’re not getting enough minutes , you need an exit strategy			2
it does n’t help when some clubs treat their players like commodities , offering them fabulous new contracts to protect their transfer value or hoarding them away to comply with player quotas			1
then negotiations become like a game of @entity49 — does the player stick or twist ? @entity21 's career has stalled after his big - money move to @entity10 the prospect of money and trophies is understandably tempting , but the focus should be on playing football and following a career path			1
it happened to me when i left @entity62			0
i had already played first - team matches but i was offered a deal over the summer by @entity3			1
i ’ve never liked summer moves — you can get overwhelmed by money men — and had it been negotiated mid-season with games coming thick and fast , i ’d never have left			1
but over the summer it becomes less about football and the money creeps into your head			2
leaving a top club might feel like the end of the big time but quick decisions have to be made for the benefit of your development			2
@entity84 will seek to revive his career at @entity86 after two years on the sidelines at @entity88 @entity89 moved from @entity10 to @entity9 before settling at another top club with @entity91 and @entity92 played for @entity3 and @entity93 before moving to @entity9			1
@entity5 manager @entity94 will also look beyond the top four for his players , so international chances will still come			1
@entity3 stuck by @entity0 when he injured his cruciate ligament so maybe he owes them			1
if he does leave , he must make sure he is going somewhere to play regularly			0
on that note , it has been a good few weeks for @entity13 footballers			0
a lot of young players have shown they are not happy to warm the bench and it ’s a reminder that this game is about more than just money			0
@entity106 left his boyhood club for the chance to become a no 1 striker and @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 all moved to play regularly again			0
whatever club you play for , it should hurt to the core every saturday if you ’re sitting on the bench			0
your whole life has been spent training to play and every week you are gearing up for that moment			0
if you ’re lucky , your career will last for 10 - 15 years , so you need to squeeze out every minute you can			2
that ’s why it ’s been so good to see these young players not taking the easy option			0
they could sit on the bench counting their cash but they have shown the hunger to play and it ’s that desire you want to see in every player			0
@entity131 @entity84 is a good example of the grass not always being greener			0
he was first choice at @entity62 before leaving for @entity88 in 2012			0
but was he realistically going to start ahead of @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 or @entity138 ? he sat on the bench for two years but now wants a fresh start			0
his loan could prove to be good business by @entity86 .			0

@entity0 's contract at @entity3 runs out next summer and he will be available on free transfer
the *midfielder* made his first appearance for @entity5 in monday 's 2 - 0 *victory* against @entity27
@entity3 stuck by @entity0 when he injured his cruciate ligament so maybe he owes them
