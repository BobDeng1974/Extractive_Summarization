by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:01 am on 19th december 2011 @entity2 and safety at @entity4 came under the spotlight after a grandmother who smashed her leg when she slipped on a plastic icicle in a @entity10 's @entity9 won the right to up to £ 30,000 damages			1
@entity13 , 73 , was having a photo taken with her family at the company 's flagship store in @entity18 when she stepped on an icicle - shaped @entity20 bauble and was sent crashing to the ground			1
mrs @entity13 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , fractured her left thigh and had to be rushed to hospital			1
fractured her thigh : @entity13 lies slumped on the ground after slipping on a stray plastic icicle in the @entity30			1
a judge said @entity10 and his elf should have spotted it she needed major surgery to plate and screw the fracture and has yet to make a full recovery from the incident in november 2009			1
mrs @entity13 , who was at @entity4 with her son , daughter - in - law and two grandchildren , claimed compensation from @entity42 , which ran the grotto , but had her claim rejected by a judge at @entity46 in march			0
after a hearing in which ' @entity10 ' @entity49 and his ' elf ' @entity51 , were the star witnesses , judge @entity47 said the icicle was ' not in plain view ' and cleared @entity42 of blame for mrs @entity13 's pre-christmas catastrophe			1
but that decision has now been reversed at @entity59 's @entity58 , where @entity60 , sir @entity61 and @entity62 ruled that the ' offending icicle ' should have been spotted by @entity10 or his little helper			1
opening mrs @entity13 's appeal , her barrister , @entity65 , said : ' this case may have entertaining ingredients , but this accident had very serious consequences for mrs @entity13			1
' ' we were warned off by @entity73 from any lightheartedness and so we were unable to use the phrase " elf and safety " ' , added mr @entity65 as he handed the icicle up to the bench for the three judges ' perusal			1
attacking judge @entity47 's decision to dismiss mrs @entity13 's claim , the barrister said : ' there was no justification for the finding that the bauble was partly hidden			0
even if it was partly concealed , the defendants should have noticed it			0
' it was not the family 's responsibility to see this icicle			2
they had the excitement of grandchildren going to see @entity100 and a very pretty elf beckoning them in			2
grotto : santa in his chair at the 2009 @entity106 event ' it is absolutely the responsibility of the elf and father christmas at all times to keep the grotto clean and tidy , ' he told the court			1
sir @entity61 , giving his assessment of the case , said : ' the family went in , preceded by the elf			2
@entity10 was there on his throne			1
there were eight people in a three - by - four metre room			0
two elves outside the grotto in @entity18 's @entity4 in 2009			0
mrs @entity13 has not recovered fully since the fall ' there are 10 or 11,000 customers going through ( the grotto ) in the course of a season			0
its a factory environment essentially			0
' it does n't strain credulity that @entity100 , left alone after possibly the 33rd visit of the day , did n't do a radar sweep to see whether there is an unexpected icicle			2
' lord @entity60 , allowing mrs @entity13 's appeal , said @entity10 or the elf ought to have seen the stray icicle , and dismissed claims that the grandmother was partly to blame for not spotting it herself			1
he praised the ' excellence of the system ' of safety checks @entity42 had in place , but went on to conclude that human error by @entity10 and the elf had led to the accident			1
' mrs @entity13 fell and injured her leg			0
why had she fallen , and was it anything to do with breach of statutory duties or negligence ? ' the judge asked			0
' on the findings , the icicle was there and it was tripped over			2
the question is whether it was there to be seen			0
' he added : ' this was a 72 - year - old woman going with her family and grandchildren on what was , for all of them , an exciting visit to @entity30 in which the anticipated pleasure of the children would have been foremost in their minds , ' he went on			0
' there were eight people in quite a small space			0
the accident happened when mrs @entity13 , at the request of the elf , stepped sideways and backward into the corner			2
still magical : children at this year 's grotto at @entity4 which opened to record sales last month ' it was not her duty in these circumstances to ensure there were no tripping hazards in the room which might cause something amiss			2
this was purely the duty of @entity10 and the elf			1
' the other judges agreed with his ruling , and the company was ordered to pay the legal costs of the case			0
the exact amount of damages mrs @entity13 will receive will now be either agreed or assessed at a further court hearing , but it is believed it could be up to £ 30,000 .			0
