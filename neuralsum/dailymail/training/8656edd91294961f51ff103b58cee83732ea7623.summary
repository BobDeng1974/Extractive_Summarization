guidelines that told millions of people to avoid butter and full - fat milk should never have been introduced , say experts			0
the startling assertion challenges advice that has been followed by the medical profession for 30 years			1
the experts say the advice from 1983 , aimed at reducing deaths from heart disease , lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up			1
@entity18 were advised by an official dietary committee to cut their fat intake to 30 per cent of total energy and saturated fat intake to 10 per cent , while increasing the amount of carbohydrate they ate			1
this led food makers to create low - fat spreads , including cholesterol - lowering products , while consumers shunned cheese , milk and cream			0
however , now some scientists even say the advice is responsible – in part – for the obesity crisis because it encouraged an increase in carbohydrate in our diets			1
a new review says evidence from trials did not support the advice			2
it says it is ‘ incomprehensible ’ that such advice was introduced for 56million @entity18 in 1983 and 220million @entity52 six years earlier ‘ given the contrary results from a small number of unhealthy men ’			1
guidelines from the 1980s that told millions to avoid butter and full - fat milk , should never have been introduced and experts say it lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up ‘ the present review concludes that dietary advice not merely needs review ; it should not have been introduced			1
’ however , many public health and nutrition scientists criticised the conclusions of the review in the online @entity71 journal @entity70 , saying wider evidence at the time and since has justified the advice and heart deaths have fallen dramatically			2
the researchers carried out a review of data from trials that would have been available to @entity18 and @entity52 regulators at the time			1
these trials were regarded as the ‘ gold standard ’ of medical testing			0
six relevant trials were found , spanning an average of five years , and involving 2,467 men – most of whom had survived a heart attack or similar event			0
the trials looked at the relationship between dietary fat , cholesterol , and coronary heart disease			2
the review found no difference in heart deaths , regardless of whether people were on a high fat or lower fat diet			0
professor @entity101 , of the @entity102 in @entity103 , said there was now mounting evidence against the introduction of low - fat diets to combat heart disease			0
carbs are heading the same way as fat in becoming a dirty word , some experts say			2
reducing or even eliminating carbs is a key part of several weight - loss diet plans , while many experts are blaming foods such as sugar , bread , pasta and rice for the obesity epidemic			1
but the @entity124 recommends eating plenty of potatoes , bread , rice and pasta with some milk and dairy foods , albeit low - fat options			2
reducing or even eliminating carbs is a key part of several weight - loss diet plans by 1991 the official advice in the @entity18 was actually to increase carbohydrates to provide 50 per cent of food energy			1
this was partly to make up for the ‘ energy gap ’ caused by cutting the recommended amount of fat in the diet to 35 per cent			0
but there has been growing disquiet with research suggesting eating more carbs , and sugar , has coincided with rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes			1
in recent decades there has been a huge rise in consumption of refined carbohydrates such as white flour and sugars , white bread , sugary cereals , cakes and biscuits – the ‘ hidden ’ sugars and fats found in processed foods			2
refined carbs are digested quickly , leading to surges in blood sugar levels – a negative effect increasingly linked to health problems			2
two studies published in the @entity170 revealed that people looking to avoid obesity , cardiovascular disease and diabetes should abandon low - fat dieting strategies for a diet that is low in carbohydrates			1
however many dieticians point out that a balanced diet is important , including fruit and vegetables , and demonising a food group could be counter-productive			0
they say unrefined or wholegrain carbohydrates such as wholewheat bread , brown rice , wholegrain cereals , beans and legumes are healthy and protective against certain diseases			0
yet governments in both the @entity52 and @entity18 have ‘ practically destroyed the dairy industry by suggesting that butter , cheese and full fat milk increased cardiovascular disease risk , when the contrary is true , ’ he said			1
professor @entity101 also said advice to increase carbohydrate consumption to 50 per cent of energy intake was blamed by some experts for an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes			1
he said : ‘ it is now time for the @entity18 government to grasp the nettle and stop an uncontrolled experiment , which has gone global and may have had bad outcomes in terms of the obesity explosion and creating a more unhealthy nation with the current idea of “ healthy eating ”			1
the review was led by @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , and dr @entity222 , @entity224 ’s @entity223 , @entity225			0
in 1983 , the country was told to reduce its overall fat consumption to 30 per cent			2
official guidelines were changed in 1991 raising this to 35 per cent , but saturated fats remained at 10 per cent			2
this advice has remained unchanged even though new studies have continued to suggest that there is no association between heart disease and those fats			1
@entity18 ’s saturated fat consumption is currently around 12 per cent			1
last year a @entity52 research scientist called for a campaign telling people they had been taken down the ‘ wrong dietary road for decades ’ in avoiding saturated fat while not being warned about eating too much carbohydrate and sugar			1
it is not the first time experts have blamed faulty interpretation of studies for creating a ‘ myth ’ around the role played by saturated fat in heart disease			0
researchers last year conducted a ‘ meta - analysis ’ of data from 72 studies involving more than 600,000 participants from 18 countries			0
it is a statistically powerful technique to reveal trends that may be masked in individual small studies , but which become obvious when they are amalgamated			0
a key finding was that total saturated fat , whether measured in the diet or the bloodstream , showed no association with heart disease			0
but cardiologist dr @entity270 , of the @entity271 , also writing in @entity70 , said : ‘ there is certainly a strong argument that an over-reliance in public health on saturated fat as the main dietary villain for cardiovascular disease has distracted from the risks posed by other nutrients , such as carbohydrates			0
‘ yet replacing one caricature with another does not feel like a solution			0
’ professor @entity285 , of @entity286 , said in the 1970 - 80s the @entity18 and other @entity288 countries were facing an epidemic of coronary heart disease			1
he said : ‘ it was effectively a policy choice between sitting on the fence and doing nothing or opting to follow what the evidence suggested – that cutting total fat intake would help prevent obesity and reducing saturated fat would lower blood cholesterol			0
anyway it seems to have turned out okay … between 1997 and 2007/8 cardiovascular disease mortality under the age of 75 years fell by 55 per cent			0

dietary advice from 1983 ordered cut of dairy fats and increase of carbs
@entity18 and @entity52 governments ' practically destroyed ' dairy industry with advice
advice to eat more carbs ' to blame for obesity and diabetes epidemic '
