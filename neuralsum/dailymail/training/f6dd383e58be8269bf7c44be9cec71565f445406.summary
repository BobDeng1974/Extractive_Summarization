by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:10 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 19 june 2013 postmen are poised to boycott delivery of half the country ’s letters , leaving @entity8 ’s mail system on the brink of chaos			1
an overwhelming majority voted for the measure , which raises the prospect of urgent mail such as debit cards , gas bills and bank statements being abandoned at @entity19 delivery offices			1
one in two letters delivered each day are handled by one of @entity19 ’s rivals , @entity22 and @entity23 , which print their insignia on the envelope			0
fury : a union ballot of @entity19 staff has displayed their anger at plans to privatise the company			1
workers could also refuse to work with competitor mail firms @entity19 is responsible only for the ‘ final mile ’ of the delivery – that is , putting the letter through your letterbox			1
in a consultative ballot , the @entity41 asked its members if they supported ‘ the boycott of competitors ’ mail ’			1
@entity47 , general secretary of the @entity48 , says the message from @entity50 to the government is ' loud and clear ' the results , published yesterday , were clear			0
of the 112,414 ballot papers which were sent out , 75,662 came back with a ‘ yes ’ , equal to a vote of 67 per cent			1
just 6,996 said ‘ no ’			0
yesterday the @entity41 did not name a date for the boycott to begin , but warned it could last indefinitely			1
its impact could be devastating			0
many of @entity8 ’s biggest companies use the services of @entity19 ’s rivals , including @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity19 delivers around 58million letters every day			0
the workers ’ boycott would be unlawful if it went ahead in the next week - thanks to a @entity75 ruling			1
but if it eventually goes ahead , mountains of mail could pile up in delivery offices around the country			1
@entity41 members were also overwhelmingly against the privatisation of @entity19 , with 70 per cent of those balloted saying they were ‘ opposed ’			1
ministers are planning to float the business on the stock market , a move which even @entity87 opposed			2
she said she was ‘ not prepared to have the @entity89 ’s head privatised ’			0
they have pledged to give 10 per cent of @entity19 shares to its workers , but the @entity41 yesterday dismissed the prospect of free , or discounted , shares			0
@entity96 , deputy general secretary of the @entity41 , said : ‘ postal workers are not going to sacrifice their souls for a so - called 10 per cent stake when they know their jobs , pensions and conditions are once again under threat			2
’ until january 2006 , @entity19 had a monopoly on all mail in this country			2
since this was axed , it has rapidly lost its key business customers			2
a statement from @entity19 said any industrial action could not only hurt the company financially but are also unlawful at present , ‘ around half of the daily post bag ’ is made up of mail which has been handled by a rival , according to @entity19			2
last year , @entity22 handled 3.8billion letters , compared with 1.1billion in 2006			0
@entity23 said it handled around 2.7billion			0
' postal workers are not going to sacrifice their souls for a so - called 10 per cent stake when they know their jobs , pensions and conditions are once again under threat ' @entity96 , @entity125 @entity19 is obliged to deliver every piece of mail to every address in the country , however remote			1
but its rivals can simply cherry pick the best contracts , such as a high - street banking giant , without ever having to worry about getting a second - class postcard from @entity135 to @entity136 , for example			2
many people already use the internet to access their mobile phone and bank accounts			0
and yesterday a @entity19 spokesman warned the boycott would further encourage the public to ditch letters in favour of emails			2
he said : ‘ any action against letters [ handled by rivals ] and parcels would adversely impact on large numbers of the general public and the postal industry as a whole by increasing e-substitution			0
it would also severely impact on our business , our reputation and that of our employees			0
’ fears : the union says workers ' jobs , pensions and conditions would be under threat if the privatisation plans went ahead business minister @entity171 said he was ‘ disappointed ’ by the result of the ballot opposing privatisation			1
' everyone agrees that @entity19 needs to change if we are to protect the future of the six - day - a - week , one - price - goes - anywhere service ' business minister @entity171 he said : ‘ everyone agrees that @entity19 needs to change if we are to protect the future of the six - day - a - week , one - price - goes - anywhere service			1
’ a @entity22 spokesman said it ‘ would work with @entity19 to minimise any disruption to our customers ’ if the threatened boycott goes ahead			0
after legal action by @entity19 yesterday , @entity41 has promised not to begin the boycott before june 28 , when a further @entity75 hearing will take place .			0
