by @entity0 published : 21:06 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 21:08 est , 29 april 2013 @entity4 's billion - euro @entity3 observatory has stopped working , ending three years of observation of the cool @entity6 , it was announced yesterday			1
instruments on the @entity8 's ( @entity8 ) flagship observatory have warmed to levels that mean it is now ' blind '			2
the demise of @entity3 was expected by astronomers as stores of liquid helium that are vital to keeping the temperature close to absolute zero have finally been exhausted			1
the @entity18 , pictured over a background image of @entity21 - forming region , has stopped working after three years observing the coolest regions of the @entity6 @entity3 took thousands of images , including this magnificent picture of the @entity26 galaxy after 35,000 scientific observations , @entity8 staff say @entity3 has left behind a ' treasure trove of data '			1
the pioneering observatory was launched in may , 2009 , and studied the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in a mission to discover how the @entity6 came to be			2
at the time of its launch , @entity3 held 2,300 litres of liquid helium but that has slowly been evaporating over the past three years			0
astronomers confirmed it had finally run out at the start of the spacecraft 's daily communication with the ground station in @entity48			0
the timing of its demise was accurately predicted by experts			2
professor @entity53 , @entity8 ’s director of science and @entity55 , said : ' @entity3 has exceeded all expectations , providing us with an incredible treasure trove of data that that will keep astronomers busy for many years to come			1
' the @entity61 galaxy in infrared light seen by the @entity18 an infrared image of the @entity65 nebula highlighting fledgling stars hidden in gas and clouds the space observatory amassed more than 25,000 hours of data from 600 observing programmes			1
the telescope was launched from @entity73 in may , 2009			0
weighs 3.3 tonnes and its lifespan was 11 months longer than originally predicted			0
its primary mirror is one and a half times larger than the @entity79			0
made 35,000 scientific observations and amassed more than 25,000 hours of data			1
the space observatory will be sent into permanent orbit around the @entity84 @entity3 is named after sir @entity3 , the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet @entity87 , and his sister and collaborator @entity89			1
@entity3 carried the largest and most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space and its primary mirror was 3.5metres in diameter - one and a half times larger than the @entity79			2
its telescope captured thousands of images of star - forming regions and was able to shine through obstacles that block visible light			0
@entity100 , @entity8 ’s @entity101 scientist , said the telescope had given new insight into the secret workings of the @entity6			0
he said : ' @entity3 has offered us a new view of the hitherto hidden @entity6 , pointing us to a previously unseen process of star birth and galaxy formation , and allowing us to trace water through the @entity6 from molecular clouds to newborn stars and their planet - forming discs and belts of comets			0
' @entity116 , @entity8 ’s @entity117 manager , added : ' @entity3 ’s ground - breaking scientific haul is in no little part down to the excellent work done by @entity4 industry , institutions and academia in developing , building and operating the observatory and its instruments			1
' in a demonstration of @entity3 's work , the @entity8 released images taken of the @entity129 showing cool lanes of forming stars in the finest detail yet			1
the unparalleled power of its infrared telescope meant it could capture infrared light from some of the coolest areas of the @entity6 , allowing astronomers a glimpse of these regions for the first time			0
the satellite , which is currently 1.5million km from @entity144 , will be propelled into an orbit of the @entity84 , where it will remain indefinitely			0
the billion - euro observatory will now be sent into orbit around the @entity84 , where it will remain indefinitely			2

@entity8 announced observatory stopped working
timing of its demise predicted when @entity3 was launched in 2009
astronomers say @entity3 left them with ' treasure trove of data '
carried out 35,000 scientific observations and amassed 25,000 hours of data
will now be sent into indefinite orbit around the @entity84
