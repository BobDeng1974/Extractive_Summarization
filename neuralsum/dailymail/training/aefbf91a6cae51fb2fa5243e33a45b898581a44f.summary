if you drank red bull in the last 12 years , and you did n't automatically grow wings , then you 'll be entitled to a small piece of a hefty settlement the company has agreed to pay for false advertising			1
but thanks to all the press the cash payouts have received , the check maybe much smaller than originally anticipated			0
energy drink @entity11 settled two class - action lawsuits this week , agreeing to pay $ 13million because their famous slogan ' @entity15 gives you wings ' is n't true			1
it was originally reported that anyone who bought a drink from january 1 , 2002 to october 3 , 2014 would be eligible to receive either a $ 10 cash payment of $ 15 in @entity15 product - regardless of whether there was a receipt for proof			1
there 's now speculation that the cash payouts will be much less since an influx of people are making claims on the energy drink'ssettlement website			2
according to the terms of the lawsuit , the company agreed to pay customers up to $ 13million , not $ 10 in cash to anyone who filed a claim by the deadline			1
it 's unclear whether the payouts will be diluted if more than $ 1.3million ask for cash payouts , or if the company will stop accepting claims after a quota has been reached			2
a spokesman for the company would not clarify whether the cash pool would be diluted with an influx of claimants			0
in order to claim $ 10 in cash or $ 15 in @entity15 product , you must visit their website and fill out a form by march 2 , 2015			1

the last time the website was up and running , these parts of the page could still not be viewed			0
the offer only applies to customers in the @entity87 in one of the lawsuits , a consumer who had been drinking the product for years wrote that they had experienced no increase in performance , concentration of reaction speed			1
' such deceptive conduct and practices mean that [ @entity15 's ] advertising and marketing is not just " puffery , " but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable , ' the suit says			0
' even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that @entity15 branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee , the @entity15 defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of " energy " worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine , ' the suit says @entity15 has agreed to change their marketing campaign , but insists their advertising was never misleading to begin with			2
@entity132 claims : above , grabs from a 2000 advertisement for @entity15 in which it claims to give drinkers ' wiiings ' ' @entity15 settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation			0
