unhealthy : @entity8 's sleep apnoea affected her health so much that she gained 27st and fell asleep up to 20 times a day - even when standing up she admits she was in denial about her weight and by 2007 would just focus on what she would eat next to ignore her tiredness and health problems			1
she said : ' i was a bad yo - yo dieter			2

declined : as @entity8 's weight crept , up her problems increased			1
eventually a doctor told her she had just one year left to live - and she decided to go for gastric surgery to reduce the size of her stomach but she is shocked she would now not qualify for the @entity39 procedure in the future if new rules are brought in because she does not suffer from a range of other illnesses			1
she said : ' as this is such a life - saver i can not believe the health bodies are thinking about reducing the number of people likely to have the procedure			2
' i ca n’t believe that only two years ago i was always falling asleep on the bus and having to sit on a stool to cut someone ’s hair			0
