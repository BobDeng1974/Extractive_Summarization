by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 26 september 2013 the @entity1 eavesdropped on civil rights icon @entity2 and heavyweight boxer @entity4 as well as other leading critics of the @entity6 in a secret program later deemed ' disreputable , ' declassified documents revealed wednesday			1
the six - year spying program , dubbed ' @entity10 , ' had been exposed in the 1970s but the targets of the surveillance had been kept secret until now			2
the documents showed how the @entity1 tracked @entity2 and his colleague @entity14 , boxing star @entity4 , journalists from the @entity16 and the @entity17 , and two members of @entity19 , senator @entity20 of @entity21 and senator @entity22 of @entity23			1
huge following : @entity2 waves to his supporters on the @entity27 in @entity28 in 1963 , government spies were concerned his activities might have been fueled by foreign powers and so tapped his calls the declassified @entity1 historical account of the episode called the spying ' disreputable if not outright illegal			1
' the documents were published after the government panel overseeing classification ruled in favor of researchers at @entity40 who had long sought the release of the secret papers			2
the intensity of anti-war dissent at home led president @entity46 to ask @entity48 intelligence agencies in 1967 to find out if some protests were fueled by foreign powers			1
the @entity1 worked with other spy agencies to draw up ' watch lists ' of anti-war critics and to tap their overseas phone calls			1
former heavyweight champ , @entity4 pictured here in 1960 , was also considered a threat by the programme which has since been deemed ' disreputable if not outright illegal ' the program continued after @entity61 entered the @entity62 in 1969 , and historians say it reflected a climate of paranoia pervading his presidency			1
@entity48 attorney general @entity67 shut down the @entity1 program in 1973 , just as the @entity61 administration was engulfed in scandal			2
the 1975 disclosure of the @entity1 program , along with other domestic spying on @entity48 , caused public outrage and one of the senators who had been tapped , @entity76 , led reforms that created stricter limits on surveillance and spy agencies			0
but the @entity1 has been accused of overstepping its authority and flouting civil rights protections since the attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
the agency carried out warrantless wiretapping between 2001 - 2004 and recent revelations from @entity48 intelligence leaker @entity88 have exposed far - reaching electronic surveillance of phone records and internet traffic			0
the researchers who published the documents wednesday said the spying abuses during the @entity6 era far surpass the excesses of the current program			0
@entity98 and @entity99 for @entity40 's @entity100 , a research institute that seeks to check government secrecy added that there is no evidence the @entity1 still operates in such a way			0
they wrote : ' as shocking as the recent revelations about the @entity1 's domestic eavesdropping have been , there has been no evidence so far of today 's signal intelligence corps taking a step like this , to monitor the @entity62 's political enemies			0

@entity4 and @entity2 were bugged along with journalists from the @entity16 and @entity17 and two members of *congress*
the government worried that anti-war dissent was being fueled from abroad so had spies draw up watch lists and tap phone calls
the program began under president @entity46 but continued under @entity61 and historians say it reflects the climate of paranoia
