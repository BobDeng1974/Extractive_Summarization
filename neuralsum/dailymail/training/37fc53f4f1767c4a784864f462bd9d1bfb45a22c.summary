if you are somebody who prefers to call a spade a spade , then you are probably not going to like this much			2
a @entity5 - based entrepreneur has invented what he describes as the ' @entity7 ' with a rotating handle in the middle of the shaft			1
the design is apparently intended to help improve posture and reduce back strain and wrist pain while digging			1
the age - old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge has finally been solved with a gadget that has 21 triangular holes that ' grate ' the solid buttery block			2
the tiny strips are much easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter so sandwich fans can finally avoid tearing holes in their bread trying in vain to get an even coating			0
the other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts			0
until now , the only way to guarantee a smooth spread has been to take the chilled butter out of the fridge and let it warm up on the side			0
but another invention uses a blade that transfers body heat to melt through hard butter			0
the technology means the device requires no batteries , charging or power of any sort			0
its designers developed the device using a copper alloy tube which instantly transfers heat from the palm of a hand to the end of the blade			0
the new design was dreamed up by @entity76 after waking up stiff and sore each morning while digging for his parents			1
he has built a ring - shaped structure in the middle of a fibreglass shaft , which contains a handle that can be rotated by 360 degrees and locked into 16 different positions			1
the idea is to allow users to set the angle that best suits them and the job they are doing			0
mr @entity88 , 25 , from @entity5 , @entity89 , claims that it is the first major revolution in spade technology in thousands of years			1
he said : ' it should n’t be normal to wake up sore everyday after using these tools , so why not come up with a way to make them easier to use			2
' i was using other tools as well , with perpendicular handles , like hedge trimmers and weed whackers , when i realized that this handle configuration can be used on a simple shovel			2
' for thousands of years , we have grown accustomed to using traditional tools - to the point where we expect them to cause pain and injury			0
' but research shows that we can decrease workplace injury by adding ergonomics to the equation			0
we have redesigned the shovel to reduce injury ' mr @entity88 came up with the idea after doing some work in a community garden with his mother and helping his father out on properties he owns around @entity5			1
revolutionary idea : shovel has a circular section in the shaft containing a handle that rotates 360 degrees no pain , no gain ? inventor @entity88 came up with the idea after getting sore doing work for parents @entity5 - based @entity88 has patented the design and is now selling commercial models of his spades after building a prototype from pvc pipe and glue , he patented the idea before appealling to crowdfunding site @entity138 to help him raise the money to build a commercial product			1
he has now set up a company called @entity143 to produce the spades			0
these include two designs for digging - which cost $ 69 ( £ 44 ) and another for shovelling snow , which costs $ 79 ( £ 50 )			1
mr @entity88 claims that tests with his spade by students at @entity152 have shown that it can reduce the strain on arm and lower back muscles when digging and lifting			1
@entity157 , a kinesiology instructor at @entity152 , said : ' we know from previous reports on snow shoveling injuries that a large number of injuries come from musculoskeletal exertion			1
' if a person can complete the same task with less muscle activity , the onset of fatigue may be delayed , which may help prevent musculoskeletal injuries that usually result from compromised or poor movement technique			0
' @entity172 handles : new shovel comes in three designs for moving snow ( left ) and digging ( middle and right ) technology has transformed the simple task of digging but it 's unclear how it helps when carrying wood			2

@entity5 based inventor designed gadget after getting sore while digging
spade shaft contains a rotating handle that can be locked in 16 positions
tests with students have shown it reduces muscle strain needed to dig
inventor claims it can reduce the risk of back strain and wrist pain
design available in three different models for digging and shoveling snow
