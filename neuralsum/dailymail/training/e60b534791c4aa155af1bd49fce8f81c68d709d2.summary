by @entity0 if you 've ever wondered just how much a star twinkles , this image answers the question			1
taken from @entity6 by an amateur astronomer it reveals the effects of our atmosphere as its light gets refracted - causing its colour to change			1
the image show @entity14 , the brightest star in the night sky			1
@entity14 , the brightest star in the night sky ( as seen from @entity19 ) , photographed as a timelapse from @entity6 @entity14 , also known as the @entity14 or @entity14 , is the brightest star in @entity19 's night sky			1
it means ' glowing ' in @entity23 and is outshone only by several planets as well as the @entity25			0
because @entity14 is so bright , it was well - known to the ancients			0
what came as a surprise to astronomers was the discovery of a companion star , @entity14 , in 1862			0
the companion is so much dimmer than @entity14 — 10,000 times , in fact — that it was n't until 2005 that astronomers were able to estimate its mass. it is highly visible in the @entity38 winter night sky because it has a high relative luminosity to other stars , and it 's relatively close to @entity19 ( 8.6 light - years )			0
if the star were placed next to @entity19 's sun , @entity14 would outshine it more than 20 times over			0
astronomer @entity45 from @entity6 said he took the image to try and capture just how colours stars can appear			1
' the twinkling of @entity14 had always fascinated me and since i had a telescope , looking at the brilliant star through an eyepiece was even more remarkable , ' he told @entity53			1
' the twinkling suddenly appeared to be more intense and i could faintly detect some slight but very rapid changes in colours of the blue / white star			0
@entity45 used a 70mm telescope to capture the image , holding the camera with one hand and the eyepiece of the telescope in the other hand			1
' i placed the camera near the telescope eyepiece and i could see @entity14 in my camera viewfinder			1
it was of course out of focus for the camera 's lens			2
@entity14 as we normally see it : looking south over the @entity73 sky , low and fast moving clouds reflect light pollution from street lighting , as the brightest star in the night sky , @entity14 ( the @entity14 ) rises low above @entity79 on @entity80 ' i manually set @entity14 in focus for the camera and held the eyepiece with the other hand and started to move the eyepiece in a circular manner , ' he explained			2
' the camera recorded whatever fell on it 's sensors for 2 seconds			2
and when the shot was done , i checked to see what it had captured and this is the image it produced			2
' he said he considered the image to be art. ' this image is the first experience i had with how our atmosphere plays around with star light in fascinating ways			0
' ask yourself how different is this from an abstract art painting and you would not find it to be very different at all			0
