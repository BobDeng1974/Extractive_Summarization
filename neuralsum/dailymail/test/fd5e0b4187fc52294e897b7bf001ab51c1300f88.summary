@entity0 believes the fact so many @entity3 players worked under @entity4 could give them the edge in this weekend 's vital match against @entity7			1
the former @entity10 defender last season led @entity3 to their best ever @entity11 points tally during a memorable campaign at @entity13 's			1
@entity3 fans ' goodwill towards @entity4 was soon eroded , though , as his departure to @entity17 proved the catalyst to an unparalleled summer talent drain			2
@entity0 ( pictured against @entity20 earlier this month ) says @entity3 have an advantage over @entity7 @entity0 ' assertions come as @entity4 heads to @entity3 for the first time since leaving despite that , just a point and a place separate @entity3 and @entity7 as a remarkable season comes to a close , with a positive result for the hosts on saturday enough to break the points record set last term			1
@entity33 would see @entity35 's men usurp @entity7 in the standings and bolster their @entity38 chances , with @entity0 , one of many to have worked under @entity4 , well aware of what a ' big game ' this is for all connected to the club			1
' the players never back away from ( the fact this is a big game ) , ' the @entity44 captain said			0
' it 's nice to be in a position where we 're having big games at this stage of the season and there 's an importance on it			2
' we 're looking forward to the game and hopefully we can bounce back and get the three points			0
' it is great to be in a position where we 're still challenging for a @entity38 spot at this stage			0
' we 've had a great season so far but we do n't want it to peter out , really			0
' it 's about seeing it through and saturday gives us an opportunity to pick up points against one of our nearest rivals			2
' @entity71 celebrates after scoring for @entity3 against @entity20 @entity7 are the only current @entity11 side @entity3 have failed to beat since their @entity11 return in 2012 - a run @entity0 believes the players ' knowledge of @entity4 's methods can help them end			1
' obviously we know how @entity4 works and how he sets up his teams , ' he told @entity3 's official @entity80 channel			1
' hopefully that will be an advantage to us in terms of the players as we know a bit of background ' obviously it will be nice to see him as enjoyed some good times under him here , but we 're confident going into the game and looking to take the three points			0
' the fans will hopefully get behind us as they always do			0
there will be an edge to the game with a returning manager , so it 's a game for everyone to look forward to			0

@entity4 's @entity7 travel to @entity13 's on saturday
@entity4 was *hugely* *successful* in charge at @entity3
