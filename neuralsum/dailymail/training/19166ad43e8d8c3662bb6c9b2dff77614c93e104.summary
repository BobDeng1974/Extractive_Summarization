by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 9 september 2013 with a vast selection of clipper gradings , combs , scissors and mirrors and television screens from wall to wall , these images are not too far removed from the scene at scores of barbershops on @entity12 all over the @entity13			0
but while some of the paraphernalia and equipment adorning the walls and worktops might seem familiar , the culture that accompanies them might not			0
much more than being somewhere frequented out of vanity and a far cry from some of the more glamorous salons we might be used to in the @entity13 , this fascinating collection of photographs show how barbershops in west africa are a place to relax , socialise and meet up with friends			0
life style : one of @entity33 's photographs taken of a barber shop named after the @entity36 president in @entity37			2
the photographer has travelled across west @entity39 capturing the culture surrounding @entity39 barbershops diversity : some of the barbershops captured by @entity33 would look at home in the western world , while some , including this one in @entity47 are little more than makeshift huts tools of the trade : as well as taking pictures of the barbers and their customers , @entity33 also took pictures of some of the equipment they use seats one : this barbershop in @entity59 , which is sandwiched between a clothes store and a vacant unit , is only big enough for one customer at a time hair idols : much like anywhere else , many of the hairstyles requested in @entity39 are influenced by musicians and sports stars			1
this is apparent from the giant picture of @entity71 in this @entity73 barbers @entity74 photographer @entity33 has explored the barbershop culture in an attempt to show how , like the @entity79 pub , the barbershop can be a sort of cornerstone of society in some @entity39 towns and cities			1
the 34 - year - old told the @entity86 : ' the barbershop is an intimate space where people come to discuss what they can not speak about in their homes or in public , including politics and even their lovers			0
' it ’s one of the few spaces where people from different walks of life , from different classes , mix. ' his photographs were taken in seven west @entity39 countries - @entity47 , @entity37 , @entity104 , @entity59 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity73 - and feature high end barbers all the way down to establishments that are no more than one man with a pair of scissors and a chair			1
sense of community : barbershops like this one in the @entity73 are not just somewhere to go and get a haircut , but also a good place to socialise or just relax no nonsense : some of the tools used to cut hair in this @entity73 shop look archaic compared to what we 're used to at @entity13 salons quiet time : these two barbers sit and wait patiently for a customer in their shop in @entity73 upmarket : this barbershop is perhaps one of the swankiest among @entity33 's pictures			1
football seems to have an influence on many of the shops but according to @entity33 , many of the styles and what they tell us about the individual choosing to have their hair cut that way transcends nations , cultures and political division			2
while some of the barbers were relatively plush and some as basic as you can get , most seem to be adorned with pictures of icons of black culture , sport and music - the inspiration for many of the haircuts requested			0
@entity33 found that often the hairstyles reflect the way that the customer wants to be perceived - in some parts dreadlocks are the sign of a ' ruffian ' while in others a style with a fancy pattern is a clear show of the wearer 's artistic prowess			0
blade : a customer is given a close shave in this barbershop in @entity47 colourful : this barbershop in @entity37 is covered wall to wall with posters of sports stars , musicians , pinups and even @entity36 president @entity179 family affair : the barber in this shop in @entity47 has brought his daughter to work and she makes the most of the lack of customers by relaxing in the chair something for the weekend , sir ? this customer checks himself out in the mirror at a barbers in @entity37 hangout : a customer in @entity104 keeps in check with the latest football score while getting his hair cut			2
alongside pictures on the wall of the likes of @entity179 and the @entity200 is @entity202 captain @entity201 different styles : once again football is an influence on the decor in @entity37 , but this barbershop features something akin to a menu of possible haircuts exhibition : a selection of @entity214 's pictures have gone on display as part of the permanent collection at the @entity218 in @entity219 new ' do : a variety of @entity214 's subjects pictured before and after their haircuts and shaves in some of the more restrictive @entity226 countries such as @entity37 or @entity59 , the haircut can be a statement of freedom and individuality			2
@entity33 was inspired to take the photographs after talking to a barber in @entity232 who said that he regularly cut the hair of a former @entity74 president			1
that made @entity214 realise the important role of the barber in west @entity39 society			1
ten of his photographs have just gone on display as part of the permanent collection at the @entity218 in @entity219 .			0

@entity74 photographer @entity33 has captured the importance of the barbershop in west @entity39 culture across seven countries
