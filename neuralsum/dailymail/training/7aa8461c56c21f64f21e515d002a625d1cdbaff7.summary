walking around @entity0 is a strange experience			1
it ’s not just the staff who are incredibly friendly , but guests , too			2
if i were to knock on my neighbours ’ door and ask them to fetch me a mojito , i know they ’d happily oblige			0
a spare toothbrush ? coming right up			0
everyone at this newly - opened @entity20 extravaganza seems blissfully , deliriously happy - from the @entity22 couple who excitedly tell me this is the tenth @entity24 resort they ’ve visited , to the young , amorous @entity12 slurping neon cocktails , who want to know all about the village in @entity16 where i was born			1
so my initial exploration of the 17 - acre site becomes a lengthy process			1
grab a cocktail , pull up a seat : the @entity0 resort is a pristine hideaway on the @entity33 shore @entity0 is a new addition to this lovely spot , a country which includes the main 120 square mile island and the smaller islands of @entity39 and @entity39			1
it ’s an adults - only affair ( no under - 18s allowed ) , one of 15 sandals resorts dotted around the @entity45			1
@entity33 is a ten - hour flight from @entity47 and the resort is a five - minute drive from the airport , on the south - western tip of the island , specifically a beautiful stretch of sand known as @entity56 beach			1
for this reason , i ’ve packed my ear plugs , but not once do i hear an aircraft			0
there are 225 rooms and suites			0
some have pools on the balconies , and there are butler suites where assistants wearing earpieces and white gloves dance attendance			0
guests are given mobile phones with which they can contact their butlers , although i ca n’t help but cringe when i overhear a portly , sunburnt @entity78 barking orders for beer from his sun - lounger			1
just glorious : @entity33 is home to some wonderful stretches of shoreline , including @entity84 i might not have a suite , but i ’m hardly roughing it			1
my room , in the @entity88 area , has an imposing marble bath tub on the balcony and a glass wall dividing the bedroom from the shower so , if you wish , you can watch your other half scrub sand from their nether regions			0
waterskiing , kayaking , snorkelling and scuba trips all come gratis , and , for a small charge , there are excursions outside the resort			1
i opt for river tubing and spend the day floating lazily along a river lined by thick , jungle - like foliage , my progress impeded only by clusters of rocks which cause log jams			1
with a quick shove from our guides , we pop free like corks			0
halfway along , we enter a deep lagoon and take turns jumping off a ledge into the clear water			0
on the way back to the resort , we stop by @entity84 beach , near the capital of @entity124 ’s			1
although one of the island ’s most beautiful beaches , it ’s surprisingly quiet , with just a few locals occupying the deckchairs			0
we have a quick look around the knick - knack - filled stalls then head to @entity124 ’s itself , home to the cruise ship terminal and a souvenir - filled shopping centre clearly aimed at passengers on a mad dash ashore			2
the spice market in @entity139 is a fragrant alternative , and the piles of nutmeg , cloves and lemongrass remind us why @entity33 is known as the spice island			1
capital concerns : what passes for urban life on @entity33 is lightly visible in the capital @entity124 's the snorkelling trip i have booked the next day is cancelled due to bad weather , so i opt for an island tour			1
one of @entity33 ’s darker periods was the coup - within - a - coup which resulted in the killing of prime minister @entity158 on october 19 , 1983			1
we visit the fort where he died			0
@entity158 was executed by the @entity162 of @entity33 , led by general @entity163			1
on october 25 , @entity12 marines invaded on the orders of president @entity166			0
as we now know , he had to use all his charm to appease @entity169 , who , despite @entity33 being part of the @entity171 , was kept in the dark about the operation			1
@entity12 forces took control of the island within three days			0
@entity163 was arrested and an @entity176 reinstated the 1974 constitution			0
elections were held in 1984 and @entity179 became @entity33 ’s new pm			1
today , the bullet holes that pockmark the walls of @entity183 are the only chilling reminder of this era			0
@entity24 is brilliant for people - watching because of its diverse clientele			2
some of the most interesting evenings are spent in the open - plan @entity191 bar with its dance floor and themed music nights			2
the shameless dad - dancing and inappropriate grinding is truly something to behold			2
a guest tells me that @entity24 resorts bring out the romantic side in everyone , whether they ’re 18 or 80 , but i ca n’t help thinking that the free alcohol also plays a part			0
@entity24 guests refer to staff members as if they were old friends			0
the more hardcore fans wear their @entity24 t - shirts like badges of honour and swap tales of @entity24 reunions			2
settling in nicely : @entity213 enjoyed a splendid week on the sands of the @entity0 resort there are nine restaurants			1
i develop a penchant for eggs benedict at @entity221 , where i appear to be the only person not chasing down my breakfast with champagne			0
another favourite is @entity226 , a steakhouse named after @entity24 ’ chairman , @entity229 - born @entity228 , who happens to be dining there when i visit			2
he ’s a jovial , grandfather - type figure who happily chats to star - struck devotees			2
in the afternoons , i offset the threat of obesity by visiting the gym ( @entity24 guests party hard , but they work out hard , too ; even at 6am there are queues for the running machines )			0
when i ’m feeling less energetic , i sign up for a round of bocce ball ( an @entity247 boules - type game ) and play board games at the swim - up bar			2
on my final day , i head to @entity250 and toast @entity251 with a pre- 9am glass of champers			0
seven nights all - inclusive at @entity33 ( 0800 597 0002 , www.sandals.co.uk ) costs from £ 1,629 per person , staying in a @entity257			1
this price includes return flights and transfers .			0

a ' hidden ' *gem* , @entity33 is one of the more southerly @entity45 islands
it lies close to @entity267 , and the @entity78 *continent*
the adults - only @entity0 resort sits at the isle 's south - west tip
