failing to pay your tv licence will remain a criminal offence after peers voted down @entity4 plans to water down the draconian punishment			1
peers voted by 178 to 175 to keep the non-payment of the licence fee a criminal offence , amid fears that thousands of families may refuse to pay if the system was overhauled			1
@entity15 peer @entity13 , a former chairman of the @entity16 , warned that ' dark forces ' were at work – and said he was ' deeply concerned ' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the @entity16 's budget			1
@entity15 peer @entity13 , a former chairman of the @entity16 , said he was ' deeply concerned ' about the uncertain effect of decriminalisation on the @entity16 's budget he warned : ' i would love to see the licence fee decriminalised , but there are risks in doing that			1
' there are risks the enemies of the @entity16 will see it as an opportunity to then move the compulsory element of the licence fee and move the @entity16 to a subscription model which would completely undermine the whole concept of public service broadcasting			1
i think there are dark forces at work			1
' @entity13 said that if the licence fee was to be decriminalised , it needed to happen as part of longer - term funding plans for the corporation			1
' we need to reflect on that in the context of @entity48 review not in a hurried order from @entity4 just months away from @entity48 review , ' he said			0
' i see no reason at all to interfere with the @entity16 's financial planning and i see every reason to support this amendment in order to take a measured look and so that we do n't interfere with the delicate financial arrangements for the @entity16			2
' @entity58 said there was a ' potential impact on children 's programming ' as , if licence fee evasion increased to around 10 % , it could result in a reduction in the @entity16 's revenue of £ 200 million			1
' this could mean that children 's original @entity67 content could suffer , ' she said			0
lord @entity69 told peers : ' we know nothing about the future of the @entity16 , we know nothing about the future of the licence fee and we know nothing about the impact it will have on the finances of the @entity16			1
' this is all basic information that @entity82 is entitled to have before making a change of this type			0
' what we do know is that some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this change are opposed to the licence fee to any event			1
' this is just a mini sideshow as far as they are concerned			0
they are opposed to the @entity16 as a public broadcaster and they advocate a subscription system			2
' we know that that is the case			0
' culture secretary @entity98 today said he would keep ' all options open ' about the future of the tv licence lord @entity102 said : ' i see it , quite frankly , as an attempt to constrain the @entity16 - it is a seat belt wrapped over the @entity16			2
it will stop them being able to do any long - term planning			0
' this great public service broadcaster will be inhibited from going into contracts of employment with their own staff , let alone staff that they need to bring if their long - term planning is to produce the programming that we demand			0
' @entity118 of @entity119 , an independent crossbench peer who put forward the amendment , said : ' under the current settlement the @entity16 has been able to plan its programme - making years in advance and budget accordingly			2
' any changes to the licence fee enforcement regime coming into effect before april 1 2017 would have a significant impact on the content the @entity16 provides			1
' @entity132 has backed proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the tv licence but @entity137 peer @entity136 , who wrote a landmark report on women in prisons , opposed the amendment and called for an early end to the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee			1
she pointed to the effect on women who were sent to prison and lost their children because they were unable to afford to pay the licence fee			2
' i know that 50 people a year are imprisoned because they do n't pay a television licence , ' she said			0
' they are not imprisoned if they do n't pay council tax and local authorities seem to survive			0
' she added : ' we should not allow the continuing criminalisation of this penalty because of the malign effect it has on an admittedly small number of people			0
' i do not think that the signal we are sending that the status quo is alright is acceptable			0
' @entity166 of @entity167 , a @entity16 producer and an independent crossbench peer , said that going ahead with decriminalisation would ' blow a huge hole ' in the corporation 's budget			2
labour peer @entity174 , who chaired the committee that scrutinised the @entity177 before it was considered by @entity82 , warned : ' the risk to the @entity16 of what might happen is so substantial because of the forces charged up against the @entity16 under other guises			1
' for the @entity184 , @entity182 of @entity183 said that when the licence fee settlement was announced in 2010 the then culture secretary @entity185 said there would be ' no new financial requirements or fresh obligations of any kind ' placed on the @entity16 before 2017			1
he said : ' i call on the government to honour that commitment , which it can do in part by accepting this amendment			0
' a spokeswoman for the prime minister said @entity132 believed decriminalisation was an idea that ' warrants proper consideration , that 's why we have put @entity203 in place to conduct an independent review of that '			0
she added : ' that 's due to report back this june and the pm 's view is that we should have the flexibility to act on the recommendations in that review			0
' the amendment passed in the @entity214 ' does not give the flexibility to act sooner ( than the licence fee settlement ) and that is exactly the point i think during the parliamentary process we will continue to make and seek to preserve ' .			2

@entity223 voted to keep the non-payment of the licence fee a criminal offence
@entity15 peer @entity13 warned ' dark forces ' were at work to undermine @entity16
former @entity16 chairman ' deeply concerned ' about impact of move on funding
move is a blow to the government who wanted to decriminalise offence
