nobody spoke @entity1 like sir @entity2			1
the actor , who has died aged 90 , was the last and greatest of a generation that sounded every consonant of every word			1
this theatrical knight confessed that three things made his blood boil : vandalism , litter and the misuse of the @entity1 language			0
it gets me so cross , ’ he would say , ‘ the way the ends of words are never pronounced , like “ yeah ” instead of “ yes ”			0
’ @entity2 , who played chief officer @entity18 in @entity19 , died on thursday aged 90 he won fame as a leading man in the golden age of @entity24 cinema , as a light comedian , as a @entity27 orator , in tv sitcom and as a @entity30 star his resonant tones made him a booming success in every branch of acting			1
he won fame as a leading man in the golden age of @entity24 cinema , as a light comedian , as a @entity27 orator , in tv sitcom and as a @entity30 star			1
that fruity — many would say hammy — voice was unmistakable			0
as @entity44 in @entity46 ’s @entity45 , he delivered the classic line ‘ some have greatness thrust upon ’ em , ’ exaggerating every syllable — ‘ @entity51 ! have @entity54 - @entity53 ! @entity52 ! @entity55 ’ emmm ! ’ but he lacked the obsessive drive of contemporaries such as @entity58 or @entity59 — rather than making epics or winning @entity61 , @entity2 preferred to potter around @entity1 churches , taking notes on their architecture , or to explore @entity65 by car with his beloved wife , @entity67			1
born in 1923 , the son of a chemist in @entity70 , in @entity71 , he suffered from asthma throughout his childhood , and left school at 15 to be apprenticed to a shopfitter			1
with his wheezy voice , acting had never occurred to him , but at the outbreak of war his cousin , an amateur actor , was called up and @entity2 became his stand - in for an am - dram production in @entity83			1
to his surprise , he was a natural			0
he was talent - spotted by the director of a wartime entertainment unit , and spent the rest of the war learning joinery in the workshop each day and touring @entity92 training camps and anti-aircraft batteries each evening			1
‘ i was either brilliant , or they could n’t find anyone else , ’ he joked			0
when his own call - up papers came , he was ruled medically unfit for duty owing to his asthma			2
so he entertained the troops — in 1945 , he toured @entity100 and @entity101 with @entity102 , the @entity102 ( also known as @entity102 )			0
then he trained at the @entity104 drama school in @entity105 , where voice coaches helped him develop his thundering bass delivery , with syllables that sounded like lumps of falling masonry			0
he met @entity111 after earning a place at the @entity113 in @entity114 as an understudy			0
@entity67 was playing @entity116 in dr @entity117 , and @entity118 in @entity119			0
‘ she had a line in goddesses that season , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ she was a classical - looking lady , statuesque and beautiful			2
’ sir @entity2 , pictured outside @entity122 after receiving his knighthood , had prostate cancer @entity2 ( right ) played @entity125 , a snooty antiques dealer , in sitution comedy never the @entity127 the first time he proposed , by moonlight on a bridge over the @entity130 , she declined			1
but he persevered , and they married in 1948			0
@entity67 gave up her career to raise their family : they had two children , @entity138 and @entity139 , both actors			2
the devoted couple were together for more than 55 years until @entity67 ’s death from cancer , aged 77 , in 2004			2
while she had been caring for their babies , @entity2 tirelessly made his name as an actor			1
in a 19 - month run during the @entity148 at the @entity149 in @entity150 , he never missed a show			2
the management gave him an engraved silver ashtray to mark his achievement of giving more consecutive performances than any other actor in the theatre ’s history			2
the ashtray was appropriate — despite his asthma , @entity2 would for much of his life puff through two or more packs a day			1
his cinema breakthrough came in 1953 with an adaptation of @entity164 , @entity165 ’s novel about the battle between the @entity167 and @entity169 u-boats hunting @entity171 convoys during @entity172 @entity173 , then the country ’s biggest star , was the commander of a sub-hunter , and newcomer @entity2 was his brave but inexperienced junior , in a father - son relationship that many film buffs believe would have earned them @entity61 for best actor and best supporting actor , had the movie been made in @entity182			1
the honours went to @entity184 with @entity185 , the mumbling , slurring antithesis of everything @entity2 stood for			1
his loathing of ‘ method ’ acting won @entity2 an unexpected admirer , @entity192			1
their dressing rooms at @entity195 were four doors apart while she was filming @entity197 , and he another movie , and @entity2 mocked her attempts at @entity185 - style naturalism			1
he hung a sign on his door advertising his own drama classes , guaranteed to out - do the method : ‘ you too can be inaudible ! “ @entity206 ” and “ @entity207 ” rendered obsolete ! ’ @entity192 saw the joke and started dropping in , not for acting lessons but to offload her troubles			2
‘ she popped in for a natter and a giggle , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ of course as a sex symbol she was stunning , but sadly , she must be one of the silliest women i have ever met			0
’ accolades were heaped on him for @entity45 and @entity218 , in which he acted with @entity219 , and for his @entity220 the @entity222 was followed by another war classic , @entity224 , as well as lighter films , like @entity19 , @entity221 and the romantic farce @entity226			0
@entity2 played @entity228 , the eternal medical student who spends his time boozing and chasing nurses			1
when he saw a girl he liked , @entity228 , instead of wolf - whistling , would emit a gutteral growl			2
this sexy - but - safe persona won him stardom , and he was voted the face @entity24 housewives would most like to see across their breakfast tables			2
but it also prevented him from being taken seriously			0
when a sex scandal forced @entity24 ’s highest - paid tv star @entity243 out of his hit @entity245 sitcom , our man at @entity241 ’s in 1963 , the lovable but harmless @entity2 was the obvious choice to take over			1
he became so disillusioned at the way film producers refused to cast him in serious roles that he quit his contact with @entity252 studios and returned to @entity114			2
under director @entity253 he played the @entity254 in @entity255 , an adaptation of @entity46 ’s @entity258 trilogy , and took the play to the @entity30			0
he followed that with a restoration comedy , @entity268 , as the ludicrously camp @entity262 , with rosebud lips and an orange head - dress based on wigs worn by female impersonator @entity266			2
sir @entity2 died at his home in @entity271 , @entity272 , 10 years after his wife passed away accolades were heaped on him for @entity45 and @entity218 , in which he acted with @entity219 , and for his @entity220			1
in 1979 he became the last white actor to play @entity276 at @entity114 with his face blackened			2
it ’s a performance i was lucky enough to see : he was heartfelt and tragic as the @entity281 general who kills his wife in a jealous rage			0
but the black - and - white minstrel ’s make - up , contrasted with the plummy vowels , seemed too dated to be taken seriously			0
though not yet 60 , @entity2 sensed that his era in the theatre was passing			1
he fell back on television , as @entity290 ’s butler in @entity291 and as an antiques dealer in @entity293 , which ran for ten years			0
it became a family affair : sons @entity138 and @entity139 played police officers in one episode , while @entity67 was in the final show			0
his passion for religious architecture led him to present a @entity306 documentary series in 1988 , the @entity302 , in which his delivery was so orotund and opulent that he earned his own puppet on @entity308			0
his character was usually seen pleading for a knighthood ( the real one arrived in 1997 )			0
and at a restaurant , the @entity313 puppet summoned a waiter and boomed : ‘ do you serve a ham salad ? ’ yes , came the reply — they served salad to anyone			0
he and @entity67 were devastated by the death of @entity138 , aged 45 , from cancer in 1996			0
@entity2 continued to work in television , but his great pleasure in later life was to regale friends at the @entity329 with theatrical anecdotes — and the printable ones were collected into an @entity333 book			1
his voice came to be known as the defining sound of the @entity329			0
it was the sound of a vanished age of @entity1 theatre , too			0
no actor will ever again declaim his lines with such majesty as @entity2 .			1

sir @entity2 died on thursday after a battle with prostate cancer
