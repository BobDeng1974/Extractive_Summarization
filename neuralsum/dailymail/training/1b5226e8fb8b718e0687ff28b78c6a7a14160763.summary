by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 26 february 2013 fish oil could protect sun - worshippers from skin cancer , new research suggests			1
scientists from the @entity6 have discovered that omega - 3 acids in the oil boost the immune system , affecting the body 's ability to fight skin cancer and infection			1
it is the first time the protective effect of @entity15 - commonly found in fish and plant oils - has been demonstrated in humans			2
@entity15 acid reduces the way sunlight suppresses the immune system , scientists believe the research team , from the university 's photobiology unit , claim the oils reduced the sun 's impact on the immune system by half			1
exposure to a lot of uv radiation from the sun can suppress the immune system , which affects the body ’s ability to fight skin cancer and infection			1
team leader professor @entity38 , who also works for @entity39 , described the findings as ' very exciting '			0
he added : ‘ it has taken a number of years to get to this stage			0
‘ this study adds to the evidence that @entity15 is a potential nutrient to protect against skin cancer			1
' he added that although the changes when someone took the oil were small , they suggest that @entity15 could reduce the risk of skin cancer over an individual 's lifetime			1
‘ there has been research in this area carried out on mice in the past but this is the first time that there has been a clinical trial directly in people			0
’ fish oil has also been shown to have other beneficial health effects , such as combating cardiovascular disease the study was published in @entity69			0
the 79 patients who volunteered for the trial took a 4g dose of @entity15 - about one and a half portions of oily fish - daily , before being exposed to the equivalent of either eight , 15 or 30 minutes of summer midday sun in @entity6 using a special light machine			1
other patients took a placebo , before being exposed to the light machine			0
suppression of the immune system was 50 per cent lower in people who took the supplement and were exposed to eight and 15 minutes of sun , compared with people who did not take the supplement			2
the study showed little influence on those in the 30 - minute group			0
fish oil has already been shown to have many beneficial health effects , such as helping with cardiovascular disease			0
prof @entity38 ' team are now continuing their research with further omega - 3 studies being carried out on healthy volunteers at @entity39			0
around 100,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer were diagnosed in the @entity100 in 2010 , according to the most recent figures available , making it an extremely common cancer .			2

@entity15 *fatty* acids found to halve the *negative* effect sunlight can have on the immune system
boost the body 's ability to fight skin cancer
but the benefits only hold for less than 30 minutes of sun exposure at a time , warn the researchers
