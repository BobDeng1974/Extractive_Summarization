a couple who were doing more than catching up on their paper work in a @entity4 insurance office unwittingly also gave patrons of a nearby bar a proper night â€™s adult entertainment			1
the office sex romp took place last friday night in the @entity11 offices when the two employees left the lights on in the building on @entity15 while they got to know each other better			1
unfortunately for them their fun was filmed and photographed by revellers at the @entity19 and @entity20 across the street who posted images on @entity24 and @entity25			1
' the whole pub knew about it and was watching , while they were totally oblivious to it			0
and afterwards celebrating with wine , ' one man posted			2
' they should have turned the lights out , ' said another			2
some patrons even said that the band stopped playing while most of the bar watched out the windows			1
it got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the @entity19 and @entity20 as the action continued @entity11 chief executive @entity66 said the company was taking the matter seriously			1
the man and woman had been identified and an employment investigation was under way			1
' we know who is involved			0
it 's obvious from the photos , ' @entity66 said			0
@entity66 would not say if the man and woman had returned to work , but that they were taking the matter very seriously and they may end up losing their jobs			0
' it 's not the type of behaviour we condone			0
it 's very disappointing , ' he said			0
all the unwanted online publicity was also embarrassing the company and this was not how they wanted to be portrayed			0
revellers at the @entity19 and @entity20 posted images on @entity24 and @entity25 of the couple ' one of the challenges of social media is the inability to control things , ' he said			1
@entity19 owner @entity101 said the bar had been in contact with @entity104 ' obviously they 're customers and we 're working through it with them , ' he said			2
the couple could still escape with a warning if a disciplinary inquiry finds that the encounter did not amount to serious misconduct .			0
