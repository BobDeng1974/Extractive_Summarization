witness reports , photographs and video footage gives an idea of the bravery carried out by these two men			1
@entity34 and @entity35 , whose real names have not been disclosed , arrived at the building and immediately noticed there was no police cordon and that there were bodies lying on a balcony of a ground - floor cafe			1
they decided to carry out a rescue operation and managed to make their way into the underground car park where they discovered 100 people hiding behind an armoured cash - delivery truck			1
children as young as five were shot up to five times by the terrorists that carried out the @entity14 massacre despite heavy gunfire , @entity34 , who served in the @entity56 for 18 - years and @entity35 , a former ranger , instructed them to safety and out of the building			1
they then took the decision to climb down the fire escape and into @entity64 coffee shop with plain - clothed @entity66 police reservists and two officers with @entity69 assault rifles where 20 people lay dead			2
witnesses recalled seeing a white man in a checked shirt trying to persuade people onto a fire escape			2

as he came across the deceased he covered their bodies with red cloths which had been covering tables where parents and their children sat. @entity35 made his way to the sushi restaurant and began evacuating the eatery			2
