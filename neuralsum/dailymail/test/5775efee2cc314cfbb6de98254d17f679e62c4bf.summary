this is the dramatic moment two @entity1 came into land above an astonished father and son			2
the video captured by @entity6 while out with his seven - year - old stepson @entity7 shows the £ 126million jets approaching @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the first of the aircraft - which can reach 1,370mph - blasted them with the thrust from its engines , while as the second jet disappeared from view the video camera was knocked sideways			1
mr @entity6 , who runs an aerial photography business in @entity34 , @entity35 , captured the video on tuesday with a @entity37 4 while on holiday with his family			1
the 41 - year - old said that he was ‘ as close to the action as you could get ’ , having gone to the area after hearing on the news that @entity44 exercises were taking place in the area			1
he said : ‘ i went to see what i could capture			0
i was n't really sure what i would get but it was fantastic watching the video back			2
‘ they came in very low and were preparing to land , but they were still under quite a lot of throttle			0
to see that much thrust is quite astonishing			0
my stepson is still making jet noises			1
’ he added : ‘ it 's the first time i 've seen a @entity1 in flight and the noise was just incredible			0
caught on camera : mr @entity6 took the video on tuesday with a @entity37 4 while on holiday with his family ' you can hear it approach from far away , but when it 's above you have to fight every instinct not to duck or put your hands over your ears			1
‘ shortly after taking this video we were actually told we should probably move a bit away since the planes were coming in to land			2
’ as well as the bombers on tuesday , a @entity29 warship strayed close to @entity32 territory in another apparent attempt to test @entity32 ’s defences			1
a destroyer with missiles , anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the @entity87 with two other @entity29 ships			0
it forced the @entity32 to send a heavily - armed frigate to monitor the vessels			2
just a few hours later the @entity28 bombers hugged @entity32 airspace			0
sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘ snoop ’ on the @entity44 war games exercise taking place in @entity11			0
even though @entity29 military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength , the timing raised suspicions that @entity104 was using access to the site to test @entity32 reaction times			0
it later emerged that the @entity29 had actually been at the @entity1 ’ base at @entity9 when the warplanes were scrambled .			1
