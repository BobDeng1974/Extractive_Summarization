' the infamous chalk boards : @entity67 may have graphics , but @entity5 has chalkboards , @entity1 told his audience the show , broadcast live , kicked off with @entity1 reliving the last two - and - a - half years with a montage of best bits			1
before that he had taken the cameras back stage to see where the props for the show were kept or ' magnet alley ' as he called it			0
floor to ceiling shelves groaned under the weight of aids the @entity5 host had used over the years to express certain metaphors			2
quiet what a chainsaw was doing there was anyone 's guess			0
looking back : @entity1 admitted he 'd done many things in order to ' hack the left off ' as he went over his best bits there was also cases and cases of chalk for writing on the infamous chalkboards of the show			2
@entity1 later joked that ' @entity67 use graphics , we use chalkboards , ' adding that he always felt as though he had chalk on his trousers			2
there was some speculation @entity1 may cry			2
he did n't but there were many emotional moments - genuine and hammed			2
' i 've met amazing friends ' on this show , he said			0
' @entity1 then went on to talk about all the ' amazing ' things the @entity113 has taught the people of @entity39			2
end of an era : the blinds go up and the set is dismantled as @entity1 says a final farewell to his audience should the topics have slipped anyone 's memory , they were all handily written up on a chalkboard titled : ' things we 've learned			1
' ' how many people knew about the great depression of 1920 ' before the show ? asked @entity1			2
' ' we are the same , me and you , ' he continued before adding : ' i may be able to figure out some things little faster than you			0
' he 's well known for going on a bit but in tonight 's show @entity1 actually celebrated his ' staggeringly long monologues ' saying that a 21 minute stint was normal for the show now			1
he even took on @entity142 , berating him for having ' so many writers ' for ' just six minutes ' worth of material			0
he then brought in his show 's writers , all two of them			0
they shuffled about and looked at the floor for a bit before the show went to a commercial break			0
@entity1 , teasing the audience , kept suggesting he would reveal the real reason why he was leaving ' next , ' but never quite made it			2
' there were people who said i was fired , ' @entity1 said in a booming voice before going on to suggest if he had been sacked he would n't be in the midst of a live broadcast			1
many asked if he was negotiating his contract @entity1 added , even his agent			0
but in the end @entity1 said he was standing in his @entity166 apartment looking at the skyline after ' hanging out with @entity168 ' backstage after watching @entity169 : turn off the @entity171 musical , currently on @entity172 , and thought : ' if you do n't leave now , you will not leave with your soul			1
' never want anything too much , ' he said			0
' it will destroy you			0
' @entity1 ended the show saying he was ' determined to fix this country one family , one entrepreneur at a time , ' with his new project ' @entity27 one			1
' he failed to say what that was exactly , but left the audience in no doubt that he 'd be back soon .			0
