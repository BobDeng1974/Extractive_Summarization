’ detective inspector @entity191 said : ‘ this is a sharp and timely reminder for people to think before they act			0
@entity3 ' actions mean he will now lose his liberty and be separated from his family			0
‘ but our thoughts are focused on @entity15 's family , who have remained dignified throughout this harrowing process of putting the life of a very private man into the public arena through no fault of his own			0
‘ they , as a family , should be celebrating a @entity206 and looking forward to 2014 without the shackles of cancer , but instead they have an empty place which can not be filled by the tragic and unnecessary death of @entity15 , a loving husband , best friend , carer , father , grandfather and a gentleman			2
‘ @entity3 was aware of his actions and the evidence against him at an early stage of this investigation but took up his right to trial , drawing out the court process and forcing @entity15 's family to publicly hear how their loved one was killed			2
