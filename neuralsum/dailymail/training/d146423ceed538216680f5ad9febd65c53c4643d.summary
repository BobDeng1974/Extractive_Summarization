by @entity0 the @entity1 truly was that for @entity3 when her waters broke during @entity5 's gig last week			1
the 28 - year - old was 39 weeks pregnant and thought she was having a small accident during the @entity5 sell out concert and stayed until the very end of the show			0
little did she know that her waters had broken at the start of the concert and her baby boy decided to make his entrance into the world right in the middle of the gig at the @entity18 in @entity19			1
new arrival : @entity3 went into labour at a @entity5 concert at the @entity18 , @entity19 , last week , pictured with new son @entity23 , daughter @entity24 , 7 , and husband @entity25 @entity3 finally realised what was going on during the fireworks finale when @entity5 's hit ' @entity1 ' was playing when she popped to the toilet			1
six hours later she gave birth to @entity31 , exactly one week earlier than her due date , in the early hours of may 29 after the gig the night before			1
@entity3 and her partner @entity25 , 29 , who works in the building industry , even considered naming him @entity35 after her daughter , seven - year - old @entity24 's favourite 1d member , @entity37			1
however , they finally settled on @entity23 after @entity25 's grandfather			0
admin assistant @entity3 said : ' i was determined to go to the concert even though i was heavily pregnant			2
i bought the tickets over a year ago for my little girl 's birthday and i was n't even expecting then			2
family : though the heavily pregnant 28 - year - old felt a little discomfort during last week 's @entity18 concert , she did n't realise her waters had broken until the fireworks finale newborn : six hours after the concert finished , she gave birth to son @entity31 , who weighed in at just over 7 lbs a few hours earlier : @entity3 with daughter @entity24 at their home in @entity57 , @entity58 before they set off to the @entity5 concert ' @entity24 was desperate to go and when i surprised her she was over the moon as they are her favourite band			1
' to be honest , i admit that i quite like @entity5 but obviously went because she is obsessed with them			0
' i felt fine on the day and even went to see the midwife who told me there was no signs of the baby being ready to come and that everything seemed normal , so i was completely shocked when i realised what was happening			0
' my partner ca n't stand @entity5 but we both actually quite liked the name @entity35			1
eventually we decided it was more sentimental to name him after @entity76 's grandad			0
welcome to the world ! @entity3 ca n't wait to be able to tell @entity23 about his dramatic arrival - she nearly named him @entity35 is he already a @entity5 fan ? @entity3 's family say that @entity23 obviously must n't have been able to stand the racket any longer so decided to enter the world ' we could have given him that as a middle name , but had already decided on @entity86			1
' @entity3 assumed that the baby was pressing on to her bladder and she had never experienced her waters breaking with her first child so was completely oblivious			2
she had no idea that her constant need for the bathroom was the beginning of her six hour labour			0
@entity3 , from @entity57 in @entity58 , said : ' my aim in the pregnancy was to get past seeing @entity5 so i feel like i 've achieved that even though @entity23 cut it very close			2
' i keep thinking that he must really like @entity5 's songs and that 's why he came early , he just wanted to be out and to listen to them and party with us			0
' the rest of my family seem to disagree and say that @entity23 obviously must n't have been able to stand the racket any longer ! ' i ca n't wait to be able to tell @entity23 about his dramatic arrival			0
i 'll definitely be making him listen to all of @entity5 's songs when he is old enough			0
' even if he does n't like them , i 'm sure his big sister will make sure that he knows all of the songs off by heart ! ' hello , brother ! @entity24 has had quite the week , seeing her favourite pop group and meeting her new baby brother			2
