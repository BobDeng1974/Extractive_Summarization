' i feel so much healthier , and i absolutely love competing - when i look back at old pictures of myself , i find it hard to believe that it 's me			1
' i 've also recently started my own personal training business to help people make a change like i did			0
' @entity4 , who once tipped the scales at almost 13st , now weighs a 8st and has dropped from a size 16 to a size six			1
the toned brunette was slim as a child growing up in her native @entity32 , but began to gain weight at university			1
she said : ' when i went to university , i stopped doing any kind of activity or exercise			1
' i 'd moved away from my family and i was just very down and lonely			0
' i was stressed due to the work load , so when i did eat it was n't anything healthy - it was chocolate and crisps - all the wrong kinds of food			2
' i was very afraid of the scales but i knew i did n't want to be in such bad shape , so i started dieting			0
' despite trying numerous fad diets @entity4 was unable to shift her excess weight ( left ) before she began working out regularly and eating a balanced diet ( right ) unfortunately , @entity4 tried all the wrong diets and was unable to shift the weight			1
she said : ' i 'd just go on the internet and see what magic diets people were talking about			2
' i tried so many crazy things - cutting out certain foods completely rather than actually eating a balanced diet			2
' it was n't until i saw a picture of myself when i went home to see my family that i just thought , " @entity62 , i need to do something "			0
' that 's when i realised that i needed to start exercising and getting my fitness up			0
' @entity4 joined a gym , began weight training , and immediately noticed a difference			1
@entity4 says she initially tried many different types of training in the gym before settling on weight training she said : ' at first i tried lots of different methods of training , but it was the weight training that i loved the most			1
' a lot of women are quite scared of weights but i thought they were great - and the fat just melted away			2
' every three months i was having to buy clothes in a smaller size			2
' soon , after chatting to people at the gym , i became interested in body composition and ways to make myself stronger			2
' it 's then that i learnt about body building			1
' i was really sceptical about it at first - i 'm quite a timid person and the idea of standing up in front of everyone in my bikini was pretty scary , but i knew it would be great motivation to get in even better shape			2
' when i told people what i was doing , they were a bit unsure about it too			0
' everyone warned me not to get too muscular , but i think i have the balance right			0
' @entity4 , who has now started her own personal training business , says women are wrong to be scared of weight - lifting and credits her training with transforming her body and her confidence @entity4 entered the bikini category for her first competition and fell in love with body building			1
she said : ' when i walked out onto the stage for the very first time it was really scary - i had so many butterflies			0
' but i was over the moon when i came fourth - i had no idea i would do so well			0
' a few months later , i entered another competition and i managed to win three trophies , it was such a buzz			0
' now i 'm starting to prepare for a huge competition next year held by the @entity123 @entity122 and @entity124 - it will be my biggest competition so far , and if i win , it will be my first major title			1
