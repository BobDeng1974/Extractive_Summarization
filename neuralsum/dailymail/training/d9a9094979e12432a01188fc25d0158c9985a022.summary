although he apologised , the argument descended into violence when mr @entity12 and his wife @entity23 , 75 , were set up on by @entity11 and her husband @entity24 , 52 , as the elderly couple tried to take staff home			1
@entity12 was left with a number of injuries from the attack including bruising to both eyes , severe facial swelling and bruising , a cut top lip and a cracked tooth @entity11 , left and @entity35 arrive at @entity36 where they admitted assaulting an elderly couple mr and mrs @entity38 were beaten during the melee before mrs @entity11 climbed into their car through the rear door where three women , including a pregnant barmaid were sitting			1
mr @entity12 was punched in the face knocking off his spectacles and hearing aid			2
he also suffered bruising to both eyes , severe facial swelling and bruising , a cut top lip and a cracked tooth			0
his wife suffered a large bruise to her left temple and other minor facial injuries while the pregnant woman sustained a three - inch scratch to her chest			1
today a judge branded the @entity60 ’ behaviour as ' disgusting ' as they admitted violence and public order offences			1
mrs @entity11 of @entity17 wept as she pleaded guilty to three counts of common assault and criminal damage and was given a 12 month community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work			1
her painter and decorator husband and another man @entity71 , 27 , a fork lift truck driver also of @entity17 , were found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and were each jailed for 18 months			0
@entity12 and @entity38 were both beaten during the melee , which also caused around £ 400 worth of damage to their car @entity18 @entity80 heard how the the incident took place in august 2013 after the wedding reception at the @entity16 in @entity17 and the @entity60 - who married in 2012 - were invited as guests			1
the court heard that mr @entity12 would often help at the events and was assisting at the function with about 100 people present			2
trouble began at about midnight as the celebrations began to wind down and mr @entity12 began to pop balloons during the clean - up as they had previously set the club alarm off			1
mrs @entity11 castigated mr @entity12 for waking up her daughter and further trouble occurred outside when the party were seen to behaving loudly			1
as the club has a sign up outside asking customers to be quiet , mrs @entity99 - who brought food to the club for her husband - politely asked the @entity60 to keep the noise down			1
but the drunken mother punched the elderly woman in the face while mr @entity110 set about the victim ’s husband punching him in the head and face , causing his nose to bleed			2
fearing they would n't stop , mr @entity12 got into the car and tried to drive off with his wife and the other members of staff inside			2
however , punches continued to reign down on the man through the open window of his car and he felt trapped as he had his seatbelt on and could not move , rendering him helpless as he was repeatedly attacked			0
one of the other women in the car got out , at which point @entity110 got into the car and assaulted the pregnant woman , pulling her hair and scratching her chest despite pleas to leave her alone because she was pregnant			1
eventually mrs @entity11 got out of the car and the police were then called			1
@entity136 , left , was sentenced to 18 months in jail for the attack , while @entity11 received a 12 month community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work a dent to the door of the car caused by @entity110 ’ tirade was estimated at £ 400 , but the loss of mr @entity12 ’ hearing aid - and the replacement - was valued at £ 3,600			1
defending @entity11 , @entity148 accepted she was drunk and behaved ‘ appallingly ’ , but said she had three children under 17 and is the sole carer for her 82 - year - old grandmother			1
but sentencing the judge mr recorder @entity152 said : ' this was a disgraceful act in which two elderly people were attacked without reason when performing an unpaid service of running a social club which had been used to host a wedding where you were all guests			2
' it must have been terrifying for them and for the three bar staff waiting to be taken home			0
' @entity166 , you started it			0
for a married woman with a child who was present looking on your behaviour was as bizarre as it was disgusting			0
i watched you sat through your husband ’s trial without showing any glimmer of emotion or embarrassment at your appalling behaviour			0
' @entity35 you were drunk and agitated			0
@entity71 you were prepared to lend yourself and involve yourself in an angry confrontation			0
@entity71 , who was also found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and was jailed for 18 months ' @entity166 you attacked an elderly woman at night in a large group and played a leading role by starting it			0
you attacked an elderly victim and you each played a significant and leading role in what was a combined attack			0
' after the hearing pc @entity194 of @entity195 said : ' the facts of this appalling case speak for themselves and serve as a sad indictment of what can happen when loutish behaviour and alcohol are mixed , becoming a violent cocktail that results in innocent , hard - working people being harmed			0
' this man is an upstanding member of the community who kindly gives up some of his free time to help out at the club			0
both he and his wife show the sort of community spirit that is to be admired , so to therefore be the victims of such sustained violence is absolutely shameful			2
' there was no provocation for what happened , no excuse or justification for attacking an elderly couple who were simply helping out at a function to such a brutal and appalling attack			0
' to add to that , a pregnant woman was also harmed despite her pleas that she was with child			2
thankfully the unborn baby was not injured but clearly the potential for serious harm was there , making this an even more cowardly and shameful act			0
' if there is any positive message to come from this sad case , it should be in the form of a warning to people attending these sorts of functions were alcohol flows freely			0
' i would hope in the cold light of day these people regret attacking two pensioners and a pregnant woman , and that if they go back they would not allow alcohol or anger to cloud their decision - making			2
