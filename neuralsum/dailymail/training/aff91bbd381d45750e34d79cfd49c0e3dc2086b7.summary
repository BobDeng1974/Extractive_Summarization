sitting alongside @entity1 in an air - conditioned annexe of @entity4 ’s stiflingly humid @entity3 in the early hours of monday morning , @entity0 spoke positively about @entity6 ’s pre-season tour of @entity7 and life under his new manager			1
during what has amounted to a five - game trial , @entity0 is one of those players who has persuaded @entity13 that he has a future at @entity15 , operating as a wing - back in the @entity18 ’s 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation			1
others have not been quite so successful , however			0
it will be presented to @entity6 chief executive @entity50 later this week , when plans will be put in place to get those who have failed to make the grade out of the door as soon as possible			1
@entity13 is not someone who likes to hang about			1
@entity57 signed : august 2013 , £ 27m from @entity58			1
league apps : 16 goals : 0 how much : @entity6 expect to take a hit and want £ 20m but will do well to get £ 15m			1
who ’s interested : @entity63 but not at the asking price			0
a subsidised loan suits them			0
@entity67 signed : june 2012 , £ 12m from @entity68			1
league apps : 38 goals : 6 how much : @entity6 will look to get around £ 8m - £ 10m			2
who ’s interested : @entity68 coach @entity72 loves @entity67			2
cash in : @entity73 and former club @entity68 are keen on @entity67 , with £ 8m - £ 10m the price @entity32 signed : january 2013 , £ 15m from @entity75			1
league apps : 2 goals : 0 how much : @entity6 would do well to raise £ 10m and may prefer to send him on loan			1
who ’s interested : @entity81 , @entity75 , @entity82 and @entity83 would risk it			0
@entity85 signed : july 2007 , £ 19m from @entity86			2
league apps : 146 goals : 25 how much : a new five - year deal raised his value last season but price will be around £ 12m			0
who ’s interested : @entity95 , @entity34 , @entity96 and @entity97 still rate the @entity98			0
@entity99 signed : july 2007 , £ 20m from @entity100			2
league apps : 104 goals : 5 how much : @entity6 are struggling to find takers even at a knockdown £ 5million			2
who ’s interested : clubs in @entity106 and @entity107 have shown interest but little else			0
down south : @entity20 could leave the club for around £ 8million , with @entity111 and @entity112 interested @entity20 signed : july 2010 , £ 6m from @entity113			2
league apps : 101 goals : 37 how much : £ 12m would be the @entity117 ’s ideal price but @entity6 expect closer to £ 8m			2
who ’s interested : @entity95 and @entity34 , @entity73 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
@entity119 ask : @entity57 has a lot to prove in a @entity6 shirt after a poor campaign under @entity123 out the door : @entity20 ( left ) and @entity67 ( right ) could be sold by new boss @entity1 @entity85 , @entity99 , @entity57 , @entity67 and @entity20 are those most under threat			1
@entity32 , whose future at @entity6 appeared bleak , is battling to win another chance at the club			1
‘ i shall make judgments after this tour , ’ said @entity13 when quizzed about his plans as @entity6 prepared to face @entity131 in the @entity133 final overnight before flying straight home			1
‘ i have let all the players play and i now know more than before the tour			2
‘ now , also , it is a little bit soon to judge , but in football you have to judge			0
you have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when i see that his prospects to play are not so high			0
you have to say it in advance , because it ’s too late after august 31			0
i will tell players after the tour but to them , not to you			2
’ @entity73 are actively pursuing @entity20 and @entity67 , who also continues to be linked with his former club @entity68			1
@entity13 admits he has too many midfielders capable of operating in the no 10 role that he has given to @entity154 , and the @entity156 star appears to be the odd man out			2
exit : @entity99 , who was on loan at @entity160 last season , is likely to leave @entity15 meanwhile , any suggestion that @entity20 had impressed his manager by scoring in saturday night ’s 3 - 1 victory over @entity30 in front of a record 109,318 fans at @entity167 , @entity168 , was quickly snuffed out by the @entity18			1
‘ i think the striker has the biggest chance to score , so that it is not the reason why a player plays , ’ said @entity13 in response to a question about the @entity22 striker			2
‘ we are playing as a team and the team scores			0
i do n’t make individual evaluations because we are playing with a team , not individual players			0
’ the form of @entity0 and @entity184 in the wing - back roles has convinced @entity13 that @entity85 is also surplus to requirements , although offloading a player who only signed a new five - year deal last september may prove a problem with interest from @entity34 and @entity95 waning this summer			1
any hope @entity99 had of persuading the new manager that the stories about his perpetual lack of fitness were untrue quickly disappeared when he went down with a calf strain two days into the initial strength and conditioning tests at @entity42 last month			0
all smiles : @entity0 ( second right ) , who seems to have impressed @entity1 , laughs with @entity200 ( left ) the @entity107 , who spent last season on loan at @entity160 , has hardly been seen since			1
@entity204 did not get off to the most auspicious of starts either			0
when the players were offered an ‘ optional ’ training session on the third day of pre-season , everyone turned up in the hope of impressing the new regime — except him			0
however , it is understood that @entity13 sees potential in converting the winger into a fourth striker if @entity20 is sold and he may give @entity204 another chance			1
of all the players whose futures at the club are in jeopardy , @entity57 can perhaps count himself as the most unfortunate			1
a much - derided symbol of the @entity123 era , the @entity223 midfielder has not even been here on tour to fight for his future			0
he only reported back from @entity43 duty last week but the decision has already been made and he will move to @entity63 if the two clubs can strike a deal			0
on a roll : @entity6 have had a successful tour of the @entity7 , and will look to carry momentum into the season @entity6 want to recoup as much as they can of the inflated £ 27.5million fee paid to @entity58 for @entity57 a year ago but at this stage , @entity63 are only interested in taking him on loan			1
offloading so many players will not concern @entity13 , who is known to prefer working with a smaller first - team squad , and he still hopes to make more signings before the end of the month			1
centre back remains a priority following the departures of @entity248 and @entity249 , with @entity68 ’s @entity250 and @entity97 ’s @entity251 the main targets			0
a new left back is required to replace @entity254 , despite the costly recruitment of @entity27 , and @entity13 would also like another midfielder			0
it has been suggested that @entity123 ’ indecision over players cost the club dear last summer , but the same certainly can not be said of his successor as @entity6 arrive home on tuesday			1
the tour is over , the decisions have been made			0
the @entity13 revolution has begun .			0

@entity0 seems to have impressed new boss @entity1
but the @entity18 could sell six of @entity6 's other players by september 2
@entity85 , @entity99 , @entity20 , @entity57 , @entity67 and @entity32 are all under the *microscope* as the @entity7 tour reaches an end
@entity13 said he will make a judgement call on the players when they return
