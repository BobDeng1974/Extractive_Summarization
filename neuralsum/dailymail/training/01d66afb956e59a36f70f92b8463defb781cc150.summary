by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob managers have a habit of talking up the opposition , especially after they have won			2
it ’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team ’s qualities			0
clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent , then that only magnifies your own achievement			0
so when @entity14 praised @entity15 at the end his 2 - 1 win over them on saturday night , the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism			1
and yet , even given that proviso , it is worth recording what he said			0
‘ we know @entity15 have changed a lot in the last few years , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ they used to play with long balls and headers			0
now @entity15 are very good playing in triangles and one on one			1
they really have one the strongest attacks in the @entity32			0
i ’ve been really consistent in what i ’ve been saying : we played against a great team			0
’ praise : @entity14 , celebrating @entity39 's win on saturday , says @entity15 are a great team perhaps he was ladling it on a little by the end			1
@entity15 are not a great side but they do have the potential to be a good one			1
it is @entity14 ’s line about @entity15 playing in triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement			1
it was n’t just about the speed of @entity15 on saturday night , which , should they progress , will surely worry any side they face			1
they actually moved the ball nicely at times , engineering their way out of tight spaces with neat passing			2
it ’s not the first time @entity15 have done it			1
foreign coaches once were similarly complementary about the improvements that @entity63 and @entity64 had made to @entity15 ’s style but progressive football was somehow abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of management			1
it seems it takes an @entity72 coach to believe @entity72 players can actually play a little : @entity74 and @entity75 never seemed to trust them to do so			0
too often at @entity15 have been like the unwanted drunken guest , stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate aggression			1
on saturday , in a @entity32 that has sparkled so far , @entity15 behaved like part of the in - crowd at the party , entertaining and impressing			1
net gains : @entity85 throws his arms in the air in celebration after scoring at the end of a free - flowing move true , they lost , a not inconsiderable draw back			2
but most would take defeat in this manner over the 0 - 0 abject draw with @entity95 in @entity96 in 2010 ; or the laboured victories over @entity98 and @entity99 in 2006			2
who would have known that @entity101 had been repressing these attacking instincts ? like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion for clubbing at the weekends , he indulged every populist call in deploying @entity107 from the start , refusing to kowtow to @entity109 and in bringing on @entity110			1
a few @entity112 fans might be bemused by the manager @entity15 have employed			1
he would argue that he did n’t have these players at @entity115			0
yet on saturday night , @entity15 seemed to play with freedom , as though they embracing the challenge rather enduring it			1
populist : @entity101 made some big calls against @entity39 and they very nearly came off not that the game was without issues			1
ultimately @entity15 ’s failure to pick up @entity123 for @entity39 ’s first goal was inexplicable in a team managed by @entity101 , who is so meticulous on his team shape and player responsibilities			1
good though @entity129 ’s dummy was , @entity123 had a free strike			0
it was a goal that was easily prevented			0
and @entity132 wo n’t relish the re-runs of @entity134 turning him the wrong way to deliver the deep , looping cross for @entity138 to score			0
and then there is @entity109			0
@entity101 defended him on saturday night and it is true that for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering a superb cross for @entity85 ’s goal			1
‘ we wanted to get @entity107 around @entity129 because of his agility and of course that meat moving @entity109 and i thought that worked well , ’ said @entity101			1
questions : uncertainty surrounds @entity109 following his patchy display against @entity39 ‘ he set up the goal for us , he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre			0
there ’s always going to be one player who there ’s a big debate around but i think it ’s very harsh to criticise @entity109 ’s performance today because for me he played well			0
’ that said , @entity85 , @entity165 and @entity107 played better			2
the debate for @entity167 now boils down to whether @entity109 is better than @entity168 ? as an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game @entity15 must win			2
however , it might be argued that @entity168 would have have dealt with full back @entity173 better and would have had the energy to offer greater protection to @entity132			0
significantly , @entity101 felt the need to switch @entity165 to the left at half time , to curtail the @entity180 right back – though he still popped up providing the pass for @entity134 ’s cross and @entity138 ’s goal			2
coming in ? @entity168 might not be a better attacking option than @entity109 but he knows the position and then there is the small matter of defeat			0
under @entity74 and @entity75 @entity15 often looked awful ; but they did n’t lose in @entity32 group stages , though @entity74 did in his first game in @entity191 to @entity192			2
@entity15 could be figuratively packing their bags on thursday , slipping out of the party before the real dancing begins , returning home after briefly dazzling			2
it does n’t feel like that , however			0
not since 1998 and the honourable exit against @entity201 on penalties has defeat felt this good			0
the national mood wo n’t feel quite so generous if the result is the same on thursday ; but if the performance is repeated , there is little chance that it will be .			0

@entity14 *insists* that @entity15 have changed their style a lot
@entity15 did *n't* just attack with speed , they also passed the ball well
@entity101 has indulged every populist call - playing @entity107 , putting @entity110 on etc
