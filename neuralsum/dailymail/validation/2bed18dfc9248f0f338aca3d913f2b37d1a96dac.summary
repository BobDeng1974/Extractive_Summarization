@entity0 is not getting carried away with his current form and admits he could be the ‘ worst goalkeeper in the world again ’ by the next game			1
the 27 - year - old put in a world class performance when @entity6 played @entity7 in the @entity8 and pulled off a string of saves to keep his side in the game			1
even though he was unable to prevent them being knocked out , the @entity7 players queued up to praise @entity0 afterwards			2
@entity0 is refusing to get caught up in his own hype despite showing excellent form with his club of late @entity6 goalkeeper @entity0 makes a save during training at @entity20 with the @entity22 squad @entity0 drew praise from @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 despite @entity6 's @entity28 exit @entity24 said : ’ he was phenomenal , he stopped everything			1
we have to congratulate him on a great game because he 's a fantastic goalkeeper			0
’ @entity25 added : ‘ @entity0 was key to keeping them in it and was great in one - on - one situations			2
’ @entity7 head coach @entity26 also said : ‘ the score could have been a rout but @entity0 was incredible			2
’ it is in stark contrast to the beginning of the season when @entity0 was dropped by city manager @entity41 and replaced by @entity42 , but he has fought his way back			1
‘ i have always been aware that for all the good stuff , i could be the worst keeper in the world again in one game ’s time , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ i do n’t get too wrapped up in good stuff or bad stuff			0
i just focus on my game and keep working hard			0
’ the @entity52 keeper says that ' for all the good stuff ' that he showed in @entity7 , his form could easily dip @entity24 tries to find a way past @entity0 but despite a dominant performance @entity7 were restricted to a single goal @entity57 attempts to nip the ball away from @entity0 's clutches at the @entity60 but again is denied @entity0 will reach a half - century of caps if he plays against @entity62 and @entity63 in @entity22 ’s next two games			1
to put that into context , @entity65 , @entity22 ’s record cap holder with 125 , was 31 years old by the time he reached that landmark			0
@entity0 added : ’ i am honoured to play every single game i have done for @entity22 and for it to be 48 so far is fantastic but i just want to keep playing			2
there are plenty of other @entity52 goalkeepers who want to do the same and i am fully aware of that			0
i have got a lot of hard work to do to keep my place and i am willing to do that			0
’ will @entity81 took over the @entity6 no 1 spot from @entity0 briefly for a spell earlier this season at the @entity85 @entity65 was 31 when he won his 50th @entity22 cap , while @entity0 could win his against @entity63 next week			1
