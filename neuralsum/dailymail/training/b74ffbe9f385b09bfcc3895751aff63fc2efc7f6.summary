overhaul : education secretary @entity1 suggested exams could be graded one to ten rather than by a * to c gcse grades could be ditched in favour of a number - based system , @entity1 suggested yesterday			1
the @entity7 said the top grades of a * and a could be replaced by classifications ranging from one to four			1
if this were applied all the way down to the lowest grade of @entity14 , pupils could end up with a score of between one and ten			2
mr @entity1 , who is overhauling @entity16 in 2015 by replacing modules with end of course exams , said the new system would help ‘ re-fix the level at which people recognise outstanding attainment ’			1
if introduced , it would end the grading system that was first used for o - levels and a-levels in 1965			1
mr @entity1 was giving evidence at an education select committee hearing when he was asked how he would avoid a ‘ collapse ’ in the number of top grades as pupils and teachers adjusted to the new exams			1
‘ the plan that ’s likely , though not definitive , is we ’d change how exams are graded , ’ he said			2
‘ so that , for the sake of argument ... you might have 1,2,3,4 cover a band of achievement that ’s currently a * and @entity46 ’ he denied planning to make it harder for pupils to get top marks after years of grade inflation , adding : ‘ it ’s not my explicit aim to reduce the number of people who receive a particular mark			0
‘ it ’s my aim to ensure , working with [ exam regulator ] @entity58 , that people can reliably feel once you have new examinations that they will keep their standards over time			0
‘ you ’re going to have new examinations and , i hope , a new approach moving on from where comparable outcomes were			0
’ change : mr @entity1 said he wants to overhaul gcses to 're - fix the level at which people recognise outstanding achievement ' however , there were doubts yesterday over whether mr @entity1 ’s proposal marked a genuine departure from the grades system			1
@entity74 , the @entity75 education select committee chairman , said the numbers would help make it clear a new system had been introduced but they were ‘ not a fundamental change ’			2
‘ given nearly everyone at the top goes on to do a-levels you could say it does n’t matter that much , ’ he added			2
@entity85 , of the @entity86 , said the plan was ‘ overcomplicated and unnecessary ’			0
‘ this is an example of exam currency being inflated , ’ he said			0
‘ they should go for a percentage mark that is readily understood by parents , employers and children			0
’ the body operating @entity97 ’s three exam boards including @entity98 last week suggested a radical overhaul of gcses by replacing grades with scores that ‘ could range from 600 - 900 ’			1
@entity103 said this would remove the ‘ arbitrary ’ categories under which pupils with similar marks can end up with different grades or those with quite different marks receive the same grade			0
an @entity58 spokesman said : ‘ we will be consulting soon on arrangements for the new gcses , and this will include a range of proposals for how they should be graded			0
’ a @entity120 spokesman said : ‘ we have consulted on a new accountability system for secondary schools and are considering how to change it			0
‘ the new more rigorous gcses will include more demanding assessment structures			0
@entity58 is considering how we can improve the current a * to g grading system			1
’ mr @entity1 also told mps he still wanted to move away from tiering in gcses , where pupils can be entered for a foundation paper with a maximum c grade or a higher paper depending on their ability .			1
