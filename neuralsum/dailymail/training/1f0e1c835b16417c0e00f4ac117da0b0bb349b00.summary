@entity11 , a 19 - year - old cheerleader for @entity13 , has received numerous threats by phone and email for her hunting hobby , including one from the model and animal rights activist , said @entity20			1

' the message has since been removed and @entity9 , 35 , has not commented on the claims			1
fight : @entity8 of @entity10 star @entity9 , pictured last week , has reportedly sent an angry @entity39 message to a teenage hunter that the girl has interpreted as a death threat @entity21 said his daughter believed the ' uneducated ' message was a death threat but has not contacted authorities because : ' we 're in @entity49 and we feel safe here			1
' @entity51 has now deleted @entity22 ' trophy photos showing the rhinos , elephants , lions and leopards that she has killed or tranquilized in @entity6			1
on thursday , @entity51 removed some of the images that violated their standards			1
in a statement , it said it removes ' reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species , the sale of animals for organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse '			0
removed : @entity51 had taken down this photo of @entity11 , 19 , with a lion that she hunted in @entity6			1
the social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards it came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging @entity51 ceo @entity81 to take down the photos in which @entity22 smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction			1
' for the sake of all animals , ' the petition against @entity22 reads as it implores animal lovers to sign , ' especially the animals in the @entity93 region ... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal ! ' after starting the social media firestorm , the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife			2
in a typo - laden defense that invokes the safari - loving 26th @entity103 president @entity102 , she claimed killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them			2
' this is a conservation effort to assure [ sic ] that they never do become extinct , ' the teen from @entity109 , @entity49 posted to @entity51			1
gone : @entity51 has also removed this image of her with an elephant			0
it said it removes ' content that promotes poaching of endangered species ... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse ' ' [ @entity102 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			0
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity129 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			0
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0

@entity22 , whose @entity51 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' said here is n't always space for threatened species like elephants or lions			1
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity22 writes			0
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			0
' ' this is a conservation effort ! ' : the @entity13 cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them @entity161 5 : @entity22 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity93 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity170 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity93 countries to kill the animals @entity22 ' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she had killed			1
one particular photo , in which she posed alongside an extremely endangered rhinoceros , had her critics especially steaming , but the @entity13 cheerleader says it was alive and well			2
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity205 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity22 has in her quest to bag the @entity93 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity170 , leopard , and @entity212 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			2
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity22 should be banned from hunting in @entity6 completely			2
pride : @entity22 learned how to hunt after she went with her father to @entity6 for his own hunts at age 9 ' cruelty ' : critics say she is not a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures boasts : ' this time i got my leopard , ' she wrote a safari when she was 14			0
' and also took down a hippo ' a second petition , this one on @entity240 and originating from @entity6 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity11 is an @entity103 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity93 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity93 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			2
' but she also has her supporters			0
a @entity51 account , @entity22 , has also started			2
' support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in @entity6 , ' reads the page			0

@entity11 , 19 , has drawn the ire of *thousands* with her @entity51 photos showing her smiling alongside rare @entity93 beasts
on friday , her father claimed that one of the threatening message she had received came from model and rights activist @entity9
but they had not reported the message - in which @entity9 said she *wanted* to ' shoot her ugly ass ' - to cops because they feel safe in @entity49
@entity51 has now removed the teen 's images of dead elephants , hippos and lions , among others , because they violate their standards
@entity22 , a cheerleader at @entity13 who is *gunning* for a *reality* show , claims her hunting is actually a conservation effort
