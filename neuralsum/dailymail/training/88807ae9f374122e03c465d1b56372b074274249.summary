by @entity0 from the surface , @entity1 does n't look like much			1
its entrance is just 12ft by 15ft wide , and so well hidden that you can not see it until you 've almost fallen in			2
but hidden below the ground is a cavern 85ft deep and 120ft wide			2
piled up on the floor underneath the opening is a 30ft deep mound of bones from extinct animals			1
and now , for the first time in more than 30 years , scientists are preparing to descent into the depths of the cave to inspect the remains , some of which are more than 100,000 years old			1
for the first time in 30 years , @entity1 in @entity20 is being opened to scientists to excavate a pile of ancient animal bones , some up to 100,000 years old , piled 30ft deep on the floor of the cavern the incredible treasure - trove of bones built up over thousands of years as unsuspecting animals fell to their deaths , unable to see the entrance until it was too late			1
among the bones at the bottom of the pit are extinct mammoths , short - faced bears , @entity36 lions and @entity36 cheetahs			1
despite the huge number of bones in the cave , scientists have ruled out the possibility that the beasts were deliberately driven there by humans , and instead think that the cave 's position along a migration route means they fell in naturally - hence the name			1
the entrance to the cave is just 12ft by 15ft wide , and is invisible until you have almost fallen in			1
thousands of animals plunged to their deaths because of this , and their bones are still down there most of the animals would have been instantly killed as they plunged into the cavern , but if they did survive the drop on to the pile of corpses below , then the low temperatures of @entity65 and high humidity of 98 per cent would have quickly finished them off			1
the cave was explored once before , in the mid 1970s , by a team from the @entity69 but in the 1980s the @entity36 @entity70 sealed over the entrance with a metal grate , and nobody has dared to venture inside since , until now			1
@entity75 paleontologist @entity74 said she has been getting ready to lead the international team of a dozen researchers and assistants by hitting the climbing gym			0
' i 'm pretty terrified , ' @entity74 admitted wednesday			0
she has n't done any real climbing before , she said , and the only way in is to rappel down			0
the only way out is an eight - story , single - rope climb all the way back up			0
even @entity70 regional paleontologist @entity85 , who is n't one to be put off by lots of animal bones , describes it as a tad creepy			2
' one can only hope that , as a researcher , you 're able to leave , ' said @entity85 , who visited the cave as a college student the last time it was open to scientists			1
' it 's an imposing hole in the ground			0
but one that actually has very important scientific value			0
' however , braving the conditions will be worth it to give scientists what may be their best look yet at the variety of critters that roamed the foothills of the @entity108 during the planet 's last glacial period , around 25,000 years ago			1
some mammal remains from the cave could be over 100,000 years old , @entity85 said			1
the remote site is exceptionally well preserved			0
a mound of dirt and rock containing layer upon layer of animal bones rises from the floor of the bell - shaped chamber			2
@entity74 believes the remains will be in good enough condition to contain snippets of genetic information			2
co-investigator @entity127 with the @entity128 for @entity129 at the @entity130 will attempt to retrieve fragments of mitochondrial dna from the bones , @entity74 said			2
entrance : 12ft by 15ft depth : 85ft width : 120ft average summer temp : @entity65 ( @entity138 ) average humidity : 98 per cent height of animal bones pile : 30ft oldest skeleton : 100,000 years old last time it was explored : 30 years ago such analysis was n't possible the last time scientists dug in the cave and could shed light on how the animals were related to their modern counterparts and each other			1
' it 's so cold all year long , that it has got just the perfect conditions for preserving @entity129 , in multiple species , in large numbers of individuals , " @entity74 said			0
' which is not really found anywhere except @entity158 and the @entity159			0
' starting monday , scientists will lower dig lights into the cave , powered by a generator on the surface , before dropping in to re-explore the cavern , dig and extract as many fossils over a two - week period as possible			1
a @entity168 grant will enable additional excavations in 2015 and 2016			0
one goal is to learn more about the @entity172 extinction , when climate change and possibly the arrival of humans in @entity176 at least 13,000 years ago wiped out dozens of species			0
the scrubby , rocky country surrounding the cave probably looks much like it did back then , though the climate may have been cooler and wetter , @entity74 said			0
the scientists will camp out nearby and venture into the cave a couple of times a day			2
ropes will haul bones up top in boxes , @entity74 said			0
' i do n't think it 's necessarily going to be easy , ' she said			0
' but i think we 're going to be pretty well prepared			0

@entity1 in @entity20 to be *reopened* for first time in 30 years
scientists will excavate skeletons from 30ft pile of bones at bottom of cave
opening to cavern can not be seen until you have almost fallen in
over thousands of years animals fell in and died , leaving remains behind
bones up to 100,000 years old and include mammoths and @entity36 lions
