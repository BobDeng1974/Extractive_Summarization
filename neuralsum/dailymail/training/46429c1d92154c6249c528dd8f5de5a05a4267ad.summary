there will be a party atmosphere at the @entity2 today but @entity3 are already in danger of becoming the noisy neighbours as they begin a new life in @entity7			1
local rivals including @entity9 and @entity10 will not be welcoming the ex-london club with open arms , with new claims of franchising , under - priced tickets and council secrecy threatening to puncture the euphoria of the occasion			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity21 , @entity9 chief executive officer @entity19 accused @entity3 , who announced their move from @entity24 in october , of showing a complete disregard for local clubs and a failure to consult relevant stakeholders			1
@entity29 crosses for a try during @entity3 ' last ever game at @entity24 in december a young @entity3 fan displays a farewell banner after @entity35 's side played their last game in @entity37 @entity3 skipper @entity38 signs autographs as his side bid farewell to their @entity24 home @entity3 director of rugby @entity35 poses for a photograph inside his team 's new home at the @entity2 @entity24 capacity : 10,516 opened : 1990 average attendance 2013/14 : 5,862 other tenants : @entity50 @entity2 capacity : 32,609 opened : 2005 other tenants : @entity54 ‘ we do n’t welcome them , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ for the likes of @entity59 and @entity60 , this has been our heartland and we really do n’t feel threatened			2
but clubs like @entity10 have had to work very hard to expand their territory for commercial benefits and could feel this very badly			1
‘ if i were @entity7 ( @entity66 ) , then i would be pretty miffed			2
i somehow do n’t think this has been done in collusion in @entity7			0
there are other local clubs like @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 — i do n’t think it ’s a very nice thing to have done on @entity3 ’ part			1
‘ we knew nothing of it until the whole situation was public			0
as a partner in a very tight group of rugby clubs , i do n’t think it was handled particularly well			2
it smacks of franchises and that ’s not where rugby is currently			0
’ shortly after the initial announcement , @entity10 voiced concerns about the damaging impact the move could have on their £ 1.5million academy investment in the region and in 2016 there will be a potential opportunity for @entity3 to move their talent catchment area to the @entity95			1
@entity96 stretches his legs during his team 's open training session at the @entity7 stadium @entity101 , the @entity3 ceo , said : ‘ it ’s up to the @entity103 how they draw the boundaries			1
there are a lot of anomalies all over the country — some clubs have huge areas and some are very small			2
we will not do anything whatsoever to put ourselves in breach of that law and we ’ll comply with that			0
the @entity103 will do what they think is best for @entity119 rugby			0
’ for now , @entity3 will continue to train in @entity37 and travel to @entity7 on match days			1
they expect an attendance of more than 27,000 for this afternoon ’s match against @entity123			0
the same fixture attracted just 7,025 at @entity24 last season			1
‘ there has been a lot of fuss about their 27,000 crowd , but that ’s not a sale of 27,000 , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ they have given most of them away for free or at heavily discounted rates			0
the key in terms of their impact in that conurbation will be a season down the line , we ’ll see what their average gates are then			2
‘ i feel sorry the @entity3 supporters who have been following their club for a number of years , because the club have just turned their back on them			1
’ @entity154 lock @entity153 ( left ) is one of the star attractions in the current @entity3 line - up wasps insist they have given away only 3,000 tickets to local schoolchildren , with the lowest - priced ticket costing £ 15			1
with almost 24,000 tickets sold in advance , the club expect ticket revenue of more than £ 500,000 for sunday ’s match			2
in the longer term , the club hopes to improve on their average attendance of little more than 6,000			2
with a casino , hotel and restaurants already in place at the @entity174 , they are optimistic they can almost triple their annual turnover to more than £ 20m			0
‘ as long as we improve on our average attendance at @entity24 then we ’re ahead , ’ said @entity101			1
‘ because of the confidential nature of the agreement we were unable to say anything to fans in the lead - up to the sale			0
the first 48 hours after the announcement was tough but since we ’ve had the opportunity to explain the decision i think most fans understand the reasoning			0
‘ it ’s sad if we lose any fans because they ’ve stuck through us through thick and thin			0
but to their credit i think they understand that if it ’s the difference between not having a club or having a club in a different place they ’d take the latter			2
local school children embrace their new club at the @entity2 during a @entity3 training session ‘ it was a case of move or die			1
it may not have happened next week , or next month but at some point in the not - too - distant future we would have faced insurmountable debts			0
‘ no one ’s going to say “ we ’d rather you went out of business ”			0
’ the @entity211 outfit are hoping to develop a new fanbase in the area , but that could have a damaging impact on @entity215 side @entity66			1
their director of rugby , @entity216 , hopes to build a working relationship with @entity3 but remains disappointed with the local council for their lack of communication over the relocation			1
‘ we had one meeting with them in october , ’ @entity216 said			0
‘ we did n’t really have much of a say — we were told they were probably going to relocate			0
if we ’ve got a beef , it ’s with @entity231			0
our beef is n’t with @entity3 and it never has been			2
the issue we had is that the council kept us completely in the dark about it			0
if this is going to work , it ’s important that we form a productive partnership			0
