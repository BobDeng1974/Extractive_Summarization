click here for grand final match report by @entity2 @entity3 apologised for the punch deemed too violent for daytime tv as he attempted to cushion the blow to his own career , @entity8 and the reputation of rugby league			1
in a display of inexplicable brutality , two minutes into the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity3 knelt over @entity15 ’ @entity16 — whom he had already knocked unconscious with a swinging punch — and landed a second , shocking blow			1
‘ there is no defence for my actions , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ it was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high			0
i instantly regretted it and am devastated that i allowed myself to punch someone like this			1
’ @entity32 's shocking attack on @entity33 in @entity11 @entity8 prop @entity3 knocked @entity15 stand - off @entity16 to the ground @entity36 international flower then followed up by landing a right hook on the stricken @entity33 @entity16 was left bruised and dazed and taken to the dressing room for treatment at @entity12 born : october 19 , 1987 , @entity40 position : prop forward / second row height : 6ft weight : 17st career 2008 – 11 @entity46 2010 @entity47 ( loan ) 2011 – @entity8 sixteen caps for @entity36 it was an inexcusable attack and few have sought to offer mitigation , beyond reiterating the intensity of the derby between @entity8 and @entity55 , two towns nine miles apart and with a fierce , long - standing rivalry			1
but the sport now faces an uncomfortable week as it decides how to punish @entity3 and limit the damage to its image			1
the incident will likely be referred to an independent disciplinary board , which will sit on tuesday , chaired by high court judge @entity63 and assisted by former players @entity65 and @entity66			0
there is no ceiling to the length of suspension @entity3 could face , with some calling for him to be banned for life			1
there is also a possibility that @entity3 could face criminal charges , despite both @entity33 and @entity15 coach @entity76 stating they did not want a prosecution			1
@entity80 @entity79 shows red card to @entity8 prop flower during saturday 's @entity11 flower walks from the @entity12 pitch after receiving a red card during the @entity86 ' i am so sorry for what happened on saturday night			1
' there is no defence for my actions			0
it was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high			0
i instantly regretted it and am devastated that i allowed myself to punch someone like this			1
' at @entity8 we are known for being aggressive but we are constantly told to do this within the rules of the game and that punching is n't tough			2
we may aim to dominate teams , but we do n't aim to hurt people			0
' i firstly offer my apologies to @entity16			2
i have full respect for him and have never gone onto a rugby field to injure a fellow player			1
i hope he is okay			0
' i 'd also like to say sorry to my team - mates , our fans and the @entity8 club			1
i know i 've let them down like never before and accept i 'll have to live with this for the rest of my career			0
' finally , i 'm sorry to the sport of rugby league			2
it was a big night and i know i 've taken the attention away from what was a special event			0
' a spokesman for @entity126 said : ‘ we will be liaising with the @entity128 , @entity15 and the @entity129 before a decision is made on what course of action is to be taken			2
’ @entity3 apologised in a carefully constructed 188 - word statement			1
on a weekend when the sport was basking in the spotlight , with no @entity137 football , he ensured the match will be remembered for a moment of madness rather than a @entity15 side who overcame adversity to win 14 - 6 and end an eight - year spell without a @entity11 triumph			1
there was a festival atmosphere before the match with both sets of supporters mingling			0
one group held up placards spelling ‘ @entity153 ’ — but @entity3 ’s punch harked back to the dark ages			1
‘ it ’s rare the sport has such a window of opportunity for publicity , falling on an international weekend , ’ said @entity156 , the editor of @entity157			0
‘ it gave rugby league the sort of profile it ’s been craving in the @entity86 era			1
the atmosphere at @entity12 was as good as it ever has been			0
then within two minutes the whole thing was turned on its head			0
’ ‘ that is almost the story of rugby league in microcosm — grasping for its opportunity but falling just short			2
it is sad that this punch will be the defining image of the 2014 season			2
i believe it was a one - off , uncharacteristic for the player and the sport			2
’ @entity16 , who watched the rest of the match from the dugout after the punch ended his game , could also face punishment for his off - the - ball shoulder charge on flower which appeared to provoke the attack			1
the @entity193 was in a forgiving mood after the game			0
‘ those things are best left on the field , ’ he said			2
‘ sometimes people do silly things that they regret			0
i am not a person who holds grudges			0
i am happy to leave that on the field and move forward			2
’ @entity3 ’s @entity8 team - mates , who fought bravely but were unable to hold on to their half - time lead , rallied in support of him			1
‘ it ’s not the image the game wants to portray , ’ said @entity207			0
saints stand - off @entity16 received medical attention after being punched by @entity3 and could play no further part ‘ he ’s punched him on the floor and @entity216 will learn from that			1
he ’ll be absolutely devastated but we ’ll all be behind him			2
he ’s a great lad , he ’s passionate , he ’s everything about the club , we love him to bits			0
’ the incident was replayed millions of times on the internet and prompted widespread national debate			0
the @entity225 decided it was too brutal to replay on its breakfast news bulletins			0
‘ i was already thinking about it on my drive into work because it ’s a great story and a “ wow ” moment , ’ said @entity229 senior producer @entity228			0
@entity15 celebrate a famous victory at @entity12 after seeing off 12 - man @entity8 with a second - half salvo ‘ the breakfast producers were talking about it when i arrived			1
they were n’t comfortable running the pictures			0
it ’s the sheer brutality of it , the guy ’s unconscious and takes one right in the face			2
’ there is little precedence in rugby league to suggest how this storyline will play out but the @entity128 are expected to work swiftly , with a decision on @entity3 ’s punishment expected in a week			1
one thing is for sure , the full impact of the punch that shocked the world is yet to be determined .			0
