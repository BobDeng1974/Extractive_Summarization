by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:13 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 18:22 est , 26 september 2012 @entity3 ’s pledge to spend billions more on foreign aid has come in for a withering attack from a sacked minister – who said he did not know a single rank - and - file conservative who backed it			1
@entity11 , a defence minister until the reshuffle , urged the prime minister to scrap the ‘ arbitrary ’ target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013 , and said it was only being imposed to mollify @entity18			1
he said it was time to ‘ reorder the priorities ’ and divert the money saved into the defence budget , warning that savage cuts to spending on the @entity25 were having a dangerous effect on @entity28 ’s influence in the world			1
the aid budget is set to rise by 32.6 per cent between 2011/12 and 2014/15 , according to the @entity31 , while the budget for the @entity33 is set for a 19.5 per cent cut			2
mr @entity11 ’s scathing criticism came as mr @entity3 made a speech to the @entity37 in @entity38 in which he promised that @entity28 would stick to its pledge , calling it ‘ morally right ’			1
the prime minister said : ‘ to those who are sceptical , i would say it is not only a moral obligation that the better - off countries have to tackle poverty in our world … but it ’s also in our interests that we build a more prosperous world			0
’ globally , @entity28 is ranked sixth in terms of aid spending as a percentage of national income , far ahead of other @entity54 nations such as @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57			1
the only countries meeting the 0.7 per cent target are @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and the @entity64			2
@entity28 is on 0.56 per cent at present , but plans to meet the target next year			2
this will see the aid budget increase from £ 7billion at the last election to £ 12billion – costing each household more than £ 300 a year			1
@entity28 contributes some of this to a @entity72 development aid budget which spends half its funds on middle and higher income nations			1
former defence minister @entity11 ( left ) urged the prime minister to scrap the target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013 , saying it was only being imposed to mollify @entity18			1
it has previously handed £ 1.8million to @entity81 to build the @entity83 hotel , where youngsters will be trained in hospitality management			0
mr @entity11 said : ‘ most people in this country will think that 0.7 per cent is a somewhat arbitrary figure , and certainly i have not yet met a conservative outside the immediate confines of the government who believes that it ’s right to ring - fence overseas aid and to cut our @entity25			1
’ he told the @entity95 that while he did not want to scrap overseas aid , he took issue with the level of spending at a time of defence cuts			2
‘ i have n’t met any rank - and - file conservative who thinks this is the right order of priorities , ’ he said			0
‘ the target is consistent with the strategy before the election which was to woo @entity109 waverers			0
i said that was mistaken politically from the outset			0
‘ it is a matter of major concern to most conservatives that we are continuing to increase our aid spending up to this entirely arbitrary limit , at the same time as a large number of countries … have refused to sign up			0
’ mr @entity11 , mp for @entity120 , said @entity28 had ‘ given leadership ’ on international aid , but the increasingly dangerous world means it was now time to ‘ reorder the priorities ’			1
mr @entity3 gives a speech to the @entity37 in @entity38 in which he promised that @entity28 would stick to its aid pledge , calling it ' morally right ' mr @entity11 told the @entity127 that cutting defence would affect @entity28 ’s influence in the world			1
he said : ‘ if you are able to carry a big stick , you can speak softly			0
and we have certainly had to trim our stick			0
‘ i believe that countries round the world do look to us and say : “ are you a serious player ? ”			0
’ @entity138 , the former @entity139 chancellor , also laid into mr @entity3 ’s 0.7 per cent target			1
‘ it is plucked from a @entity37 sponsored arrangement in 1970 , ’ he told @entity141			2
‘ it had no rhyme or reason			0
most countries now do n’t bother about it at all			0
’ but @entity149 , a ministerial aide in the @entity150 , attacked mr @entity11 ’s comments on @entity152			2
she wrote : ‘ [ @entity153 ] needs to meet a few more conservative mps			0
@entity155 at pre-budget backbench meeting was overwhelming for aid			0

@entity159 aiming to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013
this would mean a rise from £ 7billion at last election to £ 12billion
