by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 29 may 2013 for the author of one of this year ’s most talked about books , a slot at @entity5 ’s best - known literary event seemed a formality			0
but @entity8 has been dramatically snubbed by the @entity10 festival and not invited to be a speaker			1
organiser @entity12 considers his book about immigration ‘ sensationalist ’ and out of kilter with the annual event ’s liberal audience			1
in turn , mr @entity8 , director of the left - leaning @entity20 think - tank and one of the country ’s foremost liberals , accused mr @entity12 , educated at public school and @entity26 , of having an ‘ ideological spasm ’			1
anger : @entity8 , who is director of left - wing think tank demos , says he has been excluded by @entity10 organisers because they do n't agree with his new book on immigration ( right ) the writer , 56 , also criticised him for declaring the book was ‘ not very good ’ despite not having read it			1
critics have also accused organisers of suppressing free speech at the event running from last thursday to next sunday			1
at the centre of the row is the @entity43 dream : successes and @entity45 , which takes a sceptical view of large - scale immigration			0
the book , extracts of which featured in the @entity52 before its april publication , divided opinion			2
opinion : @entity56 and founder @entity12 has said @entity8 was n't invited because his book ' is n't very good ' but reviewers from across the political spectrum agreed it was an important work			1
for example , @entity61 , former chairman of the @entity62 , said : ‘ finally : a @entity65 liberal who is n’t afraid of his own shadow and a @entity43 intellectual who is n’t allergic to evidence			2
no intelligent person can afford not to read this book			2
’ so it came as a surprise to mr @entity8 when he received no interest from the festival , which attracts about 80,000 visitors to @entity76 in @entity77			1
a forthright exchange of emails followed between mr @entity12 and the author , who has attended @entity10 as a speaker or visitor for 15 years yesterday the writer told the @entity52 : ‘ i tried to persuade him to give me a slot			1
he listed various reasons he was “ wary ” of the issue			0
@entity87 was that @entity10 is “ to celebrate pluralism and multi-culturalism on a global scale – to imagine the world beyond @entity5 ”			1
‘ second , he said he did not like the “ numerical ” way the immigration debate is framed and produced an anecdote about the horrible abuse of an @entity97 asylum seeker			0
’ in an extract he adapted from his book for the @entity52 , mr @entity8 argued that among ‘ left - leaning @entity102 liberals ’ like himself there was an assumption that anybody expressing alarm at the largest influx of incomers in this nation ’s history was a racist			1
but , he said , they were wrong as mass immigration , without integration , has had a profoundly adverse effect on @entity43 democracy and social cohesion			0
popular : festival - goers browse the bookshelves on the opening day of the 2013 @entity10 last week mr @entity12			1
48 , who founded the @entity10 festival with his father @entity122 in 1988 , also referred to a 2004 article by mr @entity8			1
it was written for @entity125 and said ‘ to put it bluntly , most of us prefer our own kind ’			0
mr @entity8 went on : ‘ @entity130 was his background			1
he said , “ i ’m a second generation @entity133 from a mixed marriage and i thought your 2004 essay was unrecognisable with my experience and the experience of most people i know ”			0
‘ to be fair , he did acknowledge he was responding in a muddled and emotional way			0
he did say he would think about giving me a slot but then never got back , despite emails from me			0
‘ when it was clear he was not interested , i booked a slot at the other @entity10 [ @entity147 festival of philosophy and music ] which is where many people say the energy is now , compared to the staid main @entity10			2
’ he added : ‘ perhaps [ @entity12 ] salves his conscience by deciding against obviously suitable books that he disagrees with – a kind of ideological spasm			2
’ royal welcome : the @entity158 greets school children as she and the @entity160 arrive at the @entity10 last week			2
the couple are among 80,000 who will go this year the row was stoked when mr @entity12 told a gossip columnist this week that mr @entity8 ’s work was ‘ partial , predictable and sensationalist ’			2
he was also quoted in @entity167 newspaper saying the writer ‘ was never invited , the book is n’t very good ’			1
yesterday mr @entity8 said : ‘ he said to me he had not read the book in february			1
he may now have read some of it , though i think he probably read a short extract in the @entity52			0
‘ he is entitled to his opinion about the book but it has been endorsed by some pretty heavyweight people			0
‘ @entity12 ’s reaction is not typical of the reaction which has , in the main , been pretty sober and reasonable even on the @entity180 and shows how much healthier and more open the debate has become since 2004 when i was castigated by many			0
‘ i ’m surprised that he allows himself to overrule what would have been a good and topical book event because of his own views			1
i think that ’s very lazy thinking			0
’ accusing mr @entity12 of running the festival like a ‘ personal fiefdom ’ , he added : ‘ @entity12 does n’t like it because he does n’t agree with it but that ’s not a reason if you run a literary festival			0
‘ i ’m disappointed because i ’ve been going there for so long			0
’ the spat has spread to @entity199 , where @entity201 peer @entity200 wrote : ‘ how about some free speech at the @entity10 ? @entity203 that @entity8 told his views on migration unacceptable for debate ’			1
he also accused mr @entity12 of ‘ liberal intolerance ’			0
but mr @entity8 , a married father - of - four , who lives in @entity209 , told the @entity52 : ‘ i am not some kind of dissident ! of course , @entity12 has the right to exclude me – i also have the right to complain about it			2
a lot of people think it ’s an odd decision			0
’ mr @entity12 was yesterday at the festival and a spokesman for the event said : ‘ he has no comment at all to make			0

liberal thinker @entity8 says the snub by organisers is ideological
critics accuse @entity10 of *stifling* free speech because they do n't like his views
founder says : ' he was never invited ' because ' the book is n't very good '
