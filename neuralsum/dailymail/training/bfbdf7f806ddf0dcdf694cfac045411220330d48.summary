@entity3 ' losing web security experts ' because they ca n't match @entity1 's high salaries by @entity5 reporter last updated at 2:11 pm on 13th july 2011 @entity8 has explicitly called for ‘ cyber-jihad ’ and there have been a series of attempts by terrorists to ‘ invade ’ @entity14 , the government 's new counter-terrorism strategy said today			1
terrorists are increasingly using online technology to plan and disguise attacks and there will be more cyber-terrorism in the future , it said			2
‘ since the death of @entity24 , @entity8 has explicitly called not only for acts of lone or individual terrorism , but also for ' cyber-jihad ' , ’ it added			2
home secretary @entity29 launched the new counter-terrorism strategy which warned that since the death of @entity24 @entity8 had called for ' cyber-jihad ' the use of social networking sites and video sharing is now ‘ commonplace ’ , the strategy said			2
‘ there have been a number of attempts by terrorist and extremist groups to " invade " @entity14			2
‘ @entity41 will be used to re-post media or forum articles enabling extremist content to be shared more quickly , widely and amongst people who would not normally search for extremist content			0
’ and experts have estimated that there are already thousands of terrorist - related websites , adding : ' a few dozen are highly influential and frequented by terrorists			1
' the strategy comes the day after the @entity54 threat level from international terrorism was downgraded from severe to substantial , meaning there is still a ‘ strong possibility ’ of an attack and one may well happen without further warning '			0
warning : ' there have been a number of attempts by terrorist and extremist groups to " invade " @entity14 , ' said the government 's new counter-terrorism strategy ( file picture ) crimes linked to @entity14 reached more than 100,000 across the country in the last five years , according to a report out in december			1
callers have alerted officers to alleged acts of terrorism , sudden deaths , missing pets , sexual offences , hate crimes and even firearms offences			0
police chiefs in 16 forces received 7,545 calls from the public last year , compared to just 1,411 calls related to @entity14 to police in 2005			0
the website launched in february 2004 and now has over 750million active users			0
the government is to launch another cyber strategy later this year , funded by part of the £ 650million put aside for cyber-security under their strategic defence and security review last october			1
launching the government 's counter-terrorism strategy , home secretary @entity29 said : ‘ advances in technology mean our response must improve to keep pace			1
‘ terrorists are increasingly using online technology , including @entity101 and @entity102 , for attack planning			0
’ she went on : ‘ the marauding attacks in @entity105 in 2008 were directed by people using off - the - shelf secure communications technology to stay in contact with each other			0
‘ software to encrypt mobile phone voice and text functions is widely available and improving			0
‘ peer - to - peer networks can be used to distribute files and information rapidly and securely			0
‘ and cloud computing offers new means for storing , sharing and distributing material online			0
‘ it can be encrypted and configured to work with mobile devices , leaving little or no trace of the data behind			0
‘ and while radicalisation continues primarily to be a social process , terrorists are making more and more use of new technologies to communicate their propaganda			0
’ mrs may added : ‘ to tackle these new and emerging threats , our own technology must constantly evolve and adapt			0
’ @entity54 's top secret electronic spy agency - is struggling to retain key cyber security specialists because it can not match the wages offered by firms such as @entity138 and @entity1 , it was disclosed today			1
the parliamentary @entity139 ( @entity139 ) said it was ' concerned ' @entity3 was unable to retain a ' suitable cadre of internet specialists ' to deal with the growing threat of cyber warfare			1
in its annual report , the committee - made up of senior mps and peers - also rebuked @entity3 for losing track of equipment worth up to £ 1 million over the past 10 years			1
while it said that the majority of items attracted no security risk , @entity3 had admitted that in 5 per cent of cases - covering around 450 items - it could not guarantee that this was the case			1
' although the committee has no reason to believe national security has been compromised , the agencies must do all they can to avoid the loss of potentially sensitive equipment , ' the report said			2
' the public interest requires that @entity3 learns from the repeated mistakes of the past			1
' the report disclosed that in evidence to the committee , the @entity3 director @entity168 said he was struggling to recruit and retain the ' real internet whizzes ' he needed to counter the growing threat of cyber warfare			1
' they will be working for @entity138 or @entity1 or @entity175 or whoever			1
and i ca n't compete with their salaries , ' he said			1
' month - on - month , we are losing whizzes who 'll basically say ' i 'm sorry , i am going to take three times the salary and the car and whatever else '			2
' overall the committee expressed concern that the 11.3 per cent budget cut for the intelligence agencies - including @entity190 and @entity191 as well as @entity3 - imposed in the comprehensive spending review would affect their ability to ' maintain current levels of coverage of all aspects of the threat '			1
it warned that the situation could worsen if inflation remained at current levels and said it was ' essential ' that the spending review settlement could be reopened if there was a ' significant change in the threat '			0
the @entity139 said that @entity190 , the @entity206 , had given assurances it was able to respond to the increased terrorist threat in @entity209 , but the committee warned that in the context of declining resources , it would ' affect the service 's capability in other areas , which is a matter of concern '			2
at the same time , the committee warned that the @entity218 would ' inevitably ' lead to resources being diverted from @entity190 's other work during that period and ' thus expose the @entity54 to greater risk '			2
' the @entity222 must take such steps as are necessary to minimise the risk to the @entity54 , ' the report said .			0
