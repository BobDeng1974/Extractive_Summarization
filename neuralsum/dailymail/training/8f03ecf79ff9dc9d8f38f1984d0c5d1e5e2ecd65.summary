colonies of coyotes have already established themselves in the suburbs of @entity10			1
scientists believe other potentially dangerous wild animals , including wolves , lions and bears , may soon be following in their footsteps as they adapt to urban living			1
yesterday a mountain lion stretching over 6 - feet in size was shot dead by police officers in a residential area of @entity22 , @entity23 while roaming just blocks from an elementary school and in a man 's backyard			1
' the coyote is the test case for other animals , ' said dr @entity43 , from @entity44 , who has been tracking the wild dogs			1
' @entity46 , skunks , foxes - they ’ve already been able to penetrate the urban landscape pretty well			2
the coyote is the most recent and largest			0
the jury ’s out with what ’s going to happen with the bigger ones			0
they are going to be an even bigger challenge			0
' suburban animal : colonies of coyotes have already established themselves in the suburbs of @entity10 helping hand : rescuers try and fish the animal out of @entity64 for at least six years , one small coyote community five miles from @entity10 ’s @entity66 has remained within a territory covering just a third of a square mile			1
' that ’s an indication that they do n’t have to go far to find food and water , ' said dr @entity43			0
' they ’re finding everything they need right there , in the suburbs of @entity10			1
' he estimates that about 2,000 coyotes live in the city ’s metro area , along with nine million people in 250 municipalities			2
people living in urban areas are going to have to get used to predators on their doorstep , says dr @entity43			1
he added : ' it used to be rural areas where we would have this challenge of coexistence versus conflict with carnivores			0
in the future , and i would say currently , it ’s cities where we ’re going to have this intersection between people and carnivores			2
killed : this mountain lion stretching 6ft , 4in in size was shot and killed in a residential area of @entity22 , @entity23 on thursday morning close inspection : an officer inspects the cat that was reported seen prowling in a man 's backyard around 9.30am ' we used to think only little carnivores could live in cities , and even then we thought they could n’t really achieve large numbers			1
but we ’re finding that these animals are much more flexible than we gave them credit for and they ’re adjusting to our cities			1
' that ’s going to put the burden back on us			0
are we going to be able to adjust to them living with us or are we not going to be able to coexist ? ' earlier this year police shot dead a mountain lion after it wandered into the downtown area of a busy city			1
the large cat was found by a janitor in the courtyard of an office building near a popular open - air mall , the @entity134 , in @entity135 , @entity136 near a preschool , church and other businesses			0

he pointed out that historically , one reason people moved out of remote areas was to get away from dangerous large predators			2
' the funny thing is that now we have more people on earth and bigger cities than ever , we also now have carnivores moving into cities , ' said dr @entity43			2
' it ’s a two - way street			0
we ’re expanding cities into their territories and they ’re also coming in			0
