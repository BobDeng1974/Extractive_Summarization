missing : the painting was stolen by the @entity1 from @entity4 's @entity3 home in 1944 a multi-million pound masterpiece by 16th century artist @entity6 has been reunited with its rightful owners more than seven decades after it was stolen by the @entity8			1
@entity6 's ' a portrait of a gentleman ' had been missing ever since the @entity1 raided the collection of @entity12 banker @entity4 in 1944			1
mr @entity4 , a prominent art collector , had fled to @entity13 with his wife @entity14 six years before , when @entity15 was annexed into @entity16 as part of the @entity18 in 1938			1
the couple , who moved to @entity20 two years later , never gave up hope of finding the 50 precious works which had been stolen			0
when the war ended in 1945 , mr @entity4 set about trying to recover his collection - a hunt his heirs took up on his death in 1954			1
that determination to trace it has been rewarded after a 70 year search , when it was discovered on sale through a @entity32 art dealer last year			1
although the value of the painting 's value is unknown , the world record price for an @entity6 is Â£ 9.2million			2
but it seems the emotional reward may have been even greater			0
when they were finally reunited with the oil painting , mr @entity4 's heirs were thrilled to see it was still in the same frame it had when it was hanging above the dresser in the couple 's @entity3 dining room			1
@entity47 , co-chair of the @entity48 in @entity49 , which helped reunite the @entity50 with the painting , revealed they were ' absolutely delighted ' to get it back			0
' it was very moving when they saw it for the first time - it was still in the same frame it was in when it hung in mr @entity4 's apartment , ' she said			1
' it has taken more than 70 years to reunite the painting with its rightful owners and we are delighted for the family			0
' mr @entity4 's art collection , comprising of pieces by celebrated artists including @entity66 and @entity67 , was just one of many plundered from wealthy @entity12 on direct orders from @entity70			1
when the @entity8 were defeated in 1945 , mr @entity4 set about trying to track down the whereabouts of his stolen art. he spent the best part of a decade searching for the art , working with the @entity15 authorities to spread the word around the world			2
reunited : the painting , which hung in the dining room , pictured , is still in its original frame in 1953 , the @entity81 wrote to mr @entity4 to say his missing @entity6 painting had been sold by the @entity1 to @entity85 art brokers @entity83 , arriving in the city in 1952			1
however the dealer @entity88 refused to comply , denying all knowledge of the painting and thereby halting the investigation			2
@entity6 , better known as ' @entity6 ' , was born in 1541 in @entity92 , into a wealthy family			2
he began his career as an ' icon painter ' , and by 1563 , he was described as a ' master '			0
about four years later , he moved to @entity97 where he developed his intense , colourful mannerist style			0
he remained in the city until about 1570 , before moving to @entity100 - the heart of the art world at the time			0
here he studied the works of @entity105 and @entity106 , and continued to develop his own style			0
but it was during his time in @entity110 , in @entity111 , where he moved in 1577 , when he would produce his best works - even being commissioned by @entity113 @entity6 died in april 1614 , but his genius was not recognised until the 20th century , when his work began to be noticed by the art world			1
nowadays , an @entity6 painting can sell for millions but ms @entity47 revealed : ' it turns out @entity83 had the painting for more than 30 years and showed it worldwide with a false provenance			2
' it spent 13 years in @entity32 before going to a @entity123 private collector in 2003			0
' when mr @entity4 died in 1954 aged 84 , his family picked up the search and continued investigations into the missing artwork			2
in 2005 the @entity48 in @entity49 , a non-profit organisation which helps track down stolen art , were called into help with the search			0
a breakthrough came last year when the commission discovered the @entity6 listed for sale in a gallery in @entity85 via a @entity32 art dealer - and a claim was immediately put in for it			1
' the dealer acted admirably as soon as he realised the painting 's true history and we were able to negotiate a deal to return the painting to mr @entity4 's heirs , who now live in @entity146 , ' said ms @entity47			1
@entity147 , ceo of @entity148 , which represented the art dealer the painting was acquired from , added : ' this case proves that equitable restitution of looted works is attainable			1
' without the strength and precision of the historic claim on one side and the compliance and co-operation of the gallery on the other , this would never have been possible			0
' @entity4 was a banker and president of @entity15 petrol firm @entity164			0
he began collecting art in the 1920s , building up a notable gallery			0
the @entity48 in @entity49 , a non-profit organisation , has helped return more than 3,500 pieces of stolen artwork to their rightful owners since it launched in 1999 .			0

@entity6 's ' @entity174 ' *seized* by @entity1 from @entity3 in 1944
belonged to @entity12 *businessman* @entity4 , who fled country in 1938
one of 50 works taken from the family collection by nazis during the war
later revealed the painting had been sold to a @entity85 art dealer in 1952
but the dealer denied all knowledge - and was only *rediscovered* last year
the @entity6 has now been returned to the family in its original frame
