by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 13 february 2013 factsheet : the @entity2 has a factsheet advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes			1
but experts have desccribed the advice as ' irresponsible ' experts have condemned the @entity2 as being ‘ very irresponsible ’ for advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes			1
the astonishing suggestion emerged just days after a baby boy had his finger bitten off by a fox that attempted to drag him out the door of his home			2
the @entity2 guidance offers ‘ cheese , boiled potatoes , raw chicken pieces , bread and table scraps ’ as suitable foods in answer to the query ‘ how can i help foxes living in the area ? ’			1
it adds that providing food ‘ could help and even give you a chance to watch them ’			1
the leaflet , entitled ‘ living with foxes ’ , and designed to be printed off the internet , recommends ear plugs for residents who are tired of hearing foxes shrieking in mating season			1
it also includes a section about how to deter foxes			2
the suggestion to provide food appears very different from comments by the charity after the attack on five - week - old @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53			1
a male fox tried to snatch him away by dragging him out of the door by his hand			2
his mother @entity58 fought the animal off and doctors had to reattach his left ring finger after the fox bit it off in the attack last week			1
on sunday , the @entity2 appeared to discourage feeding , saying : ‘ it ’s extremely unusual for foxes to attack young children or anyone			1
‘ it ’s not typical fox behaviour at all			2
foxes will come closer to a house if there are food sources			2
then they can become quite bold , but they usually do back off and run away when there ’s people around			0
’ however , the leaflet continues to be available online			0
last night , pest control expert @entity76 warned : ‘ if you feed foxes , they will be encouraged to go into people ’s homes in search of more food			2
you should n’t feed foxes in your garden			0
‘ they will come closer and closer to get food			0
when your novelty of feeding them wears off , that ’s when they will start entering houses			0
‘ the @entity2 are very irresponsible for issuing this advice			1
advice : the leaflet , entitled ' living with foxes ' , encourages residents to wear to wear earplugs to avoid hearing foxes shrieking in mating season ‘ people are encouraged to feed them and you see people feeding them out of their hands in their lounges			1
but foxes are wild animals and they will stay wild animals			0
if you want to feed wild animals , go to the zoo			0
’ mr @entity76 said fortnightly rubbish collections were responsible for swelling fox numbers in populated areas			0
‘ councils should be cleaning the streets and getting rid of rubbish			0
that ’s the only way to prevent the numbers growing , ’ he said			0
@entity122 chief executive @entity121 said foxes coming into homes is a problem people have created			0
he said : ‘ you will get one fox and two or three people are putting food out , even trying to get it to take from their hand , and the fox gets used to people and will stray into properties if it thinks there ’s food			2
‘ it ’s a problem we humans have created , it ’s not the fox ’s doing			0
’ injured : the advice is still available despite an attack on five - week - old @entity51 the @entity2 has recently come under increasing criticism for its seeming transition from an animal welfare organisation to a political organisation intent on prosecuting fox hunting			1
last night the @entity2 said : ‘ we would encourage people to use humane deterrents and to make sure there is no food source available if foxes are coming into their gardens and they are concerned			1
‘ the factsheet referred to makes it clear that the most humane and long - term solution is to discourage foxes from your garden by removing or preventing access to what attracts them – however some people are determined to feed wild animals in their garden			0
‘ as stated in the factsheet the @entity2 often get asked about foxes , including what food they eat , as well as what risks foxes pose or how they can be deterred from gardens			1
the factsheet deals with each of these issues			0
‘ to be clear , the @entity2 does not encourage or endorse the feeding of foxes			1

@entity2 leaflet ' living with foxes ' is designed to be printed off the internet
it says that providing food to foxes ' could give you a chance to watch them '
the advice is available despite a fox attack on a baby in @entity52 this week
experts have condemned the @entity2 as ' very irresponsible '
