by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:10 est , 12 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:12 est , 12 december 2013 bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation , new research suggests bisexual women have more health problems than people of any other sexual orientation , new research suggests			1
compared to heterosexual people , bisexual men and homosexual people , bisexual women have more mental health problems , poorer general health and more sexually transmitted diseases , the researchers found			1
however , the quality of life of gay and bisexual people - when compared with heterosexual people - has improved dramatically during the last decade			1
the research was commissioned by the @entity26			2
‘ the similarities are greater than the differences regarding quality of life			2
that suggests that the world is moving forward , ’ said dr @entity27 , one of the researchers behind the study			2
‘ the previous @entity37 report on quality of life from 1999 presented a dismal picture			1
’ the study revealed that the quality of life of gay and bisexual people is now similar to that of heterosexual people			2
however , some bisexual women experience a lower quality of life than the rest			2
‘ we see signs of marginalisation and minority stress in a small group			0
this group has more mental health problems , poorer self - rated health , more sexually transmitted diseases , experiences loneliness and includes several suicide attempts			1
this applies to a minority , but it ’s serious , ’ said dr @entity27			0
the survey not only revealed that bisexual women are more likely to suffer chronic illness , but it also showed that many bisexual men and women hide their sexual orientation at work			1
it showed that some 78 per cent of bisexual men and 68 per cent of bisexual women do not reveal their sexual orientation to their colleagues			1
in contrast , only 18 per cent of gay men and nine per cent of gay women keep their sexuality under wraps at work			1
‘ the fact that some are struggling is related to the attitudes of those around them			0
perhaps there ’s little room in our culture for people who do n’t want to call themselves heterosexuals , gays or lesbians			0
have we reached our limit of tolerance by accepting gays and lesbians , but then that ’s enough ? ’ asked dr @entity27			0
compared to heterosexual people , bisexual men and homosexual people , bisexual women have more mental health problems , poorer general health and more sexually transmitted diseases , the researchers found she added : ‘ it ’s not the case that it ’s up to the individual to come out , this is a responsibility we all share			1
’ shockingly , the report also showed that 16 per cent of the men in @entity37 would move away from a gay man on the bus			1
dr @entity27 said : ‘ i ’ve been out as a lesbian since i was 28 , and i ’ve felt good about it			0
but i ’m used to it being an issue , and that people form opinions when i talk about my girlfriends			0
‘ the 16 per cent who would move away is less than before , but still enough to make you unsure of people ’s reactions if you come out			0
but we have to be pleased that there ’s progress			0
’ dr @entity27 worked on the report entitled ‘ @entity124 and @entity125 ’ with @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 .			0

these women are more likely to have mental health problems , @entity133 and chronic illnesses , say @entity37 researchers
bisexual men and women are much less likely than gay men and women to be open about their sexuality with their work colleagues
