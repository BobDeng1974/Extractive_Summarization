the @entity35 leadership has been under growing pressure in recent months to make it clear they would be willing to campaign for a @entity17 exit from the @entity13 if other countries refuse to hand back significant powers			1
last year , @entity42 promised that if he remains in @entity43 after the next election he will seek to renegotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship with the @entity13 before holding an in / out referendum on membership by 2017			0

the chancellor suggested the @entity17 people would turn their backs on the @entity13 unless other countries agreed to reform			1
’ the biggest economic risk facing @entity4 comes from ‘ a failure to reform and renegotiate ’ , he said			2
‘ it is the status quo which condemns the people of @entity4 to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline			0
and so there is a simple choice for @entity4 : reform or decline			0
’ mr @entity3 said it was already clear that @entity4 faced a ‘ competitiveness problem ’ before the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009			0
