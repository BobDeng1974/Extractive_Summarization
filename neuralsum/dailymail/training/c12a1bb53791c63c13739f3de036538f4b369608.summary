the grieving family of @entity4 , pictured with her husband @entity18 , were forced to pay nearly £ 1,000 for the great - grandmother to be buried next to her husband because she had moved less than a mile down the road when mr @entity21 died the couple - who had been married for 34 years - were living in @entity23 , which was within the @entity25 boundary			1
however , mrs @entity4 was unable to bear living in the house she had shared with her husband for eight years , so moved less than a mile away to @entity28 , @entity10 , in 2006			1
penpushers at @entity25 have said her burial fee would be £ 1,416 because the pensioner had become a @entity33 resident			0
the family found out if she had stayed 0.9 miles away in the @entity9 borough , the cost would have been just £ 520			2
mrs @entity4 's granddaughter @entity37 , 30 , who lives in @entity38 , @entity10 , accused the council of ' grave robbing '			1
' the funeral directors told us the graveyard in @entity25 was nearly £ 1,500 because she did n't live there anymore			0
' when she bought the grave she bought a triple plot so she could be buried next to her husband			0
' we were absolutely gob - smacked when we found out			0
it feels like 21st - century grave robbing			2
the map shows the distance @entity4 moved after buying the burial plot at @entity8 ' my nan had lived in @entity9 borough for eight years before she moved , but apparently that is n't long enough			1
' the council are saying because she has n't paid council taxes there for eight years we have to pay that much more			0
' we just could n't understand why a job that is being done by the same people and using the same equipment has an £ 896 price difference depending on where in @entity10 you live			0
' my nan moved because she did n't want to live in that house on her own and she wanted a fresh start but she did n't want to move out of the area			0
' she only moved just down the road and she walked to the cemetery every day to visit my grandad 's grave and look after it			0
' mrs @entity4 passed away on december 12 after a short battle with secondary liver cancer			2
her daughter @entity76 , 47 , who lives in @entity28 , added : ' when they told us how much it was going to cost we just sat there dumb - founded			2
' it was a hard enough time anyway , having just lost my mum , so to be told that we 'd have to fork out all that money was a kick in the teeth			0
mrs @entity4 bought the plot at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , in 2001 after the death of her husband the council said ' we ' we offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough 's cemeteries ' ' she moved less than a mile away , but the fact she 'd moved to a different council area was n't something she 'd ever thought about			1
' we 've paid the extra money as that 's where she wanted to be buried , but it felt like we had no choice			0
' the grandmother - of - four , who also had seven great - grandchildren , had left some money to pay for her funeral but it was n't enough to cover the extra cost of digging the grave			1
the family have now had to cut back for the service , which is taking place on december 30 , to ensure the widow can be buried next to her husband who worked as a gas man			0
a spokesman for @entity25 said : ' we offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough 's cemeteries			1
' while we understand the family 's frustration , the eight years when the person lived in the borough was not long enough to have a long - term connection to the area			2

great - grandmother @entity4 bought the plot in @entity8 in 2001
when she died , aged 72 , her family were told to pay nearly £ 1,000 extra
