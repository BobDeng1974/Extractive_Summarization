by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 07:01 est , 13 march 2012 when his son was diagnosed with a rare medical condition that attacked his kidneys , @entity5 , 51 , did n't think twice about donating one of his own			1
but his grateful 10 - year - old son @entity7 has nicknamed him ' superdad ' as a result			1
' i do n’t think of that , it was a privilege , an honour , it ’s the least i could have done , ' mr @entity5 said			2
' but he does appreciate it			2
when he takes his medication he is doing it for me in a way , he knows he has to look after the kidney			2
' recovery : @entity18 and his father @entity19 at @entity20 after the kidney transplant mr @entity22 and his wife @entity23 , 35 , from @entity24 , took @entity7 to the doctors in february 2011 after he began feeling unwell			1
he was originally diagnosed with a stomach bug and later with gastritis			0
but as his condition continued to worsen over the next few days , he was rushed to hospital			1
doctors consulted @entity20 ( @entity20 ) with the then nine year - old ’s alarming test results			1
his ' creatinine ' level , a way of measuring kidney function , was exceedingly high - the average level for a child is 30 - 57 micromoles per litre and @entity7 ’s was 1,044 - showing his kidneys were not filtering his blood			1
' they just put him in an ambulance - we live 70 miles from @entity43 and they drove him all the way there on blue lights , ' mr @entity22 said			2
surgery : @entity7 , 10 , suffered total kidney failure after his immune system attacked those organs close bond : @entity52 ( left ) said it was a privilege to donate a kidney to his son at @entity57 was diagnosed with complete kidney failure , caused by the rare condition @entity60			1
the disease means the body ’s own immune system reacts against some parts of itself , creating antibodies that attack the lungs and kidneys			1
it has to be treated with immunosuppressive drugs to stop this process			0
@entity7 initially spent six weeks at @entity20 where he had three operations , 20 plasma exchanges and two blood transfusions			1
even when at home , he had to undergo around 11 hours of dialysis a night , his bedroom converted into a clinic completely with all the equipment and hospital - level hygiene			2
the family ’s pet basset hound @entity83 also had to be rehomed amid hygiene concerns			0
but @entity7 ’s only hope of recovery rested with a kidney transplant			1
both his mother and father volunteered as donors - deciding it should be his father who donated the organ			2
' we both put ourselves forward , he ’s our only child and it ’s just the immediate instinct you have			0
' you would do anything for that child , we both wanted to do it desperately			0
' we decided i would go first - we could n’t have the operations in the same hospital and we thought it was better if his mother was with him in the hospital			2
' you do n’t realise it but once you have been accepted and you ’re working your way through the process , you see how important that kidney is			0
' there ’s a lot of emotional and psychological pressure on you , your child is depending on you			0
' you watch him , the difficulties at home , and you know the key to a better quality of life lies in you			0
it was such a relief to actually have the operation			0
' looking forwards : both @entity7 's mother and father stepped forward to donate him a kidney			1
in the end his father had the operation the operation on november 15 was followed by an anxious six - week wait to see if it was a @entity136 a few months later , the family ’s life is starting to get back to normal - @entity7 went back to school in january and his father is back at work			1
for football - mad @entity7 , this year saw him get the chance to be the mascot at @entity143 ’s match against @entity144 on january 31			1
for his father , the simpler moments are the most rewarding - such as seeing his son go to the toilet and drink freely without any difficulties			2
' in life we take it for granted to drink when you are thirsty , we are even encouraged to do so and to go to the toilet when you feel the need to pass urine , ' he said			0
' however , for someone on a pd dialysis it is very different and often difficult			0
their lives are totally controlled by restrictions and allowances			0
' even a treat like an ice cream or the milk on your cereal the fluid is carefully measured and controlled			0
' he said @entity7 is now facing a healthy future			1
' we had a rough year but it ’s such a happy ending now , ' he said			0
the family ’s story is being told in the documentary my life : me , my @entity178 & his kidney , to be screened on @entity180 on wednesday at 4.30pm .			0

@entity7 had one - in - a - million condition that caused his body to attack his kidneys
