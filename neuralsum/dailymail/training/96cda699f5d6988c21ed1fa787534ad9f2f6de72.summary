by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:15 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 4 march 2013 burning effigy : an image of retired pope @entity4 was set alight in a church in northern @entity6 during sunday mass a catholic priest set fire to a photograph of @entity4 in the middle of sunday mass in northern @entity6			1
the now @entity14 @entity13 ' first sunday in retirement was marred by the actions of the clergyman in a petite medieval village on the border to @entity20 who accused him of deserting the church			2
father @entity22 , 67 , said the former pope was ' like the captain calamity of the @entity25 who had abandoned his ship			1
' parishioners in @entity29 , a hilltop village of 350 inhabitants , in @entity31 , were shocked when the priest set showed them a picture of the @entity34 and then set fire to it with a candle			1
father @entity22 explained his actions by saying : ' a shepherd should n’t abandon his flock			1
' @entity29 mayor , @entity42 , who was summoned to tackle the errant priest said : ' it was a shocking gesture			2
' i understand that @entity46 is going through a delicate period from a psychological point of view			0
' the local bishop said he was ‘ mortified ’ by the ' reprehensible and grave disturbance of ecclesial communion			0
he said : ' i am mortified by the actions of @entity53 , who in other respects has proved a priest who is generous and sensitive in his pastoral conduct			2
' the gesture has caused confusion among the parishioners - many left the church			0
' but @entity62 remained defiant saying he ' had done the right thing '			0
he told @entity65 : ' i had said to myself the day that he goes i will burn this			0
' while other clergy claim to found the @entity14 's retirement courageous , @entity62 insisted : ' i thought to myself , " are you the @entity14 or are you @entity25 of the @entity25 who abandoned his ship ? " ' if eight years was enough of being @entity14 , he did n't need to accept it			1
he created 90 cardinals , he was n't some novice or ingenue , who did n't know what they were getting into			0
' meanwhile in the @entity80 , cardinals from around the globe received a ' rock star ' welcome as they gathered for the first round of meetings before the conclave to elect the next pope			1
fiery temper : a priest in the picturesque mountain village of @entity29 in @entity31 , north - west @entity6 , held up a photo of the former pope and set fire to it with a candle high greeting : @entity6 cardinal @entity95 waves to the crowds and the media as he arrives for the first meeting at the @entity80 this morning time to choose : cardinals @entity100 , center , and cardinal chamberlain @entity102 , right , head opening talks ahead of a conclave to elect a new pope in the @entity80 today huge crowds and media crews forced the cardinals and and their aides to push their way through the masses when they arrived this morning to set the date for the papal conclave			1
' a @entity116 pope is possible , everything is possible ! " said @entity119 cardinal @entity118 as he entered			0
the core agenda item is to set the date for the conclave and set in place procedures to prepare for it , including closing the @entity125 to visitors and getting the @entity80 hotel cleared out and de-bugged , lest anyone try to listen in on the secret conversations of the cardinals			1
although the main item on the agenda is setting the date , a final day may not come today as the dean of the @entity135 , cardinal @entity100 , has said the date wo n't be finalized until all cardinals have arrived in @entity138			1
the meeting will also cover the time table for procedures preparing for the election , including closing the @entity125 to visitors and getting the @entity80 hotel cleared out and de-bugged , lest anyone try to listen in on the secret conversations of the cardinals			0
the first day of the cardinal 's meeting has already been marred in scandal with this weekend 's shock resignation of @entity151			0
leader : pope @entity4 's last weekly public audience in @entity155 in @entity80 attracted record crowds to hear his final words before he stepped down on thursday @entity159 's most senior @entity158 admitted on sunday that his ‘ sexual conduct ’ had ‘ fallen below the standards expected of a priest , archbishop and cardinal ’			1
the 74 - year - old former archbishop will face a @entity80 investigation into his behaviour and could be subjected to further punishment if evidence of wrongdoing is found			0
in @entity6 , the @entity80 is still reeling from the fallout of the scandal over leaked papal documents , and the investigation by three cardinals into who was behind it			1
@entity6 news reports have been rife with unsourced reports about the contents of the cardinals ' dossier			2
even if the reports are false , as the @entity80 maintains , the leaks themselves confirmed a fairly high level of dysfunction within the @entity80 bureaucracy , with intrigues , turf battles and allegations of corruption , nepotism and cronyism at the highest levels of the church hierarchy			0
in one of his last audiences before resigning , @entity4 met with the three cardinals who prepared the report and decided that their dossier would remain secret			2
but he gave them the go - ahead to answer cardinals ' questions about its contents .			0
