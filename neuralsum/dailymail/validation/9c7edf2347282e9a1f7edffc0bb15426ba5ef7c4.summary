five hundred to one was the price quoted to optimistic punters who felt @entity3 had it in him to become the @entity6 's top scorer at the beginning of the season			2
that 's not looking such a gamble now			0
nineteen goals later during one of the most breathtaking and honest seasons in recent memory , he 's level with @entity16			1
@entity3 is with @entity19 's @entity18 squad this week and can lay claim to being the country 's only genuinely complete frontman			1
@entity23 down to see a full breakdown of @entity3 's 19 goals @entity3 - pictured scoring against @entity27 on saturday - has netted 19 times this season @entity3 is training with the @entity18 team at @entity30 for the first time this week @entity3 's goals have come from a variety of angles in what has been a staggering season for @entity37 graphics were provided by @entity39			1
his international team - mates who share @entity30 with him in the coming days will doubtless notice the 21 - year - old 's range of ability			0
@entity3 is as comfortable 25 yards from goal as he is in the penalty area – and the visuals of his stunning campaign tell the whole story			2
predominantly right - footed , it 's little wonder that 10 of his strikers have come that way , but @entity53 – and now @entity19 – will be enthused at the other ways in which he finds the net			0
@entity3 's spike of goals came around @entity58 and he has added more headers and left - footed strikes recently @entity3 ( celebrating scoring against @entity62 in november ) has been in stunning form for @entity37 @entity64 had no chance after @entity3 's free - kick swerved beyond him at @entity67 four have come via his head , with five slammed home with his weaker left peg			1
nine goals have been netted from more than 12 yards out			0
those include a 29 - yard hit in the 5 - 3 win against @entity75 on @entity76 , and that stunning swerving free - kick at @entity62 earlier in november			0
compare that to @entity79 , who has 11 for the season - nine of which came with his favoured right			0
his goals have contributed 22 points to @entity37 charge towards the top four , too			2
@entity3 's rise to prominence has been staggering and , with five goals in his last three , is in prime position to pip the injured @entity16 and send the bookies into a sulk .			1

@entity3 is level with @entity75 's @entity16 on 19 goals
the @entity37 striker is training with @entity18 for the first time this week
