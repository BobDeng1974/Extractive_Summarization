@entity0 had to dig deep in a tough first set before the world no 1 eventually eased over the finish line to progress to the third round of the @entity5			1
@entity0 saved three set points against world no 203 @entity8 in the first set before battling back for a 7 - 5 , 6 - 0 victory			1
@entity8 , a former world no 2 from @entity12 , has been plagued by injury in recent years and now sits at a lowly ranking after playing just five tournaments last year			2
@entity0 went from agony to ecstasy as she battled past @entity8 to reach the third round @entity0 looked set to lose the opening set but she fought back well before running away with the second but @entity0 made a sluggish start and appeared to struggle to serve into the sun as she went 5 - 3 down in the opening set			1
however , 33 - year - old @entity0 showed her fighting qualities and saved three set points as she reeled off four games in a row to take the opening set in 58 minutes			1
@entity8 never recovered and failed to win another game as @entity0 dominated to wrap up the match in one hour and 25 minutes			1
@entity0 said : ' she started out really well			2
she was really agressive and i was a little bit too passive			0
' once i got down , i said " @entity0 , you have nothing to lose here , enjoy yourself " and i started to play better			1
' earlier , sister @entity35 also reached the last 32 as the 34 - year - old beat compatriot @entity36 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 in one hour and 16 minutes			1
it is the 12th time @entity35 has progressed to the third round at @entity39 , though she has never won the title here , with her best performance being an appearance in the 2003 final against @entity0			1
the earliest the two sisters can meet this year is in the semi-finals , although @entity35 will do well to get there considering she has a tricky encounter against feisty @entity49 @entity48 next and a potential last - 16 clash with no 6 seed @entity52			1
@entity8 failed to close out the first set and was blown away in the second as she crashed out in @entity39 @entity35 will not be content , though , unless she leaves @entity39 a week on sunday with the trophy in her hands			1
she said : ' for me , i 've won in my life			0
i 've won a lot of things			0
for me it 's about titles , so no matter what the title is for me , [ getting ] to the finals is the same thing as the third round if i did n't win			2
' for me , it 's about hopefully trying to take titles home			0
last year i got in the circle to hopefully [ win ] titles quite a few times and sometimes came up short			0
' that 's pretty much where i want to be			0
my focus really is how close can i get myself to be in that winner 's circle			0
' @entity35 's resurgence - which included victory at the @entity81 two weeks ago - after being hindered by illness and injury in recent years - has also acted as motivation for her younger sibling			1
@entity0 said : ' she is really motivating			2
she is playing so well , she 's doing so good right now			0
it makes me look behind my shoulders and i have to play better and i want to do better			0
' i always want to be able to stay ahead as much as i can			0
so i think that 's been , for our whole careers , we 've kind of motivated each other			0
we hopefully continue to do that			0
' @entity92 also reached the third round in @entity39 with a straight - sets win over @entity36			2

@entity0 looked set to lose the opening set to @entity8
but the @entity98 fought back well to win it 7 - 5
@entity0 then *cruised* through the second without losing a game
she *joined* her sister @entity35 in the third round after her earlier victory
