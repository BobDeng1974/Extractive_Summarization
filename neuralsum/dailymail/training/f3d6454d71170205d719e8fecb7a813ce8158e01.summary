preparing the garden for winter is something we all have to do - usually as a reluctant activity one sunday afternoon - but for workers at @entity7 's oldest and largest topiary it is a mammoth six - month job			1
by this time of year the usually perfectly sculpted shapes of the trees and bushes at @entity11 in the @entity12 are starting to look a little fuzzy round the edges			1
and it takes a team of four men and their shears until february to complete the ten - acre garden 's annual haircut			1
time for a snip : the ten acres of topiary gardens at @entity11 in the @entity12 require a six - month tidy up every autumn to keep them looking perfect getting to work : head gardener @entity24 , 52 , has worked at the gardens for 27 years and lives in the house that was built for the first head gardener 300 years ago all shapes and sizes : @entity11 houses @entity7 's oldest and largest topiary gardens , as most were town down in the 1730s after going out of fashion @entity34 at the topiary , @entity24 , said : ' it is certainly a big job			1
we usually kick off around now , and then hope to finish by @entity39 , although the snow can hold us back - and it 's usually february when we finally put down our shears			2
' by late august the bushes and trees are starting to look untidy , but you have to be careful not to start clipping too early			0
if you do that then you are in danger of having to do the mammoth job twice a year			2
' the topiary at @entity11 , which dates back to the 17th century , is unique as it is the only one which has survived the shifting fashion in gardening			1
@entity55 problem : the team of four gardeners hopes to be finished by @entity39 , but snowy weather can often hamper their efforts and take the project into february gardening heights : the gardeners use many of the same methods utilised back in the 17th century , though hydraulic lifts are often used instead of ladders stroke of luck : it is only by chance that this topiary survives , as the family which owned @entity11 had a second home which they were more fashion - conscious about , and therefore did not mind this garden falling behind in terms of style the first seeds were sown in the 1690s - a time mr @entity24 , 52 , describes as the golden age of topiary gardens			1
but not long after , in the 1730s , landscaping became more popular and many of the gardens were ripped out			0
mr @entity24 , who lives within the grounds of @entity11 in a house that was built for the very first head gardener more than 300 years ago , added : ' the reason why this topiary has remained was partly due to the fact that the family had a second house			1
' they were more fashion conscious when it came to that home , and the topiary at @entity98 was allowed to remain			0
it was a much - loved garden by the family , and a quirk of chance has meant it remained			2
' the garden was started by @entity105 @entity104 when the house was sold to colonel @entity108 - @entity107 to @entity109 the way in which the garden is maintained has changed little in its 324 - year history			1
variety : the shapes are made from small - leaved evergreens @entity116 , @entity117 ' and various forms of @entity120 sempervirens timing is key : it is important the gardeners do not start work on the topiary too early , otherwise it will need to be trimmed twice the following year shears and clippers are still used to trim the trees into shape , although a hydraulic lift has replaced the ladders that were once needed to reach the tops of the highest			1
mr @entity24 , who has worked at the topiary for 27 years , said : ' one of the things that is so special about this job is the continuity			0
the tidying up of the topiary has taken place every single year for the past 300 years			2
' it makes you feel connected to the gardeners of the past			0
the topiary is much the same as it always has been , it is mainly the flowers underneath the trees that change			0
' the way in which visitors enter the garden is quite unusual , through a small side door			0
' this then opens up into an amazing and magical scene			0
i am lucky enough to work here every day , but for visitors , it is a spectacular sight			0
' the shapes in the topiary are made from tight - growing , small - leaved evergreens @entity116 , @entity117 ' and various forms of @entity120 sempervirens			1
the garden at @entity11 is open to public between april and october			2
it closes this year on october 9 .			0

@entity11 in the @entity12 *undergoes* mammoth trim at the end of every *summer* to prepare for winter
a team of four gardeners work until february to tidy up the shapes at the 324 - year - old topiary garden
