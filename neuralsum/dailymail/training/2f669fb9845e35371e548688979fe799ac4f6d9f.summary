by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 03:27 est , 6 december 2012 a record 4.5million workers could be paying higher - rate tax by the end of this @entity4			1
the number in the 40 per cent band is expected to rise from 3.8million today by another 400,000 over the next three years , the @entity5 said yesterday			0
however , experts predicted the number dragged into the higher rate could be an additional 300,000 – which would in total account for nearly one in six taxpayers			2
' it seems a bit unfair ' : civil servant @entity16 with wife @entity17 and sons @entity19 , nine , and @entity20 , six ( see @entity21 ) @entity16 , 39 , is a civil servant edging perilously closer to becoming a higher - rate taxpayer			1
the father of two from @entity25 , @entity26 , earns £ 39,700 as a project manager with the @entity28			0
he expects that salary to increase in line with inflation , about 2.6 per cent , but with the higher tax rate threshold increasing by just 1 per cent to £ 41,685 – behind the inflation rate – he looks certain to pass it within a year or two			1
mr @entity16 said that he and his wife @entity17 , 39 , who earns £ 7,000 a year as a part - time office manager , will be paying more tax without actually being better off			1
he said : ‘ if we were both earning more than £ 40,000 i would say fair enough			0
but considering it ’s only me , i do n’t think we should be in the higher tax rate category			1
it seems a bit unfair			0
’ yesterday , the chancellor announced that the point at which workers start paying higher - rate tax was to increase by one per cent a year			1
but as this increase is likely to lag behind pay rises , this will push anyone just below the limit today into the higher band			2
@entity53 , of accountancy giant @entity54 , said : ‘ the chancellor ’s move will drag many more hard workers into a higher - rate tax band , most of whom will not consider themselves wealthy by a long shot			1
every year the starting point for 40 per cent tax keeps being pushed down			2
’ in the hope of raising £ 3.3billion by 2018 , mr @entity64 announced he would limit the size of the increase in the personal tax thresholds			1
currently , everyone can earn £ 8,105 without paying a penny of tax			2
for the next £ 34,370 they earn they pay income tax of 20 per cent			0
this means that once they have a salary of £ 42,475 , they would pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound they earn			0
normally , these limits rise in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living			0
however , by raising the point at which higher rate is paid by a flat 1 per cent instead , which will happen for two years from 2014 , more workers will be dragged into this 40 per cent band			1
next year , the point at which this starts will be £ 41,450			0
the reason for this initial drop is to stop wealthier taxpayers receiving an increase in the amount of income they can earn tax - free			2
in 2014 the 40 per cent band will start at £ 41,865 and then will again rise in 2015 , to £ 42,285			0
the highest previous number of higher - rate taxpayers was 3.87million under the @entity105 government in 2007 - 2008			1
at the start of this @entity4 there were 3million			2
money , money , money : chancellor @entity64 left , walks with chief secretary to the treasury , @entity112 , as he leaves the @entity5 to deliver today 's @entity113 the @entity5 ’s own figures estimate there could be another 600,000 on top of the current 3.8million by april 2014			1
this increase will raise £ 295million , and then £ 875million by april 2016 and £ 1.1billion after that			0
the higher tax bills will hit families struggling to pay off mortgages and grappling with rocketing fuel bills and punitive petrol prices			2
earlier this year , research for the @entity126 showed the higher - rate tax trap was hammering those earning ‘ relatively modest ’ salaries			1
it also highlighted the huge rise in the percentage of all taxpayers caught in the 40 per cent tax net			0
in 1978 , the net ensnared three per cent of taxpayers , and edged up to five per cent by the late 1980s			0
but it has more than doubled to 12.5 per cent today , and is estimated to be 15 per cent next year			0
at present , there are 29.7million taxpayers in @entity140			0
of the total , 4.1million , which is equal to 13.8 per cent , are either higher - rate or ‘ additional ’ 50 per cent taxpayers .			1

a record 4.5million could be paying the higher tax rate by the end of this @entity4
chancellor @entity64 announced that the point at which workers start paying higher - rate tax was to increase by one per cent a year .
