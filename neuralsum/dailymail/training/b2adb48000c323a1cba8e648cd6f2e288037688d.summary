at first glance , it looks like a @entity2			0
at second glance , it still looks like a @entity2			0
even on third and fourth glances , you would be forgiven for thinking the car was indeed an example of a great @entity10 brand , manufactured in the @entity11 and costing around £ 40,000			1
but walk around to the front , and you ’d realise something was awry			0
for emblazoned across its bonnet are not the words ‘ @entity2 ’ , but rather , ‘ @entity18 ’			0
the real thing : a @entity20 manufactured and sold in @entity10 for around £ 40,000 fake : the @entity21 sold in @entity22 for £ 26,000 , a fraction of the price of the @entity10 brand 's models a @entity21 , to be precise — as proudly displayed at @entity22 ’s recent @entity28 motor show			1
manufactured in @entity22 , the @entity21 is , to all intents and purposes , a carbon copy of the @entity20 — but , at £ 14,000 , is £ 26,000 cheaper			1
unsurprisingly , the chief executive officer of @entity33 is livid that one of his flagship vehicles has been ripped - off so flagrantly			0
‘ the fact that this kind of copying is ongoing in @entity22 is very disappointing , ’ thundered dr @entity36 to @entity37			1
‘ the simple principle is that it is not something that should happen — the @entity44 is owned by @entity33			0
’ however , as dr @entity36 well knows , his @entity2 , which is promoted by no less than @entity45 , is not the first @entity10 vehicle to be copied by the @entity22 — and it will certainly not be the last			1
over the past few years , @entity22 motor manufacturers have been producing scores of ‘ fake ’ @entity10 cars — from phoney @entity51 to copies of @entity53			1
and it ’s not just our cars the @entity22 are ripping off			1
for if you name any @entity10 luxury brand , you can bet your bottom yuan that somewhere in @entity22 will be a factory producing cheap and shoddy copies			1
@entity62 : the @entity63 in silver , manufactured and sold in @entity10 for £ 250,000 fake : the @entity65 in @entity22			1
the vehicle is £ 220,000 cheaper than the @entity63 at just £ 30,000 not only that , but the products are being exported back to the @entity68 and sold here online or on dodgy market stalls			1
fancy a @entity71 handbag ? you can get one for £ 20 from @entity22 , compared with the real thing at the @entity71 boutique on @entity75 , where prices start at £ 1,100			1
a pair of @entity79 heels ? yours from @entity22 for £ 15			1
but you ’d be lucky to get much change from £ 120 for the genuine article			0
and it ’s not just these upmarket brands the @entity22 are pirating			1
@entity86 names such as menswear chain @entity87 are also being ripped off on @entity22 sewing machines			1
and if you ’re a smoker , then there ’s a good chance your packet of @entity93 started life behind the @entity95 and not in @entity96			0
why are the @entity22 doing it , and how are they getting away with it ? the reason why they are making clones is simple — they are cheap , and therefore affordable on the domestic market			1
many @entity22 consumers want desirable @entity106 and @entity107 cars such as those made by @entity33 , @entity109 and @entity110 , but their wallets are not big enough			1
these cars are open imitations and are n’t being passed off as fakes			0
and they ’re only on sale in @entity22			2
the @entity22 motor manufacturers produce these rip - offs quite openly , and , surprisingly , they do so within @entity22 law			2
the problem lies in the thorny issue of patent protection			0
in the @entity68 , inventors and designers have been protected by patents for hundreds of years , and we all understand that we can not just copy a product and then sell it			0
but in @entity22 , still emerging from some of the shackles of @entity130 , the notion of intellectual property — which includes copyright and patent — is still a relative novelty			1
‘ this is a massive , deeply ingrained problem , ’ says @entity136 , the managing partner of @entity138 - based firm @entity137 , which assists companies with intellectual property issues all over the @entity141			0
bags of cash : a genuine @entity71 handbag ( left ) , £ 4,000 , and a copy sold for £ 20 abroad ( right ) ‘ for example , when i first came to @entity138 , 15 years ago , university professors would simply sell to students photocopies they ’d made of @entity106 textbooks			1
’ mr @entity136 says that one of the problems is that @entity22 patents are surprisingly easy to obtain			2
‘ when you register a design patent in , say , the @entity157 or the @entity10 , you have to show that your design is novel , ’ he says			1
‘ the patent examiner then gives your application a thorough examination			0
but in @entity22 , they do n’t do that			2
all they do is to check that you ’ve filled in the forms correctly			0
’ so , @entity22 motor manufacturers can register the designs in @entity22 of forthcoming @entity106 cars as if they were their own			2
and , to make matters worse — and this is where things get silly — the @entity22 firms are then able to sue @entity106 manufacturers when their original cars appear on the market in @entity22			1
the obvious question is this : if registering patents in @entity22 is so easy , why then do n’t foreign manufacturers do so ? this is where things get more absurd still			2
many manufacturers such as @entity33 do register their designs with the @entity22 patent office , but it makes little difference			1
under @entity22 law , it is almost impossible for a @entity106 firm to prove to a @entity22 court a @entity22 manufacturer has infringed a patent			1
‘ there ’s definitely a ‘ home court advantage ’ , ’ says mr @entity136			0
on paper , the rules are supposed to be similar to those in @entity10			2
if , to the eye of an ordinary consumer , the products look the same , then there is an infringement			0
but in @entity22 , according to one anonymous in - house lawyer for a major @entity22 car firm : ‘ we believe that it is difficult to win a patent infringement case for an overall appearance of a car			1
’ when it comes to actual counterfeit items such as handbags and dresses , the key difference is that they , unlike the cars , are smuggled back to @entity10 , and illegally peddled in market squares of many @entity10 towns or on online auction sites			2
reputable firms such as @entity223 do their best to enforce a strict ban on fake goods and many purchasers on that site are covered by the firm ’s @entity228 if they find they have bought a knock - off			0
but some items slip through the net			0
real , a £ 95 @entity87 polo shirt ( left ) and the fake version sold in @entity22 for as little as £ 3 the other problem is that there is a huge demand in @entity10 for fakes			1
many of us can not afford to pay top whack for luxury brands , and it is very tempting to spend a few pounds rather than a small fortune on a designer @entity10 brand that will turn heads on a saturday night			1
and besides , who is really going to notice the difference ? if you ca n’t find what you want in the market or from a bloke in the pub , there is always the internet			0
@entity261 what you want , and plenty of websites will brazenly offer a counterfeit version for a fraction of the price			0
on one website it was possible to pick up a ‘ @entity269 cashmere wool coat ’ for £ 60 plus £ 30 shipping			0
although the coat is last season , the equivalent today would cost £ 2,500			0
fancy an elegant @entity274 grey handbag ? why spend around £ 600 , when you can buy the fake for £ 120 ? the website even states that 100 such bags are available			0
the site also offers a staggering 1,000 @entity274 coffee - coloured shoulder bags from the 2013 collection for sale for £ 150 each , whereas the actual price is around £ 700			0
another great @entity10 brand that is widely being ripped off by the @entity22 is @entity285			1
one of the fashion house ’s signature items is its skull scarf , which would normally be £ 245 , and has been worn by supermodel @entity289 and actress @entity290			0
if you want the same look for less , then you can pick one up from @entity22 for £ 3			2
shipping is £ 15 , so you will have to pay just under £ 20 in total			0
@entity86 brands are also faked			0
particularly popular are shirts supposedly made by @entity87 , which also sell for as little as £ 3 , whereas the genuine article costs £ 95			0
of course , a fake shirt or handbag is not going to cause you any harm			0
but some counterfeit @entity22 products can put your health at risk			1
real , left , a pair of £ 400 yellow and black patent shoes by @entity10 designer @entity79			1
right , in an imitation box , the @entity22 version sold for £ 18 smoking , already bad for you , is made even worse if you try a @entity22 counterfeit cigarette			1
the @entity10 is awash with cheap , illegally imported tobacco , of poor quality			2
in 2011 , @entity317 officers seized 12 million fake @entity22 superkings and regal cigarettes from a warehouse in @entity321			2
that doubtless represents the tip of a very large pile of ash			0
similarly injurious are bottles of ‘ scotch whisky ’ that are produced in @entity22 and often end up over here			2
such drinks can contain methanol — a toxic alcoholic liquid — which in some cases can cause blindness			0
last year , a wholesaler from western @entity22 was jailed and fined £ 50,000 for selling fake scotch , a rare display of the @entity22 acting against the fakers in their midst			2
the sad truth is that the @entity22 do not do enough to stop copycat cars or the counterfeits			2
and there ’s nothing that the likes of @entity71 and @entity87 can do to stop sweatshops in @entity22 faking their designs			1
it is therefore understandable that some companies consider accepting that being copied is a sincere form of flattery			2
the logic for this is that if you ’re being copied , it can only drive up the demand for the real thing			0
but it still seems wrong that the @entity22 should profit from the value of great @entity10 brands			1
if @entity22 wants to be a global power , then it needs to play by the world ’s rules — and not just rip off the creations of our most talented designers and engineers .			2

@entity10 brands such as @entity368 and @entity71 are copied
cheaper versions of the luxury products are sold en masse in @entity22
complex patent laws make it near impossible for companies to take action
