' pregnant man ' @entity2 's divorce from his ex-wife is trapped in legal limbo while an @entity6 judge decides if their marriage was ever valid in the first place because @entity2 , who was born a woman , has given birth to three children			1
the transgender made headlines four years ago when he became pregnant because his wife @entity15 could n't have children			1
the couple , who married in 2003 , are now trying to get divorced and work out the custody issues for their three children , plus the division of property and spousal support			2
however the family court judge assigned to his case , @entity25 , is questioning the legitimacy of the marriage , because after being legally declared male , @entity2 performed that most female of miracles - child birth			1
family : @entity2 was granted sole custody of his three children in may after footage emerged of his estranged wife @entity15 being violent towards him divorcing : ' @entity36 ' @entity2 , right , is hoping to divorce his wife @entity15 , left , but an @entity6 judge is not convinced their marriage was legal in the first place the validity of the @entity2 's marriage now hangs in the balance , as same - sex marriage is forbidden in @entity6 and the state does n't recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states			1
@entity2 was born a woman , @entity48 , in 1974 in @entity49 , @entity50			1
after undergoing male - hormone therapy he was legally allowed to change his birth certificate and driver ’s license to say he is a man			2
he was also legally allowed to get married as a man			0
judge @entity25 understands that , but as he wrote into the court record , ' in other words , it appears that , by any reasonable standard , ( @entity2 ) was the biological mother of those children at the times they were born			1
as such , parties ’ marriage was between a female and a person capable of giving birth , who later did so			2
' he asked the @entity6 attorney general ’s office for an opinion as to whether this was a valid marriage or a same - sex - and consequently invalid - marriage , but they declined the invitation to get involved			1
“ i was surprised at the remarkable indifference i received , ” @entity25 said in open court friday			0
so it is up to him to make a decision that , however he rules , is likely to be taken to the @entity82			0
@entity25 said he would reach a decision by early february			0
@entity2 has called the judge 's decision ' frustrating '			1
' i live my life , i know who i am and someone else 's opinion , even though it is a judge 's opinion is not going to change that			0
i am @entity2 , i am husband , i am father , i am a man , hear me roar , ' he told @entity94 last month			2
more babies : ' hypothetically we have talked about starting a family together and we would have to check out our fertility options ' @entity94 pointed out that he could get the marriage annulled but @entity2 , though recognizing it would be the easiest thing to do says : ' my marriage did happen and i was married to @entity15 for almost ten years , we paid taxes , we bought and sold homes , we started a family together and i want that to be validated			1
it 's being challenged right now so if i back down from it we all lose			0
' his marriage to first wife @entity15 reached a bitter end when footage of her appearing to violently attack her husband , mishandle their children and destroy their computer emerged			1
he has previously claimed that @entity15 was a violent alcoholic who would attack him in the night and once punched him in the crotch in front of the kids			2
in may , a judge gave @entity2 temporary full custody over the couple ’s three children			1
he said : ' it 's been a process			0
we physically separated back in march when i filed for separation and there was a protective order but basically i did n't wear my wedding ring for a year prior to that			0
@entity2 shows off his pregnant stomach before becoming the first man to give birth ' we were supposed to finalize the divorce back a couple of months ago and the judge is thinking it 's out of jurisdiction and potentially could rule it as same sex marriage			1
' @entity2 has filed documents hoping to prove his marriage ’s legitimacy , highlighting that both his @entity145 passport and his @entity50 birth certificate list him as a man			1
when he was in his 20s he began having testosterone injections , giving him facial hair , a lower voice and altering his sexual organs			0
the couple met shortly after @entity2 began taking the testosterone			1
@entity15 is 11 years older than him and has two teenage daughters , @entity156 and @entity157 , from a previous marriage			1
but at the age of 28 she had a hysterectomy because of severe endometriosis - where cells from the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body - so she could n’t have any more children			0
@entity2 had already had a mastectomy to remove his breasts , and hormone treatment that gave him an outwardly male appearance			2
new start : @entity2 and his new love amber spoke to @entity94 last month about their options for having a child together but he chose to keep his female sexual organs so the couple could have children			1
they bought sperm from an anonymous donor and @entity2 underwent artificial insemination			2
he eventually fell pregnant with @entity183 in late 2007 and had his next two children in quickly after , as he only had a short window of not taking testosterone			0
he posed for a famous picture in 2007 which displayed him as heavily pregnant but with facial hair			0
he told @entity189 on her show four years ago : ' i wanted to have a child one day			0
i did n't know how			0
it was just a dream			0
' the couple has been open about their sex life , revealing on @entity189 that the testosterone had enlarged @entity2 's clitoris			2
it grew to a small penis , allowing him to have sex with his wife , he said			0
in march , @entity2 revealed he had filed for bankruptcy and was desperately seeking a job to get his family off welfare handouts and pay his $ 5,000 - a - month mortgage			2
last month @entity2 appeared on @entity208 with his new girlfriend @entity156 and said that they had not ruled out having babies together .			0

@entity2 and ex-wife @entity15 are seeking a divorce to finalize their split and legally put their affairs in order
the couple have three children , who @entity2 gave birth too as he was born a woman
the judge in their case has questioned if their marriage was ever legal under @entity6 *law* because @entity2 is transgender
a *verdict* is not expected now until next february
