by @entity0 @entity1 remain proudly at the top of the table after capitalising on @entity5 ’s decision to prioritise @entity7 football ahead of @entity9 points			1
with a seat at @entity14 ’s top table at stake - not to mention £ 15million - the @entity11 coach made 10 changes to the team that drew 1 - 1 with @entity18 last wednesday			1
to their credit , @entity1 took full advantage , although they required a huge amount of good fortune to score , @entity24 ’s own goal arriving via some questionable goalkeeping by @entity26			1
mix up : @entity28 's second half own goal handed the win to @entity1 @entity1 : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 89 ' ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 ' ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 80 ' )			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47			0
goals : @entity28 ( o.g			1
) 65 ' @entity49 : @entity26 , @entity50 , @entity28 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 46 ' ) , commons , @entity58 ( @entity59 68 ' ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 46 ' )			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			0
referee : @entity68 attendance : 5,862 @entity5 ’s predecessor @entity70 did something similar at this same venue two years ago as he prepared for a play - off second leg against @entity74			0
on that occasion , a teenage striker by the name of @entity77 marked his first start for the club with a double in a 4 - 2 victory before going on to make his name with a much more important strike against @entity85 in that season ’s group stage			2
that day , @entity77 was backed up by the likes of @entity89 and @entity90 but @entity5 decided to leave out virtually all his blue - chip performers , with stand - in captain @entity51 the only man left standing after @entity94			0
in contrast , this was very much the @entity1 a team			1
league leaders on the back of three excellent results , there was no cause for the @entity103 to change a thing and manager @entity105 selected the same team that rolled over @entity107 last weekend			0
@entity105 would doubtless be happy to send the same xi out every week but perhaps the greatest threat to this continuity is the transfer deadline			0
@entity42 has long been the star attraction at the @entity113 and , as august ’s end nears , the striker is attracting covetous glances , not least from long - term admirers @entity118			0
celebration : @entity1 ' @entity38 celebrates a rare victory over the @entity122 champions there was to be no goal here for @entity42 but it was his menacing presence that forced @entity26 ’s error and he provided a selfless shift at the top of a unit that worked hard and knocked the ball around productively			1
the @entity133 international might have fancied his chances against a makeshift central defensive pairing of @entity51 and @entity24 but it was midfielder @entity37 who fired off two early salvos , clipping a free - kick into the side - netting and then sending @entity26 scrambling with a 35 - yard effort			0
with @entity59 , @entity65 and young man of the moment @entity61 left on the bench , @entity49 started with @entity146 as the principal striker , supported from wide by @entity58 and @entity60			1
it was a ploy that did n’t last long , with commons dropping deeper into a pocket where he could get on the ball , create and , when the opportunity arose , take a shot			0
@entity49 were n’t particularly fluent but created plenty of chances from @entity50 ’s improvised hook shot to @entity60 ’s double effort , each saved by the impressive @entity30			1
the @entity1 keeper was beaten , though , by a sublime effort from @entity162 , but the @entity165 midfielder ’s curling shot came back off the crossbar			1
‘ i ’m an honest guy - we rode our luck , ’ admitted @entity105 afterwards			0
‘ we have @entity30 to thank for a few saves but to beat @entity49 , you need that luck			2
’ the champions were n’t completely dominant , however			0
@entity51 was forced to head clear from under his own bar after @entity32 ’s looping effort beat @entity26 and there was also a claim for a penalty as @entity179 went down in the area			0
forlorn : it is another poor result in a difficult start for @entity49 boss @entity5 referee @entity68 made a similar call in @entity1 ’s favour just after half - time when @entity61 tumbled as he drove into the box			1
right or wrong , the moment signalled a change in @entity49 ’s approach as the youngster ’s half - time introduction for @entity60 injected some verve into the @entity49 attack			1
@entity5 ’s other interval switch saw @entity56 replace the toiling @entity55 at left - back but , instead of improving things , the @entity11 was one of three @entity49 players culpable at the goal			1
effective as a central midfielder , @entity56 ’s discomfort at full - back was exploited by home winger @entity35 , who outwitted his opponent before firing the ball across goal			0
@entity26 underlined his perennial deputy status by palming the ball against @entity24 , who marked his first start of the season with an unwanted goal			2
in @entity40 , @entity1 have a real talent			2
son of former @entity1 favourite and manager @entity51 , the teenager is easy on the eye whenever the ball is at his feet and he perhaps should have marked this occasion with a goal that would have clinched the points			1
@entity42 , who foraged hard without troubling @entity26 , set up @entity40 with the lay - off but the first - time shot slid past			0
substitute @entity224 had an even better opportunity but opted for placement ahead of power , allowing @entity26 to make a save			0
despite @entity105 inexplicably describing the last 20 minutes as being ‘ like the @entity230 ’ , @entity49 ’s response was non-existent			2
‘ the result is different class , ’ said the @entity1 boss			2
‘ but i wish @entity49 all the best on tuesday night			2
i really do hope they qualify as it would be good for our game			0

@entity49 lose first game of the season away at @entity1
@entity28 scores second half own goal to subject hoops to defeat
@entity1 top of the table with 10 points from four games
