by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 5 november 2012 the @entity2 economy is set to power ahead of the rest of @entity5 , with some countries at serious risk of descending into social breakdown , according to a think - tank			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 predicted that @entity2 output would shrink by 0.1 per cent this year , before rebounding in 2013 and 2014			2
its forecasts suggest that even @entity5 ’s strongest economies will be left behind by the resurgence , with growth of 0.8 per cent expected next year and 1.4 per cent in 2014			1
dangers : experts fear growing economic turmoil in the @entity20 would provoke a rise in civil unrest , similar to that seen in @entity24 , where anti-austerity protesters regularly clash with authorities this would put @entity2 in first place among major @entity5 nations , including @entity30 , with expected growth of 1.2 per cent in 2014 , and @entity32 on 0.2 per cent			1
@entity33 and @entity34 are predicted to remain in recession throughout the two - year period , prompting the @entity38 ’s economists to warn that @entity5 is on the brink of civil unrest			1
‘ the economic situation in some parts of @entity5 is moving from bad to catastrophic , ’ said @entity41 , @entity38 chief executive and co-author of the @entity44 report			1
‘ there is a danger that the economic problems will spill over into social breakdown in many areas of @entity5 as unemployment soars and governments run out of money			1
’ he cited anecdotal evidence of destitute people in @entity24 turning to desperate measures such as burglary and prostitution to make ends meet			2
business secretary @entity62 , right , has rubbished @entity64 ’s suggestion that foreign take - overs of @entity2 firms be subjected to a public interest test			2
in a report on how to promote growth , commissioned by chancellor @entity70 , @entity64 said ministers should do more to protect firms from foreign buyers who ‘ destroy value ’			2
but mr @entity62 dismissed the idea , saying regulation to prevent takeovers from abroad – such as the £ 12billion buyout of @entity80 by @entity82 firm @entity81 – would amount to ‘ economic nationalism ’			1
‘ i ’ve told @entity84 we ’re not going down that road , ’ said mr @entity62			2
‘ we ’re open for business			0
‘ some of our industries have been turned around by foreign investors			0
‘ the car industry would n’t be successful without them			0
’ mr @entity62 did say he was looking at ways to make it harder for @entity2 firms to be swallowed up by overseas predators			0
‘ we ’re moving to a situation that has n’t happened to a @entity97 economy in peacetime , ’ he said			0
he warned the upheaval witnessed in @entity24 could be replicated in other countries such as @entity33 , and austerity would ‘ just make things worse ’			0
the best thing for @entity5 ’s struggling economies might be a break - up of the single currency , despite the initial pain it would cause , he said			1
‘ the only future for southern @entity5 is a low exchange rate , ’ mr @entity41 added , pointing out that this could not be achieved while the continent ’s economic basket cases remain in the single currency			1
@entity114 will fly to the @entity115 today to drum up £ 6billion of arms sales			0
he will visit @entity117 and @entity118 before travelling on to @entity119 tomorrow in an effort to secure the sale of 100 @entity123 aircraft			0
the prime minister is also expected to hold secret talks with @entity127 leaders about the threat posed by @entity130 ’s nuclear programme			0
the @entity2 economy emerged from the double - dip recession in the third quarter of the year , with a boost from the @entity136 helping economic output up 1 per cent			1
by contrast , the @entity38 expects the eurozone economy to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year and 0.4 per cent next year , before returning to ‘ only marginal ’ growth of 0.4 per cent in 2014			0
the report warns the global economy is on a knife edge , with the outlook at risk of deteriorating rapidly in the event of political disruption in the @entity115 , or a collapse in the eurozone			0
the assessment forced the @entity38 to downgrade its worldwide forecast for economic output from 2.6 per cent this year to 2.4 per cent			1
next year ’s forecast was also cut , from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent .			0
