enjoyed the summer ? you ’re not alone : experts have warned that homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months			1
that ’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits			2
and it could mean we ’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months			0
professor @entity25 of the @entity26 said that the mild summer meant that more prey was available than usual			1
this means more spiders could grow to a larger size the mild summer has meant the eight - legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished			1
with temperatures set to fall , experts from @entity36 have said the larger - than - usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate			1
professor @entity25 of the @entity26 agreed with their predication and said : ‘ this year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on , and it ’s quite mild out there			1
’ spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments , researchers have said			0
they found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation , golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of @entity57 , @entity58 , were larger and had more babies			0
the say city an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame			0
' city - dwelling orb - weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows , ' said @entity70 of the @entity36 , who led the research			1
this study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities			0
both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females			0
mr @entity82 of the @entity83 tells @entity84 that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside , with males hunting for females			1
but he agrees that the particularly mild summer we ’ve had , not too hot and not too cold , will have given spiders access to more prey			2
‘ so they are appearing a little bigger than average perhaps , ’ he says			0
he explains that there is a maximum size that most spiders reach , and its unlikely spiders in the @entity24 will surpass this			2
however it may be that there are a larger quantity of large spiders , rather than a select few spiders being abnormally large			0
‘ i think it ’s more a situation where they are active this time of year , ’ he continues			0
a mild summer has given spiders more prey than usual ( pictured is an @entity113 spider spinning a web )			1
spiders often head inside at this time of year as males hunt for females			1
but professor @entity25 says there is nothing to fear because they are a ' free pest control service ' ‘ people are seeing them when they are obvious , and there might be more of them because last winter was quite mild			1
‘ the conditions have been better so there may be more around , and it ’s just the fact people are seeing them more and being aware of them more			0
this is particularly the case for house spiders			2
‘ he adds , though , that this growth is unlikely to continue year on year , and even more large spiders will not necessarily invade homes next year			2
but professor @entity25 said people have nothing to fear from big creepy crawlies because spiders are the a free pest control service			1
‘ they often feed on the most common species , preventing a few species from becoming dominant , ’ he said			0
‘ we want to encourage people to respect and learn more about their little house guests			0

experts say larger - than - usual house spiders will head into @entity24 homes soon
