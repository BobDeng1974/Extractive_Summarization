@entity0 faces @entity2 heartache on monday , when @entity4 ’s selectors meet for the final time before naming their squad for the last tournament before the @entity8			1
with eight @entity9 left before the global tournament kicks off , @entity11 and his coaching team of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 will convene to pore over a weekend of high - class @entity17 action before announcing a 33 - or possibly 34 - man squad on wednesday for the @entity2 , which kicks off in @entity19 on february 6			1
the @entity20 understands @entity22 hooker @entity21 will be in the squad after serving the fifth ban of his career but 27 - year - old @entity0 looks almost certain to miss out despite a string of outstanding displays for sale this season and a much - improved disciplinary record			1
@entity0 faces missing out on the @entity2 when @entity4 selectors meet for final time on monday @entity11 and his coaching team of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 will convene ‘ if he ’s not picked this time , @entity0 wo n’t know what more he has to do , ’ said a source close to the player			1
with a possible move to @entity41 giants @entity40 touted , the decision to omit the @entity28 playmaker may prompt him to move across the @entity43 next season and effectively end his international career			1
barring the probable return from injury of @entity54 ( broken leg ) , @entity49 ( foot ) and @entity51 — with the @entity47 centre ’s slower than expected recovery from a groin problem causing concern — the vast majority of players named on wednesday can expect to be involved in the @entity8 later this year			0
conversely , those who miss out will need injuries or loss of form from their rivals to stand a realistic chance of featuring in the global tournament			0
@entity67 flanker @entity66 will captain a squad which will also include @entity70 ’s @entity69 and fit - again @entity22 prop @entity71			1
with @entity73 and @entity74 set to be named as the first - choice fly - halves , @entity72 must decide whether to opt for @entity22 ’s dependable @entity76 or the mercurial but potentially game - changing talent of @entity0 as the third - choice no 10			1
the @entity4 head coach has spoken twice in the past fortnight with @entity0 — who has not started a test match since 2008 — to assure him he remains in his plans			2
but on saturday night he appeared certain to be named in the @entity85 squad to face the @entity86 on january 30 alongside rugby - league convert @entity88			2
the @entity20 understands @entity0 could be invited to train with the senior squad but anything less than a full recall will leave a player many consider the most talented of his generation bitterly disappointed			1
‘ if he ’s not picked this time , @entity0 wo n’t know what more he has to do , ’ a source has told @entity95 the decision to omit @entity28 playmaker @entity0 may prompt him to move across the @entity43 next season the @entity4 head coach has twice assured @entity0 that he remains in his plans in the past two weeks ‘ with @entity0 you either love him or your hate him , ’ said @entity4 @entity8 winner @entity100			1
‘ he ’s mercurial and he ’s different and he can do things on the hoof			0
‘ but the fact that @entity0 has had his chance over the years and probably has n’t settled in the @entity4 shirt means i think @entity11 will go with someone like @entity76 , who is a bit safer			1
’ @entity21 ’s selection , following a three - week ban for elbowing @entity47 ’s @entity113 before @entity114 , will leave many baffled			1
last season @entity21 admitted his already abject disciplinary record had left him in the ‘ last - chance saloon ’ after he was banned for 13 weeks for swearing at referee @entity117 in the @entity119 final			1
but , with his set - piece work still unrivalled among northern hemisphere hookers , pragmatism will win the day and the serial offender will return			0
@entity95 understands @entity22 hooker @entity21 will be involved after serving his fifth ban @entity21 makes his way off after being shown the red card for elbowing @entity47 's @entity113 in december @entity128 is another in - form player who needs a last - minute change of heart from @entity4 ’s coaches to stand a chance of resurrecting an @entity4 career that saw him win the last of his 47 caps during the @entity136			1
he is still under consideration , but his chances look slim			0
@entity70 ’s @entity139 looks assured of a place as a like - for - like replacement for the stricken @entity54 , alongside @entity142			0
the 36 - year - old @entity143 , back in contention due to @entity54 ’s potentially @entity8 threatening broken leg , has not been selected since @entity11 took over in 2012			2
but the experienced @entity67 has been the @entity119 ’s form no 8 this season and is desperate for one last shot at international rugby			0
‘ there is massive unfinished business for me as far as @entity4 is concerned , ’ he said			0
‘ my hunger to play for @entity4 is as strong as ever , stronger probably			0
i believe that i am a much better player than when i was last capped			0
’ @entity128 is another in - form player who needs a last - minute change of heart from @entity4 ’s coaches @entity143 is still under consideration by @entity4 's coaches but his chances look slim to be involved @entity156 will be included , despite his club ’s recent league slump , with a position on the right wing against @entity161 in his sights following an impressive return from a long - standing knee injury this season which required surgery over the summer			2
@entity169 ’s alarming loss of form for @entity171 , and failure to convince on the international stage , leaves his position in jeopardy , with another @entity70 youngster , @entity176 , seen by many as the closest thing @entity4 have to @entity40 ’s @entity180 playmaker @entity179			0
the midfield remains @entity11 ’s biggest headache			2
with @entity51 sidelined , @entity183 and @entity184 are favourites to start in @entity19			2
‘ i have an eye on the @entity2 , ’ said @entity183			2
‘ any young player who has had a taste of it and is on the fringes of potentially being back in the mix , it will be in the back of your head			0
i am so hungry for that opportunity again			0
’ @entity169 remains uncertain with his position in jeopardy after an alarming loss of form for @entity171			0

@entity11 and his coaching team of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are to meet ahead of announcing a 33 - or 34 - man squad
the @entity2 kicks off in @entity19 on february 6
@entity95 understands @entity22 hooker @entity21 will be in
@entity0 looks almost certain to miss out despite a string of outstanding displays for @entity28 this season
