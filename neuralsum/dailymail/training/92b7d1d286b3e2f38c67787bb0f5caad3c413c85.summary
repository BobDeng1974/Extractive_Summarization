the three factors that have the most direct impact on a wine 's condition are light , humidity and temperature by @entity7 @entity9 scientists discovered that red wine ages four times quicker when stored at home it is often said that a good wine tastes better with age			1
but a new study has found that if it is stored at home , fast ageing can occur , which leads to a less tasty tipple			1
@entity9 scientists discovered that wine ages four times quicker when stored at home			1
in an experiment , red wine kept in conditions mimicking a dark room in a house was less flavourful and contained fewer healthy antioxidants than wine stored in a professional cellar			1
the two - year study found dramatic differences between wines depending on where the bottles were stored			1
two hundred bottles of red wine were placed in a professional cellar at 15 to 17 ° c ( 59 - 62 ° f ) and another 200 were kept in conditions replicating a dark domestic room , between 20 and 27 ° c ( 68 - 80 ° f )			1
dr @entity38 , of the @entity40 wine academy in @entity41 in @entity9 , said : ‘ we discovered a relatively small difference in the temperature speeds up several chemical reactions associated with wine ageing and even promotes new reactions that are not observed at lower temperatures			1
’ ‘ after six months under domestic conditions the wine in the bottle was approximately as “ old ” as a bottle from the same producer and lot stored for two years under cellar conditions			1
the house - stored wine was ageing approximately four times faster			1
’ he said that the wine stored in the dark room had fewer healthy antioxidants and less red pigmentation than the professional cellar versions - making it less flavourful			1
wine is one of the few commodities that can improve with age but it can also rapidly deteriorate if kept in inadequate conditions			2
a wine symposium in @entity84 , organised by the @entity85 , heard that it is important where grapes are grown , as well as how wine is stored			2
another study showcased at the event , showed that @entity93 wine produced from purple @entity95 grapes had more ripe fruit characteristics , sweetness and higher alcohol levels than the same type of wine made in @entity101 , which was more bitter and had more artificial fruit and citrus aromas			2
researchers looked at the chemical and sensory effects of different regions using 41 research lots of @entity101 and @entity110 wines			2
an abundance of low quality cork trees with thin bark may be ruining the quality of wine corks			2
the reasons for the lower quality of trees , which has steadily declined for 20 years , can be attributed to climate change according to a team of researchers			0
the bark of the trees , which grow in southwest @entity123 and northwest @entity124 , might be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of climate change			0
the genetic study was led by dr @entity129 of the @entity130 and shows how the £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2 billion ) cork industry is at risk			0
to produce a good product , cork producers need bark at least one inch ( 25 millimetres ) thick - if the cork is too thin it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine			0
but the trees , called @entity142 trees , have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches ( three millimetres ) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum level			0
there are several factors like climate change , landscape changes and the dry seasons getting longer that could be causing the decline , ' dr @entity149 from the @entity130 told @entity156			0
‘ the change in bark quality may be the trees ' way of adapting			0
’ research led by @entity130 says the quality of wine corks is decreasing			0
they say this is due to thinning bark on the trees that produce wine corks , known as @entity160 ( pictured )			0
they have seen a drastic decline in quality in 20 years , and thinner bark means the corks are worse at keeping air out of bottles			0

in the experiment , 200 bottles of red wine were stored in conditions mimicking a dark room in a house , and 200 in a professional cellar
study found that wine stored in the ' house ' aged four times faster , contained fewer healthy antioxidants and tasted *blander* than bottles stored in a cellar
experts from the @entity40 wine academy in @entity9 , said a relatively small rise in the temperature speeds up several chemical reactions
these reactions have a large effect on wine ageing
the three factors that have the most direct impact on a wine 's condition are light , humidity and temperature
