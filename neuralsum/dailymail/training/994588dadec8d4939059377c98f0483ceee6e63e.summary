less than 24 hours after her embarrassing performance in a @entity4 debate , @entity1 challenger @entity0 will have to finish her race against @entity4 minority leader @entity6 without advertising dollars from her party 's most aggressive campaign war chest			1
the @entity10 has not placed any orders for commercial time there between now and @entity14 , sending a message that the party is leaving @entity0 , the @entity17 secretary of state , to fend for herself			1
no @entity10 ads are running today in the @entity17			2
@entity0 brought national eye - rolls last week when she refused to say in a newspaper editorial board meeting whether she had voted for president @entity21 , and doubled down on that position in the debate – citing the ' sanctity of the ballot box			1
' i 'll tell you that i voted for the president			0
' he offered ' i 'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in @entity17 in order to curry favor on one or [ an ] other side , ' she insisted			0
reviews were not kind , and the @entity10 has thrown in the towel			0
' the @entity10 has now spent more than $ 2 million in @entity17 and continues to make targeted investments in the ground game while monitoring the race for future investments , but is currently not on the air in the state , ' a @entity10 official said in a statement			1
@entity0 ' campaign has continued to air its own ads , according to the @entity59 , including one that claims @entity61 supports amnesty for 3 million immigrants living in the country illegally – an accusation whose weight usually falls on @entity1			1
until monday night 's debate , the @entity10 had maintained a constant presence on tv and radio , bashing @entity61 but the five - term senator has managed to eke out a consistent lead in opinion surveys , averaging a 3 point lead in the latest @entity76 average of polls			1
the @entity1 is trying to cling to enough seats to retain its control of the @entity4			0
@entity80 need to flip just six to emerge in charge of both houses of @entity83			2
the @entity10 is moving its @entity17 ad dollars to @entity85 , where @entity80 nominee @entity86 is in a tight race with democrat @entity88 , the daughter of long - time liberal pol @entity89			1
attack ads in that race are focusing on an old court deposition in which @entity86 conceded putting time and energy behind a business strategy to ' outsource ' jobs overseas			0
its @entity80 counterpart , the @entity98 , has just announced a $ 7.4 million increase in ad buys in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity85 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
on tuesday at the @entity34 , press secretary @entity33 could barely stifle a laugh when a journalist asked him about @entity0 ' unwillingness to stand behind her party 's president			2
' a @entity111 @entity88 ' : @entity0 was a @entity112 delegate to the @entity113 , but came back to the event four years later pledged to support @entity21 's renomination trouble ahead : @entity0 is 3 points down in the polls and @entity61 's war chest shows all signs of being solid in the remaining few weeks before @entity14 ' well , i do n't know , ' @entity33 told reporters			1
' i 've seen some of the news reports about her campaign , but i do n't know			0
' ' i 'll tell you that i voted for the president			0
minutes later another reporter needled @entity33 with a question about whether he believes he'violated the sanctity of the ballot box by telling us who you voted for			0
' @entity0 , a polished statewide office - holder , had been seen as the most credible challenge to @entity61 since he was first elected to the @entity4 during the @entity139 administration			1
democrats first floated the idea of running actress @entity142 , but that idea fizzled after @entity144 and @entity112 announced that they were backing @entity0 instead			0
@entity0 has said repeatedly that she is a ' @entity145 ' but refused several times in recent days to say whether she voted for president @entity21 in the last two general elections			1
she was a @entity149 delegate for @entity112 in 2008 but was pledged to @entity21 in 2012			0
as a foundering strategy against the @entity152 terror army and a @entity154 approach to the @entity156 crisis have shortened @entity21 's coattails , few midterm election candidates from his own party have been willing to welcome him on the campaign stump			0
@entity61 seized on that discontent , turning his contest with @entity0 into a referendum on the president – whose pallid popularity levels are lower than @entity61 's .			2

@entity17 secretary of state @entity0 has refused to say if she voted for the increasingly *unpopular* president @entity21
the @entity10 is throwing in the towel and moving its advertising *budget* to @entity85
@entity61 , the @entity80 's @entity4 minority leader , is up by 3 points with 3 weeks to go before @entity14
the @entity10 invested $ 2 million in attack ads in the @entity17 and has n't moved the needle against the five - term senator
@entity80 need to hold their current @entity4 seats and flip six others in order to *cement* control of both houses of @entity83
