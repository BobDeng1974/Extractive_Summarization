for sale : crumbling castle with commanding views of @entity3 and the threat of a wrecking ball in its near future			1
@entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity7 - built by a wealthy railroad baron - is a shell of its former self and now up for sale for $ 799,000			1
once stunning in its grandeur and featured on postcards , the castle has long been neglected and is deemed by town officials to be ' an unattractive nuisance ' and an ' extreme hazard '			0
the @entity33 earlier this year approved demolition by its owner - @entity36 the property is bound by a number of restrictive covenants that make prospects of finding a buyer bleak			0
town administrator @entity42 said the only thing a buyer could do with it is construct a 40 - room inn and 75 - seat restaurant - based on conditions attached to another prospective development plan from 1996			1
that plan failed to attract enough financial backing to go forward			0
' anything else would take agreement by the attorney general , the selectmen and the court , ' @entity42 said			0
backdrop : commanding stunning views of @entity3 , the 19th century castle has been left to rot and ruin and has lost most of its windows and frames the medieval - styled castle was built in the late 1890s by @entity24 , who was president of the @entity26 , @entity65 and @entity66 railways and had also served as president of several @entity66 banks			1
he designed the two - story granite edifice after castles he 'd seen on @entity72 's @entity71			1
much of the stone was quarried from @entity74 , atop which the castle sits on 20 acres			0
until his death in 1920 at age 86 , @entity24 liked to sit on his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of @entity3 known as ' the broads '			1
no @entity24 has lived in the castle since @entity83 's daughter - in - law died in 1960			1
she left the estate and about $ 400,000 to a charitable foundation , with the stipulation it create a nature preserve on the site and that the property not be used for commercial development			2
@entity92 days : until his death in 1920 at age 86 , @entity24 liked to sit on his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of @entity3 known as ' the broads ' the preserve was never created , the money vanished and , in 1981 , @entity10 's attorney general took control of the land and offered it to the town of @entity9 to create the preserve and save the castle			1
by then , scarred and stripped of much of its woodwork by vandals , the castle was already badly deteriorated			0
trespassers had left doors and windows open			2
the atrium skylight was destroyed and water had been pouring into the structure for years			0
in 1980 , then - town administrator @entity111 predicted , " it 's going to be the wrecking ball for the castle " unless someone steps in to save it			2
@entity9 residents did not want to spend the money to reverse the castle 's decay			2
town administrators convinced the attorney general 's office that the only way to save the castle was to permit commercial development			2
the principle investors in the 1996 project — @entity129 and @entity130 — are the sole partners in the @entity36 the property was listed for sale in 2010 for the dearer price of $ 995,000 but it seems the owners will now accept a lower offer since it is scheduled to be demolished they not only received approval to raze the castle , but were ordered to by the town 's building inspector , @entity140			1
the deadline was may 15 , but the @entity143 have been granted two extensions — and now have until oct. 15 — to demolish the castle and several buildings			0

' the @entity33 is holding a public hearing wednesday on changes in the deed proposed by the owners , including ending the public 's right to access the property .			0

@entity8 , overlooking @entity3 , @entity10 , has been derelict for decades
it was built by a wealthy railroads *businessman* in the late 19th century
@entity171 was left to hands of a trust but building was left to rot and ruin
now conditions upon its use mean it can only be saved if it 's *transformed* into a large hotel and restaurant
