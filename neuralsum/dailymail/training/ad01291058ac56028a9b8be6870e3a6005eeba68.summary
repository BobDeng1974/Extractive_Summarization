the stepdaughter of @entity2 victim , @entity0 , who called 911 and rode in the ambulance with the man she calls ' @entity6 ' has been told she can return to work , @entity8 can reveal			1
nursing assistant @entity9 , 35 , has been in ' quarantine ' in her small @entity12 apartment along with her husband , @entity13 , 43 , and their four children ages 2 to 11 since @entity0 's devastating diagnosis last monday			1
@entity8 has reported that mr @entity13 , also a nursing assistant , had been told he could return to work at the end of last week			1
but she is n't leaving her home at the moment fighting for life : @entity22 , seen here with a relative when he first landed in the @entity31 , is in a critical condition and is now receiving an experimental drug to help save him ms @entity9 whose contact with mr @entity0 - who remains in a critical condition - was far more intimate and prolonged than that of her husband , told @entity8 on monday : ' the @entity24 came yesterday			1
they said i can go back to work but i do not know what i will do			2
i will not go back yet			0
' doctors say that no - one is at risk of catching the virus unless they come into contact with a sufferer who is exhibiting symptoms			2
but it is unlikely that @entity9 will return to work until the family have gone through the 21 days considered the latest time between exposure and manifestation of @entity23			1
she does not intend to allow her eldest child to return to school before the october 17			0
she has no child - care provisions either - as her mother , @entity59 , 54 , the woman who mr @entity0 traveled to the @entity60 to marry , provided childcare and remains in quarantine in a secret location along with her 13 - year - old son , nephew and a friend			1
the decision to let ms @entity9 return to work is proof of @entity24 official 's confidence that there are no contagious carriers of @entity23 in the community			1
but ms @entity9 and her family still live with the fear that they may develop symptoms			1
she does not hug or kiss her children out of fear and the family pray together each day , asking @entity82 to ' @entity83 ' , to save their family , to save @entity31			0
it was ms @entity9 who first raised the alarm after mr @entity0 ’s condition suddenly worsened			1
he had been sent home from his first hospital visit with medication for his diarrhea			0
ms @entity9 had seen mr @entity0 following his arrival in the @entity60 at the end of last month			1
her children had slept in the apartment			0
clean up : workers in hazmat suits continued to scrub down and clear out the apartment @entity0 stayed in sick with worry : @entity13 and his family are being monitored by the @entity24 after visiting @entity23 victim @entity101 on sunday - the day he was taken to hospital and put in isolation on sunday september 28 , ms @entity9 said , her mother called her and asked her to come to their home in the now infamous @entity110 complex			1
speaking to the @entity111 ms @entity9 recalled her mother 's words : ' she said , " your step daddy is not feeling ok			2
he 's been going to the bathroom all night			0
you should come over and fetch him some breakfast			0
' ms @entity9 did not bring her children with her when she went over , though mr @entity13 also saw mr @entity0 that morning			1
he told @entity8 : ' he was lying on the bed			2
i asked him how he was and he said , " i 'm not okay "			0
' by the time ms @entity9 arrived mr @entity0 had no appetite for breakfast			1
she recalled : ' i brought him hot tea but he could drink only half of it			0
' a trained nursing assistant , ms @entity9 took his temperature which was @entity129 and his blood pressure which was low			2
she said : ' i went to @entity131 to get him a blanket and put it round him but he was so sick			0
’ it was ms @entity9 who told mr @entity0 he had to go to hospital and who called 911			1
she travelled with her stepfather in the ambulance , bringing the contaminated blanket with her and warning the emergency workers to be careful of ' viruses ' because he was from @entity141			0
they immediately put on their masks			0
yet in spite of this close and prolonged contact with mr @entity0 - who neighbors reported was ' vomiting wildly ' before the arrival of the ambulance - ms @entity9 and her family were left completely in the dark as to what precautions they should take			1
@entity8 first reported the family 's distress at having no instructions from the @entity24 and revealed that they had placed themselves under quarantine			2
when violent storms swept @entity12 on thursday they were left without power , without information and without food and diapers for their youngest child			2
power was only returned to their apartment yesterday			0
as mr @entity0 continues to fight for his life and remains in critical condition the emotional toll that this ordeal has taken on the family as a whole is clear			1
on sunday , @entity171 , senior pastor at @entity173 where ms @entity59 worships , told of her agony as she lives ' moment by moment '			2
he revealed that she had not been able to speak with mr @entity0 since his condition was downgraded to critical			1
he said , ‘ his life is hanging in the balance			0
’ missteps : @entity24 and @entity12 officials had to admit another failing on sunday when they revealed that a homeless man - who was in the ambulance after @entity0 - had walked off while receiving treatment it was confirmed on monday that mr @entity0 is now receiving an experimental drug - different to that given to two @entity31 doctors who contracted the virus in @entity141			1
pharmaceutical company @entity191 announced that the @entity192 has approved the use of its drug brincidofovir to treat @entity23 victims during emergency situations			0
the @entity192 has extended an @entity197 meaning that the drug can be used without waiting for the results of more stringent agency testing			0
meanwhile , @entity24 assurances that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow as it emerged that the homeless man who had been the first patient to ride in the ambulance following mr @entity0 had gone missing			1
officials were forced to admit that he had ' wandered off ' while under observation			0
@entity208 has since been found and is being held in the psych ward of @entity210 while authorities seek a court order to keep him there against his will until he has proved asymptomatic for 21 days			2
public health officials have insisted that there is ‘ zero risk ’ that he is contagious			0
the @entity24 has also announced that it may consider introducing screening to travellers arriving from @entity23 affected countries			0
critics have questioned the efficacy of health checks including taking travelers ' temperatures pointing to the fact that mr @entity0 was apparently fit and healthy when he landed on @entity31 soil with his deadly cargo			2
but the @entity229 has ruled out a travel ban from effected countries .			0

@entity9 , 35 , was called by the @entity24 on sunday to say she can go back to work
ms @entity9 was with @entity22 when he was taken to a @entity12 hospital . she made him tea , helped him move and was in ambulance with him
she told @entity8 : ' they said i can go back to work but i do not know what i will do . i will not go back yet '
it can take 21 days for a patient to begin to come down with the dreaded *disease* from the time they first come in contact with a sufferer
but *people* are not considered *infectious* if they are not showing symptoms
mr @entity0 , *42* , remains in a critical condition and is being given an experimental drug to aid his *desperate* struggle for life
