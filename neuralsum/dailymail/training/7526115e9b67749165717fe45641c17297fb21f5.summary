by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 8 october 2013 plastic pollution is not just confined to the world ’s oceans , it is threatening life some of the world ’s most beautiful lakes too , scientists warn			2
although many lakes in the @entity10 might look pristine , beneath the surface there are billions of tiny particles which have broken down from plastic bottles , wrappings and other rubbish that are slowly entering the food chain			1
researchers have found @entity20 ’s @entity19 - a popular holiday destination for families and those keen on water sports such as windsurfing - is contaminated with potentially hazardous tiny microplastics			1
many sub-alpine lakes might look pristine , but new evidence suggests they may also be contaminated with potentially hazardous plastics			0
pictured are some samples of plastic waste and microplastics found in @entity19 in @entity20 scientists from the @entity34 in @entity35 believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain through a wide range of freshwater invertebrates			1
over the past 60 years plastic has become central to everyday life but the planet has been subjected to a huge quality of non-biodegradable waste , much of which ends up floating in the world ’s oceans			0
scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated			2
past research has shown fish , birds and mammals are ingesting plastic particles which are retained within their digestive system , slowly releasing chemicals into their bodies			0
other research showed the plastic surface of these particles is adsorbing chemicals from the surrounding water an concentrating them - making them even more harmful			0
scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated			0
popular holiday destination , @entity19 is pictured the persistent organic pollutants ( @entity72 ) have been linked with numerous health conditions such as low sperm count , infant development , weakened immune systems and genetic defects			1
the plastics also allow alien species to invade other environments threatening biodiversity			0
@entity83 of the @entity34 in @entity35 said : ' next to mechanical impairments of swallowed plastics mistaken as food , many plastic - associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic , endocrine - disrupting , or acutely toxic			1
past research has shown fish , birds and mammals are ingesting plastic particles which are retained within their digestive system , slowly releasing chemicals into their bodies			0
the study showed freshwater invertebrates ( a crustacean is pictured ) will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab ' moreover , the polymers can adsorb toxic hydrophobic organic pollutants and transport these compounds to otherwise less polluted habitats			1
' ' along this line , plastic debris can act as vector for alien species and diseases			0
' the researchers chose @entity19 as a starting point for investigating freshwater contamination with micro plastics and normal plastic waste , because they expected it to be less polluted given its sub-alpine location			1
what they found surprised them because the numbers of microplastic particles in sediment samples from @entity19 were similar to those found in studies of marine beach sediments			1
the size ranges of microplastics found suggested that they might find their way into organisms living in the lake			0
@entity83 said many plastic - associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic or acutely toxic			0
pictured are scanning electron microscope images of degraded plastic particles showing examples of surface textures on sampled plastic particles the study , published in @entity135 , showed that freshwater invertebrates from worms to water fleas will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab. and the findings in @entity19 come as bad news for lakes generally , with uncertain ecological and economic consequences			1
dr @entity83 said : ' the mere existence of microplastic particles in a sub-alpine headwater suggests an even higher relevance of plastic particles in lowland waters			2
' while he admitted that more research is needed , he called for standardised surveillance guidelines to control microplastic contamination in freshwater ecosystems , which are already required for marine systems .			2

scientists from the @entity34 in @entity35 believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain via freshwater invertebrates
the microplastics have been linked with numerous health conditions such as low sperm count , weakened immune systems and genetic defects
the researchers were surprised to see similar numbers of microplastic particles in sediment samples from @entity19 as marine beach sediment
