by @entity0 and @entity1 when @entity4 landed on @entity5 in a hail of enemy fire on june 6 , 1944 the last thing he expected was that 70 years later one of the ' @entity9 ' he was fighting against would be a friend and neighbour			1
yet today , mr @entity4 , now 91 , and @entity11 , 88 , live side - by - side in the very town where the @entity15 commando came ashore in the first wave of the d - day invasion			1
they are two of the dwindling number of veterans of the @entity22 ' normandy landings and the ensuing three - month battle to push @entity25 forces back on the western front of @entity28 - occupied @entity27			1
enemies to neighbours : @entity11 , left , 88 , and @entity4 , right , 91 , fought on opposite sides during the @entity21 in 1944 , but they are now friends living in the same town on what was the front line time and understanding have forged a bond between the former @entity15 elite commando and the @entity25 parachutist from @entity40 , who are neighbours in the @entity43 town of @entity44			1
in 2012 they celebrated @entity46 together and next month both will attend ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of @entity21			0
' we 're like brothers now , it 's just great for both of us , ' said mr @entity11 , who took @entity15 citizenship in 1956 after marrying a @entity56 woman			1
it is one of the vagaries of history that both men live today in the same town where mr @entity4 landed on @entity21 , @entity62 in hand and a year of training under his belt			1
he was one of commander @entity68 's 177 @entity15 soldiers who battled the machine gun fire , landmines and barbed wire of @entity5 as part of no. 4 @entity73			0
changes : mr @entity76 , who fought with the elite @entity78 ( parachute ) unit , poses with his war - time photo			0
news of the landings set he and his comrades on a 220 - mile march from @entity85 to @entity43 mr @entity4 poses outside the number 4 @entity87 commando museum at @entity44			1
he remembers how a surge of adrenaline kicked in as he and his fellow commandos reached the beach by the town besides the unforgettable sight of the armada of boats filling the sea , mr @entity4 recalls checking and rechecking his weapons just before landing , and how the photo of his wife @entity102 in his pocket got ' a little wet '			1
' it was ok , though , i fixed it later , ' he said			0
' i still have it			0
' @entity25 shells rained down on mr @entity4 and his comrades even before they reached land , but months of training and a surge of adrenaline outweighed fear of the ' @entity9 ' , the derogatory term the @entity15 used for @entity25 soldiers			1
' commander @entity68 had told us what would happen to us : " it 's possible that not even 10 of us will come out alive " , ' said mr @entity4			1

mr @entity4 was one of 177 @entity15 soldiers who fought as part of no. 4 @entity73 bloodbath : free @entity15 and @entity129 soldiers regroup on @entity5 after the initial landing news of the surprise amphibious attack - along with those by @entity134 , @entity136 and @entity129 forces on the now - legendary beaches of @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 - roused mr @entity11 from his sleep far away in @entity85			1
the invasion set him and the rest of the elite @entity78 ( parachute ) unit on a 220 - mile march to @entity43 to shore up @entity25 defences and try to break the @entity22 bridgehead			0
' the night of the 6th of june we were woken up with an alarm - " the @entity22 troops are landing in @entity43 ! " , ' said mr @entity11			1
' we left for @entity154 , but we went on foot - 350 km. ' mr @entity4 and mr @entity11 were never in the same place at the same time in @entity43 , but they share memories - the impenetrable hedgerows that snared tanks and hid snipers , hearing the voice of the enemy just feet away , the mosquitoes that infested the flooded valleys , the small green apples that were too sour to eat , and the smell of human corpses rotting in the heat			1
well prepared : mr @entity4 is pictured third from left during his year - long training in @entity170 fleeing @entity154 on july 17 , mr @entity11 and his unit began a series of retreats , finding themselves eventually trapped in the ' cauldron ' , the @entity176 , where they were encircled by @entity22 forces			1
' the approach to @entity181 was horrendous			0
they were all around us with their tanks , especially their planes , they just did n't let up , ' said @entity11			2
' there were bodies everywhere ... there were 10,000 dead on the approach to @entity181			0
' hungry , lice - ridden and demoralised , mr @entity11 and his comrades from dispersed @entity25 units rifled the pockets of dead soldiers for cigarettes or food			1
' we had nothing left			0
our uniforms were dirty , in tatters ... how were we going to get out of this ? ' on august 21 , after days of aerial and artillery bombardment , and unable to escape eastward through a narrow gap the @entity25 dubbed ' the corridor of death ' , mr @entity11 was taken prisoner by the @entity136			2
he was one of the lucky ones - of his original company of 120 men , only nine survived			2
general @entity213 later wrote in his memoirs : ' @entity181 was one of the greatest killing grounds of the war			0
' it was literally possible to walk for hundreds of yards at a time , stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh			0
' mr @entity4 points at his july 14 , 1943 wartime photo as he visits the number 4 @entity87 commando museum			1
deployments in @entity129 , @entity15 and even @entity225 preceded a permanent move home to @entity15 for mr @entity11 , pow camps and forced farm labour were his life until 1947			2
with the @entity40 of his youth in ruins and under @entity233 control , he decided that his new chapter would find him right where he already was - in @entity43			0
mr @entity4 was shipped back to @entity129 after three months of fighting in @entity43 , one of only 25 @entity15 commandos to escape death or wounding in the @entity239			2
deployments in @entity129 , @entity15 and even @entity225 preceded a permanent move home to @entity15 for a career as a claims adjuster			0
after retirement , he moved to @entity44 and , while paying a visit to a restaurant in the town , the @entity248 , met its owner , mr @entity11			1
a book about the two men , @entity252 ( enemies and @entity254 ) by @entity255 , was published in 2010			0
mr @entity11 , his living room decorated with a cuckoo clock and beer steins , still has a full head of hair and the same gentle look that he had in his eye when he was photographed in his @entity264 uniform at the start of the war			2
' i hope we never see another war like this because it 's just not possible ... the young men , the young men on the front there , shooting machine guns , it 's just not possible			2
freedom and peace , that 's all i can tell you			0
' mr @entity4 thinks about the flowers that he 'll be laying on his fallen comrades ' graves next month			2
' for the young people - they need to know all about this , ' he said			0
' it can not happen again			0
we have to be vigilant			0

@entity4 , 91 , and @entity11 , 88 , live side - by - side in @entity44
that 's the very town where @entity4 landed as a commando on d - day , 1944
both men served in units that suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle
