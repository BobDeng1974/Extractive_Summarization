by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 11 october 2013 @entity1 got her killer abs by doing 30 minutes of crunches a day , according to her pilates teacher			1
the @entity6 singer has rarely been seen without a crop top exposing her slender midriff since returning to the spotlight with a controversial new image			2
and she puts in a great deal of effort to look good in her skimpy outfits			2
@entity1 at her @entity16 release event at @entity17 , @entity18 , on tuesday ' when we work out we do n't just do a couple of moves , ' says pilates instructor @entity22			1
' it 's at least a half an hour of working out			1
' you have to learn how to not just tighten up your tummy but actually pull your tummy in to your lower back as much as you can			1
just doing 40 crunches a day is n't gon na do it for you , ' she says			2
the @entity32 - based fitness guru revealed @entity1 has recently installed a studio in her own home so she can sculpt her body every day , and is especially pleased with the result @entity38 's workout regime has had on her lithe limbs			1
she told @entity41 magazine : ' i gave her those legs			0
she 's always going to have those long gorgeous legs			2
we just toned and firmed in all the right places			0
' she wants to be healthy , she wants to have good abs. it always makes her feel better and clearer when she works out			0
' @entity48 , spokesperson for @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , says you need to do more than sit - ups to achieve a fit physique			0
' while it 's great that @entity1 has attributed her abs to a daily exercise regime , there is not much benefit to be had from doing daily crunches alone , ' he says			1
' spot reduction is something of a myth and it is absolutely essential that any exercise regime incorporates a certain degree of variety and balance in exercise selection			0
showing off her midriff ( l ) skimpy @entity1 arrives to her release party at club @entity72 in @entity18 ( l ) ' if you practice crunches on a daily basis , your body will quickly adapt and stop responding to the exercise stimulus , thus making the practice somewhat useless			1
' @entity79 , @entity80 at @entity81 , added : ' @entity1 ’s physically demanding job in the spotlight requires her to be fit and active , so it ’s great to see that she enjoys exercising and working out			1
' she has the luxury of being young which can result in having a faster metabolism and a team of expert nutritionists and dieticians to hand to help her achieve such a slim figure			0
' in addition to this , some time ago she announced that she is gluten intolerant			0
for those who suffer with this condition , excluding gluten containing products may reduce abdominal bloating			0
by cutting this food group out , @entity1 ’s stomach would also appear flatter if previously gluten was causing her a problem			1
' coupled with her hectic lifestyle in the spotlight , i ’m sure her nutritionists recommend she eats lots of b6 rich foods , such as dark green leafy vegetables , lean protein and good carbohydrates such as quinoa and oats to help boost her energy levels			0
' perfect for someone with a physically demanding lifestyle			0

@entity1 , 20 , spends ' at least a half an hour of working out '
@entity120 coach says it 's about ' pulling your tummy in to your lower back '
