@entity0 has two years remaining on the contract he signed when moving from @entity14 in july 2011 , with an extension close			2
' i am here with the national team so it is difficult , but when i am back at @entity2 i will probably sign the new contract			0
' @entity0 started the first three @entity35 games of the season ahead of @entity3			1
it is a situation reminiscent of when @entity3 was installed as number one ahead of the established @entity39 after his signing from @entity41 in june 2004			2
@entity5 's decision led to suggestions @entity3 would leave , but the @entity45 goalkeeper remains after monday 's closure of the summer transfer window despite reported interest from @entity49 and @entity50			2
tough call : @entity5 has made courtois his first choice keeper at @entity11 staying power : @entity3 , paying here for @entity45 against @entity55 , was linked with a move to @entity49 @entity0 added : ' we do n't talk about the situation , but of course i know he has played 10 years at @entity2 and that now i am playing and for him it 's not the nicest situation			1
but that is the decision of the board and the trainer			0
' he is working hard in training to be ready when i can not play or i am maybe not playing well			0
' of course as a professional and a winner you always want to play every game , so we will see what the decision is of the coach			0
' but of course i am a professional player and i want to play every game that is possible			0
