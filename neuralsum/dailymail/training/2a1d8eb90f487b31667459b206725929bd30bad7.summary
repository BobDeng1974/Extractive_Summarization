by @entity0 ten years after former world rally champ @entity1 powered his @entity3 to a podium finish at the @entity5 24 - hours , @entity7 ’s most famous @entity6 , sir @entity8 , has taken his first strides towards racing in the world ’s most gruelling endurance race in 2016			1
the 38 - year - old , with six olympic gold medals and 10 @entity14 cycling titles already tucked away , has swapped his lycra for a fire - retardent racesuit			1
and having pledged to compete at @entity5 in two years , he ’s already scorching the @entity18 by racing in this season ’s @entity19 in his @entity22 @entity21			1
driver : sir @entity8 is competing in the @entity19 for @entity24 this year gearing up : @entity8 is preparing to take part in the @entity5 24 - hours race in two years ' time for @entity8 , @entity1 was something of an inspiration			1
as a then 19 - year - old and having already graduated from @entity37 racing to sprinting round a velodrome , @entity8 - who two years ago made an excellent documentary on the iconic rally figure for @entity33 - watched the @entity35 ace become world champ in 1995			1
' certainly watching @entity1 in action behind the wheel of a rally car helped create the motorsport bug in me , ' @entity8 explained during his first , flying visit to the 8.27 - mile @entity5 circuit six days ago			1
' his style was all about action			2
@entity1 was so spectacular to watch , flying through the air , landing on one wheel , catching it … how could you not be excited and inspired by that ? ' and it was while filming a section of the documentary at @entity55 that the wheels began to turn seriously in relation to his fledgling motorsport career			2
' it ’s really all down to @entity60 and radical sportscars , ' @entity8 continued			1
' during filming at @entity63 , we had a few other cars around to make it look like it was a public track day , and @entity60 was there with @entity68			2
' he ’d been following me on - track - i ’d been in my @entity70 - and he came in and said , " you ’re doing all right round there , ever thought about racing "			2
and i was like , " yeh , i ’d love to , but i ’ve no idea where to start "			2
passion : @entity8 is a motor - racing fan and he was a big supporter of @entity77 when he was young @entity19 : @entity8 is competing for the @entity24 team in this year 's @entity19 ' as it happened , @entity60 had a novice @entity68 series he was starting the following year , a one - make series , and he thought it would be perfect for me			1
' with a season ’s experience under his belt , fate was about to deal @entity8 another positive hand			1
when @entity24 - which is supporting the @entity89 and sponsoring @entity90 in @entity91 in 2016 - was looking for an ambassador , they turned to @entity8			1
' aside from the motorsport aspect , i was dead keen to get involved with that anyway , ' he explained , ' but then , once on - board , i thought that maybe i could potentially wangle some sort of motorsport opportunity at the same time			1
and it all just worked out			2
' i ’m very aware i ’m in a position of privilege , because there are so many people who would do anything to be in the position i ’m in			0
' so i ’ve never taken it lightly and just turned up , mucked around and had a laugh			0
i am having fun , do n’t get me wrong , but i ’m trying to become a better driver and take it seriously			0
' and , of course , it ’s not just about me			0
it ’s about every single person in the team who has worked tirelessly to make sure the car ’s ready			0
to make sure that everything ’s right about the car ’s set - up			2
rider : @entity8 is a former track cyclist who has decided to switch his attentions to motor racing decorated : @entity8 won six olympic gold medals , including two at the @entity125 ' when i turned up at for the first round at @entity55 and saw the scale of the @entity19 operation - the massive trucks ; the big motorhomes ; the tyre - warmers ; the fleet of engineers ; the amount of data - that ’s when i realised , ‘ hey , this is pretty serious ’			1
' in a way i thought , " right , it ’s not just me turning up and going into a novice race series , this is proper championship with a lot of money being spent on it "			0
so i was — and am — determined to do myself justice in being in the car			0
' and a. i do n’t want to smash the car up and cause damage ; and b. i do n’t want to pootle around at the back of the grid just larking around			0
i want to learn from the people around me and show respect to what they do and what they know			0
' i ’m obviously never going to become a great driver , but i ’d like to become a good driver			0
' partnered by @entity163 graduate @entity162 in the opening three rounds of the @entity19 , @entity8 - who ’s in action again this weekend at @entity161 - has already made an impression with his levels of pace and competitiveness			1
' i know i ’ve a long way to go , but we ’re all working hard to achieve the goal of racing at @entity5 in two years , ” he admitted			1
“ it ’s hard work , but hard work pays off and i ’m determined to be on that grid			0
' glory : having dominated cycling for so long , @entity8 also managed to claim 10 world titles pride : @entity8 is a proud @entity180 , as well as a proud @entity181 , and he is supporting the @entity182 after @entity161 , @entity8 ’s attentions will turn to @entity182 and the @entity184			1
i quizzed him on reports that he ’d apparently been ‘ snubbed ’ by the @entity184 ’ bosses in charge of the opening and closing ceremonies			0
has he been asked ? ' officially i ca n’t say anything , ' he smiled again			0
' so read into that what you will			0
if i was doing something , i could n’t say anything about it			0
let ’s put it this way : if i was asked to do anything , it would be a massive honour			0
' that , i would suggest , is a sizeable hint that @entity8 will have a role to play			1
and after the @entity184 he can get back to focusing on ensuring his dream to race at @entity5 becomes reality .			2

@entity8 is driving a @entity22 @entity21 in the @entity208 @entity19
