previous leaks from @entity29 say the @entity30 , the codename believed to be assigned to the @entity24 , will feature a @entity32 ( 2560 x 1440 resolution ) 5.5inch display			2
it will also have an octa - core processor , @entity39 - @entity38 graphics processing unit , and a 16 - megapixel rear - facing camera			2

earlier this month , in the face of stiff competition , and following a consecutive drop in profits , @entity3 announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year			2
