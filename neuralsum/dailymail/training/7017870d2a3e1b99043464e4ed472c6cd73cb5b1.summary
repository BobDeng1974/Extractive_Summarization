by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 14 may 2013 all eyes might have been on @entity3 ’s ankle , to see whether he was wearing his ‘ jewellery ’ – jailbird slang for the tag that allowed him to walk free from prison after serving just a quarter of his eight - month sentence			1
instead , they were irresistibly drawn to the waistband of his scruffy jeans , which presented an altogether different question			2
not a broken , beaten man returning gaunt and shame - faced , but a casually dressed ex-con marshalling photographers and attendant police officers along a narrow street to a small park near his home in @entity41 , central @entity42			1
lunchtime sandwich - eaters are accustomed to pesky squirrels , not the circus a grey - haired figure in a bomber jacket was now conducting			2
somehow the disgraced ex-energy secretary managed to walk straight into the lunchtime news to take centre stage in what we may fairly assume was episode one of the ‘ other things to offer ’ @entity3 claimed to have up his handcuffed sleeve before being driven off to prison two months ago with his political career and much of his personal life in tatters			1
@entity3 ’s ex-wife is to publish a book based on the diaries she kept during her recent two months in prison , her publisher said			1
the book , @entity87 , will be published in early september , @entity85 revealed			2
the book is not said to be a full memoir , but will draw on diaries the economist kept during her period in prison			1
the new book will use a style similar to @entity97 ’s previous publication @entity95 , and is said to be a very personal book examining prison life , but also a hard - hitting economic analysis of the cost to the economy of keeping women in prison			1
@entity97 said : ' i am pleased @entity85 will again be publishing a book of mine			1
i kept a diary while in prison and i have some strong views on how the prison system works , especially with regard to how it treats women			2
' ‘ we ’ve got to move – we ’re causing an obstruction ! ’ he shouted after discovering that his arrival by taxi had caused the road to be blocked by journalists and spectators ( and he would n’t want to break the law , would he ) ? @entity121 with his bisexual partner @entity36 , he told everyone to ‘ calm down ’ he then added : ‘ i would just like to say once again , as you know from the night i was sentenced , i said that i was very sorry for what i had done			0
‘ it has been a humbling and sobering experience			0
' i would like to thank all of those who have written to me – hundreds of letters that i have had – and all my family and friends who stood by me			0
‘ and i would also just remind you that i have served only part of my sentence and therefore it is not appropriate to say more			0
' i would now like to get on , get back to home , and continue with my life			2
’ out : disgraced politician @entity3 leaves prison in @entity138 today after just 62 days behind bars , shortly after his ex-wife @entity97 was also set free and returned home to @entity42 ( right ) freed : @entity3 was taken away by car at around 7am and driven to his @entity42 after two months away the entire show lasted less than three minutes before the front door of the £ 1.2million home he shares with 45 - year - old miss @entity36 slammed shut			1
miss @entity36 had come fresh from taking a law exam nearby , an irony upon which no - one remarked			0
she said the curfew would be in effect immediately and would operate from 7pm to 7am			0
‘ we ’re looking forward to a few dinners in , ’ she said chirpily			0
the electronic tag came a few hours later , courtesy of a visit from security specialists who attached it to his leg and installed a control and monitor box at the house			2
@entity3 had been met by his father @entity163 after being released on licence from @entity34 open prison in @entity138			1
dropped off : mother of five ms @entity97 arrives home having been released early from prison in @entity169 exit : @entity97 posed on her doorstep for photographers before slipping into her @entity174 home picked up : the former @entity48 mp carried his own bags to the car , and was then driven home to @entity42 returning home : @entity36 left their @entity42 flat in a black cab after the former mp was released from prison dumped : former @entity48 mp @entity3 left @entity97 for his bisexual mistress @entity36 ( left ) prison spell : @entity3 and @entity97 were convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to eight months each in jail ten years of deceit came to an end in march when @entity3 was jailed for eight months with ex-wife @entity97 after finally admitting passing speeding points to her			1
yesterday she too returned to her home , in @entity174 , @entity42 , after being released from @entity195 prison near @entity196 , @entity169			1
@entity97 , who will also have to wear a tag , told reporters the first thing she planned to do was have a cup of coffee			1
as he breathed in his first lungfuls of air as a free man , @entity3 would be forgiven for caring not a jot about the clothes on his back			1
but clearly some thought had gone into the outfit , because the disgraced @entity48 politician and erstwhile jailbird made his foray into the free world wearing a jacket far more trendy than any politician would usually have the style nous to wear			2
and , unlike his jeans , it looked to be brand new			0
crime against fashion or hipster cool ? @entity3 in his retro harrington ... and , right , how he usually looks more usually found in a wool overcoat or dull suit , for his big reveal , @entity3 had thrown on what looked to be a box - fresh @entity222 jacket over his button - down blue shirt			1
since the @entity232 , the short cotton @entity222 , with its checked @entity230 tartan lining and button - up collar , has been the unofficial uniform of mods , scooterboys and skinheads			0
indie bands like @entity238 and @entity239 adopted the look in the 90s – and now we can add @entity3 to the list of well - known wearers			1
a lookalike @entity222 from dapper - menswear.com on sale for £ 80 ( and styled , as @entity3 would have been advised to do , with a navy polo shirt ) they sell them these days at @entity249 , or on websites with names like @entity252 , dapper - menswear or @entity254 ( does @entity3 know he 's a hipster now ? )			1
it was a daring style statement from a man we are more used to seeing in a tailoring			0
and he could have pulled it off if it were n’t for that pesky shirt			0
for while the aforementioned cultural trailblazers wore their @entity264 with a @entity266 polo shirt or a pin - sharp checked @entity268 , the former energy secretary paired his retro jacket , rather schizophrenically sartorially speaking , with a thoroughly modern , sober blue work shirt and brown office shoes			0
swap that anodyne shirt for a natty polo and the shoes for some @entity276 and he would have been onto something			0
hell , he could have gone the whole hog and sped out of @entity34 on a @entity279 ( on second thoughts , speeding would be ill advised )			2
@entity282 : as for @entity36 : her blue leather jacket looked to have been plucked from the bottom of a bin bag before she put it on this morning			0
as a @entity289 adviser , she is surely aware of the importance of public image			0
could do better , ms @entity36 .			0

@entity3 and ex-wife @entity97 will serve the rest of their sentences on licence wearing electronic tags to ensure they observe curfews
they were both jailed in march for eight months for perverting the course of justice after she took his speeding points a decade ago
@entity97 ' very pleased to be home ' and will return to career as economist
she will publish book based on diaries she kept during prison term
