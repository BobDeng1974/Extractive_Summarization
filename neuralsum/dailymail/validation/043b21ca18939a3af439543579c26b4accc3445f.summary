@entity0 was last night accused of having a ' perverted sense of reality ' after claiming @entity3 would be like @entity4 if it walked out of @entity5			1
@entity7 frontbencher @entity6 said the former prime minister was in danger of losing ' heads and hearts ' by likening the @entity3 outside the @entity12 to @entity14 's pariah state			1
it came after mr @entity0 made an impassioned plea for @entity3 to stay in the @entity12 in what could be his last @entity19 speech yesterday evening			1
@entity7 frontbencher @entity6 said the former prime minister @entity0 was in danger of losing ' heads and hearts ' by likening the @entity3 outside the @entity12 to @entity14 's pariah state the former pm had earlier claimed leaving @entity5 would leave the @entity3 ' out in the cold with few friends ' and ' no influence ' like @entity4			1
but replying for the government in the debate , mr @entity6 told the @entity28 giant : ' our country has been turned around and is being turned but our country will prosper whatever the institutional relationship with @entity5			2
' we are a brilliant country with the most enterprising and innovative people in the world , and it ill behoves anyone - least of all ( mr @entity0 ) - to compare @entity3 's future to a brutal dictatorship like @entity4			1
' and comparing @entity3 to @entity4 shows a perverted sense of reality , and indeed you lose heads and hearts when you make such as comparison			2
' mr @entity0 had made the claim in a newspaper article published before last night 's debate			2
in the @entity19 mr @entity0 claimed that @entity47 and @entity48 have instigated a ' culture war ' urging disaffected @entity3 to blame foreigners for economic problems and so turning people against @entity5			1
the former prime minister railed against those on the right who have sought to address voters ' concerns about globalisation by creating a ' siege mentality ' that pits @entity3 against the continent , portraying support for @entity5 as unpatriotic			0
in what is likely to be his @entity19 swansong , the @entity28 giant said the only way progressives can win the ' culture war ' to keep @entity3 in the @entity12 is by winning hearts as well as minds			2
@entity4 leader @entity14 ( centre ) inspecting the unit 1016 of @entity72 and @entity73 at an undisclosed location in @entity4 @entity0 made an impassioned plea for @entity3 to stay in the @entity12 in what could be his last @entity19 speech yesterday evening			1
it came after he claimed @entity3 would be like @entity14 's pariah state ( above ) mr @entity0 cautioned against a ' @entity83 establishment - led , corporate financed ' statistics - heavy campaign by ' elites ' against leaving the @entity12 as ' technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances '			1
instead those who want to remain in the @entity12 must passionately affirm that ' @entity3 is not @entity3 ' unless it plays a leading role in shaping @entity5 , as it has for centuries - ' championing toleration , liberty and social responsibility ' before any other country			2
in a passionate speech which a handful of @entity95 attempted to derail with heckles about the former chancellor 's record in government , mr @entity0 called for @entity3 to lead a progressive movement in @entity5 to give globalisation ' a human face '			1
he told the @entity19 : ' there is no doubt that millions of our fellow citizens feel more insecure than ever because of what is the bewildering pace and destructiveness of what to them often seems an out of control and uncontrollable global economy , and they are looking for someone or something to shelter , insulate , protect and cushion them from these bewildering , often alien forces that have taken their livelihoods on occasion from them			0
business minister @entity6 attacked mr @entity0 in the @entity19 yesterday ' as they look for someone to hold responsible , and now they are being urged to turn what started off as economic protest , rather than a cultural prejudice , into a culture war - the main weapon of which is to blame foreigners , target immigrants and engender a siege mentality against the outsider			1
' mr @entity0 stressed the need for an emotional argument against @entity5 and a message that is bigger than the business case for staying in the @entity12			2
he said : ' i have to say that in this culture war , arid statistics about exports and investment from a well - meaning , @entity83 establishment - led , corporate - financed campaign of ' the great and the good ' , who will be accused of being elites who do n't understand @entity3 , will appear to many voters no match for the cultural charge from the right that @entity3 has ceased to be the @entity3 that they know and love			0
' you can not win in a culture war which asserts @entity3 is no longer a country you recognise just with fact sheets about the percentages of falls and rises in business investment			0
technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances			0
' when you are fighting back in a culture war that others have started , you must take on strongly felt sets of beliefs with other strongly felt sets of beliefs			0
' and if we are to win hearts as well as minds , our core message must be bigger than the business case , and bigger than even making the principled case for engagement			0
' we must tell the @entity3 people not just about our patriotism and our historic role at the hinges of history but how through putting our enduring @entity3 values to work , we will lead in and shape the future of this continent			0
' and that @entity3 which has always championed toleration , liberty and social responsibility before any country in @entity5 - and , as far back as the days of @entity188 , invented the idea of civic society and mutual obligation , influencing @entity5 massively in the process - this @entity3 is ready once again to lead a progressive movement , mobilising @entity5 in what is the greatest challenge we face			0
' to make the global economy and global change work for people , by tackling its injustices , its inequities and unfairness and by giving globalisation what it most needs now - a human face			0
' replying for the government , mr @entity6 paid tribute to mr @entity0 as ' a chancellor who dominated both the @entity208 and this @entity19 and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation '			1
the @entity7 minister said : ' it falls to me to respond for the government on this historic occasion of what may be the last speech in this @entity19 by you			2
' before responding in detail to the case you have made i think it 's only right that the @entity19 acknowledge this moment			0
' since you entered this @entity19 in 1983 you have been a warrior for social justice , a master of the despatch box , a chancellor who dominated both the @entity208 and this @entity19 and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation			0
' you have been a brilliant debater , besting @entity233 in his prime , and humbling a long series of opponents throughout your career			0
' but mr @entity6 criticised mr @entity0 for standing against an in - out referendum on @entity3 's @entity12 membership , as promised by the conservatives .			1

@entity7 minister @entity6 said mr @entity0 was losing ' heads and hearts '
came after the @entity245 made impassioned plea for the @entity12
in his final @entity19 speech he urged @entity3 not to leave the @entity12
earlier he claimed @entity3 would be like @entity4 if it walked out on @entity5
