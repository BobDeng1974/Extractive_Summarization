by @entity0 nobody likes paying a toll fee to cross a river , but these days there 's not much you can do but take a deep breath and pay up			0
not this skinflint driver in @entity8			2
he was so determined to get out of paying the fee to cross the frozen @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12 , that he just drove straight onto the ice			1
he negotiated the frozen body of water gingerly at first , but grew in confidence as he realised he would make the crossing - saving himself some 50p in the process			0
advancing on ice : the fearless driver negotiated the frozen body of water gingerly at first , but grew in confidence as he realised he might actually make the crossing - saving himself some 50p in the process the ice is right : onlookers watched in horror as the unidentified driver risked his life just to save pennies , gasping each time they heard the ice creak under the weight of the silver - coloured car onlookers watched in horror as the unidentified man risked his life just to save pennies , gasping each time they heard the ice creak under the weight of the silver - coloured car			1
it took the curmudgeonly commuter a whole ten minutes to cross the 1km - wide body of water before revving his engine with satisfaction as he drove up the bank on the other side			1
the nearest road crossing would have been the @entity49 which runs into the ghost city of @entity11			0
tolls are common in @entity8 and are usually collected as one - off payments , of between 5 and ten yuan ( 50p to Â£ 1 ) , or through a top - up card system charged on distance travelled between certain gates			2
the 5,464 - km - long @entity10 runs through nine @entity8 provinces and two autonomous regions , emptying into the @entity58 , in @entity59 in east @entity8			1
nearly there ! it took the curmudgeonly commuter a whole ten minutes to cross the 1km - wide body of water before revving his engine with satisfaction as he drove up the bank on the other side the @entity10 originates in the @entity66 and the @entity67 and empties into the @entity58 drain into the @entity69			1
it is also difficult to imagine from these pictures that at the early sections of the river the water runs crystal clear , flowing steadily and forming mirror - like lakes , including @entity77 and @entity78 , at the foot of the mountains			0
subsequently , the @entity82 name for the river in this section is the @entity85			0
however , further downstream , the epithet ' @entity86 earns its name , as it collects rich silt containing golden - coloured minerals .			0

the driver was so determined to cross the @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity8 , for free that he drove straight onto the ice
it took him a whole ten minutes to cross the 1km - wide body of water before he drove up the bank on the other side
