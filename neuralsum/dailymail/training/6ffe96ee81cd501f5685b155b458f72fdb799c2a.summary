by @entity0 judges and social workers have been conspiring to remove children unjustly from their parents , a scathing @entity2 ruling said today			1
it condemned family court judges for a ‘ clandestine arrangement ’ which meant that they simply rubber - stamped the demands of social workers without giving a fair hearing to the pleas of parents			1
rulings by family judges were ‘ cut and pasted ’ from recommendations emailed to the court by social workers , the @entity2 found			1
judges and social workers have been conspiring to remove children unjustly from their parents , a @entity2 ruling suggested today ( stock picture ) the secret dealings between council officials and local judges were revealed in a @entity2 appeal in which mrs justice @entity25 ordered that a mother be re-united with her baby			1
the baby was taken by social workers following a court case described by mrs justice @entity25 as ‘ profoundly alarming ’			1
the high court judge warned that ‘ the practices i have described are not confined to this area but are widespread across the country '			2
she said of the case , which involved judges at an unnamed family court and social workers employed by an unnamed council : ‘ it is difficult to view the justices as having been independent and impartial if , as happened here , they simply adopted the local authority ’s analysis of what their findings and reasons might comprise			1
‘ just because there may be tacit acceptance on the part of many professionals within the family justice system that the practice which operated here exists , that does not mean it is right			2
‘ it is patently wrong , must stop at once and never happen again			0
’ the order to end collusion between judges and social workers was endorsed yesterday by the most senior family judge , @entity66 sir @entity65			1
in a circular to lawyers , sir @entity65 warned all judges and lawyers to ‘ carefully consider ’ the case and added that mrs @entity25 ‘ had to deal with circumstances which i hope will never recur			2
’ the scandal over secret deals between judges and social workers is the latest upheaval in a year of growing controversy over the family courts , the closely - associated @entity77 , and the way the public has been routinely prevented from knowing what goes on in them			1
last year the @entity86 revealed that a judge at the @entity77 had sent a woman to jail in secret after she refused to stop trying to remove her father from a care home where she believed his life was in danger			2
all information about the imprisonment of @entity98 was banned from publication until the @entity86 investigated the case			0
in december the @entity77 was discovered to have ordered behind closed doors that a pregnant @entity103 woman must undergo a compulsory caesarean operation			0
the mother , @entity105 , was later told by a family court judge , again in secret , that her baby would be taken for adoption in @entity110			1
the order to end collusion between judges and social workers was endorsed yesterday by the most senior family judge , @entity66 sir @entity65 the secrecy surrounding the two court systems is now being loosened on the instructions of sir @entity65 , who has acted to prevent both clandestine imprisonment and the removal of children from foreign mothers by @entity123 judges			1
the exposure of private arrangements between family judges and social workers was exposed following an appeal by a mother whose child was taken into care			1
the 32 - year - old mother , a longstanding drug and drink abuser with a history of domestic violence , had had seven previous children			1
@entity136 are living with their two fathers and one is in the process of being adopted			0
when she became pregnant again , she was given a place in a unit run by a specialist family drugs and alcohol service			2
mrs @entity25 said it was ‘ plain ’ that social workers took a decision in advance to remove her baby , who was born in october last year			1
they cited the mother ’s bleak history			0
family judges first heard the case on 1 november			2
they were presented with an expert report on the mother , commissioned by social workers and prepared by chartered clinical psychologist dr @entity159			1
the psychologist , who also gave ‘ very strong and powerful ’ evidence in person , said the baby was at risk of harm			0
the judges declared that ‘ the immediate risk of harm is such that his safety requires the continuing removal from his mother ’s care			2
it is proportionate and in his best interests			0
’ at a second hearing a week later , the same judges said the baby should stay with foster parents because ‘ he needs to form an attachment with his primary carers			1
’ mrs @entity25 criticised the handling of the case in blunt and uncompromising language			0
she said the @entity185 report on the mother had been researched and written in a day and the psychologist had spoken neither to the mother nor the medical and psychological experts with whom she and the baby were living			0
instead , dr @entity185 had relied on documents and a phone call to a social worker			2
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ it surprises and alarms me that dr @entity185 was asked , and was prepared , to provide a report during the course of a single working day , a terrifyingly tight timeframe , and on the basis of papers supplemented by a telephone conversation with a local authority professional who had never met the mother			0
‘ i struggle to understand how dr @entity185 ’s apparently firm opinions , adverse to the mother , could have been formed given the complete absence of any kind of discussion with her			0
’ the high court judge said the family court judges had not written their own ‘ findings of fact and reasons ’ - their ruling in the case			1
the entire document had instead been emailed to them by lawyers for the local council before the 1 november hearing			2
@entity224 , the @entity225 mp who has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts , said : ' i am pleased that the senior judges are acting to stop stitch ups and " clandestine " fixing of decisions in the lower courts ' a near - identical document was drawn up by the judges after the second hearing			1
mrs @entity25 said this was ‘ the result , almost certainly of cutting and pasting			0
’ mrs @entity25 said this practice ‘ has become the norm ’ in local family courts			0
she said she was ‘ profoundly alarmed ’ at the practice , which was widespread			0
‘ there was , apparently , an established but largely clandestine arrangement between the local authority and the court which , to my mind , has considerable repercussions for justice			1
’ mrs @entity25 added : ‘ in public law proceedings the local authority is the applicant			0
it is not and should never be seen as the decision maker			0
that is the role of the court			0
‘ there is no room for confusion			0
there is no scope for dilution of that fundamental concept			0
’ @entity224 , the @entity225 mp who has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts , said : ‘ i am pleased that the senior judges are acting to stop stitch ups and “ clandestine ” fixing of decisions in the lower courts			1
‘ what really matters , however , is getting independent evidence into the process rather than the opinion of local authority employees who are instructed in what to say by their management , who are instructed by government as to what outcomes they want			0
