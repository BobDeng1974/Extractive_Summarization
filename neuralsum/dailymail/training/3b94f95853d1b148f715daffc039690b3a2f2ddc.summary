by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:12 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 7 november 2013 a woolly mammoth known as @entity3 is to go on show to the public in @entity6 , @entity7 from today			1
the three - metre long female mammoth died at the age of 10 and was discovered in @entity10 in 2010			1
the prehistoric animal is thought to have lived 39,000 years ago , and her perfectly preserved body was discovered in the frozen ground by tusk - hunters , who handed it over to scientists			1
people in protective suits examine a frozen woolly mammoth named ' @entity3 ' during a media preview at the @entity21 in @entity6 measuring three - metre long the female mammoth was 10 when she died			1
her frozen body was discovered in @entity10 in 2010			1
she is thought to have roamed the frozen plains 39,000 years ago			2
marks on her body including a long cut from her head to the centre of her back and an ' unusual patterned opening ' on her right flank , suggest that cave men hunted the animals			0
the mammoth appears to have escaped another predator at an earlier stage as it had a broken leg and other injuries			0
mammoths evolved from @entity42 elephants when the @entity43 set in			0
they were around twice the size of today 's elephants and weighed up to eight tonnes			2
their long tusks helped them fight predators and pick grass and shrubs out of the ice			0
visitors to the exhibition , called the @entity55 , will be able to see @entity3 's remarkable ginger coat up close			1
the woolly mammoth goes on show at the @entity21 in @entity6 today			1
while many bones have been found before – so scientists have an idea of how the legendary creatures looked when they roamed the icy plains – @entity3 is unique in being an almost complete carcass			1
a long straight cut stretches from the animal 's head to the centre of its back and there is an ' unusual patterned opening ' on the right flank made of small serrations as if from a primitive saw - like tool			2
this skilful butchery could not have been the work of a predator such as a lion and was probably the work of cavemen living during the @entity43			0
visitors to the exhibition in @entity7 , called the @entity55 , will be able to see @entity3 's remarkable ginger coat and trunk ( pictured ) up close although mammoths featured in cave paintings from the time , this is the first evidence that humans preyed on them in the days when ice sheets covered 40 per cent of the northern hemisphere			1
the find suggests humans may have contributed to their extinction , before the creatures were finally wiped out in the great thaw ten millennia ago			0
the mammoth appears to have escaped another predator at an earlier stage as it had a broken leg and other injuries , which suggest an epic struggle			0

they were around twice the size of today 's elephants and weighed up to eight tonnes @entity115 , professor of earth and environmental sciences at the @entity118 and a world expert on mammoths , said : ' there is dramatic evidence of a life - and - death struggle between @entity3 and some top predator , probably a lion			1
even more interesting , there are hints that humans may have taken over the kill at an early stage			0
' were humans using the lions to catch mammoths and then moving the lions off their kill ? ' mammoths evolved from @entity42 elephants when the @entity43 set in			0

a long straight cut stretches from the animal 's head to the centre of its back and there is an ' unusual patterned opening ' on the right flank made of small serrations as if from a primitive saw - like tool @entity3 has been preserved in spectacularly good condition and is the first mammoth carcasss to be pulled from the ice with its ginger fur still attached the discovery of @entity3 has been described as being of ' huge significance ' and could be the first direct evidence of early humans having attacked woolly mammoths			1
the prehistoric creature 's carcass with its ginger fur ( pictured right ) is also the first of its kind ever found scientists could dissect @entity3 or use infrared scanning to look at its organs and understand how mammoths managed to adapt to the harsh conditions			2
using the body tissue , which is normally lost , they can also use the latest technology to analyse its genome , raising the possibility of cloning a mammoth from the remains			2
@entity176 , of the organisation @entity178 , obtained the carcass , from the @entity10 tusk hunters			1
he is confident that they were not responsible for removing the bones and that it was the work of @entity184			0
the incredible find was shown in detail on the @entity188 programme @entity189 : secrets from the ice earlier this year			0
visitors to the exhibition in @entity7 will be able to see the extraordinary details of the mammoth 's well - preserved body , including the pads on its feet , pictured the remains were found by @entity10 hunters and handed over to the @entity202 science organisation woolly mammoths ( illustrated ) were around twice the size of today 's elephants and weighed up to eight tonnes			1
their long tusks helped them fight predators and pick grass and shrubs out of the ice the presenter , anatomist and broadcaster professor @entity214 , of @entity215 , said it was like a ' time machine into the past ' , adding : ' it just does n't look like an animal which died 10,000 years ago			0
it looks so fresh , almost alive			0
it 's a historic moment			0
' professor @entity222 of the @entity223 said : ' this looks like one of the most complete mammoth carcasses we 've ever found			2
' the vast majority of fossils are just bones and teeth because that 's what survives under the ground			2
so to find a complete carcass with all its flesh and skin and hair like this , it can only happen in the very far north of @entity10			1

the *young* woolly mammoth will go on show in @entity6 from today
@entity3 's perfectly preserved body was discovered in the frozen grounds of @entity10 by tusk - hunters in 2010
while many bones have been found before , @entity3 is unique in being an almost complete carcass
