footage has emerged of the moment locals made contact with a remote @entity4 tribe forced from their homes by drug traffickers and illegal logging			1
campaigners believe the indigenous people on the @entity11 river , on @entity13 's border with @entity14 , had their homes burned down and were shot at by @entity14 cocaine gangsters			1
they walked several days through the @entity4 rainforest , before telling a translator in @entity13 's @entity18 their relatives had died and vultures had picked at the bodies they were unable to bury			1
they also took weapons and tools after their homes were reportedly burned down the five young men and two young women , who were wearing loincloths and carrying bows and arrows , are believed to be part of a group of at least 50 natives isolated from the outside world			1
they first made contact on june 29 with the @entity54 local people of northern @entity13 , and spoke using the @entity56 group of languages unique to the @entity13 - @entity14 border			1
the @entity13 government 's @entity59 ( @entity59 ) intervened to protect the tribe , and released a video of the tribespeople accepting an offering of bananas			1
the video shows them shouting to locals across the wide , muddy river before taking axes and blades and returning to their homes			0
in one part of the footage , a tribesman is shown operating a rifle - though it is not known if the guns returned with them to the village			2
worrying change : part of the footage showed one of the tribesmen handling a rifle after taking supplies from locals living along the riverbank			2
it is unclear whether the weapon was taken with him back to the village health danger : the natives , who were carrying bows and arrows , had to be treated for flu but survived it is thought they came in search of basic tools and weaponry , but during their contact some of the tribespeople contracted the flu - which is often fatal for their immune systems			1
they were treated at an ' ethnoenvironmental protection base ' in the @entity109 indigenous region , which is protected for natives under @entity13 law			2
anthropologist @entity112 told @entity13 news site @entity113 : ' these people are in search of technology			2
this is important to their lives , because there is an internal " war " between them and the contact with other non-indigenous groups			0
' the government said they have now returned to their villages - but campaigners said they were still under threat			2
@entity130 , the research director at tribal rights group @entity131 , said there were up to 600 uncontacted natives in the region whose lives were threatened by development			0
' the latest situation is really serious and deeply worrying , ' she told @entity138			1
offering : the video began with one of the local residents wading out into the river near the border with @entity14 approach : after a moment of debate in a language native to the border , the locals accepted the fresh fruit ' what we think has happened , from piecing things together from what the uncontacted @entity154 have said to the interpreter , is they fled after their homes were set fire to and their relatives were shot at by white people in @entity14			1
' it tallies with information we have from @entity14 that drug traffickers are planting coca plants , making cocaine and trafficking it			2
' illegal logging is also happening in @entity14 and we believe this is pushing the people out			1
' all indigenous people have a very strong notion of territory			0
they 've had their land invaded and been attacked			0
they mimicked firearms being shot at them and one talked about burying people			0
' others they could n't bury and they said vultures ate the corpses			0
' she added : ' there are places that until 20 or 30 years ago were very remote , like the @entity4 rainforest			0
accepted : the five young men and two young women were dressed only in loincloths and live traditionally scenic : the @entity195 region of @entity13 is home to around 600 uncontacted indigenous people , campaigners believe ' parts of it are still remote , but loggers , miners and settlers are pushing deeper into the rainforest and governments want to open it up for gas , oil and hydroelectric dams			1
' that means more infrastructure is being built and the frontier is being brought down			0
' indigenous peoples are the vanguard in the protection of rainforests			0
there are hunter gatherers but there are also people who grow plants or fish in the rivers			0
' the group is running a petition calling for better resources to protect indigenous peoples ' way of life			0
a spokesman for @entity13 's @entity59 said : ' in dialogues with indigenous group through interpreters , they reported that they suffered acts of violence committed by non-indians in the headwaters of the river @entity11 , located in @entity14 territory ' as this is the region of @entity13 - @entity14 border and on these reports , measures that seek to ascertain the facts reported and implement an action plan under the @entity248 signed between @entity59 and the @entity14 government in march this are being taken year , in order to protect isolated indigenous peoples and the territorial border monitoring in the region			1

young men thought to be part of 50 - strong group along @entity13 's @entity258
they were ' driven away after homes were set *alight* and they were shot at '
natives spoke of vultures eating bodies of relatives they were unable to bury
some then contracted the flu and had to be treated by government *medics*
it is believed cocaine - growing gangs on @entity13 - @entity14 border are *responsible*
people are also being pushed out by oil and gas mining and illegal logging
campaigner : ' the latest situation is really serious and deeply worrying '
