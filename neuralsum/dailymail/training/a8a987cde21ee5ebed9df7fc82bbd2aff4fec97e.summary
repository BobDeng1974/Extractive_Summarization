following her appearance at a hearing in support of president @entity20 's quest to have all employers pay for birth control through health insurance policies , mr @entity4 called the 30 - year - old ms @entity12 a ' prostitute ' and suggested that she could make enough money to pay for her birth control by posting videos of herself having sex online			1

condemnations : @entity2 presidential hopeful @entity1 said that he was glad mr @entity4 apologized , and distanced himself from the controversial host by saying it was ' silly ' to think that mr @entity4 speaks for the party that was not enough to calm the nerves of at least one advertiser , however , as the ceo of @entity87 - a former sponsor of mr @entity4 's show - said that they would not reverse their decision			1
' no one with daughters the age of @entity12 , and i have two , could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well - intentioned young lady , ' wrote the company 's ceo @entity98 on their website			2

' if we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex ... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch ' @entity4 ' we hope that our action , along with the other advertisers who have already withdrawn their ads , will ultimately contribute to a more civilized public discourse			1
