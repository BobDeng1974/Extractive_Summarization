as @entity0 approaches , so does the prospect of the dreaded next - day hangover			1
but from @entity5 's bee pollen smoothies to @entity6 crediting @entity8 noni juice for her flawless complexion , it seems there is more to treating a delicate head and sensitive stomach than relying on a fry - up and hair of the dog			1
we 've asked holistic nutritionist @entity16 to sort the quinoa from the chaff and talk us through the new superfoods expected to be big in 2015 - and how they 'll help us on the morning after			1
models like @entity6 , left ) and @entity22 add superfood ingredients to their green juices ingredient : moringa celebrity fans : @entity28 and @entity29 best for : liver protection and blood sugar regulation most popular in powder form , this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘ miracle ' tree , native to @entity37 and @entity38 and one of the most nutrient - dense plants on the planet			1
it has been claimed that it boosts immunity , lowers blood pressure , alleviates stress , fights fatigue , improves digestive health and increases libido			1
and that 's just on the inside			2
it 's also a tonic for hair , nails and skin			2
so what makes moringa so miraculous ? it contains almost 25 per cent protein , including all nine of the essential amino acids , which are important for the body 's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells			2
it is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals , including skin - supporting vitamins such as zinc , which includes strong , supple healthy skin , nails and hair among its beauty benefits			1
@entity16 advises : ' @entity26 has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood , goji berries			1
it contains over 90 nutrients , 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals			2
' @entity83 for gram , @entity26 contains more vitamin @entity84 than steak , more vitamin a than eggs , and more calcium than milk			2
' its antioxidants detox and protect the liver , boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels			2
' the powdered leaves of the moringa tree can boost immunity , lower blood pressure and increase libido ingredient : mushrooms high profile fans : @entity102 and @entity103 best for : adrenal recovery and digestion according to @entity16 , mushrooms are big news for 2015			2
but these are n’t the kind of fungi you ’ll find in the veg section of the supermarket			0
these medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night			0
one such example is chaga , a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in @entity126			0
@entity16 said : ' chaga is a nutrient - rich medicinal mushroom , it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree			0
some mushrooms have digestion - calming properties - important after a big night out ' @entity119 contains numerous b vitamins , flavonoids , minerals and enzymes			0
' it is also one of the world ’s densest sources of pantothenic acid , an essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs			0
' ingredient : chlorella high profile fans : @entity22 , @entity6 , @entity149 best for : liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery we ’ve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as @entity16 stresses , there ’s more to this trend than just a fad , especially when it comes to the morning after			1
the one to look out for , she says , is @entity161 , a green algae and superfood detoxifier , popular in @entity164			1
in 1996 , research from @entity166 , @entity164 , suggested that chlorella , a freshwater green algae , can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking			1
the idea is that the antioxidant - packed algae neutralises the free radicals ( chemicals that damage cells ) in alcohol			1
@entity176 - which also contains iron , folic acid and energy - boosting b vitamins - is also lauded for its gut - soothing properties , as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten			0
fans include @entity22 , who adds it to her daily green juice , along with @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity149 , to name a few			1
grown in the @entity187 and the high @entity189 mountains of @entity190 , nut - like sacha inchi seeds are even thought to aid weight loss ingredient : @entity193 high profile fans : dr @entity195 best for : protein - filled morning after snacks after a festive night out , it can be tempting to spend the next day grazing on high fat foods to feel better			0
but as @entity16 explains , there ’s a much healthier alternative to fill the stomach - sacha inchi seeds			1
speaking about the peanut - like seed , she said : ' one of the richest sources in the world of omega fatty acids , @entity193 are also loaded with protein , fibre and antioxidants			0
' in the @entity187 in @entity190 , the ingredient has been cultivated by indigenous people for centuries			0
' @entity215 television host dr @entity195 also included sacha inchi on his list of @entity217 and worst of 2010 - your guide as the best weight - loss snack			0
he claimed that they are loaded with vitamin e , omega - 3s fatty acids and have anti-inflammatory properties that can attack stomach fat			0
if you 're looking to carry on the celebrations but still want to reap the benefits of superfoods , @entity227 's first bar dedicated to superfood cocktails has opened its doors and the new range of tasty tipples may even hinder a hangover			1
@entity237 's cafe , located within the @entity238 in @entity239 , was the brainchild of raw food specialist and wellness coach , @entity242			0
speaking to @entity243 about her bar , which mixes organic spirits with only superfoods and cold - pressed juices , @entity237 said : ' the menu is designed to reflect your busy schedule and provide loving nourishment at all times of the day			1
' you can get your morning green juice , which is cold pressed and organic or a pour - over coffee with hazelnut milk , a satisfyingly delicious plant - based burger and decadent raw chocolate cake for lunch			0
' then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood - packed cocktails , that are made with only top quality , vegan and ethically sourced alcohol			0
' everything is organic , hand picked and raw			0
' one of her most popular requests is a drink called what the doctor ordered , a combination of vodka , lemon , beetroot , carrot , sweet potato , raw honey , ginger , lavender and chia seeds			2
another cocktail on offer includes a combination of walnut - infused vodka , fresh cherries , cacao powder ( packed with antioxidants and magnesium ) , acai berry ( used by athletes for stamina ) , vanilla bitters and maple syrup			0
there 's also a tipple full of the sugar cane spirit cachaca shaken up with lime , coconut palm sugar and maca powder ( from a @entity190 root ) , well known for its energy - boosting properties			0
so are the cocktails , which cost around £ 10 , too good to be true ? @entity303 , @entity304 at @entity305 , said : ' promoting good health while drinking alcohol may seem counterproductive , however by adding superfoods to the mix it offers a revolutionary healthy spin on some of our most celebratory drinks			1
' by using superfoods , the most nutrient - dense ingredients nature has to offer , you can transform even the most empty calorie cocktails into health - boosting mixtures packed full of antioxidants , minerals and vitamins			1
' there are superfoods for every season , and the accessibility of superfoods makes these cocktails readily available for even the novice bartender			2
' since there is always an in - season option , finding innovative ingredients with health giving benefits for cocktails is a breeze			1
