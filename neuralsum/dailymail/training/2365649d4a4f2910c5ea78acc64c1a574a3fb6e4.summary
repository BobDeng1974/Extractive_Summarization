@entity0 has called @entity4 ' unprofessional ' for skipping his fall 2014 show in favor of flying on to @entity3			1
mr @entity0 is so furious that he held a press conference to openly denounce the @entity8 @entity7 editor after his fashion show on monday - @entity10 's final day			1
‘ she took an airplane , dumped [ me ] and went to @entity16 … ’ said the designer , 79 , whose brand is a major advertiser in ms @entity4 's magazine			0
' it 's not professional			0
’ unhappy : @entity0 ( pictured taking a final bow at his fashion show on monday ) has spoken out against @entity4 's absence at his show he added : ‘ she is influential and powerful			2
but , perhaps , i ’m influential as well			0
’ mr @entity0 says ms @entity4 assured him that other high - ranking representatives from her publication attended the show in her place			1
but the designer was not impressed by this			0
‘ she said she was sending her people			0
but if you go to see your dentist and he puts you in the hands of his assistant , what ’s your reaction ? ’ he said			2
a spokesperson for @entity7 told @entity36 that ‘ @entity4 has the greatest respect for @entity0 and everything he has done for @entity39 and fashion worldwide			1
‘ unfortunately , with the fashion calendar now running for more than a month , there are some shows that @entity4 is not able to attend			0
’ mr @entity0 blames ms @entity4 ’s absence on the fact that he is the only influential designer to show on the final day of @entity10 – a prestigious schedule slot that he has held for the past two decades			1
around town : ms @entity4 had been spotted in the front row of other @entity10 shows before leaving for @entity16 , including @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) he told reporters backstage after his preview show that the @entity10 calendar needs to be altered to maintain high - profile designers until the end			2
mr @entity0 explained that the @entity57 , which presides over the schedule , is at fault			1
‘ when we decided to show the last day , other big brands were involved			2
but currently this is an empty day , ’ he said			0
in the last few years mr @entity0 has been an outspoken critic of the @entity57 ’s refusal to coordinate its fashion week dates with the world ’s other major fashion weeks			1
currently , there is an overlap , giving fashion editors and buyers a maximum of twelve hours between the end of one city 's fashion week and the beginning of another			0
ms @entity4 has been known to leave @entity10 early for this reason			0
she also often leaves @entity3 early to return to @entity78 to publish @entity7			2
what she missed : mr @entity0 's collection exhibited his signature for tailoring , fabricated in a primary wash of grey and green however , this season she may stay for @entity16 ’s entire duration in order to catch @entity89 ’s debut show for @entity90 , which is scheduled for march 5 – the event ’s final day			1
@entity92 , the @entity57 president told @entity36 that his organization spoke with mr @entity0 after his press conference to resolve their issues			1
‘ we met mr @entity0 earlier and he is totally fine now			1
in a certain way , it ’s right that the important journalists stay until the end of the week , and next season , we will try to guarantee the presence of other big brands the last day , ’ he said			0

the @entity8 @entity7 editor skipped mr @entity0 ’s show in favor of @entity3 , which starts today
