will @entity0 win the @entity1 without @entity2 ? @entity0 has woken to realise it was not all a mind - bending dream of disturbing contradictions			1
yes , the @entity1 hosts are into the last four			2
and , yes , @entity2 is out of the competition , injured in a quite innocuous incident at the fag - end of a chaotic quarter - final against @entity11			1
' to win the @entity1 without him ? ' asked @entity13 - based newspaper @entity12 on its front page ; a headline to accompany the image of @entity2 being carted from the pitch in the city 's @entity18			1
' gained but lost , ' was another headline and ' @entity21 ' declared @entity22 do @entity23 , with a split front page to mirror the ecstatic features of @entity26 after his goal from a free - kick , @entity0 ’s second in a 2 - 1 win , and the tragic early exit of @entity2 prone on a stretcher with his face screwed up in pain			1
agony : @entity2 lies in agony after being kneed in the back just three mintues from the end stretchered off : @entity2 is carried away by medics leaving all @entity42 fans in a state of panic carried away : @entity2 was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after @entity0 's quarter - final win there were detailed diagrams to explain how @entity0 ’s poster - boy had a tiny crack in the third vertebra , near the bottom of his spine , in more or less the area where @entity56 connected with his knee			1
outside in the streets of @entity13 , the debris from a night of muted celebration was being cleared and market traders were adorning their stalls once again with replica @entity0 shirts with ' @entity2 ' and a @entity65 emblazoned on the back			1
he seems set to remain the commercial force of the @entity1 but @entity69 must begin the process of finding a creative force to replace his playmaker on the pitch , ahead of a semi-final against @entity76			1
@entity69 must lift the spirits , convince the nation this campaign does not end with the exit of @entity2 and a one - match ban for captain @entity82 , also ruled out of tuesday ’s game in @entity84			1
more than that , he must convince his team			0
the gloom descended as @entity0 ’s players shuffled through what is called the ' @entity91 ' , the area set aside by @entity92 where players are made available for interview after each game			2
it is a snaking route like you might find at an airport or in a post office			0
the first to emerge told how they would pray for @entity2 ’s speedy recovery , how important he was to their progress			2
by the time the final ones trailed through , an hour or so later , the reports from the hospital were filtering though			0
@entity2 was definitely out , according to @entity42 broadcasters as they buzzed around			0
the team doctor had confirmed it			0
this news was relayed to players as they were interviewed and the tone altered from one of hope and optimism to one of sadness and regret			0
cynical : with the ball nowhere near @entity56 smashed his knee into the lower part of @entity2 's back man down : the @entity124 forward falls to the ground after the challenge that rules him out of the semi-final the damage : @entity42 television stations obtained an x-ray of @entity2 's back and highlighted the broken bone welcome back : there were emotional scenes as @entity2 was greeted by his team - mates upon returning to the base at @entity137 @entity138 had already climbed aboard the bus and as he wakes this morning , he will find millions of hopeful eyes turning in his direction , just like when he carried the famous no 10 on his back , as he did until last year			1
@entity69 ' demoted ' @entity138 to no 11 and the quiet and diligent @entity144 midfielder was forced wider to accommodate @entity2 in the same way he was often forced out wide at @entity146 until @entity147 arrived and sold @entity148			1
despite @entity148 ’s brilliance over two years in @entity151 , @entity147 ’s decision did not seem entirely absurd because @entity138 started last season in wonderful touch			0
there were goals , assists and shimmies and feints , combined with wiry strength and an appetite to work hard and contribute defensively			0
as the season went on he faded , however , prompting the @entity144 manager to wonder aloud if he did not like the winter weather			0
there were flickers and moments of quality but @entity138 could not reproduce his early - season form			1
he has scored only twice in the last 18 games for his club , two goals in the same game against @entity173			0
room for improvement : @entity138 will be expected to step up in the absence of @entity2 against @entity76 @entity177 : @entity138 , pictured here in action against @entity11 , has failed to hit top form like his compatriot @entity2 at this @entity1 , too , he has been subdued			1
there was a 90th - minute goal against @entity185 but he has been largely eclipsed by @entity2 ’s goals and public dazzle , even though giant billboard posters of @entity138 with @entity190 pants and six - pack on display are a frequent sight around @entity0			1
this is the time to reclaim his place as playmaker for the @entity0			0
if they are to survive this setback and win a sixth world title in the @entity200 , then they need @entity138 to spark into life			0
@entity0 needs the sublime and creative @entity138 who marked his first @entity144 start with two magical goals in the @entity204 against @entity205			1
he is still only 22 , seven months younger than @entity2 , who was the youngest @entity42 to carry the honour ( or is it a burden , these days ) of wearing the no 10 at a @entity1			2
@entity138 will continue to wear no 11 but he must start to think again like a @entity65			0
there is no doubt he has the craft and the vision although - more than an individualist like @entity2 , he thrives on the movement of others around him : runners to thread passes to , team - mates on his wavelength to combine with			2
expectation : @entity138 and quarter - final hero @entity26 ( right ) have the weight of @entity0 on their shoulders vision : the @entity144 midfielder relies on the movement of his team - mates to get the best out of himself he certainly can threaten goal if he is moved into the centre as many expect he will be in @entity69 ’s enforced reshuffle , to play behind centre - forward @entity232 , with his @entity144 team - mate @entity234 and @entity235 of @entity236 the leading candidates to come into the team			1
@entity0 ’s @entity144 connection will be strengthened if @entity234 gets the nod			2
@entity26 may be bound for @entity241 but he remains a @entity242 for the moment , and @entity244 has made important contributions albeit mostly from the bench in @entity69 ’s team			0
the @entity248 can lay claim to the fab four if @entity0 achieve their dream , just as @entity173 claimed to be the driving force behind @entity253 ’s world title in 1998 and @entity254 with @entity255 in 1966			2
if that is to become reality , it is time for @entity138 to step forward and deliver			0
to prove they can do it without @entity2			0
it is time for @entity0 's other @entity65 to step forward .			2

@entity2 has been ruled out of the @entity1 after suffering a broken bone in his back against @entity11
the hosts beat their @entity267 rivals 2 - 1 in @entity13
@entity138 must improve and become his country 's creative force
the @entity144 midfielder has failed to find his best form at the *tournament*
@entity0 face @entity76 in their semi-final on tuesday in @entity84
