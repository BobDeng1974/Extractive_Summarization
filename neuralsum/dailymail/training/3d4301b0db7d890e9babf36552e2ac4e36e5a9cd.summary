painful : @entity0 , 44 , sliced his hand off in his garden with a homemade guillotine to end years of pain - but it still hurts a motorcycle crash victim has amputated his injured hand with a homemade guillotine to end 16 years of unbearable pain only to find his arm still hurts			1
desperate @entity0 , 44 , says he was driven to cut it off because the @entity12 refused to , and even burned his severed limb to ensure surgeons could not reattach it			1
the father - of - one took a fortnight to build the guillotine using an axe , some springs and an old gate post , which took his left hand off ten days ago			1
but unfortunately the @entity23 amputation in his garden , carried out without any anaesthetic , has failed to take away the pain that has tormented him since he was 28			1
mr @entity0 from @entity27 , @entity28 , has now told his local hospital that unless they cut his arm off from the elbow by december he will do it himself			1
the unemployed former garage owner , who is right handed , says his severe pain began after a 1998 motorbike accident left him with nerve damage			2
but doctors refused to operate because they considered his hand and wrist healthy , he said			2
' i should not have to go to such extremes to get my pain stopped , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' there was an alternative and that was having it done properly in hospital			0
but no one would do anything to help me - so i did it myself			2
' i got rid of it because they told me they had problems amputating my arm with a good hand on it			1
' so it took it off myself and now there is no reason why the ca n't operate			0
' when he sliced it off his horrified wife @entity58 came home ten minutes later and found her husband had tossed the severed limb onto a fire in the garden			1
she called the emergency services but by the time police and paramedics arrived the hand had been too badly burnt to be saved			1
mr @entity0 says he lost two pints of blood but paramedics were able to stabilise him			1
he previously tried to use a knife to remove his hand but only managed to severe three tendons and a nerve			2
mr @entity0 then threw his hand on a fire to stop anyone reattaching it determined : the stump of @entity0 's arm after he chopped his own hand off after years of battling with the @entity12 sabotage : as soon as his hand was removed he tossed it into a fire he started in this bucket to ensure it could not be reattached mr @entity0 says doctors now have no excuse not to operate			1
the former biker hopes he will now get a more ' reasonable hearing ' from medics now they can see how determined he is			0
he takes 40 painkillers a day but wants a device called a spinal stimulator implanted into his back to ease his pain			0
mr @entity0 said : ' there should never have been any need for me to do this			2
' it would have spared so much distress all round but it was the only way			0
at least if i do have the treatment it will i need it will give me and my family our lives back			0
' i 've told them that if nothing is done , i will take the arm off above the elbow myself			1
i 've given them until the end of december			0
' mr @entity0 insist he has undergone three psychiatric evaluations and passed all of them and police admitted that he was still ' rational ' after his amputation			1
he also says he barely felt anything as his homemade guillotine came down because he used a weight strapped to it to ensure it had enough force to amputate his hand			0
the first blow sliced though the bone but did it not sever all the tendons , leaving his hand hanging off			2
previous attempt : the father - of - one had in the past tried to cut his hand off with a knife - but failed - so decided on a guillotine his family have since dismantled his device and banned him from going into the tool shed where he built it in secret			1
' i bought an axe and got some bits of wood together before assembling them in the shed			0
' it took me two weeks to build because i had to wait until my wife was out of the way			0
plan : mr @entity0 said he waited for his family to be out of the house before he sliced off his hand			1
he is now banned from the shed where he made the guillotine in secret ' on the day itself i planned everything to a tee			0
i got my wife cleaning the car and went down to the shed , assembled the gadget outside , put my arm under it , looked away - and dropped the axe			1
' at first i did n't think it had worked because i did n't feel anything - but then i looked down and could see the bone cut through			2
' there was a little flesh and tendons still there so i used a scalpel to remove them , that was the painful bit			0
' i used three bandages and cable ties to contain the blood before scalding the artery			0
' i then texted my wife to call an ambulance and went inside to admit what i 'd done			0
' the blood was going everywhere so my wife got a hose out to hose down all the blood and mess			0
' she called the emergency services and the police and ambulance turned up			0
' the former garage owner had suffered excruciating nerve pain since he was in a motorbike accident when he was 28 years old			2
he was riding through @entity189 when a car came speeding around a corner and knocked him off , cracking a vertebrae in his neck , damaging his spine and shattering his clavicle			0
calm in a crisis : after the guillotine struck a blow he used a scalpel to separate it and then used bandages and cable ties to stem the flow of blood a piece of plastic became embedded in his arm , damaging nerves and condemning him to a lifetime of pain			2
@entity0 added : ' i 've been experiencing chronic pain ever since my accident but they refused to amputate because my hand is still useful ' i 've explained to doctors , psychologists and specialists that if this pain is n't stopped i would remove the limb myself			1
' i 'm still in a lot of pain			0
i knew it would still hurt above the elbow but without the hand they have have no excuse to keep the arm '			2
@entity0 's wife @entity58 , 43 , who has supported his efforts to have his arm surgically removed , told @entity231 : ' i knew he was up to something that day , but i thought he was planning a secret treat as a surprise			1
' when i came into the house and saw the blood everywhere i said " oh @entity239 - what have you done ? " i could n't believe it			0
' @entity28 and @entity241 said officers could do nothing to save the hand after being alerted to the self - mutilation at 1:40pm on march 17			1
in the past : @entity0 , aged 20 , on his wedding day shaking the hand of his best man			1
but his life changed after motorcycle accident eight years later where he suffered broken bones and nerve damage the @entity255 maintains it tries to avoid amputation if at all possible because it will not always remove pain			1
' we were very sorry to learn that mr @entity0 had amputated his hand			1
we will continue to support him through our orthopaedics and pain management services , ' a spokesman said			0
' it would be wrong of us to comment on the details of his specific case , as that would breach our duty of confidentiality			0
however , doctors always try to avoid amputation if they possibly can , particularly for patients with non-paralyzed limbs			0
' there is no evidence that amputation removes pain			2
in fact nerve pain is often generated in the spinal cord , rather than in the painful limb itself ; so for many people , the pain continues			0
they can also get phantom limb pain after amputation , and therefore may be in a worse situation than they were before ' .			2

@entity0 , 44 , used an axe , some springs and a gate post to cut it off
father - of - one from @entity28 says @entity12 has ignored his pleas for amputation
ten days ago sliced off hand and burnt it in bucket to stop reattachment
but pain he suffered remains and he has issued *deadline* for @entity12 surgery
' i 've told them that if nothing is done , i will take the arm off , ' he said
