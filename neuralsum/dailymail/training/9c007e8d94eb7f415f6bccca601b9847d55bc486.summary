' i am thrilled to be the @entity6 captain and represent our country as we work to win back the @entity3 , ' said @entity1			1
' it is a great honour to be in the position to help build the team , but our mission does n't end there			0
what we accomplish in 2016 at @entity5 must serve as the foundation for future @entity6 @entity3 teams			2
' as the son of a pga professional and representing all @entity0 members , i am very proud to accept this responsibility and eager to get started			0

' @entity1 was the skipper in 2012 when the @entity6 threw away a 10 - 4 lead on saturday afternoon to lose to @entity8 @entity1 was part of an 11 - man task force charged to look into all aspects of the @entity4 ' approach to the @entity3 after they suffered an eighth defeat in the last 10 contests in @entity62			1
the founding of the task force was sparked by @entity65 's public criticism of 2014 captain @entity66 immediately after the defeat in @entity62 @entity65 , who was left out of a full day 's play for the first time in his @entity3 career on the saturday , said : ' unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three @entity73 , and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			0
' that seemed to point to a second spell as captain for successful 2008 skipper @entity78 , with three - time @entity80 - winning captain @entity79 also a strong contender			0

@entity1 's first act as captain was to appoint @entity21 as one of his four vice-captains but @entity103 's inspired run of five consecutive birdies on saturday evening helped the @entity8 take the final two points of the day and eight and a half points from the 12 singles matches on sunday gave @entity110 's men a remarkable victory			1
@entity1 will go head - to - head with @entity113 , who was announced as @entity8 's captain last week ahead of @entity115 and @entity116			0
reports emerged before @entity113 's appointment that @entity1 was due to be handed a second chance at the captaincy and , speaking before the @entity4 decision was confirmed , @entity113 expressed his delight at the prospect of facing his friend			0
' if so that would be wonderful , ' he said			0
' we 've played many practice rounds together and are very good friends			0
he is a gentleman and there is n't a nicer man in our sport			0
