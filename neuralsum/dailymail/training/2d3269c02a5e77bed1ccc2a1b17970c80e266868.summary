by @entity0 the @entity2 has recognised a supposed miracle attributed to @entity4 and will beatify the late @entity6 pope in october , which would leave him one step from sainthood , a @entity2 source said today			1
@entity4 reigned between 1963 and 1978 and presided over key reforms from the @entity10			1
during his reign , he also survived an assassination attempt at @entity13 in 1970 by a @entity15 surrealist painter			0
miracles do happen : president @entity18 meeting pope @entity4 in @entity2 on his tour of @entity20 in 1963 pope @entity4 and @entity21 shake hands in this file photo during a private audience in @entity2 in 1973 the @entity6 news agency @entity25 reported that the apparent miracle identified by the @entity2 's @entity27 was the healing of an unborn baby from an otherwise incurable illness			1
@entity25 said the beatification could occur on october 19			1
two late popes , @entity33 and @entity34 , were given full sainthood in a @entity2 ceremony last month			1
@entity38 procedures require one miracle attributed for beatification , which confers the status of ' blessed ' on the person in question , and two miracles for canonisation to join the ranks of saints			1
@entity48 , flanked by @entity50 commander @entity49 , greets new @entity50 the day before their swearing - in ceremony , as he arrives to meet them in the @entity52 at the @entity2 yesterday pope @entity48 passes by a tapestry depicting late pope @entity33 as he leaves at the end of his weekly general audience , at the @entity2 the tapestry showing pope @entity34 during the canonisation mass of @entity58 @entity34 and @entity33 on @entity59 's at the @entity2 @entity4 was praised for his efforts to seek closer ties with other christian denominations but his 1968 encyclical @entity63 was controversial for spelling out a ban on all forms of artificial contraception			1
the application for beatification was begun in 1993			2
one million people fill @entity70 to witness @entity48 and retired @entity71 make saints of @entity34 and @entity33 last month the @entity2 's detailed process for making a saint usually starts in the diocese where the candidate lived or died			1
a postulator — essentially the cheerleader spearheading the project — gathers testimony and documentation to build the case and presents the report to the @entity2 's @entity27			2
if the congregation 's experts agree the candidate lived a virtuous life , the case is forwarded to the pope who signs a decree attesting to the candidate 's ' heroic virtues			0
' over time , the postulator may come across information that someone was miraculously healed by praying to the candidate			0
if , upon further investigation , the cure can not be medically explained , the case is presented to the congregation as the possible miracle needed for beatification			2
panels of doctors , theologians , bishops and cardinals must certify that the cure was instantaneous , complete and lasting — and was due to the intercession of the sainthood candidate			2
if convinced , the congregation sends the case to the pope who signs a decree saying the candidate can be beatified			0
a second miracle is needed for canonization			0
beatification allows for veneration of the candidate locally , say in a particular diocese or country			0
@entity122 allows for veneration throughout the universal church			0
martyrs , or people who were killed for their faith , get a free pass and can be beatified without a miracle			0
a miracle is needed , however , for martyrs to be canonized .			0
