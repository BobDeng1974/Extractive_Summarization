nearly two thirds of @entity1 think they would be better off if they had not swapped the @entity2 for the euro			1
this is the largest number ever to voice doubts on the single currency since it replaced the building bloc of the postwar ' economic miracle ' a decade ago			1
some 65 per cent of @entity1 thought their personal situation would be better if they still had the d - mark , compared to 36 per cent of @entity12 who miss the franc , according to the survey by @entity1 's @entity16 released on monday			1
financial fracas : @entity1 chancellor @entity18 spoke about a number of issues including the decreasing support of the @entity22 in her country as a new poll shows the majority of @entity1 feel they never should have switched currencies the @entity1 are also less attached to the @entity28 , suggested the poll , which was conducted july 3 to 8 in both countries			1
some 49 per cent of those @entity1 questioned said they would be personally better off if the @entity28 did not exist , compared to 34 per cent of @entity12 who said they would be better , or much better off without the @entity28			1
the poll , also carried out in @entity34 , showed only 28 per cent of @entity34 believed they would be better without the @entity28			2
nevertheless , despite their apparent skepticism about the euro on a personal level , 69 per cent of @entity1 said they believed the @entity28 was a model for the rest of the world , compared to 56 per cent of @entity12 and 59 per cent of @entity34			2
@entity1 has largely managed to ride out the recession that has engulfed most of the world due to its strong export market and solid industrial base			2
but the economy is now slowly heading south and , with no end in sight to the euro crisis , disillusion with the currency that their chancellor @entity18 has staked her career on is expected to grow			0
last week the country 's highest court green - lighted the bailout funds for the euro that will cost @entity1 taxpayers Â£ 151billion - 60 per cent of all tax revenues for this year			1
@entity63 over new : 60 per cent of @entity1 feel they would have been better off if they stuck with the @entity2 ( left ) rather than switching to the communal @entity22 ( right ) @entity1 who bought into the assurances that the euro was a strong currency that would be good for trade , good for banks , good for savings and would do away with pricey , pesky foreign exchange transactions when going on holiday to boot , now find themselves deeply disillusioned with it			1
only the political and banking elite are still fighting for it , believing its failure would be a failure of the entire @entity80 project			0
many experts believe it will still be @entity83 that rips the eurozone apart , despite the hundreds of billions in aid which has flooded into the country			0
@entity88 would be a tectonic shock to the euro zone from which it would probably not recover			0
the world economy would be plunged into turmoil and recession the like of which has not been seen since the great depression of the 1930 's			0
the so - called troika of the @entity98 , the @entity99 and the @entity100 has recently been intensely monitoring @entity83 efforts to make the cutbacks demanded of it for more aid			0
they have been severely disappointed at what has been achieved so far - just one third of savings targets reached in the past two years			0
if the @entity100 turns off the money tap , so will other countries like the @entity111 and @entity112 , who have linked their aid directly to the @entity100 .			0

65 per cent of @entity1 think the country should *n't* have switched from @entity2 to @entity22
highest - ever mark of *disapproval* of the single currency
