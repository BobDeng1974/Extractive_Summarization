by @entity1 reporter published : 22:22 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 16:11 est , 18 october 2012 fourteen lifeguards who were sacked for making a ' @entity4 ' spoof video at the @entity6 swimming pool where they worked have been rehired			1
the young workers , who are mostly students , lost their jobs last month after bosses at the @entity11 labelled their two - minute routine , which comprised synchronised swimming , complicated choregrography and plenty of hip - thrusting , ' inappropriate and disgusting			1
' but the lifeguards should soon be back at work after the @entity19 voted on tuesday to rehire the workers pending a review of the leisure centre 's management and procedures			1
the lifeguards clearly put a lot of work into the video , which was a spoof version of a @entity43 rapper ’s music clip			2
but their bosses did not appreciate their efforts and all 14 lifeguards were fired on september 5			2
titled @entity47 , the two - minute video is a parody of pop star @entity51 ’s @entity4 music video			1
it became the unexpected internet sensation of the summer , clocking up more than two million views on @entity55 in just three months			1
rocking it : titled @entity47 , the two - minute video is a parody of pop star @entity58 s @entity4 music video in the hilarious spoof , red swimsuit - clad lifeguards and their young male colleagues strut their stuff , mimic @entity51 's dance moves and rub sun cream into each other			1
one clip in the video shows a man straddling another male lifeguard in an elevator while giving some impressive hip thrusts			2
but rather than being amused or entertained by the film , the lifeguards ’ superiors ' said the entire video was inappropriate and disgusting , ' fired lifeguard @entity77 told @entity78			2
the city claim that the group were fired for using city property , the pool and their uniforms , for private use			1
all but one of the lifeguards are college students who were working at the pool to raise money before going back to school			1
disgusting ? rather than being amused or entertained by the film , bosses said the entire video was inappropriate and disgusting , according to a fired lifeguard desperate for their jobs back , the group set up a @entity98 page ' bring back the @entity11 14 , ' which has attracted more than 17,360 ' likes ' and they managed to get almost as many signatures on a petition			1
' we just felt it was really unfair and not really grounds for termination , ' former lifeguard @entity101 told @entity106			0
another fired lifeguard , @entity107 , told the tv station he was stunned when he heard the news			0
' i was in shock			0
because i really did n't think that it would escalate to termination , ' he said			0
' i loved what i did			0
i loved teaching the kids			0
i loved making sure everybody was safe			0
so i would never have wanted to hurt the pool in any way			0
this was just a fun thing to capture our memories with			0
' goofing around : all but one of the lifeguards are college students who were working at the pool to raise money before going back to school the @entity6 lifeguards ' jobs are no longer on shaky ground , and @entity51 ’s music career is similarly going from strength to strength			1
his music video , in which he performs his now signature horse riding move , became an internet hit attracting 117 million on @entity55 since its july release and @entity51 recently attended the @entity140 's			1
psy - real name @entity142 - was the first @entity43 artist to be invited to the industry event since 2005			0
his undeniably catchy song was meant as a commentary on the rampant materialism and emphasis on appearance of today 's @entity150 - particularly in relation to @entity4 , which @entity51 terms @entity153 's @entity152			0
while @entity51 has won millions of @entity55 hits , the lifeguards ' spoof video has impressively garnered more than 74,000			2
star : @entity51 performs some of his famous moves at the @entity140 's in @entity159 on september 6 and host @entity160 can not help joining in video : lifeguard 's @entity4 remake : video : @entity164 on global success :			0
