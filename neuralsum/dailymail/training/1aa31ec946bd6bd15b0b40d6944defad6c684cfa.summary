a strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in @entity3 can mutate to become resistant to antiviral drugs , say @entity3 researchers			0
@entity7 doctors treating 14 sufferers of the @entity10 virus found that it had become resistant to @entity12 in three of the patients			1
researchers at the @entity15 said that while the drug reduced levels of the virus in 11 of the patients , genetic testing of bird flu in the three who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively mutate to resist @entity12			1
resistant : three @entity7 sufferers of a strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in @entity3 have shown resistance to antiviral drugs such as @entity12 ( pictured ) they even believe that resistance in at least one of the patients was a direct result of the presence of @entity12			1
such drugs , known as neuraminidase inhibitors , are the only known way to treat @entity10			2
scientists say that they are concerned by the results of their investigation even though flu viruses have been known to mutate			0
the researchers said in @entity42 : ' the apparent ease with which antiviral resistance emerges in @entity10 viruses is concerning , it needs to be closely monitored and considered in future pandemic response plans			1
' all 14 of the patients tested had pneumonia and were placed on ventilation to keep them from dying			0
the team found traces of @entity10 in patients ' urine , blood and stools indicating that the virus is not just spread through respiratory secretions as previously thought			1
precautions : an employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity3 , last month drugs such as @entity12 do not cure the virus but can make the illness less severe and make recovery quicker			2
overall , there have been 131 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since the first cases of the virus emerged earlier this year			1
there have been no new cases of the infection since may 8			0
@entity78 experts claimed last week that the outbreak of the latest strain of bird flu has hit the @entity3 economy to the tune of $ 6.5billion , according to @entity84			0
pictures emerged earlier this month of chicken farmers resorting to killing off newborn chicks by plunging them in boiling water as they faced official demands to dispose of as many birds as possible			0
new strain : researchers found that the virus effectively mutated to resist treatment in three of 14 cases ( file picture ) the @entity98 - based @entity97 ( @entity97 ) had said it had no evidence that the new strain of bird flu , which was first detected in patients in @entity3 in march , is easily transmissible between humans			2
@entity3 scientists confirmed at the beginning of may that the @entity10 strain has been transmitted to humans from chickens			2
but the @entity97 has said around 40 per cent of people infected with @entity10 appear to have had no contact with poultry .			0

@entity7 doctors treated 14 h7n9 sufferers with @entity12 drug
the virus showed resistance to drug in three of the sufferers
there have been 131 confirmed cases of the virus this year
but no new cases of @entity10 have emerged since may 8
