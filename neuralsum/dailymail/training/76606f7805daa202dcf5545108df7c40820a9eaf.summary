@entity0 and @entity2 boss @entity1 would not have a problem working together , according to @entity5 star @entity4			1
@entity0 has been continually linked with a move away from @entity7 after rumours of a rift with boss @entity10 , but despite hearsay of a possible move to @entity2 among others , @entity11 expects the 27 - year - old to stay put in the @entity17 capital			1
however , the former @entity19 winger , who worked under @entity1 at the @entity20 , was confident that compatriot and fellow @entity22 international @entity0 would fit in well if he were ever to switch the @entity23 for @entity24			1
@entity4 ( left ) said @entity0 would fit in well if he ever worked with @entity2 boss @entity1 ' in principle , i do n’t think @entity27 wants to leave @entity7			1
it ’s hard to walk away from a club that ’s given you everything , where you effectively grew up			2
' but no i do n’t think he ’d have any problem working with @entity1 , ' he said			1
after @entity5 's frustrated performance against @entity36 on sunday , boss @entity34 was widely criticised for not utilising @entity11 to his full potential as a pacy wide man			1
but the 26 - year - old admitted he is enjoying his time in @entity41 since he made his £ 60million move from @entity19 to @entity43			0
@entity11 joined @entity34 's @entity5 for £ 60m last summer and is enjoying life in @entity41 ' the weather is the only thing [ i do n't like ] … it does n’t help a lot			1
but i ’m very content here			0
' the people have a lot of affection for me , which is the most important thing			0
it ’s what i value most , and i have that here '			0
when quizzed about his progress in learning @entity57 , the @entity55 - born winger spoke with slightly less optimism			2
' it ’s very bad			0
[ i ’ve learned ] very little and only understand a small bit			0
that said , i ’m trying to learn it bit by bit and i ’m taking classes			2
hopefully i ’ll pick it up quickly , ' he admitted			0
the former @entity19 winger ( second right ) compared @entity7 's @entity0 ( left ) and @entity69 ( front ) unperturbed by the prospect of sounding like a broken record , the @entity71 was asked if he minded having to make constant comparisons of @entity0 and @entity69 , the latter with whom he played alongside in the whites of @entity19			1
' no , because i always say the same thing : that they 're two completely different players , ' he remarked			0
' @entity27 features in every game , making short bursts and nonchalantly dribbling past one , two or three players with great ball control in tight spaces			0
@entity69 is more about power and long range shots			2
' if i were @entity88 , i 'd have two @entity90 prizes ; one for that pair to fight over and another for everyone else			2

@entity11 said he could see @entity0 and @entity1 getting on
the @entity5 star also said he is struggling to learn @entity57
@entity4 *suggested* a separate @entity90 award *excluding* @entity0 and @entity69
