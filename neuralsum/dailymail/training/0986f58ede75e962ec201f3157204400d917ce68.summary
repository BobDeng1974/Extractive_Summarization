by @entity0 could free @entity1 ? hard as it is to believe , when @entity4 walks out at @entity5 on sunday , he may only have three more league games remaining in a @entity8 shirt			1
@entity4 , 33 , can leave on a free transfer at the end of the season and @entity8 have only offered him a one - year deal , in line with club policy for senior players			1
perhaps they take him for granted and expect him to stay , regardless of the reduction in terms			2
he has enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career , so these tactics by @entity8 are a dangerous game of risk			1
if they could pull it off , they get to weaken one of their rivals and they end up with @entity4 and @entity42 in a mighty partnership			1
it would take a minimum two - year contract to drag @entity4 from @entity32 , where you can imagine he would ideally like to finish his career as a one - club player			1
i ca n’t see him leaving , but i can see @entity34 — who have tried to sign him before — enjoying the mischief			1
@entity4 in another club ’s shirt seems unimaginable ... or does it ? @entity56 's protest line - up on the matter of @entity8 , i wonder what team @entity58 will take to @entity5 on sunday ? he wanted the game to be played on a saturday , but the @entity61 said no. the game is sandwiched between the two legs of the @entity65 semi-final and with @entity8 five points adrift after losing to @entity31 , maybe he will prioritise @entity67			1
that will hardly bring cheer to @entity34			1
unhappy : @entity58 wanted @entity8 's game at @entity71 to be played on a saturday wonder of @entity72 @entity72 has to be the player of the week , with three goals in matches against @entity61 heavyweights			1
blow : @entity72 scores at @entity32 to damage their @entity61 title hopes @entity72 is the only opposition player to have scored at both the @entity80 and @entity32 this season			2
before then , he had scored only once in 37 @entity61 games , but i ’ve always liked the look of him since he came through at @entity85			2
a spell at @entity87 on loan this season brought a return of no goals in five games but @entity93 has gambled with him and those goals this week have given @entity31 hope			2
can @entity72 continue at home against @entity97 next sunday ? @entity98 we began the early part of the season raving about @entity102 but @entity103 is the bright , explosive young talent now			1
he ’s learning still , but he is robust , powerful and direct and rather than debate whether he should be on the plane for @entity107 , i say he should be in the @entity109 team			1
magic : @entity103 scored two goals for @entity71 in their victory at @entity113 rising star : @entity103 has been a revelation under @entity116 and should be on the plane to @entity107 on target : @entity103 has scored nine goals for @entity71 in their push for the @entity61 title where @entity116 has done brilliantly is by moving him in from the wing and playing him at the point of a diamond			1
can @entity125 find a similar place for him ? will he be bold enough to give @entity103 such licence ? it seems a waste to have him chasing attacking full backs out on the flanks			1
@entity132 , @entity133 what a week it was for @entity135 , but he ’s not the only @entity136 catching the eye			2
it ’s great to see @entity139 back for @entity140			1
he ’s the only midfielder they have who will run forward without the ball and his absence through injury has seen them tumble down the league and out of @entity67			2
@entity140 might still be in the title race had he been fit			1
that ’s how important he has become			2
he ran 7.9 miles against @entity150 , more than anyone else on the pitch			0
high flying : @entity139 returned to scoring ways for @entity140 after his injury in their win at @entity150 united learn a harsh lesson when i joined @entity71 in 1991 , i ’d have laughed if you ’d said they would go so long without winning the title			1
but they are the perfect example of how things can go very wrong very quickly			0
@entity165 are now finding that out			0
last season they won the league by 11 points , now they are 23 points behind the leaders			0
the players look unhappy with @entity174 — they are not performing for him			0
it is a real worry and he needs to get them motivated fast			0
@entity177 : @entity178 beat @entity165 2 - 0 at @entity179 to boost their top four hopes welcome back : @entity174 endured a miserable return to @entity179 , where he managed for 11 years @entity174 is clearly a good manager but the move is not working out for him and only the club hierarchy know whether he will be given time to turn things round			1
@entity165 have the reputation of being a club who do n’t sack their managers			0
that is because they had someone in sir @entity193 who was winning trophies			0
now that philosophy will be tested more than ever			0
@entity71 chopped and changed managers so many times and it got them nowhere			1
now that is @entity165 ’s quandary : keep the faith and let @entity174 overhaul his declining squad , or give up			0
you 're not a-loan , @entity203 @entity204 , my @entity205 colleague , is firm in his views on loans			0
i share some of his concerns , because i too believe the system is open to abuse			0
@entity8 ’s @entity212 goalkeeper playing against them in the @entity65 is farcical , as was @entity71 ’s @entity213 scoring @entity31 ’s winner against @entity8 on saturday			1
however , i do n’t believe they should be outlawed altogether			0
favour : @entity71 loanee @entity213 scored the winner for @entity31 at @entity8 my rule would be that under 21 players only can be loaned as it performs a key part of their development			1
@entity221 , @entity222 , @entity102 , @entity223 and @entity224 are all examples of that			0
43 - @entity227 now has 43 @entity61 assists for @entity228 , just one behind @entity229 , who had 44 , but still has some way to go to match the record of 67 by @entity232			0
11 - @entity71 have only once before won 11 league games in a row in a single season			2
the last time was between march and may in the 1981 - 82 season , when they won the title			0
3 - @entity240 became the first @entity228 player since @entity135 in may 2013 to score in three consecutive @entity61 games for the club			2
@entity61 top scorers 1 - @entity246 midfielder @entity245 has provided just one assist in his last 16 @entity61 appearances			0
he has nine goals for the season			0
1962 - @entity97 have not managed back - to - back top - flight wins since april 1962 , when they beat @entity251 3 - 2 and @entity252 3 - 0			2
saturday ’s draw with @entity254 means @entity97 are without a win in eight against them in all competitions			0
45 - @entity258 has averaged a header at goal every 45 minutes in the league this season , a more prolific rate than any other player			0
12 - @entity265 has scored 12 goals for @entity8 , and all of them have come at @entity32			2
7 - @entity254 have conceded seven penalties this season — a joint league - high with @entity270 .			0

@entity4 will be out of contract at @entity8 in the *summer*
the @entity8 *captain* is an *attractive* free agent for @entity34
@entity58 could play a weakened team at @entity5 on sunday
can @entity109 find a central role for @entity103 like @entity71 have ?
it 's good to see @entity139 back and on the score sheet for @entity140
