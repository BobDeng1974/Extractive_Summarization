' the advertising slogans coupled with the imagery that has been used across the campaign , are popular anglicised @entity76 phrases which are fun play - on words , ' he said			1
' the @entity78 campaign aims to embody the traditions of @entity69 which is about a celebratory occasion and enjoyable time spent with friends			2
' ms @entity37 said that the @entity6 , along with other establishments which the @entity84 owns , including the @entity85 , has a history of creating sexist and objectifying advertisements			2

# beer ” and reinforced by outdoor advertisements			0

if that is the attitude you wish have about your restaurant , then i wont be visiting it again ! @entity145 ! ' posted one social media user after the image was posted onto the @entity148			0
one @entity103 user uploaded a photo of the current ' @entity49 ' advertisement after spotting it on the back of a bus			2
' i 'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless , ' the social media user joked			0
according the @entity160 code , advertisers are prohibited from presenting men or women in a way that is sexually ' exploitative and degrading '			0

the @entity160 dismissed the complaint due to the ' ambiguity ' of the claim that the man was shown to be staring at the woman 's breasts , but ruled that the advertisement emphasised the woman 's breasts and ' this did objectify the woman '			2
' i 'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless , ' a social media user joked when he posted this image to @entity103 after spotting the ad on the back of a bus ' viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015 , ' said ms @entity37 the @entity6 responded to the claims and said that ' the last impression we want to give is that you can come to our restaurant and stare at our waitresses ' breasts , and we have very strict house rules for anyone in our restaurant exhibitingoffensive behaviour			2
' however , ms @entity37 said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments			0

“ very nice jugs ” … “ this is what you will see on saturday night big ass “ beers ” ca n’t wait " , ' she said			0
in 2013 , the @entity84 released an ad for @entity69 , which is held in both the @entity6 and the @entity85 each year			1
the clip depicts ' @entity68 beauties training for @entity69 ' , clad in short shorts and crop tops as they run along the beach and the camera pans up and down the women 's bodies			1
' viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015			0
there is a growing awareness in the community that sexual objectification and sexist attitudes underpin the epidemic of violence against women in @entity241 , ' ms @entity37 said			0
ms @entity37 said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments the @entity160 advised that the @entity85 removed the above ad after it was slammed for sexually objectifying women and comparing them to pieces of meat ' the @entity84 and associated restaurants need to get out of the dark ages and start treating women and girls with the respect they deserve			1
' last year , the @entity85 was forced to remove their campaign advertising their new range of ribs , after the ads were attacked for objectifying women			1
the @entity160 advised that the cafe removed the ads , which depicted a fully clothed man with two women in low cut dresses on either side , in front of a rack of ribs with the slogan ' we 've got the best racks '			1
the cafe claimed that for every serving of the ribs sold , the company would donate $ 1 to @entity276 , a group which raises money for breast reconstruction for women who have suffered through breast cancer			2
' women are literally being referred to as a piece of meat , ' ms @entity37 said			0
' the ad is inviting us to judge women by the quality of their breasts			0
it 's bad enough that there is an opinion in the general community that this is what women are worth , but to link it to a breast cancer charity is just another layer of objectification			0
