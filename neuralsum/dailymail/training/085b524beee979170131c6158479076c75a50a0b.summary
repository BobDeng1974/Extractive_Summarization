by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 21:01 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:33 est , 16 december 2013 pensioners could be forced to spend £ 150,000 of their own money before receiving any government help with care bills , it emerged today			1
the elderly would still face huge bills for residential care despite the government 's plan to cap costs at £ 72,000			2
@entity13 claimed its calculations showed that many people will die before reaching the cap , but ministers insisted it was taking much action which @entity13 failed to take when in power			1
costs : elderly people will have to fund tens of thousands of pounds in charges which are not covered by the government 's car cap the planned cap does not cover accommodation and living expenses which pensioners would still have to pay while care costs only count towards the limit at the rate the local council would pay for a place in a residential home			1
@entity13 says it will take almost five years for elderly people to hit the cap - during which time they will have clocked up more than £ 150,000 for their actual residential care home bill			1
the cap is due to come in from 2016 - 17 , when councils will charge an average of £ 522 - a - week for residential care is estimated to be £ 522 a week			2
but the average price of a care home bed will be £ 610 a week , creating an £ 88 - a - week shortfall which people will have to pay themselves			1
pensioners in care homes will also have to pay £ 230 a week for their accommodation , which is counted separately from care costs and does not count towards the cap			0
in some areas of the country with higher average care home costs , people could face paying more than £ 500,000 before the cap was reached			1
health minster @entity58 dismissed @entity13 's complaints , arguing they failed to act when in power in parts of @entity63 a bed in a standard residential care home typically costs around £ 800 a week , but local council rates are around £ 326 a week			1
the difference would mean a resident must spend more than £ 560,000 over 12 years before seeing costs capped			0
@entity13 also estimated that six out of seven elderly people will have died before they reach the cap			2
shadow minister for care and older people @entity75 told the @entity76 : ‘ @entity77 has repeatedly claimed that no - one will have to pay more than £ 72,000 to pay for their care , but this simply is n't the case			0
‘ on average , pensioners will have to pay more than twice this amount , and the vast majority will have died before they hit the so - called ' cap '			0
‘ @entity77 should be straight with elderly people about what they will really have to pay for their care			0
families deserve to be told the facts , rather than being conned , so they can properly plan for the future , and not have the @entity92 attempt to pull the wool over their eyes			0
’ but health minister @entity58 hit out at @entity13 's inaction on tackling the problem of crippling care costs while they were in power			0
the care and support minister said : ‘ it 's rank hypocrisy for @entity13 to criticise the coalition 's care cap when they did nothing to fix an unfair social care system in 13 years of plenty			2
‘ at the same time as dealing with @entity13 's debts , we have gone further than they ever did and found £ 2 billion to cap care costs and end the scandal of people being forced to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care			1
‘ of course we would love to be able to afford to go further , but we wo n't take any lectures from the party who racked up a record budget deficit and forced old people to sell their homes to pay for care .			0

ministers have *pledged* to *introduce* a £ *72k* ' cap ' on care home bills
but ' cost of living items ' such as food and *utility* bills are not *included*
@entity13 say thousands of people could die before getting any help
