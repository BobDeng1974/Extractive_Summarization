by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 20 february 2013 if you do n't like being left alone with the kids , spare a thought for this very modern male fish who is left to look after its babies - in its mouth			1
the cardinal fish is a mouthbrooder , where the males carry all the eggs in their mouth for weeks , unable even to eat until they have hatched			1
every few minutes the fish spits some of the eggs out to move them around before sucking them back in but lucky photographer @entity17 was there to see some of them actually hatch			2
' located underneath rocks the cardinal fish hides to hatch out its eggs and this fish was no exception , ' he said			1
' i have been taking underwater photos at the site both during the day and night and this was the first time i ever came across a cardinal fish with eggs ready to hatch			1
' i thought to myself " what a great find " so i settled on the sand and watched this little fish			0
' i saw every so often it would spit out the eggs and suck them back in and a few eggs floated off and i then saw these eggs had tails and were hatching			0
i was very excited to find this and be able to capture the moment			0
' ready to pop : mr @entity17 , 51 , a retired policeman from the @entity57 , took the shots on a night dive at @entity34 , @entity35 in @entity36 @entity60 : females release an egg mass close to the chosen male after the he fertilises the eggs , he will take them into his mouth to carry them during the incubation period , until the fry are ready to hatch normally the female will release an egg mass close to the chosen male and after the male fertilises the eggs , he will take them into his mouth to carry them during the incubation period , until the fry are ready to hatch			1
as he incubates the eggs the male cardinal fish will open its mouth to rotate the egg mass from time to time , to keep them clean and aerated			1
at times it will partially expel the eggs before sucking them back in			0
it is estimated that up to 30 per cent of the eggs are accidentally eaten			0
under threat : the cardinal fish could be vulnerable to global warming			2
hotter seas are killing off coral and higher water temperatures mean they need to breathe more - difficult when your mouth is completely full of eggs despite using this method of breeding for the past 50 million years , the @entity94 could be vulnerable to global warming			2
they tend to stay in the same place under corals , but warming seas are killing off and bleaching the coral			0
on top of this , increasing water temperatures mean they need to breathe more ; difficult when your mouth is completely full of eggs .			0

cardinal fish are mouthbrooders , where males carry eggs in their mouth
they incubate the eggs for weeks , unable to eat until they are hatched
these pictures were captured by former @entity57 policeman @entity17
he *spotted* the male fish ' giving birth ' on a night - dive in @entity35
