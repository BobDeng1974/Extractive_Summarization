when police came to the door of @entity4 's suburban family home in @entity5 , seven years ago she refused to believe what they were telling her			1
they broke the news that her partner , @entity9 , 43 , who had said goodbye to her and their four children on his way to work that morning , had killed himself			1
recalling that terrible day , @entity4 , now 51 , told @entity13 : ' it seemed like i was having open heart surgery without anaesthetic			1
i was hysterical , crying , my body was shaking and nothing was helping me deal with this grief			0
@entity4 with partner @entity9 who took his own life when she was 43 after suffering from depression following @entity9 's death , @entity4 , centre , was left to raise their four children , @entity27 , then 17 , @entity29 then 10 , @entity28 , then aged seven and @entity30 , then six ' i could not believe the love of my life was gone			1
i could not believe he had done it			0
' @entity9 had been suffering from depression and @entity4 said he had been under a lot of pressure in his job as an estate agent			1
she said : ' he was a manger and had a lot of responsibility			0
he was really stressed and really suffering			2
it had all got on top of him			0
' we had tried to sort it out over the years before he died , but he did keep how bad it was from me			0
' when the day came that the police knocked on my door to tell me he had taken his own life , i was gobsmacked			2
i know because he loved us so much , he did n't want us to know how much pain he was in			2
' @entity4 , who was 44 when @entity9 died , was left to raise their four children , @entity27 , then 17 , @entity29 then 10 , @entity28 , then aged seven and @entity30 , then six			1
@entity4 , now 51 , left , was helped through her grief by @entity55 , right , who had also lost her husband ' it has been very hard - i have been a double parent , mum and dad in every aspect of their lives , ' @entity4 said			1
' from schooling and homework to taking @entity30 to football , keeping the house going – it has been extremely hard but do - able			0
' with my sense of humour and determination , i was going to let this bring me down			0
it is still difficult , we have our ups and downs just like any normal family			0
' the first hurdle @entity4 had to overcome was explaining to her youngest children the loss of their father when they were too young to understand the mental turmoil he had been in			1
' i 'll always remember what @entity30 said to me			0
he was only six at the time and he asked me if he had anything wrong			0
i told him , " no , you did n't do anything wrong , and neither did daddy "			2
' he did he best to conquer it , he did what he could			0
i did think , " why does he want to leave us ? " , but i knew in the end that he just could n't carry on anymore			1
' @entity9 and @entity4 had been teenage sweethearts after meeting at a nightclub and she was devastated by the loss of her long - term partner and best friend			1
@entity4 and @entity55 set up the drop in @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity5 , to help others @entity102 , pictured , and @entity55 have been given awards for their charity work which is supported by @entity105 she went through the motions of looking after the children but inside she was suffering intense pain and grief			1
the dental nurse was prescribed three different types of pills by her gp and went to counselling sessions to help her try and come to terms with her loss and deal with her feelings of despair			2
but it was only after meeting @entity55 , whose husband had also recently died , that she began to realise the value of talking to people who have been through bereavement themselves			2
describing their first meeting , @entity4 said : ' it was so nice to speak to someone who was going through the same as me , she had lost her husband too			2
' we got strength from each other			0
we would speak every day and check up on each other			0
' the pair realised that other people who had lost loved ones could gain the same support from others if only they knew where to turn			1
' we decided there were not enough services out there for @entity135 , and that people with knowledge of dealing with bereavement should share it , ' @entity4 said			1
so they set up the drop in @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity5 with the help of cash raised through @entity105			1
@entity102 said @entity9 - pictured with her when they were in their late thirties - was the love of her life and she will always miss him the centre offers an alternative to the clinical style setting of @entity159 bereavement counselling services			1
they provide yoga , reiki and reflexology as well as grief counselling and expert advice with a warm welcome , tea and biscuits and a relaxing garden that is tended by one of its service users			0
now seven years on , the centre is thriving and has helped many people deal with the loss of a love one			1
@entity4 said : ' we just thought if we can help just one person , then we can change a life			1
we have a waiting list of people who want to see us			0
people come to see us from all over			0
we know we are doing the right thing running the centre and we know it works			0
' people tell us how much it helps them and we would love to see more bereavement centres like ours around the country			0
i still need support myself and get that at the centre			2
@entity102 and @entity55 have helped many people deal with grief thanks to their drop in centre @entity4 said she has learnt to coped with @entity9 's death thanks to her sense of humour , determination and the support she has received from friends like @entity55 she added : ' everybody is going to go through bereavement			1
but it 's too big a thing to do on your own and you need to speak to someone who has gone through it and can teach you the tools of how to cope			0
' @entity4 and her children , now aged 25 , 18 , 15 and 14 , will always miss @entity9 and the centre has been a big help to them			1
@entity4 said : ' the children found it very hard but are coping very well but they did , and still do get , frustrated at times that they have n’t got a dad to turn			1
' as they grow older there are things that they would have wanted to ask their dad to help with or for advice on – even things like getting a mortgage - they would have asked their dad about			0
' @entity9 will be missed forever			2
when you lose someone you truly love you will always miss them but you learn to live and cope			2
