by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 14 february 2013 a @entity2 crackdown on tax credit fraud and error missed its target ' by a mile ' , as tax bosses failed to stop losses of more than £ 850 million			1
despite instigating a plan to tackle inefficiencies , error was still rife in the taxation system throughout 2010/11 as £ 2.27 billion was lost			2
watchdogs criticised the failed approach , demanding that tax bosses ' get a grip ' and saying that the money could have been spent on ' schools and hospitals '			1
inefficiencies : despite instigating a plan to tackle inefficiencies , £ 2.27billion was lost in 2010/11 due to tax credit error and fraud there was also criticism of the system as it was revealed that the majority of the loss was due to error rather than fraud			1
@entity2 had hoped to reduce losses by £ 1.4 billion in 2010/11 but was only able to reduce the total by £ 500million , despite deploying 400 staff to address systematic problems			1
while it was hoped that error and fraud rates would be cut from nine per cent to five per cent , the push only resulted in a decrease to 8.1 per cent			2
action : @entity38 , chair of the commons public accounts committee , demanded that senior officials resolve the ' deeply worrying ' issues one fifth of all claims , an estimated 1.4 million , still resulted in people being overpaid			1
the @entity45 said that there had been ' little progress ' in dealing with people failing to declare partners ' income or in checking claimants ' stated work and hours			0
the two areas accounted for £ 1 billion of the fraud and error in 2010/11 while £ 640 million was down to children being wrongly included in claims			2

@entity61 mp @entity38 said : ' it set itself a target , which it missed by a mile			0
in 2010/11 error and fraud was still at 8.1 % with £ 2.27 billion lost to the taxpayer - £ 850 million higher than expected and money that could have been spent on our schools and hospitals			2
' according to @entity2 's own figures , the majority of this £ 2.27 billion - £ 1.6 billion - was due to error rather than fraud by claimants			0
she added : ' i also find it deeply worrying that even after @entity2 has taken action , one in five claims still contain error or fraud			1
' mrs @entity38 did draw attention to some signs of improvement , noting that @entity2 had ' tried to be smarter and sharper '			0
but she said there was ' little progress ' elsewhere , adding : ' @entity2 needs to develop a rigorous plan for rooting out error and fraud in each and every category if it is to achieve a sustainable reduction in losses			0
' it needs to inject much more rigour into its collection and analysis of data , particularly around changes in claimants ' circumstances , where mistakes are most likely to be made			0
' @entity2 had hoped to reduce losses by £ 1.4 billion in 2010/11 but was only able to prevent £ 500million , despite deploying 400 staff to address systematic problems mrs @entity38 warned @entity2 not to ' take its eye off the ball ' , despite the fact that tax credits are to be replaced by a new universal credit			1
tax credit payments are based on estimates of income - which critics say leaves the system ' wide open to abuse '			0
@entity2 estimates that up to £ 4 billion of tax credit debt is unlikely ever to be recovered and has already been forced to write - off large sums			2
@entity45 head @entity116 , who last year declined to sign off @entity2 's accounts because of tax credit fraud and error , said it faced ' significant challenges '			1
' the tax credit system is complicated , and @entity2 will have to overcome significant challenges if it is going to achieve value for money			0
' @entity2 deserves credit for demonstrating innovation , but it has further to go to achieve sustainable reductions in tax credits error and fraud			0
' to tackle error and fraud effectively , there needs to be an improved understanding of risks and better use of information			0
