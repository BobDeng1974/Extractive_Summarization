redditor user bordss posted ' only to @entity2 ? when is this coming to @entity4 ? ' mr @entity6 's response was simple : ' when you take @entity9 back '			1
the @entity0 president 's partaking in the @entity40 is just the latest move in the fast food chain 's outreach to promote their new menu			0
earlier this week , @entity0 begun airing ads thursday that feature everyday men who happen to have the same name as their main competitor @entity49 - @entity19			0
action required : @entity6 , who took part in a reddit @entity40 under the name @entity53 laid down the law with @entity4 fans high numbers : mr @entity6 also revealed that the sales increase in @entity27 since the legalization of marijuana was 420 per cent , a term which refers to the consumption of cannabis or approval of marijuana culture @entity0 found around 400 men and women with the name @entity19 , @entity68 or some variation			1
a few dozen were selected to represent different regions around the country including @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 ; @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity81			0
the men show their approval of the food with comments like , ' it 's not messy ' and ' mmm , wow ' and ' mmm , real good ' and ' it has everything i like			0

' @entity19 : @entity0 's ad campaign to promote its new breakfast menu includes more than 400 men named @entity19 disclaimer : in the ad , @entity0 offers a disclaimer saying ' these @entity19 's are not affiliated with @entity96 ' better than the golden arches ? a @entity19 in @entity112 , @entity111 takes a bite out of a @entity0 waffle taco the chain , owned by @entity116 of @entity117 , @entity118 , is looking to boost sales by opening most of its roughly 6,000 @entity2 stores a few hours earlier at 7am starting this week			1

the popularity of @entity127 and other items have been a consistent sales driver for @entity19 's over the years , with breakfast accounting for about 20 per cent of the company 's @entity2 sales			2
by comparison , a @entity116 executive has said that breakfast accounted for just 4 per cent of sales when it was being tested at @entity0 stores in select markets			0
that was before national marketing began , however , and @entity0 president @entity6 said in a phone interview that the goal was to get the figure to a level ' much greater than that			0
