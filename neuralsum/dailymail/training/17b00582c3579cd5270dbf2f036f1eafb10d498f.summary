@entity0 begins the most crucial week yet in the battle for @entity3 ’s future – without the hoped - for @entity5 ‘ bounce ’ in favour of independence			1
three days before mr @entity0 ’s live tv debate with anti-independence campaign leader @entity9 , a poll for @entity11 revealed no boost for the ‘ yes ’ campaign from the @entity5 in @entity14			1
the @entity16 survey , the first of @entity3 voters to be conducted since the @entity5 began , puts the ‘ yes ’ vote on 40 per cent – down one point on last month – and ‘ no ’ unchanged on 46 per cent			1
the outcome will be a bitter disappointment for @entity3 nationalists , who had hoped that scheduling the independence referendum on september 18 on the back of the @entity5 would lead to a surge of votes to break up the @entity28			1
but the survey does show that @entity3 first minister mr @entity0 is a clear favourite to win tuesday night ’s debate – the first head - to - head contest between the two campaign leaders			2
the charismatic @entity3 @entity53 leader is backed by 37 per cent of voters to come out on top , with barely one in ten predicting that dour ex-labour cabinet minister mr @entity9 will triumph			0
the result will heap pressure on mr @entity9 , the chairman of the anti-independence better together campaign , who faced criticism that he is too lacklustre to take on ‘ showman ’ mr @entity0			0
opponents : @entity0 ( left ) wants an independent @entity3 while @entity64 ( right ) wants a @entity32 the televised debate , before a studio audience of 300 drawn from ‘ yes ’ , ‘ no ’ and undecided voters , is seen as crucial if mr @entity0 is to overhaul a stubborn anti-independence lead in the polls			1
yesterday , it emerged that mr @entity0 has been having performance lessons from a lifestyle coach ahead of the showdown			0
but in an article for @entity11 @entity75 , the mp for @entity76 , backs mr @entity9 to present the ‘ clear , unvarnished ’ case for staying in the @entity28 , in contrast to the ‘ verbal acrobatics ’ of mr @entity0			0
@entity80 has faced criticism for refusing to take on the first minister himself in a tv debate			0
and the poll reveals nearly half of @entity3 voters brand the prime minister a coward			1
@entity75 , the mp for @entity76 , backs mr @entity9 to present the ‘ clear , unvarnished ’ case for staying in the @entity28 however , more than one in three agree that he was sensible to leave mr @entity9 – as a @entity91 – to tackle mr @entity0			0
the @entity16 poll found that more than 80 per of voters say the @entity5 have made no difference to how they were likely to vote			2
only 12 per cent said they were more likely to vote ‘ yes ’ , with some voters ( 7 per cent ) even saying it would actually make them more inclined to vote against independence			2
a spokesman for the @entity101 campaign said the poll was ‘ very encouraging ’ and matched evidence that the result was too close to call			0
a spokesman for mr @entity0 said : ‘ this poll makes clear that @entity3 believe @entity80 is afraid to take part in a debate with the first minister			2

first poll of @entity3 voters conducted since the @entity5 began puts ‘ yes ’ vote on 40 **%** – down one point on last month
those in favour of keeping the @entity32 remain static on 46 **%**
nationalists hoped @entity5 would lead to surge of @entity121 votes
