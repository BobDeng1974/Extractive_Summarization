a @entity1 electronics company has unveiled a 13ft super-robot which can be controlled by an @entity3			1
but be careful with the jokes if you are on the phone to the pilot as the robot , made by @entity9 in @entity10 , brings a whole new meaning to ‘ trigger - happy ’			2
' @entity12 ' is fitted with a futuristic weapons system , including a gatling gun capable of shooting 6,000 bb bullets a minute , which fires when the pilot smiles			1
transformers assemble : the 13ft , four ton , super-robot is going on sale for £ 900,000 - but you have to pay extra for the cup holder @entity12 , made by @entity9 , can be controlled either through the one - man cockpit or from the outside using any smartphone connected to the 3g network			1
the robot , which is set will go on sale for £ 900,000 , has around 30 hydraulic joints which the pilot moves using motion control			1
as it is made to order the style conscious buyer will not have to worry about sticking to the grey exterior - it comes in 16 colours , including black and pink , and for an extra £ 60 they will sort you out with a cup holder			0
simple touch : all you need to remote control the robot is a 3g connection and works particularly well with @entity3 's touchscreen you can also use the @entity46 control system where you move a tiny version of the @entity12 - with an iphone strapped to its back - to get the life - sized one to follow your bidding engineers @entity52 and @entity53 were saluted in front of @entity12 together with their pilot @entity55 when they showcased the robot at the @entity58 in @entity59 , suburban @entity10 earlier today			1
the team have been working on the robot since 2010			0
the company also released a video where very attractive @entity55 gives step by step instructions of how to operate the @entity12			0
rush hour : if you have grown weary of a traditional commute @entity12 is fully functioning on the road - but will not get you to work any faster as its top speed barely hits 7 mph the video reminds the viewer of the security instructions on an airplane with @entity55 taking on the role as futuristic airhostess			2
if you are not the piloting kind of millionaire , @entity12 can be operated using what @entity78 calls the ‘ master - slave system ’ where you control the robot ’s movements from outside using any device with a 3g network such as an @entity3			1
‘ automatic alignment allows you to lock on your enemy target			0
@entity12 will not allow any targets to escape			0
' with the alignment set appropriately the system will fire bbs when the pilot smiles			2
’ pilot @entity55 is set to enter the robot 's cockpit and poses with the two men behind it : @entity52 , left and @entity53 after whom the robot has been named female ' pilot ' @entity55 looks out the cockpit of @entity12 - with onlookers breathing a sigh of relief at the stern look on her face as the trigger for the heavy artillery is a smile realising that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire , the video warns the pilot against smiling too much whilst operating the @entity12 weaponry			1
@entity115 is 13ft tall and weighs four tons – not including the pilot			0
the four wheeled legs ensures that it is easy to transport and the pilot will be able to drive it at a top speed of just under 6.5 mph			0
it ¿ s been an honour serving with you all : engineers @entity52 left , @entity53 , right , and @entity55 , centre , pose in front of @entity12 after @entity55 disembarks			0

robot unveiled in @entity1 today will go on sale for £ 900,000
@entity12 can be controlled by motion *sensor* *technology* in the one - man cockpit or through any phone with a 3g connection
as well as auto targeting your enemy it is easy for those looking for *sweet* *vengeance* - the robot 's heavy artillery fires 6,000 bullet per minute when the pilot smiles
