by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political reporter published : 17:46 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 5 october 2013 it was billed as a historic portrait of @entity5 in the @entity6 surrounded by a loyal ‘ family ’ of virtually all @entity9 mps			1
the photo , taken shortly before this summer ’s recess and unveiled ahead of last week ’s @entity9 , was thought to be the first such picture of the parliamentary party in the @entity14			1
but @entity1 can reveal that several of the mps apparently proudly posing with the prime minister were not actually present when the photograph was taken			1
false unity : the circled mps were added to this photograph after it was taken as they were unable to attend in what has been described as an ‘ entirely inappropriate ’ move , images of the missing @entity23 were added to the picture later			1
embarrassingly , that included @entity28 , who only last week resigned as rail minister to stand as commons deputy speaker			2
he said he was unable to attend the photo call ‘ due to a constituency commitment ’ and was asked by party bosses to have his picture taken separately			1
he is shown , circled , in the left - hand foreground			2
directly behind him is colleague @entity36 , mp for @entity37			2
to the left of mr @entity36 is @entity39 , mp for @entity40			0
both confirmed they had posed later before being slotted into the shot , which shows a smiling mr @entity5 flanked by foreign secretary @entity43 and @entity44			0
behind mr @entity36 and mr @entity39 is the health minister , @entity45 , also circled , who admitted she ‘ could n’t be there on the day ’ as she was in @entity46 promoting the use of life - saving defibrillators			0
photoshopped : from left to right , health minister @entity45 , @entity39 , @entity36 ( behind ) and former rail minister @entity28 ( in front ) were inserted into the left side of the photograph			0
@entity53 , right , was added in at the other side of the picture missing : @entity28 , the former rail minister who is hoping to become deputy speaker of the @entity6 , did n't make the photo busy : health minister @entity45 was in @entity46 promoting defibrillators at the time of the photograph posed later : @entity39 , mp for @entity40 , was subsequently added to the image absentee : @entity36 , mp for @entity37 , also missed out on the shoot at home : @entity53 , mp for @entity64 , was in his constituency at the time meanwhile , superimposed in the right - hand foreground is @entity64 mp @entity53 , circled , who said he was in his constituency as a minister was visiting that day			2
last night , @entity69 condemned the ‘ trickery ’ , while even some @entity9 mps privately said it was wrong			1
@entity73 , @entity74 vice-chairman of the @entity76 ’ administration committee , said : ‘ this was supposed to be a snapshot in history – not some elaborate fake they can keep adding to			0
’ last night , ms @entity45 dismissed suggestions that the picture in any way deceived voters			0
she said : ‘ some of us could n’t be there because we were doing things like trying to save children ’s lives			0

historic portrait was taken while five @entity9 mps were absent
their photos were taken separately and added in later
the five *members* *offered* *excuses* for why they were away
but *critics* *branded* the move ' entirely inappropriate '
