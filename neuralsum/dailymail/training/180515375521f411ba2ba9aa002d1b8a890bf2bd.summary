by @entity0 for most people , most of the time , @entity1 is a bright and breezy place where they share holiday and baby photos and brag about great parties they ’ve been to			2
but the social media site has a darker side , because a new study reveals that status updates can reveal a range of personality traits , including if someone has psychopathic tendencies			1
researchers from @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity20 found that status updates that indicated psychopathy could concern prostitutes , decapitation , pornography and butchers			1
the dark side of @entity1 : status updates can reveal psychopathic traits , say @entity20 researchers ( stock image ) some employers and pyschologists say it is			1
the @entity35 magazine @entity34 went so far as to point out that accused theater shooter @entity36 and @entity40 mass murder @entity38 have common ground in their lack of @entity1 profiles			2
on a more tangible level , @entity44 reports that human resources departments across the country are becoming more wary of young job candidates who do n't use the site			0
the common concern among bosses is that a lack of @entity1 could mean the applicant 's account could be so full of red flags that it had to be deleted			0
psychologist @entity57 told @entity34 magazine that using @entity1 has become a sign of having a healthy social network			0
psychologists have noted that @entity36 , along with several noted mass murderers , have lacked any real friends			0
and this is what the argument boils down to : it 's the suspicion that not being on @entity1 , which has become so normal among young adults , is a sign that you 're abnormal and dysfunctional , or even dangerous , ways			0
people with psychopathic traits are strongly focused on their own wishes , and have a lack of empathy for others			0
these people often break norms and rules , and have a higher inclination to commit crime , the researchers said			0
those with narcissistic personality traits could emphasise their own good characteristics by , for example , noting that others did not understand what true happiness is , the study found			1
people with narcissistic traits are self - absorbed , self - glorifying and have an exaggerated confidence in their own abilities			0
@entity94 personality traits can also be discerned from the analysis of the status updates and are also discerned by how many friends you have on @entity1 and how often you update your status the study also shows that @entity1 users with extrovert and open personalities generally have many friends on @entity1 and update their status more often than others			1

they deceive and manipulate people in their surroundings to gain advantages			0
the research was based on personality tests and content analyses in status updates on @entity1 for just over 300 @entity115 and is the first of its kind			1

they also sent in their 15 most recent status updates			1
the contents of the status updates were then studied with algorithms for latent semantic analysis , which is a method for measuring the significance of words			2
for those people who 've read status updates from friends that seem bizarre , @entity19 psychologist @entity142 , who was involved in the study , has some words of comfort			1
he told @entity150 : ' even if you show psychopathic personality traits on @entity1 , that does n't automatically mean you are a psychopath			2
