by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 05:16 est , 22 october 2013 a work of art is nothing unless it has been recreated in @entity3			2
now , one artist has immortalised perhaps the most difficult , mind - bending masterpieces of them all : @entity9 ’s @entity8			1
the iconic print , with its gravity - defying stairs , bridges and passageways , depicts a world in which normal physical laws do not apply			1
there are seven stairways , and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity wells			0
this means that , for example , inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside - down , but based on their own gravity source , they are climbing normally			0
video : an animation of @entity9 's relativity this complex structure did n’t stop @entity43 @entity17 from painstakingly recreating the impossible - looking world			1
mr @entity17 used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3d model over the course of 15 days for the @entity47 in @entity43			1
the piece will be on display for four months during an exhibition in @entity51 , @entity43 , dedicated to @entity9 , alongside his original works			1
@entity53 artist @entity9 is best known for his mathematical inspired woodcuts , lithographs , and mezzotints			1
he also produced impossible architectural constructions and tessellations that often explore the theme of infinity			0
this is n’t the first time that he has captured the imagination of @entity3 artists			0
two years ago , @entity65 from @entity66 carefully assembled thousands of @entity3 bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible @entity9 pieces			1
mr @entity65 would not reveal how he managed to achieve the seemingly impossible angles and mind - boggling perspectives found in his creations			0
this is n't the first time that he has captured the imagination of @entity3 artists			0
two years ago , @entity65 from @entity66 carefully assembled thousands of @entity3 bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible @entity9 pieces including ' balcony ' ( pictured ) however , he confirmed that he did not used glue or any other adhesive to keep the @entity3 blocks in place			2
‘ the whole problem with ' balcony ' was figuring out exactly what distortion @entity9 had used and reversing it to get an undistorted view of his picture , ’ he said			2
' i then had to build a @entity3 copy of that and then distort a photograph of the result			0
’ @entity9 was born in @entity93 in the @entity53 in 1924			2
by the time he died in 1974 his drawings of impossible structures made him one of the most celebrated graphic artists of the @entity97 .			0
