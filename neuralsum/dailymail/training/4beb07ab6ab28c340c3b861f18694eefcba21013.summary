after years of sticking to its signature , small handsets , @entity0 finally gave in to demand and launched two phablet - style iphones in september			0
but as phones increase in size , the screens become harder to use - especially when trying to navigate or type with one hand			2
to see how phones measure up to the average hand size , designers created a graphic that reveals the ' natural ' and ' unreachable ' thumb zones of four of the most popular handsets from @entity0 and @entity16			1
the graphic ( pictured ) was created by @entity20 - based technology professionals site @entity18			1
it compares the average hand measurements of men and women , as well as the hand size of sports figures such as @entity27			1
the hand size of @entity29 , dubbed @entity29 , was also included this included the @entity31 , and @entity16 's @entity32 and note 4			1

' smartphones have continued to increase in size but our hands have not			0
have you ever wondered how big your hand needs to be to easily reach the entire screen with one hand ? , ' explained the @entity20 - based site			2
in december , a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life , they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain , according to new research			0
experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs			0
they think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone , the bigger the link between brain and hand			2
neuroscientist dr @entity65 , who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use , said our ‘ newfound obsession ’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances			0
‘ we ran some calculations for the @entity31 6 , 6 @entity75 , @entity32 and @entity76 , then compared that to several athletes			1
’ according to the graphic , the average woman is 5ft 4in ( 1.6 metres ) , with an average hand height of 6.7 inches ( 17.1cm ) and width of 2.9 inches ( 7.3cm )			1
while the average man is 5ft 9.5in ( 1.6 metres ) , with an average hand height of 7.4 inches ( 18.8cm ) and width of 3.3 inches ( 8.3cm )			1
@entity0 ’s @entity31 has a 4.7 - inch ( 12cm ) screen			2
the @entity32 's display is 5.1 inches ( 13cm ) , the @entity86 ’ screen measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) and the @entity89 ’s display is 5.7 inches ( 14.5cm )			1
to put this into perspective , retired basketball player @entity90 could use the @entity31 6 and @entity32 comfortably , but @entity93 would struggle with the @entity32			1
even @entity27 , who is 6ft 7in tall ca n't use @entity0 or @entity16 's flagship phones comfortably with one hand			2
the only person who could comfortably use the @entity86 and @entity76 is @entity29 - also known as the @entity29			1
mr @entity29 was 8ft 11.1in ( 2.72 metres ) tall and died in 1940			0
according to the graphic , the average woman is 5ft 4in ( 1.6 metres ) , with an average hand height of 6.7 inches ( 17.1cm ) and width of 2.9 inches ( 7.3cm )			1
@entity0 ’s @entity31 ( left ) has a 4.7 - inch ( 12cm ) screen			2
the graphic reveals the ‘ natural ’ thumb zone ( green ) , the ' reach ' zone in yellow and the ' unreachable ' zone in red the @entity32 's ( pictured left ) display is 5.1 inches ( 13cm )			1
the right - hand image shows the average thumb zones for the average woman and man when using the @entity32 to use the @entity31 6 with one hand , the graphic shows that a user would need to have a hand that measures 9.6 inches ( 24.3cm ) high , and 4.6inches ( 11.7cm ) wide			1
this increases to 11.4 ( 29cm ) inches and 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) for the @entity86 and @entity16 's @entity76			1
using these measurements , the graphic then reveals the ‘ natural ’ thumb zone for all four handsets , for the average hand size of both sexes			1
the @entity86 ’ screen ( left ) is 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) and the @entity76 ’s ( right ) is 5.7 inches ( 14.5cm ) to use the @entity31 6 with one hand , the graphic shows that a user would need to have a hand that measures 9.6 inches ( 24.3cm ) high , and 4.6inches ( 11.7cm ) wide			1
this increases to 11.4 ( 29cm ) inches and 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) for the @entity86 ( left ) and @entity76 ( right ) it also shows the so - called ‘ reach zone ’ in yellow , and in red are the areas that the thumb ca n’t comfortably reach			1
@entity0 is aware of this issue and introduced a @entity137 feature for the @entity31 , which is activated by rubbing a thumb over the @entity140 scanner			2
this brings the app icons nearer to the bottom of the screen to make them easier to reach			2
a @entity147 company has also devised an extension for the thumb that lets people access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand			0
@entity155 - based @entity154 's thumb - shaped style , called the @entity156 - which translates to ‘ finger growth ’ - retails for £ 8.51 ( $ 13.63 )			0
made of silicon , the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs ( 11g ) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger			0
at its tip is a small black conductor , which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact			0
to put this into perspective , retired basketball player @entity90 ( left ) could use the @entity31 6 and @entity32 comfortably , but @entity93 would struggle with the @entity32			1
even @entity27 ( pictured right ) , who is 6ft 7in tall ca n't use @entity0 or @entity16 's flagship phones comfortably with one hand the only person who could comfortably use the @entity86 and @entity76 is @entity29 ( right ) - also known as the @entity29			1

the @entity86 is 7.78cm ( 3.06 inches ) wide , while other large phones include the @entity208 , which is 7.92cm ( 3.12 ) inches wide			2
of course , that ’s just from side - to - side - diagonally the 6 @entity75 is 14cm ( 5.5 inches ) , and the @entity208 is 14.5cm ( 5.7 inches )			0
the average male thumb is 6.96cm ( 2.74 ) inches long and for women it ’s 6.32cm ( 2.49 inches )			2
clearly this poses a problem , as the average thumb can not stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen , which can accidentally register an input			0
using the @entity226 thumb extender , though , 0.6inches ( 1.5 cm ) is added to the length of the thumb			0
this means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they do n’t mind wearing the extender			0

@entity244 was created by technology professionals site @entity18
it compares the average hand measurements of men and women
designers also compared hand sizes of sports stars such as @entity27
these measurements were applied to the @entity31 6 , @entity86 , the @entity32 and the @entity76
graphic reveals ' natural ' zone , ' reach ' zone and ' unreachable ' zone for each
