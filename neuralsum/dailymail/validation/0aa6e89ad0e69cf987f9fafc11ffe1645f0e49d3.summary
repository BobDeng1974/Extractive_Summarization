as more places legalise marijuana , scientists are warning of the potential health risks of eating cannabis - infused snacks			1
with smoking , the peak blood levels happen within 3 - 10 minutes , and with eating , it 's 1 - 3 hours , making it easier to overdose on food - related cannabis products			1
now experts are warning that legalised marijuana needs to have strong restrictions on the drug 's edible products , which are often packaged to appeal to children			1
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' wrote @entity41 and @entity42 of @entity43			1
marijuana use for adults over 21 is fully legal in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity49 passed a similar law that will take effect in july			0
several other states have legalised marijuana for medicinal use or have decriminalised it			2
a notable feature of state - legalised retail sales of marijuana has been the popularity of edibles			1
the problem is that marijuana edibles – which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent – increase the chances that children will overdose , they say			1
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' the @entity43 experts warned professor @entity41 explained that the original marijuana laws ' were not rigorous and detailed in their approach to issues like edibles , @entity46 and @entity47 put extremely modest rules on edibles , therefore making it easy to sell and market edible products , he said			1
' both states require child - resistant packaging , a warning to ' keep out of the reach of children , ' and labelling describing a standard serving size , ' wrote @entity41 and @entity42 ' neither requires warnings that ingested marijuana can have different effects from smoked marijuana			1
' some of the edibles look like @entity93 or @entity94 bars , and the drinks resemble the major brands of non-marijuana colas			1
motor neurons ( pictured ) are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem , and are responsible for giving orders to muscles marijuana users can sometimes have difficulty speaking , breathing and swallowing food as a result of muscle weakness			2
now researchers in @entity111 have conducted a landmark study to shed light on how marijuana reduces the activity of motor neurons that lead to these symptoms			2
motor neurons are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem , and are responsible for giving orders to muscles in the body			0
researchers at the @entity124 , led by professor @entity125 , used synthetic analogues of the psychoactive compounds of marijuana to see how they affected these neurons			2
they looked , in particular , at movements of the tongue and how they responded to the drug			0
' during the investigation , we used an animal model in which we studied the alterations produced by synthetic cannabinoids on the activity of the motor neurons , ' the researchers wrote			0
' in doing so , we discovered that these psychoactive compounds inhibit the information that reaches these neurons via the synapses			0
' in other words , cannabinoids hinder the transmission of information between neurons			0
' all of this could lead to problems speaking , breathing and swallowing food			0
' it evokes tobacco companies ' use of advertising campaigns with youth appeal , ' @entity41 and @entity42 wrote			0
they acknowledge that marijuana is associated with a long history of ' public misinformation ' about the effects of the drug			0
but the scientific record is clear on the documented risk of edibles , especially for children			1
' some of these products contain four or more times the level of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity169 ) that is considered to be a safe dose , ' they noted			0
taken in large doses , @entity169 can produce serious anxiety attacks and psychotic - like symptoms , according to @entity41 and @entity42			0
and strong differences exist in the effects of marijuana when it is eaten rather than smoked			0
case reports document respiratory insufficiency in young children who have ingested marijuana through edibles , @entity41 said			2
a recent study showed that the proportion of ingestion - related emergency department visits by children in @entity46 associated with marijuana ingestion increased after legal restrictions were eased			1
the majority of identified sources in those cases were marijuana edibles .			2

it takes longer feel impact of eating marijuana compared with smoking
@entity43 researchers warn that this can cause *people* to eat too much
marijuana use for over 21s is legal in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
they require child - resistant packaging but experts say this is not enough
some of the edibles look like @entity93 or @entity94 bars , and the drinks resemble the major brands of non-marijuana colas , putting children at risk
