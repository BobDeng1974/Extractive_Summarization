this is the cringe - worthy moment former @entity2 governor @entity1 blundered in on an interview just as his political rival , lieutenant governor @entity4 , was accusing him of being willing to betray voters with false promises			1
@entity1 was elected as @entity8 governor of the sunshine state in 2007 , but became an independent in 2010			1
after his term ended in 2011 he switched sides and is now running for office as a @entity14			1
speaking to the media at the @entity17 of the @entity18 where @entity1 had just kicked - off his re-election campaign , @entity15 - @entity4 was in the middle of a scathing attack on his one - time colleague			2
at this moment , completely unbeknown to @entity4 , @entity1 appears in the background and walks towards the group to say hello			2
@entity4 continues : ' when it 's time to stand up to make a difference , he left			0
' when @entity15 - @entity36 finally notices @entity1 is there he appears momentarily shocked but manages to regain his composure to shake hands with his rival			1
@entity1 declined to respond to a question about @entity43 's comments about his speech 's honesty			2
attack : @entity4 had just accused @entity1 of being willing to say anything to get elected ' he 's just gon na get to debate the lieutenant governor candidate , ' @entity1 said			1
' @entity43 said : ' i feel like i 'm watching a bad political movie			0
@entity1 has become the unpleasant stereotype of a politician willing to say anything and do anything to further ambitions			0
' after an unsuccessful campaign for @entity58 as a @entity8 , and then an independent , @entity1 is now considered the front - runner for the @entity61 gubernatorial nomination			1
in his speech to the @entity63 , @entity1 heaped blistering criticism on current governor @entity50 faces from his likely opponent , portraying him as an opponent to education and the environment and a man out of touch with average @entity71			1
in his speech @entity1 had attacked @entity2 governor @entity73 ( pictured ) over his wealth and business past ' gov. @entity50 has led like this : embrace the ideological fringe , take care of his friends , bully his opponents , hide from the public and the press and run from tough issues , ' @entity1 said			1
' he keeps running because the truth means little to @entity50 because he does n't have a record to run on , because he knows @entity71 do n't support him and that his priorities are wrong			0
' @entity1 gave a glimpse of his sometimes disarming friendliness , rising from his seat to applaud @entity43 when he was introduced , and actually praising him in his speech			0
in his 23 - minute speech , @entity1 reached back to familiar jabs at @entity50 , repeatedly mentioning his wealth and questions about his business past , and going as far to suggest his race against the governor was a battle between good and evil			2
former @entity1 gov. @entity1 , who is running for the post as a @entity14 in 2014 , signs a copy of his book before a speaking event monday			1
' there 's an old quote , " all that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing , '' he said			0
@entity1 attempted to portray himself as an everyday guy who has ' lived paycheck to paycheck ' and still picks up his own dry cleaning , even as he has held high - profile jobs for years and is married to a multi-millionaire			0
he earned more applause , though , when he stepped back from his attacks on @entity50 to offer a litany of plans for the state			0
' he calls for civility , yet his entire speech was attacking ... and insulting gov. @entity50 , ' @entity43 said			0
' it 's a lot of empty rhetoric and i 've known @entity1 for almost 20 years and i 've come to expect that from him			0

@entity1 was elected as @entity8 governor of the sunshine state in 2007
became an independent in 2010 and is now running for office as a @entity14
lieutenant governor @entity134 was giving an interview
he had just accused @entity1 of being willing to say anything to get elected
the pair shook hands and awkward *smiles* were exchanged
