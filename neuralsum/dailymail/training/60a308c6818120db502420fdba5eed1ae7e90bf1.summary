by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 20:44 est , 22 december 2013 @entity3 : 06:02 est , 23 december 2013 people with noble - sounding surnames such as @entity7 and @entity8 are more likely than the average person to work as managers , a new study suggests			1
however , those with names of everyday occupations like @entity13 and @entity14 have a lower than average chance and are more likely to remain lower down the career ladder			1
individuals with prestigious names who have achieved high - ranking jobs include @entity7 , former governor of the @entity21 and @entity22 , the former lord chief justice			2
a survey of 223,000 @entity25 workers by @entity26 has found that people with ' royal sounding ' names were more likely to hold managerial positions the findings come from a study by the @entity33 's @entity26 , which looked at nearly 223,000 @entity25 workers			1
people with surnames such as @entity35 ( emperor ) , @entity37 ( king ) and @entity39 rst ( prince ) were more likely to hold managerial positions than those called @entity48 ( cook ) , @entity40 ( farmer ) , and @entity43 / @entity42 ( baker )			0
' this phenomenon occurs despite the fact that noble - sounding surnames never indicated that the person actually held a noble title , ' the authors wrote			2
it appears that the status associated with a name can ' spill over to its bearer , influencing the status accorded to that person and consequential life outcomes , such as his or her career advancement			0
' the status linked to surnames could shape interpretations of workplace performance or drive people with noble names to ' actively pursue high - status jobs ' , the authors said			0
conversely those with more ' working class ' names such as baker and cook were less likely to be in charge reporting their findings in the journal @entity79 , the authors said that in terms of career outcomes ' characteristics about a person that logic dictates should not make a difference often do			0
' they compared their research to past studies , which have found taller people tend to get higher - status and better paid jobs			0
a ' metaphorical association between height and high social status leads us to believe someone taller would make a better ceo and in a similar way someone with a noble name ' may be seen as more worthy of occupying a managerial position '			0
the study involved using the website @entity102 , the @entity25 equivalent of @entity104 , to collect information on people with the 100 most common @entity25 surnames , plus all people with ' noble sounding ' last names			1
this led to analysis of 222,924 employees and managers with 84 different last names , showing that noble names really do appear to have career benefits .			1

@entity26 looked at names of 223,000 @entity25 workers
found those with ' royal sounding ' names were more likely to be managers
