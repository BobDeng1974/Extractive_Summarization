told to move : @entity0 , 95 , is one of the 1,500 people who have been ' de-registered ' from the medical practice in @entity3 , @entity4 @entity0 has used her gp practice for so long that she remembers when the doctor would visit on a horse and trap			1
now the 95 - year - old great - grandmother is being removed from its register because so many newcomers have moved into the area			1
some 1,500 people are being taken off the database by the medical practice in @entity3 , @entity4 , which has struggled to recruit enough new gps to cope with the market town ’s rapidly growing population – many of them @entity20			1
mrs @entity0 was shocked and upset to be told she would be ‘ de-registered ’ within a fortnight and would have to move to a different clinic			1
when she complained she was told no exception could be made for her because it would be ‘ discriminatory ’			1
mrs @entity0 , a widow from the nearby village of @entity25 , has lived in the area since her birth in january 1919			1
she suffers from a number of health problems , and now fears that her failing eyesight means it would be dangerous for her to start using an unfamiliar surgery in the next nearest town , @entity33			2
she said : ‘ i am deteriorating a bit			2
life is difficult enough without having to change my doctor			2
’ mrs @entity0 lived for 88 years on an arable farm in the village of @entity39 , which was run first by her father @entity40 , then by her husband @entity41 , and finally by her son @entity40			1
she moved out when he sold it four years ago and now lives on her own in a bungalow			0
extra care comes from her family and a cleaner who comes once a week			0
regular check - ups at the surgery are essential for the great - grandmother , who is on medication for diabetes , cholesterol and heart problems			0
after an operation for arthritis and a recent painful fall on her left hip , she also needs a walking frame to get around			0
a letter was sent to mrs dove from the surgery in @entity64 , but telling her that it would be discriminatory towards others forced to move if they had let her stay with them she said : ‘ i ’ve been with the @entity3 surgery all my life , as were my parents before me			1
' in fact when i was tiny the doctor came out in his horse and trap – although of course you had to pay in those days			0
this letter from the surgery just came out of the blue			0
‘ there was no question of discussing it with you or anything			0
when you ca n’t see very well , you could easily fall over			0
i should be very nervous going to @entity33			0
’ local services are under increasing pressure because of @entity3 ’s expanding population			1
new housing developments have attracted so many new residents – many of them eastern @entity91 attracted by farm work in the rural county – that public services are struggling to cope			0
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ this problem has been going on for some time			1
why did n’t they make a fuss before and get help then instead of letting it get to this state ? ’ safety fears : mrs @entity0 's son @entity40 , 71 , is worried his mother will struggle with the change due to her age and health her son @entity107 , 71 , added : ‘ she was very upset by the letter			1
' having been a patient there all her life , she was annoyed			0
she just does n’t want to change			0
' she does n’t know @entity33 – with her failing eyesight she knows where she ’s going in @entity3			1
' you ca n’t keep pulling people into a rural area without putting bits and pieces in place to deal with them			0
’ one of mrs @entity0 ’s friends , who is in her 80s , has also been told she must switch to a new gp nearly ten miles from her home			1
@entity126 manager @entity125 said there was a ‘ national crisis ’ in gp recruitment , with 40 unfilled vacancies across @entity4 alone			1
the clinic already has vacancies for a nurse practitioner and two @entity134 – and another two family doctors are expected to leave by the end of the year			0
‘ this is a matter of patient safety and we have acted out of concern for ongoing patient care and patient safety , ’ she added			0
‘ we were informed by the local area team for @entity145 that we could not be discriminatory and ask some residents to move and ask others to stay – that would have been unlawful			1
' the decision was made on geographical area , where there is an alternative practice to cover a patient ’s primary care			2
’ @entity145 said it understood the pressure on the surgery but felt it was ‘ regrettable ’ that patients were being de-registered			2
@entity158 , of the @entity159 , said every patient should be able to see their gp when they need to – but the situation facing the profession made it increasingly difficult			2
‘ de-registration of patients only takes place as a very last resort , and only when there could be a threat to patient safety , ’ she said			0
‘ this is a consequence of the desperate shortage of gps in many parts of the country , which is leaving the service teetering on the brink of collapse – with the greatest impact being felt on patient care			2

@entity0 , 95 , has been ' de-registered ' from her gp in @entity3 , @entity4
along with 1,500 others , she has been told to move to another practice
the process is a result of lack of gps and increased population
