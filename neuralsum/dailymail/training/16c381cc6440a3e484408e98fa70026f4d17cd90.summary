there was a moment when @entity2 had just joined @entity3 that he decided to take a wander into town			1
an amble around your new surroundings , especially those as glitzy as @entity10 , would be commonplace for most people			2
for @entity2 , it can potentially cause hysteria			1
at @entity3 they were still unsure , at the time of his arrival , just how big @entity2 would be in @entity18			1
@entity2 's move to @entity3 in 2007 paved the way for @entity22 stars crossing the @entity23 the reaction was ginormous as hundreds of reporters and photographers turned up to @entity10 for him @entity2 thought he would gauge the reaction and told a member of club staff he was popping out for a bit			1
‘ do n’t you think you should take that off ? ’ they asked , wide - eyed with surprise and pointing to his @entity3 training top			1
‘ yes , this is what i ’m going to get recognised for … ’ the most famous face on the planet jokingly replied			0
for @entity39 , @entity2 was just the start			1
back when he signed , in july 2007 , @entity2 was surprised by the comparatively low - budget hotels and flights , when he had grown accustomed to exclusive accommodation and private jets			2
but his move paved the way for @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , amongst many other global names , and change is in the air stateside			1
when @entity54 and @entity55 cross the @entity23 this summer , the league is a very different one to when @entity2 blazed the trail eight years ago			1
@entity39 has a long way to go until it is as big as @entity59 in the @entity18 , but @entity54 , set to join @entity61 , and @entity55 , on his way to @entity3 , will carry on @entity2 ’s crusade when they arrive			1
@entity2 made 118 appearances for @entity3 in his five years at the club , scoring 20 goals @entity2 's ( left ) move lead @entity22 stars like @entity48 ( right ) to move to the @entity39 @entity68 manager @entity67 , who was in charge of @entity3 when @entity2 brought the circus to town , explains : ’ everyone ’s got a football team in @entity74			1
over in the @entity18 , everyone ’s got an american football team			2
it ’s huge , the biggest sport			0
that ’s like the @entity22 in @entity74			2
‘ @entity54 and @entity55 coming over is massive			1
it will get people supporting clubs			0
they ’re watching them in the @entity22 on a saturday morning on tv , now they can go watch them live			2
then when they travel to another city the fans there can watch @entity54 and @entity55 play live			1
it ’s only going to help			0
‘ it ’s part of the package they bring			0
these teams can really generate some interest with them			0
they ’re great players , but they ’ve got great names			0
it ’s a big move			0
‘ we just need to get the @entity18 general public really interested , like they are in @entity74			2
@entity3 captain @entity48 ( second left ) presents president @entity102 with a @entity3 jersey another addition to the @entity39 after @entity2 was @entity47 , arguably the @entity22 's greatest player ‘ it ’s getting to that point when it ’s going to take off , like when @entity107 got involved with the @entity22 in the 1990s			1
’ the @entity39 are seeking that big - money tv deal and there are rumours that @entity107 might be bidding to screen @entity39 games live to the @entity112			2
there is a long , long way to go to get anywhere near the £ 5.1billion deal recently reached over here , but names like @entity54 and @entity55 carry obvious allure for the @entity74 market			1
even so , the pair may have to get used to slightly lower than the premium standards they have become accustomed to at their clubs since they were teenagers			0
‘ i think @entity2 was surprised by the level of hotel , the level of travel , ’ @entity67 , who played more than 300 games for @entity127 and has won the @entity128 and coach of the year twice , says			2
@entity47 joined @entity134 in 2010 and played his final game for the club in december 2014 @entity54 followed suit by announcing he was joining @entity61 after being released by @entity138 ‘ it was what we were used to			1
when he came , it opened our eyes up , we realised if we want to move this up a level we needed to start getting serious			0
now everything is top notch			0
‘ it ’s not always first class , but it ’s always good flights			0
some teams charter once in a while			0
’ @entity67 was shocked just how big @entity2 was when he signed			2
for a long time , they would have 300 television cameras , from all parts of the globe , at each press conference			0
during games , the usual few photographers dotted on the side of the pitch were swamped by 250			0
‘ the league was n’t quite ready for what @entity2 brought , ’ @entity67 admits , ‘ which was huge interest from outside of football , too			1
‘ it ’s very good , but for our team it was crazy for a bit			0
@entity2 ’s getting pulled all over for interviews and commercials			2
the team ’s exposed to a bunch of stuff they ’re not used to , @entity178 - type stuff			0
it was fun , but a real crazy , difficult to coach and manage time			0
’ now , it is a different story			0
‘ they ’re ready for @entity54 and @entity55 , ’ he adds			1
@entity54 , currently on loan at @entity183 , will join up with his new teammates in the summer @entity55 announced he will exit @entity185 at the end of the season and will also join @entity3			1

@entity54 and @entity55 head to the mls in the summer
@entity54 moves to @entity61 after his loan spell at @entity183
@entity55 announced he will join @entity3 at the end of the season
@entity2 paved the way for the @entity22 stars
