by @entity0 when @entity1 was in a really bad mood he would go home to his wife @entity5 and bite her head off			1
then it would be the turn of the kids - @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 - to hear their dad grumbling about his career - threatening groin injury in 2010			1
on tuesday , @entity1 spoke of being a better man after private sessions with psychiatrist dr @entity18			1
changed : @entity19 's @entity1 praised the appointment of psychiatrist dr @entity18 to the team staff ‘ i had one - on - one meetings with him , ’ revealed @entity1 ahead of wednesday night ’s clash with @entity23 at @entity24			1
‘ i understand the different parts of the brain , how they work , when they function and why you think certain things , why you bite your children ’s heads off from time to time , blame @entity5 for everything - blah , blah , blah			0
’ there will be scepticism about @entity18 ’ appointment for the @entity38 , but this is a smart move			1
endorsement : @entity1 had one - on - one meetings with @entity18 when going through a groin injury desperate : @entity43 is keen to make an impression on @entity45 neat touch : @entity47 juggles the ball during the training session at @entity50 on monday @entity1 was brave enough to confront his demons at a time when he wondered whether he would ever play for @entity53 or @entity19 again			1
‘ i had a groin avulsion and it ’s a career - threatening injury , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’d seen three or four surgeons and they were n’t really convincing me that i could play again so i turned to him			2
' he helps you with positivity , the power of thought and staying upbeat , that sort of stuff			2
without being a drama queen it was a very important stage in my career			0
‘ i think it was one of the physios at @entity53 who suggested i might need a bit of help from a psychologist so i said , “ who ’s the best ? ” ‘ i was told he was the best			0
’ heads up : @entity75 keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against @entity23 something old , something new : it 's routine for @entity47 but @entity43 is preparing for his @entity19 debut @entity53 's @entity83 praised dr @entity18 in an interview last october as he hit top form for his club			1
' @entity18 had helped a lot in terms of mindset , ' he told the @entity91			1
' he 's all about self - belief : do n't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something , just let it happen			2
' dr @entity18 made @entity83 give himself a mark out of 10 for his @entity53 performances so far			1
' @entity18 told me to say high but i 've never been one to be comfortable			2
i 'm uncomfortable getting comfortable			0
i think , for my capacity as a footballer , i 'd sat a seven out of 10			0
probably even six - i 'm being kind to myself saying a seven			0
i can do a lot better than i 'm doing now			0
' @entity18 , who has worked with sir @entity103 and @entity104 , was nicknamed ‘ head coach ’ when he worked with @entity105 and his book taming the @entity107 was referred to several times by @entity1			1
‘ he just simplifies what ’s going on , ’ added @entity19 ’s captain			1
‘ if you read the book you ’ll understand an awful lot more			0
’ @entity18 is employed by @entity53 and has been seconded by the national team for the @entity38			1
he will join them before they head to @entity118 to begin their tournament preparations at the end of may			0
part of his task will be to help @entity19 ’s players settle into a new environment as they spend weeks away from families , friends and the @entity127			1
support : dr @entity18 with @entity130 gold medalist @entity104 at the @entity131 simplify : @entity1 refers to @entity18 ' book taming the @entity107 when explaining how his techniques worked for him @entity134 beaters : dr @entity18 has helped snooker 's @entity135 and cycling sir @entity137 to victory manager @entity45 is convinced his squad will benefit			1
‘ i do n’t heap too much pressure on him and suggest we will now be better at a @entity38 and suddenly we will never miss a penalty or no player will ever get sent off or lose his temper , ’ said @entity45			0
‘ i have made it clear that every player does n’t have to go to individual meetings with @entity18			2
but we hope having his expertise is going to encourage the players and that he can provide a tool they can benefit from			0
’ still got it : @entity45 gets involved while on the pitch in @entity50 who is dr @entity18 ? a consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate @entity161 has he helped ? @entity18 's clients include @entity130 cyclists such as sir @entity137 and sir @entity103 , @entity135 , @entity53 and @entity19 ’s @entity165 @entity164 ? @entity18 works to a principle called ‘ @entity167 ’ , which says the brain is split into three parts : the rational ‘ human ’ section , the illogical ‘ chimp ’ section and a computer for storing information			1
the way athletes control their ‘ chimp ’ dictates how well they perform			0
put simply , athletes need to control their surges of emotion			0
@entity180 does it work in practice ? @entity18 gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition			2
for each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it			0
@entity18 also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control			2
for example , footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve			0
however , he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there			0
