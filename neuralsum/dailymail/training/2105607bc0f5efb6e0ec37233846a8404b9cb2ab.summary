by @entity0 updated : 01:09 est , 30 may 2012 a mother whose two - year - old son died after drinking plant food intended for a cannabis crop smiled unashamedly after a judge spared her jail yesterday			1
giving @entity8 a suspended sentence , judge @entity7 said she would have to live with the consequences of her ‘ cataclysmic ’ neglect ‘ long after any sentence has been served ’			2
but far from showing remorse , the 24 - year - old smiled as she left court and jokingly asked photographers : ‘ are you going to follow me all the way home ? ’ @entity8 , right , was growing cannabis in her home in @entity22 , @entity23 , and was asleep when her son @entity24 , left , drank the toxic liquid @entity26 , of @entity22 , was convicted of child cruelty in february			1
she had left a bottle of @entity30 plant feed on a windowsill within easy reach of her ‘ inquisitive and adventurous ’ toddler @entity24			0
its childproof lid had not been screwed on properly			0
in november 2010 , @entity26 , who was still in bed with her then boyfriend @entity37 after midday , was woken by a bang and found her son had collapsed and was gasping for breath			1
the trial heard that the toddler , who had not been fed and was probably extremely hungry and thirsty , may have thought the plant feed was a children ’s @entity46 drink			2
tragic toddler @entity26 died after drinking toxic plant food meant to help his mother @entity49 's cannabis grow , thinking it was a @entity46 drink ( right )			1
pictured left is a stock image of a cannabis plant @entity24 was taken to hospital and underwent surgery to remove his stomach and part of his oesophagus , but his windpipe had been burned away by the potassium hydroxide contained in the toxic plant feed			1
he died 11 days later			1
prosecutor @entity63 said that when @entity24 ’s father @entity64 visited the hospital , @entity26 seemed more concerned about moving her cannabis plants than her son ’s condition			1
he recounted : ‘ she told him that she and her partner had been trying to make some money by growing skunk [ a type of cannabis ] in the house , almost seeming annoyed by the involvement of the police because they were going to have to find somewhere else to grow [ the drugs ]			1
’ the home of @entity8 , in @entity22 , where toddler @entity24 drank from a bottle of plant food yesterday the judge said : ‘ i ’m bound to say that @entity24 ’s death was a prolonged and frankly horrible one			1
there is no other way to describe it			0
’ he told @entity26 : ‘ your poor judgment led to fatal consequences			2
the evidence that this liquid was used for growing cannabis was strong			2
you should not even have allowed the liquid to be brought into the same house as @entity24			2
‘ by failing to move the bottle , or supervise him , you allowed this terrible event to happen			0
’ a jury had heard that police found material relating to cannabis - growing on a computer in the cluttered house , but @entity24 ’s bedroom was ‘ curiously empty ’			1
the prosecution said mr @entity37 had time to remove any plants after the child went to hospital			2
@entity26 , who now has a daughter aged almost one whom she is allowed to visit in foster care , denies that cannabis was grown in the house			1
she was given a 12 - month jail sentence , suspended for two years			0
the judge said a pre-sentence report stated that @entity26 had been a loving mother to @entity24 and no purpose would be served by her going to jail			1
but mr @entity64 , 33 , said outside @entity121 yesterday : ‘ it ’s sickening			0
where ’s the justice for @entity24 ? i wanted justice for him			0
i expected @entity49 to be sent to jail			0
but now she can just carry on with her life as if @entity24 never existed			0
‘ i do n’t believe she has ever shown remorse			0
she ’s got her life but @entity24 has n’t got his			0
she should pay the consequences			0
