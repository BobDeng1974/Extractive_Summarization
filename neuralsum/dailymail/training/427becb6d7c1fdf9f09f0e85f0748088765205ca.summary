in artistic terms they were at polar opposites of the photographic spectrum			0
the wanton destruction and grim resilience of war is not a subject you would associate with high fashion glamour shots of the rich and beautiful			1
but when flamboyant photographer @entity12 was enlisted during the @entity13 , his striking collection showed the six - year conflict in a new , more graceful , picturesque light			1
relaxed : a soldier orders a cup of tea in the @entity19 at @entity20 in 1942			0
the soldier pictured was the butler of a close friend of photographer @entity12 as well as glamorous portraits of @entity27 soldiers , @entity12 's portfolio also catalogues famous landmarks , such as a war - ravaged @entity29 in @entity31 war effort : a female welder works on the deck of a new ship in @entity36 in 1943 , in another expertly - composed @entity12 photograph from the 7,000 - strong collection dressed to impress : smartly - dressed flight lieutenant @entity39 poses for a portrait			1
right , a wren serving with the crew of a harbour launch in @entity44 , 1941 the photographer , whose most notable subjects included @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , was commissioned for an altogether grittier photographic project that could be used as propaganda			1
moving him away from his usual fare of royalty and fashion models , the @entity52 asked @entity12 to document @entity27 's war effort			1
the renowned photographer pictured young men and women in a typically glamorous light , in spite of the ravages , destruction and chaos engulfing @entity27 in 1940			1
battered : a wider image from @entity12 's collection shows bomb damage to the @entity68 and @entity69 in @entity31 in 1940 make do and mend : a sailor on board @entity71 uses a portable sewing machine to repair a signal flag on a voyage to @entity75 , while a @entity27 sailor on shore leave in @entity78 looks natural in front of the camera in 1941 photogenic : although also cataloguing damage to buildings , @entity12 also captured images like this one of @entity86 officers at the @entity87 in @entity88 in 1941 villagers cross duckboards over floating bamboo poles in @entity92 , @entity93 in 1944			1
the poles were soaked in fresh water to prepare them for construction use war heroes : squadron leader @entity99 of @entity100 sits on the wing of his @entity102 at @entity103 in 1941 for a relaxed portrait picture blitz spirit : a workman uses a wheelbarrow to clear debris from the floor of @entity110 after its first bombing			1
it was completed destroyed in 1942			0
his eye - catching portfolio stays away from corpses , blood and the unimaginable horror of the front line , featuring instead photogenic soldiers presenting a united front for the @entity121			0
even so , @entity12 does tug on the heartstrings in his collection : one of the most memorable images shows wounded three - year - old @entity127 at @entity128 , in an evocative picture which would later grace the cover of @entity131 in september 1940			1
the picture was clearly effective - as it was taken with the aim of generating sympathy for the @entity27 and helping sway @entity135 into intervening in the war			2
iconic : renowned photographer @entity12 , who died in january 1980 throughout a distinguished career , @entity12 achieved worldwide fame as a photographer , designer , writer , cartoonist , diarist and socialite			1
the @entity148 - born photographer is widely remembered as the leading @entity27 portrait and fashion photographer of his day			2
during his career he photographed @entity152 and the @entity153 , who he described as his favourite royal sitter			0
he was also employed as staff photographer for @entity156 and @entity157 , and went on photograph @entity49 , @entity48 and @entity47			2
as a commissioned war photographer , it was @entity12 's image of a young girl in @entity128 which arguably persuaded @entity135 to join the global conflict			1
before the image was published on the cover of @entity131 in 1940 , @entity135 was yet to participate in the @entity13			0
but the evocative image saw the @entity135 public put further pressure on their government to assist @entity27			0
after the @entity13 he turned to @entity171 , working as a set , lighting and costume designer			0
his creative flair saw @entity176 for costume design on films @entity179 ( 1958 ) and @entity180 ( 1964 )			0
he also designed the period costumes for the 1970 film on a @entity183			0
by the end of the 1970s his health had deteriorated , and he died at his @entity188 home in january 1980 , aged 76			0
elsewhere he features soldiers relaxing after a @entity191 desert patrol and a sailor repairing a signal flag on the way to @entity75			0
@entity12 took a staggering 7,000 pictures in all during the project , which were passed through the ministry 's @entity197 before being published in books and magazines			1
but after being catalogued without using his name , the raft of images became lost in archives until they were recently re-discovered			2
a collection of more than 100 pictures are now on display at @entity31 's @entity209 , in an exhibition titled ' @entity12 : @entity211 '			1
@entity212 , head curator of the museum 's photographic archive , found over 100 unknown pictures while examining files			2
@entity217 traveled : @entity86 stewards at the @entity87 , @entity88 form this picture in @entity12 's portfolio , along with a war image from @entity222 , @entity223 , in 1942 ( right ) global effort : three men of the @entity226 enjoy a moment 's relaxation with cigarettes after returning to headquarters in , @entity231 , @entity191 , in 1942 she recognised them as being similar in style to the work of @entity12 , and confirmed they were his work by matching them to his diary records			1
she said : ' the @entity52 was in disarray in those days and the records were n't kept well			0
' it was not practice to record the name of the photographer			2
but we always knew these images existed somewhere			0
' after ceasing wartime operations , the @entity52 deposited @entity12 's war photos with the @entity209 , @entity31			1
the photographer was briefly reunited with his vast body of work shortly before his death			2
suave : @entity253 pilot @entity252 , who later broke the @entity255 record , pictured with his spitfire at @entity103 in 1941 all hands to the pump : a fireman dampens down flames in a bombed building during the @entity261 in @entity31 in 1940			0
four years later , @entity12 photographed the @entity93 police force grouped in a circular doorway at headquarters in @entity265 digging in : a woman made homeless by the @entity261 receives a hit meal at a welfare centre in @entity269 , @entity31 , in 1940 describing the experience , he wrote in his diary : ' yesterday i went to the @entity209 , not my favourite place , to see the collection of photographs that i had taken during the war for the @entity52			1
' it was an extraordinary experience to relive those war years ; so much of it had been forgotten , and most of the people are now dead			2
' it was fascinating to see the scenes in old @entity285 , the rickshaws drawn by uniformed servants , the grandeur of the houses , the palaces , the bar scenes , the men on leave swigging beer , i had not realised that i had taken so many documentary pictures , some of purely technical interest			0
' looking at them today , i spotted ideas that are now ‘ accepted ’ , but which , thirty years ago , were before their time			0
the sheer amount of work i had done confounded me			0
' more information about the @entity12 exhibition can be found at the @entity209 's website .			1
