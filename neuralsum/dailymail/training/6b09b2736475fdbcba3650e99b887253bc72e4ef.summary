by @entity1 reporter published : 16:38 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 8 january 2013 the holidays may be over , but a @entity4 woman wants to keep a light display on her roof extending a middle finger to her neighbors			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 heard testimony monday about whether @entity12 should be granted a preliminary injunction , barring the city of @entity15 and police from requiring her to remove the display			1
the judge did n't rule and the hearing will continue next week			0
@entity20 said she put up the roof message in november because she believed a neighbor stole her dog			0
she said police threatened her with fines and arrest because of the lights			2
she and the @entity28 of @entity4 sued the city , its mayor and police			1
@entity31 may be over , but @entity32 wants to continue with her ' rude ' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor @entity35 now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog lawyers for @entity15 and police say officials did n't threaten @entity20 and the case has no merit			1
but they also argue the display is n't protected speech under the @entity47 because the extended finger is designed to attack her neighbor			2
the judge issued a temporary restraining order in mid-december , prohibiting city officials from interfering with the lights and saying efforts to take down the display would violate her rights to free speech and due process			1
with the @entity31 holidays wrapped up and many people packing up their holiday lights , the federal judge asked monday if the lawsuit still was needed			1
' is this matter now moot ? are the lights still up ? ' he asked			0
' the lights are still up , ' said @entity69 , an @entity28 lawyer representing @entity20			1
' and she intends to keep them up ? ' @entity9 asked			0
' i think she intends to keep them up , your honor , ' @entity69 replied			0
@entity35 has twice removed the lights from her roof , but with the support of the @entity28 of @entity4 she is attempting to sue the city , its mayor and police according to the lawsuit , @entity20 removed the lights twice : once after a police officer told her she could be fined and again after another officer threatened to arrest her			1
but she has reinstalled them , after getting representation from the @entity28 and the judge 's temporary order in her favor			2
in monday 's testimony , @entity15 police officer @entity95 described two visits to @entity20 ' home in response to complaints from @entity20 that her neighbors were harassing her			2
under initial questioning from @entity20 ' lawyer , @entity95 said he did n't recall if he told her to take down the light display or told her she could go to jail because of it			2
he said he found the lights offensive and thought it could be considered disturbing the peace			0
' i remember telling her if she did n't take it down , it could lead to trouble , ' the police officer said			0
then , @entity20 ' lawyers played a partial recording that @entity20 had made with her cell phone during one conversation with @entity95 in which he told her she could end up in jail because of the lights			0
@entity95 said he was n't threatening her , but was just advising her that she could run into a complaint by her neighbors accusing of her disturbing the peace .			0

mother of four @entity12 designed her @entity31 lights to send a ' rude ' message to neighbors she has been *warring* with for a year
police initially told her to remove the display or face a possible *$* *400* fine
she removed the lights , but the @entity28 got involved and supported her first *amendment* rights to display the **provocative** image
now decorations are coming down , but she wants to continue with her **provocative** display
