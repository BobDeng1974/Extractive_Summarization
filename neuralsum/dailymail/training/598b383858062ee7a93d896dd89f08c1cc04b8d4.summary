@entity12 told police she had seen their parents suffocating 17 - year - old @entity1 with a plastic bag			1
she claims her sister ’s desire to live a westernised lifestyle had brought ‘ shame ’ on family in the eyes of their @entity22 - born parents , @entity23 , 52 , and his 49 - year - old wife @entity24			1
but she did not accuse her parents of the killing until she was arrested for organising an armed robbery at the family home seven years after the alleged murder			1
yesterday @entity12 denied making up her version of events out of desperation after police saw through her lie that she had n’t set up the robbery			1
and while she admitted she had initially accused her family of framing her over the break - in , she insisted she was now telling the truth			2
cross-examining @entity12 , her father ’s barrister , @entity42 , said : ‘ you knew you could buy yourself out of trouble by making up a wicked story about your parents			1
’ she answered : ‘ i do n’t think the police are stupid enough to go on a story if they have n’t got any evidence			0
’ mr @entity50 suggested her account was based on reading about the inquest into @entity1 ’s death ‘ and you used that knowledge to save your skin ’			0
she denied this , adding : ‘ it has n’t saved my skin at all			0
’ mr @entity50 also challenged her claim that she spoke out after being ‘ haunted ’ for years by the memory of @entity1 ’s murder			2
he suggested she made her claims because ‘ you ’d just been caught red - handed committing a robbery at your parents ’ house ’			1
@entity12 answered : ‘ that ’s not true			2
’ a group of men burst into the family home in @entity73 , @entity74 in august 2010 while mr @entity23 was out , tying up @entity12 ’s mother , brother and surviving sisters			1
accused of murder : @entity1 's mother @entity1 , left , and @entity23 , right , deny murder but @entity12 was n’t tied up			1
after the robbers escaped with cash and jewellery her family , who had heard them say her name , told police she had organised the raid			2
she was arrested and a mobile phone @entity86 containing text messages she had exchanged with the robbers was recovered from a toilet down which she had attempted to flush it			0
@entity12 , now 23 , has pleaded guilty to involvement in the robbery but has not yet been sentenced			1
jurors at @entity94 have been told by the prosecution that she received no ‘ inducements ’ over her punishment in exchange for testifying against her parents			0
speaking from behind a curtain shielding her from her parents in the dock , @entity12 insisted she did n’t know the gang ’s identities or how they got in			1
but she admitted that after police discovered the @entity86 , she claimed her phone had been taken off her by her mother and younger sister mevish the previous evening			0
mr @entity50 said she had been trying to suggest any ‘ incriminating text messages ’ had been put there in order to frame her			0
family home : the @entity113 lived in this house in @entity73 , @entity74 @entity12 admitted she had been trying to get herself out of trouble			1

he put it to her : ‘ that ’s you , @entity12 – you tell lies to get yourself out of trouble and you tell lies about your family			1
’ she answered : ‘ on that occasion , yes			0
’ but she insisted she had been ‘ open and honest ’ in her evidence to the court			0
mr @entity50 said tapes show that officers interviewing @entity12 after the robbery told her ‘ we can only help you if you help us ’			1
they also told her ‘ we are aware of how girls in @entity6 families can be trapped , we know the price of not doing what you ’re told ’			0
he suggested she then asked for the recording to be stopped so she could play her ‘ trump card ’			0
‘ you decided to tell the police it was your parents who killed your sister and you did it to get yourself out of trouble , ’ the barrister added			2
on trial : @entity23 , left , and @entity1 , right , are said to have killed their 17 - year - old daughter because she refused to obey them denying his account , she sobbed as she answered that she had been ‘ feeling really torn ’ at the time			2
‘ i ’ve got my sister who died on one side and my parents who i care about on the other , ’ she added			2
