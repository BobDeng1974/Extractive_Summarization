possible presidential candidate @entity2 's health issues have been kept secret for fears they will ruin her eligibility to become president , it has been claimed			1
the remarkable claim comes in a new book written by journalist @entity9 which details the rocky relationship between the @entity12 and the @entity14 families			1
the excerpt on her health includes a claim from a cardiac specialist familiar with @entity14 's condition as saying her clotting in the brain could have developed into a stroke			2
@entity2 pictured yesterday signing copies of her new book ' @entity27 '			2
her book has been released right as another book by @entity9 claims her serious health issues have been kept secret in further excerpts of the book reported by @entity34 , the author claims @entity2 's health problems , which have included the blood clot between her skull and brain , were revealed in a trip to hospital after she fainted			1
he wrote she had a track record of fainting and a tendency to form blood clots			1
' she also suffered from a thyroid condition , which was common among women of her age , and her fainting spells indicated there was an underlying heart problem as well			0
' a cardiac stress test indicated that her heart rhythm and heart valves were not normal			0
the author added : ' she had managed to keep her medical history secret out of fear that , should it become public , it would disqualify her from becoming president			0
' it is claimed @entity14 , pictured left doing publicity for her own new book , has a tendency to develop blood clots it made headlines worldwide when @entity14 fainted and was concussed in an accident it was claimed occurred at her home in 2012			1
her health has also become a talking point in recent weeks as speculation continues over whether she will run for the 2016 presidency			2
in defending his wife last month , former president @entity14 said it took his wife ' six months of very serious work ' to get over her concussion induced health issues but she is fine now			1
however , @entity14 's statement inadvertently raised more questions about her health than it did to put a lid on the story			2
@entity91 strategist @entity90 recently called for @entity14 to publicly release her medical records , although he shied away from questioning her health			2
meanwhile , @entity9 's book ' @entity96 ' has meticulously detailed the animosity between the @entity98 and the @entity99 - the two power couples of the @entity101			1
dating back to then senator @entity12 's defeat of @entity2 for the 2008 @entity104 nomination they believed was theirs , @entity14 has never forgiven @entity12 for allegations he made during that bitter campaign			1
' i hate that man @entity12 more than any man i 've ever met , more than any man who ever lived , ' said @entity14 to a friend after @entity12 suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to @entity9 's book , excerpts of which appear in the @entity117			1
they nicknamed @entity2 the ' @entity130 ' , in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the @entity133			2
in the run up to the 2012 election , president @entity12 's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure - touch of @entity14 if he wanted to secure a second term			1
loathe to do this , president @entity12 finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in september 2011 , to ask for his help			2
controversial : @entity9 's new book lays bare the anger and hatred at the heart of the relationship between the @entity99 and the @entity98 ' i ’m not going to enjoy this , ' @entity14 told @entity2 according to @entity9			1
' i ’ve had two successors since i left the @entity153 — @entity154 and @entity12 — and i ’ve heard more from @entity154 , asking for my advice , than i ’ve heard from @entity12			2
i have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever , ' @entity14 said			0
' sometimes we just stare at each other			0
it ’s pretty damn awkward			0
now we both have favors to ask each other , and it ’s going to be very unpleasant			0
but i ’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side			0
' the golf game was petty , tetchy and not without incident			0
president @entity14 immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding @entity12 that he presided over an economic golden age , while @entity12 was struggling to affect any change during the @entity172			1
hammering home his point , @entity14 told president @entity12 that obviously he and @entity2 would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be ' the most qualified , most experienced candidate , perhaps in history			1
' this rankled with president @entity12 , acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the @entity153			0
' and so @entity14 continued to talk about @entity2 ’s qualifications			1
and the coming campaign in 2016 , ' writes @entity9 as featured in the @entity117			0
deal : according to @entity9 , @entity14 agreed to fully campaign for @entity12 on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016 ' but @entity12 did n’t bite			1
he changed the subject several times			0
then suddenly , @entity12 said something that took @entity187 by complete surprise			0
he said , ‘ you know , @entity122 would make a great presidential candidate , too			0
’ ' @entity14 was speechless			0
was @entity12 comparing @entity122 ’s qualifications to @entity2 ’s ? ' @entity14 said that if he had n’t been on a mission to strike a deal with @entity12 , he might have stormed off the golf course then and there			1
' a deal was struck nonetheless and @entity14 delivered a barnstorming speech to the @entity198 , which threatened to upstage the president himself .			0
