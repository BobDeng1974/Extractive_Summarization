for those people i can only say i hope you never have to go through what we do as a family			1
' on top of all that , today as we are trying to summon up the courage and composure to face the 1 year anniversary , we learned about a video game that was made called " the slaying of @entity2 ' , the title alone , was painful			2
through conversation with the maker of the game on twitter , we have learned he intended it to be a video game addressing the gun control debate			2
but why ? we do not understand why anyone would do this ? perhaps someone else knows the answer			0
' we do not encourage this game , nor do we condone it			2
we only bring attention to it so that we can perhaps reach the maker and make him understand why his message was delivered in the most inappropriate way			0
we can not understand why anyone would think what happened at @entity2 is something that can or should be made into a " game "			2
this is real life to us			0
