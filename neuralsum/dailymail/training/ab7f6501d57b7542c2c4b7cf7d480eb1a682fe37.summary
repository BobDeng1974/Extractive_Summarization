the @entity1 government has been ridiculed for producing a poster that is supposed to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign			2
they claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by @entity11 fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports , rejecting members of their family and changing eating habits			1
the poster was launched as part of a new £ 320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the @entity24 attacks in early january , when 17 innocent people were killed over three days			1
but the attempt to inform the public backfired , with many ridiculing it for some of the suggestions made in the @entity33 poster			0
' and another added : ' @entity1 parents : if your kids stop eating baguette they 're basically halfway to jihad			0
' the ad is titled : ' jihadist radicalisation - the first warning signs			0
' the poster has a total of nine pictograms , with the crossed - out baguette featuring the caption : ' they 're changing their eating habits '			1
a figure of a swimmer with a cross is superimposed with the phrase : ' they 're stopping sports			1
' the ad provides a hotline to call to identify people suspected of radicalisation to the authorities			0
other advice offered is more obvious , with people being told to be aware if their friends or family are visiting extremist websites or social media accounts , becoming removed from old friends as they now consider them ' impure ' and stopping listening to popular music			1
a change in wardrobe towards more traditional @entity81 garments , quitting school or work and stopping watching television are other warning signs that are flagged up			2
part of the campaign reads : ' to recruit teens and young adults , boys and girls , terrorist groups are also using real technical mental manipulation			2
it is this strategy that can resemble recruitment to a form of sectarian indoctrination			0
' these manipulation techniques aim to get these young people to gradually reject their environment to isolate them , put them under the authority of the radical discourse and convince them			0
' evil : @entity106 ( left ) and @entity107 ( right ) , who killed 12 people in an attack on the @entity24 magazine offices in central @entity111			1
the pair then died following a siege defiant : an aerial view taken on january 11 shows people attending the unity rally @entity116 at the @entity118 in @entity111 in tribute to the 17 victims of a three - day killing spree by homegrown islamists @entity123 : the satirical magazine was targeted because of it frequently published cartoons about @entity81 on january 7 , @entity1 was gripped by terror when radicalised brothers said and @entity129 stormed the @entity24 offices in central @entity111 and killed 12 people			1
the next day , their associate @entity131 shot and killed a policewoman , before then taking hostages in a kosher supermarket the day after			0
there , he killed a further four people before being gunned down when police stormed the building			2
since then , the country has remained on high alert with armed soldiers guarding places of worship and schools across the country .			0
