by @entity1 reporter published : 23:07 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 18 june 2013 president @entity2 last night insisted that the @entity4 's top secret monitoring of @entity7 ' phone and internet data ' is transparent ' as he sought to defuse fears following the revelations of leaker @entity10			1
nonetheless , in the sit down with @entity13 on @entity14 , the president said he will meet soon with a privacy and civil liberties oversight board to discuss ways to balance the need for @entity7 surveillance while respecting people 's right to privacy			1
‘ it is transparent , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ that 's why we set up the @entity25 court , ’ he added , referring to the secret court set up by the @entity25 that authorizes two recently disclosed programs : one that gathers @entity7 phone records and another that is designed to track the use of @entity7 - based @entity31 servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism			1
the orders that result from hearings in which only government lawyers are present are classified			0
@entity2 told the @entity14 anchor that he has asked the intelligence community to see if there is more that can be revealed about it to reassure people			2
‘ what i 've asked the intelligence community to do is see how much of this we can declassify without further compromising the program			0
... and they are in that process of doing so now , ’ he said			0
@entity2 has come under fire for the scope of surveillance by the @entity4 revealed by former government contractor @entity10			1
within the law ? the president emphasized that the information leaked by @entity10 revealed nothing illegal ‘ the way i view it , my job is both to protect the @entity7 people and to protect the @entity7 way of life , which includes our privacy , ’ he said			1
the president said the government must find a way to clarify in peoples ’ minds that intelligence activity is in their interest more than it is not			0
‘ we 're going to have to find ways where the public has an assurance that there are checks and balances in place ... that their phone calls are n't being listened into ; their text messages are n't being monitored , their emails are not being read by some big brother somewhere , ’ @entity2 said			1
the president stressed that nothing has changed about the government 's ability to listen in on @entity7 ' communications since , ' the same way it 's always been			2
' ' what i can say unequivocally is that if you are a @entity7 person , the @entity4 can not listen to your telephone calls , and the @entity4 can not target your emails … and have not , ' he said			1
' they can not and have not , by law and by rule , and unless they ... go to a court , and obtain a warrant , and seek probable cause , ' he went on			0
@entity2 also told @entity114 he wanted to encourage a national debate on the balance between privacy and national security			2
do n't fear the government : now at the @entity121 conference , @entity2 taped an interview with @entity13 before he left wherein he assured everyday @entity7 their phones are n't tapped and their emails are n't being read timing ? @entity2 's interview came soon after outrage over @entity4 reports leaked by @entity10 painted the administration as far from transparent and what i want to do is to set up and structure a national conversation , not only about these two programs , but also the general problem of data , big data sets , because this is not going to be restricted to government entities , ’ he said			1
despite the heavy topics of the night , the president was able to inject at least a little bit of humor : ' some people say , " well , you know , @entity2 was this raving liberal before			2
now he ’s , you know , @entity145			0
" @entity145 sometimes says , ‘ yeah , you know ? he took all lock , stock and barrel			0
” my concern has always been not that we should n’t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism , but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances			2
' @entity2 is in @entity158 for a meeting of leaders of allied countries			0
as @entity2 arrived , the latest series of @entity164 articles drawing on the leaks claims that @entity167 eavesdropping agency @entity166 repeatedly hacked into foreign diplomats ' phones and emails with @entity7 help , in an effort to get an edge in such high - stakes negotiations			1
@entity2 's announcement follows an online chat monday by @entity10 , the man who leaked documents revealing the scope of the two programs to @entity164 and the @entity181 newspapers			1
he accused members of @entity183 and administration officials of exaggerating their claims about the success of the data gathering programs , including pointing to the arrest of would - be @entity190 subway bomber @entity189 in 2009			0
lame duck ? @entity2 may also have an even more personal reason to want @entity7 to cool down over the @entity4 leaks			1
recent poll numbers show his popularity has plummeted since the @entity10 leaks to 45 percent apporval @entity13 's 45 - minute interview with @entity2 also covered such topics as the @entity200 election , the civil war in @entity202 , @entity203 , drone policy , among other issues			1
@entity2 's approval rating among @entity7 has dropped eight percentage points over the past month , down to 45 percent , according to a @entity210 / @entity209 poll			1
the fallout over the surveillance programs was cited as a reason			0
' i think the @entity7 public can accept the fact if you tell them that every time you pick up the phone it 's going to be recorded and goes to the government , ' said the police commissioner at a recent event			2
' i think the public can understand that			0
i see no reason why that program was placed in the secret category			0
' @entity229 also disagrees with attorney general @entity231 's stance that @entity10 's leak seriously damages national security and the fight against terrorism			0
his comments also seem to distrust , at least mildly , president @entity2 's assertions in monday night 's @entity13 interview where the president continually maintained that , if you 're @entity244 , the @entity4 is not listening to your phone calls as part of the program uncovered by @entity10			1
' i think if you listen to @entity10 , ' said @entity229 , ' he indicates that there ’s some sort of malfeasance , people			2
sitting around and watching the data			0
so i think the question is : what sort of oversight is there inside the @entity4 to prevent that abuse , if it ’s taking place ? ' according to @entity2 , any wiretapping or surveillance must go through several layers of bureaucracy in order to be implemented			1
@entity2 has also said , and reiterated in monday 's interview , that there is a balance struck between ensuring privacy and keeping @entity7 safe			1
@entity229 , however , disagrees			0
' i think we can raise people ’s comfort level if in fact information comes out as to that we have these controls and these protections inside the @entity4 , ' he said			2
@entity229 believes the public does n't know enough about the supposed checks and balances to be comforted by them			0
@entity229 went on to use @entity10 's claims as evidence that the checks and balances do n't even exist			1
' he tried to give the impression , it seems to me , that these system administrators had carte blanche to do what they wanted to do , ' @entity229 said			0
' i think it ’s a problem if that ’s in fact what ’s happening			0

' if you ’re a @entity7 person , then @entity4 is not listening to your phone calls and it ’s not targeting your emails ' : the president emphasized that everyday americans are not monitored by the @entity4
@entity2 maintained the activities revealed by @entity10 are legal and subject to bureaucratic checks and balances
