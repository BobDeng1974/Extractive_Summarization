by @entity1 reporter published : 19:50 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 20:04 est , 11 august 2013 @entity3 is set to be late this year , but when it arrives it should bring a bumper crop of fruits and berries in the countryside , wildlife experts have said			1
the autumn fruiting is expected to be delayed as a result of the late spring , but the recent warm weather means wild berry crops will flourish , according to early data collected by the public for the @entity17 ’s nature ’s calendar project			1
the promise of a bumper autumn is good news for wildlife , which suffered in the face of exceptionally poor crops of wild fruit last year when trees and shrubs were affected by the washout summer , and then were hit by this spring ’s cold snap			2
great expectations : @entity17 research shows that records for 16 species of trees and shrubs show that 14 of them , including beech ( pictured ) had their worst season for fruiting in the past decade , last year records for 16 species of trees and shrubs collected since 2001 show that 14 including beech , holly and brambles or blackberries last year saw their worst season for fruiting since the turn of the century , with many recording only meagre crops			0
dr @entity46 , the nature ’s calendar project manager , said : ' although our records suggest that autumn fruiting will be late this year due to the delayed onset of spring flowering , if the warm weather interspersed with occasional wet spells continues , this should mean the fruiting of shrubs like bramble , rowan and blackthorn is abundant			2
' wildlife species will no doubt benefit from a bumper crop , and finally fruit - eating birds and mammals will be able to enjoy an autumn feast			0
@entity66 : a bumper crop of blackberries and holly berries are expected this @entity3 last year , birds and mammals suffered some of the poorest fruiting crop in years and this , coupled with the prolonged cold snap in spring , meant that many species had to endure a long period without a decent food supply			1
' she urged members of the public to take part in the nature ’s calendar scheme to record the changing of the seasons , which helps experts understand how wildlife is adapting to the changing environment			0
the number of citizen recorders has been falling year on year , and the @entity17 wants more people to sign up to contribute to the project which has records dating back to the 17th century .			0
