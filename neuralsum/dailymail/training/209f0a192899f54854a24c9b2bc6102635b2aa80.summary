the challenge was to boldly send a burger and chips where no fast food had gone before			0
and that 's what two fast - food entrepreneurs managed to achieve			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , the proprietors of @entity10 - based burger outlet @entity8 , decided to attempt the outlandish challenge for a third time two weeks ago			1
take - off : @entity14 loads the burger and chips onto their flying device first mission : the business partners claimed they were sending the first burger and chips into space the business partners had made previous attempts to complete the stunt in june and august but their recording equipment broke and both trips were unsuccessful			1
the pair sent the burger and chips meal 112,000ft up and incredibly the video has now been viewed almost 89,000 times			2
writing about their reason for sending a burger and chips into space the owners of @entity8 wrote in the video description : ' we sent a burger and chips to space			2
' science : the two men have a background in physics and they spent Â£ 2,000 on the project the @entity46 ! @entity14 described the burger as being cold after it landed following the stunt mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 needed a burger , chips , a balloon the size of a two - bedroom house , lots of helium , a gps transponder , hand - warmers , a camera , a parachute , duck - tape and some string in order to send the fast food skywards			1
speaking on the video mr @entity11 said the mission was reborn and they were eager to finally achieve their goal			0
the footage was captured on a @entity71 camera and a loud bang is heard after two minutes and 50 seconds when the balloon expanded to eight metres in height			0
a message then appears on - screen which states that the burger was found 32 miles from the launch site			0
one internet user on @entity79 humorously labelled the burger and chips as @entity82 .			0
