by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 12:28 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 07:56 est , 7 august 2012 @entity4 stormed to yet another cycling gold yesterday – as the forlorn @entity7 said @entity9 ’s riders are hiding their ‘ magic wheels ’ after the races			1
@entity12 , 24 , powered to victory over @entity7 @entity14 in the men ’s sprint in front of 6,000 baying fans			1
it was @entity4 ’s fifth track cycling gold out of seven events			1
there are hopes of three more today with sir @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 all expected to win medals			1
‘ we are asking a lot of questions : how have they gained so many tenths of seconds ? ’ she said			0
‘ have they found a new training process based on certain energy pathways ? i am not talking about any illicit product , because anti-doping tests are so strong			0
‘ we are looking a lot at the kit they use			0
they hide their wheels a lot			2
the ones for the bikes they race on are put in wheel covers at the finish			0
’ the dejected director of the @entity7 cycling team , @entity37 , left , has accused @entity4 's cyclists of using ' magic wheels ' , a claim denied by @entity9 's performance director @entity68 , right last night @entity4 ’s bemused cycling performance director @entity68 said : ‘ it ’s interesting that people are starting to ask questions			1
' it ’s no different from when we raced the last three - and - a - half weeks at the @entity74			0
' it ’s the same method , the same philosophy and essentially fantastic coaching which is the only secret weapon we possess			0
‘ as far as the @entity36 go , only two weeks are important – one week in @entity79 , one week here			0
and we ’ve peaked for both			0
’ last week @entity7 president @entity82 taunted @entity4 for its lack of early gold medal success			1
but @entity9 is now well clear of @entity7 in the medals table			1
@entity86 - born @entity12 was picked ahead of @entity36 legend sir @entity24 , but emphatically beat seven - time world champion @entity14 , the favourite for the title , to take the gold			1
it was @entity12 ’s second of the @entity36 and adds to the one he won in @entity79			1
he is already being tipped for more medals at @entity93 in 2016			2
‘ it ’s amazing , ’ he admitted , ‘ i had n’t even thought about it until we got on to that last ride and it suddenly dawned on me			0
‘ the battle i had just to get here with @entity24 [ @entity24 ] – i thought i ’d better not mess this one up			2
now i am really pleased to deliver for the team			2
’ victory : @entity4 's @entity12 ( left ) celebrates defeating @entity7 's @entity14 to win gold in the @entity105 @entity4 's @entity12 celebrates with the cheering crowd in the velodrome stamp of approval : the @entity110 have unveiled a first class stamp to celebrate @entity12 's success ‘ it dawned on me that if @entity24 had been in my shoes there was no way he would have lost			1
it is a shame that we could not have two of us in here			0
‘ he has that real killer instinct which is why he has so many medals			2
' and my final ride was not that amazing if i am honest			0
i just let the crowd carry me home			0
’ @entity24 beat @entity12 in the 2008 final but after a rule change only one of them could represent @entity4 in @entity127			1
within moments of @entity12 ’s victory , @entity24 tweeted : ‘ that was phenomenal by @entity12			1
so happy and proud of him , well deserved mate			0
’ @entity12 overpowers @entity14 during race one of their @entity36 sprint final @entity9 's cycling kit has been the subject of allegation by the director of the rival @entity7 team somewhat ironically , the manufacturer of @entity9 's wheels is a @entity7 company , which also supplies the @entity144 and @entity7 national teams			1
and the company concerned , @entity145 , has said all of the teams it supplies have exactly the same wheels			2
but this still has n't stopped the director of the @entity7 cycling team from suggesting that @entity9 's wheels are somehow ' magic '			1
' do they really have @entity145 wheels ? ' @entity37 has asked			2
an apparent partnership with @entity157 might well be the source of the @entity7 director 's ire			1
when asked about the exact specifications of the @entity40 cycling team 's kit , @entity164 , who is in charge of developing the technology used by the team , has said only that the kit is top of the range			1
@entity4 's cyclists , including @entity25 , pictured , have met with extraordinary success at @entity173 ' we make sure the riders have the very best equipment available to them , ' he told @entity7 newspaper @entity178 who asked about the allegations			1
@entity182 , head of @entity184 's research and development group known as the @entity185 , has laughed off the claims of magic wheels , however			1
he said : ' it makes me smile			0
we used those wheels in @entity191			0
' it 's the least technologically advanced piece of equipment that there is			0
it has n't changed since ' 96 when @entity145 introduced the five - spoke wheel , it 's still the standard now			0
' @entity182 declined to reveal the gains made by technology , but was at a loss to explain why rival nations are not following @entity4 's lead by doing research in wind tunnels			2
' i could quantify it , but i 'm not going to , ' @entity182 said			0
' all of the riders have been in a wind tunnel ... they 're the biggest lump , so they 've invested a lot of time sitting ( there )			0
' @entity24 's done eight - hour days sitting in a wind tunnel , helping us develop things and improving his own position			2
' ' the rest of the world has known since @entity79 - well , they should 've known forever - aerodynamics is a massive part of our sport , ' he said			0
