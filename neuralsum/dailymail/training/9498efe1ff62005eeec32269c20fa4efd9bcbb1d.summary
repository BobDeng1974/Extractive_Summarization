a woman who claims @entity1 groped her in the @entity2 is lashing out at his wife @entity3 for conducting a ' war ' on the women who have accused the former president of sexually assaulting them			1
' she enabled his behavior , ' @entity7 said sunday night during a radio interview on @entity10 in @entity11 , and then ' attacked all the women who just made the mistake of walking in front of him , crossing his path			1
' @entity7 claims mrs. @entity3 , the former @entity17 secretary of state , has orchestrated a series of investigations designed to discredit the many women who have claimed her husband sexually assaulted them			1
' the point is what this woman is capable of doing to other women while she 's running a campaign , basically , on women 's issues , ' she said			2
' it just does n't make any sense			0
' ' she singlehandedly orchestrated every one of the investigations of all these women			0
' @entity7 said the president groped her after she approached him for a paying job in the @entity2 instead of her volunteer position @entity7 ( @entity38 ) and @entity39 ( r ) both claim @entity1 sexually assaulted them			1
@entity39 's allegations include her insistence that the former president raped her in 1978 , but she has changed her story several times @entity7 describes a 1990s @entity46 where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations she suspects @entity3 of covering up ' nothing short of serious sexual harassment ' in her case			1
and addressing claims by some @entity57 that @entity59 politicians are conducting a so - called ' war on women ' through their social policies , @entity7 turned the notion on its head			1
' @entity3 is the war on women , and that 's what needs to be exposed here ! ' she exclaimed			1
@entity69 first reported that @entity7 told @entity10 host @entity70 that mrs. @entity3 is ' addicted to power , and she saw early on that [ @entity1 ] could be a powerful candidate			1
he had a lot of charisma			0
and she could just ride on his coattails			0
' talking about the her allegations against @entity1 , she reiterated sunday that ' the president sexually assaulted me , ' leading her to ' the little room where he and @entity81 [ @entity82 ] used to meet			2
' ' i started to go for the door and he was right behind me , ' she recalled , ' and things went from bad to worse there			0
he acted just very inappropriately			0
i was shocked and bewildered , and i thought to myself , " what in the world is he doing ? " ' @entity7 claims @entity1 , an old friend whose @entity90 campaign organization she and her husband founded , ' was very intense			1
he 's much bigger than i am			0
' @entity7 describes a 1990s @entity46 where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations @entity7 describes a 1990s @entity46 where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations following @entity7 's news - making allegations in 1998 on the @entity105 program @entity104 , the @entity46 released a series of letters and phone messages , sent after the alleged 1993 sexual harassment , which seemed to show @entity7 had a friendly outlook toward the president , and wanted more contact – not less			1
a federal judge later ruled that president @entity1 had ' committed a criminal violation ' of the @entity115 by making her letters public			2
he was not prosecuted for it			0
and @entity118 , a one - time friend of @entity1 paramour @entity82 , testified in a grand jury proceeding that @entity7 pursued @entity1 , and not the other way around			1
but @entity7 maintains that she was a victim , and has even claimed the @entity122 had her second husband murdered on november 29 , 1993 , the same day the president allegedly forced himself on her			2
the death was ruled a suicide , but she said sunday that twenty years later government agencies refuse to let her see files detailing the investigation			0
@entity7 was a prolific @entity57 fundraiser who co-founded @entity131 to help get him elected , but she would later turn on him after what she says was a sexual assault near the @entity136 the botched @entity138 terror - attack aftermath is n't the only hurdle between @entity3 and the @entity2 : foreign powers may believe she can be deceived and fooled because her husband was a serial cheater @entity143 @entity59 sen. @entity59 , an all - but - certain presidential contender , said in january that although @entity1 's presidency was marked by ' predatory behavior , it 's not fair to blame his wife for letting it continue			1
' it ’s not @entity3 's fault , ' he told @entity152 magazine , ' but it is a factor in judging @entity1 in history ... sometimes it 's hard to separate one from the other			1
' @entity7 had no problem focusing her venom on @entity3 , though			2
it 's her likely presidential candidacy that 's bringing the former president 's sexual flings back into the news			0
' just pack your bags			0
you ’ve had your 15 minutes , ' she slapped at @entity3			2
' stop forcing us to have to look at this stuff again			0
we 're sick of it			0
' but @entity7 also had harsh words for feminist groups that seem insistent on making mrs. @entity3 the first female @entity17 president			1
' all of these women 's groups , they 're all pro-hillary , ' she said			2
' they need to ... talk to someone like me and listen here , what @entity3 has done to me and many , many , many other women			2
' ' they are so hypocritical , it 's unbelievable , ' she claimed			0
' and this is the woman that wants to be president			0

@entity7 was a @entity57 fundraiser volunteering in the @entity2 when she says @entity1 *kissed* her *passionately* and groped her
she claims @entity3 ran an investigation and smear campaign aimed at discrediting her , and claims she did it to *countless* other women
@entity3 ' enabled his behavior , ' @entity7 charged in an interview , ' and attacked all the women who just made the mistake of walking in front of him '
she also claims the draft of her *memoirs* were stolen from her house and blames the @entity1 's circle of friends
@entity7 wants feminist groups to *acknowledge* ' what @entity3 has done to me and many , many , many other women '
