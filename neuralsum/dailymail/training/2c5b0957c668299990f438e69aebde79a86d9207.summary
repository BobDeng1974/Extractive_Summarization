by @entity0 when @entity2 star @entity1 found a lump in her breast , she was just 21			1
a diagnosis of breast cancer made her one of the youngest people ever to fall prey to the disease			1
but after a gruelling regime of surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy she was later given the all - clear			2
now 36 , she is helping to raise awareness of the disease in young women and the importance of checking for lumps by taking part in a charity concert tonight			1
survivor : @entity2 star @entity1 , now 36 , was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 21 terrifying : @entity1 aged 21 , just before being diagnosed with breast cancer a special one - off concert , busting to @entity27 , will see her take to the stage with @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 to name but a few			1
breast cancer is the most common form of the disease in the @entity35 , with an estimated 48,000 women diagnosed each year according to the @entity37			1
but approximately 80 per cent of breast cancer diagnoses in women are in the over- 50s age group , which is why when @entity42 discovered a lump on her breast 15 years ago , she was so shocked			1
' i was really surprised , ' she says of the fateful moment she discovered the lump in her breast			0
' it was something i did n't know could happen to someone at that age			0
' i was away singing in a tour called @entity53 and it was if it had just appeared overnight - i was n't checking my breasts at all			2
' concerned , she rushed to see her gp as soon as she was home but was initially fobbed off and told it was a lump , but not of the sort to worry about			0
but @entity1 felt something was wrong and asked to have the lump removed			2
' i had it out a couple of weeks later , ' she explains			0
' the day that i came back to have my stitches removed , they told me it was cancer			0
then they gave me another operation to remove more tissue and some lymph nodes			0
' so began her battle against the disease , starting with a six - week course of radiotherapy followed by a gruelling seven cycles of chemotherapy			0
instead of pursuing her acting career and enjoying twenty - something life with friends , @entity1 was constantly exhausted and sick from the treatment and spent more time in hospital beds than in clubs			1
' you want to be looking and feeling amazing , ' she remembers			0
' you want to feel on top of your game and full of beans			0
people were going out and it felt like i was missing out			0
' performing : @entity31 ( left ) is on the line - up for the @entity94 ! concert as is @entity29 dream come true : @entity1 will duet with classical baritone @entity30 during tonight 's concert campaigner : @entity1 is now an ambassador for breast cancer charity , @entity94 ! luckily for @entity1 , the cancer had been caught early and after four years of hospital checks , she was finally given the all - clear and told that she did n't need to return			1
' it was a bit scary , ' she remembers			0
' it 's quite reassuring to be told you 're ok every few months			0
' but although @entity1 was lucky , others have n't been so fortunate , among them @entity108 , 19 , who died earlier this month from cervical cancer after doctors refused her a smear test			2
@entity1 , who is now an ambassador for breast cancer charity @entity94 ! , says its crucial that young women remember to check themselves and understand that , although rare , they too can get cancer			1
' to other women , i 'd say it can happen to you , breast cancer does younger women so keep checking yourself , get to know about it and what the symptoms are			1
' she hopes too , that the busting to sing concert will help make a difference and encourage more people to check their breasts			1
' we 've got such an awesome , fantastic line - up , ' she enthuses			0
' who knew that @entity132 from @entity133 [ @entity31 ] was such a good jazz singer ? ' we 've got @entity30 , @entity29 , @entity134 and @entity135 so its just going to be brilliant			1
' pausing for breath , she adds : ' i 'm going to be singing as well and doing duet from @entity141 with @entity30			2
