despair : support for @entity2 has slumped as today he is attacked by left - wing magazine the @entity3 as an ' old - style @entity5 socialist ' @entity2 is today attacked as an ‘ old - style @entity5 socialist ’ and a ‘ quasi @entity7 ’ by the house journal of the @entity9 amid evidence that @entity11 is losing even its ‘ core vote ’ which backed @entity13 in 2010			1
it comes as a new analysis shows @entity11 ’s support has slumped by between eight and ten percentage points over the last 18 months , prompting mounting alarm among its mps about the prospects of election victory			1
and last night there were rumours swirling at @entity24 that a letter calling on mr @entity2 to go was being prepared by some @entity19			0
one source said the move was being seriously considered amid despair at his leadership , though the plot is unlikely to take off with the general election only months away and little agreement among @entity11 critics over who should replace mr @entity2			1
in another blow to the @entity11 leader , former cabinet minister @entity37 said the party needed more ‘ realism ’ over the state of the public finances and poured scorn on the idea it could pay for its plans simply by raising taxes on the wealthy			1
today , in a scathing editorial , the @entity3 , which is traditionally supportive of @entity11 , warns that mr @entity2 ’s approach is haemorrhaging support on the @entity9 to the @entity50 and the @entity51			1
the magazine says the @entity11 leader appears a product of his ‘ narrow background ’ and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle - class aspiration			1
@entity57 , editor of the @entity3 , one of only two national publications to back mr @entity2 over his brother @entity60 for the @entity11 leadership in 2010 , said he appeared ‘ very much an old - style @entity5 socialist ’			1
‘ he does n’t really understand the lower middle - class or material aspiration , ’ he writes			0
‘ he does n’t understand @entity66 or woman			0
politics for him must seem at times like an extended @entity70 seminar : elevated talk about political economy and the good society			0
’ he adds : ‘ @entity2 has a deterministic , @entity75 analysis of our present ill. the @entity79 insurgency , @entity81 nationalism , the hollowing out of political parties , @entity85 radicalisation , the loathing and distrust of elites : all are manifestations of a failed economic model			2
’ @entity37 , left , with @entity92 : former cabinet minister mr @entity37 said @entity11 needed more ‘ realism ’ over the state of the public finances and poured scorn on plans to raise taxes on the wealthy according to a devastating analysis by the left - wing @entity101 , there has now been a fall in support among the party ’s 2010 voters of four percentage points			1
its general secretary , @entity108 , said : ‘ a drop like this was meant to be impossible			0
all through the parliament , the @entity11 hierarchy assumed that anyone who voted @entity13 in 2010 would surely stick in 2015			1
well it turns out you ca n’t take anyone for granted			0
’ @entity11 has only a fragile lead in a string of key marginal seats which will be wiped out if @entity79 voters can be won over by the @entity122 , a poll indicated yesterday			1
the latest survey of @entity122 / @entity11 battlegrounds by pollster @entity125 confirmed that , by splitting the @entity122 vote , @entity79 is on course to hand a general election victory to @entity2			1
however , @entity11 ’s lead in the constituencies was slender , suggesting there is all to play for in next year ’s election			1
the poll indicated the @entity122 message of ‘ vote @entity136 , get @entity2 ’ could be effective			2
lord @entity125 said increasing numbers of voters were backing mr @entity139 as their preferred prime minister			2
overall , 30 per cent were satisfied with his performance , and 29 per cent said they were dissatisfied but still preferred him to mr @entity2			0
extraordinarily , 30 per cent of @entity11 voters said they wanted mr @entity139 to remain in @entity145			1
just 34 per cent of @entity79 voters want to see @entity11 in government , the poll found			1
some 78 per cent of those who have currently switched from the @entity122 to @entity79 want the @entity149 in government			0
lord @entity125 said : ‘ the @entity149 can afford to lose no more than 21 seats to labour if they are to remain the largest party			0
’ but mr @entity108 said @entity11 still remained best placed to win next may because of the split in the right - wing vote caused by @entity79			1
one senior mp suggested that mr @entity2 should abandon @entity24 , apart from for prime minister ’s questions , and go on a tour of the country to try to revive his faltering leadership – a tactic adopted in the 1980s by then @entity163 leader @entity162			2
but the mp doubted that the @entity11 leader had the will to do so , concluding : ‘ his confidence has gone			1
it ’s like a light ’s gone out			0
’ a shadow cabinet minister said : ‘ morale has never been lower … we ’re all very , very concerned			2
the reality is that whilst we do n’t have a presidential system , people are thinking increasingly about who they want to be the prime minister			2
’ former cabinet minister @entity37 was critical of @entity11 ’s plans to reintroduce @entity13 ’s short - lived 50p top rate of tax if it regains power next year			1
mr @entity37 , the party ’s election co-ordinator at the 2005 election , said the 50p tax rate would be ‘ absolutely incidental , by the way , to the state of the public finances ’ , adding : ‘ let ’s not kid ourselves			1
’ in a recording of an event at @entity11 ’s annual conference , he said big spending plans would not be possible ‘ in the bad times ’			1
‘ so all i ’m saying to you as fellow party members is that we need a note of realism and we need a note of edge as we go into the next general election , ’ he added			0
an abridged version of @entity3 editor @entity57 's withering analysis of @entity2 @entity2 is very much an old - style @entity5 socialist			1
he does n’t really understand the lower middle class or material aspiration			0
he does n’t understand @entity66 or woman			0
politics for him must seem at times like an extended @entity70 seminar : elevated talk about political economy and the good society			0
at present , he and @entity11 seem trapped			1
his mps sense it and the polls reflect it			0
@entity79 is attracting support in the party ’s old working - class northern @entity220 heartlands and winning converts in key @entity224 swing seats that @entity11 would once have hoped to win			1
in @entity81 the @entity51 has become the natural party of government			2
@entity2 is losing the support of the @entity9 ( to the @entity51 , to the @entity50 ) without having formed a broader coalition of a kind that defined the early @entity230 years			1
most damaging , i think , is that he seldom seems optimistic about the country he wishes to lead			0
@entity2 speaks too often of struggle and failure , of people as victims – and it ’s true that life is difficult for many			0
but a nation also wants to feel good about itself and to know in which direction it is moving			0
@entity2 does not have a compelling personal story to tell the electorate , as @entity245 did about her remarkable journey from the grocer ’s shop in @entity250 and the values that sustained her along the way or @entity253 does about his rise from an impoverished childhood in west @entity256			0
“ i went to @entity257 to study @entity70 , worked for @entity13 , became a cabinet minister and then leader of the party ” does not quite do it			2
none of this would matter were @entity2 in manner and approach not so much the product of this narrow background			0
@entity2 ’s chief problem is not policy but tone			0
he needs to find a distinctive voice to articulate people ’s feelings about the present moment			0
and he might have to accept before long – or the electorate will force him to – that @entity275 ’ s social - democratic moment , if it ever existed , is fading into the past			0
@entity2 's poll guru parachutes in guru : @entity279 was parachuted into the shadow cabinet last night in an attempt to turn around the party ’s faltering efforts to win next year ’s election the mp who ran @entity2 ’s @entity11 leadership campaign was parachuted into the shadow cabinet last night in an attempt to turn around the party ’s faltering efforts to win next year ’s election			1
in what appeared to be a snub to shadow foreign secretary @entity292 , who is in charge of the campaign , @entity279 was brought in to a new position as his ‘ vice chair ’ and shadow cabinet office minister			2
@entity11 officials said she would take ‘ day - to - day control ’ , while mr @entity292 would continue to be responsible for ‘ strategy ’			2
the reshuffle was prompted by the resignation of shadow international development secretary @entity303 , who is bidding to lead the party in @entity81			0
to the surprise of @entity24 observers , who rate her as one of the more effective @entity11 frontbenchers , @entity305 was demoted from shadow transport secretary to replace mr @entity303			2
her transport brief went to @entity312 , a former spin doctor for @entity13 who was shadow cabinet office minister			0
@entity11 said @entity313 , a former adviser to president @entity314 hired at great expense by @entity11 to advise on the election campaign , will be visiting the @entity317 shortly to shore up mr @entity2			2
there has been growing sniping about mr @entity313 ’s role , since he did not attend @entity11 ’s annual conference in september and is rumoured to have become disillusioned about his advice being ignored .			2

withering analysis comes amid evidence @entity11 is losing its ' core vote '
@entity51 's support has *plunged* as much as 10 percentage points in 18 months
