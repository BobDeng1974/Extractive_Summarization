@entity0 will have his first tangible crack at @entity3 's vacant 13 shirt on saturday after being paired alongside @entity4 in midfield to face @entity6			1
the @entity8 era remains yet to launch at full - tilt however , as boss @entity9 still can not select from midfield strength			2
so with @entity11 sidelined through foot trouble , the wait to decipher head coach @entity9 's first - choice centre pairing goes on			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) will start alongside @entity4 for @entity3 against @entity6 on saturday @entity16 and @entity17 are the only two starters retained from last weekend 's 49 - 7 victory over @entity20 , with @entity3 back to full strength to face @entity22 's @entity6			1
fit - again hooker @entity23 returns to the front - row , while @entity25 returns at flanker given @entity27 could be recuperating from his brain injury for some time			0
@entity29 stalwart @entity4 missed the autumn 's opening clash against the @entity32 with calf trouble , with @entity34 's @entity11 limping out of that 29 - 15 victory in the closing stages			2
the net result of the various midfield injuries and chopping and changing for the visit of @entity20 mean the jury could still be out on @entity3 's first - choice centre pairing			0
@entity44 battering ram @entity0 slotted into 12 against @entity32 , but now has his chance in his more natural outside - centre berth			1
@entity0 will get a chance in his natural position after starting at 12 against @entity32 @entity3 boss @entity9 can keep his cards close to his chest until the @entity52 then , on just who will be anointed as the now - retired @entity8 's long - term successor			1
@entity0 produced a gritty defensive display in his first cap on @entity58 soil against the @entity32 , leaving @entity9 to ask for more of the same against @entity6			1
' i do n't know if you can ask too much more of @entity0 , ' said @entity9			1
' i thought he delivered a really solid performance against @entity32			0
' it was very seamless , him moving into 12			0
' at 13 there will be some different challenges : @entity66 will be coming into that area , there will be some traffic for @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , @entity4 and @entity0 to cope with			1
@entity3 head coach @entity9 was impressed with @entity0 's performance against @entity32 ' @entity0 must also link with the wingers and that will be another challenge for him			1
' @entity0 and @entity4 spent a bit of time together when @entity4 got back fully fit			1
' they 've had a little bit of time together , they 've enjoyed two training sessions together this week , that 's pretty much all we 've had time to do			0
' i 'm just hoping they can feed off each other , connect and link really well , and make sure there 's no space for some of those big @entity90 runners to come through			0
' if they do that really well they 'll have had a pretty good day at the office			0
' @entity3 star @entity70 plays a pass during his country 's training session in @entity97 former @entity29 boss @entity9 has warned @entity3 they must fight for the right foundations before trying to launch their offloading game			0
' i hope we get more ball than against @entity32 : when you are struggling to win the ball and win collisions it 's hard to get the offloading game going , ' said @entity9			0
' @entity110 only works when you 're going forward			0
' we 've seen @entity0 and @entity4 get good balls away through the contact , so if that 's something we can manufacture , get that front foot ball , then i 'd be delighted if that allowed them to open up the game a little bit			2
