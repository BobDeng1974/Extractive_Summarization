the life span of a lake fly is *extremely* short with many living for just a few days after hatching
on the ground a *countless* number of dead flies are *visible*
normally the flies hatch around @entity16 , but the cold this year delayed their arrival
unlike *mosquitoes* , lake flies are harmless to humans
they also serve as a *valuable* food source for hundreds of other species that live in the lake
