the @entity1 administration quietly announced on tuesday that it intends to change the way @entity3 learn about natural disasters and other major emergencies during radio and tv broadcasts , giving the president the ability to flip a switch and address the entire nation at once			1
the @entity12 , the latest version of a program first established in 1951 , blasts out emergency messages in the event of local weather emergencies , but can also be used to warn @entity3 about terror attacks and major natural disasters			1
every broadcaster in the country is required to participate in the @entity12			1
messages travel along a closed , private network , piggybacking from station to station			1
it can take up to 10 minutes for every radio , tv , cable and satellite provider to blare its alert			2
television screens display text messages during @entity12 events , and could be used by future @entity35 for a variety of purposes most messages in the system are restricted to specific states , counties or other geographic areas			2
but now the @entity43 has filed public notice of a rule change that would bypass the daisy - chain entirely and give the federal government instant access to all the nation 's airwaves at once , in the event of a national emergency			1
some @entity53 fear a system that would give the @entity55 a way to address the entire country at will could be abused			1
' oh , great , ' a @entity53 @entity59 staffer told @entity60 on tuesday			2
' @entity61 is talking to you			2
' ' call me crazy , but i have a feeling we 're going to see the definition of an " emergency " get looser and looser â€“ especially as we get closer to an election			0
' the @entity43 's plan could also make the national @entity12 vulnerable to the sort of hacking that embarrassed broadcasters in @entity73 a year ago			1
in july 2013 hackers there gained access to an @entity12 signal and broadcast a phony alert about a zombie apocalypse on a string of @entity82 television affiliates owned by the @entity83			1
' civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living , ' the fictitious message said			0
' follow the messages onscreen that will be updated as information becomes available			0
do not attempt to approach or apprehend these bodies as they are considered extremely dangerous			0
' at least one radio station in @entity96 also fell prey to the hack			2
instant access : @entity1 and future @entity3 presidents will have the ability to flip a switch and address the entire nation at will the congressional aide also said that with more and more @entity3 going online for information , social media is already replacing broadcast emergency messages as the best way to spread urgent news			1
' if we have another 9/11 , the people who hear about it through an @entity12 message are going to be the last to know , ' he said			0
' by the time you hear that annoying " buzz " sound on the radio , all your friends will have tweeted about it			0
but according to a notice published tuesday in the @entity122 , the government continues to rely on @entity12 as its primary means of alerting @entity3 about emergencies in real time			0
@entity126 reported that the @entity43 believes the new system will help with ' saving human lives , reducing injuries , mitigating property damage , and minimizing the disruption of the national economy			0
' most messages sent through the @entity12 are periodic tests designed to condition @entity3 to what a real alert would look and sound like			1
the government has tested the system on a national basis just once , in november 2011			0
the @entity43 also has a separate public alert system for smartphones in the works			0
it was first tested in 2013 on a statewide basis but has n't been fully deployed .			0

@entity55 wants to be able to instantly talk to the entire country in the event of a terror attack of major natural disaster
*current* ' @entity12 ' relies on each radio or tv station to *forward* emergency messages to the next broadcaster in a chain
the @entity1 administration instead wants the power to flip a switch and *override* the entire @entity12 network , speaking instantly on every public broadcast at once
' @entity61 is talking to you , ' warned a senior @entity53 congressional staffer . ' this is just *begging* to be abused '
hackers gained access to an @entity12 signal in @entity73 last year , broadcasting a phony alert about a zombie apocalypse
