by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 13:35 est , 2 october 2012 archaeologists who are digging for the remains of the real - life @entity3 have found a female skeleton - but sadly they do not believe these are bones of @entity8 's muse			1
researcher @entity12 , leading the digs under a former convent in central @entity11 , believes the body he has found is that of a woman who lived decades after @entity16 , the woman many experts believe sat for @entity8 's iconic painting			1
so far the team - who have been criticised in some corners for their methodology - have discovered four remains under the convent			1
an archaeologist digs away at the floor of the medieval convent of @entity29 in @entity11 , where the skeleton was discovered the convent was the burial site of @entity16 , wife of the wealthy @entity11 silk merchant @entity16 , who modelled for @entity8 bodies were buried one on top of the other at the convent - so the team will keep digging , and reaching further back in history			1
@entity12 told reporters : ' the ledgers kept by the nuns of this convent tell us that , presumably , the remains exhumed today are those of @entity45 , a wealthy woman who ( died ) in 1609			2
' but he added that he hoped ' @entity3 's ' bones ' could be right here '			2
@entity49 , was the wife of a rich silk merchant named @entity16			0
in @entity51 the @entity3 is known as @entity3			0
@entity52 : the enigmatic @entity3 has intrigued millions most modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the @entity3 was @entity16 , who became a nun after her husband 's death			0
she died in the convent on july 15 , 1542 , aged 63			0
an archeological team began digging at the abandoned convent of @entity29 last year			1
they first had to dig through thick concrete , laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks			0
if they do find the body of @entity16 , the team hopes to extract her dna to confirm her identity - comparing it to the dna of her two children buried elsewhere			1
then they will use facial reconstruction techniques to compare her face to that of the iconic painting			0
however some researchers have criticised the research , saying the pace of the expedition means error may be made - such as the team not mapping out where bones and other items are found , ruining evidence such as the spatial relationships between different bodies			2
@entity93 quoted @entity95 anthropologist @entity94 , who said : ' although the excavation is being carried out in a professional manner , @entity12 ’s quest to dig up the " real " @entity3 is not grounded in scientific research methodology			0
; the news media ’s breathless coverage of it threatens to signal to the public that archaeologists are frivolous with their time , energy and research money			0
' resting place : the courtyard of the @entity29 convent in @entity11 , where archaeologists have been digging			1

research team aims to keep digging *beneath* convent in central @entity11 in hopes of finding @entity8 's muse
