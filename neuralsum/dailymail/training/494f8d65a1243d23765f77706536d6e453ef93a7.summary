by @entity0 last updated at 1:25 am on 16th july 2011 in 1981 , @entity1 could not have been happier as they triumphed in the @entity3 with @entity4 and their iconic skirt - ripping routine			1
fast forward 30 years and relations between the four members are decidedly colder			1
yesterday three of them , @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 , sat in the austere surroundings of a hearings room at the @entity15 in @entity16 , which rules on copyright and trademark issues			2
they currently perform under the name @entity11 it is a far cry from the glitzy world of @entity30 they once inhabited			2
they were there for a legal battle with the fourth member of the original line - up , @entity37 , over the right to use the name			1
the two camps are no longer on speaking terms			2
yesterday @entity37 appeared via video link from 150 miles away in @entity43 , @entity44 , as it was closer to his @entity47 home			2
line - up : three of the original @entity1 , @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 , arrive at the @entity51 offices			2
the case will be decided towards the end of next month @entity37 – real name @entity37 – has continued to perform under the name @entity1 with new members ever since the last of the other originals left 14 years ago			1
determined : @entity37 , real name @entity37 , believes he has the right to the @entity1 trademark and is fighting his former bandmates his wife @entity61 , who has been in the group for 18 years , owns the trademark			1
singers @entity65 and @entity66 complete the line - up			2
but @entity9 , 57 , @entity11 , 56 , and @entity12 , 49 , who have been reunited as a trio since 2009 , want to call themselves @entity11 and trademark that name			0
@entity37 , 53 , objected , saying it infringed his trademark , so @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 are now asking for it to be revoked			0
yesterday the trio ’s solicitor @entity75 said the use of the name @entity1 by @entity37 ‘ misleads ’ the public			0

some fans are said to have asked ‘ where ’s @entity9 ? ’ when they bought tickets to see @entity37 ’s group			0
mr @entity75 also gave examples of adverts for @entity37 ’s act which used a photo of the original band			1
he said : ‘ the public perception of the words @entity1 is simply the band that consisted of my three clients as well			1
’ the name @entity1 was originally registered by the @entity104 , the company the band was first signed to			1
in 1990 the trademark expired			0
@entity37 ’s side registered it in 2001 after a legal dispute with @entity11			0
