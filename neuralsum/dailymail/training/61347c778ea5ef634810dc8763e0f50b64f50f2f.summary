by @entity1 reporter published : 17:06 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 18:32 est , 11 september 2012 the parents of drum major @entity3 were left ‘ appalled ’ after @entity4 concluded that the 26 - year - old student was at fault for his own death in last year ’s hazing incident			1
in legal papers filed on monday , the university maintained that it was champion , not the school , who bears the ultimate responsibility for his death			0
champion died last november after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed marching 100 band aboard a charter bus parked outside an @entity20 hotel			1
the university asserts that the 26 - year - old champion was a top leader in the band and he should have refused to take part in the hazing ritual			1
scroll down to watch video blame game : @entity4 concluded that drum major @entity3 was at fault for his hazing death last year ‘ no public university or college has a legal duty to protect an adult student from the result of their own decision to participate in a dangerous activity while off - campus and after retiring from university - sponsored events , ’ states the lengthy filing by @entity38 , an attorney with the @entity40 law firm hired by @entity4			1
instead , the university maintains that @entity47 — who it says witnessed others being hazed that night on the bus — consented to the hazing ritual in order to gain respect among fellow band members			1
because of that , @entity4 wants a judge to throw out the lawsuit filed against the university by @entity47 's family or at least delay action on it until criminal charges against @entity59 band members are resolved			1
the family also sued the owner and driver of the charter bus where the ritual took place			0
‘ under these circumstances , @entity69 's taxpayers should not be held financially liable to mr. @entity3 's estate for the ultimate result of his own imprudent , avoidable and tragic decision and death , ’ states the motion filed by the university			2
however , @entity47 's parents and their attorney disagree			2
life cut short : champion , 26 , passed away after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed marching 100 band aboard a bus ‘ no , he was on the clock , ’ attorney @entity82 told @entity83			1
‘ this is a school sanctioned event			0
it 's in a bus they chartered , at a hotel they designated for him to stay at exclusively with members and staff of this institution			0
’ the legal filing represents the first formal response that the university has made in the wake of @entity47 's death , which led to arrests of band members , the suspension of the famed band for this football season and the resignation of the school 's president			1
twelve former members have pleaded not guilty to charges of felony hazing			0
the suit was brought by @entity3 and @entity47 of @entity112 , @entity113			1
university trustees had discussed trying to mediate the lawsuit , but @entity4 's response may have doomed that effort			0
‘ it 's startling that they would blame the victim for his own death , ’ @entity82 said			1
‘ @entity4 is pointing the finger at everyone else but themselves , including their own students			0
’ the lawyer added that the lawsuit needs to go forward so that the university is held accountable for tolerating a culture of hazing that went unchecked for years			0
appalled : champions ' parents , @entity3 , left , and @entity47 , right , as well as their attorney @entity82 , center , said they are determined to pursue their lawsuit against @entity4 ‘ someone has got to hold @entity4 accountable , ’ @entity82 said monday			1
‘ we are now more committed than ever to litigate this case to clear @entity3 's name and eradicate the culture of hazing for the safety of future students			2
’ the university 's motion also notes that @entity47 signed a hazing and @entity149 prior to his death in which he acknowledged the ‘ dangers of participating in hazing , either as a hazer or a hazee			1
’ @entity82 , however , called the reference to the agreement a ‘ tongue - in - cheek ’ move on the part of @entity4			2
ousted : @entity4 president @entity159 reached an agreement with school officials to immediately resign from his post ‘ everyone signed that agreement , but they also knew that unless you were hazed , you were n't accepted , ’ he said			0
the @entity131 claim university officials did not take action to stop hazing even though a school dean proposed suspending the band because of hazing three days before their son died			0
in its response the university denied that any specific proposal or recommendation was made regarding suspending the band prior to @entity47 's death			2
the @entity179 lawsuit also noted that school officials allowed nonstudents to play in the band and asserts that school officials fell short in enforcing anti-hazing policies and did not keep a close eye on band members to prevent hazing			1
the university in the last several months has instituted a long list of new policies , including limiting the @entity59 to just @entity4 students and putting in new academic policies			0
beginning in spring 2013 , students will be required to sign an anti-hazing pledge before they 're allowed to register for classes			0
the @entity195 still has a pending probe into whether university officials had ignored past warnings about problems with hazing at @entity4			0
hundreds of pages of records reviewed earlier this year by the @entity203 showed years of repeated warnings about brutal hazing passed without any serious response from the school 's leadership until @entity47 died			2
reforms : the university has instituted a long list of new policies , including limiting the @entity59 to just @entity4 students and putting in new academic policies unfortunately your browser does not support @entity215 .			0

@entity3 , 26 , died last november after being beaten to death by fellow band members
attorney representing the @entity179 family said it was ' startling ' that @entity4 ' would blame the victim for his own death '
@entity4 says @entity47 was an adult who should have refused to take part in the hazing
