it would make @entity2 's recent cold weather seem like a heatwave			2
scientists have discovered the coldest place on @entity6 - where the air temperature plummets to below -91c			0
the newly - found spot - situated along an @entity10 mountain ridge - could freeze a human 's eyes , nose and lungs within minutes			1
record - breaking : scientists have discovered the coldest place on @entity6 along an @entity10 mountain ridge - where the temperature plummets to below a deadly @entity8 ( file picture ) this is because its temperature is almost 13 degrees below the point at which @entity22 transforms from a gas into dry ice ( -78.5c )			1
the record - breaking discovery was made by researchers from @entity28 's @entity27 and @entity29 , according to @entity30			2
they used satellites and other techniques to measure temperatures in @entity10			1
the -91.2c spot - one of numerous cold places recorded on the mountain ridge - is believed to have been found at heights of more than 12,400ft on a mountain called @entity40			1
astonishingly , it is even chillier than @entity44 's @entity43 research station , where the world 's previous coldest air temperature ( -89.2c ) was recorded during the @entity10 winter of 1983			1
previous record holder : the spot is even chillier than @entity44 's @entity43 research station , pictured , where the world 's previous coldest air temperature ( -89.2c ) was recorded in 1983 and researchers say there are probably even colder spots - with the satellite only averaging the temperature over a square kilometre			1
' it is likely that record cold sites identified by the data have small areas within them that are significantly colder than the grid cell mean , ' said a data centre researcher in a published summary of the findings			0
he added that the coldest temperatures had been recorded during clear , dry periods - as opposed to on windy or snowy days			2
full details of the scientists ' discovery will be revealed at the @entity74 's annual meeting this week			2
earlier this year , the @entity44 village of @entity76 was revealed to be the coldest permanently inhabited settlement in the world - with the average temperature for january standing at -50c			0
chilly : a woman walks in @entity76 , @entity44 , which is the world 's coldest permanently inhabited settlement known as the ' @entity86 ' , the coldest ever temperature recorded in @entity76 was -71.2c			0
the village , which is home to around 500 people , was , in the 1920s and 1930s , a stopover for reindeer herders who would water their flocks from the thermal spring			0
a single shop provides the town 's bare necessities - with he locals working as reindeer - breeders , hunters and ice - fisherman			0
in comparison , the coldest temperature @entity2 has ever seen is @entity106 , which was recorded in 1995 at @entity107 in the @entity108 .			0

spot on @entity10 mountain ridge sees temperatures of below @entity8
conditions could freeze a human 's eyes , nose and lungs within minutes
