locked in a tight embrace on the slopes of the @entity9 ski resort yesterday , prince @entity4 and his society girlfriend @entity5 seem to be closer than ever			1
the very public display of affection , in front of dozens of fellow skiers , came only a few hours after even more intimate revelries at a restaurant in the town			0
it was not a wild night by @entity4 ’s standards ; no one was naked or wearing @entity21 fancy dress			1
bear hug : locked in a tight embrace on the slopes of the @entity9 ski resort yesterday , prince @entity4 and his society girlfriend @entity5 seem to be closer than ever close : the very public display of affection , in front of dozens of fellow skiers , came only a few hours after even more intimate revelries at a restaurant in the town but fellow diners in the wee small hours at the @entity32 restaurant in the resort ’s @entity33 were entertained by the sight of the prince bouncing the 24 - year - old blonde model and would - be actress on his knee			1
the pair were said to have ‘ kissed like love - struck teenagers in the back of a cinema ’			1
the other end of the same table was an altogether more sober affair			0
@entity4 ’s uncle , prince @entity47 , whose 53rd birthday on tuesday they were celebrating , sat with his ex-wife , @entity51 , @entity52 , and their two daughters , @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity56 ’s boyfriend , @entity57 , briefly strolled over chatted to @entity4 and @entity58			1
but for the most part they had eyes only for each other			0
the @entity63 traditionally enjoy a week ’s skiing in the resort every year to mark prince @entity47 ’s birthday , often inviting photographers to capture the event			1
this time , perhaps not unsurprisingly , the invitation was not extended			0
the family had booked a table for 20 at @entity72 , where they ordered steak and king prawns and drank £ 17 champagne cocktails			0
in the spotlight : this week 's events in @entity9 could suggest that things are beginning to get serious between prince @entity4 and @entity5			1
the model is spotted out in @entity81 previously as the night drew on , @entity4 and his socialite girlfriend became increasingly tactile			2
shortly before midnight , miss @entity5 , who wore a minuscule black dress and heels , showing off a pair of endless legs , stood up and walked over to sit on @entity4 ’s lap. the pair then began to kiss , with @entity4 stroking the back of her head as they did so , in a passionate clinch for several minutes			1
a witness said : ‘ we could n’t believe what we were seeing			0
they were not being discreet about it			0
‘ @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity56 sat just a few seats away at the time and seemed to be deliberately looking the other way , making polite conversation while it was happening			0
‘ afterwards , @entity4 ’s girl stayed sitting on his knee while they chatted to his friends			1
’ the diner went on to reveal : ‘ at one point , a waiter brought over a tray of vodka and @entity115 and @entity4 shouted : “ free drinks on the house ! ” everyone seemed to be having a great time			1
’ although prince @entity47 left shortly afterwards , the younger royals went on to an exclusive bar above the restaurant , before moving to a basement nightclub , where they stayed until 3.30am			1
despite the late night , however , @entity4 and @entity58 still hit the slopes yesterday morning and were again seen openly hugging and kissing on the slopes , which were packed with half - term visitors			1
both appeared to be extremely competent skiers and spent most of the day on the mountain			0
pole to pole : @entity4 shows touching concern for his girlfriend on their romantic break at one point , taking a break from their fun , @entity4 was seen putting his arms around @entity58 ’s waist while she rested her head on his shoulder			2
the student , who wore a white woolly hat with a fur bobble and pink salopettes , appeared relaxed and could be seen laughing with the @entity52 as they left the slopes			0
she and @entity56 were also seen lying on the snow and giggling as they played with a large @entity151 dog			0
last summer ’s disastrous @entity153 stag trip , during which @entity4 , now 28 , was pictured naked — a faux pas which reportedly led to him being dumped briefly by a furious @entity58 — seems a very long time ago now			2
so , for that matter , does his previous , long - term relationship with the @entity157 heiress @entity156 , who dumped him in 2011 , reportedly because she could not face the prospect of being in the spotlight as a royal wife			0
since @entity153 , @entity4 , in his guise of captain @entity163 of the @entity165 , has served a four - month tour of @entity167 as a co-pilot in an @entity170 attack helicopter			2
at the end of his service he talked of having a new maturity			0
a few months earlier , he had complained on @entity175 television that he would like to settle down , but girls were put off by his royal status			0
so , do this week ’s events in @entity9 suggest matters are getting serious between him and the @entity181 - educated @entity180 ? the couple are said to have started dating last may , though they only appeared as an item on the public radar when pictured leaving a @entity187 nightclub in july			1
cosy chat : @entity98 of @entity99 , so long excluded from royal circles , has a heart - to - heart with @entity58 they had spent the evening ‘ kissing and cuddling ’ inside @entity193 after attending the latest @entity195 premiere			2
@entity4 ’s cousin and miss @entity5 ’s good friend @entity56 is said to have brought them together			1
the daughter of renowned @entity202 businessman @entity203 and @entity204 model @entity199 — who posed semi-naked for a coffee table photographic book and went on to get married and divorced four times — @entity58 is a familiar figure in @entity81 ’s upper - class social scene			2
as a teenager , she was labelled by society bible @entity211 as ‘ really pretty , really nice and absolutely obsessed with @entity213 ( the late @entity175 singer ) ’			2
after splitting up with miss @entity156 , @entity4 was linked to a string of women , including model @entity216			2
but @entity58 seems to be the one he has been most smitten with			0
split : prince @entity4 was previously in a long - term relationship with @entity156			1
the pair are pictured together in 2010 like miss @entity156 , ‘ @entity224 ’ went to @entity221 where she dated @entity222 , son of the @entity223			2
after graduation , that relationship cooled			0
now she has a prince in her life			0
last year she and @entity4 flew together to the @entity231 island of @entity232 for the birthday of tycoon sir @entity235 ’s son @entity234 , who is engaged to be married to miss @entity5 ’s beautiful half - sister , the actress @entity237			1
this week ’s ski holiday , to which the @entity4 had flown on budget airline @entity239 , is significant in royal terms for more than one reason			2
it is the first time in many , many years that @entity4 has been seen in public with the snubbed @entity99 ’s ex-wife			1
@entity51 was robustly frozen out by the @entity245 after being photographed having her toes sucked by her ‘ financial adviser ’ in the @entity248 , an incident which precipitated her divorce from prince @entity47			1
and despite enjoying a close relationship with @entity4 and his brother @entity253 while they were growing up , they had little to do with @entity51 after she fell out with their mother @entity255 , shortly before her death			0
@entity47 , however , has always championed his ex-wife and , despite the fact that she was pointedly not invited to the @entity99 and @entity52 of @entity261 ’s wedding , will no doubt be feeling pleased that his nephew @entity4 is rekindling their relationship once again , thanks to @entity58			1
so , a thaw in royal relations			0
miss @entity5 seems to be melting hearts .			0

prince @entity4 and @entity5 seemed closer than ever in @entity9
diners in resort ’s @entity33 amazed to see public intimacy between pair
they ‘ kissed like love - struck teenagers in the back of a cinema ’
it came during birthday celebration for @entity4 ’s uncle , prince @entity47
