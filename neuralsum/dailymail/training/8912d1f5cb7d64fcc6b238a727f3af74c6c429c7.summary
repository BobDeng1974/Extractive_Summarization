from @entity2 period , before species walked on land 370m years ago by @entity4 published : 09:12 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 29 march 2013 scientists have discovered a prehistoric species of armoured predatory fish with ' legs ' in a 370million year old fossil			1
archaeologists uncovered the ancient creature while studying sandstone deposits in a section of road in north central @entity15			1
it is believed to be from the late @entity2 period , at a time long before dinosaurs walked the @entity21 – but , geologically speaking , not long before the very first species began to walk on land			1
scientists have discovered a prehistoric species of armoured predatory fish with ' legs ' in a 370million year old fossil the creature is believed to be from the late @entity2 period , at a time long before dinosaurs walked the @entity21 fossils of armored fishes like this one , a phyllolepid placoderm , are known for the distinctive ornamentation of ' leg - like ' ridges on their exterior plates			1
using a method more familiar to crime scene investigators , dr @entity36 , of @entity37 , managed to create a copy of the fossil with a rubber cast made by pouring latex into its natural impression in the rock			0
this is a dorsal view of the dermal armor of the newly identified fossil fish species , @entity47 @entity48 is an extinct class of armoured prehistoric fish , known from fossils , which lived from the @entity52 to the end of the @entity2			1
their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species			0
placoderms were among the first jawed fish ; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches			0
a 380 - million - year - old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth this placoderm , named @entity47 , is one of two new @entity2 fish species presented by @entity36 in the @entity73 issue of the @entity74			2
the other new species is a lobe - finned fish discovered in northern @entity77			2
once the latex hardened , dr @entity36 peeled it out and dusted its surface with a fine powder to better show the edges of the bony plates and the shapes of fine ridges on the fish 's bony armor – a lot like dusting for fingerprints to show minute ridges left on a surface			0
dr @entity36 and colleagues were then better able to prepare a detailed scientific description of the new species dr @entity36 has dug for @entity2 species in @entity15 since 1993 , and in northern @entity77 since 1999			2
his work helps to explain how the first vertebrate species with limbs evolved			0
the @entity47 , species has been named in honor of dr. @entity102 , a colleague of dr @entity36 .			0
