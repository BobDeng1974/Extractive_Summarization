he flies around the world , designs all the presents , looks after the elves and checks the entire list - twice			0
but what would @entity5 earn for his dutiful work if he were paid a @entity9 salary ? according to a study , this year the big man would take home $ 139,924			1
though it falls short of the $ 1.8 billion that a third of people believe he should earn , it is in fact a 1.5 % increase on he would have got last year , up from $ 137,795			1
taking care of the reindeer , technically farm work , should technically merit $ 4,347 a year			1
and checking the list twice demands $ 537 annually , under a standard bookkeeping salary			2
they are three of just 15 lucrative jobs @entity5 dutifully carries out year by year , according to @entity36 's @entity35 2014			0
the study compiles a list of each job and values each one			0
it includes labor negotiator ( with the elves ) , sleigh pilot , and cookie taster - which falls under the category agricultural inspector			0
finding out if you 've been bad or good - and knowing exactly when you 're asleep or awake - merits a private detective salary of $ 777 a year , if he delivers a result in 30 days			1
tasks at hand : tending to the elves and running the workshop are his most lucrative jobs , a study says the insurance firm offered the data to 895 adults to see if they felt the salary is justified			1
while 29 % thought it was a pittance for the king of @entity23 , another 29 % felt he should get paid nothing for the charity			2
the estimated wage is almost five times the basic salary for imitation santas who work in malls and at kids parties			0
with an average wage of $ 20 an hour - though some get up to $ 300 an hour - most santas take home $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 a season			2
the study notes that @entity5 's wage is a touch more than his trusty deputy - the stay at home mom - would earn , and almost twice that earned by a stay at home dad .			0

a study calculated the value of each task into a wage of $ 139,924
*overseeing* the workshop makes him an industrial engineer worth $ 116,742
other tasks include cookie tasting , bookkeeping and private *investigation*
he got a 1.5 % raise this year but many @entity9 think he should *n't* be paid
