@entity6 ’s dangerous front three combined to put them in control of @entity2 , as @entity3 , finalists in 2013 , were punished for being wasteful in front of goal			1
@entity10 forward @entity9 put the hosts ahead in the first half , before @entity14 winger @entity13 provided for @entity15 to seal the result with a header 20 minutes from time			1
it puts @entity6 top of the group , after hosts @entity22 drew with @entity23 in the day ’s earlier game			1
@entity6 's @entity9 celebrates the opener against @entity3 in @entity26 , @entity22 the @entity28 star was on target to put his side top of @entity2 in the @entity31 2015 plenty of locals stayed behind in the @entity26 for the second game , and they saw @entity3 start the brighter			1
in fact , the @entity35 could easily have scored three or four in an open first half			0
@entity3 : @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 77 ) , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , ; @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity46 , @entity49 ; @entity50 @entity6 : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 ( @entity57 63 mins ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 83 ) ; @entity13 , @entity61 ( @entity62 87 ) , @entity63 booked : @entity64 40 , @entity13 53 goals : @entity66 19 , @entity67 72 @entity68 , the @entity69 winger on loan from @entity71 , was the beneficiary of a defensive mix - up , but his stinging volley was palmed away by @entity6 stopper @entity51			1
@entity74 was the next to be denied , a last - ditch block preventing him from getting a shot away when well - placed inside the penalty area			0
the pace of @entity79 was a constant threat in behind , and in the 19th minute he escaped the @entity6 defence and skipped around @entity51 , but , having been forced wide , was unable to find a team - mate			2
just seconds later , @entity3 ’s wastefulness was punished			2
@entity85 slid a lovely ball down the right hand channel for @entity6 ’s @entity10 star @entity9 , who gave @entity50 a lesson in staying calm in front of goal			1
@entity6 's @entity91 ( centre ) rises the highest to head in his side 's second goal of the game although @entity9 ’s first shot was saved , he took his time with the rebound , commiting the covering defenders before firing into the roof of the net for his sixth goal in his last four games for @entity6			2
@entity50 , the leading goalscorer in all @entity31 qualifying , continued to have chances , but just could n’t show the same finishing touch as @entity9			2
on the half - hour mark @entity109 got free down the left hand side and fed the ball across to his striker , unmarked on the edge of the box			0
but @entity50 could only fire straight at the keeper			0
again , he was very nearly punished immediately			0
moments later @entity64 latched on to an over-hit cut - back and fired just wide with the keeper well beaten			0
@entity3 continued to create chances , and yet another glorious one fell to @entity50 , when @entity74 ’s scuffed shot fell to him five yards out			2
again , however , the @entity124 striker was denied by @entity51			0
@entity6 's @entity64 ( centre ) defends against @entity3 's @entity109 ( right ) the second period started slowly , but both @entity13 and @entity68 had good chances , the former volleying straight at the keeper when well placed , and the latter seeing a cheeky attempt to squeeze the ball in at the near post kicked away , following a strong run from the left			1
@entity9 could have added a second in the 68th minute , but after being played in down the left hand channel by @entity15 , the @entity6 captain curled his shot just wide			1
it did n’t matter though , because just four minutes later @entity141 showed quick feet down on the right wing , beating his man and sending in an inviting cross for @entity67 to head home			0
@entity13 forced @entity146 into a good save in stoppage time , as @entity6 saw out the remainder in relative comfort .			0
