scientists have developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory			1
while the ‘ egg ’ itself was artificial , the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop			1
the method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way , rather than performing tests on laboratory animals			1
they grew a real avian embryo for 17 days - three days before it hatched			1
the shell was made of a silicon - based organic polymer			1
it is the first time such an egg has been grown in a laboratory the embryo featured in the video did n't hatch to grow into an adult bird , but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work			1
the method could be a breakthrough in ‘ lab - on - a - chip ’ technologies , which can simulate a variety of organs such as the heart , kidneys or skin			2
improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near ' 100 per cent efficiency ' in trials using mice , a leading scientist warned last month			0
dr @entity52 , a geneticist at the @entity55 , said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children			0
the warning followed a breakthrough in april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living , adult mice using the @entity67 gene editing technique			0
unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity67 system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			0
dr @entity74 told the @entity75 that it may soon find its way into fertility treatments			0
' there are heritable diseases coded by mutations in dna and some people could say , " i do n't want my children to have these mutations , ' " he said			0
he said it is up to society , and not just scientists , to look at the implications and decide whether the technology is worth the risk			0
the goal is to use stem cells to make miniature replicas of organs and see how they react to drugs and treatments			0
a benefit of doing this is that , rather performing tests on laboratory animals , the tests can be carried out on specific organs			0
@entity104 , though , are particularly hard to replicate			0
this is the first time a so - called ‘ egg - on - a - chip ’ has been created in the laboratory			1
the two scientists , from the @entity109 , part of the @entity111 , at @entity112 in @entity20 , published their research in the journal @entity115			2
the artificial shell matches the shape and curvature of a real eggshell , and uses a transparent layer of polydimethylsiloxane ( @entity122 ) - a silicon - based organic polymer			1
it is also soft , to mimic the texture of a real shell			2
in experiments , carried out over the course of about two years , the scientists constructed a series of the artificial eggshells			0
they then cultivated avian embryos for up to 17.5 days - slightly less time than the 20 days required for it to hatch , according to @entity134			1
in a video the embryo is seen moving around inside the egg , and provides an easier method of observing the evolution of an embryo over time			2
the method could allow embryos to be altered to observe changes in how birds grow ( stock image of an egg hatching sown )			1
and there are hopes the method could be replicated for human embryos previously , scientists had to rely on a method known as ‘ windowing ’ to get a peek into the processes going on inside an egg			1
this essentially involved removing part of the shell and replacing it with a transparent material			0
in their paper the researchers say the new method ‘ promises a future strategy for “ lab - on - an - egg ” technology which may be important in a wide variety of either fundamental or practical areas			2
’ practical applications are likely to include the injection of blood or any body fluidic specimens into this " egg - on - a - chip " for early diagnosis			2
this is because an egg has the potential to function as an amplification system			0
and there are also hopes that the method may be a precursor to similar laboratory experiments for human embryos			2
here the process of removing the embryo from an egg and placing it in the artificial shell is shown inside the shell , the embryo was allowed to grow for up to 17.5 days - three days before it hatched			1

scientists in @entity20 have created a see - through eggshell
they grew a real avian embryo for 17 days - three days before it hatched
the shell was made of a silicon - based organic polymer
it is the first time such an egg has been grown in a laboratory
the method could allow embryos to be altered to observe changes
and there are hopes the method could be *recreated* for humans
