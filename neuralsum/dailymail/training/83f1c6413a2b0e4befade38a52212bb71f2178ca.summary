the tennis star 's lovechild was conceived during a scandalous , short - lived and much disputed encounter at the @entity12 outpost of celebrity haunt @entity14 in 1999			1
her mother @entity5 initially claimed the liaison took place in a store cupboard but @entity5 later confessed they had made love on a staircase between two bathrooms			1
they look so alike it 's uncanny			2
although we guarantee @entity3 looks better in a sequin mini dress than her dad			1
this may have been her catwalk debut but the 14 - year - old looked at home as she strutted her stuff for @entity42 label @entity24			1
and she 's giving us style inspiration for our next big night out too			2

it 's a small beginning of something that i want to try			0

' asked if 14 was a little early to start work , she said : ' my mother is , naturally , always with me and i want it that way			0
that 's what i 'm doing here , an excursion into a new world , which i really love			0
i really never expected to cause such a frenzy			0
' while 14 - year - old @entity3 looked stunning in a silver dress , the giant poodle was not explained @entity3 paused to ' pet ' the poodle at the end of the runway before allowing it to walk on ahead of her in another interview with @entity42 glossy magazine gala , @entity3 insisted : ' i am not a child any more and i believe modelling is the key to bringing me further along in life , perhaps even as a full - time career			1
i think people probably have other things to interest them other than my name - i 'm seeking to simply be myself			0

it cost my marriage , it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having @entity3 is not a mistake any more			1

i love her very much			0
' despite the publicity and scandal surrounding her conception , @entity3 has managed to remain largely out of the spotlight during her childhood			2
