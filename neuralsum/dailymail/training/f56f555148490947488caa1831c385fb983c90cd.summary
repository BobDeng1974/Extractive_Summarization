by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 3 may 2013 the @entity2 fertiliser plant which exploded two weeks ago killing 14 people had previously been repeatedly targeted by thieves who tampered with tanks causing the release of toxic chemicals , it has emerged			2
police responded to at least 11 reports of burglaries and five separate ammonia leaks at @entity12 over the past 12 years , according to 911 dispatch logs and criminal offense reports			1
some of the leaks , including one reported in october 2012 , were linked to theft or interference with tank valves			2
the discovery has led to questions over whether thieves could be responsible for the explosion			2
ongoing investigation : it has emerged that @entity12 , pictured after the explosion , had previously been targeted by thieves @entity26 : thieves previously stole anhydrous ammonia - used to cook methamphetamine - causing leaks at the @entity12 plant according to one 2002 crime report , a plant manager told police that intruders were stealing four to five gallons of anhydrous ammonia every three days			1
the liquid gas can be used to cook methamphetamine , the highly addictive drug			1
in rural areas across the @entity41 , the thriving meth trade has turned storage facilities like @entity12 and even unattended tanks in farm fields into frequent targets of theft , according to several government and fertiliser industry reports issued over the past 13 years			1
the cause of the blast at the plant in the town of @entity12 which injured 200 people on april 17 is still being investigated but officers have so far found no evidence to suggest that security breaches contributed to the incident			2
anhydrous ammonia has also been ruled out as a cause for the blast because the four storage tanks remained intact after the blast , said @entity61 , a spokeswoman for the @entity62			1
meanwhile , investigators are pursuing about 100 leads , including a call to an arson hotline and a tip that there had been a fire on the property earlier on the day of the explosion , according to @entity72			0
authorities have not said whether either tip was credible			0
about 80 investigators from various state and federal agencies are contributing to the probe			0
they hope to determine by may 10 what caused the explosion , @entity2 fire marshal @entity79 said at a state legislative hearing on wednesday			0
security breaches : the thefts of anhydrous ammonia from the plant in @entity12 , @entity2 , caused five separate leaks of the toxic chemical tragedy : the explosion at the plant in the town of @entity12 , @entity2 , killed 14 people and injured around 200 a spokesman for the @entity41 @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , one of several state and federal agencies that monitor security at chemical plants , declined to answer questions about the breaches of security at @entity105 investigators also declined to comment			1
but thefts of anhydrous ammonia are common in @entity108 , where burglars siphon fertiliser from trailer tanks into five - gallon propane containers , said @entity108 chief deputy sheriff @entity113			1
after reviewing crime reports from the past 12 years and speaking to deputies who responded to some of the break - ins , @entity113 said security was clearly lax at the plant			1
the perimeter was not fenced , and the facility had no burglar alarms or security guards , he said			0
he added : ' it was a hometown - like situation			2
' chemical safety experts said the recurrent security breaches at @entity12 are troubling because they suggest vulnerability to theft , leaks , fires or explosions			2
apart from anhydrous ammonia , the company stored tons of ammonium nitrate , a fertiliser that can be used in bomb - making , but no thefts of that substance were reported to police			1
' regardless of what triggered this specific event , the fact that there were lots of burglaries and that they were after ammonia clearly shows this plant was vulnerable to unwanted intruders or even a terrorist attack , ' said @entity153 , a chemical process safety expert at @entity155 , who has advised @entity157 and others on chemical security			2
at the scene : investigators have found no evidence to suggest that a security breach contributed to the incident ruins : investigators are currently looking into 100 leads but still do not know what caused the blast owners of @entity12 , responding through a representative , declined to answer questions about specific instances of theft or the level of security at the plant			2
the company has encouraged its employees to share ' all they know ' with investigators , said @entity181 , a spokesman for the company			0
in a 2006 permit application with the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , the company reported it would protect ammonia tanks against theft or tampering and conduct daily equipment inspections			0
a @entity185 spokesman would not comment about security measures			0
he said the agency 's responsibility is to regulate emissions from the plant , not to oversee security			0
documents from the @entity198 show the @entity12 plant was storing 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 2012			1
ammonium nitrate was among the ingredients in the bomb used by @entity205 to blow up the @entity207 federal building in 1995 , killing 168 people			0
after that bombing , @entity209 passed a law requiring facilities that store large amounts of the chemical to report to the @entity95 and work with the agency to ensure proper security measures are in place to keep it out of criminal hands and protect against such attacks			0
@entity12 did not report to @entity95 , despite storing hundreds of times more ammonium nitrate than the amount that would require it do so			2
depending on the grade of the chemical , companies are required to report if they store at least 400 pounds or 2,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate			0
a 2005 @entity41 @entity228 ( @entity228 ) study identified hundreds of cases in 16 states where anhydrous ammonia was stolen for use in meth production			1
some illegal labs mix anhydrous ammonia with ephedrine or pseudoephedrine and sodium or lithium to make methamphetamine , the @entity41 @entity234 reported in 2001			1
devastation : the owners of @entity12 declined to comment on the previous thefts from the plant which destroyed several nearby buildings when it exploded there were at least 11 robberies at the @entity2 plant over the last 12 years with the most recent incident reported in october 2012 in dozens of instances , the @entity228 said , the thefts by meth makers siphoning ammonia from tanks caused injuries or forced evacuations because gas was released into the environment			1
however , cases of ammonia theft have become less frequent since 2006 , when new laws restricted the sale of pseudoephedrine , which is found in some common cold drug remedies , according to @entity267 , an industry association			0
police records show @entity12 began complaining of repeated thefts from the facility in june 2001 , when burglars stole 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from storage tanks three nights in a row			1
nearly a year later , a plant manager told police that thieves were siphoning four - to - five gallons of the liquefied fertiliser every three days			1
company owners downplayed security risks in documents submitted to the @entity185 in 2006 , saying thefts had dropped to zero over the preceding 20 months as meth makers now had found a substitute for anhydrous ammonia available at garden nurseries or major retailers			1
yet burglars and trespassers continued to target the facility			0
following a series of break - ins in late 2008 and early 2009 , including one where a trespasser visited pornographic websites on a secretary 's computer , police told plant manager @entity299 - who has worked at the company for decades - to install a surveillance system			1
later documents show the company complied			0
@entity299 did not respond to phone calls seeking comment for this story			0
the last record of tampering was in october 2012 , when a 911 caller reported an odor ' so strong it can burn your eyes '			0
the firm dispatched @entity314 , an employee often sent after hours to shut leaking valves and look into break - ins			1
that night , he shut off the valve but reported it had been tampered with			0
two weeks ago , @entity314 , 50 , was among those killed in the blast while responding to the fire .			0

police called to 11 burglaries at @entity12 over the past 12 years
thieves stole gallons of anhydrous ammonia used to cook methamphetamine
officers also attended five separate ammonia leaks after break - ins
