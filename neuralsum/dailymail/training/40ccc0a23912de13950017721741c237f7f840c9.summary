by @entity0 @entity1 watched @entity2 on wednesday night as they consider an offer for the @entity5 left - back			1
@entity1 's technical director @entity6 was in attendance at the @entity8 for the 0 - 0 draw with @entity10 in the knowledge that @entity12 international @entity2 is out of contract in the summer			1
he has interest from @entity16 and @entity17 , however , the @entity14 are rebuilding their squad and also see the 32 - year - old as a good free signing			2
eye on the ball : @entity2 in action for @entity5 against @entity10 @entity2 has the same agent as @entity5 winger @entity24 , who @entity1 tried to sign in january , and they have been alerted to the fact the defender is considering a fresh challenge			1
@entity1 have already made a proposal to @entity2 's teammate @entity29 as they look to take the @entity5 captain on a two year contract with the option for a third year at the end of the season and the combative @entity35 is believed to be close to an agreement			1
@entity1 have @entity24 as a possibility in mind for the summer still but remain keen on @entity40 's @entity39 too if @entity41 will countenance a sale or loan			1
@entity5 are continuing to evaluate new left - backs of their own			1
@entity46 's @entity45 and @entity48 's @entity47 remain targets			2
@entity5 were rebuffed in enquiries for both last month although talks will be resumed in the summer			1

the @entity59 title contenders have agreed a deal for 20 - year - old @entity62 @entity61 from @entity63 but also want a player with more experience			2
@entity56 has failed to establish himself at @entity66 and his departure was discussed as part of negotiations over the proposed deal for @entity72 's @entity71 and @entity73 last month			1
@entity71 has since agreed a new contract at @entity72 but is one of @entity55 's options as they re-evaluate players for that position with @entity79 of @entity17 and @entity46 's @entity80 among the names being studied			1
what 's going on ? @entity56 's future is under threat at @entity55 next in : city are close to sealing a deal for @entity72 midfielder @entity71 on the radar : @entity80 ( left ) and @entity79 are being monitored by @entity55 @entity56 , 27 , joined @entity55 in 2012 from @entity88 for £ 15.8m and scored on his debut against @entity90 but he has struggled to progress since alongside more illustrious performers			1
@entity93 wanted to take him on loan last month and may come back into the market depending on @entity55 's asking price with @entity56 still having three years left on contract			1
@entity72 midfielder @entity71 's agent , @entity98 , told @entity100 radio yesterday that his client will move to the @entity59			0
although @entity55 are considered favourites for his signature , @entity102 and @entity103 have shown an interest in the 26 - year - old , with @entity102 having gone to the lengths of securing a work permit for him ahead of a failed bid last summer			2
@entity5 were also offered @entity71 but had reservations about his level			1
@entity12 international @entity79 had agreed a new contract in principle with @entity17 but is understood to be holding off signing it as @entity55 and @entity10 show interest			1
@entity80 was considered by @entity55 last year while at @entity118 and his statistics make good reading at @entity46 this season			0
they have conceded only 11 goals while he has been on the pitch and , since his return from injury , they have kept two clean sheets			0
@entity61 , meanwhile , will join @entity55 in the summer after confirmation from @entity63 president @entity128			0
talking to @entity62 newspaper @entity129 , @entity128 said : ' we wanted to keep the side and reinforce it , but we have several highly coveted gems from the outside , such as @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity61 - who has already signed an agreement to leave in june to join @entity55			0
' @entity138 have agreed a £ 3million deal with @entity140 for midfield prospect @entity141			1

' @entity138 will give a trial to 14 - year - old @entity159 prospect @entity157 later this month			1
@entity157 from @entity160 is a quick , wide midfielder with an eye for goal who impressed @entity138 scouts during a tournament at his hometown club last summer			1
he has been invited to train for a week with @entity138 's @entity168 side from february 24			1
@entity157 said : ' it feels great and i 'm looking forward to going there and training			0
it will be a good experience			0
' @entity48 striker @entity174 is @entity176 's no 1 striker target for the summer			1
@entity138 will look at various ways to bring in the 25 - year - old who has scored 24 goals in 26 games this season			2
@entity48 would want the £ 32million buy - out clause figure as they need to bring in as much cash as possible to appease fans in any such sale			0
eye catching : @entity174 has emerged as one of the most fearsome strikers @entity48 may ask for @entity188 while @entity189 could also be offered in negotiations			2
@entity138 have considered @entity191 but @entity5 are favourites at this stage for his signature so long as they improve their form and finish the season with a flourish			1
on the move ? @entity199 @entity199 is a target for affluent clubs in @entity202 as they scour @entity204 for big name strikers ahead of their transfer window closing on february 28			0
@entity207 can ill afford to lose another player given their current results but @entity199 has struggled to rediscover his old form			0
@entity202 though has proved an unhappy hunting ground for the likes of @entity215 and @entity216 , the likelihood is @entity199 and @entity217 will wait until the summer			0

@entity235 , likened to @entity243 midfielder @entity242 , was part of @entity246 's @entity245 winning team			0
the 16 - year - old will be accompanied by his father , one of his agents @entity251 and @entity252 who is part of the @entity254			0
@entity243 may retain an interest in @entity138 's @entity256 but @entity257 remains keen on the @entity258 and will have the greater financial muscle at his disposal			1

@entity278 - bound ? @entity256 is a target for all - conquering @entity261 the remaining 75 per cent belongs to the club and its members			1
