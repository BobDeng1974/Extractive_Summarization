by @entity0 last updated at 11:17 am on 6th september 2011 a father is launching a landmark legal battle against @entity3 after suggestive photographs of his 12 - year - old daughter allegedly appeared on the website			1
in the ground - breaking writ , he claims that ‘ photographic images and literary content ’ on the site have put his daughter in danger of being targeted by paedophiles			1
if his claim is successful , the company – which is valued at £ 17.5billion – could face a massive compensation payout			2
@entity3 requires users to be over 13 - but relies on children to be truthful about their age			1
picture posed by model @entity3 , which has more than 750million users across the world , requires its members to be over 13 , but relies on children to be truthful about their age and does n’t ask for verification			1
last night the girl ’s father , who can not be named in order to protect his daughter ’s identity , revealed his fears that she may be enticed to run away by sex abusers who use the social networking site			2
he told how one picture of the girl lifting her top had been removed , but said another showing her wearing a low - cut top and make - up is still visible			2
in the writ , filed last night , he warns he will seek an injunction ordering @entity3 to close down her account and to take steps to ensure she is n’t able to open another account			1
if that does n’t happen , he will seek an injunction to stop @entity3 operating in @entity51			1
the writ says the site is ‘ guilty of negligence ’ and has created ‘ a risk of sexual and physical harm ’ to the vulnerable child			0
it also claims she has received text messages of an inappropriate nature from adult men who were asking her to post sexual messages and photographs of herself on @entity3			1
the child from @entity68 , who can not be named for legal reasons , is in care and suffers from behavioural problems			0
she allegedly posted the photographs and sexually explicit material on the site herself , giving personal details of her life , including the area where she lives and the school she attends			0
action : the father warns he will seek an injunction ordering @entity3 to close down her account and to take steps to ensure she is n't able to open another account her father said : ‘ i ’m taking this case against @entity3 as a last resort			1
i was horrified when i saw the photographs my daughter had posted of herself on the site			0
‘ she is far too young to understand what she is doing			0
she suffers problems and engages in self - destructive behaviour			0
she is currently receiving counselling			0
’ the girl ’s father claimed her current profile picture on @entity3 was sexually suggestive , adding : ‘ she is wearing make - up and a low - cut top			1
it ’s completely inappropriate to show such a picture of a 12 - year - old			0
‘ i am worried sick even thinking about the danger she could be in			2
there was another picture on @entity3 of my daughter lifting up her top but thankfully that has been removed			1
’ the man also revealed his daughter had a history of running away			0
‘ she has done so several times , ’ he explained			0
‘ once she was found in a derelict house			0
my grave concern is that she would go off with someone she met on @entity3			1
’ the father ’s solicitor , @entity119 , has set up @entity121 , a website for parents who believe their youngsters may be at risk on the social network			2
she said : ‘ i believe @entity3 is n’t suitable for under - 18s but the company is n’t even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under - 13s out			1
if a child goes into an off - licence to buy alcohol or a shop to buy cigarettes , they ’re asked for @entity136 to prove their age			0
‘ yet a child can join @entity3 – and be exposed to a bigger population than that of the entire @entity143 – without any @entity136 being requested			1
an age check , like asking for a passport number , would be a simple measure to implement			0
’ the writs lodged in @entity146 are against @entity147 and @entity3 headquarters in @entity149			2
a writ has also been lodged against the health and social care trust in whose care the girl is residing			0
it alleges that the trust has been negligent for failing to prevent the child accessing @entity3 .			2

father claims the photos mean she is in danger of being targeted by paedophiles
he wants @entity3 to close her account and make sure she ca n't open another
