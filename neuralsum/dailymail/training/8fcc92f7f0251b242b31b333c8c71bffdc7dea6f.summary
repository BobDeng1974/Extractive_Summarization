by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 says fearless @entity2 can go on being @entity4 world - beaters after victory against @entity6 put them in the last eight			2
the hero of the penalty shoot - out said : ' we left our fear at home - that is why we came through a group that had three former @entity4 winners in it			0
we are not afraid of anyone			0
' @entity18 is now the @entity4 ’s most wanted keeper with tiny @entity21 club @entity20 unable to keep hold of their star stopper whose contract runs out in one year and buy - out clause stands at just £ 6.5million			1
and having conceded just once in the group matches , against @entity42 , he made the save of the tournament against @entity6 in @entity44 to keep out @entity37 's penalty			2
@entity30 are interested in @entity18 replacing @entity46 , who has gone back to @entity47 after three seasons on loan			2
but @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity50 are all monitoring the 27 - year - old 's situation			2
he finished last season as @entity55 ’s second - best goalkeeper based on goals conceded , and the best based on the number of saves made			1
it was @entity46 who conceded fewest goals , but he had the best defence in @entity21 in front of him			1
at @entity20 , @entity1 had no such protection as was clear on the opening day of the season when he let in seven at the @entity67			1
' i have had a tough journey to get where i am but i ’ve fought hard and now i ’m reaping the rewards , ' @entity1 said , recalling how @entity21 club @entity71 plucked him from @entity2 ’s biggest side @entity73 in 2010			1

he arrived with the reputation for being a spectacular shot - stopper but @entity92 believed he could become even quicker in his area			0
he is now four or five kilos lighter than when he arrived and @entity92 says : ' hours of training drills based on speeding - up his ability to accelerate , brake and change direction quickly in his area have paid off			0
' asked by @entity101 if @entity2 have agreed a bonus for actually winning the @entity18 said : ' of course we have			0
we are just like any other team in the competition			0
we maybe have fewer options but we have a set of targets with economic rewards			0
