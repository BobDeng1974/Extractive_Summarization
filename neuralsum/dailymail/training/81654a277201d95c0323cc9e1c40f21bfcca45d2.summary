by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 26 october 2012 surrounded by explosions and flames , a man can be seen calmly sitting with his drink casually surveying the scene			1
but this is n't the latest @entity8 film - it 's is a video of how one man dealt with fireworks being hurled into his local pub in @entity14			1
but while everyone else - sensibly - ran for cover , the customer coolly acts as if nothing is wrong whatsoever			1
at one point the regular even brushes a spark out of his hair before putting his hand on his hip and then picking up his bar stool as he gets up to as if to leave , then calmly watches the flames and fireworks fly around the room			1
the regular stops to pick up his bar stool - but does not look like he 's in any rush to leave the pub the regular nonchalantly stands with his hand on his hip as he surveys the damage , after yobs threw a firework inside it as plumes of smoke filled the room , licensee @entity57 said she feared for her 13 - year - old son , @entity62 , who was sleeping in his room above the pub. amid the panic she and partner @entity65 , both 36 , managed to phone the police and fire brigade , who arrived within minutes to clear the front room of the pub of smoke			1
@entity57 said : ' it was absolutely petrifying			2
the fireworks were banging and popping around the room , flames were shooting everywhere			1
' the regulars did not know what was happening and smoke and fireworks filled the place			1
it ’s a miracle nobody was hurt			2
' i was so scared that the flames would take hold and spread			2
@entity65 and @entity87 , are shocked why someone threw a firework inside their pub , while their son @entity62 , 13 , was in bed at the time ' we are just so fortunate that the pub only had about four or five customers			1
it was quite late at night			2
' if it had been an hour earlier the place would have been packed because there were a lot of people in here watching the football			2
' i ’ve rung all the other pubs in the area warning them about what has happened to us			0
' @entity65 said : ' i have no idea why we have been targeted			0
it seems like it was just a random attack			0
' we do n’t think this was kids , it was definitely adults because these were fireworks of the expensive variety			1
' we were stood behind the bar when we saw the front door open slightly and then we saw a flame			0
' someone shouted something like " have it , take that " and the first firework was thrown in the door , followed by the second one			0
' they started fizzing and banging			0
one of the fireworks had 12 smaller ones that shot out from it			1
both were pretty big and must have cost quite a lot of money			0
' one was about eight inches square and the other was circular and a similar size			0
' i can only think the reason there was no fire is because the carpet is fireproof and there was nothing too flammable lying around to catch light			0
' the incident happened at 11.25pm on october 23			0
a spokesman for @entity150 said its officers were studying cctv of the incident and appealed for information from anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time			0
