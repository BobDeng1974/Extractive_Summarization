by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:02 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 02:54 est , 30 december 2013 couples who have been together for decades find it easier to pick out their partner ’s voice in a crowded room , according to a new study			2
the quirk , which is evident in partners who have spent more than 18 years together , also lets those who have been together for a long time screen out their partner ’s voice more easily if they are not interested			1
researchers at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity13 found new evidence for the ‘ cocktail party effect ’ after testing 23 couples , aged 44 to 79 , who had been married 18 years or longer			1
long - distance hearing : the ' cocktail party effect ' shows that , even above the hubbub of a crowded room , people who have been together long enough do not struggle to pick out their partner 's voice the subjects were asked to listen to three voices speaking at once			2
in some tests one of the voices was their partner ’s and in some all were strangers			0
in each case the listener was asked to focus on a particular voice and remember specific pieces of information			0
the phenomenon is named after a cocktail party as it may explain how members of a couple can pick each other out in social situations when they choose to , but can also seem completely oblivious when their attention is elsewhere			0
the study found that whenever a partner ’s voice featured , it was easier to retrieve the right information , according to @entity48			0
participants were able to ignore the other voices and focus on their partner for a better success rate			2
equally , when their partners were not speaking the key information , they found it easier to ignore them and focus on the strangers ’ voices			1
even older couples , whose hearing had declined naturally with age , remained very perceptive when it came to their husband or wife			0
long service : the effect was pronounced in couples who have spent 18 years together			1
a fledgling study of couples of less than five years did not show the same results the ability to screen out the voice of a spouse was strongest in under - 60s , as older participants found it less easy to ignore their loved ones			1
lead researcher @entity77 said that the effect may occur because long - term partners are so familiar with each other ’s voices that they find them easier to separate from the noise around them			1
if the husband or wife thinks the sound is significant , this could enable them to pick up on it , and if not it allows them to more easily discard it in favour of whatever sounds are significant at that time			0
dr @entity77 said : ‘ people were amazingly good at hearing their spouse when their spouse was the target voice , so when they choose to , people can target and report what their partner was saying			0
’ giving an example , she added : ‘ you ’re at a party and you ’re trying to listen to a stranger who ’s talking to you , a very interesting stranger - and at the same time your partner is yammering away			0
' this suggests you can ignore what your partner is saying so as to focus in on what that very interesting stranger is saying			2
’ however , it appears that for the effect to take place , the couples need to have spent a significant number of years together			1
another study , which is still in progress , that features couples who have spent fewer than five years together , has shown that newer couples are far more likely to go wrong – and even mistake the voices of complete strangers for their partner .			1

researchers from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity13 , studied the effect
it is named after the apparent ability of partners to ignore or hone in on each other *...* depending on how interested they are
tests found couples could hear their partners better in noisy surroundings
they also found them easy to ignore in order to focus on something else
but the effect only seems to occur in couples who spent years together
