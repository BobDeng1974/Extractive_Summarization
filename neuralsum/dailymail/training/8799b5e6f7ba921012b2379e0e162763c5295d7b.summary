@entity0 is sifting through an assortment of clothes			1
they are not the flamboyant kind he is accustomed to wearing , but they have been personally selected by him from @entity7 ’s club shop to wear for this photo shoot			1
‘ i like this one ... but definitely not this one			2
i would never choose to wear this one , ’ he says as he swaps a questionable navy pattern jumper for a smart navy claret cuff polo top			2
then @entity11 bursts into the room			2
the midfielder merrily hums a tune before offering a warm welcome to those waiting in the wings , watching his team - mate deliver a sequence of @entity21 poses for the cameras			1
@entity23 enforcer @entity0 was the obvious choice to model clothes from @entity7 's fashion line the @entity28 midfielder has always been proud of his individual sense of style suddenly @entity11 stops			1
‘ hey , hey ... why do you not ask me ? ’ he knows why			2
song is @entity7 ’s ultimate fashion icon			1
forget @entity35 , whose recent collaboration with @entity37 and @entity38 hit the billboards of @entity40 in the @entity41			2
song is the man to be beaten for style here in @entity45			2
just take a look at the 27 - year - old ’s @entity48 account and you ’ll find various pictures of him sporting outfits which many would deem to be outrageous			2
@entity56 cardigan , a large trilby hat and a sarong draped over white jeans complete with white shirt , white cap and large red moonboot sneakers			2
that 's just for starters			2
the @entity7 staff and players are often amazed by his ‘ brave ’ wardrobe choices when he arrives for work at the club ’s @entity71 training ground			1
not that it bothers the on - loan @entity75 man one bit			1
@entity0 's @entity48 account is awash with pictures of him dressed in some alternative outfits the 27 - year - old admits that some of his teammates tease him for being ' crazy ' when it come to clothes ‘ everyone who knows me really well knows that i love clothes and to dress well , ’ says @entity0 as he switches back into his clothing			1
it 's a lot tamer than some of his previous clobber , but the casual two - tone leather and wool hoody is nevertheless eye - catching with its mix of short and long black laced tassles			2
‘ some players were laughing at my jacket today , ' he says			2
' but it ’s me			2
i like it because it ’s short and long			2
they still say to me “ are you crazy ! ” that ’s me			2
i ’m an extravagant guy in the way i dress			2
’ song even has his own fashion label - @entity107			1
it refers to an @entity110 way of life , living with a certain freedom and independence			2
‘ this hat is my own brand , ’ says songs as he leans forward to run his fingers across the synthetic peak front of his black snapback hat which is embossed with the brand name in red			0
‘ i sell it in some shops but mainly on the internet			0
’ @entity0 has designed his own clothing label named @entity107 , which refers to an @entity110 way of life @entity75 stars past and present including @entity129 ( top @entity130 ) , @entity131 and @entity132 ( bottom @entity130 ) wear song styled baseball caps this particular cap retails at £ 45 and it is so popular it is out of stock			1
and it does n’t take long to figure out why when superstars like @entity140 and @entity141 are pictured proudly showcasing his designs			0
song expresses his love for fashion on the pitch too			1
he even rolls his shorts up to create the look of a throwback 1980s footballer			0
‘ i used to have it like that at @entity153 , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s my own style and i like to do it			0
i feel good when i do it and when i play i ’m very happy			0
’ @entity7 ’s current feelgood factor is a bit of a throwback to the famous boys of ’ 86 era , when @entity163 ’s side finished third in the old @entity164			1
and it ’s no coincidence that their transformation this season has been heralded by @entity0 ’s arrival			1
@entity7 have risen to a surprising fifth in the @entity172 table since @entity0 's arrival at @entity174 @entity7 fans have pleaded with co-owner @entity176 to make @entity0 's loan deal permanent in seven @entity172 games with the former @entity153 ace at the heartbeat of the @entity7 midfield , @entity179 ’s side have won four , drawn two and lost one , unexpectedly elevating them to fifth place			1
red - hot strikers @entity186 and @entity188 have deservedly taken a most of the acclaim , having hit the back of the net nine times between them			0
but @entity0 has enthralled his admirers with a succession of indomitable displays in midfield			1
in the 2 - 1 win over @entity199 a fortnight ago , he outclassed @entity200			0
he even had the audacity to pull off a rabona against the champions			0
‘ it comes naturally , ’ he laughs			0
‘ i ’m looking to try it to make people happy but i ’m mainly looking to try it to create a good opportunity			0
’ inevitably , @entity0 ’s impressive start to the season has raised questions over his future			1
co-chairman @entity213 has been inundated with @entity215 messages from supporters , urging him to make the transfer permanent			0
he agrees and insists discussions will take place			0
song admits returning to the @entity172 is different from sharing training with the likes of @entity141 ( @entity223 ) the tough tackling midfielder learned his trade under @entity226 at @entity153 naturally , @entity0 takes it all in his stride and goes about his business as usual			1
like his dress sense , things are a lot different at @entity7 to what he has been used to over the past two years with @entity233 in @entity234			1
but he is very happy			0
‘ it ’s a different way to when i was playing at @entity153 and @entity75 , ’ he admits ‘ i ’ve had a great opportunity to play for those two big clubs and again here at @entity7			1
‘ but i know it ’s a different way			0
the first time i spoke to the @entity241 [ @entity179 ] when i was about to sign , i was telling him that i like to play football			1
for me if i come from one team and the people do n’t play football			1
‘ @entity179 said , “ do n’t worry you ’ll come here and see how we are playing ”			1
i ’m very happy because he gives us the opportunity to play			0
‘ i know we are not like @entity75 but we can play			1
and i like to play – when i have the ball , i do n’t want to just put the ball away			0
i prefer to keep it , take my time and give the right ball in the right moment			0
and that ’s what i want to do to help the team			0
’ @entity179 , who picked up october 's @entity260 , convinced @entity0 to come to east @entity261 song has challenged @entity7 to aim for a @entity264 finish after their storming start this season @entity0 is not one to take all of the credit , however			1
he identifies the likes of @entity186 , @entity268 and @entity269 for their part in @entity7 ’s upturn			1
full interview in the official match programme ‘ @entity7 do have very good players , ’ he says			1
‘ the difference at @entity75 is that they are the best players in the world and , of course , that makes a big difference			1
‘ i try to bring my experience and the things i learned at @entity75 and at @entity153 to try and help the team			1
“ we are trying to play the best football we can play and make the fans very happy			1
’ and they are very happy right now			0
the boo boys have disappeared and some are even daring to dream of @entity291 football			2
‘ why not ? ’ song smiles			0
‘ for me , i believe we can catch @entity264 this year , ’ he adds , still content after last weekend ’s two - goal turnaround at @entity294 where @entity7 snatched a point			1
‘ but the best thing for us to do is to take it game - by - game			0
today , we play @entity299 at home and we have to make sure we do not lose it			0
‘ we ca n’t look at where @entity299 are at the moment			0
we know that @entity299 is a good team and they will come here to try and get a good result			0
‘ we ca n’t think because we won against @entity199 and @entity305 that @entity299 will be easy			0
no. they have good players and we have respect for them			0
‘ we ’ll do everything we can to win that game because it ’s very important to get the three points at home			0
’ song insists he will get better and better for @entity7 this season once he regains full fitness as @entity0 straightens up his cap to conclude our chat , he warns that @entity7 fans have n't seen the best of him yet			1
' at the moment , i ’m not fit like i want to be , ’ he confesses			0
‘ i have a little bit of a problem with my knee			0
i ca n't train like i want to			0
hopefully soon that will be finished			0
and when i ’m not starting to feel nothing you will see more from me			0
' i know i can do more			0
’ to paraphrase a slogan on one of his t - shirts , @entity0 may not feel he is perfect but he is a limited edition			1
this interview also appears in the @entity334 matchday programme			0
and you can see all of @entity0 ’s favourites and a behind - the - scenes video at @entity338			1
