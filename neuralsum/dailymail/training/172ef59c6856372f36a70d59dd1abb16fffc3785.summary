by @entity0 shocking footage has emerged of a teenage girl being viciously beaten in a @entity4 restaurant while staff looked on and did nothing			1
the 17 - year - old was targeted by two other girls at the fast food outlet in @entity10 , @entity11 earlier this month , with the incident filmed on a bystander 's mobile phone			1
it shows the girl being floored after one of the girl 's takes a swing at her , before she has punches rained down on top of her			2
the two girls then stop their attack before the teenage victim is eventually helped to her feet			0
a bystander , who appears to be wearing a staff uniform can be seen in the background but makes no attempt to break up the fight			0
the footage of the scuffle was eventually uploaded to @entity46 and was brought to the attention of local police , who are now investigating the incident			1
while the two girls brawl on the floor , staff members seem to stand by and watch and make no attempt to break them up the girl struggles to get up as she is then dragged along the floor by her hair they warn charges could come against the attackers			1
@entity10 police chief @entity60 told @entity61 : ' they say a picture 's worth a thousand words			0
if a picture 's worth a thousand , a video 's worth a @entity66 this video is very compelling in terms of the criminal charges that may be brought about			0
' the thing that probably disturbs me most is the fact that nowhere in that video , in none of the audio does someone say , " @entity77 , someone call the police			0
" after the punches stop , they then begin to take it in turns to kick at the girl while she is on the floor after the fight stops , the victim is eventually helped to her feet and police say they are now investigating ' that video is evident that there are a number of people in that situation and not one of them chose to call for help			1
' it is now up to the victim if she wants to press charges			0
if she does , it is likely they would be simple assault charges .			2
