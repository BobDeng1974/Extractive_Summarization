a much - loved one - eyed bear will replace last year 's @entity1 in a new advert for @entity3 as part of its ' @entity6 ' campaign			1
the ad tells the story of a much - loved bear called @entity10 who has been ground down by everyday life and is stuck in a routine			2
@entity10 is noticeably missing a smile as he ’s stuffed into a bag by his owner and arrives at a @entity3 resort in @entity18 where gradually his smile is restored			0
is this the real life ? ' @entity10 ' changes from a bedraggled teddy in a humdrum existence to a bear with a smile is it just fantasy ? taken everywhere by his loving owner , the bear starts to enjoy his holiday as soon they arrive set to @entity33 ’s tongue - in - cheek version of @entity35 's iconic @entity34 , the 60 second film will debut on tv during @entity39 ’s @entity38 this saturday and will also be shown in cinemas across the country from friday			1
the advert has the same ' feelgood factor ' as last @entity46 ' hugely popular @entity45 advert featuring a bear and a hare , with the full version of @entity3 's ad showing the bear in a toy 's own version of a holiday romance			1
little highs , little lows : the bear 's frenetic urban existence is a far cry from the holiday he is about to go on ' the new campaign builds on the success of the award - winning @entity1 , which introduced the premise that a @entity3 holiday has the power to transform you back to the best version of yourself , ' said @entity72 , marketing and digital director at @entity3			1
' the story of @entity76 brings that sentiment to life , powerfully introducing @entity6			0
' no escape from reality : the @entity33 cover of @entity35 's classic ballad fits the story well because i 'm easy come , easy go : the bear 's life is about to change as he 's stuffed into a bag to take away the one - eyed bear replaces last year 's successful ' @entity91 ' advert by the same creative team at @entity93 all smiles : @entity10 will go on sale before @entity46 @entity10 the bear will soon be able for purchase in @entity3 retail stores , with a percentage of the proceeds going to the @entity101 , a charity which provides short breaks in the @entity103 for children and their families who suffer from hardship			1
@entity107 , founding partner of ad agency @entity93 , which was also behind the award - winning @entity110 campaign , said : ' we think @entity76 is going to be a star			0
' one - eyed and raggedy he maybe , but he ’s out to steal your heart			0
' and if @entity33 ’s version of @entity34 does n’t put a smile on your face , nothing will			2
' a 30 second version of the advert will be broadcast throughout september and october and return to the tv screen at @entity46			0
@entity3 also hinted that follow ups to the story , in which the bear meets a fellow toy , a beautiful pink unicorn at the end of the holiday , are due to follow in the @entity131 .			0
