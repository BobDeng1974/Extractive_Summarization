the @entity0 was under growing pressure to stand down last night over her failure to put @entity3 on trial for serious child abuse offences			2
@entity7 ’s position as the country ’s top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the home secretary , police chiefs , crime tsars , prominent mps – and even one of her predecessors			1
mrs @entity7 said her job as head of the @entity19 was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones			1
but she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating @entity26 cover - ups by deciding that @entity27 peer @entity3 should not be charged – despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims dating back to the 1960s			2
birthday visit : @entity3 , right with cake , took @entity34 - who was repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court - on tour of @entity37 in 2002 , together with their mutual friend of @entity40 and @entity42 magician @entity41 ( centre , left )			2
it was the birthday of @entity27 mp @entity45 , alongside @entity3 @entity46 became the first cabinet minister to question the @entity0 ’s judgment in ruling that the 86 - year - old should not be prosecuted on the grounds that his dementia is now too advanced for him to have a fair trial			2
the home secretary told the @entity54 : ‘ i was very concerned when i heard about this decision			1
i have been very clear in everything i have said so far about the child sexual abuse issue … i expect to see justice done			2
’ former @entity0 lord @entity59 said it would have been better if @entity3 had undergone a procedure whereby a jury can decide on the facts of a case without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed , if a suspect is unfit to plead			2
there have been a number of recent court cases in which defendants with dementia have been jailed , and @entity3 himself has previously called for @entity75 war criminals to be put on trial regardless of their age or frailty			2
@entity59 added : ‘ it might have been wiser for the @entity19 to say , ‘ ‘ we ’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the @entity0			2
’ ’ ’ @entity84 , police and crime commissioner for @entity86 , said the decision not to charge @entity3 on thursday made it a ‘ dark day for our justice system ’			1
he added : ‘ a substantial number of victims of child abuse , who have carried the weight of such heinous crimes with them for the best part of two decades , have been terribly let down in the worst possible way			0
’ he said the @entity0 ’s ruling went against her previously stated commitment to seek justice for victims , no matter how old the allegations			0
@entity7 , right , said her job as head of the @entity19 was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases , not the most popular ones , @entity3 , left @entity108 , which has investigated @entity3 four times over the past 25 years , is considering an unprecedented legal challenge against the decision			1
@entity112 , the @entity27 mp who exposed the late @entity113 as a paedophile , said that the weight of criticism against mrs @entity7 meant something had ‘ clearly gone very badly wrong ’			1
writing in today ’s @entity118 , below , he said : ‘ mrs @entity7 is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it ’s hard to see how her position remains tenable			1
’ mrs @entity7 has also come under fire over other high - profile cases – and has been involved in a number of disputes over the competing rights of suspects and alleged victims in sex assault cases			1
her decision in the @entity3 case could be overturned if the complainants use the ‘ @entity135 ’ scheme introduced two years ago			0
a @entity19 employee with no prior involvement in the case would consider if her decision was the right one			0
alleged victims of @entity3 will eventually be able to share their experiences with the long - delayed public inquiry into historic child abuse to be chaired by @entity145 judge @entity144			0
however , that investigation faces further setbacks as campaigners are seeking a judicial review of her decision to exclude child abuse survivors from the inquiry panel for being insufficiently objective			0
the @entity19 ’s handling of previous investigations into @entity3 is also being reviewed by retired high court judge sir @entity156			0
last night the @entity19 said : ‘ the dpp is there to make the right legal decision			1
her role is to make these very difficult decisions , not to make popular decisions			1
’ roadblock to justice must be removed by @entity112 , mp who exposed the @entity113 scandal mp @entity112 who exposed the @entity113 scandal a few weeks ago , i met an experienced former metropolitan police officer to discuss investigations into high - profile child abusers active in the 1970s			1
‘ we ’re making progress but putting @entity173 and @entity174 behind bars is n’t going to trouble the @entity26 , ’ he remarked			0
‘ it ’ll be 50 times harder to prosecute a politician			0
they ’re able to call in a lot of favours			0
’ a year earlier , i ’d met police officers from @entity183 to discuss the case they were putting together against @entity3			1
i could tell they were determined to get a prosecution , but it was the question they put to me next that disturbed me almost as much as the allegations : ‘ do you think there will be any political interference ? ’ the fact that dedicated frontline officers investigating heinous crimes against vulnerable children should have to ask that in 21st century @entity198 is a worrying sign			0
but it ’s one we should come to expect given the continual revelations about previous failures to prosecute high - profile figures for abusing children			0
the decision by the @entity0 to use the public interest test to overrule the evidence when refusing to prosecute @entity3 is a reminder that outdated attitudes still prevail			0
they throw our whole justice system into disrepute			0
not just because the authorities continue to turn a tin ear to those who have been violated , disbelieved and treated as rubbish for decades			0
and not just because in admitting previous failures to prosecute @entity3 , @entity7 failed to apologise on behalf of the @entity19			1
it ’s appalling because it ’s the wrong decision and one she did n’t have to make			1
for the @entity0 to shut down any prospect of justice in such a case sends out the worst possible message at the worst possible time , and her reputation is unravelling fast			0
when the home secretary says she ’s ‘ very concerned ’ , the former @entity225 is critical , and @entity183 @entity227 are talking about a legal challenge , then something has clearly gone very badly wrong			1
so wrong that mrs @entity7 is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it ’s hard to see how her position remains tenable .			1

@entity7 position as the country *'s* top prosecutor looks bleak
she has faced criticism from home secretary , police chiefs and mps
mrs @entity7 said her job was to make legal decisions , not popular ones
