a packed jumbo jet experienced such extreme turbulence that nine passengers and a cabin crew member were injured , an accident report for @entity1 has revealed			1
the @entity7 - bound @entity6 ran into extreme turbulence after the pilots ' study of weather radar returns led them to alter course to avoid bad weather on their intended route			0
the radar monitoring by the pilots ' appeared to indicate a line of weather across the aircraft 's intended track ' , said the report from the @entity22 ( @entity22 )			1
the aircraft , which had 400 passengers on board , safely landed at @entity39 , but one of the passengers suffered a knee injury and the cabin crew member , who was in the crew rest area at the time , had head and neck injuries			1
at one point the turbulence was so severe that a stewardess had difficulty securing herself in her harness , the report says			2
most passengers were already seated with their seatbelts fastened and all those who suffered injury were in the rear , right side of the plane			2
the incident happened in the early hours of november 14 last year when the aircraft , which had taken off from @entity63 in @entity26 , was around 345 miles south of @entity64 's in @entity65			1
after their monitoring of the weather radar , the pilots had requested a deviation to the left , ( north ) , to avoid the weather			0
this was not approved but a deviation to the right of track was , and the crew altered course			0
the report said the wind at this stage was from astern , ' so the crew were not concerned that their new track would be downwind of the observed weather and thus possibly subject to turbulence '			0
the @entity22 said that as the aircraft flew on , ' returns on the radar reduced and disappeared altogether '			2
the flight had taken off from @entity63 in @entity26 and was heading for the @entity87 when the incident happened but turbulence then started and there were ' significant climbs and descents '			1
once it was over , the cabin crew attended to the injured passengers and crew member , assisted by medically - qualified volunteers from among the passengers			0
after the plane landed , medical staff came on board and treated the injured passengers			1
in another incident reported by the @entity22 , severe turbulence aboard a dash 8 aircraft being flown from @entity106 to @entity107 led to a stewardess being seriously injured			1
she was knocked off her feet during the flight on the morning of february 7 this year			0
she was treated by a doctor who was travelling as a passenger and later taken to hospital			0
one of the 71 passengers on board also suffered a minor injury .			0
