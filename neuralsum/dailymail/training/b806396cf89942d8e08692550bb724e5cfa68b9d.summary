by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 could win this @entity3 , but they ’ll face tougher tasks than the victory over @entity6			1
they thrashed a team whose best defender was sent off in the first half , whose best player @entity11 was n’t fully fit , and who had one of the least reliable goalkeepers i ’ve seen at this tournament			1
and of course the @entity17 did a bit of cheating to make sure they won			0
party time : @entity2 started their @entity3 campaign by thrashing @entity6 on monday easy pickings : @entity2 made light work of @entity6 but will face tougher tasks later in the tournament the main culprit was @entity26 , yet he was hailed as world class after the game because of his hat - trick			1
a penalty , then a lucky ricochet that the keeper should have saved , and finally a tap in - again from a goalkeeping error – those three goals do not come together to make a player world class			0
@entity26 is a modern day @entity38 – a good player , effective in big games , but not quite world class			1
he could change that at this tournament			0
but there are better players in this @entity2 team , as most expert eyes can see			1
@entity2 have looked excellent in spells at major tournaments , but without putting it together often enough to have an impact and win a trophy			1
and that ’s the point with @entity2			2
they ’ve gone close , but not close enough			0
they have n’t won a trophy this century and they ’ve not won a @entity3 for a whole generation – 24 years			0
they ’ve stuck with @entity58 since 2006 because it ’s been a succession of near misses in tournaments			2
so far @entity58 ’s career as @entity2 coach since he took over could be headlined : ' they ’re good , but they ’re not quite @entity67			1
' frustrations : @entity11 endured a difficult night as neither he nor his team - mates performed well flashpoint : @entity71 put his head in while @entity26 was on the ground and was shown the red card off : @entity71 's dismissal left @entity6 with a mountain to climb in their opening match against @entity2 of course it ’s better than @entity80 – but @entity17 do n’t judge themselves by @entity80 ’s low standards			1
they want excellence , they want to be champions , they ’re winners			0
in @entity80 we would be absolutely delighted with semi-finals			0
the history of @entity17 football is very different – they expect to beat the best in the world , as happened in the 1974 @entity3 final			0
you can have @entity93 in your team , and the @entity17 will find a way to defeat you , as was the case in the 1990 world cup final			0
even teams at a particular tournament that are significantly better than @entity2 are defeated – witness @entity80 ’s painful exit from @entity101			2
somehow the @entity17 found a way			0
so far though , despite having a seemingly brilliant crop of players , @entity58 has n’t found a way			2
will this tournament be the one ? if @entity2 do n’t win this @entity3 , they may well go down as the nearly men , left wondering what could have been if only they ’d had that little bit extra			1
as one @entity2 fan told us on @entity114 after the game : ' if it ’s not this time – this crew has had it			2
' let ’s see what they ’ve got because for me @entity2 are the team under most pressure in @entity124 , apart from the hosts			0
opener : @entity26 fired @entity2 ahead from the penalty spot in the early stages in @entity129 doubling up : @entity26 notched his second , and @entity2 's third , to put his side in an unassailable position hat - trick hero : @entity26 completed his treble to establish himself as the tournament 's leading scorer			1

@entity2 thrashed @entity6 but will face tougher tasks in this @entity140
@entity26 scored a hat - trick but there was a lot of luck involved
@entity11 was *n't* fully fit
@entity58 's side have come close in the past , but not close enough
this could be this generation 's last chance to win *silverware*
