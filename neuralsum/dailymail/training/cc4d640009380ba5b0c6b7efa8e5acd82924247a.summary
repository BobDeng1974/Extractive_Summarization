but it turned into a nightmare for the @entity11 family when the river burst its banks and they were stranded indoors for a week looking out at waist - deep water before eventually being rescued by boat			1
@entity11 , 44 , and his extended family – a total of eight adults , four children and a dog – had paid about £ 2,500 for a week in @entity21 in the hamlet of @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25			1
marooned : eight adults , four children and a dog all had to be rescued from this holiday home , surrounded by floodwater in the hamlet of @entity23 , near @entity24 , @entity25 , after they were stranded for a week by floods safety : two of the stranded party , @entity34 and @entity35 , look relieved as they are finally led to safety from the holiday home where they had been marooned for seven days it was the first reunion in 20 years of all the family members , one of whom is a diabetic who only had enough insulin for a week			1
ominously , within hours of their arrival on december 22 the fields surrounding the seven - bedroom , four - bathroom cottage began to fill with water			2
mr @entity11 , a technical author , said : ‘ when we arrived i had no inkling we were in a flood zone			2
we did n’t know the @entity5 had breached its banks			0
we were due to stay for a week and i thought we ’d be taking lots of walks			0
‘ there was a five - bar gate on the edge of the property and by the morning we could only see four bars			0
' we only had 20 yards of grass in the back garden to play with , the rest was just submerged			0
it was about 10ft at the deepest			0
‘ four hundred yards of land around us went down to just 100 yards and then all the fields disappeared			0
’ heading towards dry land : members of a family stranded at a holiday cottage over @entity3 are pictured being led to dry land by a team of rescuers submerged : a team of rescuers needed a boat to reach a family marooned at a luxury holiday cottage near @entity24 , @entity25 , over @entity3 mr @entity11 was with his partner @entity75 , his children @entity76 , ten , and @entity78 , two , his diabetic father @entity78 , 72 , and his partner , @entity35			1

@entity11 ’s aunt @entity87 also joined the group with the family dog @entity90 , a seven - year - old @entity92			1
the family had little option but to make the most of their time together indoors , playing board games , treasure hunts and @entity99 , where they had to guess names written on bits of paper and stuck to their foreheads			2
but on christmas eve , after two days of solid rain , they were going ‘ totally mad , ’ according to mr @entity11			2
as a result , he and his brother - in - law @entity82 decided to brave the waters in the dark , armed with torches and wellies , to try to reach a pub. after wading through the waist - deep water , they eventually made it and described their plight to locals who lent the family a boat so a couple of them at a time could leave the cottage to go for supplies while a rescue was planned			1
the family were finally taken to dry land on saturday when the @entity128 arrived with two boats			0
putting on a brave face : despite being marooned over @entity3 , the family tried to keep their spirits up by playing parlour games not a happy @entity3 : the four children , ( from left ) @entity83 , @entity86 , @entity76 and @entity78 , who were rescued from the @entity25 cottage do n't look as though they are having a merry @entity3 the family have been refunded the full cost of the stay at the cottage , which they booked through @entity143			1
