by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity3 rules : a classic guide to @entity5 , by @entity6 , is out now for £ 9.99 a lot has changed since @entity3 wrote about women 's quest to find a perfect match in 19th century @entity11			1
but one fan of the writer believes many of @entity3 's lessons on love , found in her famous tomes such as @entity17 and @entity18 , still ring true today			1
the @entity3 rules : a classic guide to @entity5 , by @entity6 , outlines timeless tips inspired by the famed author			1
in this extract , she reveals how much of the advice applicable to regency - era courting is just as relevant to the @entity26 generation ... @entity27 : be a woman , not a girl in persuasion , @entity3 shows us the womanly fortitude of @entity32 is far superior to the girlish shenanigans of @entity34			1
@entity34 's flirtation with captain @entity36 consists of little more than jumping over stiles and off steps so that he might catch her in his arms as a father does his child			0
but it does not work , either to win his heart or to keep her dignity - little wonder she ends the novel by literally having her head examined ! @entity32 , by contrast , follows her own much more noble course and , in doing so , gives a lesson to us all			2
we should put away those childish tricks and conduct ourselves as an equal to our man			0
rule two : find a man , not a @entity59 there is a particular kind of creature who looks like a man on first encounter but who is , in fact , a very different species			0
@entity3 would have called this creature a ' puppy ' or a ' coxcomb ' ; we would likely refer to him as a guy			1
but however we choose to name him , we should always take care to avoid him ! look at @entity74 's poor @entity74 , driven almost to distraction by the guy she has agreed to marry			0
mr @entity77 ends that novel in the hope that @entity80 may mature under @entity3 's guidance , but he is wrong			1
boys may grow into men , yes , but guys never do ! a new book takes the writings of @entity3 and applies them to modern - day dating the book says women should ditch girlish , childish shenanigans - and be wary of men who wo n't mature rule three : listen to what they say @entity17 begins with one of the most famous lines in @entity97 literature - ' it is a truth universally acknowledged that a young man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife			1
' the line is dripping with irony , of course			0
that a young man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife is really no more than a home truth of the sort bandied about between women like mrs @entity112			0
and yet - is the young man with the large fortune in this case in want of a wife ? indeed he is ! it seems that women like mrs @entity112 - and like your mother and mine - do know a thing or two after all ! time - tested rules are never secret , rather , they are universally acknowledged			1
' a well - fitting dress does not secure everything of importance , but it is certainly uplifting , of body and of mind ' @entity128 : dress up @entity3 's @entity97 had little of the prudery of the @entity131 age , when even the legs of the piano had to be dressed up ! but still , her characters were a very long way from our penchant for dressing down			1
and it 's not as if we enjoy a much greater comfort and freedom than @entity142 women did			0
on the contrary - by stretching to fit our every shape and size , dressing down has ruined the posture that @entity142 clothes demanded			2
which is important - for , when we straighten our spines , we think more clearly ; when we regulate our movements , we feel more in command ; and when we hold our head up high , well , we hold our head up high ! perhaps a well - fitting dress does not secure everything of importance , but it is certainly uplifting , of body and of mind			2
rule five : be @entity160 the ' quite ' in this rule is what is important , since ' quite ' can mean either ' completely ' or ' moderately			0
' @entity3 means us to be moderately independent , not completely so , and in this she issues a challenge to our modern wont to avoid dependency of any kind			1
in @entity74 , @entity74 is a warning to us all not to have too little independence , of mind and of means			0
but in that novel , @entity74 is also a warning to us all , not to have too much independence , of mind and of means			0
for complete independence of any kind precludes the real , mutual relation that @entity74 enjoys with mr @entity77			0
try not to have too little independence of mind and of means - and speak up rule six : do n't just sit there , say something ! ' sometimes , ' write the authors of the modern dating bible ' @entity187 ' , ' men just want to drive in silence without saying a word			1
maybe he 's thinking about how he 's going to propose to you one day			2
' but for the @entity3 woman , the idea of sitting demurely in the passenger seat , not just of the car but of the conversation , is , frankly , offensive ! @entity112 , for one , would never do any such thing , and sparkles throughout @entity17 with her lively and witty repartee - ' tease him , laugh at him ' is how she deals with the stand - offish mr @entity200			1
rule seven : no @entity202 @entity18 's @entity203 is a great enthusiast for ' girl - talk '			2
but ' girl - talk ' has that toxic tendency of making us more indifferent to what is real , transporting us to a realm of hyperbole in which nothing much matters - hence @entity203 's utter carelessness as to which of the @entity217 brothers she ends up getting married to			2
steer clear of ' girl - talk , ' says @entity3 , and keep your romantic analyses for the only one who merits them : your man			1
steer clear of ' girl - talk , ' says @entity3 , and keep your romantic analyses for your man rule eight : prove it @entity17 was originally to be called ' @entity226 ' because it is all about the dangers of simply going with your gut			1
@entity112 forms an early hunch in favour of mr @entity17 and against mr @entity200 and almost loses in love as a result			0
thankfully , a little timely detective work proves that she has got the whole thing upside - down			2
when it comes to love , @entity3 would have us listen to our heart , of course , but not omit to look at all the facts			1
rule nine : do n't just sit there , do something ! all the rage these days is for ' saying it ' - say it with a card ; say it with a kiss			2
but talk is cheap , and what a relationship needs is actions , not words			0
take what is one of the most romantic moments in the whole of @entity97 literature , when @entity32 , exhausted from a long walk but politely declining the offer of a carriage - ride home , is obliged by @entity36 to be assisted into the gig - ' quietly , ' ' without a word , ' but with his strong arms for support			0
is there a reader in all the world whose fibres have not thrilled ? modern women should not only admit that we are looking for something but also expect that we will find it @entity276 : have great expectations one of the very fine things about @entity279 was that it had great expectations on women 's behalf			0
when captain @entity36 is told by his friend @entity286 that @entity34 and her family have formed expectations on the basis of his behaviour towards her , he describes himself as ' hers in honour if she wished it			0
' we modern women like to pretend that we 're not looking for anything , that we have no agenda - almost as if dating a man because we have expectations of marriage and children were as despicable as visiting an invalid because we have expectations of an inheritance ! but we would do very well to learn something of the @entity142 way , and not only admit that we are looking for something , but also expect that we will find it !			1
