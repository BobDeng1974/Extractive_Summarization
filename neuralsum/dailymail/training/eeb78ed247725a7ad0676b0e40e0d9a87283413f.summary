by @entity0 @entity1 is no stranger to being on the receiving end of some high profile scorn , but she recently revealed that learning @entity4 blamed her for the affair proved to be the most unbearable insult of all			1
@entity1 cited recently released papers from a longtime @entity4 friend in which the former first lady called the once @entity13 intern a ' narcissistic loony toon			1
' ' i find her impulse to blame the woman ... troubling , ' @entity1 wrote in @entity19			2
troubling the 40 - year - old even further is the ever - present possibility @entity4 will again run for president , a possibility @entity1 admits she fears could drive her back into tormented seclusion			1
blaming the woman : @entity1 does n't like that recently revealed documents show that @entity4 called her a ' loony toon ' during the @entity30 sex scandal putting on a smile : @entity1 , seen here at a may 22 @entity33 gala , has had few reasons to be happy in the decade since she last ducked out of the public spotlight before she questions @entity4 's feminism , @entity1 first empathizes with the former first lady			1
' given my experiences with @entity40 , i know better than anyone what it ’s like to have a conversation with a girlfriend exposed and scrutinized , taken out of context , ' she writes			0
@entity30 's ' loony toon ' remark was one of many recently revealed comments she made on the subject to her own confidante @entity53			1
however , @entity1 says the parallel is anything but precise			2
' i realize that @entity4 was — unlike me when @entity56 was prying loose my innermost secrets and insecurities and recording them surreptitiously — fully aware of this documentation , ' she ’s the one who , according to the memos , asked @entity61 to keep a record or diary of their discussions for archival purposes			2
' no matter how humiliated the scandal left @entity4 , it was @entity1 who wound up being condemned by society , which is why she said she was infuriated to learn of @entity4 's remarks			1
' narcissist ? @entity73 ? ' wrote @entity1			0
' you might remember that just five days before the world had ever heard my name the @entity76 entrapped me in a terrifying “ sting ” in the @entity79			0
' @entity1 went on to describe her interrogation by @entity82 's threatening minions , whose demands she wear a wire tap while speaking with @entity30 confidantes she refused			2
' that , i could n’t do			0
courageous or foolish , maybe , ' she wrote			0
meanwhile , as speculation around the possibility @entity4 will make another run for the @entity13 builds , @entity1 's response to the will - she - or - wo n't - she question is : i hope not			1
' in 2008 , when @entity4 was running for president , i remained virtually reclusive , despite being inundated with press requests			0
i put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election ' recently i ’ve found myself gun - shy yet again , fearful of “ becoming an issue ” should she decide to ramp up her campaign			0
but should i put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years ? ' being a conscientious @entity100 — and aware that i could be used as a tool for the left or the right — i have remained silent for 10 years. , ' wrote @entity103			0
' so why speak now ? because it is time			0
' fearful for @entity4 : speculation that @entity4 will again run for president have @entity1 fearing she 'll again be driven into seclusion , like in 2008 and during the 1998 scandal			1

@entity1 , now 40 , says she 's troubled by @entity30 's *initial* reaction to @entity113 's affair after documents revealed she blamed both @entity115 and herself
