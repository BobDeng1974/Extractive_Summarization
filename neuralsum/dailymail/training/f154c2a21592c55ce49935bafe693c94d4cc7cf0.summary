the @entity2 government is sending thousands of military troops to the west @entity5 nation of @entity6 as part of the @entity10 administration 's ebola virus - response strategy , the @entity0 said late monday night			1
' @entity13 will set up a @entity14 headquartered in @entity15 , @entity6 , to provide regional command and control support to @entity2 military activities and facilitate coordination with @entity2 government and international relief efforts , ' a statement from the @entity0 press office said			1
' a general from @entity23 , the @entity25 component of @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , will lead this effort , which will involve an estimated 3,000 @entity2 forces			1
' @entity6 is the hardest - hit of the four west @entity5 nations that have confirmed @entity30 cases , accounting for more than one - half of the fatalities			2
the others are @entity34 , @entity35 and , to a lesser extent , @entity37			0
the @entity0 said ' many ' of them will be stationed at an ' intermediate staging base ' where they will supervise the movement of medical staff , supplies and heavy equipment			0
@entity13 already warns its own personnel that they should ' avoid nonessential travel to @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity6			1
' and the @entity64 is concerned , one @entity64 official told @entity65 , about the public perceptions aroused when @entity2 @entity68 patrol ground zero in a disease outbreak that could plunge three or more countries into chaos if it worsens significantly			1
combat soldiers and @entity73 ' will be on hand and ready for anything , ' said the official , who has knowledge of some , but not all , of the @entity30 - related planning			0
' but hopefully it will be all logistics and hospital - building			0
' ' the president has ordered us to help , and we 're eager to do it , ' he said			0
' now it looks like we 're going to be the lead dog , and that 's bound to make a lot of people nervous			1
' ' but no one wants @entity2 personnel enforcing someone else 's martial law if things go south and the entire region is at risk			1
' ' at this point in a response like this , we would normally play a support role for @entity106 and the @entity107 , ' he said , referring to the @entity106 and the @entity107			0
the official spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the @entity111 reported on sunday that the @entity2 military 's emphasis on @entity30 prevention , driven by president @entity10 , has stretched thin most if not all of its other missions			1
a senior military official told @entity111 that general @entity117 , chairman of the @entity118 , said at a recent meeting that ' the @entity64 's number one priority is combating @entity30			2
' the network 's source commented that ' we do n't need to be taking planners away from the @entity128 [ counter-terrorism ] mission , and that is what is going on			0
' defense spending is down 21 per cent since 2010 , the first fiscal year for which the @entity10 administration presided over the federal budget			2
but the president is insisting that the military carry much of the burden in @entity23			0
' national security ' : president @entity10 said during a recent @entity140 interview that @entity30 might be a threat to the @entity2 if it was not crushed out quickly , and allowed to mutate @entity141 : in @entity2 , the few known @entity30 patients -- all of them flown home from @entity23 -- have been cared for in high - tech isolation pods like this one , shown during a biocontainment drill squalor : in @entity6 , suspected @entity30 patients often end up in the care of family members in conditions where poor sanitation and minimal medical care contribute to a township - wide downward spiral in a sept. 7 interview on @entity140 's ' @entity158 , ' he called it a ' national security priority			1
' ' if we do n't make that effort now , and this spreads not just through @entity23 , but other parts of the world , there 's the prospect then that the virus mutates , it becomes more easily transmittable , and then it could be a serious danger to the @entity2 , ” said @entity10			2
@entity0 press secretary @entity169 fielded questions monday about the threat that a mutated ebola virus could endanger the @entity2 population			2
' right now , ' @entity169 said , ' the risk of an @entity30 outbreak in the @entity2 is very low			2
but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the @entity2			0
' ' and that 's why the president – among other things – that 's one of the things that 's motivating the president to direct an aggressive response			0
' @entity10 will visit the @entity107 in @entity187 on tuesday for a situation update , and to give a public speech about the need to regard @entity23 's public health crisis as a threat to the @entity2			1
@entity169 's office said monday night that military engineers would be on hand in @entity6 to build makeshift hospitals , and that the @entity2 government ' will help recruit and organize medical personnel to staff them			1
' the @entity64 has also committed to construct and staff at least one 25 - bed ' field - deployable hospital , ' in @entity6 , but the @entity201 reported last week that it will treat only infected health care workers – not civilian victims of the outbreak			1
scary : @entity6 have become accustomed to seeing hazmat - outfitted medics and burial workers in their neighborhoods , but @entity2 military troops will be an entirely different sight the ebola virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids , including blood , sweat and saliva			1
in some @entity5 cultures , preparing the dead for cremation involves physical contact with their remains -- something that has allowed the disease to spread quickly the @entity224 will send 65 administrators , clinicians and support staff to run the facility			0
that 's a change from a week ago , when @entity25 colonel @entity230 , a @entity64 spokesman , told @entity231 that the military would turn the field hospital over to the @entity6 government after it was built			1
' no @entity2 personnel right now will be providing patient care , ' col. @entity230 said on sept. 8			2
we are deploying the hospital facility , setting it up , stockpiling it			0
we 'll turn it over to the government of @entity6 and then the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) personnel will depart , " he said			2
the @entity242 says the current ebola virus disease outbreak , a form of hemorrhagic fever , has infected more than 4,900 west @entity5 and killed at least 2,400 , mostly in @entity6			0
the @entity246 purchased a shipment of 5,000 body bags for its @entity106 mission in @entity6 last month			0
@entity106 is also procuring up to 160,000 hazmat suits for medical workers			0
the @entity0 aid monday night that @entity106 will soon airlift 130,000 of those ' sets of personal protective equipment ' to health care workers in affected countries .			1

the @entity10 administration said late monday night that the @entity2 military will set up a command post in @entity15 , @entity6 , the @entity30 outbreak 's epicenter
' this effort **...** will involve an estimated 3,000 @entity2 forces , ' according to the @entity0
@entity64 official says military will ' be the lead dog , and that will make a lot of people nervous . **...** no one wants @entity2 personnel enforcing someone else 's martial law if things go south and the entire region is at risk '
@entity13 warns servicemen and women : ' avoid nonessential travel to @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity6 '
@entity64 is drawing flak for sending 25 - bed ' field - deployable hospital ' that is meant to treat health care workers , not civilian victims
the @entity2 president will travel to the @entity107 in @entity187 on tuesday for a *briefing* about his government 's efforts to stem the tide *overseas*
