from the highest peaks of the @entity2 to the afterglow of the @entity4 , this incredible sequence takes the viewer on a captivating journey through the known universe			2
in a vertigo - inducing sequence , the video zooms out from @entity11 showing the orbit of satellites , the sun and the solar system before revealing the extent of humanities first radio signals			1
moving further out , it flies the viewer on a rapid journey across @entity22 , galaxies nearby , distant galaxies , and finally quasars , which offer scientists a glimpse into the origins of the universe			1
every star , planet , and quasar seen in this sequence has been mapped to scale by the world ’s most complete four - dimensional map of the universe , the @entity47			1
‘ the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we 're essentially backing up into the past , ’ said @entity48 , director of @entity49 at the @entity50			1
