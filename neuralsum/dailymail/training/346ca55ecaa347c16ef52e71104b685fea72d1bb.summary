@entity0 has admitted going to war with @entity2 following their ignominious fall - out in @entity5 has helped push him to the edge of formula one world title glory this season			1
@entity2 's decision not to back out of an accident with @entity12 team - mate @entity0 has proved highly damaging to his own championship chances			1
although @entity0 retired that day and @entity2 went on to finish as runner - up to carve out a 29 - point cushion , the ramifications of that day have been severe for the @entity17			1
@entity0 says the ' war ' between himself and @entity12 team - mate @entity2 began in @entity5 @entity2 ( right ) crashed into @entity19 in @entity5 , forcing him to retire , and pictured here after the @entity21 @entity20 @entity0 has hinted that a music career beckons after he retires from motor racing 1 @entity0 316 pts 2 @entity2 292 pts points still on offer			1
@entity26 @entity20 ( sunday ) 1st 25pts , 2nd 18pts , 3rd 15pts @entity27 ( nov 23 ) 1st 50pts , 2nd 36pts , 3rd 30pts eventually coming clean - having initially denied his culpability over the incident - the 29 - year - old @entity2 was given a severe dressing down by motorsport boss @entity31 and non-executive chairman @entity32			2
what was described at the time as ' suitable disciplinary measures ' were taken against @entity2 , whilst he was also forced to publicly apologise to @entity0 for his actions			1
since then the tide has turned in the battle for the championship as @entity0 has won the last five races to open up a 24 - point lead over @entity2 going into the last two races , with @entity26 first on sunday			1
@entity0 laps up the adulation from @entity21 fans after making it five victories in a row the 29 - year - old raises the trophy after racing to victory at the @entity21 @entity20 in @entity50 , @entity51 after what transpired at @entity5 , @entity0 concedes at no stage did he imagine his recent run of success , although it was that incident that put fire in his belly			1
' you do n't really look five or 10 races ahead			0
i 've just always kept my head down , kept chipping away , ' said @entity0			2
' i had those four wins ( early in the season ) , and then there was the bad patch from @entity66 onwards			0
' @entity5 was like " i 'm going to turn this up			2
i 'm going to have to turn this up			0
this means war " , that kind of feeling			0
@entity0 has split with media mogul @entity73 ( r ) who includes @entity74 among his clients ' in reflecting on it , i turned the energy from that negative bomb into a positive			0
' it would be easy to believe on the back his 10th win of the year in the @entity21 @entity19 now has a clear psychological edge over @entity2			2
@entity2 certainly looked like a man who feared the writing to be on the wall post-race at the @entity87			0
@entity0 , though , is too canny to believe @entity2 will think himself a beaten man , certainly not with the controversial double points on offer in the final race in @entity92 on november 23			1
' i 'm not sure i do have an edge , ' said @entity0			0
' every weekend @entity95 resets , he comes in and qualifies on pole			0
