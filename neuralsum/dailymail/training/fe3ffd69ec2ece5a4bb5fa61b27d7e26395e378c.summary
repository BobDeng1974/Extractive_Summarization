by @entity0 published : 18:41 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 16 july 2013 a @entity2 revival has seen them move level with @entity5 for the first time in almost 18 months , while support for @entity8 has slipped back			1
a poll puts the two main parties neck and neck on 36 per cent , meaning the @entity2 are back on the share of the vote they achieved at the 2010 general election			1
the findings will cause alarm at @entity19 , given that there are only tentative signs of the economy recovering and most pollsters predict the @entity24 will reap further benefits if there is a prolonged return to growth			0
neck and neck : @entity29 and @entity31 's parties are now both on 36 per cent in the polls @entity5 have been ahead in the polls since march 2012 , when @entity33 delivered a much - criticised @entity34			1
but in recent months the @entity2 mood has been buoyed by policy announcements on an @entity38 referendum , welfare reform and immigration			0
home secretary @entity41 also saw hate preacher @entity42 , whose case thwarted successive @entity5 ministers , deported to @entity45			2
the crucial factor in the @entity2 surge , however , appears to be indications that the economy is finally turning			0
official statistics also showed @entity52 did not in fact suffer a double dip recession under the @entity24 , meaning the only slump was on @entity5 ’s watch			2
@entity56 , mp for @entity57 and a @entity2 right - winger who has often been critical of his party ’s leadership , suggested last night ’s poll would bring @entity5 leader @entity31 out in a ‘ cold sweat ’			1
the @entity64 survey for the @entity65 appears at odds with others , with one @entity69 poll at the weekend giving @entity5 an 11 point lead			1
however the @entity72 ’s poll of polls recently found a fall in the size of @entity5 ’s lead from 13 points to six in the past four months			1
@entity64 ’s poll last month showed a strong @entity5 lead of seven points			1
but last night ’s survey showed an extraordinary turnaround , with the conservatives on 36 per cent ( up seven on last month ) , @entity5 36 per cent ( no change ) , @entity85 13 per cent ( up one ) and @entity8 7 per cent ( down 5 )			1
the @entity24 appear to be benefiting from a steady erosion in support for the @entity8 , which fell from 18 per cent in may just after its success in local elections to 12 per cent in june and is now in single figures			2
@entity2 strategists have long argued that support for @entity8 is in part a protest vote exercised in relatively unimportant elections , such as those for councils and the @entity98 , which will not be replicated in a general election when voters are confronted with the choice between either a @entity2 - led or @entity5 - led government			1
however , @entity104 ’s party will hope for a resurgence of interest during the @entity98 elections next june , when it is aiming to come first in terms of national share of the vote			0
looking upwards : @entity104 's @entity8 is down five per cent on last months polls , but the leader has high hopes for next years @entity98 elections the @entity2 believe they have countered some of @entity8 ’s appeal by backing legislation paving the way for a referendum on @entity52 ’s membership of the @entity38 to take place by the end of 2017			1
both @entity5 and the @entity85 have refused to back a referendum			2
a @entity5 source said the @entity64 poll ‘ feels outside the margin ’ , adding : ‘ polls come and go but it ’s fair to point out in the last few days we have seen leads of 11 , seven , 11 , eight and eight points			2
’ @entity2 backbenchers demanding that @entity29 follows more hardline policies are engaged in ‘ fantasy politics ’ , former donor @entity132 has claimed			0
a poll commissioned by the @entity2 peer has found that policies proposed in an @entity139 are not universally popular			0
@entity2 right - wingers have proposed 42 private members ’ bills proposing everything from the banning of the burqa to the return of the death penalty			0
but the poll found that just 13 per cent of voters agree that the @entity149 should be renamed @entity150 , another key proposal			0
only one in four voters support allowing employees to opt out of the minimum wage , scrapping the @entity155 and privatising the @entity156			0
lord @entity132 said that to win in 2015 ‘ we certainly need to deliver on immigration , crime and welfare reform , but it is at least as important for the @entity24 to be a competent and united party of government that can be trusted on the economy and public services ’ .			0

tories are up seven per cent and @entity5 remains *unchanged*
