a new study has found that drivers are speeding through inactive roadwork sites , despite high crashing and fatality rates in these areas			1
dr @entity6 , a road safety researcher , surveyed more than 400 people who were asked to estimate their speed for a range of different roadwork site scenarios			2
' it 's seen as crying wolf			0
if people are asked to slow down at roadwork sites but find there is no roadwork being undertaken they become de-sensitised to the signage and ignore speed limits , ' he said			2
dr @entity6 ( above ) , a road safety researcher , surveyed more than 400 people in his study on speeding around inactive roadwork sites the study revealed the majority of drivers exceeded the speed limits at roadwork sites , despite these areas having high crash and fatality rates ' in 2013 , our research found that at three @entity37 rural roadwork sites , the majority of vehicles observed exceeded the posted speed limits by at least 5km/h , ' he said			1
' we found when a road worker and machinery were visible , drivers nominated lower speeds , suggesting that they were far more likely to slow down than if they saw no activity			0
' ' there was about a 20 per cent reduction in speed between an inactive roadwork site ( 53km/h ) compared to an active site with workers visible ( 42km/h )			0
' dr @entity6 said despite reduced speed limits , crash rates and crash severity around roadwork sites were high because drivers failed to slow sufficiently and were often not paying attention			2
' roadwork sites have high crash rates and there have been numerous fatalities at roadwork sites in @entity37 involving workers and public road users , ' he said			1
dr @entity6 said the study reinforced moves by the @entity67 to review speed limit signage around roadwork sites , but cautioned that hazards may also remain outside of work hours , requiring reduced speed limits around the clock at some sites			1
the study found that road workers on site had the biggest impact on drivers to reduce speed ' there are no simple solutions , but multiple measures used in combination may be most effective			1
with technology , for example , variable speed limit signs can be easily changed without the need for workers to physically move or replace traditional static signage , ' he said			0
' there are also feedback speed displays which record and display how fast a vehicle is travelling , which drivers respond to well			0
' our survey showed road workers on site had the biggest impact on drivers to reduce speed , while the most effective specific measure was having police visually present and potentially conducting enforcement , ' he said			1
' if we can combine the effective measures , then we are more likely to see drivers reduce their speed , which will improve safety for both drivers and workers			0
' the results of the study have been presented at the @entity113 in @entity114 , which brings together experts from all facets of transport safety including roads , rail , fleets , and mining to improve workplace safety .			0
