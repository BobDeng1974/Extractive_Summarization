@entity0 takes his @entity2 side to a revitalised @entity3 on saturday believing it is no coincidence that the @entity3 ' upturn in form has come with @entity7 finally over his early - season injury problems			1
@entity3 have won both @entity10 games @entity7 has been involved in since the 20 - year - old @entity12 talent missed the first two months of the season with a knee injury			1
@entity16 's side scored six goals in beating @entity18 and @entity19 to move into ninth spot after a sticky start to the campaign and they would leapfrog sixth - placed @entity2 by beating them at @entity23			1
@entity7 has been in fine form as @entity3 have improved on their early - season form @entity2 have never won on the blue half of @entity27 and @entity28 has identified @entity7 - who scored in both @entity3 league wins against them last season - as the main threat to his team creating club history			1
' @entity7 is a top player , a real talent , ' @entity2 manager @entity0 said			1
' he plays with no fear and he is a big factor for them			0
' they missed him when he was out			0
since he 's come back he 's done well and , if he stays fit , he will only get better			2
' he is right up there as a young @entity12 talent			0
i know he has been likened to quite a few players and ability-wise and talent-wise he is showing that week in , week out			0
' he 's only just come back from his injury so whether he is at his full best right now i do n't know , but he is right up there			2
' @entity16 will give him the freedom to express himself , but he can attack and defend and he is an all - rounder			0
' @entity2 beat @entity3 for the first time in 21 attempts in the @entity48 in september @entity2 claimed their first win in 21 attempts against @entity3 in september when @entity28 's men ran out comfortable 3 - 0 @entity48 winners at the @entity53			1
they also claimed a first win in six league games with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity57 last weekend , but @entity0 knows the size of the challenge ahead as he once more comes up against his former @entity2 manager @entity16			1
' we beat them before but that was in the cup and the league will be a different situation , ' @entity0 said , ' @entity23 is a really tough place to go but we go there with confidence after an important win against @entity57 , which was a bit of justification for the lads			1
' we are not expected to get anything from the game , but we are sixth in the league and have good momentum			0
' we can go there with freedom and put on a performance that warrants some points			0
' @entity2 were in front against @entity82 in the cup this week before they were knocked out @entity3 have had a rare free week to prepare for the game without any @entity86 distractions , while @entity2 have already been on @entity27 this week in losing 2 - 1 to @entity82 in the @entity48			2
@entity0 knows the strain that playing in the @entity88 puts on players after @entity2 's participation in the tournament last season but he believes @entity3 have now adjusted to the demands of juggling domestic and @entity86 commitments			1
' the games come thick and fast and you get out of the routine with games on thursday and sunday , ' @entity0 said			2
' we learnt it 's an adjustment last season when we were in the @entity88 , but they are a more experienced squad in @entity86			0
' they are showing they are right back to where they were last season			0
' we go there as underdogs given the form they are in , but we 're confident we can go up there and do something			0

@entity7 's return from injury has helped boost @entity3 's form
