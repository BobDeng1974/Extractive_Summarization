@entity1 mep @entity0 has defended claiming tens of thousands of pounds in allowances while barely speaking in @entity3 a @entity1 mep has admitted one of the only reasons he turns up in @entity3 is to claim £ 200,000 in allowances			1
@entity0 has not done anything in the @entity8 in the last year , and has only taken part in half of votes since 2009			1
the @entity12 insisted he could not see the point in making speeches in the @entity8 , and instead claimed the taxpayers ’ money to fund an anti-eu website			1
all @entity18 receive a salary of £ 78,000 but must ‘ clock in ’ to the @entity8 building in order to receive various allowances			1
however , mr @entity0 has only made speeches or asked questions just 19 times , well behind the average of the five other meps in the @entity28			2
asked whether allowances were a factor influencing his decision , mr @entity0 : ‘ i would n’t say getting the allowances is one of the main motivations , i ’m trying to be fair about it , it is a factor , of course it is			1
’ he was confronted about his expenses during an interview on @entity43 ’s @entity42 show			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ why make a speech when you know that it is totally ineffective ? that you are there talking to a gallery of about six people , i do n’t quite see the point of me doing that			1
‘ it ’s not that i ’m not doing anything , i am trying to get us out of this mess and that can only be achieved over here			0
’ last year a study found that cosseted @entity18 now have incomes up to 20 times higher than the people they represent			0

mr @entity0 said there was no point in giving a speech to the @entity8 which was often all but emtpy mr @entity0 admitted turning up at the @entity8 to ensure he receives his huge allowances , most of which he spends on a website aimed at removing the @entity79 from the @entity67			1
he added : ‘ the @entity8 has no power , it ca n’t make or change legislation , it has little or no power , we are in fact just a pantomime taking players to make the illusion of giving democracy where none exists			1
the @entity43 found mr @entity0 – who is standing down in may - employs five full time staff , who mainly work on the website , another woman who covers @entity3 and @entity93 , and a part time employee			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 , said : ‘ there is a massive amount that goes on in the @entity62 parliament and that ’s why most of the members are there full - time doing their jobs , ‘ i ’m sorry if @entity0 finds it so boring , but i would have to ask the question why did he stand in the first place			1
’ however @entity1 chairman @entity109 defended mr @entity0 ’s conduct			1
‘ we have a specific job to do and we are elected to do it , that is to campaign and work for @entity79 to come out of the @entity8 , ’ he said			2

it calculated that he cost taxpayers £ 156,415 per year , attended around 83 per cent of parliamentary sessions , and made just 12 speeches , questions or motions			0
the figures would seem to suggest that his activity dropped dramatically after he had spent more than a year as an mep			0

he was given the fourth - worst ranking in this category			0
