@entity14 , who relocated to @entity18 to focus her energies on an acting and writing career , admits she auditioned for the @entity6 movie twice ' in a nutshell it ’s about a girl from @entity52 , who moves to @entity18 and attempts to reinvent herself as the creator of a fashion - focused lifestyle website			1
