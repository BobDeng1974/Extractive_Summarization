[ caption ] the discovery of a complete 1.8 million - years - old skull has rewritten the story of how modern man evolved from our early ancestors in @entity7 , according to @entity9 scientists			0
a skull found in @entity11 from an ancient human ancestor , known as @entity13 , implies that all @entity15 species were once one			1
research suggests that the earliest members of the @entity15 genus , including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 belonged to the same species and simply looked different to each other , shaking up the classification system for early human ancestors			2
the 1.8 million - year - old skull : the discovery of @entity13 ( pictured ) has rewritten the story of how modern man evolved from our early ancestors in @entity7 , according to @entity9 scientists			2
the skull , which was found in @entity11 , implies that all @entity15 species were once one the skull that was unearthed in @entity31 , @entity11 and was unlike other @entity15 fossils and combines a small braincase with a long face and large teeth			1
pictured is a skull discovered in 2005 that is 1.5m years old unique : the skull were discovered alongside the remains of four other early human ancestors and a number of animal fossils it is popularly thought that different characteristics among the @entity15 fossils showed they were distinct , different species but this research casts this theory into doubt			1
scientists from the @entity52 in @entity53 say @entity13 indicates that rather than several ecologically specialised @entity15 species , a single @entity15 species that was able to cope with a variety of ecosystems , emerged from @entity7 some two million years ago			1
they studied the skull that was unearthed in @entity31 , @entity11 and found that unlike other @entity15 fossils , @entity13 combines a small braincase with a long face and large teeth			1
it was discovered alongside the remains of four other early human ancestors , a variety of animal fossils and some stone tools , all of which are associated with the same location and time period which makes the find truly unique			0
the site , which has only been partially excavated , is providing scientists with the first opportunity to compare and contrast the physical traits of multiple human ancestors that apparently coexisted at the same time in the same geological space			0
the braincase of @entity13 is only about 33.3 cubic inches ( 546 cubic centimeters ) , and suggests early humans had smaller brains despite modern human - like limb proportions and body size the @entity31 excavation site , situated below a medieval @entity11 village , where the skull was found			1
it has only been partially excavated so far but has given scientists the first chance to compare how different human ancestors lived together the differences between these @entity31 fossils are no more pronounced than those between five modern humans or five chimpanzees , the scientists claimed			2
the discovery suggests that early , diverse @entity15 fossils with their origins in @entity7 , actually represent variation among members of a single , evolving lineage - most appropriately @entity21			1
@entity104 from the @entity9 museum said : ' had the braincase and the face of @entity13 been found as separate fossils at different sites in @entity7 , they might have been attributed to different species			2
' that 's because @entity13 unites some key features , like the tiny braincase and large face , which had not been observed together in an early @entity15 fossil until now			2
' @entity117 of the @entity118 holds a 1.75 - million - year - old skull , excavated in @entity31 in 2001			0
the bones of an early human with a small head suggest larger brains associated with modern humans did not necessarily evolve before our ancestors began migrating given their diverse physical traits , the fossils associated with @entity13 at @entity31 can be compared to various @entity15 fossils , including those found in @entity7 , dating back to about 2.4 million years ago , as well as others unearthed in @entity132 and @entity133 , which are dated between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago			1
he added : ' the @entity31 finds look quite different from one another , so it 's tempting to publish them as different species			0
' yet we know that these individuals came from the same location and the same geological time , so they could , in principle , represent a single population of a single species			0
' the hominid fossils from @entity31 represent ancient human ancestors from the early @entity149 , soon after early @entity15 diverged from @entity150 and dispersed from @entity7 , according to the study , published in the journal @entity153			1
the jaw associated with @entity13 was found five years before the cranium was discovered but when the two pieces were put together , they formed the most complete large skull ever found at the @entity31 site			2
for this reason , the researchers suggest that the individual to whom @entity13 belonged was male			0
the braincase of @entity13 is only about 33.3 cubic inches or 546 cubic centimetres , however , which suggests that this early @entity15 had a small brain despite his modern human - like limb proportions and body size			1
professor @entity104 added said : ' thanks to the relatively large @entity31 sample , we see a lot of variation			0
' but the amount of variation does not exceed that found in modern populations of our own species , nor in chimps and bonobos , ' he added			0
' furthermore , since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the @entity7 fossil record ... it is sensible to assume that there was a single @entity15 species at that time in @entity7			1
' and since the @entity31 hominids are so similar to the @entity7 ones , we further assume that they both represent the same species			0
' 55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - @entity193 ( great apes ) speciate from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve			0
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - @entity201 , early ‘ proto - human ’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - @entity203 appear			0
they have brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.7 million years ago - @entity207 , live in woods , has massive jaws for chewing 1.8 million years ago - @entity210 , implies that all @entity15 species were once one 1.6 million years ago - @entity213 axes become the first major technological innovation 3 million years ago - the bipedal australopithecines evolve in the savannas of @entity7 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths			1
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - early humans make shelters 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach @entity133			0

@entity13 , which comes from an ancient human ancestor found in @entity31 , @entity11 , implies that all @entity15 species were once one
it was thought that different characteristics among the @entity15 fossils showed they were distinct , different species
scientists from the @entity52 in @entity53 say @entity13 suggests a single @entity15 species could cope with a variety of ecosystems
