@entity0 has been accused of suppressing a major report because it did not support its claim that the @entity3 is under threat from privatisation			1
the health select committee was due to publish its study of @entity3 funding before the election			1
but , according to conservative mps on the all - party committee , it had heard little evidence of fundamental changes to the @entity15 as a result of @entity18 reforms			2
the @entity11 were told that , on the contrary , the pace of privatisation had actually slowed since the election , and that there had been no extension of charges and top - ups – meaning that there was no reason to think the @entity3 would not remain free at the point of use			1
healthcare row : @entity32 mps on the health select committee have accused four @entity0 counterparts of blocking a report that suggested the ' pace of privatisation ' in the @entity3 has in fact slowed since the last election this dealt a blow to @entity0 's argument that @entity42 can not be trusted with the @entity3			1
rather than publish the report weeks before the election , the four @entity0 committee members blocked it after reading a draft , claimed their @entity32 counterparts @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
mr @entity48 , the mp for @entity49 and @entity50 , said : ' this is despicable			0
we heard hours and hours of evidence , but because it does not support the national party line about the @entity3 being under threat , they block it			2
' @entity0 were only interested if they could use it to weaponise the @entity3			2
' last night , the angry @entity59 released a dossier of some of the report 's findings			1
it said : ' the weight of evidence … showed there had not been an extension of charges , of top - ups during the current @entity71 , and that these are not planned			0
' it showed very little increase in private - sector providers since 2010 [ and ] a general trend of declining administration costs in the @entity3			0
' it added that independent provider admissions had increased by just 0.6 per cent under the @entity18 's @entity80 , while foundation trusts now receive a lower proportion of their income from private patients than during @entity0 's time in power			0
conflict : @entity32 mps @entity46 ( left ) , @entity47 and @entity48 claim their rivals blocked the report because it made the @entity32 look good , but @entity0 mp @entity91 says the report they released themselves ' did not make full use of the evidence ' the dossier also said expenditure on @entity3 administration had fallen from 5.1 per cent in 2009/10 to a planned 2.7 per cent in 2015/16			1
and it found that nothing ' suggests that continuing with a comprehensive tax - funded @entity3 is intrinsically undoable '			0
mr @entity48 said : ' they said the report was too pro-government			0
but that 's ridiculous , because many of our reports have been very critical of the government			0
' on this occasion , the evidence simply did n't support what @entity0 wanted to hear			0
' @entity91 , a @entity0 mp on the committee , told the spectator : ' this was a private meeting and i am disappointed a colleague has publicised their version of what was said			2
' the report … did not make full use of the evidence			2
at a different point in the parliamentary cycle … there would have been time to redraft the report as we have done previously			0
' a @entity0 source said : ' the @entity32 @entity11 did n't want to admit to what their government has done			1
