an incredible new map could reveal that 13th century @entity3 explorer @entity1 was actually the first @entity4 to discover @entity6 - more than two centuries before @entity7 set sail for the @entity9			1
a crude map drawn on sheepskin shows what appears to be the @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 and the west coast of @entity6			1
' @entity17 ' comes from a trove of 14 documents that have just been studied in depth for the first time			1
they were found in the 1930s in a trunk in that belonged to an @entity3 immigrant who settled in @entity26 , @entity27			1
the @entity13 @entity1 was famous for his journey to @entity38 - and for his tall tales the documents , reportedly written by @entity1 's daughter @entity41 recount how the @entity43 explorer met a @entity45 trader on the @entity46 on the far eastern edge of the @entity49 continent then sailed across the @entity13 to @entity6			1
before his voyage , the trader told @entity53 about a land far east - a 40 days voyage from @entity46 , @entity50 reports			2
it is believed that if @entity53 sailed to @entity6 , he would have crossed the @entity13 - a 51 - mile stretch of waster that connects the easternmost point of @entity49 to the westernmost point of @entity14			1
this new land , the documents say , was called ' the @entity64 ' and it was ' twice as far from @entity38 ' as @entity46 and @entity53 soon set sail in search of it			1
@entity1 arrived , according to the documents , and discovered a people who wore seal skins , ate only fish and lived in homes ' under the earth , ' according to the @entity50			1
the documents also describe a great glacier that came down into the sea			0
it appears that @entity53 then sailed around the @entity14 coast - possibly even around the @entity15 , east to @entity79 and down the @entity81 coast			1
one expert , who authored a website called @entity84 even claims that the @entity43 explorer even made it to @entity86 and @entity87			2
if the documents are authentic , they could overturn commonly held beliefs about @entity7 ' 1492 voyage from @entity92			0
' it would mean that an @entity3 got knowledge of the west coast of @entity6 or he heard about it from @entity97 or @entity38 , ' historian @entity98 , a history professor at @entity99 in @entity100 , told @entity50			1
his book , the mysteries of the @entity104 , is due out in november			0
the documents have been in the @entity106 since the 1930s and were even analyzed by @entity109 's @entity108			2
the account , while fascinating , has several holes			0
the first is that @entity1 - an infamous teller of tall tales - never specifically mentioned his travels to this new land in his world - famous account of his journey , @entity118			2
he did , however , say on his death bed , ' i did not tell half of what i saw			0
' second , the source material remains dubious			0
@entity124 , the immigrant who donated the documents to the @entity106 , says he inherited them from a wealthy family member			0
carbon dating on one of the sheepskin maps reveals it was created in the 14th or 15th century - meaning that even if it is authentic , it is a copy of the original			0
still , the @entity13 was not discovered until the mid- 18th century - three hundred years after the document was made			1
the ink on the map , however , has not been tested - meaning it could have been forged after the sheepskin was created			0
@entity137 , a controversial historian and the author of @entity84 , also studied the documents in depth and argues that the landmarks that @entity1 laid out match up with remarkable accuracy to @entity38 maps that date from before @entity1 's time - as well as maps that came after			1
@entity1 was a 13th century @entity3 merchant from @entity43			1
and while he was n't the first @entity4 trader to travel into @entity38 , his detailed account of his journey , @entity150 or @entity118 , made him the most famous			0
his tales of traveling the @entity153 through @entity154 and befriending the @entity156 emperor of @entity38 @entity157 captivated @entity4 and helped fuel the @entity159 obsession with trading with the @entity161			0
@entity7 set sail for @entity163 in 1492 after having been inspired by his writing			0
at age 17 , @entity1 set off with his father and uncle - both @entity43 merchants who grew wealthy trading with the east - on a journey to @entity38			2
they returned 24 years later with a host of treasures and incredible tales			0
the three @entity53 traveled over-land for three and a half years before reaching @entity157 in @entity38			2
the @entity157 , one of the most powerful emperors to ever rule @entity38 , had met @entity1 's brother and uncle on a previous voyage			1
they were the first @entity159 men the @entity157 had ever seen			0
in @entity38 , the @entity53 became close the the @entity157 - even carrying out missions across @entity38 and as far away as @entity181 as his emissary			2
in 1292 , the three @entity1 left @entity38 and traveled back to @entity3 - returning in 1295			1
when he arrived in @entity43 , to find the city - state at war with the @entity185			0
he took up arms and was captured in 1296 following a naval battle			0
from a @entity188 , he dictated the tail of his travels to his cellmate , who wrote them down into what later became @entity118			0
@entity1 was released in 1299 and married			2
he had two daughters and died at age 69			0
he says that distortions in how the map is drawn - for example , the @entity13 appears as a north - south passage and not an east - west passage - can be chalked up to magnetic distortions in @entity53 's compass readings that occur that close to the @entity204			1
calculating for the distortions shown on @entity53 's map , @entity137 estimates that @entity1 made it all the way around @entity14 and down to @entity79 before turning back			1
@entity137 , who described himself as a ' history detective , ' posits that @entity1 even alluded to a ' @entity210 ' beyond the plains of @entity212 , in the travels of @entity214			2
he posits that @entity1 was referring to @entity14			0
@entity137 suggests that @entity53 's exploration could have been sent on a mission by @entity157 - the @entity156 ruler of @entity38 whom @entity1 befriended			1
@entity1 was meant to explore the far reaches of the empire in order to determine the source of furs , precious stones , gold , perfumes and dyes that were being imported into the @entity227 in @entity38			0
@entity1 's ship , pictured here in this engraving , reportedly sailed across the @entity13 to the ' @entity64 '			1

the map was reportedly drawn up by @entity1 after he ' sailed across the @entity13 ' in the 1200s
comes from a trove of documents that are claimed to have been *compiled* by the @entity3 explorer 's daughter
@entity53 describes people who wore seal skins , ate only fish and lived in homes ' under the earth '
some claim he made it as far down the coast as modern day @entity249
authenticity has yet to be determined
