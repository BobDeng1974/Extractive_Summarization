by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ at the end of last year , following the @entity4 draw , @entity2 chairman @entity1 attempted to clarify his infamous cut - throat gesture			1
‘ if you can get out of the group , you ’re four games from winning it , ’ he said			1
‘ and let ’s not kid ourselves — we have a chance			1
’ in the end , after a depressing defeat against @entity15 in @entity16 on thursday , we realised we never had a chance at all			1
on friday night we received confirmation			1
not easy to get along with , but a serial winner at the highest level			1
favourite @entity37 moment ? 1986 @entity4 when @entity44 thinks he has levelled against @entity45			1
you realise then what it ’d mean to win it			1
best player in your lifetime ? @entity52			1
the one full - back to get the better of @entity53 for club and country			1
the sooner the @entity2 and everybody associated with @entity37 realise that every country in the world loves putting one over on us the better			1
when you bounce into @entity61 with your bling and boot deals , your oxygen tents and 80 staff ( including the players ) , you will attract some attention			2
thursday evening was another brutal mugging			2
when @entity33 pulls on the colours of @entity15 and belts out @entity72 , he is singing it for the 3.3million lining the streets of @entity75			2
@entity33 , who scored twice , would rather die for his country than lose to @entity37			2
ask him and he will tell you			2
there are scores of other players at this @entity4 — playing for @entity81 , @entity45 , @entity38 , @entity82 or @entity83 — who feel the same			1
national pride : @entity33 would die for his country rather than lose to @entity37 name one @entity37 player of whom you could say the same			2
go on , name one			2
when @entity35 claimed @entity33 would have to do it at a @entity4 to be bracketed in the world - class category last weekend , he simply added to his motivation			1
@entity33 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 are elite players			2
all of them have delivered here			2
these boys grow in the tunnel when they slip on the national team ’s jersey			2
many of @entity15 ’s players are street kids , antagonised by the money @entity37 ’s players earn			0
at 19 , @entity110 was the lowest - paid @entity37 player in thursday ’s starting xi. he earns £ 2.5m a year before endorsements			1
huge wage : @entity110 is the lowest paid player in the @entity37 squad at £ 2.5m per year @entity116 , who came on as a substitute , was raking in £ 55,000 a week at @entity118			1
he is likely to have received a pay rise at @entity120			0
good luck , because we would all do the same given half a chance , but big dosh is a big issue in international football			0
after @entity128 referee @entity127 blew for the final whistle in @entity16 , @entity37 ’s players could n’t swap shirts quick enough with the opposition			0
yes , it ’s an accepted ritual , but at least have the decency to let the scale of what has happened sink in before hunting for souvenirs			0
we are weary of golden caps in big , glass presentation boxes and arguing about whether @entity52 should have been at this tournament ( he should have , by the way )			0
when you crow as much as the @entity2 does about the best - laid plans — a week ’s warm - weather training in @entity145 , a flag - waving send - off at @entity147 and a week in @entity148 — you ’re asking for trouble			1
seven days into @entity37 ’s @entity4 , they are out			0
early exit : @entity152 , @entity25 and @entity153 trudge off @entity37 ’s coaching staff can put out all the white cones they like for the warm - up and it is just a tick in the box			1
it is no substitute for steel and strength			0
in @entity163 , @entity37 ’s players were put through a complicated pre-match procedure involving all manner of exercises			0
in the other half of the pitch , the @entity168 players were casually firing shots into @entity172			0
it was their way of shedding tension after weeks of preparation and it worked			0
if we are told one more time about the ‘ positives ’ of losing our opening two group games , we may as well accept we are done and dusted at the highest level			0
@entity181 , who has the best interests of the country at heart , claimed the @entity168 game was the best @entity37 performance in years			0
ca n't bear it : @entity188 watches helplessly from the sidelines as @entity37 's fate was all but sealed if playing fast and loose is the way forward , we will need to start scoring four goals a game with a defence as poorly organised as this			1
we have been told many times that this tournament was designed with the development of young players in mind			0
can you imagine the @entity81 , @entity45 or @entity38 coach trying that on ? they would be marmalised and replaced			1
when the players and @entity2 start trotting out the line that there is no expectation on this squad , it is an excuse for failure			0
@entity37 ’s players did n’t know what they were fighting for			0
was it to get out of the group ? to win the damn thing ? heroic failure ? gutted : @entity37 fans who paid thousands to see the three @entity217 were badly let down the @entity2 are so paranoid that they would n’t even confirm a minor injury to @entity152			0
apparently , confirmation could damage the team ’s chances			0
when @entity223 , a @entity4 winner and genuine great , turned his ankle in training , @entity222 released a short statement			0
little things , for sure , but one of many little things that paint a picture of disarray			0
after more than a decade covering the @entity37 team , this once - in - a - lifetime @entity4 experience is over already			1

once - in - a - lifetime party in @entity38 ca n't *inspire* three lions
huge wages and *pampering* only serve to motivate rivals
@entity1 gives @entity35 vote of *confidence* despite dismal showing
