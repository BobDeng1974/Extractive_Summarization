@entity1 ’s latest hero @entity0 found time to share a joke with @entity4 teammate @entity3 before playing down the pressure on his shoulders after inspiring the hosts into the last 16 of the @entity8 to face @entity9			1
@entity0 scored twice in a 4 - 1 win over @entity3 's @entity11 , with @entity12 and @entity13 getting the others for @entity1 , and the laughs before the game turned to a consolation hug after the final whistle			1
the 22 - year - old , who now in has 35 international goals in 52 appearances , said : ' there is no pressure			2
i ’ve always said there is no pressure when you are making a dream come true and doing something you have sought after since you were a kid			0
' i just want to help my fellow players not only by scoring goals but doing whatever it takes on the pitch to help us win			0
' we are on the right track and the whole team is getting better and getting close to our target			0
' @entity1 coach @entity48 admitted that he would have preferred to face a @entity50 team rather than @entity9			1
he said : ' if i could choose i would have picked someone else as @entity9 are a good @entity54 team , they have quality , they are organised they have the will to succeed			1
on target : @entity0 scored twice against @entity11 to become leading goal scorer at the @entity8 @entity61 better than @entity62 ' ; i will look at things when all the adrenaline has left our bodies , sometimes when we look at the match again in the cold light of day we see it in a different way			1
' @entity48 also praised @entity71 midfielder @entity13 for his display after he came off the bench at half - time to replace @entity75 and hinted he could be in the starting line - up for the @entity9 game			1
he added : ' i think @entity13 coming in was critical and we created a number of good chances in attack			0
nature does n’t make leaps , things evolve step by step and this is what we are doing			0
' @entity11 ’s @entity89 coach @entity88 said the team were ' suffering ' from their disappointing @entity8			1
he said : ' over the last two or three years we have not been that good but we managed to qualify for the @entity8 and now we are disappointed we have not won a match			2
evolution : @entity48 praised the goal scoring introduction of @entity71 's @entity13 ' it ’s terrible and we are suffer this but we have gained experience and what we need to do is focus and concentrate for the next challenge			0
' the first half was n’t so bad but it ’s true we need to focus for the whole 90 minutes			0
we need to find the reasons for this - three times we had control of the ball and then lost possession which led to goals			0
' but @entity1 deserved this victory , they created more chances			2
