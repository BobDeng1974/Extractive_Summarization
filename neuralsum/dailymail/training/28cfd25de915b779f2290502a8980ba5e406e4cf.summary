' but it was n't all relaxing : they also endured a beating with eucalyptus leaves , which is supposed to improve circulation , release toxins and ward of illnesses			1
@entity1 called the painful - looking experience ' recreational spanking ' first , the men donned their felt hats and laid down on beds , where their backs were rubbed with oil			1
' do you have three hands ? ' @entity2 asked his masseur			2
' it feels like there 's more than two things going on right now			0
' the two men then grimaced as the leaves , which had been dipped in hot water , were whacked across their backs			0
' that tingles ! ' @entity2 whispered			0
@entity1 quipped : ' i 'm not sure how much more of the recreational spanking i can take			0
' @entity60 : @entity2 said he loved the experience at the baths and claimed it cured a sore shoulder sore : but @entity1 said he was left with a rash that @entity2 said resembled tartare			0
the men were instructed to wear fetching felt hats , designed to protect their heads from the intense heat violent : the popular treatment is supposed to improve circulation , remove toxins and ward off illness sore , they then headed to a large steam bath where hot water was poured on their bodies and a bunch of leaves were placed on top of their heads			1

' ' by making @entity1 and @entity2 soup , ' @entity2 added			0

' hot work : the today duo also ' relaxed ' in a steaming bath which @entity2 called ' @entity1 and @entity2 soup ' not convinced : @entity2 howled as hot water was poured over his head , while @entity1 stayed camouflaged but @entity2 , who said the treatment cured a sore shoulder , was more convinced			1
