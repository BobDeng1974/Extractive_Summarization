writing a journal has been one small factor in @entity3 ’s career revival and , after his try - scoring return for @entity5 at @entity6 on saturday , he knew what the next entry would be			1
‘ probably about the reaction i got , which was very humbling , ’ said the sale fly - half , after his first appearance at hq since 2008			1
the 27 - year - old was touched by the hearty ovation from the capacity crowd when he came on as a last - quarter replacement and he responded by scoring seconds later , as @entity5 put @entity18 to the sword			1
@entity3 vowed that he has learnt his lessons after @entity5 return on saturday the sale fly - half scored in a substitute appearance for @entity5 in their 47 - 17 victory over @entity18 the 27 - year - old said he was touched by the hearty ovation he received from the @entity6 crowd ‘ i did feel like i had been away for a while and it was one of the highlights of my career to get back out there , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the reaction i got from the crowd filled me with confidence			1
i saw @entity36 ( may ) going down the wing and he gave me the pass			1
he did all the work to be honest			2
it was a fast start for me , but it was all down to @entity36			2
i was on the receiving end for once , which was nice			2
’ almost seven years ago , the then @entity41 illuminated the national stadium with a breathtaking playmaker ’s display on his full test debut — orchestrating an emphatic victory over @entity47			2
yet his cameo against the @entity18 was his first outing in the @entity50 since that heady day , as injury , a stint in @entity53 and misgivings about his attitude checked the rise of a stellar talent			2
but he has knuckled down at sale — aided by @entity60 ’s mentor , @entity59 — and forced his way into @entity64 ’s @entity63 plans , as back - up to first - choice fly - half @entity65			1
the @entity68 fly - half said his return to @entity6 was one of the highlights of his career @entity3 ( right ) enjoyed his return to @entity6 as he tackles @entity18 's @entity73 on saturday ( left ) asked how he had changed since he ran amok at @entity6 as a 20 - year - old rookie , @entity3 said : ‘ i ’m just a bit older and uglier i guess ! ‘ i ’ve learned a lot of lessons in the last seven years			1
if someone had told me to meet @entity59 when i was 20 , i would probably have politely declined			2
you do n’t think about those things at that age , but as you get older you mature and see things in a different light			2
you grow up and gaps in your life get filled			0
i just feel like i ’m in a much wiser position and more stable			0
but i ’m only 27 , so i ’m a good three or four years off my peak — and i can still shift about a bit ! ’ back in 2008 , rugby seemed to come easily to @entity3 , even at test level , but he admits that he did n’t savour the honours that came his way			1
in that regard , he is making up for lost time			0
‘ i probably took it for granted a bit back then , ’ he said			0
‘ you do n’t really appreciate the moments as they come along			0
that ’s what i ’m doing now , appreciating every moment and experience and there ’s no way i want to be out of this @entity5 side ever again for as long as i ’m playing			0
i ’m very focused on making the best of my ability			0
’ @entity3 ( right ) has said he is determined to be patient and seize any opportunities that come his way when the national team beat @entity107 at the start of their championship campaign in @entity110 , @entity3 was an unused replacement			1
at @entity6 last weekend he was brought on 17 minutes from the end but made his presence felt			1
he knows that @entity114 will be back from injury and on the coaches ’ radar again long before the @entity63 but @entity3 is determined to be patient and seize any opportunities that come his way			1
‘ any chance i get to get on the field , i try to take it , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone on the bench is like that			0
i am not going to wish anyone else to slip up			0
i am just going to keep working on what i am doing and at some point the opportunity may come			0
‘ it ’s all building blocks and moving forward			0
if i have to come on for 18 or 19 minutes and put my hand up in that time , that ’s what i ’m going to have to do			0
‘ if i have to come on for the last five minutes and kick the leather off the ball or whatever it is , i will keep doing it			0
’ these are the selfless sentiments which have helped @entity3 regain an @entity5 place and prove that he is indeed wiser now .			1
