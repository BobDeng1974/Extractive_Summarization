controversial data collected from @entity2 eavesdropping on @entity4 citizens may have been used by intelligence officials in order to make a deadly drone strike on @entity9 militant leader			1
that ’s what the defense is arguing in a @entity14 terrorism funding case that ’s focused on @entity15 , the same group that recently carried out a deadly attack on the @entity18 shopping mall in @entity19			0
four @entity21 men of @entity9 extraction were convicted of conspiracy to finance and support the @entity9 militant group in february			1
now they argue that data illegally collected on one of them was used to justify the lethal strike and want a new trial			2
illegal ? @entity9 walk through what remained after a @entity4 strike that killed militant leader @entity32 in 2008			1
four men accused of helping fund his group now say intel obtained illegally by the @entity2 led directly to the strike the revelation came thursday from a court filing in which lawyers allege said an @entity42 email they obtained under disclosure rules constitutes evidence which , though cryptic , suggests that data collected by @entity2 eavesdropping on @entity4 citizen @entity47 was used for the missile targeting in 2008			1
questions about whether the data may have been collected illegally will likely fuel fresh controversy over @entity2 spying on @entity4 citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used			1
defense lawyers assert there may be legal grounds for a new trial for four men convicted in the case			0
the email , from an unnamed @entity42 official to an unnamed recipient at another agency , talks about how @entity32 , the senior @entity15 leader based in @entity9 killed in the may 2008 missile strike , tried to call @entity70 in january 2008 but failed to reach him			1
‘ we just heard from another agency that @entity32 tried to make a call to @entity47 today , but the call did n't go through			0
if you see anything today , can you give us a shout ? we 're extremely interested in getting real time info ( location / new # s ) on @entity81 , ’ the email says			0
@entity82 : @entity83 leader @entity32 was killed in the strike			2
@entity4 citizen @entity70 's lawyers now say he was illegally wiretapped for info that led to the strike retrial ? the militant leader was one of around 30 killed in the strike ( aftermath pictured ) , which lawyers for @entity70 say was justified with illegally obtained intel			1
they now want a retrial one of the defense lawyers , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said it was unclear if the information was legally obtained with a warrant			0
the new court filing calls for a new trial and for the @entity4 government to turn over other evidence which may have been withheld at the original trial			0
historically , it has been rare for the @entity4 government to release , either through evidence - sharing rules or under the @entity4 @entity108 , internal government documents relating to counterterrorism armed drone operations			0
the email in question was uncovered during the lengthy government investigation and court proceedings about the four defendants and turned over to defense lawyers			0
revelations this year by former @entity2 contractor @entity118 have provoked a major political debate in the @entity4 on the extent of snooping on @entity4 citizens and residents and its legality			1
in their court filing , the defense lawyers argued that the use of @entity2 eavesdropping authority employed in their case ‘ would be beyond the scope of anything authorized by @entity129 or approved by the ( @entity130 ) - unless of course that is the subject of another set of secret procedures and protocols yet to be exposed and subsequently acknowledged			0
’ ‘ given that the @entity4 government had previously attempted to target mr @entity32 via missile attack ( unsuccessfully ) , and ultimately did so successfully may 1 , 2008 ... the implications of ' real time ' information on mr. @entity32 's whereabouts are obvious , if not altogether ominous , ’ it said			2
in congressional hearings following the @entity118 revelations , law enforcement and intelligence officials publicly cited the @entity21 prosecution as one of a handful of unclassified examples of how @entity2 surveillance had been a key tool in @entity4 counterterrorism efforts , but gave only limited details			2
the @entity2 had no immediate comment and the @entity158 , which has conducted lethal drone operations against militants in @entity9 and other countries , declined to comment			0
renewed criticism ? revelations about @entity164 could renew controversy over @entity2 spying on @entity4 citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used			1

lawyers for @entity21 resident @entity70 and three other men want a retrial for their clients who were convicted of conspiracy to aid the militant group in february
data collected on @entity70 may have led directly to the deadly 2008 drone strike that killed militant leader @entity32
the revelation may *reignite* questions about the legality of the @entity2 's use of data collected from @entity4 citizens
