the police should not become a ' scapegoat ' for the disappearance of three @entity5 schoolgirls who have fled to @entity6 to join @entity7 , @entity0 said today			1
the prime minister insisted politicians , parents , communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well - educated young @entity5 joining the brutal regime			1
his warning came ahead of the family of schoolfriends @entity17 , 15 , @entity18 , 16 , and @entity19 giving evidence to mps about what they say are failures by the police			1
the prime minister insisted politicians , parents , communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well - educated young @entity5 joining the brutal regime police spoke to the three girls just months before they disappeared and found ' no evidence ' that they had been radicalised officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from @entity36 in east @entity37 fled to join @entity7			1
in an interview with @entity39 , mr @entity0 said that no institution should be made a ' scapegoat ' for the girls ' disappearance			2
' i think everyone has a role to play			0
of course we need the police to act as swiftly as they can , we need @entity50 to work as fast as they can			2
' but let 's be frank about this , when you have got educated @entity5 schoolgirls at an outstanding school in @entity55 finding it somehow attractive to get on a plane to travel to @entity6 to go and live in a country where gay people are being thrown off buildings and @entity5 citizens are being beheaded , and appalling brutality is being meted out , we have a problem , clearly , that has got to involve all of us - politicians , parents , communities , schools			1
' everyone has to work together			0
let 's not pretend this is simply a problem that can be dealt with by policing			0
' @entity73 16 , @entity19 15 and @entity17 15 are feared to have travelled to @entity6 via @entity74 the families of the girls have blamed failings by the police for their disappearance last month prime minister @entity0 dismissed as ' nonsense ' the suggestion that jihadis like @entity82 had been radicalised by their contact with security services			1
mr @entity0 told @entity39 radio : ' the fact is we face a terrorist threat in @entity5			0
that is the opinion of the experts who advise me and set the threat level			0
' our police and security services have a very important role to play to find out about people that could do us harm and to step in and prevent them from doing that			2
' of course we need to work with communities to do that - and we do			2
' but i totally reject the idea that police or security service tactics have somehow radicalised people			2
that is , i think , nonsense			0
' campaign group @entity108 sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify @entity82 's brutal killings of @entity7 hostages			0
in an extraordinary press conference , the group 's research director @entity114 said @entity117 - born @entity82 was a ' beautiful young man ' , ' extremely gentle ' and ' the most humble young person that i ever knew '			2
the 32 - year - old blamed @entity5 security services for @entity82 's radicalisation , saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an ' outsider '			2
the girls ' families have called for an apology from metropolitan police commissioner , sir @entity126 after it emerged that letters were given to the girls to hand on to their parents , rather than being sent directly to them			1
the letters were sent to inform parents their children had been friends with a pupil who went to @entity6 weeks earlier and asking for permission to take formal statements			1
they were handed to the girls on february 5 and found hidden in schoolbooks in their bedrooms after the girls left on february 17			0
but mr @entity0 insisted : ' if there are lessons to learn about how quick the reactions were , then i know the police will learn them			0
what i 'm trying to say is i think it would be wrong to try and scapegoat any one organisation when you are dealing with something that is so profound			0
' what is going wrong when girls at an amazing school somehow want to give up all @entity5 offers in terms of freedom and democracy and choice and opportunity ? i 'm not saying our society is perfect , but you can come from anywhere and make it to the top of @entity5			1
we 're an amazing country - why do people want to give that up and be part of an appalling brutal death cult ? ' that goes to a big question about our country that we 've all got to answer , not just the police			1
' last month @entity74 accused the @entity5 authorities of for being too slow to inform it about the three @entity37 schoolgirls who travelled to @entity74 en route to @entity6			1
@entity74 's deputy prime minister @entity179 said he hoped the girls would be found , but that it would be @entity5 , not @entity74 , to blame if they were not			1
but the claims have been rejected by the @entity5 government , who insisted the police and other agencies were quick to act			0
foreign secretary @entity188 spoke to @entity74 's foreign minister on saturday about what action can be taken to stop would - be jihadists from @entity193 countries crossing the country 's border with @entity6 in order to sign up with @entity197			1
he said today : ' @entity74 is doing huge amounts and i would like to record publicly our appreciation of the support we get from the @entity74 authorities , but we are all learning as we go and i think this particular case of the three schoolgirls from east @entity37 has identified some weaknesses and things we can improve , ' said the foreign secretary			0
' but it 's also identified some steps that people in the community could take to keep us safe as well			0
' parents have responsibilities , schools and community workers have responsibilities , as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators			1
' it 's about coming together in this case to protect children - minors , juveniles - who must be protected from themselves , going about something that will be deeply damaging to their own interests as well as our national security interests			0
