by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 fans have ignored the singer 's requests to not film her performances during her 22 - date tour by uploading photographs and videos from the opening night to social media			1
the pop idol had told fans it would ' mean a great deal ' to her if those attending her shows at @entity19 's @entity18 refrained from using iphones , @entity21 or cameras			1
however , footage emerged on @entity24 and @entity25 this morning of last night 's performance - the opening night of the tour which was attended by a host of celebrities including @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
@entity3 had asked fans not to film or take photos at her show , claiming it would ' mean a great deal ' to her			1
however , several videos and photos emerged on @entity24 and @entity25 this morning of the star in action ( above ) some fans had criticised the @entity45 singer for making the ' no filming ' request ahead of her tour one video shows the 56 - year - old singer swaying from side - to - side on stage as she performs @entity53 – the final song of the night – while another , taken from near the back of the venue , is of among @entity57			1
popstar and mother - of - two @entity31 also posted a photograph of the stage before @entity61 made her grand entrance			1
captioning the picture simply with ' @entity66 ' , @entity64 's image shows the stage lit up ahead of the @entity45 singer 's first stage performance in 35 years			0
several fans have hit out at those who uploaded the content , blasting them for not respecting the singer 's wishes			1
writing on her website earlier this month , @entity61 said : ' i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows			0
we have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium			0
' it would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows			1
i very much want to have contact with you as an audience , not with @entity20 , @entity21 or cameras			1
' i know it 's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together			0
' today , one fan wrote under the video of last night 's performance : ' poor video , poor audio , why did you bother ? and is n't this typical of the selfish world we find ourselves in ; no respect for others ' wishes at all			1
' however , while some fans blasted those who uploaded footage to social media , others condemned the star for making the request in the first place			1
some fans blasted those who posted footage online while others criticised the star for making the request the grainy footage was taken by one audience member of the 4,000 - strong crowd at the @entity18 one user , @entity123 , wrote : ' banning all photography / filming in this day and age , i thought she had mellowed from all that egocentric nonsense			1
' meanwhile , @entity128 said : ' i respectfully disagree with @entity3 's request , much as i love her , because even now , i 'm not sure she truly understands how much people love her and would do anything to see her live			0
' i tried like the dickens to get tickets but was unable			0
so should i be condemned forever after to never , ever see her perform ? seems unduly harsh and most @entity135 - like to me			2
' another fan added : ' thank you so so much for sharing this video			2
' not like most of you , i knew about @entity3 only four years ago and obviously became one of her fans			2
' i 'm only 17 and i feel so lucky , lucky enough to see her on stage like this for the first time because i could n't afford the tickets			0
' last night 's show kicked - off the 22 - date tour at the @entity18 , which was chosen because it was the venue of her last gig on may 14 , 1979 - when it was known as the @entity18			1
around 80,000 tickets for the before @entity153 residency sold out within 15 minutes when put on sale earlier this year			2
the video footage goes against the star 's wishes , who asked for no @entity20 , @entity21 or cameras to be present one video shows the 56 - year - old singer swaying from side - to - side on stage as she performs @entity53 the singer is not the first musician to criticise gig - goers who spend their time using their mobile devices rather than watching the show			1
@entity171 , @entity172 , recently said it was ' weird ' that people seemed to spend more time on their phones than watching a show			1
he said : ' i feel sorry for them , i really feel sorry for them			0
looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you 're doing that , you 're 50 per cent there , right ? it 's weird			2
' performance artist @entity188 also recently barred visitors to her exhibition at the @entity191 in @entity19 from bringing in their devices , so they could focus more on the art she was creating			1
critics described the opening show as ' spellbinding ' as @entity61 took to the stage for the first time in 35 years the 56 - year - old singer kicked - off her 22 - date residency at @entity18 in @entity19 last night @entity61 's return to the stage after 35 years went down a storm with critics and fans alike , who hailed her performance as ' spellbinding '			1

comeback queen @entity3 has taken the charts by storm with no fewer than 11 of her albums featuring in today 's midweek @entity214			0
three of her classic singles have also re-entered the charts			0
it comes after the enigmatic singer made a triumphant return to the stage after 35 years in front of a star - studded crowd at the @entity18 last night			1
critics hailed her show a stunning success and her performance made headlines around the world			2
now her hits collection , @entity228 , is hovering inside the @entity230 of the album charts at @entity232 , while five more - @entity233 ( 13 ) , @entity234 ( 25 ) , @entity235 ( 31 ) , @entity236 ( 35 ) and @entity237 ( 37 ) are also potentially heading for a @entity230 slot when the @entity239 is published on sunday night			2

@entity254 , 41 , who had travelled from @entity255 , said : ' we 've just heard musical history			0
i dreamt of this but never thought i 'd see it			0
this was on my bucket list			0
' @entity263 , 46 , had come all the way from @entity265 , said : ' it was worth travelling this far because i 've waited forever to see her			0
it has cost me a lot but it 's definitely worth it			0
' @entity61 soared to fame in 1979 with her single @entity45 , which she wrote when she was just 18			0
the song based on @entity276 's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including @entity279 and @entity248			0
shy of publicity , she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style			2
she was just 20 when she completed @entity288 with three dates at what was then called the @entity18 , after topping the charts with @entity45 the previous year , becoming the first woman to go to number one singing one of her own songs			1
over the years , theories about her absence from the stage have included her perfectionism , a fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew , lighting director @entity303 , during a show			1
but in a rare interview with @entity306 in 2011 to mark a comeback from one of her lengthy recording silences , she explained that her years of absence from the touring circuit were simply down to the sheer exertion of a show			0
she said : ' it was enormously enjoyable			0
but physically it was absolutely exhausting			0
