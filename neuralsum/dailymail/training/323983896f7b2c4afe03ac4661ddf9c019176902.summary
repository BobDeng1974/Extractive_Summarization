@entity0 is on a quest to prove that slim does n't necessarily mean fit - and fat does n't always equate to being unhealthy			1
weighing 15st 7lb , @entity0 runs 5 - 10km four times a week , incorporating a longer run at weekends when training for a marathon			1
she 's set up a website , ' @entity8 ’ guide to running ’ , to help others to start running , whatever their size			1
@entity0 , pictured after completing a marathon , now regularly runs 10k four or more times each week @entity0 set up @entity13 to running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger @entity0 spoke to @entity17 about her mission to prove you do n’t have to be slim to be fit			1
at age 23 and weighing 20st @entity0 , from @entity21 , was unfit and living on diet of fast food , with a very active social life which saw her binge drinking several times a week			1
working on the @entity27 project , @entity0 felt she needed to make an effort with her health			1
‘ a a work colleague convinced me to take part in a 3k fun run			1
with absolutely no training , i almost died on the way round - not only due to the unusual strain on my body , but also from pure embarrassment when a young boy shouted “ @entity39 ” as i passed him			2
‘ that shocked me into taking action and regaining control over my life			0
the following day i signed up for the @entity46 , which i completed just three months later in a @entity49 wetsuit that just about fitted my size 18 body			0
’ despite this , @entity0 admits she made little real progress over the following six years , taking part in fitness events sporadically , with her party lifestyle and unhealthy diet preventing her from making any real strides in fitness or weight loss			2
at first , @entity0 's party lifestyle and unhealthy diet prevented her from making any real strides in fitness it was a comment by a rude spectator ( ' run , fatty , run ' ) during a 3k fun run that sparked @entity0 's campaign to prove bigger women can - and should - run @entity0 , who gave birth to her daughter in january last year , has now changed her diet and is working with a nutritionist to make sure she gets the proper sustenance for training			1
however she insists weight loss is in no way a goal			0
‘ i rarely drink alcohol now and my diet is much more balanced			0
i eat more proper foods and i ’ve stopped eating ‘ diet ’ foods			0
‘ i cook much more food from scratch and snack more healthy on things like fruit and nuts			0
‘ now i ’m a mother i did n’t want to pass on unhealthy habits to my daughter			0
@entity0 's blog about running as a larger lady received thousands of hits , so set up her website ' @entity13 to running ' ‘ i also want to be a good role model for people			1
i do n’t want to say you can eat literally whatever you want as long as you exercise and be healthy because that is n’t the case			0
‘ obesity is a huge concern around the world , but inactivity is the big killer of our time			0
many people simply think that running is something that fat women ca n’t or should n’t do at all , including some medical professionals - i am on a mission to prove otherwise			2
’ @entity0 set up @entity8 ’ guide to running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger or a mother , as well as nutrition tips , events as well as running campaigns such as ‘ kit that fits ’ which encourages companies to make workout clothes available in larger sizes			1
@entity0 says : ‘ the blog was going on in the background telling my story and i started to get people coming to me asking for advice			2
‘ it was getting upwards of 10,000 hits and i started to think , this is something i am really passionate about and i could do it full time			0
’ the website , which advocates the @entity145 approach or @entity145 , states : ‘ being overweight in this modern world is not an easy thing what with the @entity150 obsession with an unachievable idea of “ the @entity152 ” the pressure to be a certain size and to live a healthy lifestyle has never been stronger			2
@entity0 now runs day - long retreats for women where , as well as running , they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active ‘ but we all know that slim does not equal fit , and fat does not always equate to being unhealthy , or inactive , or lazy , or … all of those other negative connotations that it has acquired over the years			1
‘ @entity145 is n’t suggesting that everyone of every size is always healthy – a popular misconception			0
instead , it focuses on helping anyone interested in being as healthy as they can be in the body they have right now			0
@entity174 with this it challenges size stigma to advance equality			2
’ @entity0 hopes to continue to expand the website , and now runs day long retreats for women where , as well as running , they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active .			1

@entity0 began training after a comment from a spectator at a 3k fun run
now running regular marathons , @entity0 wants to show you can be fat and fit
she 's now set up a website to help larger ladies start running and remove stigma
