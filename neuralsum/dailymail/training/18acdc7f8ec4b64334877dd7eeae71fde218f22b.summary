president @entity0 has a final chance in @entity2 tonight night to halt @entity4 ’s late surge and stave off a re-election defeat after plummeting in the polls after his disastrous first debate performance			1
@entity0 leads by a wafer - thin 0.2 per cent nationally in the @entity10 poll of averages			2
but he is down seven in the @entity13 tracking poll , down two in the @entity15 poll and has seen his leads in @entity2 and @entity17 disappear and his @entity19 advantage whittled down to almost nothing			0
the big stage : @entity23 students serve as stand - ins during final preparations for the debate practice run : stand - ins for @entity30 president @entity0 , right , and @entity4 , left , and moderator @entity31 , center , participate in a rehearsal a day ahead of the final presidential debate at @entity23 the latest @entity37 / @entity36 poll , which had @entity0 three points ahead before the debates , now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided			1
although most pundits and post-debate polls have @entity0 the advantage over @entity4 following the second debate , he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the @entity53 nominee			1
the final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional @entity53 strength that should be an advantage for @entity0 this time around because of the demise of @entity58 last may and the end of the @entity61 war			1
indeed , @entity0 has served notice that he will play the @entity58 card to full advantage , saying in his speech at the @entity67 dinner in @entity68 last week : ' spoiler alert : we got @entity58			2
' stunt double : @entity23 student @entity72 , a stand - in for president @entity0 , walks off stage during final preparations for monday 's presidential debate at the vice-presidential debate in @entity80 , it took vice president @entity81 one minute and seven seconds into the first answer of the debate - to a question about @entity85 - to bring up @entity58			1
@entity85 , however , presents @entity0 with some problems			2
although @entity4 got tangled up in the weeds of whether @entity0 had referred to the @entity95 attack as a ' terrorist act , ' during their last bout , the death of the first @entity30 ambassador to be murdered in the line of duty since 1979 and the intelligence and security failures that led to it make the president very vulnerable			1
in addition , it has become clear that the @entity103 ’s initial insistence that the attack was a result of protests about an anti-islam video made in @entity107 were flat wrong - and possibly part of an official cover - up			0
dinner date : @entity4 , and his wife @entity111 , order dinner for their family at @entity115 for on sunday , one day before the last presidential debate one last debate : @entity4 and @entity0 , pictured during last week 's debate at @entity119 , will get together for the third and final time before @entity120 setting the stage : a worker adjusts the backdrop on stage in preparation for monday 's presidential debate between @entity0 and @entity4 @entity127 : @entity0 is pictured yesterday during a conference call from @entity129 cleaning house : a worker vacuums the stage as the set for monday 's presidential debate is prepared prep : @entity136 adjusts set lights on the spin corner in the media center for the @entity4 campaign despite his mistakes , and a disastrous visit to @entity143 in august when he managed to offend people by criticising the @entity143 @entity146 effort and was mocked by prime minister @entity147 and mayor of london @entity148 , @entity4 has become much more fluent in foreign policy matters			1
before the two candidates first debated on october 3rd , @entity0 held a 15 - point lead over @entity4 on the question of who was more capable of dealing with foreign affairs			1
after @entity0 ’s lackluster performance , a @entity157 poll found that the gap had closed to just four points			2
on the eve of their final presidential debate , @entity4 and @entity0 - through their allies - squared off sunday over which candidate would best protect the nation 's interests and security abroad with just two weeks left in a race that polls show is increasingly tight			1

republicans accused @entity0 of leaking word of possible negotiations with @entity204 in pursuit of political gain			0
democrats shot back , arguing that @entity4 and his party are the ones playing politics with national security			0
the haggling played out on sunday news shows at a critical time for @entity4 and @entity0 , whose marathon race has become exceedingly close as it lurches toward its november conclusion			2
early and absentee voting are already under way in many of the most competitive states , upping the pressure on both candidates to lock in supporters			0
@entity4 paused his preparations to attend church with his wife sunday morning and to watch his traveling press corps play touch football against his senior staff			0

' that 's right , do n't worry about injuries guys , this counts			0
win , ' he joked			0
@entity4 did n't talk politics , refusing to answer a question about whether , if elected , he would be open to direct talks with @entity204			0
