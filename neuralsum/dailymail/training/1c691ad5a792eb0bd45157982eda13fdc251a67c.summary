it is thought most of the bodies were members of the ancient @entity2 elite , and inscriptions suggest the tomb contains a prince and princess , related to two pharaohs who ruled during the 14th century @entity14 but excavation was n’t easy because the tomb is covered in soot - from a fire started by grave robbers in the late 19th century			1

experts identified the burial place of several children as well as other family members of two pharaohs			0
the team have been working on tomb @entity26 - where the find was made - close to the city of @entity79 for three years			2
from the outside , only a depression in the ground indicated the presence of a subterranean tomb			0
up to now , nothing was known about the layout of tomb @entity26 , nor for whom it was built and who was buried there			0
the @entity33 assumed it was a non-royal tomb dating back to the 18th dynasty ( 1543 – 1292 bc )			0
they first cleared the 20ft ( six metre ) deep shaft which gives access to five subterranean chambers before recovering the countless remains and fragments of funerary equipment			0
the scientists discovered mummified remains of at least 50 people in the centre chamber and in three side chambers			1
based on inscriptions on storage jars , @entity33 were able to identify and name over 30 people			0
titles such as ' prince ' and ' princess ' distinguish the buried as members of the families of the two pharaohs @entity114 and @entity115 who are also buried in the @entity21			2
both pharaohs belonged to the 18th dynasty and ruled in the 14th century @entity14 the analysis of the hieratic inscriptions , related to hieroglyphics , revealed that tomb @entity121 contains the mummified remains of at least eight hitherto unknown royal daughters , four princes and several foreign ladies			1
while most of them were adults , mummified children were also found			2
' we discovered a remarkable number of carefully mummified newborns and infants that would have normally been buried much simpler , ' explains egyptologist professor @entity134			0
' we believe that the family members of the royal court were buried in this tomb for a period of several decades			2
' the identification of people buried in the proximity of the royal tombs gave the team of researchers important insight into who had the privilege to spend eternal life close to the pharaoh			0
' roughly two thirds of the tombs in the @entity152 are non-royal , ' continued @entity134			0
' because the tombs do not have inscriptions and have been heavily plundered we so far have only been able to speculate on who lies buried in them			0
' the tomb was found in the @entity21 , a valley in egypt where pharoahs and nobles from the 18th , 19th and 20th dynasties ( known as the ' @entity43 ' ) in @entity38 were buried from the 16th to 11th century @entity14 amongst other tombs , the valley is famous for containing that of @entity166 @entity167 40 containing the newly discovered remains was found about 20ft ( six metres ) underground with a corridor , a central room and three side rooms			1
most of the walls and ceilings are black from heavy fire , believed to have been caused by regular plunderers in ancient times but also as recently as the 19th century this is a panorama view over the area in the @entity21 investigated by the @entity35 ' @entity34			1
@entity181 is located directly next to tomb @entity182 and was first discovered by the @entity33 in 2012 , but it has only recently been excavated and studied even though the tomb was looted in ancient times as well as at the end of the 19th century , the researchers found countless fragments of burial equipment , such as fragments of coffins and textiles			1
' the remains and the walls have been heavily affected by a fire that was most likely ignited by the torches of the tomb raiders , ' suspects @entity134			2
the fragments of various wooden and cartonnage , layers of linen or papyrus covered with plaster , coffins indicate that tomb @entity26 was used a second time as a burial ground by members of priestly families in the 9th century @entity14 anthropological analysis , as well as further examination on the burial goods , will deliver important insight into the composition of the pharaonic court of the 18th dynasty as well as the conditions of life and the burial customs of its members .			1
