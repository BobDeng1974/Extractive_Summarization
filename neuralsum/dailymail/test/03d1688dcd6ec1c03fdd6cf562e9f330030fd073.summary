@entity0 has developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online			1
the system would allow machines to download them in a similar way to an app - and even have a different personality for each user			0
' above it @entity23 , which according to @entity0 - owned @entity24 , is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain			1
according to @entity0 owned @entity24 , @entity23 is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain			1
' @entity23 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			1
' in extremely challenging terrain , @entity23 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			1
' @entity0 's patent details a cloud - based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot , in the same way one might download an app. ' the robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct ( i.e. , a default - persona ) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness , fear , surprise , perplexion ( e.g. , the @entity52 robot ) , thoughtfulness , derision ( e.g. , the @entity56 robot ) , and so forth , ' states the patent			1
friends will even be able to clone their robots and swap aspects of its personality			0
' the personality and state may be shared with other robots so as to clone this robot within another device or devices			2
' in this manner , a user may travel to another city , and download within a robot in that city ( another ' skin ' ) the personality and state matching the user 's ' home location ' robot			2
' the robot personality thereby becomes transportable or transferable			2
' the firm also explains ' this disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality , or personalities			1
' in particular , but without limitation , the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities			2
' personality may be thought of as personification in the sense of human characteristics or qualities attributed to a non-human thing			0
' a robot can be programmed to provide a desired look as well as interactability for the robot , which may be subject to change by the user or by the robot itself , such that the robot interface is customized to provide a desired personality for the robot			2
' @entity0 already owns several firms developing robotic technology , including @entity23 , 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk , run , jump and even open doors			1
this is latest version of the @entity23 robot created by @entity24 , a @entity0 - owned robot firm			1
later this year , seven of the robots will compete in a ' robo oylmpics ' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into			0
a total of $ 3.5 million in prizes will now be awarded to the top three finishers in the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , the final event of which will be held june 5 - 6 , 2015 , at @entity126 in @entity18			0
aside from the previously announced $ 2 million grand prize , @entity122 plans to award $ 1 million to the runner - up and $ 500,000 to the third - place team			0
@entity0 's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them @entity122 expects at least twenty teams to compete in the @entity123 finals			1
' the goal of the @entity123 is to generate groundbreaking research and development in hardware and software that will enable future robots , in tandem with human counterparts , to perform the most hazardous activities in disaster zones , thus reducing casualties and saving lives , ' it said			0
the teams using the @entity122 - developed @entity23 robot will use an entirely new version , which is battery powered for the first time			1
the @entity23 robot created by @entity0 - owned firm @entity24 is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb			1
the robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision , and is one of the most advanced robots ever created			2
@entity23 will also now carry an onboard 3.7 - kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery pack , with the potential for one hour of ' mixed mission ' operation that includes walking , standing , use of tools , and other movements			1
the upgraded @entity23 is 75 percent new — only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design @entity167 , of @entity122 said : ' @entity23 unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries			1
' we have to cut the cord			0
' ' the new @entity23 is 75 % new , it has much more dexterity and is quieter , and stronger			1
' the introduction of a battery and variable - pressure pump into @entity23 poses a strategic challenge for teams , ' said @entity178			1
' the operator will be able to run the robot on a mid-pressure setting for most operations to save power , and then apply bursts of maximum pressure when additional force is needed			0
' during the finals , a series of events will be held to replicate disasters			0
' the finals will be very hard			0
we want them to be more like real disasters , the robots will have to do all these tasks in sequence with no human help			0
given their identical hardware , the @entity23 teams will have to differentiate themselves through software , control interfaces , and competition strategy			1
other firms are already developing robots with ' friendly ' personalities teams will have a few options on the selection of tasks they choose to attempt and the order they do them — and must manage time and battery life during their runs — but @entity122 expects that the top - placing teams will complete all of the tasks			0
teams are likely to keep their robots connected to fall arrestors during much of the remaining months of training as a safeguard against premature damage to the robot			0
@entity122 demonstrated the new @entity23 with a fall arrestor in place			1
' risk mitigation is part of the game , ' @entity178 said			0
' it 's up to the teams to decide what chances they 're willing to take during training and risk falls and damage , but come the @entity238 , the cords are cut			0
' the researchers even taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process			0
the @entity23 robot has already shown it can walk , jump and even drive a car however , it 's not just karate - @entity247 has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the @entity250 which allows him to drive a car			1
' to achieve this level of maneuverability in robots , researchers at @entity255 look toward nature , ' the team say			0
' inspired by the speed of cheetahs , the endurance of horses , the maneuverability of monkeys , and the versatility of humans , @entity255 researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast , efficient , and graceful , with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can			0
' at the @entity274 's @entity273 , @entity247 came second , despite competing as a virtual software simulation			0
despite his lack of limbs , the world 's most innocuously named ' bot was able to walk , carry a fire hose and , most impressively , get in a car and drive it			0
the ' crane ' stance , being held by @entity286 @entity285 ( played by @entity287 left ) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the @entity23 robot			1
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the @entity0 - owned machine , said the firm @entity23 is a high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain , @entity24 said			1
' @entity23 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			2
in extremely challenging terrain , @entity23 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			2
the @entity23 robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can ' see ' where it is going			1
' articulated , sensate hands will enable @entity23 to use tools designed for human use			2
@entity23 includes 28 hydraulically - actuated degrees of freedom , two hands , arms , legs , feet and a torso			2
' an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder			0
' @entity23 is powered from an off - board , electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this .			2
