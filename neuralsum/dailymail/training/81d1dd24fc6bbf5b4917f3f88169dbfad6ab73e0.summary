separately , the @entity48 , which includes @entity49 and @entity50 , has also issued profits warnings			0

@entity12 acquires @entity92 in 1996 and increased its store portfolio to over 250 stores nationwide			2
leading retail specialist @entity95 said , in @entity97 in 2001 , that @entity12 's new concept ' destination stores ' pose a serious threat to all competitors in the electricals industry			1
in 2005 the stores undergo a £ 20million re-branding campaign , mainly to differentiate itself from competitors such as @entity49			0
its policy was called @entity107 , with the promise that they ’d check competitors ’ prices and reduce theirs to match			0
but @entity12 regularly faced criticism for poor customer service issues and were investigated by @entity114 for allegedly refusing to refund faulty products			2
the store saw its retail profits increase steadily from the years 2000 to 2005 , reaching £ 52million , but since 2008 has seen dramatic decreases due to competitive trading in the economic downturn			0
revenues fell 22 per cent over this summer alone			0
the firm has already announced plans to shut one of @entity12 ’s three warehouses , axe 12 of its 14 regional service centres and close nine under - performing stores as part of a cost - cutting drive			2
the remaining staff will inevitably fear further closures and redundancies			0
@entity13 chairman , @entity133 , explained the decision to pay the new owners to take over @entity12 , saying : ‘ the £ 50million is categorized as an investment but the truth of the matter is we had to pay £ 50million to get the business away			1
we will be writing it off as having no value			0
’ @entity13 has sold the business for a nominal £ 2 to investment company @entity144 , which is run by the millionaire former investment banker , @entity33 , who claims expertise in turning around failing retailers			1
he is married to @entity149 - born singer @entity27 , a mother of four who is described as a @entity152 ‘ yummy mummy ’ and had an unlikely @entity45 dance chart hit earlier this year with ‘ live it up ’ , featuring rapper @entity29			0
mr @entity33 ’s predecessor investment company – @entity144 - bought @entity157 for just £ 1 in 2006 and then sold it to managers in 2008			1
despite its involvement , the business subsequently went bust			0
retail analyst @entity162 , of @entity163 , said he could understand the reason for the fire sale			0
‘ clearly , the board has decided that sustaining @entity12 ’s losses into an uncertain future is the wrong thing to do and it is difficult to disagree with them , ’ he said			1
this week , the @entity172 detailed the tough trading conditions for electrical chains in the past month			1
it said : ‘ it was another tough month , with sales largely promotion - led and often for replacement purposes rather than upgrades			0
