a new book of photographs has given a haunting insight into the lives of people who were held in institutions that used to be called ' lunatic asylums ' in @entity7			1
photographer @entity8 spent more than six years travelling to abandoned former psychiatric hospitals , where patients were treated for a range of mental health problems			1
his book , @entity14 , captures the remains of 17 buildings , including @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
it is important for us to remember these asylums in order for us to ensure we do not make the same mistakes			0
' his work on the asylums was sparked by an interest in justice , which caused him to look deeper into the lives of the patients who were usually condemned to spend their entire lives in the institutions			1
' what is most shocking about these places is the fact the people actually seemed quite normal , ' said mr @entity8			0
distressed state : faded green sheets that would have provided privacy for the patients in their hospital beds at @entity71 padded cell : the crumbling walls of a holding area for distressed patients at the @entity20 in @entity22 grave : a battered and rusting wheelchair abandoned at @entity77 gives an insight into the abandoned buildings distressed : an abandoned and dishevelled corridor at @entity17 at @entity40 in @entity81 , @entity41 ' you only hear of the most grotesque of cases but many people committed to asylums were in there suffering from illnesses such as depression due to loss of a husband , or even their job			1
' to make these situations even more harrowing to hear is that once a person entered one of the asylums , it was very likely they would not come out even when cured			0
' according to mr @entity8 , many of the patients were detained if they had useful skills and given roles such as a seamstress or a builder because they would carry out such tasks for free			0
dumped : blankets and other debris from the hospital litter the floor of this room at what was once the @entity19 @entity110 an empty bath remains in place among broken doors and fallen ceiling at @entity115 at @entity116 in @entity115 abandoned : a painting of a teddy bear and an old wheelchair are a reminder of the people who once lived within the walls of @entity71 , @entity22 place of confinement : @entity17 at @entity40 , @entity81 , @entity41 mr @entity8 began his journey around asylums in 2008 along with other photographers but later discovered going in alone helped him to transcend the atmosphere of each building			1
he said : ' you would be surprised how easy it is to gain access to certain abandoned asylums			2
many had the front door left swinging in the wind for anyone to enter			0
' the one that struck me the most was @entity34 in @entity141			0
it is surrounded by a creepy woods near these abandoned villas and is the closest thing to being in a horror movie			0
' empty shell : @entity14 at @entity148 , @entity149			2
many of the buildings featured in the book are due to be demolished afterlife : an abandoned room rots away at @entity17 at @entity40 in @entity81 , @entity41			2
whistle - blower : a whistle used to sound the alarm in emergencies , left			0
surgical instruments , right , left out at @entity161 and @entity162 hospital in mid @entity163 rotting away : a flooded recreation area where patients would have once gathered to chat at @entity20 in @entity22 in 1914 , there were 102 registered ' lunatic ' asylums across @entity7 with many of the @entity171 structures being beautifully designed			1
according to the book : ' @entity173 asylums were built at a rapid rate to cater for society 's intolerance to behaviour and the increasing human wreckage associated with the newly industrialised society			2
' to some , being committed to an asylum was worse than going to prison with asylums ' only having 30 to 50 per cent discharge rate			0
grandeur and decay : the arched ceiling of the @entity187 provides a contrast to the dust - covered floor and graffiti beneath coat room : jackets , trousers and a suitcase belonging to former patients have been left in this room at @entity20 parked up : an abandoned bike left in a room at @entity199 @entity14 however , some asylums were that well designed that patients found the facilities were of a better standard than their current living conditions			1
mr @entity8 added : ' many of the patients at these asylums came from poor backgrounds , so when they arrived in such places as @entity17 , who really went to town with the design and mosaics , they were humbled by being there and would do as they were told just to stay			2
' the book , which is published by @entity216 and also written by @entity8 , is now available			0
