@entity1 boss @entity0 sees this weekend ’s early - season clash with title rivals @entity3 as a ‘ must - win ’ encounter			1
@entity0 ’s men are just four games into their @entity8 title defence , but already trail leaders @entity3 by five points			1
the thought of falling eight points behind by losing at the @entity13 is one @entity0 does not want to contemplate			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned his team they must pick up three points on sunday @entity0 believes @entity1 were unlucky to lose to @entity16 in midweek recent results do not make good reading for @entity1 , who have not won in three in all competitions , but @entity0 is focusing on turning statistics in his favour with a victory			1
the @entity24 said : ' i always try to think of positives , so i hope we are not going to lose and we not going to go eight points behind @entity3			2
' i think we were unlucky in the last two games - against @entity16 in the way we lost with that goal and against @entity31 we deserved to win the three points			2
we must win our next game at home and with that we will be two points behind the leader			0
' that for me will be a very good start after playing @entity39 , @entity31 and @entity3			2
that is why it is important to win on sunday			2
' @entity1 will need to find a way to halt @entity3 ’s in - form striker @entity43 , who has hit the ground running at @entity45			1
the @entity24 tactician is wary of the threat posed by @entity3 's in - form striker @entity43 the £ 32million @entity49 international has scored seven in his first four @entity8 appearances , including a hat - trick against @entity54 last weekend			1
another summer signing , @entity56 , has also made a big impression and quickly built up a dangerous understanding with @entity43			0
@entity0 said : ' they have very good players and they are in a very good moment , so we have to play a very good game if we want to win			1
' for me it is not a surprise			0
last year it was a very strong squad with very good players and this year they have increased their squad , they have more and better players			0
' but there is a long way to go , it is just four games and we play 38			0
we will see what happens in future			0
' i think that we did n’t start badly			0
maybe the game we lost here against @entity78 that was an unusual game , but we hope we recover here , playing at home , and get three points on sunday			0
' @entity0 , as is usually the case , refused to be drawn into speaking about @entity3 boss @entity84 when he spoke to media at his press conference to preview the match			1
@entity84 will be hoping his side can extend their 100 per cent record in the @entity8 @entity0 and @entity84 have a rivalry dating back to when the latter succeeded the former as @entity94 boss in 2010			1
' it is nothing important , ' the @entity24 said			0
' every time you ask me the same question when we play against @entity84			2
' i do n’t have any problem with him			0
this profession - we manage in different ways and nothing more			0
' city are still without striker @entity107 and midfielder @entity108 due to injury , but @entity0 is planning to unleash @entity110			1
@entity110 is expected to start against @entity3 after proving his fitness to his manager the @entity114 forward has been used only sparingly this term as he is eased back into action following a series of muscle injuries in the second half of last season , including the @entity121			1
@entity110 has found the net three times this season , but played only 16 minutes in the @entity124 loss at @entity16 in midweek			1
@entity0 said : ' he is very important			2
maybe @entity110 in this moment is not ready to play three games in one week ( of ) 90 minutes			2
' that is why i thought it was better for him and the squad not to play 90 minutes against @entity16			0
' he is fresh for sunday and i am sure he will make a difference			0

the citizens host @entity3 at the @entity13 on sunday *afternoon*
@entity0 believes his side 's *fixture* against @entity3 is a ' must - win '
@entity110 is expected to be unleashed against @entity84 's side after starting his side 's @entity124 encounter from the bench
