with new phones being released almost monthly , signing up to a 24 - month contract for one particular handset can be a gamble , and getting out of contracts can work out more expensive than buying a brand new handset out right			1
to tackle this problem , network operator @entity6 has launched its swap scheme that lets customers upgrade to a new device just six months into an 18 - month or two - year contract , and pay just a one - off fee			1
swap is available to customers already on @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity6 plans and after six months they can return their device and get an upgrade to a brand new phone on a 24 - month contract on @entity15			1
@entity24 's first @entity23 , run by @entity6 , launches today - but has come under fire for its high prices then , if within the next six months a better phone comes out , they can swap again			1
the amount a customer pays as a one - off fee depends on which contract they are on			2
for example , people who currently have a £ 51 per month @entity15 contract will pay just £ 49 to break the contract and upgrade to a new phone and plan			1
if the same customer , on a 24 - month plan , had to pay off the rest of their contract after six months they would pay £ 918			1
the most expensive example given by @entity6 was for customers on a £ 36 per month @entity47			2
to upgrade through the @entity13 scheme they would have to pay £ 249 , compared to buying out their contract for £ 648			1
@entity6 's @entity13 scheme applies to existing @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity6 customers			1
plans can be upgraded after six months for a one - off fee			1
if within the next six months a better phone comes out , they can swap again			0
the amount a customer pays as a one - off fee depends on which contract they are on			2
on @entity62 , the customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services , called the @entity67 payment , and a separate monthly amount for the ' network airtime agreement '			0
the @entity67 agreement can be upgraded after six months			0
the amount a customer will pay to jump varies by handset and contract			0
@entity77 's @entity76 service lets existing customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract			1
refresh contracts are split in two and customers pay a phone plan and a network plan			0
customers can upgrade at any time			0
then when it comes to upgrading , @entity77 lets customers pay off just their phone plan , and not their airtime plan			2
according to the terms and conditions , customers must already have a device on an eligible plan			0
the phone must also be ' in good working order , with no significant dents , scratches , or cracks on the screen			0
' @entity6 's @entity13 scheme is similar to @entity104 's jump tariff that splits contract agreements into two			1
the customer pays one monthly amount for the handset and services , called the jump payment , and then a separate monthly amount for the ' network airtime agreement '			0
with @entity113 poised to launch a new handset , customers with the @entity116 , pictured , could upgrade after just six months with @entity13 they can then upgrade their jump agreement after six months , while the network agreement stays the same			1
the amount a customer will pay to jump varies by handset and contract			0
network provider @entity77 's @entity76 service also lets customers upgrade their handsets before the end of their contract and similarly splits the agreement into two			1
however , on @entity76 customers can upgrade at any point			0
when the time comes to upgrade , @entity77 lets customers then pay off just their phone plan , and not their airtime plan			2
for example , after five months of a two - year , £ 32 - a - month @entity76 contract the customer pays £ 285 to upgrade , rather than £ 608 with other operators			1
@entity140 , mobiles expert at @entity141 , told @entity142 : ' being able to move into the mobile fast lane for a one - off fee could be the offer many consumers need to make the switch			0
' buying your way out of a contract has never been easy or cheap , but this scheme keeps things straightforward			0
' however , tying the one - off fee into the tariff type could prove to be a blessing and a curse			0
' customers looking to move just six months into a 24 - month contract will be the winners , whereas those in sight of the finish line may feel hard done by			2
' but it ’s hard to keep everyone happy , and what @entity6 has done is simplify the process and ' swap ' could give those @entity6 customers with a phone in good condition the chance to enjoy @entity169 without the hefty outlay they may have feared			2

@entity13 lets contract customers upgrade their phones for a one - off fee
upgrades can be made after just six months of two - year contract
customers must upgrade to a @entity15 plan to qualify
scheme starts *17* *september* and is open to @entity6 , @entity16 and @entity6 plans
