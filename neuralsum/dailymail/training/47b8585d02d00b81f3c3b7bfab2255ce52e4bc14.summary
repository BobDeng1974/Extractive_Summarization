by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 07:39 est , 1 april 2013 an agricultural research group is hoping to breed hypoallergenic apple by identifying varieties that do not cause an allergic reaction			1
apples are not usually associated with allergies			0
however , 75 per cent of people suffering from an allergy to birch pollen are also allergic to apples			1
those sensitive to the fruit can still experience unpleasant irritation and blistering of the tongue and lips			1
tasty treat : some apple varieties such as @entity17 and @entity18 are part of the high - allergenic group , whereas @entity21 and @entity22 induce only low allergenic responses experts including molecular biologists , plant physiologists and allergy specialists are genetically mapping out the apple in a bid to find hypoallergenic variants the can crossbreed			1
but the team is being cautious when it comes to the impact of updating the apple			0
‘ you can not know what will happen when you silence an endogenous gene , ’ plant physiologist , @entity36 told @entity37 , explaining that the effects of a genetic switch would need to be monitored for unintended side effects			0
however , allergies are not static so what starts off as a hypoallergenic apple could still begin to cause irritation in consumers over time			0
‘ some people who are allergic may simply say they do n’t like apples , since they ’ve a very mild reaction after eating them , ’ @entity49 , plant scientist at @entity50 in the @entity51 told @entity52			2
‘ but others will suffer blistering , problems catching their breadth and swollen lips , tongue and throat			1
’ the problem with projects like this is that a large section of the public are not willing to eat genetically engineered foods			2
the reduction of allergens in the food chain is extremely important though , says @entity72 , an expert in risk communication in @entity74 , @entity75			0
researchers are creating a hypoallergenic apple by substituting natural proteins for those that do n't cause an allergic reaction ‘ although consumers – and in particular food - allergic consumers – were more positive about the [ @entity87 ] apple , there was still a clear preference for traditional breeding methods applied to the same end if possible , even for food allergic consumers , ’ she says			2
however , @entity93 rather than @entity87 may offer alternative solutions			0
‘ there are hundreds of apple varieties already available , ’ says @entity95 , a plant geneticist at the @entity96 , @entity97 , ' and some of these may hold answers '			0
for instance , it is known that apple varieties such as @entity17 and @entity18 are part of the high - allergenic group , whereas @entity21 and @entity22 induce only low allergenic responses .			1

people with an allergy to apples can suffer from blistering , problems catching their breadth , swollen lips , tongue and throat
some varieties are in the high allergy group , such as @entity17
but some sectors of the public are still *reluctant* to eat @entity87 food
