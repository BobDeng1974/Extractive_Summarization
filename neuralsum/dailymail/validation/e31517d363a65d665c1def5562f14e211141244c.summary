dinner with @entity1 on thursday night clearly agreed with @entity3 1 @entity2			1
all those indifferent rounds in @entity5 so far this year were swept aside on friday as the @entity6 notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the @entity12			1
it was the first time in eight rounds in the @entity5 this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it			1
from out of the pack , the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale - boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career @entity26 at the @entity28 next month			1
@entity2 hit a second round of 66 at the @entity12 on friday it was the first time in eight rounds in @entity5 this year that the @entity31 had broken 70 @entity2 looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the @entity28 next month ‘ i ’m just feeling more comfortable day by day , and it was great to see a few putts finally drop , ’ said @entity2 , whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner , @entity36			1
‘ after what i saw today and the fact he ’s clearly the best player in the world , he has to be the favourite for the masters , ’ said the @entity39 , who was pipped at the post to both @entity42 and @entity43 last year by @entity2			1
‘ that course suits his game			2
he did n’t start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine , it ’s hard to hang with him			0
if he continues to play like that , he will be ready for @entity57 , for sure			0
’ @entity36 was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for @entity2 over his front nine , the inward half on the course			1
in fact , he ’d played much better on the first day , when he opened with a 70			2
but after finally getting a putt to drop at the second , and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third , where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards , it all started to click			0
a good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth			0
at the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth , where he got up and down from a greenside bunker			2
‘ it ’s a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy , ’ he said			0
@entity86 's good friend and playing partner @entity36 admitted @entity2 is now favourite for the masters @entity2 had five birdies in a row in @entity91 earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the @entity96 , and it electrified the huge galleries at @entity99			1
by this stage he had gone from being nowhere near the leader board into a tie for second place			2
not even a bogey at his penultimate hole could dampen his enthusiasm			0
‘ it was obviously not the finish i was looking for but i ’m still exactly where i wanted to be , with a real chance to win the tournament going into the weekend , ’ he said			0
@entity2 will actually begin the third round on saturday five shots behind @entity39 pacesetter , @entity114 , who has played brilliantly so far to post blistering rounds of 66 and 65			1
but can the little - known @entity114 keep it going ? the @entity119 native is the same age as 25 year old @entity2 but there the comparison ends			1
a solitary top three finish in 67 starts on the @entity96 suggests he could struggle over the weekend			0
three shots off the pace are world no 3 @entity128 and defending champion @entity129 , while @entity2 is not the only big name from the @entity131 in position to have a crack at winning this prestigious title			1
@entity129 is also in the mix , three shots behind surprise leader @entity114 @entity137 is in contention at halfway after rounds of 67 and 70 put him one shot behind @entity2 for the third week out of four in @entity5 , @entity137 is in contention at halfway , standing just a shot behind @entity2 following rounds of 67 and 70			1
he also gave a positive bulletin on his three year old son , @entity144 , who is making a good recovery from pneumonia			2
‘ it was great to see him looking a lot perkier than when i left for the course this morning , ’ he said			0
@entity151 , who began this @entity5 swing with an amazing comeback victory at the @entity154 , is also in the top 20 at halfway after rounds of 68 and 71			2
but there ’s no getting away from the man who will attract nearly all the attention this weekend			0
as for that dinner with @entity1 , @entity2 was still buzzing			1
‘ it was fantastic , it really was , ’ he said			0
‘ we spoke for two and a half hours and he was telling stories of the old days and some of the things he ’ s done from a commercial standpoint			0
he was very close to his father just like i am and he shared a few stories about that			0
it was just great to be in his presence and enjoy his company			0
’ @entity174 hits his tee - shot on the picturesque 11th hole at the @entity177			2

@entity2 five shots behind leader @entity114 at @entity99
@entity31 had dinner with @entity1 on thursday night
@entity36 says @entity2 must be favourite for the @entity28 next month
