their crude camera was smuggled into the camp in sausages and carefully hidden away in a hollowed out dictionary			1
the precious 8mm film stored in the soles of their home made shoes			1
had they been discovered it would have likely meant a firing squad			2
but for a group of daring @entity15 @entity17 prisoners incarcerated in a @entity19 pow camp in 1940 , it was a risk worth taking			1
the 30 minutes of footage they captured entitled @entity40 ( under @entity41 ) now serves as a unique historical record giving a fascinating glimpse into what life was really life in the @entity46 - run prison camps			1
the incredible story of the @entity15 prisoners ' secret camera is being celebrated in @entity52 this week after the only living prisoner who managed to escape the camp and make it back to @entity15 celebrated his 100th birthday , the @entity48 reports			1
lt @entity58 was among 5,000 officers marched to @entity60 situated close to the @entity62 border following their defeat in the battle of @entity15			2
covert operation : the camera was hidden in a hollowed out dictionary and the film was stored in the soles of their home - made shoes originally built for @entity19 troops it was a sprawling camp composed of 40 barracks and surrounded by two lines of barbed wire with lookout towers and floodlights guarding the perimeter			1
life was bleak and monotonous and with little food many of the prisoners were left on the brink of starvation			1
but they refused to allow their spirits to be broken			2
realising that when the @entity19 soldiers checked food deliveries they only cut down the middle , the prisoners arranged for camera parts to be brought in smuggled in the ends of sausages			1
once assembled a hollowed out dictionary from the camp library served as the perfect hiding place with the spine of the book opening up like a shutter			2
high security : the camp was surrounded by two lines of barbed wire and with lookout towers and flashlights used to guard the perimeter a cape - wearing pow is seen holding the dictionary used to hide the camera as he stands next to one of the barracks			1
the 30 - minute film produced was entitled @entity40 ( under the cloak ) considering the conditions and the basic equipment the quality of the footage is quite remarkable			1
the cameramen would become so bold they even filmed the guards tearing their barracks apart in a surprise search			2
but perhaps the most striking footage shows badly malnourished prisoners digging their own escape tunnel			1
lt @entity58 who has been presented with @entity15 's highest award - the legion d'honneur , recalled the escape attempt			1
he said : ' in the early days we tried digging a number of tunnels from the huts in which we were barracked			2
' it was viewed as a form of resistance			2
the @entity19 seemed to accept it , though it never worked			2
the distances to the wire were too great			0
and in any case the guards were clever			0
they always found the tunnels we started			0
they were looking for the earth we 'd removed			0
' brazen : a @entity19 guard is filmed walking past one of the barracks in total the prisoners of @entity60 dug 32 tunnels			1
most were discovered by the guards but one attempt did prove successful			0
the @entity19 had permitted the prisoners to build a theatre which they decorated with branches to obscure the view of the guards			1
situated between the barracks and the wire it meant the distance they had to dig was far shorter			0
in addition the prisoners had been issued with shovels to dig their own air raid trenches folowing a complaint fromn the @entity172			1
using these valuable tools they braved suffocating conditions to burrow 90m underneath the perimeter and on september 17 1943 they were ready to go			0
over two nights , 132 men slipped out into the darkness			0
they had been provided with civilian clothes and forged papers			0
each had been ordered to travel in different directions to reduce the possibility of capture			0
gruelling : a @entity15 pow is seen inside the tunnel through which 132 prisoners made their escape			1
only two managed to make it back to @entity15 lt @entity58 recalled : ' the short length of the tunnel and the number of people inside , meant we had to lie in the foetal position			0
' there was so little air			0
some of the men fainted			0
we waited almost 10 hours to go , all the time imagining the worst ; the @entity19 firing squad that would surely be waiting at the end of the tunnel			0
' but getting onto the other side of the perimeter was just the first step and finding themselves deep in enemy territory hundreds of miles from @entity15 , the odds were stacked against them			0
of the 132 who broke out , 126 were recaptured within the first week			0
only @entity212 and one other prisoner managed to return to @entity15			0
the story of @entity212 - @entity58 's escape sounds like the plot to a @entity218 film			1
after making his way to @entity220 , he worked as a hospital nurse treating @entity19 soldiers for venereal disease			0
after securing a weekend pass to @entity52 he travelled by train with @entity19 officers			0
his work treating their embarrassing problems must have held him in good stead as one even offered to drive him home in a @entity19 army staff car			1
but @entity212 - @entity58 's loyalty was never in doubt and within weeks he had joined the resistance .			2
