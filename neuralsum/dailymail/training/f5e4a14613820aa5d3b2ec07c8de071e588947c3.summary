having a general anaesthetic before an operation can cause long - term memory loss because the drugs used may trigger a persistent reaction in the brain			1
a new @entity7 study suggests memory cells which should be blocked as a temporary measure to facilitate surgery may never recover			1
until now , scientists have not understood why about a third of patients who undergo anaesthesia and surgery experience some kind of cognitive impairment - including confusion and poor brain functioning - during the days following the operation			1
having a general anaesthetic before an operation can cause long - term memory loss because the drugs used may trigger a persistent reaction in the brain , claim researchers ( file picture ) post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( @entity28 ) after a general anaesthetic is a short - lived phenomenon for most , although recent research suggests some @entity28 sufferers have a higher risk of developing dementia			1
however , one - tenth of patients still suffer cognitive impairments three months later and many relatives complain their loved ones were ‘ never quite the same ’ after a major operation			2
previous experimental studies suggest some anaesthetic drugs can promote inflammation of brain tissue in a way that is characteristic of dementia			2
another theory is that insufficient oxygen to the brain may have an effect in vulnerable patients			2
but the latest study suggests another mechanism involving memory - loss receptors in the brain , which are activated by anaesthetic drugs to ensure patients do n’t remember traumatic events during surgery			1
professor @entity58 and her team at the @entity61 ’s @entity60 found the activity of memory loss receptors remains high long after the drugs have been eliminated from the patient ’s body			1
animal studies showed this chain reaction has long - term effects on the performance of memory - related tasks			1
professor @entity58 , an anaesthesiologist at @entity74 , said : ‘ patients - and even many doctors - think anaesthetics do n’t have long - term consequences			1
a third of patients who undergo anaesthesia experience some cognitive impairment - including confusion and poor brain function - following an operation ‘ our research shows that our fundamental assumption about how these drugs work is wrong			1
’ in the study led by researcher @entity92 the team gave healthy male mice a low dose of anaesthetic for just 20 minutes			0
the results showed receptor activity remained at higher levels a week later , even when memory performance had been restored in the animals			0
the findings suggest a ‘ previously unrecognised long - term effect ’ on the memory loss receptors			1
there appear to be compensatory changes in the brain that can circumvent the problem , according to a report published in the @entity109			0
the team is now looking at drugs that can stop the continuing impact on the receptors and restore memory loss			1
while they are still in the early stages of research , some of the drugs show very promising results in animal studies , it is claimed			0
however , professor @entity58 said the results suggest a patient ’s learning and memory can be severely impaired during a time when they are receiving critical information about their care			0
post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( @entity28 ) after a general anaesthetic is a short - lived phenomenon for most , although recent research suggests some @entity28 sufferers have a higher risk of developing dementia			1
( @entity136 , brain scans of an @entity139 's patient ) ‘ there ’s a lot going on after surgery , which can alter our ability to think clearly			0
loss of sleep , new environments and medications can all impact a patient ’s mental function			0
anaesthetics likely compound these issues , ’ said professor @entity58			0
she recommends doctors and family members carefully monitor patients after surgery for any signs of memory loss			2
she said : ‘ patients should write everything down or have a second pair of ears with them after surgery			0
' for high - risk groups , physicians need to inform patients about these possible side effects and help manage the impact on recovery and overall health			2
’ the likelihood of a patient experiencing cognitive impairment depends on their age , health , type of surgery and the anaesthetic , with chances increasing for more intricate procedures			2
the incidence is highest in the elderly or those undergoing major surgery such as cardiopulmonary bypass			0
prof @entity58 warned : ‘ @entity184 do n’t put you to sleep - they induce a pharmacological coma			0
we should n’t take these drugs lightly			0

@entity7 study found a general anaesthetic can cause long - term memory loss because drugs trigger a persistent reaction in the brain
third of patients who undergo anaesthesia experience some cognitive impairment including confusion and poor brain function following an op
post-operative cognitive dysfunction is short - lived for most but sufferers have a higher risk of developing dementia
