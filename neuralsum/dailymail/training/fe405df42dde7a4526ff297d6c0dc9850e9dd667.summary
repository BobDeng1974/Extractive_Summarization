by @entity0 published : 15:22 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 27 february 2013 slip up : commons speaker @entity1 at an event as ' openly gay ' last night weighing 16 stone and standing 6ft 2ins tall , former @entity3 rugby star @entity2 is not someone you would want to offend			1
so luckily the happily married father - of - two took it in good spirits when commons speaker @entity1 mistakenly introduced him as ‘ openly gay ’ last night			2
the mp was introducing the @entity13 rugby international to a room full of guests at @entity16 , @entity18 ’s gay staff network , when he made the slip - up			1
mr @entity1 was left squirming while the audience burst into laughter and mr @entity2 called out : ‘ do n’t tell my wife ! ’ since retiring from professional rugby in 2011 , mr @entity2 , 34 , has dedicated much of his time to tackling the problem of homophobic bullying among young people through his @entity28			1
keen to press home the rugby star ’s credentials , mr @entity1 announced : ‘ i have n’t had the pleasure of meeting @entity2 before but i ’m delighted to remedy that serious deficit			1
‘ for those of you who are n’t aware his background is as a rugby international - capped no fewer than 57 times for his country - and he is openly gay and has dedicated himself to fighting for gay rights			2
’ as the audience roared with laughter mr @entity2 called out : ‘ do n’t tell my wife ! ’ mr @entity1 was left squirming and tried to backtrack			1
couple : @entity2 and his wife @entity45 seen during the @entity46 in @entity47 in 2003 ‘ no he ’s not openly gay , ’ he said , adding : ‘ i am not in favour of outing people against their will and that was an ignorant outing that i apologise to @entity0 for			2
i ’m not sure how i ’m going to be getting back from this faux pas ! ’ the mp later told reporters : ‘ that was embarrassing - but he took it in good humour			0
’ mr @entity2 - who has five - year - old twin daughters , @entity59 and @entity60 , with his wife @entity45 - was obviously not fazed by mr @entity1 ’s blunder			1
writing on his @entity64 page afterwards , he said it was a ‘ great honour ’ to speak to the group and even posted a picture of himself with mr @entity1 at the meeting			0
former star : @entity2 ( left ) , the @entity3 wing is ankle tapped by @entity72 ( right ) of @entity73 during a @entity75 match in october 2003 in @entity47 but not everyone was so forgiving , with followers speculating that mr @entity1 may have mistaken the rugby star with @entity79 , the openly gay founder of @entity80			1
' for those of you who are n’t aware his background is as a rugby international - capped no fewer than 57 times for his country - and he is openly gay and has dedicated himself to fighting for gay rights ' commons speaker @entity1 's slip - up one follower posted : ‘ bit of a faux pas of @entity93 to out you as being “ openly gay ” , the silly old tart could have been more precise between @entity0 and @entity79 ! hope the missus gets the right man back home ! ’ perhaps mr @entity1 was not the first to have made the mistake			1
mr @entity2 is considered a gay icon , has posed for the cover of gay magazines and in 2008 was named @entity103 ’s sports personality of the year			0
talking of his gay following in 2011 he said : ‘ to be honest with you it ’s something that ’s been going on for about five or six years			0
i do n’t really see myself as a gay icon , but i realise i have this huge following and it ’s growing every day			0
