a review into social media and its role in children 's suicides ' glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours ' a recent study has shown			1
the @entity8 in @entity9 , concerned at suicide rates amongst @entity12 youngsters , released some of the 140 submissions they have made on sunday night , exploring the way social media plays a part			1
one child a week commits suicide , with another 50 - 60 admitted to hospital for self - harming - and boys are twice as likely to end their own lives than girls , writes the @entity12			1
more and more @entity12 youngsters are exposed to suicide via the internet and socia media , sparking some copycat cases says a new submission by the @entity8 in @entity9 the submission report , spear - headed by @entity31 , the @entity32 says that several have killed themselves after looking up instructions on the internet			1
but even more worrying , some of the 140 submissions that were released on sunday show that youngsters can be drawn into the social leverage and immortalisation it gives them			1
there is proof that one teenager chose to end her life after seeing the outpouring of grief another youngster had received online after killing herself , with one user 's condolence message attracting 190 likes			0
the submission says : ' it can be interpreted that there is clearly a social status in not only knowing a suicide occurred but even more so in contributing and participating in the shared grief			2
there is a social reward for this behaviour			2
' because the internet and sms has replaced the traditional way in which children and teenagers communicate , access to suicide is instantaneous and un-policed			2
' the fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death , ' says the submission more than 2000 young people have signed up to websites set up in memory of recent youngsters who committed suicide in @entity9 , even though the majority did n't even know the troubled teenagers			1
that figure is five times the number of people who would usually be exposed to suicide in the community			2
' the instant outpouring of grief and love means that ' young people are actively engaging in activities that expose them to youth suicide , such as seeking out suicide tribute pages online , ' says the submission			0
' the fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death			0
' a quick @entity94 search flags up pro-suicide websites and the report clearly states , ' there are pro-suicide forums with content that glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours '			0
' the fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death , ' says the submission according to the @entity106 there were 18,277 hospitalisations for young people intentional self - harming between the ages of 3 and 17 in 2007 and 2013			0
and 333 youngsters between the ages of four and 17 died from their injuries which were cause by self - harming between 2007 - 2012			0
alarmingly the report also found that of the 187 @entity9 children and youngsters who have committed suicide , one third knew someone who had done it before them			1
the @entity32 is demanding the government to do more on a national level to raise awareness and train those who are in a position to spot the risks and warning signs before it 's too late			0
if you are suicidal , self - harming , depressed or need someone to talk to contact @entity133 or @entity134 or dial them on 1 800 55 1800 .			0
