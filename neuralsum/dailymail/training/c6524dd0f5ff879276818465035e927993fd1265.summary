by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 17:22 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 17:22 est , 6 november 2012 sales of new cars to private buyers soared by nearly a quarter last month in a ' resilient ' market – pushing overall sales up by 12 per cent , official figures reveal today			1
but there is strong evidence of motorists and families ' down - sizing ' from bigger cars to smaller , more frugal , fuel - efficient and environmentally vehicles – with the @entity17 ' super-mini ' the biggest seller			1
it means new car sales for the year are now on course to burst through the 2 million mark – higher than previously expects , said the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
the @entity17 was the top selling car for october this year @entity23 : cars such as the @entity23 have become popular as householders downsize people 's car : the @entity28 continues to be a strong performer in motor sales the influx of household consumers ' cash in particular into the motor industry gave an encouraging boost of confidence and glimmer of hope amid the economic gloom			1
a total of 151,252 cars were registered in october 2012 - a 12.1per cent rise on the october 2011 figure			2
but private sales last month rose by almost 24per cent – with households buying 68,191 cars compared to 55,043 last october			1
sales of alternatively - fuelled ' green ' vehicles soared almost 39per cent – but still remain relatively low at 2,206			1
the private - sale boom took the year - to - date total sales figure to 1,771,861 - a 5per cent rise on the january - october 2011 total			1
as a result of the private - buyer boost , the @entity21 has revised upwards its forecast for full - year sales to more than two million vehicles - compared with 1.94 million in 2011			1
however , the year - to - date figure for 2012 is still some 16per cent - or 335,000 vehicles - below the 2007 pre-recession volume			2
the @entity21 report said : ' against a backdrop of weak @entity68 demand for cars the @entity65 market has proved remarkably resilient			0
@entity79 ' it has increased in every month this year , apart from february , which is traditionally a low - volume month			2
' the growth in 2012 reflects an improvement in private demand , while fleet demand has sustained the volumes recovered in 2011			0
' it adds : ' demand for small cars has risen rapidly , in part due to new models			0
' the ' @entity94 ' segment has grown by 52.0 per cent over the year - to - date and the @entity96 segment by 5.8 per cent			0
collectively these two segments account for close to 40per cent of the market			0
the @entity17 – which falls into the ' super-mini ' category – was the best - selling new car in october and the year - to - date			2
the report adds : ' the @entity21 has revised up its full year 2012 forecast to 2.013 million units from 1.97 million forecast in july and 1.92 million at the start of the year			2
the iconic @entity94 remains one of the top ten small cars in the @entity65 compact style : @entity110 is at the high end of the ' super-mini ' cars ' the market is forecast to be stable in 2013 at 2.015 million units			0
' @entity21 chief executive @entity116 said : ' despite uncertainty in the @entity68 economy , the @entity65 new car market continues to grow			0
' it is encouraging to see the alternatively - fuelled vehicle market performing strongly			0
' although this sector represents only a small share of the overall market , it is vital that the government sustains its consumer incentive programme and maximises the benefits available through the vehicle taxation system			0
