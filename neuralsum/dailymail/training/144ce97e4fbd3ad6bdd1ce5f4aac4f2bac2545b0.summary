by @entity0 there is not yet an identikit for the next @entity4 manager			1
chief executive @entity5 has pledged that the board will both take their time and use open minds when it comes to selecting @entity11 's replacement			1
in the impressive figure of @entity14 , however , there is a candidate who might well match many of the criteria that could be considered			1
former @entity4 player ? check			1
@entity18 and ambitious ? check			2
experience at the top level of the game ? check			2
out of work and available ? check			2
interest : it is thought that @entity14 would be willing to speak to @entity4 about their vacancy it is thought that @entity14 would be willing to speak to the @entity27 club about their vacancy			1
but he also remains a man in demand south of the border			2
his name is currently being considered in the boardroom at @entity32			2
tempting him to continue his career in the more constrained @entity35 environment may not be entirely straightforward			2
one man who has worked closely with @entity14 throughout his management career to date is adamant , though , that it would be worth every ounce of effort			1
@entity42 midfielder @entity41 played under the 42 - year - old at both @entity44 and @entity45 and has no doubt @entity14 would thrive if handed the reins at @entity4			1
' i think @entity49 ticks a lot of boxes , ' @entity41 told @entity52			1
' he is an @entity53 player so the fans will be fully aware of him â€“ and he understands the club			1
' he is still young in management terms and has done very well in his career so far			2
' i 'm sure he is desperate to get back in quickly			2
the @entity4 job would probably suit him perfectly			1
he is available and i can see no reason why he is not the man for it			2
' @entity14 's time at @entity45 came to a controversial end when a breakdown in his relationship with owner @entity66 led to a well - trailed sacking last december			1
even by the modern standards of the @entity71 game , it was a development which led to an outpouring of sympathy for the @entity74			2
he had led @entity45 into the top flight for the first time in 53 years and left them sitting one point above the relegation zone			1
the @entity81 club eventually finished bottom of the @entity83 , six points short of safety			1
his dismissal did not , therefore , do any significant damage to a reputation that has grown since he took charge of @entity44 back in 2009			2
former @entity90 man @entity41 was there from the start			1
' when i first went to @entity44 , he was a coach under @entity95 at the time , ' the 31 - year - old recalled			2
' but i could see he was ready to do more than he was doing			2
' @entity95 was very much a hands - on manager and took a lot of the training			0
@entity49 had to bide his time for a number of months and it took @entity95 leaving for @entity103 for him to get the opportunity to take the @entity44 job			0
he grabbed it with both hands			0
' @entity49 is not that long out of the changing room			0
he knows how players feel and how they want to be treated			0
' you know that you can have a laugh with him but , at the same time , you are very aware you do n't want to cross the line			0
his door is always open if you want to have a chat			0
but he will soon let you know if your standards have dropped or if he thinks you are not putting the effort in			0
interest : @entity41 is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at @entity45 ' he did very well at @entity44 with a not very big budget at all			1
he then got the move to @entity45 and a team that had fallen short at the last hurdle on a number of occasions			1
' @entity49 was the man picked to get them into the @entity83 and that 's exactly what he did in his second year			0
' he had done it a few times as a player and knew exactly what it took to get over the line			0
his first year was about transition and building the squad			0
but we managed to get the job done in the second year and that was a great achievement			0
' @entity14 's profile rose in accordance with @entity45 's success , yet the spotlight he would face at @entity4 would be of substantially greater wattage			1
the environment in @entity147 can be stifling for those in the lead roles			0
it is a situation that requires a certain type of character			0
again , though , @entity41 believes @entity14 has what it takes			1
' i know being a manager of the one of the @entity158 clubs is n't easy , ' he recognised			0
' it 's not just back page stuff , you are on the front page as well			0
' there is huge scrutiny on you and the passion from the fans is incredible			0
you are in the public eye all the time			0
' but i think @entity49 has shown he can handle that kind of situation			0
it 's not something that 's great to talk about but the scenario at @entity45 with the owner was n't ideal			1
' but @entity49 conducted himself in a certain manner and was still willing to put himself out to the media			0
on the dressing room side , i could see how well he was handling it			0
he did n't allow the players to get caught up in it or for it to be used as any kind of excuse			0
' he keeps all external stuff away from his players and i 'm fairly confident he could handle anything that is thrown at him should he end up at @entity4			1
' @entity41 is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at @entity45 amid reported interest from @entity189			1
wherever he ends up next , he will never forget the influence @entity14 has had on him			1
' my @entity44 contract was out at the same time as he took the @entity45 job , ' @entity41 said			1
' he asked me to come and join him again and i was confident @entity49 was the person who could get that club promotion			1
' we did just that and i managed to play in the @entity83			0
i also added ten @entity42 caps while working under him			0
so he has been a great help to my career and i will always be in debt to him			0
