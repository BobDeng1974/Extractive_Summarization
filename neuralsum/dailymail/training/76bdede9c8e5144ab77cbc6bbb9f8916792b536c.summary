there is every chance that most people will hate it , but this @entity3 will see the launch of a @entity6 chocolate egg			1
the egg is being launched alongside an equally unlikely @entity9 version by food giant @entity10 , which argues they will ‘ broaden the appeal of @entity3 ’			1
the idea of mixing the savoury and salty taste of @entity6 with the sweetness of chocolate is not the first flavour combination that would spring to mind – even for the likes of chemistry set chefs like @entity21			1
the sticky dark brown paste has been a staple of the @entity40 diet since it was first produced in @entity41 , @entity42 , in 1902			0
but while it has survived a long time , it triggers very strong feelings of love and loathing			0
while a distinctly @entity40 product , the name came from the @entity51 word to describe a large , covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. it was originally made from yeast supplied by the @entity58 brewery and became so popular that a second factory was opened in @entity60 , @entity61 , in 1907			0
in the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in b vitamins and was issued to @entity40 troops in @entity67 as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi , which left them feeling weak and sick			0
bosses at @entity10 hope they will not be left with egg on their face after the @entity3 treat 's release today , it is the nation ’s second best - selling spread behind @entity81 honey , which took the top spot in 2013			1
@entity10 has formed a partnership with the confectionary firm @entity84 to deliver the chocolate egg which carries hints of @entity6 and is promoted under the slogan ‘ love it or hate it ’			1
the firm ’s @entity40 head of licensing @entity90 said : ‘ building on the success of our first ever @entity92 last year with iconic ice cream brands @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , we wanted to bring something new to the easter egg market once again for 2015			0
‘ by broadening the appeal of the easter egg fixture , we anticipate that the new additions will drive sales for retailers by offering an exciting new product from brands that consumers know and love			0
’ the firm is hoping to tap into a growing easter egg market that is now worth £ 365million in the @entity40 every single year			0
the product will sit on the shelves next to a specially created @entity112 , news that is set to delight chocolate loving students up and down the country			2
@entity6 will be launched in a shell egg format , which saw an 18 per cent annual growth last year , and @entity9 will launch in mug and egg format , which has seen growth of 13 per cent			1
competitors : the @entity9 and @entity6 eggs face egg - cellent competition from @entity124 's , @entity125 and @entity126 one manufacturer , @entity127 & @entity128 , has been selling a @entity6 flavoured milk chocolate bar , which contains two per cent of the spread , for five years			1
it has received some positive reviews as ‘ suprisingly nice ’ and a rating of 4.2 out of five on @entity135 , however some complained that the @entity6 taste was not powerful enough			2
@entity138 ’s @entity137 said : ‘ @entity3 is n’t just for kids			2
we want to bring fun to @entity3 fixtures by using these two iconic brands			0
‘ the @entity144 , which shoppers will either love or hate , combines @entity6 with chocolate			2
’ the two eggs , which go on sale in february , will each cost £ 5 .			1

@entity6 and @entity9 are both launching chocolate @entity3 eggs
@entity10 , which owns both products , says it will ' broaden appeal of @entity3 '
both eggs hit the shelves next week and will cost £ 5 in *supermarkets*
