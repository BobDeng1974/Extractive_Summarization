shocking figures revealed today that one in 15 people in @entity2 is now living in poverty			1
the number - a record high - is spread widely across metropolitan areas as the country 's economic troubles continue to bite			2
and almost 15 per cent of the population are also now on food stamps , it emerged yesterday			1
the ranks of the poor applying for food stamps increased by a worrying 8.1 per cent over the past year to make a total of 45.8 million			2
hand out nation : @entity2 's economic troubles are continuing to bite with almost 15 % of the @entity2 population now on food stamps the increase in poverty is believed to have been caused due to the housing bust pushing many inner - city poor into suburbs and other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income			1
' there now really is no unaffected group , except maybe the very top income earners , ' said @entity30 , a professor of economics at @entity32			2
' recessions are supposed to be temporary , and when it 's over , everything returns to where it was before			2
but the worry now is that the downturn — which will end eventually — will have long - lasting effects on families who lose jobs , become worse off and ca n't recover			2
' @entity42 : the ranks of the poor applying for food stamps increased by a worrying 8.1 % over the past year to make a total of 45.8 million ( stock photo ) split societies : the top ten cities where there is the greatest divide between rich and poor once - booming @entity52 metro areas are now seeing some of the biggest jumps in concentrated poverty			1
@entity55 21.5 % 2 @entity56 20.7 % 3 @entity57 20.6 % 4 @entity58 20.2 % 5 @entity59 19.9 % about 20.5 million @entity2 , or 6.7 per cent of the @entity2 population , make up the poorest poor , defined as those at 50 per cent or less of the official poverty level			1
those living in deep poverty represent nearly half of the 46.2 million people scraping by below the poverty line			1
in 2010 , the poorest poor meant an income of $ 5,570 or less for an individual and $ 11,157 for a family of four			2
that 6.7 percent share is the highest in the 35 years that the @entity72 has maintained such records , surpassing previous highs in 2009 and 1993 of just over 6 percent			2
after declining during the 1990s economic boom , the proportion of poor people in large metropolitan areas who lived in high - poverty neighborhoods jumped from 11.2 per cent in 2000 to 15.1 per cent last year , according to a @entity82 analysis released on thursday			1
as a whole , the number of poor in the suburbs who lived in high - poverty neighborhoods rose by 41 per cent since 2000 , more than double the growth of such city neighborhoods			1
graph : suburban households are less likely to receive @entity93 benefits , but usage is on the rise with about nine per cent of households poverty for @entity2 65 and older is on track to nearly double after factoring in rising out - of - pocket medical expenses , from nine per cent to more than 15 per cent			1
poverty increases are also anticipated for the working - age population because of commuting and child - care costs , while child poverty will dip partly due to the positive effect of food stamps			1
the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest in five weeks , government data showed on thursday , in a hopeful sign for the struggling job market			1
initial jobless claims totalled 397,000 in the week ending october 29 , down from a revised 406,000 claims the previous week , the @entity112 reported			1
the claims number was lower than the average analyst estimate of 401,000 , and provided a positive reading on the depressed job market ahead of friday 's october jobs data			1
it was the third time in six months that weekly initial jobless claims have fallen below 400,000			1
last week 's reading was the lowest since september 24 , when claims stood at 395,000			1
but applications need to fall consistently below 375,000 to signal sustainable job growth			2
they have n't been below that level since february			0
applications have been above 400,000 for all but two weeks since march			0
the figures come a day before the government releases its october jobs report			0
analysts expect employers added 100,000 net jobs , nearly the same as the 103,000 added in september			0
the unemployment rate is expected to stay at 9.1 per cent for a fourth straight month			1
employers have added an average of only 72,000 jobs per month in the past five months			0
that 's far below the 100,000 per month needed to keep up with population growth			0
and it 's down from an average of 180,000 in the first four months of this year			0
and with one in 15 in poverty , more than one in four of working age are now tapping food stamps			1
according to @entity149 figures , worst hit were people in @entity55 , where more than 21 per cent were recipients			1
one in five residents in @entity58 , @entity57 , @entity56 and @entity59 also depended on the hand outs - formally known as the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) - to eat			1
officials fear the numbers may swell even more in the coming months as people battle financial hardship and record unemployment			1
but one reason for the rising number of recipients was that many states have waived requirements limiting the assets food stamp applicants could own , said the @entity166			2
the number of food stamp users exploded after the recession hit in late 2007 and has continued growing even though the downtown is officially supposed to be over			2
researchers from the @entity172 at the @entity173 estimated that the percentage of @entity2 receiving food stamps increased by 61.2 per cent between 2007 and 2010			0
@entity176 on the @entity177 was very high among single parents , rising ten per cent			0
in 2010 , 42 per cent of single mothers and 25 per cent of single fathers relied on the stamps			0
in rural areas it was ever higher at one in two single mothers			0
@entity185 also made changes to make it easier for residents to tap into the program , such as waiving requirements that limited the value of assets food stamp recipients could own			0
this is believed to have been caused due to the housing bust pushing many inner - city poor into suburbs and other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income			0
' there now really is no unaffected group , except maybe the very top income earners , ' said @entity30 , a professor of economics at @entity32			0
' recessions are supposed to be temporary , and when it 's over , everything returns to where it was before			0
but the worry now is that the downturn — which will end eventually — will have long - lasting effects on families who lose jobs , become worse off and ca n't recover			0
' the institute also found that 14.6 per cent of rural households were relying on the @entity216 in 2010			0
suburban households are less likely to receive @entity93 benefits , but usage is on the rise			0
about nine per cent of suburban households received @entity93 in 2010 , up from 5.4 pe rcent in 2007			0
@entity223 , a vulnerable families research associate with the @entity172 , said she thinks rural residents have traditionally been less likely to collect @entity93 benefits because they live in remote areas where it ’s hard to access social services and are more concerned with the social stigma			0
in a rural area , she said : ' when you go into the grocery store and you pull out your food stamps card , everybody knows you			0
' just one in ten married couples with children are using the government - funded food benefit .			2

worst hit states are @entity55 , @entity58 , @entity57 , @entity56 and @entity59
one in 15 people now living in poverty
but unemployment benefit claims down for third week in a row
