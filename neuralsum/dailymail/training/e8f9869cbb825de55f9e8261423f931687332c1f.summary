@entity0 hopes to agree a new deal with @entity2 this season even though his current contract still has more than a year to run			1
' i am sure something will happen this year , ' the 2008 world champion told @entity8 reporters at the @entity10 @entity9 on thursday			1
' but now is not the time to really focus on that			0
' i 've made it clear to them that they do n't have to worry , i 'm not out seeing what else there is for me			0
@entity2 has been my family since i started @entity18 so i do n't see that changing any time soon			1
' settled : @entity0 is happy to extend his @entity2 contract but is n't in a hurry competitive rivalry : @entity0 and @entity2 team - mate are in a fierce fight for the @entity25 ' championship @entity0 has won five of the 10 races so far this year but is still 14 points behind @entity30 team - mate @entity29 , who has four wins to his credit , ahead of sunday 's race			1
@entity29 signed a new multi-year contract with the @entity8 - based team last week , ahead of his home @entity9 at @entity37			1
a new deal , if of the same three - year duration as the last , would be worth tens of millions			2
estimates have put @entity0 's current salary at around Â£ 20 million a year			1
healthy : @entity0 maintains his relationship with @entity2 chief @entity44 is a good one ' i 've made no secret to both ( technical director ) @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and ( @entity2 motorsport head ) @entity48 ( @entity52 ) - we have a very good , open relationship - and i 've said " you will be the first to know if i was ever to speak to anyone else " , ' he said			1
' but i 've said " there would n't be because i want to be speaking to you "			0
we spoke about having a chat at some stage but i think they 're quite relaxed as well , as far as i 'm aware			0
' i 've shown an interest in sitting down and talking			0
we have n't sat down yet , but the team know i 'd like to push to continue , and they have made clear they would like to do the same , ' said @entity0			2
the driver started his career with @entity2 - powered @entity66 in 2007 and has been backed by the @entity30 manufacturer since he was 13 - years - old			2
he joined the @entity2 team in 2013 and the heavily tattooed driver said he felt like he had " mercedes imprinted on my chest "			2
not interested : @entity0 did n't entertain speculation that @entity2 could sign @entity73 the 29 - year - old dismissed with a shrug speculation that @entity2 were also interested in signing four - times world champion @entity73 , who has been having a difficult season , from @entity76			1
' i am not concerned about that , ' he said			0
' ultimately if the team wanted him in the car , that 's their decision			2
i do n't have any feelings about it			0
there will always be a place for every driver and what will be , will be			2
' but i feel like i 'm very much part of the family here			0
i 'm not knocking on @entity48 's door or @entity49 's to get something done because i have faith in them and i think hopefully they have faith in me			0
' i would wish to continue with them and i think they hopefully want to do the same with me			0
' @entity0 is a favourite to win in @entity99 , having done so for the last two years and four times in total			1
another win would break the record he currently shares with @entity104			0
high - flier : @entity0 is favourite to win in @entity99 and reduce @entity29 's lead in the @entity25 ' championship testing : a crash during qualifying cost @entity0 in @entity30 and handed @entity29 a clear advantage			1

@entity0 *adamant* he is happy to sign new deal with @entity2
@entity8 driver has more than a year to run on current contract
@entity0 is *battling* with team - mate @entity29 for the @entity18 title
2008 world champion is favourite to come out on top in @entity99
