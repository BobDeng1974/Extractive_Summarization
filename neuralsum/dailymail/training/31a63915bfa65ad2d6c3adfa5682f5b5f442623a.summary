by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 6 december 2012 the number of patients facing waiting times of more than four hours in @entity5 's accident and emergency units has reached an eight - year peak			1
the proportion of people facing the lengthy wait for treatment has increased by more than a quarter , reaching its highest level since 2004 , according to @entity14 performance data			0
the @entity16 report showed that 4.2 per cent of @entity18 patients waited longer than four hours from january to march , compared with 3.4 per cent in the same period last year			1
@entity14 report : the number of patients facing waiting times of more than four hours in @entity5 's accident and emergency units has reached an eight - year peak its authors said the increase was a cause for concern and reflected growing pressures on the hospital sector			1
on a national level , the government ’s target that no more than 5 per cent of patients face more than a four - hour wait in @entity18 was met last year , the think - tank ’s quarterly monitoring report found			1
but 48 @entity14 providers breached the threshold in the final quarter of last year compared with 18 in the second quarter			1
the @entity16 said the rise coincides with emerging evidence of increases in ' trolley waits ' as some hospitals struggle to find beds for patients			2
@entity45 obtained from 60 @entity14 finance directors as part of the study also revealed that 40 per cent of trusts did not meet their productivity targets in 2011/12			0
the report said : ' this will be a significant concern as last year was the first in a four - year spending squeeze , during which the @entity14 needs to find £ 20 billion in productivity improvements			2
' health secretary @entity57 disputed the report 's findings just four of the finance chiefs questioned said their organisation was forecasting a deficit this year , backing up national figures that estimate a surplus of £ 1.5billion across the @entity14			2
the study found the @entity14 was performing well against a number of other key indicators including hospital treatment waiting times and superbug infections			0
the proportion of inpatients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment fell , while outpatient waits remained static , the report said			0
@entity76 and @entity77 infections dropped by 33 per cent and 14 per cent respectively			0
@entity78 , chief economist at the @entity16 , said : ' overall , the @entity14 continues to perform well , despite the spending squeeze			0
however , this masks growing pressures in hospitals and significant performance issues in some @entity14 organisations			1
' given the strength of the political commitment to keep waiting times low , the steep rise in @entity18 waits will be a concern for the government			2
' the productivity challenge will only get harder , so evidence that large numbers of @entity14 organisations failed to meet their productivity targets last year does not bode well			0
' health secretary @entity57 said : ' @entity16 report is wrong to suggest the proportion of people " waiting " more than four hours to be seen in @entity18 is growing			1
' this measure records the total time people spend in the department , including the time they are being treated ; it does not just measure waiting			0
' people are waiting on average only 49 minutes for their treatment to start			0
in addition , the @entity14 has continued to meet or exceed the target of 95 per cent of patients spending a total time of four hours or less in @entity18			1
