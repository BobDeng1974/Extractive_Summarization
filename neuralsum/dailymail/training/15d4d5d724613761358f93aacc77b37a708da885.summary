a @entity1 lawyer is suing his local @entity3 bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home			2
@entity8 , 34 , accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business			1

@entity1 lawyer , @entity8 , 34 , left , is suing his local @entity3 bishop , @entity22 , right , and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home the case alleging ' religious malpractice ' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a @entity1 court			1
the four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons , according to the legal papers that named bishop @entity22 , even though he had not been to the property , as he was in charge of the priests who had been there			0
the case has already been rejected by a lower court in @entity1 and was rejected again this week by the @entity1 @entity37 , but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the @entity39			2
unusual case : the court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling he told the court : ' if they ( the accused ) represent the way of @entity47 then @entity47 's ways are crooked			0
they did not remove the demons that made these bad smells as they promised to do , and i still see all sorts of demons in the form of animals , usually crows but also other such things , that are making my life miserable			2
' when i am at home they switch the tv on and off all the time , they make foul smells that give me headaches and basically roam unhindered around my house and my business			0
' eerie : the man claimed the demons turned his television on and off and said his hair - dryer was possessed the man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair - dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property			0
but the lawyer for the @entity85 from @entity20 , @entity86 , rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man 's imagination			1
the @entity1 court agreed with the church and rejected the application against @entity100 as well as priests @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 - and ordered @entity8 to pay legal costs .			1
