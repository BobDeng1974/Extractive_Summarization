by @entity0 for @entity1 the battle for survival in the seas : a plucky seal seems to be trying to distract a great white shark in an attempt to free a fellow seal in the fish 's mouth			1
in fact , the seal is using a clever survival tactic			0
by sticking close to the tail and body of the shark , the mammal is actually able to stay well clear of the shark 's gaping maw			0
often used in the wild , this impressive survival instinct is used to outmanoeuvre and eventually tire the predator into submission , making for a clean get away for the animal in danger			0
@entity41 mr @entity40 said : ' i was tracking a group of seals that had been feeding out at sea and who were returning to the @entity47			1
' they come in groups usually and they are constantly interchanging positions with each other as they travel to try to confuse any predators waiting below			1

the mammals come in groups usually and they are constantly interchanging positions with each other as they travel to try and confuse any predators waiting below ' a large great white shark about four yards long exploded through the foam high into the air , catching one of the seals as it did so ' ' they started to move through an area of thick foam in the water when suddenly a large great white shark about four yards long exploded through the foam high into the air , catching one of the seals as it did so			1
' some seals went back the way they had come , others made a break for the safety of the nearby island but one seal decided to follow the tail of the shark			2
' in the photo it looks as if it is trying to chase the shark but it is in actual fact trying to keep close to its tail and body , well away from its sharp teeth			1
' @entity96 have great speed but the seals have amazing agility , i have seen a seal have three separate battles on the way back to the island and still make it home			2
' @entity96 have great speed but the seals have amazing agility , i have seen a seal have three separate battles on the way back to the island and still make it home ' ' it was definitely a lucky escape for the rest of the group , there were about four seals altogether and anyone of them could easily have been caught			0
' when a breach happens you just have to get the camera pointed in the right direction as quick as you can and start shooting photos , then when the action is over and your heart is racing you get to see what you 've taken			0
