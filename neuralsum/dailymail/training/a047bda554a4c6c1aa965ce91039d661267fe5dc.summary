@entity0 offered reasons to suggest it wo n’t simply be another @entity3 procession in this season ’s @entity4 as they impressively beat their @entity8 rivals in the @entity9			1
goals from @entity11 and @entity12 secured victory in the curtain - raiser at @entity15 as @entity3 were bossed from start to finish			1
but how much can we really read into this result ? 12 months ago , @entity19 ’s side beat @entity3 4 - 2 on this same ground in the same competition and duly went on to finish a distant 19 points behind , as well as losing to them in the cup final			1
the team that lines up on the opening day of the @entity4 season against @entity87 at the @entity88 on friday week will be a completely different proposition			0
but this is a result for @entity0 to hold on to and their fans certainly celebrated as though the result is a good omen for the nine months to come			2
they fielded @entity46 , the top scorer in @entity96 last season who moved from @entity98 , and he troubled @entity29 with a 10th - minute effort that flew narrowly wide			0
concern : @entity3 midfielder @entity55 lies injured on the pitch during the @entity27 blow : @entity3 's @entity55 is being carried off on a stretcher after suffering a knee injury the @entity81 - winning goalkeeper was forced into action when @entity43 found space to shoot inside the box , diving to his left to deny the @entity0 man			1
with the vocal home crowd encouraged , it was n’t long before @entity0 took a deserved lead for their early pressure			1
it was a move started and finished by @entity11 , who ghosted past youngster @entity58 before playing in @entity45 down the left			0
the striker ’s effort was blocked but it came out invitingly for the @entity121 , who rattled the ball past @entity29 and into the bottom left corner			0
@entity0 continued to dictate the pace , with @entity126 surprisingly anonymous and @entity3 ’s midfield unable to gain any control			1
@entity129 forward @entity12 tested @entity29 at his near post , but the goalkeeper produced a low reaction save			2
there was plenty for @entity135 to be worried about and it got worse when @entity55 was forced off on a stretcher after landing heavily on his knee			1
setback : @entity3 striker @entity56 suffered defeat in his first game against former club gesture : @entity3 boss @entity135 tries to motivate his players during @entity27 focused : @entity0 's @entity41 , right , challenges for the ball with @entity146 's @entity126 @entity67 replaced him but the defender was unable to stem the yellow tide			1
shortly before the break , @entity29 saved well from @entity43 and @entity150 in quick succession , though both efforts were aimed straight at the @entity154 no 1			0
back on his old ground , @entity56 was well shackled but at least he was spared the ear - splittingly negative reception given to @entity69 when he came on			0
he may have delivered @entity157 the @entity81 exactly a month ago but old club loyalties die hard in these parts			0
three minutes after the midfielder ’s introduction , @entity0 scored a match - killing second goal			1
neat build - up down the right led to @entity38 swinging in a perfect cross that @entity12 headed home			2
the striker celebrated by pulling out a @entity33 mask , before he was swiftly replaced by @entity53			0
@entity3 ’s spirit faded and @entity46 , quiet for long spells , burst into life to drag wide			2
but there was no late rally from the champions and @entity0 saw out time to land the first blow of the season			0
but , even as they lifted the trophy and paraded in front of their jubilant fans , they know the struggle to catch @entity3 is only just beginning .			0

@entity186 opened the scoring for @entity0
new *signing* @entity12 *doubled* lead with header
@entity3 midfielder @entity55 *limped* off with knee injury
