@entity1 's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better			2
when @entity5 's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of @entity11 's first half equaliser , he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the @entity14 after all			1
indeed when he then saw @entity11 convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes , he may have felt his damning critique on monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for			1
but the grit , desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a @entity26 side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses @entity1 had highlighted			2
@entity31 ( left ) headed @entity26 into a seventh - minute lead , getting on the end of @entity35 's cross winger @entity31 garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond @entity38 in the @entity5 goal @entity45 wheels away after watching @entity31 nod in at the back post , as @entity42 ( left ) and @entity43 appeal for offside but @entity26 were only ahead for three minutes after @entity11 equalised for the hosts at @entity47 @entity11 drove beyond @entity48 from the edge of the box to net his seventh @entity14 goal of the season if it made for a hugely entertaining encounter , it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be			1
@entity1 walked off the pitch at half - time with his hands planted casually in his pockets , comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger			2
but when @entity64 followed @entity66 's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors , @entity5 had replaced @entity70 's spirited side in the bottom three			1
only 12 minutes remained , and even if @entity11 required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free - kick the overriding feeling in the @entity5 ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief			1
@entity11 did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat - trick at the sound of the final whistle			1
on the contrary , he looked devastated			0
both sides have some difficult games ahead but when @entity84 and @entity85 come next for @entity5 , there is plenty to concern @entity1			2
a replay of @entity26 's goals will not make pleasant viewing			2
the failure to close down @entity35 before he delivered the cross that enabled @entity31 to strike after only seven minutes			2
the failure to challenge @entity92 and so stop him scoring his first @entity14 goal			0
the failure too to respond to the threat being posed by @entity64 , who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from @entity31 before driving the ball past @entity38			1
such frailties could yet drag @entity5 down this season , and @entity1 knows it			0
' we are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result , ' he complained afterwards , and on this evidence he would appear to be right			0

@entity31 might have landed the first blow for @entity26 but the players he was probably referring to as ' the icing on the cake ' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration			1
they were attacking with great flair and finesse , with the pace of individuals like @entity110 and @entity104 and the sheer power of @entity11			0
the call for more men made @entity1 's selection of 19 - year - old @entity165 somewhat curious			0
but the teenager too was performing well			0
more than man enough for the occasion			0
as a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster , even if the warmth of the embrace between @entity1 and @entity70 before kick - off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams			1
never one to hide his feelings , @entity1 responded to @entity26 's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust			1
it was understandable really , given how meekly his defenders tried to stop @entity35 from delivering the cross @entity186 then headed home from close range			0
only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether , @entity1 throwing it to the ground after seeing @entity11 's shot take a nasty deflection off @entity113 's trailing foot and loop over @entity48			2
the drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around @entity47			2
the atmosphere was electric , the place almost erupting again when @entity165 so nearly marked his first @entity14 start with a goal			0
@entity11 delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for @entity48 to make the save at his feet			0
@entity1 's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for @entity5			0
not everyone seemed to agree , and at one stage @entity1 seemed to be placating a fan who did n't seem quite so impressed			0
but his team were playing with real verve , with @entity11 scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed , vision and courage of @entity110 as the precision of the finish			1
@entity110 was just quick enough to send @entity11 clear before being hacked down by @entity117 , and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal			0
@entity11 finished cleverly , shaping to shoot beyond @entity92 before dragging his effort back inside the @entity26 defender and beyond the reach of a wrong - footed @entity48			1
@entity120 salutes the travelling @entity26 supporters inside @entity47 but they were n't able to cling on to the points but @entity11 's wonder free - kick , much like @entity233 's on monday night , meant @entity5 came away with a point benteke ca n't conceal his delight at completing his hat - trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute good friends @entity70 ( left ) and @entity1 know each other well and were going head - to - head in the dugout for the first time former @entity5 striker @entity243 could n't hit his elation in the press box after @entity11 knocked in his second of the goal @entity1 urges the supporters packed inside @entity47 to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble @entity64 vies for possession with @entity106 during an intense and entertaining first half @entity118 attempts to get @entity26 back in the game but could n't steer his effort beyond the @entity255 @entity47 looked a picture on tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head - to - head in @entity259 @entity1 said @entity70 was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here			1
he had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions			0
it had the desired effect , @entity92 equalising four minutes later ; punishment for what appeared to be @entity104 's failure to stay with his man			1
@entity64 's goal â€“ his 17th in the @entity14 this season - would be a further source of concern , even if @entity11 did then level for a second time with a wonderful free - kick that beat @entity48 via the inside of a post			1
are they man enough ? only time will tell .			0

@entity31 gave @entity26 a seventh - minute lead in the *crunch* clash at @entity47
but that lead only lasted three minutes , with @entity11 equalising for the hosts
@entity11 then added a second after 33 minutes to nudge @entity5 ahead in the relegation scrap
@entity92 was the unlikely man to level the scores after the break for @entity70 's side
@entity64 looked to have scored a late winner in an entertaining game on tuesday night
but @entity11 completed his hat - trick to earn a share of the spoils on 83 minutes
