by @entity0 @entity1 has begun making the first @entity3 printed house that can simply be slotted together on site from giant plastic ' bricks '			1
dubbed the ' @entity8 ' , the project is designed to look like one of the tall , narrow brick houses common in @entity1			1
the team plan to constantly improve the house as technology advances to show building firms what can be achieved			0

a visitor passes a 3d printer , rear , as she looks at part of the ' @entity23 ' in @entity1 at the core of the project is a 6 - meter ( 20 - foot ) - tall printer dubbed the @entity27 , or ' room - builder			1
' it 's a scaled - up version of the open - source home 3 - d printer made by @entity31 , popular with hobbyists			2
it takes the @entity27 about a week to print each massive , unique , honeycomb - structured block , layer by layer			1
the first block , which forms one corner of the house and part of a stairway , weighed around 180 kilograms ( 400 lbs )			2
the blocks will later be filled with a foam material , still under development , that will harden like concrete to add additional weight and bind the blocks together			0
@entity50 architects fabricated pieces of the canal house out of plastic with a giant @entity3 printer and slotted them together like oversized @entity8 blocks			1
@entity57 of architect bureau @entity56 says the goal of the demonstration project launched this month is not so much to print a functioning house - in fact , parts of the house will likely be built and re-built several times over the course of three years as @entity3 printing technology develops			2
rather , it is to discover and share the potential uses of @entity3 printing in construction by creating new materials , trying out designs and testing building techniques to see what works			0
' there 's only one way to find out , ' she says			0
' she envisions a future in which personalized architecture may be custom - crafted on the spot , or perhaps selected from an online store for architectural designs , downloaded and tweaked			0

dus expects to add more printers and change designs along the way , with help from @entity50 construction company @entity120 , @entity122 chemicals manufacturer @entity121 , and anybody else who wants to participate and can make useful contributions			0
the construction site in northern @entity1 is also an exhibition , open to the public for 2.50 euros ( $ 3.00 )			2

pieces of the house printed by giant on - site printer in @entity1
each block takes a week to print
once completed , **modules** were slotted together
@entity8 can *easily* be *remodelled* by simply slotting in new **modules**
