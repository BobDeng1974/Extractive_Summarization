recruits to the armed forces will be asked whether they are gay and about their sexual preferences			1
the measure has been introduced in a bid to foster greater tolerance within the armed forces , which only allowed gay soldiers to openly serve in 2000			0
recruits can , however , choose not to make the declaration			0
there are no records kept on the number of gay recruits in the force , but the year before the ban was lifted 298 were dismissed			2
recruits to the armed forces will be asked whether they are gay and their sexual preferences ; pictured above is recruits going through basic training in @entity19 , @entity20 , in 2005 @entity21 , 28 , who suffered beatings in the @entity24 ’s @entity23 for being openly gay before being famously saved by @entity25 , welcomed the move			1
the @entity27 told the @entity28 : ‘ it ’s fantastic news			0

recruits will also be asked to provide additional information on how open they feel they can be regarding their sexual orientation			1
the information will not be visible on individual personal records or to chain of command or managers , and will be anonymised before being collated to ensure no one can be identified by their personal diversity information			1
the @entity34 believes the information will better help them understand the ' composition ' of the armed forces and help them ensure their policies and practices ' fully support our personnel ' ; pictured above , recruits are put through an exercise at the @entity63 near @entity19 in 2007 a @entity34 ( @entity34 ) spokesman said the ministry ‘ encourages diversity at all levels ’			1

the armed forces said they believe the policy will shed new light on their workforce and help create a more inclusive organisation where everyone feels values - no matter their sexuality , race , religion or gender			1
@entity89 , a charity which campaigned against the discrimination of gay soldiers , welcomed the move saying the more the @entity34 knows about personnel , the more they ‘ can support ’ them .			0
