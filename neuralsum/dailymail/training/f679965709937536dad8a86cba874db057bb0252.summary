a @entity1 man has been pulled barely alive from his snow - covered car having survived on nothing but snow for two months in sub-zero temperatures			1
@entity6 , 44 , had eaten nothing but handfuls of snow since december 19 when his car became bogged down in drifts near the town of @entity13 in northern @entity1			1
pictures of the vehicle 's interior show the dashboard and seats covered in ice after temperatures plunged to -30c			2
@entity20 effect : @entity6 somehow survived inside this icebound car for two months by eating handfuls of snow as temperatures plunged as low as -30c @entity25 conditions : this picture shows just how much ice had built up inside the vehicle			1
mr @entity6 also appears to have had food and drink supplies , albeit limited ones frozen in : the @entity1 's car was found covered in 2ft of snow after getting trapped in drifts on december 19 trapped : mr @entity6 was eventually discovered near the town of @entity13 on the north - east coast of @entity1 experts think he went into a kind of human hibernation which slowed down his metabolism and pulled him through the ordeal in what they have described as the ' case of a lifetime '			1
mr @entity6 had driven off the main road on to forest tracks where his car became stuck fast			1
on friday a passing man on a snowmobile stopped to scrape snow from the windscreen of the vehicle and saw movement inside			1
as he recovered in a hospital today details emerged of depression and debts piling up on him and it is thought he might have been trying to take his own life			2
police initially thought he was a nature lover who had become trapped in the snow while on an expedition to photograph elk			1
but now it emerges there was a court judgment against him in december because of debts totaling £ 150,000			1
neighbours of his in the town of @entity70 in central @entity1 said he had also broken up with his girlfriend and had lost contact with his father and other family members 20 years ago			1
' we now have to wait until he is better to try to find out what really was in his mind , ' said police officer @entity78			2
mr @entity6 survived by taking handfuls of snow from the roof of the car			1
the only other things found with him were cigarettes and comic books			2
some protection : mr @entity6 did at least have warm clothes and a sleeping bag with him ( left ) in his car ' absolutely incredible that he is alive , in part considering that he has n’t had any food , but also bearing in mind that it was really cold for a while there after @entity96 , ' said a member of the emergency services team deployed to rescue him			0
the case of @entity6 is so extraordinary doctors and medical experts are still trying to establish exactly how the 44 - year - old survived in such extreme circumstances			1
one theory being put forward by dr @entity105 , from @entity106 , is that mr @entity6 's metabolism may have slowed down ' like a bear that hibernates ' , making it easier to go without food			0
but @entity111 , the chief medical officer at @entity112 , said it was more likely because of the insulation provided by his vehicle			0
' it is not possible for humans to hibernate like a bear , ' he said			0
' in the car , he had very warm clothes , he had a warm sleeping bag , and as the car was snowed under , that would have made it more like an igloo			0
' he was emaciated , barely able to move and could barely speak			1
' he was at the end of his tether , ' said a police spokesman			0
' it was doubtful he could have survived one or two more days			0
' he was wrapped up in a sleeping bag in the car but he had no other warmth ; the fuel had run out long ago as he kept the heater running to try to survive as the thermometer plunged on some nights to -30c			0
pictures also show food wrappers and drink cartons , which suggests he may have had supplies with him for at least some of the time			0
mr @entity6 is recovering in the intensive care ward at @entity112 where he is being fed liquid proteins			0
he has hypothermia and is severely malnourished			0
he was never registered as missing , for which there is currently no explanation			0
policeman @entity78 added : ' he was in a very poor state when we found him			0
he could not speak , just a few broken sentences and the words snow ... eat			2
and he managed to say he had n’t eaten anything since december			2

emaciated @entity1 , 44 , discovered after living off handfuls of snow
had been stuck in drifts on remote road since december 19
experts believe he may have gone into some kind of hibernation
