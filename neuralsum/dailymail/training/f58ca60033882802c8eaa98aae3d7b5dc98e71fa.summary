her rates were $ 600 for one hour , $ 1,000 for two , $ 4,000 for 12 and $ 6,000 for 24 hours			0
her profile listed her as being 110lbs and 5 ' 4 " , and made much of her blonde hair and blue eyes			0
now , however , discretion could hardly be further from her mind after her book deal with @entity45 , an imprint of @entity47 , came to light			2
the 320 - page book , titled @entity50 : running from @entity51 , is set to hit stores in june next year			1

right , she is with her daughter speaking to @entity65 when her sideline was revealed , @entity8 , said : ' i 'm owning up to what i did			2
i would not blame anybody except myself ... everybody in this world makes mistakes			0
i made a huge mistake			0
' in a series of @entity76 posts after her escort work was disclosed , @entity8 said that the paid encounters provided ' coping mechanisms ' and ' escape ' from a life in which she struggled with depression			1
@entity8 , now a certified yoga instructor , recently relaunched her web site , noting that , ' i 'm not about to hide in shame			2
i 'm here , perfectly willing to remain in the public eye			0
' she is now a yoga instructor , who divides her time between @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91			0
her new website , which makes no direct mention of her escort girl past , says : ' sure , this site is designed to provide exposure for me and keep people up to date on what i have going on , but more than anything i hope it serves as a statement that i ’m not about to hide in shame			2
