by @entity1 reporter published : 09:48 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 12:00 est , 2 march 2014 one of the largest natural landslides in recent years took place in a remote area of southeastern @entity6 on february 16 , when 68 million tonnes of rock and debris crashed down a mountainside leaving deposits 40 foot deep			1
large landslides in remote locations used to go unnoticed , but a new crowdsourcing approach involving a @entity15 - based blogger , an @entity6 helicopter pilot and @entity17 , helped scientists pinpoint the exact location of this latest slide			1
this innovative new approach is the result of the discovery last year by two @entity25 scientists that seismic data can reveal the time , force , direction , and speed of a large landslide			1
unlike earthquakes , which release bursts of energy for a few seconds , landslides create sustained seismic readings that can last many minutes			0
one of the largest natural landslides in recent years took place in a remote area of southeastern @entity6 on february 16 , when 68 million tonnes of rock and debris crashed down a mountainside leaving deposits 40 foot deep large landslides in remote locations used to go unnoticed , but a new crowdsourcing approach involving a @entity15 - based blogger , an @entity6 helicopter pilot and @entity17 , helped scientists pinpoint the exact location of this latest slide images from the @entity48 showing @entity49 before the landslide , left , and afterwards with the debris clearly visible , right so when this recent big landslide occurred , its rumblings were quickly picked up by the network of seismic sensors in place around the globe to detect earthquakes			1
that seismic data put the @entity6 whopper somewhere in the vicinity of @entity61 and @entity62			1
unfortunately the seismometers can only locate where a landslide occurs to within 30 kilometers and from there it took a coordinated effort to track it down			2
key to this crowdsourcing effort was geographer @entity71 who works at @entity72 in the @entity15 and also runs the @entity73			0
two @entity25 scientists last year discovered that seismic data can reveal the time , force , direction , and speed of a large landslide that seismic data put the @entity6 landslide somewhere in the vicinity of @entity61 and @entity62 and helicopter pilot @entity83 located it on the flank of @entity49 scientists estimate that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet , almost the height of a five - story building			1
‘ i post the details and approximate location of the landslide , and we then , in effect , crowdsource finding it , ’ he told @entity91			0
his blog post was noticed by geomorpholgist @entity99 of the @entity100 , who contacted @entity6 helicopter pilot @entity83			2
about a week after the landslide occurred , @entity102 flew to the location and photographed the exact region where it happened , on the flank of @entity49			0
from the images , @entity71 estimated that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet , almost the height of a five - story building			1
seismic data revealed that the @entity6 whopper occurred somewhere in the vicinity of @entity61 and @entity62 about a week after the landslide occurred , @entity6 helicopter pilot @entity83 flew to the location and photographed the exact region where it happened @entity17 was also involved and their @entity118 - observing satellite @entity116 was used to take before and after shots of the impact area from space			1
without this coordinated online effort , @entity71 said , the @entity49 landslide might never have been spotted as snow quickly cover the impacted area			0
the new technique has helped scientists realize that landslides are much more common than once thought			0
‘ we used to think they were pretty rare , but we ’ve probably just missed them in the past , ’ said @entity71			0
researchers now think that roughly half a dozen big landslides happen in a typical year , though a massive earthquake can trigger as many as 40 large landslides			0
in recent years , the @entity73 has posted different teleseismic landslide detection events and the posts have helped to elicit help from @entity17 and other researchers and amateurs to help identify the event from the ground or space			2

the whopper took place in a remote part of @entity6 on february 16
using seismic data , scientists could only locate the slide to within 30km
a blogger in the @entity15 posted the findings online which *spurred* a helicopter pilot to explore the area and @entity17 to take photographs from space
debris from the landslide flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet - almost the height of a five - story building
