the ruling comes just three months after @entity0 was caught up in another racism row which prompted him to apologise and he was given a final warning about his behaviour by the @entity13			1
today 's ruling by @entity2 involved a scene in which the presenters were involved in the construction of a makeshift bridge over the @entity38			0
viewers saw an @entity23 man walking on the bamboo crossing , while @entity0 declared : ' that is a proud moment - but there is a slope on it			2
' two viewers were concerned that the word ' slope ' was an offensive racist term			2
an @entity2 spokesman said : ' after a thorough investigation , @entity2 has found the @entity13 breached broadcasting rules by including an offensive racial term in @entity17 , which was not justified by context			2

@entity0 ( centre ) pictured with @entity17 co-stars @entity15 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) during filming for the @entity16 special aired in march broadcast regulator @entity2 received two complaints about the ' slope ' comment made by @entity0 ( left ) ' this was scripted in advance			1
' the @entity13 failed to take the opportunity , either during filming or post-production , to check whether the word had the potential to offend viewers			1
' the programme 's executive producer , @entity74 , had previously apologised for the use of the term , saying it had been intended as a ' light - hearted word - play joke ' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive			0
the @entity13 has said today : ' we dealt with this matter some time ago , the programme apologised at the time and explained the context , and we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of @entity91 's best - loved shows			0
' the motoring programme has faced a number of controversies over the years and prompted complaints from @entity97 and @entity98 politicians over remarks made about their countries while filming on location			0
in its response to @entity2 , the @entity13 said that , although programme - makers ' knew that the word could be used to refer to people of @entity23 origin , they believed that such use was mere slang '			0
in its judgment , @entity2 said ' there was clearly an opportunity both during filming and post-production to research the word and reach a more considered view on whether it was " mere slang " and had the potential to cause offence to viewers '			0
the regulator decided there was ' insufficient context to justify the broadcast of this material ' and that the @entity13 did not apply generally accepted standards to protect viewers from offensive material .			1
