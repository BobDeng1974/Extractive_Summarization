by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 09:07 est , 8 november 2012 @entity1 has opened a broad new front its intellectual property war by patenting a rectangle with rounded corners			1
the @entity6 issued a patent for the ' ornamental design for a portable display device ' to the @entity11 , @entity12 - based tech giant this week			1
there have been claims in recent years , especially from @entity15 , that @entity1 has sought to patent any conceivable oblong - shaped gadget			2
rectangle with curved corners : figure 1 of patent no. @entity18 , 286			0
dashed lines indicate features not covered			0
the solid line marking the edges of the device is the design for which @entity1 now has exclusive rights during the massive lawsuit battle between the two companies , @entity1 claimed that its rival had copied rounded corners on its own range of phones and tablets - as well as in the icons those devices displayed on screen			1
responding to the allegations , the @entity38 firm noted that it was ' unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners			0
' well now , with the issue of patent no. @entity18 , 286 , it appears @entity1 really has finally been granted intellectual ownership over the shape of objects as diverse tablet computers and slices of cheese			1
the @entity54 patent granted on tuesday includes a number of drawings of the original @entity58 design , with most of the identifying features shown in dashed lines			1
the patent description explains that ' broken lines in the figures show portions of the portable display device which form no part of the claimed design '			0
the sole unbroken line in all the figures is the outline of the @entity58 's flat , rounded oblong front face			1
@entity1 originally filed the patent in december 2010 , @entity72 reports - several months after the first @entity58 was originally unveiled - but it has only just been granted			1
as a design patent , it covers only the device 's external appearance , which must by ' ornamental ' and serve no practical function			2
rectangular : the design of @entity1 's original @entity58 , left , has been at the heart of patent disputes between the @entity12 tech giant and its @entity38 rival @entity15 , whose @entity87 machine is pictured right @entity1 had originally asserted patent @entity90 , 889 against @entity15 as part of its lawsuit claiming the smartphone rival had copied the @entity95 and @entity58 design for its @entity97 and @entity87 devices			1
@entity15 's @entity98 has become the world 's best - selling smartphone model for the last quarter , pushing aside @entity95			0
@entity1 has dominated the chart for more than two years , research firm @entity101 said			2
it claims @entity15 sold 18 million @entity98 models in the third quarter , compared with @entity106 sales of 16.2 million			0
strong sales of the flagship @entity98 - which comes with a large 4.8 inch touchscreen - helped @entity15 post a record $ 7.3billion operating profit in the july - september quarter			0
@entity1 customers were also believed to be waiting for the release of the @entity114 , which is expected to propel @entity1 back to the top spot			2
after some to - ing and fro - ing a jury finally ruled that @entity15 had not infringed that patent , which was awarded in 2005 and appears to be based on an earlier @entity58 prototype , but had infringed several others			2
now the new patent appears to give @entity1 rights over the intellectual property that older patent was ruled not to			0
legal experts have , however , argued that its uncertain whether this new patent would be of any use to the company in court			0
@entity130 , associate professor at @entity132 's @entity131 , told @entity72 : ' this design patent gives @entity1 no new advantage , because no one is out there trying to market an @entity58 lookalike			1
' a commenter on arstechnica also explains that design patents are extremely narrow , with competitors having to do their ' level best ' to replicate the design to infringe them			0
the commenter adds that almost every company with products of a distinctive shape applies for them , from @entity148 for its @entity149 to @entity150 for @entity151			0
nevertheless , with the rectangular shape of the @entity58 being far from as distinctive as either of those two examples , it does seem that @entity1 really has patented the rectangle .			1

@entity6 finally granted to cover the design of @entity1 's original @entity58
