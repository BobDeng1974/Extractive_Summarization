their ill - fated polar expedition became known as one of the most doomed in history			1
however , a century after captain @entity5 and much of his @entity7 crew perished in a @entity9 blizzard , details have emerged of how other explorers on his team survived for months by eating penguin meat and seal blubber			1
a little - known account has emerged of how six of the @entity7 's stranded explorers lived for seven months in an @entity18 ice cave , until they were strong enough to embark on a 200 - mile trek for survival			1
photographs , documents and drawings which detail the party 's monumental struggle for survival have emerged 100 years after the doomed expedition - and they are due to be sold at auction			1
pictured outside their ice cave ( from left to right ) : commander @entity32 , surgeon @entity33 , geologist @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and seaman @entity37 dr @entity38 was on captain @entity5 ’s doomed @entity7 expedition to the @entity9 and was part of a scientific research team that found itself marooned on pack ice			1
the men were forced to cocoon themselves in an improvised igloo and live off a revolting diet of penguin meat and seal blubber to survive			0
after seeing out the harsh winter they mustered the strength to trek 200 miles over five weeks to reach safety			0
it is thought the crew member 's incredible story of survival was largely overlooked by history because the heroic death of captain @entity5 was so sensational			1
the accounts , photographs and diagrams from dr @entity33 that are being sold by a private owner have brought the remarkable tale back from the cold			1
having spent the summer months observing a colony of @entity67 penguins , @entity33 and the others soon realised the @entity7 ship would not be back to pick them up as arranged			1
amazing story of survival : @entity33 's sketch of the ice cave igloo where he was stranded with five other explorers is revealed for the first time diarist : dr @entity38 in his finneskos - or reindeer boots ( left ) - and wrapped up against the elements ( right ) rations menu : @entity33 's documentation of the men 's diet reveal just how revolting it was the vessel was unable to reach the party due to heavy pack ice			1
with little food or equipment and wearing clothes unsuited for an @entity18 winter , the men abandoned their tents and dug an ice cave - or igloo as dr @entity33 described it			1
he drew a diagram of the cave including positions of where the men slept and he described how biscuit boxes were used in the construction			1
he wrote how ice was good at conducting heat so the cave was surrounded by snow , which was n’t			1
stranded on the aptly named @entity106 from february to september 1912 the men were forced to live off seal blubber and penguin meat			0
the details of the diet were recorded by @entity112 , 36 , including the effects of eating blubber that caused retching and sickness			2
disgusting diet : the party survived on combination of penguin meat and seal blubber , which caused retching and sickness he wrote : ' we had great difficulty in eating the blubber , and as our biscuit ration was reduced to 1 biscuit per day each , we had to eat very large quantities of lean meat to satisfy our hunger			2
' this led to a craving for starchy food that would never be satisfied			0
' listing the menu for the men between february 24 and march 17 , dr @entity33 wrote : ' morning : 1 pint hoosh ( sealmeat and blubber ) 1 spoonful of cocoa in a pint of hot water			2
' he added : ' when all was ready the cook shouted ' mugs ready '			0
' immediately each man passed up his aluminium sledging mug ... remaining in their bags to eat it			0
' another problem was the lack of salt , and using sea water instead merely gave the men diarrhoea			0
@entity157 fated : @entity18 explorer captain @entity5 a further predicament - one that nearly killed them - was when a blizzard sealed the cave and the stove , powered by seal blubber , almost asphyxiated them all			1
the men , known as the @entity166 , were led by @entity32 , but it was dr @entity33 ’s medical knowledge that ensured they lived			2
to pass the hours lying in their sleeping bags , dr @entity33 wrote his detailed account and described how he read to the men			2
he wrote : ' i started reading to the party in the evenings			0
our library consisted of @entity178 , @entity179 , the life of @entity181 and @entity182			0
' i started on @entity178 and read a chapter every night			0
' @entity184 was another consolation and there can rarely have been a more heartfelt tribute to pipe smoking than dr @entity33 ’s			2
he wrote : ' now pipes and tobacco have for hundreds of years soothed and cheered the heart of @entity192 , but i do not believe that the blessings of the precious plant have ever been felt and appreciated more than they are now being felt and appreciated by us			0
' after seven months the men attempted to make it to safety on september 30 and arrived at @entity199 200 miles away on november 7			0
they then learned of the fate of capt @entity5 , who had died on his return from the @entity9			1
a search party that had been sent to look for the @entity166 had found their empty tents and were amazed when they learned the men had survived			2
as well as the commander , @entity32 , and dr @entity33 , the other men were @entity34 , a geologist , and petty officers @entity210 and @entity212 , and seaman @entity213			2
dr @entity33 ’s accounts of the experience and the photographs are being sold by auctioneers @entity217 and are expected to fetch about 30,000 pounds			1
dr @entity33 later wrote a groundbreaking study of @entity67 , the first serious monograph on the species			0
a spokesman from @entity217 said : ' the story of dr @entity33 and his companions is a truly remarkable tale of survival against horrific odds , resourcefulness and real heroism but it is not well known			0
' if captain @entity5 ’s tragic fate were not so powerfully etched into the @entity232 soul the exploits of this other intrepid group of heroic @entity232 would be celebrated much more widely			1
' these smoke stained , weather beaten notebooks of dr @entity33 show why			0
' the auction takes place in @entity241 on march 30 .			0

details emerge of how crew from captain @entity5 's doomed @entity7 expedition survived in an ice cave
photographs , documents and drawings created by survivor dr @entity38 are to be sold at auction
