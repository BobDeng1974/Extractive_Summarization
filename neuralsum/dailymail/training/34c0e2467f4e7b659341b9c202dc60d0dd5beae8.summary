@entity1 's @entity0 was surprised by his own brilliant form after claiming a commanding lead in the @entity4 in pursuit of a third win of the season			1
@entity0 , who shot rounds of 63 and 61 to win the rain - shortened @entity9 masters three weeks ago , fired a third round of 63 at @entity11 to reach 22 under par , four strokes ahead of @entity15 hero @entity14 , who compiled a brilliant 62			1
the 24 - year - old tournament leader failed to win any of his three group matches in the @entity18 but is now a combined 40 under par for his last five stroke play rounds and has made 23 birdies and just one bogey in 54 holes in @entity24			1
@entity0 acknowledges the applause of the crowd after making a putt on the third day in @entity24 @entity0 overtook his playing partner @entity28 to assume the lead at the @entity4 @entity30 ' i played amazing golf , ' said @entity0 , who won his first @entity34 title in the @entity35 in april			1
' i 'm very surprised by myself			2
i started well and made some early birdies and hit some amazing shots			1
i am very happy with the way i played golf today			2
' @entity0 began the day a shot behind halfway leader @entity28 , but birdied the first three holes and picked up further shots on the sixth and seventh to reach the turn in 31 , before almost holing his approach to the 10th to set up another birdie			1
the tee on the par - four 11th had been moved forward to encourage players to attempt to drive the green and although @entity0 was one of the few players not to take it on , his decision was vindicated when he played another brilliant wedge shot to two feet			1
@entity14 was matching @entity0 's scoring exploits , the @entity55 covering the front nine in 32 and picking up further shots on the 10th , 11th , 13th and 14th before holing his second to the 16th for an eagle two			1
@entity0 almost replied with an eagle of his own , narrowly missing from eight feet on the par - five 15th , but the birdie extended his lead to four shots over @entity14 , with @entity63 's @entity62 another stroke back after a 65			1
@entity0 ( left ) smiles as he takes over at the top of the leaderboard from @entity67 ( right ) @entity28 carded two birdies and one bogey to lose ground having started round three with a one - shot lead ' it 's nice to be in this position , ' @entity0 added			1
' it was pretty much the same when i won in @entity76 so i am going to enjoy the game tomorrow , do my best and see what happens			0
' @entity14 's scored matched his course record from 2012 , although it will not count for record purposes due to the preferred lies in operation			2
' obviously the course suits my game , ' said the 39 - year - old , who won the @entity89 masters in august to secure his @entity15 debut and then clinched the winning point at @entity92 by beating @entity93 in the singles			0
' i 've shot 10 under before and i 've done it today which is great			0
i got the ball rolling better on the greens which made a big difference and obviously that shot on 16 is a big bonus			0
' i had 142 ( yards ) to the flag , slightly uphill into the wind which was a soft nine iron and it came off spot on			0
pitched just past the hole and spun back and went in			0
it 's quite a narrow entrance into that green from where i was but it pitched perfect and obviously is a bonus to see it go in			2
' i 've been playing well for a few years now so things have been getting better each year			0
i 've been improving and winning was just a matter of time			0
now it 's obviously to a point where i 'm trying to win more than once in a year			2
everything is a progression and i 'm just working towards getting better and moving the goal posts			0
' @entity119 and @entity120 have a chat on the seventh hole during the third round of the @entity4 @entity15 star @entity14 found himself five shots behind @entity0 @entity14 's @entity15 team - mate @entity119 was four over par after four holes on thursday and although he recovered to shoot 72 and then add rounds of 65 and 64 , still found himself seven shots off the lead			1
' i think i 've done my part but i did n't bank on everyone else going as low as they are , ' @entity131 said			0
' obviously mr @entity0 is going ridiculous out there right now			2
i would have thought i 'd be in a bit better shape going into sunday than i am , but every credit to the lads that are keeping it going out there			0
' if everything went my way today , five better is what i could have been			0
i missed probably five putts inside eight feet today and still shot eight under par. i had three eagle putts out there , so plenty of opportunities to go low			0
' quite clearly there 's lots of birdies to be had out there and i do n't know if things are going to change tomorrow , i hear there 's a bit of wind coming in so that might spice things up			2
' overnight leader @entity28 is nine shots off the pace after a 73 which included a double - bogey six on the 18th .			1

@entity1 's @entity0 leads after the third round of @entity30
he overtook @entity169 @entity28 to assume leadership
@entity0 birdied the first three holes and gained further shots on six and seven
@entity175 could only card two birdies and one bogey to lose ground
