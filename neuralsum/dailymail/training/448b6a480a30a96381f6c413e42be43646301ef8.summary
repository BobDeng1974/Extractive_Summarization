by @entity1 reporter a terrified patient mistakenly thought he had died during surgery after being given a full anaesthetic without his knowledge			1
@entity6 , 65 , had gone in for routine elective surgery to ease aches and pains in his right shoulder caused by arthritis - but was put to sleep in a potentially lethal medically induced coma			1
he only began to wake 20 hours after the procedure at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 unable to see a thing and hearing murmuring voices in the darkness			1
nightmare : @entity6 was supposed to be mildly sedated for surgery for arthritis pain			1
instead he was given a full anaesthetic and woke 20 hours later - paralysed , unable to see and only hearing voices the incident occurred despite mr @entity6 ’s orthopaedic surgeon warning doctors at the hospital - not to proceed with a general anaesthetic because it might be deadly due to his angina and heart problems			1
' the hospital acted like a bull in a china shop with my treatment , ' said mr @entity6 , from @entity39			1
' i remember waking up sometime after the operation and honestly thought i was dead			1
' it was just total blackness and not just the sort you get when you close your eyes			2
i was hearing voices but unable to see anything			1
' i was terrified as i was totally paralysed			2
i even cursed myself for believing that when you died all your senses left you because this was obviously not true as i could still hear voices			1
i feel really angry the hospital put me at risk like that			1
' the way the staff behaved was like in a death camp of the modern world			2
if i knew what they were going to do then what i knew now i would n’t have gone through with it			2
' mr @entity6 had developed arthritis as a result of heavy lifting during his job as a self employed plumber and kitchen fitter			1
he had been due to undergo a local anaesthetic - type procedure known as as an @entity70 with mild sedation on the nerve so he would be awake			1
but on the day of the surgery , the hospital ’s two anaesthetists were on leave despite a letter to the hospital ’s @entity78 asking that someone be available			1
oversight : mr @entity6 has received a letter from @entity14 admitting there had been ' a failure in internal communication ' during a staff handover a review of his medical records was held during an anaesthetic assessment , but it was agreed that general anaesthetic would only be administered to mr @entity6 in a life saving procedure			1
mr @entity6 added : ' i explicitly said i could n’t have the general anaesthetic and that it was on my notes			1
' i was told my heart was not strong enough to have it and it could lead to another heart attack and then death			2
' i said i was n’t going to sign for it but the doctor in duty that day told me he did n’t do pain blocks			2
i told him to find someone who did			2
i feel really angry that they put me at risk			2
' mr @entity6 said he was then seen by another doctor who mr @entity6 believed would carry out the procedure who injected him with ' a white cloudy liquid '			1
he added : “ that was the last thing i remember			0
at no stage was there any discussion about any procedure , any risks , what drugs were being used , and how the assumed sedation would work			2
no one came by with the consent form to do the operation			0
” before eventually coming round properly , mr @entity6 drifted in and out of consciousness saying he was experiencing symptoms similar to ' psychedelic trips '			1
he said : ' i regained my sight later on and slowly the use of my limbs			0
this was when i recall coming round to be met by staff			0
i gestured to one to give me a pen and paper and i asked him if i was dying			0
' when he said no and then asked him if i ’d had a stroke as this seemed more plausible because of the paralysis			0
it was only when he said no and that i realised i was going to be okay			0
' the hospital have overstepped the mark by operating without my consent			0
i should have been safeguarded			0
with my previous operations their first words are ‘ have you consented ’			0
' i did n’t invite them to do what they did to me and in no way am i culpable			0
i was truly honest with them and said i did n’t feel like my heart was good enough for the operation under general anaesthetic , i know my own body			0
it ’s fate that i ’m still here today			0
scared : before eventually coming round , mr @entity6 says he experienced symptoms similar to ' psychedelic trips ' ' it was there in black and white not to proceed with the general anaesthetic , it was blatantly obvious			1
it ’s not rocket science			0
i ’m bewildered that it happened , it was not as if it was written in a foreign language			0
' they still have n’t given me a reason as to why they gave me a general anaesthetic			0
the two people who do that procedure were both off that day			2
you would think they should have just said they could n’t go ahead but they just did			0
' mr @entity6 complained to @entity169 ( @entity170 ) and the complaints team at @entity14 and received a letter admitting there had been ' a failure in internal communication ' during a staff handover			1
in a statement , @entity177 , director of nursing at @entity14 said : ' a plan of action was agreed with mr @entity6 and we acknowledge there were communication difficulties during the procedure			1
' however , the clinical decision was made in the interest of patient safety			0
' in 2009 the hospital was identified as having the third highest mortality rate in @entity191			0
last july two previously unpublished critical reviews commissioned by the hospital emerged which revealed concerns about chronic under - staffing and sub-standard care .			0
