an @entity1 saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the @entity5 at @entity6 on sunday			2
wearing red was @entity8 , who has recovered so hearteningly from two bouts of gruelling brain surgery four years ago			2
wearing blue was @entity12 , the party boy who took a six - month leave of absence to mend his wild ways			1
in the end it was the man hell - bent on his redemptive mission who came out on top as @entity12 closed with a final round 69 to win by one from @entity8 , who had begun the final round with a five shot lead			1
@entity12 ( right ) celebrates with his caddie @entity25 on the eighteenth hole at @entity6 @entity12 proudly holds the @entity5 trophy following his victory on sunday ' it means everything to win again , ' said @entity12 , who admitted his break was due to issues with alcohol and was competing in just his fifth event on his return			1
' it has been a tough road but a lot of good has come out of it and i feel great now			0
this has to be the best win of my career			0
' @entity12 has long had a reputation as one of @entity1 's most gifted talents but was in danger of throwing it all away			1
now he looks a reformed character			0
the latest world rankings out on monday are likely to show him up to 6th and he ' s quite capable of giving @entity51 a run for his money at the top			1
masters champion @entity55 led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th and finished third			1
@entity12 went the other way , playing his last 11 holes so artfully that he completed the sequence in a telling three under par. it was hard not to feel sorry for @entity8			1
he had opened the tournament with a 62 that was so good it might well stand as the round of the year			2
but he blew his chances with a terrible start that saw his five shot lead dwindle to nothing before the first 90 minutes of play was completed			2
@entity12 celebrates his birdie on the 15th hole during the final round of action on sunday as for @entity51 , his troubles with the plethora of water hazards continued right to the end , as he put not only his drive on the 18th into the water , but his third shot as well			1
before the start of his final round , @entity86 , preposterous owner of this overrated venue , had presented @entity51 with the three iron he had tossed infamously into the water on friday , after it was retrieved by a scuba diver			1
@entity51 took it out of his bag once on sunday - to play that third shot at the last			1
thanks a lot , @entity97 , he must have been thinking			0
@entity51 shaped up to throw the offending implement into the water once more , but this time kept hold of it			1
it was a moment of light relief at the end of a seriously trying week for the world number one			0
@entity55 led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th at least he finished off with a more typical example of his artistry			1
through the back of the green and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple bogey seven or still worse , @entity51 chipped the ball in for a six			1
even so , it rather undid the good work he displayed earlier , and meant he signed for a 71			1
he still finished in the top ten , though			1
all those missed putts and shots into the water , and still only a handful of players beat him			0
' it was certainly an adventurous week and the game 's just not quite there , ' he admitted			2
' i 'm pretty disappointed with the way i played overall			0
but there were signs of improvement			0
' he will look to build on those during a two day trip to @entity136 , beginning on monday			0
he will play just one more tournament – the @entity138 next week – before his historic tilt at a career grand slam at the masters next month			0
@entity51 plays a shot on the second hold during a disappointing final day of action for the world no 1 round of the day came from @entity149 's @entity148 , who shot 68 to finish tied 12th			1
this was a fine confidence boost for the 27 - year - old @entity152 ahead of his first appearance at @entity142			0
' i 'm obviously very pleased , ' he said			0
' it 's a tough course and the set - up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week , i 'd have bitten your hand off if you 'd offered me that on thursday			2
when you 're playing with the top 50 you know they 're not going to give you anything , but i 'm feeling more comfortable all the time playing at this level			2
' how far can he go ? one area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already			0
' i 'm taking painkillers and managing it , ' he said			0
' i 'm going to stay over here through the masters because flying back and forth is no good for it			0
there 's no point worrying about it , i 've just got to get on with it			2
' he is doing that all right .			0
