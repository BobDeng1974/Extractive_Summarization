by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 12 november 2013 tipping the scales at just four - and - a - half stone , 35 - year - old anorexic @entity2 's life was in serious danger			1
but her 20 - year battle against the eating disorder was given a boost when she adopted four @entity10 spaniels , which she says , gave her a reason to live			1
now , she has turned her life around and has gained three stone - all thanks to the dogs , named @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
recovery : @entity2 with her @entity10 ( from left ) @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity18 reason to live : @entity2 says the dogs gave her a reason to carry on and would n't have made it without them ' my dogs are my life - they brought me back from the dead , ' explains the recovering anorexic who hails from @entity30			1
' without their regular visits , and their compassion and love , i simply would n’t have made it			0
they were my goal from beginning to end - to see them and to stay alive for them			2
' @entity2 , who has owned the dogs , all aged between seven and nine years old , even told concerned doctors that she knew she would pull through because of her cherished canines			1
' when i was in hospital , the doctors would ask me " what ’s your goal or reason for recovery ? " i would always say ‘ my dogs are my goal ’			1
” @entity2 now weighs seven stone and has been out of hospital for a year - the longest she has ever managed without an admission			1
her illness began when she was a teenager and she started skipping meals while working busy shifts at a hair dressing salon			0
but the illness soon began to take a toll as her weight plummeted to six - and - a - half stone and her hair began falling out			1
frightening : at her lowest point , @entity2 was so thin and weak that she had to be hospitalised repeatedly faithful friends : @entity2 says the dogs ' love and compassion towards her made a huge difference to her life getting better : @entity2 now weighs seven stone and has n't been hospitalised for a year - a record for her her parents @entity72 , 64 , and @entity73 , 66 , took her to see their gp who said it was just a phase			1
but when the weight continued to drop off her already skeletal frame she was diagnosed with anorexia and admitted to hospital			0
' i never intended not to eat			0
i just never felt hungry and i was so busy that i did n’t consider what it was doing to me , ' reveals @entity2			2
' i was never a typical anorexic because it was n’t that i did n’t want to eat , i just forgot , and then it got to the point where i could n’t eat			0
' it was n’t until i was admitted to hospital that i decided if everyone thought i was anorexic , i may as well act like it			0
' and act like it she did , with the result that her weight plummeted to less than five stone			2
and worse was to come			0
by now seriously ill , she collapsed in the snow one @entity97 and broke her shoulder before being re-admitted to hospital			0
' if i had n’t broken my arm then i probably would have died , as i would never have willingly gone back to hospital , ' she admits			0
but even that was n't enough of a wake - up call and she endured three further relapses before checking herself into the retreat rehab centre in @entity106			2
at the clinic , she was given a private room and felt in control of her own recovery , both of which , she says , made a difference - but her dogs were her main inspiration			1
' they were brought in to see me and each time they left they would put their noses up to the glass , spurring me on to get better			0
' ' i ’ve had them since they were pups , and they are my babies			0
whenever i have been low , it is my dogs that have helped me bounce back			2
' i talk to them about my problems - and obviously i can trust them not to tell anyone ! ' although one , @entity16 , sadly died from cancer in august , @entity2 says her recovery is continuing apace			1
' i just need to remember that i have three others - and of course my parents - for support			0

@entity2 , 35 , from @entity30 weighed four stone at her worst
she *credits* her @entity143 spaniels with her recovery
says the much - loved dogs give her a reason to go on living
