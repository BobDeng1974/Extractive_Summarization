by @entity1 reporter published : 17:38 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 31 august 2013 police in @entity3 , @entity4 , received an unusual call earlier this month when a teenager phoned requesting assistance to deal with a ‘ massive ’ spider			2
the caller , @entity9 , was n’t a prankster or someone with an extreme phobia of spiders , but instead suffers from muscular dystrophy and is wheelchair - bound			2
she believed the spider was a brown recluse , a species with venom so toxic that it could have been deadly for her compromised immune system			1
just a few days prior , her mom @entity28 had been bitten by a spider on the back of her leg during the night , which had resulted in a nasty wound and a trip to the emergency room			1
initially @entity9 tried to call her mother , her father , the friends her parents were with , her own friends and two neighbors			0
when she could n’t reach anyone , @entity9 decided to call the non-emergency police hotline as a last resort			1
@entity9 said she felt silly calling police to kill the spider , but said she legitimately feared for her safety @entity9 , who has muscular dystrophy , said she was afraid that the spider - which she believed to be a deadly venomous brown recluse - would harm her or little brother the audio from her police call reveals a rather comical scene			1
' i 'm home alone and there is a giant spider on the back of my couch , and i 'm talking giant			1
i 've never seen a spider this big and i have no idea what to do , ' she told the slightly perplexed operator			0
the teen estimated the spider was the size of a baseball and said it was appeared similar to a tarantula			0
she told the dispatcher that she generally was n't fazed by spiders , but a family member was recently bitten by one and had to go to the hospital			0
she also explained that she had initially tried to get hold of her parents but failed			0
' i do n't know if you guys have anything i can do , or if i just sit here and stare at it and wait for someone to get home to kill it , ' she asked			0
the dispatcher is heard telling her that since she does n't feel safe , he will send someone over to her house			0
in the end , a total of four police officers showed up at their house			0
when the officers arrived at the home , they reported finding a spider that was about two inches in diameter and they quickly disposed of it with an old - fashioned rolled up newspaper			1
throughout the situation , @entity9 said the officers remained professional , despite the seemingly absurd circumstances			2
a student at @entity104 in a suburb of @entity3 , @entity9 admits she felt silly calling the police department to kill a spider - but she insists it really was a danger to her and her brother			1
spider : a @entity112 teen recently called 911 to report an intruder in her home , pictured , but rather than a brazen thief , it turned out to be a ' massive freaking ' spider ' just seeing a spider that big and knowing what it did to my immune system and me having a compromised immune system and a younger brother , i just knew that it was n't good and i had to call someone , ' @entity9 told @entity127			1
though it 's not standard protocol for them to respond to a call about a spider , @entity129 police said they decided to help the young lady out in this instance			1
@entity9 said they insisted she keep the dead spider and send it in for testing - because they had never seen one that big , either			2
she also said she feels grateful that she lives in the sort of town where a teenager can summon a police officer to kill a spider			0
dangerous : @entity148 recluse spiders , like the one pictured , are very venomous and can even kill bite victims - though they are seldom aggressive			0

@entity9 called the police after *spotting* the giant spider in her home
she believed it was brown recluse which could have killed her and which had bitten her mom days before
going against protocol , police decided to help the young lady and four officers arrived to swat the spider with a newspaper
