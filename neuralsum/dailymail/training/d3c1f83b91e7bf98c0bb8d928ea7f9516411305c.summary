the fact that humans live beyond their reproductive usefulness has long been thought to be a biological process that uniquely separates us from the great apes			1
but the discovery of an orangutan going through menopause could nullify that theory - and suggest we ’re not so dissimilar after all			1
@entity10 , an orangutan at @entity12 in @entity13 , was being tested for breeding when scientists found she was no longer fertile			1
previously thought almost exclusive to humans			1
scroll down for a world - first video of an orangutan giving birth ( warning : graphic content ) @entity10 , pictured here with her baby @entity22 , is the first ape found to have undergone a menopause			1
this biological process was originally thought to be exclusive to humans			1
this suggests humans are not as dissimilar from orangutans as first thought the research will feature in @entity33 documentary series born in the @entity34 on 22 june			1
@entity12 is located on the island of @entity13 in the @entity36			2
it was founded by naturalist and conservationist @entity39 in 1958 , then called @entity12			0
@entity39 passed away in 1995 but is survived by his wife @entity41 , who now runs the park			0
since then the park has grown enormously with almost 200,000 visitors passing through its gates every year			0
it is also heavily involved in the conservation and protection of endangered species through the @entity50			0
this international charity works globally to save species from extinction			0
@entity10 is a wild - caught female that was confiscated from smugglers at @entity57 airport in the 1960s , and has been a resident at @entity39 since 1968			2
in those 46 years @entity10 has given birth to seven babies , most notably the male @entity62 in 2004 , who was born by caesarean section - the first such procedure carried out on an orangutan			2
almost a decade after @entity22 ’s birth , the now 49 - year - old @entity10 was being considered for breeding			1
female orangutans are widely believed to remain fertile until the end of their lives , rather than undergoing a menopause , as seen in humans with whom they share 97.6 per cent of the same dna			1
before making the decision to breed with her , @entity10 was scheduled to be fully health - screened to establish whether she could safely contribute another genetically important youngster to the captive breeding program for her species			1
in addition , her reproductive status was assessed and these procedures coincided with the filming of this episode			0
@entity10 was being prepared for breeding when it was found that she had undergone a menopause			1
the finding was made during an ultrasound examination ( pictured ) that showed the tell - tale signs of a post-menopausal reproductive system however , whilst anaesthetised , vets noticed one facet of @entity10 ’s assessment was unusual			1
during the ultrasound examination carried out by @entity96 , consultant obstetrician at @entity97 , @entity10 ’s uterus , endometrium ( lining of the uterus ) and vagina unexpectedly displayed tell - tale signs of what - in a human patient - would indicate a post-menopausal reproductive system			2
a further series of blood tests affirmed that @entity10 is believed to be the world ’s first medically - confirmed case of an orangutan that has undergone a non-pathological age - related cessation of reproductive abilities - a menopause			1
“ i suppose that i ’m not totally surprised to find that orangutans have a menopause - they really are so very similar to humans , ’ said @entity96			1
‘ indeed it looks as if they go through the menopause at a very similar age			0
‘ now the orangutans are living longer , we will probably see more in the menopausal state , and this will allow breeding programmes to be better managed			2
‘ @entity10 has really been an informative animal and i hope she can now relax a little from being such a wonderful mother			2
’ a further series of blood tests affirmed that @entity10 is believed to be the world 's first medically - confirmed case of an orangutan that has undergone a non-pathological age - related cessation of reproductive abilities - a menopause			1
she is shown here being carried to the hospital by vets the programme also features the @entity39 staff ’s footage of their 25 - year - old orangutan @entity142 giving birth to her first surviving baby			0
this is the most detailed - if not the world ’s first - footage of an orangutan birth			0
following a stillbirth in 2009 that almost cost her life @entity142 had been considered infertile			0
however , @entity96 ’s pioneering work to clear @entity142 ’s blocked fallopian tubes resulted in a pregnancy in 2012			0
staff at @entity39 , determined to ensure @entity142 and baby would survive her 2013 delivery , watched her around the clock			0
as a result they were present , with cameras rolling , when she went into labour late one june evening			0
catch @entity166 at 8pm this sunday on @entity33 we are incredibly fortunate to have the support of our collaborative medical colleagues on @entity13 , ' said @entity39 ’s @entity170 , @entity171			2
' working with the team at the @entity12 we have , together , been able to make huge advances in the reproductive health care and breeding management of these incredible apes			0
' @entity39 hope that the new findings broadcast in this programme will further compel people to speak up for orangutans , and support their conservation , before they are lost from @entity182 forever			0
@entity193 added : ‘ realising how close to humans the orangutans are , i just wish that the rest of mankind would give them the same respect that they deserve and the support to live in peace , in their own environment ; surely their basic civil rights ? ‘			0

@entity196 at @entity13 has gone through the menopause
@entity10 was being tested for breeding when scientists made the discovery
it is the first time an ape has been found to go through the process
it suggests humans and apes are not as dissimilar as thought
humans and orangutans share 97.6 per cent of their dna , but it was thought menopause was a sign we were significantly more *evolved*
