@entity0 exit @entity1 with a solitary point and two goals to show for all the blood , sweat and millions of pounds spent on this @entity7 adventure			1
it has been a sorry return			2
they finish anchored somewhat miserably to the bottom of @entity11 , but will be back in competitive action in the autumn for the @entity15 qualifiers			1
there are big decisions ahead for @entity18 about the direction of this team and maybe even one or two glimmers of encouragement to be found , somewhere within his ' realm of despair '			1
@entity25 : an athletic performance made @entity18 ’s odd experiment with @entity28 at right back all the more puzzling			1
thought it must be said that any full - back appears more solid with @entity28 ahead in midfield			1
@entity18 moved @entity28 to help @entity31 midway through the first - half			1
@entity25 is a talented player , has physical presence which is useful at set - pieces and still only 22			1
it is time for him to find a position			2
right - back is certainly an option , where he gets up and down the wing , attacks well , but he needs to gain experience there			1
he can be reckless and his positional play sometimes lacking			2
he was almost caught out by a long ball on half - time			2
staying put : @entity25 has don enough to suggest he deserves to keep his place in the squad @entity49 : made a terribly nervous start			2
his distribution was poor , especially on his left side , and he seemed a little at sea between @entity56 and @entity31			2
he settled down as it went on but plays with such a casual air that sloppiness spreads through the team , a dangerous prospect in the heart of defence			2
there were better signs later in the game , proof he is strong in the air , mobile and quick across the ground , be it to intercept or to recover			2
@entity31 : the only real signs of his youth are in a positional sense			2
sometimes he was a little too eager to fly past his winger			2
he allowed situations to develop around him without organising team - mates around to provide cover , and the @entity81 were keen to come and play on his wing in the first half			2
these things he will learn			2
otherwise he is a remarkable prospect , the sort which commands a £ 40m price - tag			2
he was fast and comfortable on the ball and keen and decisive in attack while strong in defensive duels as he proved in the final seconds			2
@entity7 bow : @entity31 started on the left for @entity0 in what he will hope will be the first of many appearances at the greatest show on earth @entity100 : plenty of questions still to be answered , starting with his physical condition			1
can he stay injury - free ? is he fully fit ? has the zip that takes him past opponents gone for good ? will it return as his fitness improves ? has he enough in his game if it has gone ? he can tackle but can he defend ? it can not be easy with the pressure , because he is perhaps the one @entity0 are most desperate to see develop			1
he punched in and out			0
he adds aggression , forward thrust and vision with quality on the ball to a midfield soon without @entity121 and possibly @entity122			0
but he limped off again			0
@entity123 : the man who was the find of the friendlies from november to june was suddenly dropped by @entity18 on the eve of the @entity7 to accommodate @entity128			1
@entity0 injected extra pace and dare but lost their balance			1
@entity123 provides control and intelligence when he plays well			0
when he first came in and flourished he seemed better with better players around him , made for international football , like @entity135			1
he is imaginative on the ball , the sort of thing required to unlock well organised defences , but he was subdued			0
perhaps confidence has been knocked			0
perhaps he needs more experience at the level			0
perhaps he is one for some team shapes and not others , but he is worth persisting with			0
agonisingly close : @entity123 hits a shot past @entity146 @entity147 : fresh and exciting , with wonderful footwork and the priceless ability to go past defenders			0
in the heat of a competitive fixture against @entity155 – more competitive than might have been expected - and with the added responsibility of starting the game , his shortcomings were more clear than in the warm - up friendlies			1
as @entity18 pointed out after he dazzled against @entity159 , he took risks in dangerous areas and struggled at times to impose himself on the game			1
the manager may have called this one right			0
he was targeted with some rough stuff and was booked for a shirt pull			0
@entity167 : wasted good chances			1
might have won the game but he is @entity0 ’s most lethal finisher and most consistent goal threat			1
he is sharp in tight spaces and sees openings , if sometimes over-intricate and too ambitious			0
one of the fundamental decisions of the summer for @entity18 concerns @entity167 and @entity176			1
does he devise a way to accommodate them both in attack – possibly two up front with @entity128 in behind , three midfielders and the wingers sacrificed - or to choose one of them up front and not the other ? in			1
the wrong side of the post : @entity167 squandered a fine chance to give @entity0 the lead against @entity155 @entity128 : amazing in training , sent - off in @entity189 , flickered against @entity191 , vanished against @entity192 and started on the bench against @entity155			1
when he came on , his first contribution was to put his head down and dribble the ball out of play			0
then he surrendered possession and put his defence in trouble			0
it has been an adventure of highs and lows , but @entity128 seems unfazed at the idea of providing @entity0 ’s extra dimension			1
his pace is electric and he slices through a team in seconds			0
at this moment , he looks like the one to construct the next generation around			0
@entity212 : done little wrong , yet barely made a save			0
can be @entity214 for the next decade but would be nice if some pressure was applied			0
@entity216 : kept a goal well against @entity155 and has proved an able deputy to @entity212 , though he can be erratic			1
safe hands : @entity216 holds on to a cross during a @entity155 attack @entity222 : @entity224 contribution has been cameraman in the @entity56 ’s video diaries as they tricked @entity212			1
@entity228 : time to look for a better right - back			2
there are a few around			0
one must step forward to claim the place			0
the end of an era : @entity228 ( right ) stretches with @entity235 team - mates @entity122 and @entity128 @entity236 : not enhanced case to be future left - back , but not well protected in his games			1
much depends on @entity31 ’s progress			0
@entity56 : he ’s not @entity242 but it ’s time for him to become the leader of this defence , organise and impose authority			0
@entity247 : brave and honest but limitations exposed at the very highest level			0
strengthening in central defence is a priority			0
time to go : @entity0 should move on from @entity253 ( left ) and @entity247 ( right ) @entity122 : time to go for his own sake , but no heir apparent in midfield is a big concern			1
@entity18 must delay his exit			1
@entity121 : see @entity122 , but two years older			0
played well and a fine example to young players but time to go			1
frustration : @entity100 remonstrates with the referee after losing out on a decision @entity28 : under - used as if @entity18 feared the “ cautious ” implications of his selection			1
his bite may solve central midfield issue			0
@entity267 : impressive in the friendlies , anonymous when the bar was raised			0
his energy is vital but does not pass it well			0
@entity273 : ought to have gone home and replaced			0
stuck around , got injured again			0
key part of the future when fit			2
much maligned : but @entity28 impressed against @entity155 and should be used for future tournaments			1
@entity278 : sometimes looks the part , often does n’t			0
more consistently may emerge if he finds regular club football			0
@entity253 : @entity0 ’s future should not hinge on a decent 32 - year - old journeyman , despite his continued rise			1
@entity176 : a @entity7 goal at last			1
perhaps the next captain , but role must be defined without hurting @entity128 ’s progress			1

@entity0 **'s** final @entity7 game ended with a 0 - 0 draw with @entity155
@entity18 **'s** side were bottom of @entity11 after a miserable tournament
while several young players were blooded in @entity1 , who should @entity18 use in the future ?
some , such as @entity167 and @entity128 , impressed
but which players face a spell in the international exile ?
