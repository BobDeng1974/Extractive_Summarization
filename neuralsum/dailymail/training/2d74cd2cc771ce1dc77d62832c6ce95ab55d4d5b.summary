ticket touts have been accused of ‘ disgusting ’ behaviour after cashing in on a concert to raise money for charity			0
seats for @entity8 ’s @entity7 concerts in aid of the @entity10 sold out within hours of being released - only to appear for resale for more than five times their face value			1
at 9.30am today , all 10,000 tickets for the band ’s two scheduled performances , on 28 and 29 march , were released for sale on the @entity18 website as well as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
all 10,000 tickets for the cure , pictured , who are playing a concert in aid of @entity27 , were sold within hours			1
many were immediately put on secondary ticket selling sites for five times their value the cheapest standing tickets were available for £ 27.50 with the most expensive box seats going for £ 137.50			1
snapped up in fewer than five hours , they immediately reappeared for sale on so - called ‘ secondary ticketing sites ’ , including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( the ticketing arm of @entity40 ) , and @entity41 – which itself is owned by @entity43			1
these sites allow those who have bought tickets to sell them second - hand at a price of their choice			1
the @entity8 tickets were on sale for between £ 149 and £ 330			1
@entity54 , who curated the concerts on behalf of the @entity10 , condemned the touts and called for their behaviour to be made illegal			2
in a statement to the @entity60 , the @entity62 frontman said : ‘ this is a major concern for the live performance arena and it becomes doubly painful when the shows concerned are for charity			0
the people who do this have to live with their consciences , knowing that the profit they have made could have gone to teenagers with cancer			0
‘ he added : ‘ we as a charity do an enormous amount of work to stop this happening			0
we work directly with the bands ’ fan clubs to try and ensure that the real fans acquire the tickets			0
but until it is illegal to transfer tickets for extra money , there really is n’t much more we can do			0
’ meanwhile , fans took to @entity88 to express their rage			0
@entity90 from @entity91 branded the touts ’ behaviour ‘ disgusting ’			0
touts who are attempting to resell the tickets for the gig at the @entity18 ( pictured ) have today been branded ' disgusting ' @entity97 , chief executive of @entity10 said : ‘ it is wrong for individuals to hijack these efforts and personally profit by selling tickets on the secondary market			1
‘ we believe the only people entitled to profit from our event are young people with cancer			0
’ it is not the first time the behaviour of touts using the secondary sites has attracted criticism			2
in november , there was outcry after all 20,000 tickets for @entity117 ’s reunion performance sold out in three - quarters of a minute , only to reappear on the secondary market at more than 15 times their face value			1
ticketing expert @entity120 , of the @entity121 , believes the only way the tickets could have sold out so quickly , only to reappear minutes later , is with the help of illegal , ticket - harvesting ‘ botnet ’ technology - computer programmes which work by inundating ticket providers with thousands of electronic requests at the same time , to buy tickets en masse			1
‘ it is highly likely that some of the methods used to harvest these tickets are illegal			0
the @entity10 event is targeted every year			2
’ some mps have accused the secondary sites of turning a blind eye to illegal behaviour			2
in december , @entity142 mp @entity141 and @entity144 mp @entity143 launched the @entity145 to examine the issue			0
they were due to have their first meeting this week , however all four major ticketing sites declined to send a representative			1
commenting on the @entity8 concert last night , @entity141 said : ‘ ticket touting goes on week in , week out , but it ’s particularly sickening to see the goodwill of an artist and the fundraising efforts of a charity exploited for personal profit			2
‘ fans , the live event industry and even the police have all called on the government to intervene in this shady and parasitical market			0
it ’s high time ministers finally listened , and took action to put fans first			0
’ the @entity8 ’s gigs are part of a week - long series of performances at the @entity18 , curated by @entity54			1
as well as @entity8 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 will all be appearing between march 24 and 30			2
since their launch in 2000 , the @entity10 gigs have raised more than £ 17 million .			2
