by @entity0 on track : a high - speed @entity3 train on its way to @entity5			1
the firm vows to boost its staff by 1,600 by 2017 the firm behind @entity10 ’s famous bullet train is set to move to @entity11 in a major boost for the economy			1
industrial giant @entity3 is planning to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in the country and increase the number of its @entity11 staff from 200 to 1,800 within three years			1
in a highly unusual move for a @entity10 conglomerate , @entity3 has appointed a @entity11 director , @entity19 , to lead its global train business from @entity5			1
@entity21 is also targeting lucrative rail contracts here , including bidding for work on the controversial £ 50billion @entity25 project			1
the manufacturer of the bullet train aims to grow from a business employing 2,500 people today to 4,000 people over the next two and a half years			1
the company ’s biggest train markets around the world are @entity10 , @entity34 and the @entity11 and its annual sales are £ 1.67billion – but the firm plans to increase this to £ 2.5billion over the next few years			1
after the move , which was welcomed last night as ‘ an incredible vote of confidence ’ in @entity11 , the company is likely to use its new @entity11 base to try to win work in @entity44 , taking on rivals including @entity46 – the @entity47 maker of the @entity48 , and the @entity50 giant @entity49			1
@entity3 ’s nuclear arm is also planning to build two power stations – in @entity53 and on @entity54 – after buying the project from its previous owners for £ 700million			0
yesterday ’s announcement comes months after @entity3 said its new factory in @entity59 , @entity60 , would employ more than 700 when it opens next year			0
the site will produce trains to run on the great western line and @entity65 main line after the group won a £ 1.2billion contract			0
the high - tech company will be bidding for work on the controversial @entity25 project in the @entity11 ‘ we see it as a major operation in the @entity11 and we want to build in the @entity11 for the rest of @entity44 , ’ mr @entity19 said yesterday , adding : ‘ both the @entity11 and @entity10 remain important as markets for @entity21			1
‘ with our train factory in the @entity77 of @entity78 now under construction , we will work to realise our export potential from the @entity11			1
‘ it would be a great idea to build high - speed trains in the @entity77			0
’ @entity3 's deal marks a u-turn for its @entity44 boss – who had previously warned that the @entity11 would struggle to attract investment unless it decided to join the euro			1
sir @entity89 has held a number of influential positions within the @entity10 giant ’s @entity44 division , including chief executive and chairman			2
he has been responsible for deals that brought more than £ 1billion of manufacturing to the @entity11			2
but previously , as @entity11 ’s ambassador to @entity10 , he warned @entity98 that foreign firms would abandon the @entity11 unless it could show it was ‘ on track ’ to sign up to the single currency			2
in a memo to the prime minister in 2000 he said @entity11 was ‘ not a safe bet ’ for foreign firms because of its reluctance to ditch the pound in favour of the euro			2
he added : ‘ any sign that the government was backtracking from its timetable could trigger a much stronger move towards disinvestment in the manufacturing sector			0
’ @entity116 , conservative mp for @entity117 , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s @entity59 factory is one of the biggest investments in our area for a generation			0
‘ this a very positive sign as it gives people a lot more confidence that @entity3 is here for the long term			0
’ transport secretary @entity128 added : ‘ this is an incredible vote of confidence in a growing @entity11 that is exporting more and making great things once again			2
‘ nothing says that better than the company that built the first bullet train putting its @entity135 here to sell abroad , alongside a new factory and new jobs in northern @entity78			0
’ and business secretary @entity139 said : ‘ this demonstrates a huge vote of confidence in @entity11 , its workers and its rail industry from one of @entity10 ’s biggest businesses			1
’ chancellor @entity147 also welcomed the move , saying : ‘ for people like me who have grown up with news of manufacturing jobs leaving @entity11 , is n’t it fantastic that manufacturing jobs are coming back to @entity11			2
’ once the envy of the world , @entity11 ’s train - making industry has declined in recent years as manufacturers sought out cheaper options overseas			0
in 2011 the government came under fire for awarding a £ 6billion @entity163 contract to @entity50 - owned @entity49 rather than @entity164 – which at the time ran the @entity11 ’s last train factory in @entity167			0
the move led to the loss of hundreds of @entity11 jobs			0
but @entity164 was given a welcome boost last month after winning a £ 1billion contract to provide trains for @entity174			0
the company will build 65 trains for the @entity178 rail service , which is due to be completed by 2018 .			0

@entity21 vows to increase @entity11 staff from 200 to 1,800 by 2017
