if it is less than 30 degrees it 's a girl , with seven out of ten claiming the technique accurately predicted their baby 's sex			1
meanwhile , six per cent said they tried the ' skull theory ' , with a square skull and jaw said to be a baby boy and a rounder skull a girl			1
but seven out of ten expectant mums use the more traditional method to guess the sex of their baby by the shape of their bump			2
if it is wider it is said to predict a girl , but if the bump protrudes more it could be a boy			2
a third analysed their food cravings and half even tried to predict the gender by how sick they felt			0
