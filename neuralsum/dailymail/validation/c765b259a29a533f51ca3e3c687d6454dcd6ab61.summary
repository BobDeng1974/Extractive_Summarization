@entity10 said he originally planned to shoot the model as he was eating honey , but found it too cliche and planned to scrap the idea			1
that is until he became captivated by the way the substance looked dripping off the man 's hands			1

the honey was shipped in five - pound containers , and was collected to be re-used as it dripped off the models @entity10 said he wanted to use a variety of people with different body types to show how the honey had ' a way of democratizing ' them , transforming the subjects ' in kind of a universal way '			1

because the honey forces the models to shut their eyes , @entity10 said the most important part of the photographs is how they show the subjects ' physical reaction to the act of being covered in the substance			1
' people react different to the experience and that creates the emotion of the picture , ' he told @entity107			0
' those different responses created some of the power in the photos			0

' but then once its on you , you feel warmth coming up , like you feel protected in a way			0

@entity10 first got the idea for his @entity169 when he photographed a ' bear - ish ' man eating honey
he thought the photo cliche , but was captivated with the way honey looked dripping off the man 's hands
he found models of all shapes and sizes , *including* a one - and - a - half year old child , an 85 - year - old woman , and a dog
@entity10 used 1,000lb of honey every week , which was then *reused* on the next model , while shooting the series
one model said she found the substance cold and ' weird feeling ' but then said she felt ' protected in a way '
