the @entity0 is one of @entity3 's most famous buildings			2
designed by @entity5 in 1972 , it caught the world 's attention with its minuscule living spaces for the country 's single office workers			1
the striking tower , in @entity13 's @entity12 district , even appeared as a @entity16 love hotel in 2013 blockbuster ' the @entity18 ' starring @entity19			0
the @entity0 in @entity13 's @entity12 district			0
just 20 of the 140 units are now lived in full - time but over the years much of the once - modern building has fallen into disrepair			1
around half of the 140 units are used as offices , art studios and second homes , but just 20 are lived in full - time			1
each of the 140 units in the tower contains a bed , a fold - out desk and a tiny bathroom , all squeezed just 10 square metres			1
rent for a capsule is around 60,000 yen ( Â£ 337 ) per month			0

the campaign , known as the ' save the @entity100 ' aims to collect donations from people all over the world who love this capsule tower and use that money to buy the capsules one by one			0
