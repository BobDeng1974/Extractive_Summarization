the @entity1 commissioner sir @entity0 , set out claims detectives were bugged by intelligence agencies whose alleged malpractice they probed over the abduction of @entity7 dissidents @entity10 's security and intelligence agencies were last night rocked by claims that they bugged @entity13 detectives who were investigating the agencies ’ own alleged malpractice			1
a @entity13 spokesman yesterday confirmed that police are investigating the allegations – which stem from documents disclosed in court by @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
if substantiated , the claims – set out in a letter to @entity1 commissioner sir @entity0 from @entity25 , a director of the human rights charity reprieve – would mean that one arm of the state supposed to keep the country safe from terrorism spied on another , the @entity1			1
it focuses on the case of two @entity7 dissidents , @entity35 and @entity36 , who were abducted from @entity37 in a joint operation by @entity22 and the @entity39 in 2004 , then sent back to @entity40 ’s @entity7			1
the @entity1 launched @entity41 , an inquiry into their treatment , in 2012 , when documents seized from the @entity7 security hq revealed that @entity10 agencies were partly responsible			1
it is investigating whether @entity10 officials involved in the abduction committed crimes under @entity51 law			1
a preliminary file was sent to the @entity53 in october			0

behind her claims lie documents which emerged in a court hearing last month , at the @entity59 ( @entity59 )			2
in these , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 made the disclosure that in cases such as those of the @entity7 dissidents , they routinely bug lawyer - client conversations			1
@entity66 and solicitors @entity65 are representing mr @entity35 , who in addition to making a criminal complaint , is trying to sue the @entity70			0
the lawyers believe their conversations with him have been bugged , ms @entity25 said yesterday , which means the agencies will also have picked up crucial details of @entity41			0
n her letter , she claims the documents revealed at the @entity59 show the agencies have apparently felt free to ‘ collect communications regarding the evidence that is at the heart of @entity41 ’			2
it adds : ‘ if @entity22 officers ( or others ) intercepted our contacts with police … we are concerned about the safety of potential witnesses and the risk of improper “ tip - offs ”			2
’ ms @entity25 said some witnesses had come forward on terms of strict confidentiality			0
they would ‘ fear for their lives ’ if it turned out the inquiry had been bugged			0
