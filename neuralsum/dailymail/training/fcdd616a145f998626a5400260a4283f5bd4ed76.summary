ultimately , he could n’t see the job through to the end			0
@entity4 ’s dreams of heading to the @entity5 with the ultimate stamp on his cv were dashed by the trauma of a penalty shoot - out at @entity10 on wednesday night			0
at @entity12 , they will perhaps not rue @entity14 ’s exit too much as they prepare for the arrival of a coach who must get things right quickly if the damage of the @entity20 months is to be undone over the course of the new season			1
@entity24 ’s schedule looks rather daunting			1
after a third - place play - off game against @entity26 on saturday , @entity24 will fly back to @entity14 with his squad before heading to @entity28 on tuesday where his wife @entity29 has already found a house in @entity31			1
video : scroll down to see @entity33 and @entity34 excited about new regime at @entity36 fiery : @entity4 on the touchline during the semi-final defeat dejected : @entity24 ca n't hide his disappointment after @entity14 are knocked out @entity41 ca n't wait to get started it is likely that @entity36 will officially unveil the 62 - year - old as their new manager at a press conference in the middle of the week , before @entity24 joins the club ’s squad on a two - week tour of @entity50 that begins next weekend			1
it is understood @entity36 would have granted @entity24 a short break had he felt he needed one , but that the former @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 manager indicated he wished to begin work as soon as possible			1
‘ holidays are for wimps , ’ was the way one @entity36 official put it recently			1
certainly , @entity36 supporters will have been encouraged by what they have seen of their new manager in @entity26			1
the @entity67 has arguably emerged as the outstanding coach of the @entity69			1
@entity20 was criticised for many things during his difficult season at @entity36			1
some of it was unfair but much was n’t			0
accusations of tactical rigidity were certainly understandable and @entity20 occasionally took a peculiar approach to the use of substitutions			0
in @entity24 , @entity36 have a coach willing to change his tactical approach dramatically for individual games and also make big calls during matches			1
we know about the big stories of @entity24 ’s @entity69 : his decision to bring on @entity86 as a specialist penalty - saver for the quarter - final shoot - out against @entity89 ; his use of former @entity92 striker @entity91 as a wing back			1
tough call : @entity24 was not afraid to substitute skipper @entity95 eye to eye : @entity24 and @entity97 talk in training @entity99 july 23 : v @entity100 ( @entity101 , @entity102 ) july 26 : v @entity103 ( @entity104 ) july 29 : v @entity105 ( @entity106 ) august 2 : v @entity107 ( @entity108 , @entity109 ) august 12 : v @entity110 ( @entity12 ) @entity5 august 16 : v @entity111 ( h ) august 23 : v @entity113 ( a ) august 30 : v @entity114 ( a ) @entity24 ’s work went deeper than that , though			1
he was clever enough to make the previously disenfranchised @entity95 his captain earlier in his reign but not afraid to bring the @entity36 striker off — and then explain publicly why — when he was n’t playing well enough			1
equally , he was brave enough to ask @entity14 to play in a withdrawn counter-attacking fashion that flew in the face of @entity14 traditions			0
he did it because he knew his squad was n’t good enough to play any other way			0
‘ @entity129 ’ was how he described this group of players			0
he had a close enough bond with them to get away with that term			0
style can be everything at @entity36 , but @entity24 does not have a reputation as a defensive coach at club level			1
close knit : @entity24 had the full respect of the @entity14 squad there is no reason to suggest he is going to turn up at @entity143 and ask @entity36 to play five across the back			1
he would have to locate three decent central defenders first			0
nevertheless , the ability he has shown to make the most of what he has could be invaluable as he works with a squad that will perhaps not be of the quality he needs until after another couple of transfer windows			0
under sir @entity153 in his later years , @entity36 over-performed			2
under @entity20 , the same players regressed to such an extent as to be almost unrecognisable			0
holding the fort : @entity33 has been taking training in @entity24 's absence 1 ) medals : @entity36 ’s dressing room needs to be impressed after years of success under sir @entity153			1
2 ) confidence : press conferences in the @entity69 would often contain rambling @entity24 soliloquies where he explained the nuances of his tactical genius			2
3 ) players : do n’t be surprised if he brings one or two players from his successful @entity67 @entity69 squad to @entity12 , even if they are for the fringes			1
keep your eye on @entity174 and @entity91			0
4 ) tactics : @entity24 sees himself as one of the game ’s great thinkers			2
that would make him a dull dinner companion — but a talented coach			0
5 ) belief : one of @entity24 ’s great successes in @entity26 was to get his team playing above themselves and believing they could achieve things			1
@entity36 will be hoping for some of that magic dust			2
@entity24 ’s first job is to perhaps find the middle ground between the two and the evidence of this @entity69 suggests he may do that			2
@entity24 ’s control of his players in @entity50 has been interesting			2
his reputation is one of rigidity but he got his players to buy into his methods and to follow him			0
he will need that at @entity36			2
there is something of a ‘ medals on the table ’ culture in @entity36 ’s dressing room			2
the fact @entity206 did n’t have any did for him			0
@entity24 ’s reputation and career will buy him time at @entity36 , although it will be interesting to see if he attempts to ‘ out ’ any of his players as he did here in the wake of wednesday ’s exit			1
he suggested that two of his @entity67 players had n’t fancied a penalty in @entity216			2
it was an odd move that ran contrary to just about everything he has done out here			0
perhaps he could n’t face accepting the blame for the fact he asked a central defender , @entity223 ’s @entity222 , to take the first kick ( @entity222 missed )			0
second thoughts : @entity24 's faith in @entity222 backfired after he missed his penalty kick perhaps he felt he could get away with it because he is leaving the @entity67 set up			1
perhaps he was just a little emotional and regrets it now			0
whatever the case , if he tries that in @entity231 he may find some players in the @entity36 dressing room turn their backs quicker than he ever could have imagined			2
to the neutral , it did at least prove one thing			0
it would appear the ‘ @entity238 ’ is human after all .			0

@entity24 ready to start work at @entity12 within days of return from @entity26
@entity67 heads to @entity28 on tuesday and will be unveiled next week
@entity24 to join @entity36 squad on *pre-season* tour to the @entity246
