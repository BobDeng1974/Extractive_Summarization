@entity2 has been saving for almost a year to fly with her son @entity11 to @entity12 , @entity13 , on wednesday - but he still has no travel documents , putting the whole holiday in jeopardy			1
however , despite ms @entity2 , 23 , from @entity18 , first applying for his passport on may 15 , the @entity17 has now promised the document will be ready in time			1
ms @entity2 booked the trip for seven family members almost a year ago because she knew she would have to miss her mother 's wedding , which took place in term time			1
so the 23 - year - old carer , her son @entity4 and daughter @entity29 - @entity30 planned to hold a belated celebration along with her mother , sister , brother - in - law and nephew			1
on may 15 she attempted to apply for a passport online for @entity4 , whose travel documents had expired			2
but the @entity39 told her there were technical problems with her online application , and they would have to send her a paper declaration form in the post			1
she asked them to do so - but it took two weeks to arrive , she said			2
ms @entity2 said she returned it immediately , but since then she has had to wait another three weeks			1
now there are just days left before the trip , which cost £ 900 for ms @entity2 and her children			1
she said : ' my mum got married in @entity13 in may and we could n’t go because the kids were in school			2
' so we booked this as close to the school holidays as possible and i have saved all year for it			0
' i have just been calling and calling ... i ca n’t understand how someone can promise this and then not ring us			2
' it is so frustrating			0
i can not stop crying and @entity4 is so upset			1
nobody has told us anything			0
' devastated : @entity4 pictured with ( from left ) his sister @entity65 , mother @entity2 , cousin @entity66 and aunt @entity67 @entity4 's mother said : ' i was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been			1
he has been counting down the days ' @entity4 was due to meet several members of his new grandfather 's family , who are all from @entity13 , for the first time and is now distraught			1
' i could not leave him , ' said his mother			2
' it is just awful , if i have to stay at home my daughter will also miss out on a holiday but we are not going to leave him			0
' it is tearing the family apart			0
' i was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been			0
he has been counting down the days			0
' since ms @entity2 's dilemma appeared in her local newspaper the @entity89 , however , the family have been offered a possible reprieve			1
they have been contacted by the @entity39 and told @entity4 's travel documents will hopefully be ready on monday to be picked up from an office in @entity94			1
chaos : pictures leaked to @entity97 last month showed hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a @entity39 in @entity94 , piling pressure on the government to introduce emergency measures it is a 350 - mile round trip - but ms @entity2 said it would be worth it to end the chaos			1
the @entity39 said it was ' working to ensure ' all customers receive their official documents within the expected timeframe but said it was also ' doing everything possible to speed up the system '			2
a spokesman said : ' it is not unusual during peak periods for @entity116 to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time , with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years			0
' we are working to ensure that our customers receive their passports within our service standards and are determined to do everything possible to speed up the system , while maintaining the security of the passport			0
' the home secretary has announced a series of additional measures to ensure people and families receive their passports in good time for their summer holidays			0
these include bringing in extra staff and extending opening hours to seven days a week			0
' we have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently , including free upgrades and extensions on the passports of overseas customers			0
' the case is just one of tens of thousands caught up in a huge passport backlog which emerged last month , when photos were leaked of stacks of orange binders in the @entity94 processing centre			0
the revelation prompted an apology in the @entity152 from home secretary @entity153			0
speaking on june 18 , mrs may said 11 per cent of applications were being processed within three weeks - the target waiting time			2
