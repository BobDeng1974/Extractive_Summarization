another night in @entity0 , another disappointment for @entity2			1
@entity3 , @entity4 ... the name on the manager ’s door does not seem to matter when it comes to the holy grail of the @entity10			1
so why is it that the champions of @entity14 struggle when they head into @entity0 ? @entity15 takes a look at five reasons			0
playing in a library whisper this in the blue corner of @entity21 , but @entity22 came alive on @entity0 nights			0
@entity25 fans were often criticised for their decibel levels in the @entity27 but the prawn sandwich brigade were drowned out in the @entity10			1
yes , group matches against lesser rivals can be a tedious , pointless and heavy drain on the wallet but not when @entity34 giants @entity33 are in town , surely			1
six wins out of six , joint top of the table , and @entity40 ’s first return to @entity14 as a tasty side dish			2
not enough for the home supporters , apparently			0
@entity2 failed to sell out their crucial @entity10 game against @entity33 on tuesday night by contrast @entity33 were handed a huge lift by their packed away end rammed with passionate supporters a half - empty @entity48 certainly did not impress @entity49 , @entity25 legend turned tv pundit			1
‘ they 've got the team , they 've definitely got the players , the quality is definitely there , but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition ? i do n't think they do , ’ was the damning verdict from @entity49			2
busy tweeter @entity62 posed the question : ‘ would fans rather watch @entity65 ? ’ ouch			0
double ouch given the @entity25 leanings			0
not even the @entity21 return of @entity40 could rouse the fans to turn up in their droves misfiring strikers four goals in the two games leading up to this one meant that expectations were high for @entity76 but he found the @entity33 defence a step up from @entity79 and , er , @entity80			1
the @entity83 can be infuriatingly inconsistent , which is why his @entity2 career includes so many substitute appearances			1
he was clearly disappointed when he was taken off for @entity87 but with @entity89 coming back from injury , this was @entity76 ’s chance to show why he should be first choice when all the forwards are up and running			0
credit should go to @entity33 ’s defenders , too			1
they have only conceded three goals all season and tuesday night ’s was from the penalty spot			1
@entity99 was the scorer but that was the high point			2
the @entity101 has five goals in eight games this season but did not look anything like the deadly menace he was for most of the last campaign until his thigh and hamstring problems started			0
he is a player of sublime quality but needed to show it against @entity33			2
@entity76 is sometimes infuriating to watch when he leads the line for @entity4 's side no - no for @entity115 last season ’s player of the year is another who appears to have taken several steps backwards since the summer			1
rather like @entity120 at @entity121 , @entity115 is the go - to player when things are going wrong on the pitch			2
he can break up play , he can pick a forward pass and he can gallop forwards and score blinders			0
but that ’s when he is on form			0
whether it is the speculation of his departure after the ‘ birthday cake affair ’ , or whether it is an emotional hangover from the death of his brother – which would be quite understandable – @entity115 is not making his usual impact			0
@entity33 were ripped apart by injuries on tuesday night so it could have been @entity115 ’s stage			1
he did not take the opportunity			0
@entity115 has struggled with his performances since a summer of discontent at the @entity48 @entity143 stares at the floor after @entity145 equalised for the @entity147 visitors it was a mistake by @entity143 to allow @entity145 through on goal before he sublimely finished beyond @entity150 @entity152 sighs @entity153 had this game down as a must - win , which meant he had to look for creators who could unpick the @entity147 lock			1
full backs @entity159 – a flop at the @entity48 and made to look a dummy by @entity162 four years ago – and veteran @entity40 would have been targeted , pre-match as possible weak links			0
yes @entity159 conceded the penalty , for which he was booked , but that apart the @entity165 looked a player transformed from his @entity2 experience			1
@entity168 was comfortable in his role			0
@entity170 was so bad that he only lasted 45 minutes while fellow @entity172 @entity171 gave his all but could not find the creative spark which was required			0
@entity170 was hooked at half - time after struggling to exert himself on the game from the start @entity159 was seen as a weak link before the fixture but had a superb game rampaging forward from the back leaving @entity182 on the bench a galaxy of talented foreigners on the pitch , two dyed - in - the - wool , no - nonsense @entity14 players sitting on the bench			2
yet when @entity87 and @entity190 were finally let loose , @entity2 started to re-discover their drive			2
@entity87 is one of those players who gets an unfair press – just look at the managers who have selected him for club and country			2
in ice - cream terms , he is vanilla			2
no frills , no chocolate topping , but utterly reliable as he showed that again on tuesday night			1
as for @entity190 , @entity202 boy is enjoying his own indian summer since his departure from @entity205 and was the manager ’s pick to replace @entity76			0
had those two been on from the start , dictating the tempo and added some @entity14 grit , who knows what might have happened against a @entity33 side who had key players out , including @entity216			1
and before anyone brings up thirty - something @entity190 ’s age , think @entity145 , 38			1
like @entity221 's facebook page			0
goalscoring midfielder @entity190 was only let loose on proceedings just before the hour - mark video plenty of points still to play for - @entity226			0

@entity2 could only draw 1 - 1 against @entity33 on tuesday night
the @entity10 is proving a troubling competition for the club
@entity4 's side took the lead through a @entity99 penalty
but @entity145 equalised for the visitors
