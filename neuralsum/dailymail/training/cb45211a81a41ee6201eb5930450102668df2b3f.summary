it was a moment that even the strong - willed @entity1 must have doubted would ever arrive			1
more than eight years after a @entity4 bomb shattered his body , the extraordinary soldier has walked unsupported for the first time			1
after four weeks being treated with pressurised oxygen , @entity8 ’s seemingly dead nerves and muscles are regenerating like something out of science fiction			2
his speech is clearer , he is regaining control and use of his left arm and , astonishingly , tiny bits of shrapnel embedded since 2006 have been emerging from his body			0
his mother @entity33 , 57 , said : ‘ we could count about 20 changes in the past month – some big , some small			2
what ’s happening is astounding			0
’ the most seriously injured soldier to survive in @entity38 , he lost both his legs and broke his back , hips and ribs , as well as suffering brain damage , when his @entity44 hit a mine			1
he was unconscious in a military hospital for three months			0
treatment : the 30 - year - old war hero is one of the first soldiers in @entity49 to be given the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , which works to rebuild his tissues and muscles the procedure involves sitting in a huge metal cylinder for up to two hours , during which time the patient breathes in pressurised pure oxygen @entity1 underwent the treatment for six days a week over the course of the month			1
by the third week , he had taken the steps unaided and his speech is also said to be ' rapidly improving ' fighter : the inspirational former soldier ( pictured left and right before the bomb blast ) has also regained the feeling in his legs for the first time since the incident eight years ago probably the most significant moment in @entity70 ’s long journey back from the brink came last week at the @entity72 in @entity73			1
@entity1 ’s astonishing progress may help convince the medical establishment of the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy , still regarded with suspicion by many doctors			1
patients breathe oxygen through a mask in a chamber at twice atmospheric pressure			0
oxygen is a key part of the healing process , helping repair and regenerate tissue and cells and reducing inflammation			2
professor @entity91 , an expert in hyperbaric medicine at the @entity93 , says there is overwhelming evidence that brain cells can be revived and stem cells stimulated to grow new nerve cells			0
oxygen therapy is cheap – with chambers costing as little as £ 45 a session – and as well being used to treat injured soldiers could help stroke patients recover			2
there were tears from him and his mother when he walked ‘ three or four steps completely unsupported ’ in the clinic ’s gym after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and putting himself through eight gruelling hours of physiotherapy a day			1
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ he got us all up one night saying he ’d awoken because he could feel all the nerves in his legs wake up			0
it has been incredibly emotional			0
’ he has now returned home to @entity118 but will continue with his treatment at a chamber in @entity121			1
previously he could walk on his false legs only in a style that meant he would never be free of crutches			0
the development of muscles and movement in his hips has enabled him to walk in a rocking style like other amputees			2
this progress is only the start			0
experts hope that in the coming months there will be signs the oxygen therapy is repairing @entity1 ’s brain damage , which has affected his memory and speech			1
mrs @entity33 , who found out about the therapy on the internet , said : ‘ @entity1 is absolutely over the moon with his progress so far			2
we hope that eventually @entity1 ’s brain will recover			0
it ’s done wonders for the rest of his body so far so you never know			0
’ @entity1 was injured in 2006 when the @entity44 in which he was travelling hit a mine in @entity151 wounded : @entity1 , pictured left at @entity152 , and right with his mother @entity153 and brother @entity154 torch : @entity1 was chosen to carry the @entity157 flame in the torch relay , reflecting his incredible attitude to rebuilding his life			1
