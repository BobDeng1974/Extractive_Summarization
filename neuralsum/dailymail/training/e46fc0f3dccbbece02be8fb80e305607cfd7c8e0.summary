his dentist , @entity22 in @entity23 said it does not have the expertise to solve the problem			2
but after waiting months for an appointment at specialist hospital , the @entity28 , mr @entity7 said he was told to go back to his normal surgery			1
no sooner than he did that was he referred back to the @entity32 hospital again			2
the 79 - year - old said he believes his was an emergency case , because he was starting to suffer other health problems as a result of his inability to eat			2
a letter from a dentist at @entity22 to @entity28 , said : ' it is beyond my ability to provide mr @entity7 with a suitable new implant retained denture			1
' thus , i am referring him for diagnosis and treatment as you see appropriate			0
' mr @entity7 said it is now more than two years since he began asking dentists for help			2
' they have n't done the job they should have done , ' he said			0
' they 've done two repairs which lasted only a few days and now they 're not prepared to see me for another six months			0
' i feel very neglected			0
i have paid into the system all my life			0

calls to the patient advice service @entity92 and his mp have failed to bring any assistance			0

' unfortunately the original o - rings for his implant system are no longer available			0
