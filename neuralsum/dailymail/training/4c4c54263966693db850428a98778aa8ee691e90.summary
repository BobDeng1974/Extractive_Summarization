it is more than 20 years since the original ratings hit was axed but the @entity13 says a new version is in development , but with a younger @entity16			0
@entity4 bosses are eager to copy the success of @entity20 's @entity19 , which follows the career of the young @entity22			1
a spokesman told @entity24 the new show is in development , but has not yet been commissioned			0
insiders say it wants to make the drama more appealing to a younger audience rather than the more middle - aged market who watched it decades ago the original @entity2 starred @entity5 as the title character , a casually dressed detective with a vintage sports car solving crimes against the sunny backdrop of the @entity39			1
it ran for a decade on the @entity4 from 1981 to 1991			2
after it ended , @entity5 went on to star in the highly successful @entity42 series on @entity20			2
