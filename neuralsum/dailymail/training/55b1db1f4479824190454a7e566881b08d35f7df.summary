@entity0 may be at the centre of a row involving @entity3 but you would n't know it from looking at him			1
the @entity7 legend was all smiles during a club promotional event in the @entity10 on friday and seemingly looked like he did n't have a care in the world			1
that 's despite the fact the 39 - year - old was criticized by @entity3 on thursday for claiming the @entity17 striker was a fading force who faces being dropped for the @entity20			1
but @entity3 has pointed out that his former @entity7 team - mate has been little more than a peripheral figure at the club recently - only returning to the coaching staff when @entity33 was made caretaker boss in april			1
‘ he ’s been a team - mate but he ’s been away from the first team for a long time , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i ’ve seen a lot of people saying he ’s coached me and been around the team but he has n’t			2
angered : @entity3 ( centre ) has hit back at criticism from @entity7 legend @entity0 ‘ i ’m not really going to react			1
he ’s got his opinions so let ’s leave it at that			2
to be honest i ’m not really interested in what anyone else has got to say			2
‘ i ’m interested in what @entity48 and the coaching staff here and the people around me say			2
people have their opinions but i do n’t agree with them			2
’ @entity56 ’ comments opened a debate which was fuelled when @entity48 decided to play @entity3 on the left wing against @entity59 on wednesday			1
doubt : @entity0 ( left ) has questioned whether @entity3 is still the force he used to be @entity3 , who missed the end of the @entity64 season with a groin problem , is the only outfield player to start both of @entity17 ’s warm - up games			1
he scored their opener in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity59 in @entity71 , his first international goal since october			1
‘ i can play in different positions , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i ’ve proved i can play on the left over the years			2
the manager did n’t have to tell me what to do			0
i know how to play that role			0
i ’ve played it many times and i ’ve no problem doing that			0
he did n’t have to explain it to me			0
‘ it is down to the manager			0
it ’s not about me , it ’s about the team			2
if the manager wants to play me up top , in behind , left , right , i ’m happy to do that			0
‘ i ’m ready to play			0
i hope to play against @entity27			0
i ’ve trained hard , i have no injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain i had at the end of the season			0
‘ i always needed game time			2
i felt really good , especially in the heat			0
i ’m sure the manager will have a tough decision but i ’m ready			0
’ together : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 have been team - mate for both @entity17 and @entity7 opener : @entity3 ( right ) scores @entity17 's first goal against @entity59 on wednesday @entity3 and @entity98 may need to refine their partnership if they are to play in tandem , as they did in the 3 - 0 win against @entity105 on saturday			1
but the @entity7 striker pointed out : ‘ i think in every game we ’ve played together , one of us has scored			1
’ his facts are slightly skewed			0
the strikers have scored five between them in seven appearances together			0
@entity98 , rested against @entity59 , has scored in his last two @entity17 games — against @entity114 and @entity105			1
@entity3 said : ‘ @entity98 ’s a fantastic player			1
he can score goals from anywhere , like he did at @entity117			0
‘ we have trained a lot together so hopefully we can take that form into the tournament			0
’ wide boy : @entity3 ( left ) played on the left of midfield against @entity59 dangerous duo : @entity98 and @entity3 have scored five goals in seven appearances together @entity128 yesterday added his voice to those calling for @entity3 to start in the @entity20			1
the former @entity7 manager said : ‘ he has to play			1
he has the ability to score , he has the mental strength to handle the games			0
in those games you look to your big players and @entity3 will be a big player for @entity17			1
‘ but there is an awful lot of pressure being lumped on him , which is n’t right			0
@entity17 have n’t done particularly well in a lot of competitions , so no one should be expecting great things from them			1
' to be a stand - out and make a difference in @entity20 games is very hard			1
for me , @entity3 would definitely start			1
he has the experience of past tournaments			0
’ in charge : @entity17 boss @entity48 must decide where is best to play @entity3 against @entity154 ‘ i think he is in a better place than he was this time last year			1
‘ he is playing well and his form has been good and i do think he has already come out and said he wants to have a good @entity20 - you have to trust him and go with that			2
‘ he will be determined to do well			0
he knows how important this is for him			0
@entity3 will be desperate to show everyone what he can do			2
‘ in his mind , he is strong and he will be determined to go out and show how good he is , with a determination to do the job			0
but you have to remember that the opposition can make it difficult for players as well			0
‘ he will also need good service and good players around him			0
@entity3 can not make it happen all on his own			2
’ backing : former @entity7 boss @entity128 has called for @entity3 to start at the @entity20			1
