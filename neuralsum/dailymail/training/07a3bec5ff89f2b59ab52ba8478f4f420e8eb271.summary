a copy of a 600 - year - old map found in a second - hand book shop is the key to proving that the @entity4 , not @entity5 , were the first to discover the @entity6 , a controversial @entity8 historian claims			1
the document is purportedly an 18th century copy of a 1418 map charted by @entity4 admiral @entity12 , which appears to show the @entity6 in some detail			1
this purported evidence that a @entity4 sailor mapped the @entity17 more than seven decades before @entity5 is just one of @entity20 - shattering claims that author @entity21 makes in his new book ‘ who discovered @entity24 ? ’ - out today , just in time for the @entity26 holiday			1
‘ the traditional story of @entity5 discovering the @entity6 is absolute fantasy , it ’s fairy tales , ’ mr @entity21 told @entity27			1
mr @entity21 believes that this portion of the map depicts the @entity4 mapping of @entity24 in 1418 - showing major rivers			1
explorer : @entity4 admiral @entity12 is known to have sailed the to @entity36 and @entity37 with a massive fleet of ships			1
historian @entity21 says he also reached the @entity6 among @entity21 other claims are that the first inhabitants of the @entity17 did n’t come over land from the @entity43 , but instead were @entity4 sailors who first crossed the @entity45 40,000 years ago			1
he also writes that @entity47 markers prove @entity49 @entity48 and other natives are the descendants of several waves of @entity53 settlers			0
furthermore , he says a majestic fleet of @entity4 ships , commanded by @entity12 , sailed around the continent of @entity24 - 100 years before @entity57 supposedly became the first the undertake the task			1
@entity5 features heavily in the book - insofar as @entity21 has devoted the last 20 years to finding and laying out evidence that @entity5 not only did n’t discover @entity24 - he was 40 millenia late			1
mr @entity21 believes that @entity5 actually had a map of the world that was plotted by the @entity4 admiral @entity12 , who created the map when he sailed to the @entity6 in 1421 , more than seven decades before @entity5			1
mr @entity21 believes that this portion of the map depicts the @entity4 mapping of @entity24 in 1418 - showing major rivers			1
his book includes what @entity21 says is a copy of that map			2
discovered by @entity74 attorney @entity73 in a second - hand bookshop that he says proves his theory			0
the document , he says , is an 18th century copy of admiral @entity12 's 1417 map			1
mr @entity21 argues that it clearly shows @entity49 rivers and coasts , as well as the continent of @entity24			2
mr @entity86 's assertion about @entity12 's voyage to the @entity6 is n't new - he first wrote about it in 2002 - but the map is			2
mr @entity73 had the map authenticated by an appraiser from @entity92 , who said that the document was ' very old ' and was not a newly - made fake			0
after mr @entity73 brought the map forward , @entity21 also had a team of historians analyze every word on it			2
he concluded that it was originally written in the @entity101 - a @entity4 period that lasted from 1368 to 1644			0
in the region of the map that mr @entity21 believes refers to @entity105 are written the inscriptions - ' here the people practiced the religion of @entity109 ' and ' here the people practice human sacrifice ' - clear references peoples known to have inhabited @entity105 at the time			0
the map is further corroborated , mr @entity21 says , by the @entity4 names of numerous towns and regions in @entity105			2
he says old @entity105 maps show places with names like @entity121 - @entity4 for ' land prepared for sowing ' and @entity124 - ' wood or forest			0
' @entity126 - a remote @entity105 town at the bottom of a ravine translates to ' difficult passage			0
' controversial : @entity21 , 76 , has been arguing for more than a decade that the @entity4 and other @entity131 discovered the @entity132			1
' who discovered @entity24 ? - due out today - is his fourth book on the topic mr @entity21 calls the story that @entity5 ' discovered @entity24 in 1492 a ' fairy tale ' - saying he was not only not the first explorer - he was 40,000 years late mr @entity21 has no formal training as a historian and no advanced degree from a major university - he was a submariner in the @entity144 - but he can no longer be called an ‘ amateur			1
’ ‘ who discovered @entity24 ? ’ is @entity86 ’s fourth book in which he tries to re-write history and orient it @entity148			1
he has plowed millions of dollars of his proceeds from his books into continuing his world - traveling research into his theories			0
he has turned his north @entity156 home into a de facto research institute , employing up to six research assistants at a time			0
but his theories are not accepted by the mainstream academic community			0
in 2008 , @entity161 history professor @entity160 told the @entity162 that his books are ' the historical equivalent of stories about @entity165 in ( the supermarket ) and close encounters with alien hamsters			0
' even @entity169 characterizes @entity21 as a ' pseudo-historian			2
' that has not stopped him from gaining millions of readers - and thousands of followers who contribute to his website and contribute research of their own			0
menzies say this map of the @entity179 province of @entity105 shows numerous @entity4 names of villages each of these dots represents a @entity105 town that reportedly has a @entity4 name			0
it is claimed this is evidence of @entity4 colonization before @entity5 mr @entity21 debuted his @entity131 - centric theories with 2002 's ' 1421 : the @entity190 discovered the @entity6			1
' in it , he said that the famed @entity4 sailor admiral @entity12 , who is known to have reached @entity36 and @entity37 , also crossed the @entity45 to the @entity17			1
he claims that @entity12 not only reached the @entity6 , he left colonies there			1
his fleet also sailed around the tip of @entity24 - through the @entity197 around the @entity198 and up the @entity199			2
there is evidence , both archaeological and genetic , @entity21 says , that @entity12 left his mark in @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and even the @entity206 of @entity207			2
in ' who discovered @entity24 ? ' @entity21 focuses on theories that @entity131 also made it to @entity24 by sea long before even @entity12			1
' it appears certain that man reached the @entity24 by sea at least forty thousands years ago , ' @entity21 writes			2
this @entity216 map was made from information brought back from @entity4 by @entity218 and @entity219			0
mr @entity21 says it shows @entity24 and @entity221 - upside - down , oriented with north at the bottom ' doubtless this date will be continuously pushed back , probably to 100,000 @entity224 , which was when the first peoples sailed the @entity226 to @entity227 and ( separately ) in the south from @entity131 to @entity229			2
' most scientists believe man first widely populated the @entity17 13,000 to 16,500 years ago			0
the almost universally - held theory among academics is that man came to the @entity6 by crossing the @entity43 land - bridge between @entity131 and @entity49			0
' the more i thought about the @entity43 theory of populating the @entity24 , the more ridiculous it became , ' mr @entity21 writes about his investigation of the topic mr @entity21 says the idea that man was able to cross the @entity45 around 40,000 @entity224 is n't nearly as dramatic as it seems			1
' if you just go out in a plastic bath tub , the currents will just carry you there , ' he told @entity27			0
' they just came with the current , it ’s as simple as that			0
' he added : ' there ’s nothing terribly remarkable about			0
man has been seafaring for vastly longer than convention credit has given them credit for			0

@entity21 , a @entity8 historian , claims @entity259 admiral @entity12 set up colonies and sailed round @entity24 before @entity5
@entity21 ' new book , ' who discovered @entity24 ? ' also claims the @entity4 have been sailing to the @entity6 since 40,000 *bc* across the @entity45
