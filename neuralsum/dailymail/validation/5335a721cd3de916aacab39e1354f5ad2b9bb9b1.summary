@entity0 will come through this , but he is playing like he has the handbrake on			0
is he being overcoached ? @entity0 was substituted at half - time in the 2 - 1 @entity5 quarter - final loss against @entity6 at @entity7			1
what has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for @entity12 ? he is only 19 and he will come again , but the player @entity14 signed for £ 30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch			0
@entity0 has struggled to recapture his @entity12 form at @entity14 @entity0 was taken off by @entity14 manager @entity21 during half - time against @entity6 @entity0 has not progressed in a similar manner to his former @entity12 team - mate @entity24 ( right ) he is n’t doing that now			1
it looks to me as if he ’s thinking too much and that will be down to him trying to carry out instructions			0
@entity0 is going to be a star , but when you consider how @entity24 is developing , why is n’t @entity0 doing the same ? he is a young man , who has had his injuries , but he is struggling and was taken off at half - time in a reshuffle that ultimately did n’t pay off .			2

@entity0 was substituted at half - time as @entity6 beat @entity36
the 19 - year - old has struggled since arriving at @entity14 from @entity12
his former @entity12 team - mate , @entity24 , has progressed *rapidly*
