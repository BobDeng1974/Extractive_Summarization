when it comes to producing the centerpiece for the ideal @entity4 lunch , @entity0 knows the worst thing you can do is rush the process			2
indeed , as her aunt used to tell her , if a turkey is to be just right for the @entity11 , they must have ‘ tasted the april dew ’			2
sadly , of the ten million turkeys that will be consumed in @entity15 over the next couple of weeks , the vast majority will have done nothing of the sort			1
in that time , their weight will have ballooned , piling breast meat on at such a rate that , by the end of the process , they struggle to walk			2
but alongside cheap , mass - produced turkeys , consumers can choose one with a bit of history — and taste			1
about a million birds sold this year will be free range			1
and top of the pecking order are two traditional breeds			0
in one corner of the coop is the @entity22 , a turkey that mrs @entity0 , 75 , and her family pretty much saved from extinction in @entity15			1
in the other is the @entity49 , another old - fashioned breed that is also only here thanks to the foresight of another farming family			0
originally called ' @entity53 ' the turkeys name was changed to reflect the area where they are reared both have vocal champions among the foodie elite who believe the end product more than justifies the cost — £ 14 - plus a kilo rather than £ 5 a kilo for a standard supermarket bird			2
the breeds trace their lineage back to the turkeys brought back to @entity69 by 16th - century visitors to the @entity71			2
the @entity72 was immediately popular , its name changing to the @entity22 to reflect where it was largely reared			1
for the next 300 years the bird would be the mainstay of turkey production until superseded by the bronze turkey ( a name reflecting its bronze - tinted plumage )			0
the bronze was slightly heavier , with a bigger breast			0
as a result , by the @entity83 the @entity22 had almost vanished			1
that it did not is largely due to mrs @entity0 ’s father , @entity85 , part of a family that had been breeding turkeys in @entity22 since the 1880s			1
responding to a request from the local government poultry adviser , he agreed to hatch out a few @entity22 eggs			1
in the @entity95 his birds performed well in industry competitions			2
realising the potential , mr @entity85 got rid of his other breeds and concentrated on the @entity22			1
meanwhile , the bronze turkey was going out of fashion			0
when a ‘ bronze ’ is plucked , stubble - like black feathers can be left behind			0
the public did not like this , so the feather colour was bred out of the bird			0
with a white - feathered turkey , any quills left behind can not be so easily seen			0
‘ the bronze went out of fashion and the white came in , so all the breeding and genetic development was done on the white turkey , ’ says @entity109 , 51 , the man behind the @entity49			0
‘ it has got to the stage when they kill the turkey at the right weight rather than when it is right to eat			0
thus , it has a reputation for being dry and tasteless			0
’ to this background , in 1971 mr @entity109 ’s father @entity123 , a farmer from @entity124 , @entity125 , realised there was room in the market for a proper , old - fashioned turkey			0
the @entity131 ( pictured ) can be cooked quickly , taking just a couple of hours for the average sized bird all @entity49 birds sold this year — some 34,000 — will be reared on one of the @entity109 ’s @entity125 farms or by of their accredited farmers across the country			1
one reason that traditional breeds such as the @entity22 and @entity49 taste better is because they take twice as long to reach their slaughter weight			1
‘ they are free range , we grow them for 27 weeks , and they are then dry - plucked by hand , ’ says mr @entity109			1
‘ this enables them to be hung for 14 days			0
all this creates a great - tasting bird			0
’ the same efforts go into producing the @entity22 that i buy online from a farm in @entity22 ( the 1,000 - plus birds reared by mrs @entity0 ’s son @entity158 have already sold out )			1
again , it has been roaming free for 24 weeks and hung for more than a week after slaughter			1
‘ the shape of the @entity22 is more like a pheasant , they are a sort of single - breasted bird , ’ says mrs @entity0			1
‘ the @entity22 has a much tighter , firmer meat and therefore keeps the flavour and the moisture			1
’ both birds come with detailed cooking instructions , which are remarkably similar			2
the @entity49 is to be cooked ‘ quickly ’ — ‘ an average - size turkey will take just over a couple of hours to cook to perfection ’			0
as with the @entity22 , it is suggested the bird is cooked breast down to allow the fat on its back to trickle through to the breast and keep it moist			1
foil is advised against — it causes the skin to steam rather than go crisp — as is stuffing , which slows down the cooking times			0
for a 5kg bird , two hours and 15 minutes at a temperature of 180c , or gas mark 4 , is recommended			0
the @entity22 will cook in a similar time , albeit after an initial blast in a hotter oven			1
after cooking , it is important to let the birds rest so the juices can settle : 20 minutes for the @entity22 , up to an hour for the @entity49			1
mr @entity195 got rid of his other breeds in the fifties after realising how successful the @entity22 had become once cooked and sitting side - by - side , they look remarkably appetising			1
i cut into the breast of the @entity49 and am impressed not just by how moist it is , but by the firm texture of the meat			0
it also has great taste			2
the same goes for the @entity22			2
if anything it has more flavour , slightly gamey , which i find even more appealing			0
in the past , i have struggled to muster much enthusiasm for the @entity4 turkey			0
how could something that takes so long to prepare , taste of so little ? that ’s not a problem with these birds			2
but are they worth the additional cost ? given the care that ’s gone into growing them , and the finished result , i think they are .			0

ten million turkeys will be consumed in @entity15 over the next few weeks
about a million birds sold this year will be free range
consumers can now choose birds with a bit of history and taste
the @entity22 and @entity233 are popular choices
