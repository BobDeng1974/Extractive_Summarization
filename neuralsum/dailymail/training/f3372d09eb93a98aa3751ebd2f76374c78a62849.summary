@entity0 has been in superb form for @entity2 this season , scoring goals and winning the hearts of @entity2 supporters with his all - action displays			1
the 21 - year - old netted twice in his side 's 5 - 3 victory against @entity11 on @entity12 but , as @entity13 of 90min.com tells us , it 's not just his goals which have endeared @entity0 to the @entity17 faithful			1
5.50pm , thursday january 1			2
@entity11 lead @entity2 1 - 0 , the natural order of things is in place and @entity0 is about to be shut out by another top - class defence			1
spurs have beaten @entity11 5 - 3 , @entity0 has scored twice , bagged an assist and been fouled for a penalty			1
he 's a @entity2 legend			1
that might sound a little harsh on the 21 - year - old , since he 's been making fans around @entity17 sit up and take notice all season , but it 's only been in the last month or two that he 's got his league chances			1
and boy , has he taken them			0
@entity2 striker @entity0 ( left ) unleashes a powerful effort at goal to make it 1 - 1 against @entity11 @entity0 celebrates after scoring the first of his two goals against @entity41 's side on @entity12 i was having a conversation with another @entity2 fan last season , when @entity0 was being started ahead of @entity46 and @entity47 by @entity48 , and we both came to the same conclusion - @entity0 would be one of the most popular players at the club , if only he was actually worth his place in the side			1
@entity55 , as he must now surely be known , is the perfect ' club man '			0
he 's a local boy , growing up only a few miles from the ground and a story about him shirking training would be more shocking than 10,000 volts straight to the eyeballs			0
his heart and soul are in the team , but he always lacked an edge			0
it 's fair to say that , as 2014 came to a close , he found his edge			0
@entity69 under 21 striker @entity0 guides his shot past @entity71 for his second goal of the game @entity74 gives @entity0 a hug after the former @entity77 youngster had given @entity2 a 4 - 1 lead against @entity11 it 's not just the sudden explosion of raw talent and terrifying bursts forward that have thrust him into the limelight - only one man covered more distance than @entity0 's 11.35km at @entity17 on thursday			1
if @entity0 was like another excellent @entity2 striker of recent years , @entity88 , this would be a different situation			1
@entity88 was easy to like , sure			0
easy to admire , too			0
but his lazy style and aloofness tended to keep him one step removed from the fans			0
@entity0 's constant running and tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve , though , changes things			1
suddenly , he 's one of us			0
when his form drops off - and it will , nobody can keep this scoring rate up forever - it wo n't be through lack of interest or effort			2
@entity0 , pictured tussling with @entity11 's @entity106 , has impressed supporters with his effort and desire it 's the same reason that another man in the news this week has become a legend at his club			1
sometimes @entity115 plays badly , but it 's never because he does n't care			0
that 's comforting for fans			2
that 's the kind of dedication that inspires love from fans towards players			2
i do n't love @entity0 for his goals			2
the goals are just a by - product of the reason that i and so many other @entity2 fans love him			1
we love him for his heart			0
and we love him because when he 's out on the pitch , he 's showing us how much he loves us back			2
