the @entity0 is struggling to assert president @entity2 's relevance as drowning @entity3 have had to decide between defending him and throwing him under their campaign buses			1
several liberals in tough re-election fights have opted , @entity9 - like , to deny him three times before @entity12 's cock can crow			1
@entity13 , @entity16 's embattled @entity15 @entity14 , put his finger on what his party 's bigger names are grappling with , saying that while he voted for @entity2 in 2008 and 2012 , ' that 's irrelevant			1
the president 's not relevant			2
he 's gone in two years			2
' it ’s where we are today , it ’s the next six years			0
he ’s gone in two			0
' ' whoever ’s the next @entity56 senator will be dealing with a new president			0
that ’s the bottom line			0
' the @entity0 fired back on thursday after that report appeared in the @entity60			2
' i did n’t see those comments , ' @entity2 's press secretary @entity61 said improbably			2
' the vast majority of @entity56 would agree that that whoever the sitting @entity65 happens to be is relevant in a lot of important ways			1
' even the party 's chairwoman , @entity71 rep. @entity69 , is putting space between herself and the @entity73			0
she needs to win re-election , too			0
asked on the @entity76 ' program if voters who support @entity3 congressional candidates on nov. 4 will be symbolically backing the president , @entity69 insisted he 's is not an @entity12 issue			1
' @entity2 was on the ballot in 2012 and 2008 , ' she said			2
true enough , but his policies are on the ballot			0
the president ensured his relevance , at least in the cutthroat @entity15 campaigns that will determine who runs @entity89 in 2015 and 2016 , by insisting during an oct. 2 speech that his ' policies are on the ballot ' in november , ' every single one of them			0
' @entity94 , @entity2 's longtime political savant , told @entity97 's program ' meet the @entity98 ' days later that inserting that language ' was a mistake			1
' ' i would n't put that line there , ' @entity94 said			0
with that one rhetorical flourish near the end of an otherwise uninspiring economic speech at @entity108 , the president made the elections , in part , about himself			0
and with @entity2 's approval numbers hovering just below 40 per cent – and dipping to a disastrous 33 per cent in @entity13 's @entity16 – that turn does n't bode well for his party			1
stalking horse : @entity2 said in a radio ad that @entity116 ( right ) , a @entity117 politician who wo n't be seen with him , will nonetheless vote for his policies if she wins a @entity15 seat already four different @entity3 @entity15 candidates have dodged the question of whether they voted for the president , including @entity123 secretary of state @entity38 , who is challenging @entity15 minority leader @entity40			1
in the tense @entity126 race , democrat @entity124 found herself between the proverbial rock and hard place on tuesday , when an @entity130 reporter asked her if @entity2 is ' a strong leader ' in the face of crisis			1
' we were late to the table ' on @entity30 , @entity124 conceded			2
' so you do n’t think he showed strong leadership ? ' came the reporter 's follow - up			2
' certainly , ' she conceded , ' there are issues that i certainly think – um , no. ' @entity61 , at the @entity0 , demurred on thursday with stronger resolve than @entity124 showed in defending @entity2			1
@entity124 has a history of delivering results for @entity146 , @entity61 told reporters , ' even if it means criticizing the leader or her own party			2
i think that 's a testament to her leadership			0
' @entity0 press secretary @entity61 said thursday that @entity2 is ' relevant ' because he 's president – but did n't offer specific policy reasons as @entity2 's coattails have shrunk in his second term , surrogates like former president @entity34 have given speeches and worked fundraising rooms on his behalf in states where a lost @entity15 race could contribute to a @entity89 controlled exclusively by the @entity41			1
' make sure nobody casts a protest vote , ' @entity34 told a crowd of @entity39 on wednesday			1
' whoever heard of somebody giving a six - year job for a two - year protest ? ' @entity2 tried this week to clamp off the flow of blood to the @entity3 's more resentful wing by telling @entity130 host @entity172 that his electorally vulnerable detractors are all ' folks who vote with me			1
' ' they have supported my agenda in @entity89 , ' he said , even if they 're keeping their distance when voters are within earshot			0
that message resonated in @entity117 this week when a radio ad started running on urban - contemporary radio stations in majority - black counties			0
' if @entity116 wins , that means that @entity3 keep control of the @entity15 , and that means that we can keep on doing some good work , ' @entity2 is heard saying in the 30 - second spot			1
@entity116 is squaring off against @entity41 @entity192 in a contest for an open @entity15 seat			0
@entity2 has n't appeared with her on the campaign trail .			0

@entity16 @entity3 sen. @entity13 , facing tough re-election fight , says president is ' not relevant . he 's gone in two years '
is @entity2 a ' strong leader ? ' @entity200 @entity3 sen. @entity124 responded : ' certainly there are issues that i certainly think *...* um , no '
@entity0 fires back and insists @entity2 is ' relevant in a lot of important ways '
@entity34 told a @entity123 crowd not to give a @entity41 ' a six - year job for a two - year protest ' against the sitting president
