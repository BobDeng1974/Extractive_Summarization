@entity3 's battle with @entity4 proves it is impossible to control immigration from the @entity7 , @entity1 's far right leader @entity0 has claimed			1
the @entity8 , who is standing for president in 2017 , held up mr @entity3 as an ' example ' of how @entity13 freedom of movement rules were sacrosanct in @entity4			1
ms @entity15 wrote on @entity16 : ‘ we are not free to decide our immigration policy – as the example of mr @entity3 recently proved			1
mrs @entity24 warned the prime minister that he was reaching a ‘ @entity33 ’ by pushing for reform of the bloc ’s sacred free movement system			1
the threat has forced mr @entity3 to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb @entity7 immigration			1
mr @entity3 has reportedly ditched a plan to impose a cap on the number of migrants allowed into @entity26 from the @entity7			1
ministers will instead focus on making the existing rules work better for @entity26			2
a source said mr @entity3 ’s plans – to be outlined before @entity46 – would stretch @entity7 rules ‘ to their limits ’			1
she wrote : ' we are not free to decide our immigration policy – as the example of mr @entity3 recently proved ’ @entity25 chancellor @entity24 has blocked proposals to cap the number of @entity7 migrants allowed into @entity54 one proposal would ban @entity7 migrants coming to @entity26 unless they had a job to go to			1
anyone unable to support themselves would be deported after three months			2
it is thought the prime minister will seek mrs @entity24 ’s approval before announcing any changes			2
critics said mrs @entity24 ’s warning demonstrated the weakness of mr @entity3 ’s position			2
eurosceptic @entity69 mp @entity68 said : ‘ it is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation			0
' @entity74 leader @entity73 said : ‘ the only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum			0
’ it came after a close ally of the pm warned that he may “ never be able to control ” immigration from within the @entity7 and voters will have to accept that “ a very large ” number of foreigners will come to the @entity84 every year			1
@entity85 , a business and education minister , said that freedom of movement is a “ fundamental principle ” of the @entity7			1
@entity90 mayor @entity89 was joined by @entity91 , deputy mayor of @entity90 ( right ) and @entity92 , first deputy to the mayor ( left ) to give evidence to @entity95 last week where campaigners fear that a new planned camp in @entity90 could quickly turn into a ' ghetto ' for migrants meanwhile , it emerged today that @entity84 taxpayers will be contributing to a new £ 2.35 million a year welcome centre for @entity84 - bound illegal migrants in @entity90			1
the bill will be added to the £ 12million the @entity84 government has already pledged to the @entity1 to improve security in the port town this year			2
during a visit to @entity90 on monday , @entity1 interior minister @entity108 signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by january			0
but aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive ' ghetto ' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the @entity119			0
mr @entity108 said the centre will have ' a budget of more than three million euros a year , which the state will be asking the @entity7 for			2
' @entity26 pays more than £ 8bn a year to the @entity7 , meaning @entity84 money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to @entity90 , who currently number around 2,500			1
mr @entity108 said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks , where migrants try to get on lorries every day			0
@entity135 , @entity134 , @entity136 and @entity137 have seen the biggest increases in @entity139 in the last six years , according to official government figures the facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day , and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable			0
thousands of migrants are camped in @entity90 waiting for their chance to make it to @entity26			0
the @entity1 port ’s mayor told @entity151 last week that @entity26 was seen as an ‘ @entity152 ’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey			0
blaming the @entity84 for the crisis , @entity89 said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the @entity119			2
she said illegal migrants , many fleeing humanitarian disasters in @entity164 and the @entity165 , were ‘ prepared to die ’ to reach @entity26 , believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold , @entity152			0
giving evidence to the @entity170 home affairs select committee , she said : ‘ the real magnet is not the city of @entity90 but the benefits that are perceived in @entity26			0
‘ the weekly benefits of £ 36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives			0
‘ they have no idea about the value of money … but they know from those people who have got through [ to @entity26 ] that … they can easily find work , do n’t have to declare their work , they can find accommodation and can get some money every week			0
people who have got through call and say , “ … this is @entity152 and we ’re staying here ”			0

@entity91 's battles with @entity4 held up as an ' example ' by @entity0
