by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 suffered an injury on sunday but should still be fit to inject some dynamism into the top of @entity8 ’s order for the one - off @entity9 international at @entity11 that will complete @entity13 ’s up - and - down tour			1
it looked as if the hard - hitting batsman ’s international debut would be delayed when @entity3 had to retire hurt after being struck on the right thumb by @entity18 during @entity20 ’s match against @entity22 @entity21 yet an x-ray revealed only bruising and @entity3 should be ready to play next sunday			1
and with @entity8 batting so badly thus far in the @entity27 one - day series , that match may yet prove to be an audition for a late @entity30 call - up			1
scare : @entity3 has been in superb form for @entity20 during this year 's @entity33 blast and ... relax : @entity3 posted a message on @entity35 to assure fans he would be fit for his @entity8 debut @entity38 ( captain ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( wkt ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity3 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51			1
@entity3 explained : ‘ i tried to bat on after i got hit but then got a bit worried and shot off to get an x-ray for my peace of mind			0
everything was fine and it should be fully healed in a couple of days			0
‘ it ’s been a dream to play for @entity8 since i was a pup			0
this is a huge opportunity for me and i ’m very excited			0
’ those who believe @entity8 ’s 50 - over squad lacks flair will welcome a @entity9 party which also includes @entity49 , the most unlucky of current players not to play more for @entity8 , and the recalled @entity41			1
there was also a surprise call for @entity42 , whose @entity8 days seemed to be over after @entity9 defeat by @entity71			2
his participation is in doubt , however , as he played no part in yesterday ’s @entity75 after suffering a chest injury			0
it is @entity3 ’s selection , though , that will draw most attention with @entity8 ’s inability to post big limited - overs scores becoming acute , as demonstrated in their latest crushing defeat at @entity84 on saturday			1
dynamic : the opener blasted 677 runs in the competition , earning him a first call - up to the @entity8 squad return : @entity49 's excellent limited overs form has earned him a place back in the @entity8 reckoning there is no question that @entity3 , top scorer in this year ’s @entity95 with 677 runs at a strike - rate of 157 , can score quickly and aggressively			1
the question is whether his technique will stand up to the highest scrutiny			0
@entity101 , @entity20 ’s director of cricket , said that @entity3 , 24 , hits the ball ‘ harder than anyone i ’ve played with or seen ’ as he showed when striking five sixes in an over for @entity107 this season			2
‘ it ’s not brute strength that creates the power because it ’s the same when he strikes a rugby ball or football , ’ said @entity101 , @entity8 ’s most capped player			0
i ’ve seen him stun a ball for six			0
he does n’t follow through , he checks it			0
’ those who worry about @entity8 ’s identity will note that @entity3 was born overseas , but he learnt his cricket at @entity20 after emigrating with his parents from @entity123 to @entity8 when he was nine			1
@entity124 : @entity41 's big hitting , clever shotmaking and canny bowling is useful in @entity33 cricket @entity3 ’s path to the top has not always been smooth but he has settled down under the guidance of @entity20 coach @entity132			1
@entity8 will be captained by @entity38 in the absence of @entity134 , who has an operation on his right knee on wednesday that will rule him out until the triangular series against @entity138 and @entity13 that precedes the @entity30			2
@entity38 , among the best limited - overs batsmen in the world , has been one of the biggest disappointments in @entity8 ’s woeful 50 - over cricket that sees them 2 - 0 down against @entity13 after saturday ’s six - wicket defeat with just tomorrow ’s match and friday ’s at @entity145 to come			2
