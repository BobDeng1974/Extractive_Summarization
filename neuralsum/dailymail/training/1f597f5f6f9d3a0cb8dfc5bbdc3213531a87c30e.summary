@entity20 , who worked at the @entity22 ' farm before and after the murders , has told a new investigation that the atmosphere at @entity26 in @entity27 changed dramatically a few months beforehand			1
@entity3 and @entity28 , both 61 , were shot dead by their adopted son @entity12 , right - @entity3 foresaw his death @entity31 , @entity3 's adoptive sister , and her twin sons @entity34 and @entity35 , six , were killed she said the elder mr @entity3 looked tired and worried and told her he feared something appalling was going to happen			1
mrs @entity20 said : ' for some weeks he looked really drawn and ill. he seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders			2
' i thought he might have cancer ... he said he had n't got anything like that but he had got great problems			0
' i asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die			0
i said " what makes you think that ? " and he said there might be a serious shooting accident			2
' ' knowing what had been going on , [ @entity52 ] thought that he knew that @entity12 was going to perhaps shoot him			2
' weeks later , @entity53 and @entity28 , their model daughter @entity31 , 28 , and her six - year - old twins @entity35 and @entity34 were shot dead at the @entity15 farmhouse			1
killing scene : @entity26 , at @entity27 , where the mass murder took place in august 1986 accused of the murders , privately - educated @entity3 told the court his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that @entity31 had gone mad , before the phone went dead			1
he claimed his sister , who developed schizophrenia , had shot everyone before shooting herself , but prosecutors said this was impossible because a silencer was found with @entity31 's blood on it , and @entity3 was found guilty on a 10 - 2 majority verdict			1
in a tv interview for a new documentary , countdown to murder , mrs @entity20 said that @entity3 , now 52 , would provoke his mother , june , by riding his bike round and round her in circles , trying to hit her			1

@entity3 , now 52 , has always maintained his model sister @entity31 , right , killed her family in a psychotic episode mrs @entity20 added : ' @entity12 would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty ...

sometimes when @entity12 came up they would have a hectic row ... whenever @entity12 was around the atmosphere was so different			0
' she said that when @entity3 took over his father 's farm after the murders , she never once saw him grieving for his family			2
' i wanted to shout out to him " i know what you 've done " but i did n't have the guts to do it ...			0
' i think i might have ended up the same way as @entity3 and mrs @entity28			0
' @entity3 , seen here with his then girlfriend @entity111 at one of the funerals after the slaughter detectives investigating the murder found a silencer with @entity31 's blood on it			2
it was argued that without a silencer , the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger			0
and if the silencer had been attached to the gun , it would have been too long for @entity31 to have shot herself with it			0
the prosecution argued that @entity3 had no interest in inheriting his father 's business , but wanted the Â£ 436,000 family fortune			0
when @entity3 offered his son a job on the farm in 1986 , it was the catalyst for the younger man , who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away , to plan a way to get the money for himself			2
@entity3 , one of only 38 prisoners in @entity144 and @entity145 serving a whole - life sentence , has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in september 1986			1
