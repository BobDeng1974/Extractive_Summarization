the five - storey high boathouse is thought to be from about 117 ad copper tacks used for shipbuilding at @entity12 , the ancient port of @entity13 ( left ) and archaeologists from the @entity8 and the @entity26 , work on the site of the amazing discovery the archaeologists scrap away at the ruins having discovered a large structure that was used for ship building the largest find of its kind in @entity37 or the @entity38 , it was found close to a distinctive existing hexagonal basin or ' harbour ' at the centre of the huge ancient port complex , which covers two square miles			1
it sits by the side of @entity45 and is now more than two miles from the @entity38			1
the building is so grand archaeologists think it had some form of imperial connection and might have been used for a base for galleys that transported emperors , such as @entity4 , across the empire on their way to places like @entity6			2
@entity4 ( @entity56 ) lived from 24 january 76 ad â€“ 10 july 138 ad and was roman emperor from 117 to 138			2
he is best known for building @entity58 , which marked the northern limit of @entity61 territory in @entity6			2
in @entity13 , he re-built the @entity62 and constructed the @entity63 of @entity64 and @entity65			2

the new building is further proof of a link to the leaders of the @entity61 world and the importance of the ruins			0
@entity8 professor and @entity12 project director , @entity89 , said : ' this is an exciting and important discovery and the building is a really , really fantastic thing to find			1
' emperors leaving and coming back in this period , like @entity4 , must have come through @entity12 and they must have had a place to stay and leave from that was of a status similar to what we have found			0
' at first we thought this large rectangular building was used as a warehouse , but our latest excavation has uncovered evidence that there may have been another , earlier use , connected to the building and maintenance of ships			0
' @entity111 imperial shipyards have been discovered and , if our identification is correct , this would be the largest of its kind in @entity37 or the @entity38			1
' @entity12 was a crucial trade gateway linking @entity13 to the @entity38 throughout the @entity61 period and the archaeologists have been investigating the port 's significance over a number of years			1
until now , no major shipyard building for @entity13 had been identified , apart from the possibility of one on the @entity124 near @entity125 , and a smaller one recently claimed for the neighbouring river port at @entity127			0
' this was a vast structure which could easily have housed wood , canvas and other supplies and certainly would have been large enough to build or shelter ships in , ' prof @entity89 said			0
' the scale , position and unique nature of the building lead us to believe it played a key role in shipbuilding activities			0
' already archaeologists have found tacks which would have been used to nail lead on to the hulls of ships inside one of the bays			0
