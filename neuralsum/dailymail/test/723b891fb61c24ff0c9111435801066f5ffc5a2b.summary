the possession police are out in force , and @entity2 is the @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
the football purists are foaming at the mouth – how can this @entity8 pretender dare to win games without wanting the football ? is this the most negative side to ever win the title ? is this the most terrible team to lift the @entity14 ’ crown ? woah there , just hang on a moment			2
@entity2 has come under fire for @entity20 's lack of possession during their 1 - 0 win over @entity23 @entity2 and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over @entity23 on saturday at @entity27 i ’m no fan of the kind of football @entity20 played on saturday to beat @entity23			1
but at the end of the season , they are getting the job done , it ’s as simple as that			0
and who can blame @entity2 for being so cautious ? last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at @entity43 and @entity44 – both in the bottom half of the table at the time , and were beaten at home by @entity49 , who were six points adrift in 20th place			2
and then needing a win to go top of the @entity4 with just two games to go , @entity2 watched his side draw 0 - 0 at home to @entity58 , who were about to be relegated			1
the title that had been in their grasp , was lost			0
@entity20 ’s most impressive result during that run - in was a 2 - 0 win at @entity66 , a game made famous by @entity69 ’s slip			1
it ended @entity66 ’s 16 - match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title			2
that day @entity20 let @entity66 have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes			1
@entity20 found a way to win without the ball			2
and @entity2 did the same on saturday to an in - form @entity23 , who had 70 per cent possession at @entity27			1
it ’s not my kind of football – i like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball			0
@entity23 boss @entity88 was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by @entity20 @entity69 slips against @entity20 at @entity90 last season - a game @entity20 won with only 17 % possession ba scores as @entity20 go on to win at @entity90 and effectively end @entity66 's title push last season the @entity97 master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit			1
all clubs have injuries , but for that massive game on saturday , @entity23 needed key players in the team			1
it would have been fascinating to see if @entity107 ’s possession philosophy would have won the day , over the @entity2 way			2
@entity20 won the game , and they did it in typical @entity2 fashion – by not wanting possession of the football			1
@entity2 has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season			1
i understand his pragmatism given that @entity20 are so close to sealing the title			2
but he fell into this negativity way too early in the season , and it led to their abject failure in @entity124			0
@entity2 needs to be more expansive in the @entity126 next season – that ’s for sure			2
@entity129 ’s goal against @entity130 after a sublime pass from @entity132 was a highlight of the season but do n’t judge this @entity20 side on the @entity4 run - in alone : they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style , but they have had some wonderful moments this season			1
on day one of the season @entity132 ’ sublime disguised pass for @entity129 ’s goal at @entity130 had us all out of our seats			0
it was n’t his only example of genius since august			0
when fit , @entity149 ’s strength , movement and finishing have been a joy to watch			0
and then there ’s @entity154			0
the player @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 and others all dream of being			0
yes some of those others have medals , but they have n’t shown the same amazing ability as the @entity20 number 10			0
his balance , his control , his passing and finishing have all been superb all season			0
@entity20 forward @entity154 ( left ) dribbles with the ball ahead of @entity173 's @entity172 ( right ) @entity174 ( second left ) scores against @entity176 as @entity20 run riot at the @entity178 in january and during this period when @entity2 is being over-cautious , making sure they secure the title they let slip last season , @entity154 has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity , to one capable of star quality			1
and back in january , @entity20 gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the @entity4 when they went to @entity176 and won 5 - 0			1
the one - touch football was special , and the way the three behind @entity149 drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of @entity194 ’ @entity196 and @entity197 sides of the 1970s			0
@entity20 were 4 - 0 in front at the break , by which time @entity200 had also hit the bar twice			1
@entity2 ’s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division			0
so do n’t be too harsh on @entity20 , on their way to the title it ’s hell to watch them right now			0
but @entity2 ’s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs .			0

@entity2 under fire after @entity20 only have 30 per cent possession in saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity23 at @entity27
