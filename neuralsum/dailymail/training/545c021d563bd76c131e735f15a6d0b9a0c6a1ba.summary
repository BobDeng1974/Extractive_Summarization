spiders can be scary enough when they ’re visible , but a new species spotted in @entity2 is able to hide itself by creating its own camouflage			2
the guerilla spider has been named @entity7 and is capable of perfectly covering its body with dust and soil collected from wherever it happens to be hiding			1
the thin coating means the spider blends in with its surroundings , keeping it safe from predators , as well as making it easier to pounce on unsuspecting prey			2

the thin coating means the spider blends in with its surroundings kepping it safe from predators , as well as making it easier to pounce on unsuspecting prey researchers from the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) hailed the discovery of the spider that 's capable of vanishing from view as ' a sensation '			1
they said the arachnid was a member of the @entity36 family , of which nine species are now known to exist in @entity39 and @entity40			1
the camouflaging spider was discovered in the natural protected area of @entity43 , in the south - eastern @entity2 state of @entity45			1
the camouflaging spider was discovered in the natural protected area of @entity43 , in the south - eastern @entity2 state of @entity45 ( pictured )			1
it is distinguished from other species because it has rough skin , like scales , that is used by to attract floor particles , which in turn give it perfect camouflage researchers said the spider is a member of the @entity36 family , of which nine species are now known to exist in @entity39 and @entity40			1
the baldlegged spiders ( pictured ) are closely related to tarantulas spiders are growing far larger in the cities than in rural environments , researchers have said			0
they found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation , golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of @entity70 , @entity71 , were larger and had more babies			0
they added that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame			0
' city - dwelling orb - weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows , ' said @entity83 of the @entity84 , who led the research			0
this study showed invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation , but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities			0
‘ it is distinguished from other species because it has rough skin , like scales , that are used by the animal to attract floor particles which in turn give it perfect camouflage , ’ said the university			2
‘ in order to make sure its vision is not obstructed by its camouflage of dirt , the spider has eyes that are raised up higher than usual so that it can see over the covering			1
’ the university said they first identified immature spiders of the new type in 2010 , and then found adults , which are typically around four inches long , a year later			0
but , the discovery has only just been published in medical journal @entity115			0
professor @entity116 , who led the university 's research team , said the name @entity120 came from the geographical location where the spiders were discovered			2
‘ if you do not look carefully , you can lift a stone up and look and not see that the spider is there , ’ continued professor @entity116			0
‘ in fact you can often only see them when they move which may well be why they escaped notice so long			0
