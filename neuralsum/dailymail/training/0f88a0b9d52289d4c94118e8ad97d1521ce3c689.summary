by @entity0 new police recruits will not have to serve as a bobby on the beat for the first time in @entity5 as the rule forcing them to be join as a pc was scrapped today			1
the ' brightest and best ' will instead enter at superintendent level as part of an overhaul of recruitment rules unveiled by policing minister @entity13			2
it has raised concerns @entity5 's forces will produce a generation of senior officers ' who have n't felt the collar ' of a criminal and lead to ' risks to the public ' , the president of the @entity16 ' @entity15 has said			1
' one of the benefits of having an operational grounding is that you have been able to deal with critical incidents , you have dealt with the very sad incidence of dead bodies , ' he added fast track : rules restricting young stars flying up the ranks of @entity5 policing will be relaxed , meaning some could be chief constables at 30 this brat pack of talented police officers could also become chief constables by the time they are 30 under the new government plans			1
foreigners can also join the @entity5 police for the first time while experienced individuals from other industries like politics , business and the armed forces can be given senior jobs			1
' the fast - track - to - inspector scheme will attract the brightest with the most potential to go on to become leaders , ' mr @entity13 said			1
' direct entry at senior ranks will make sure that there is access to the best pool of talent , those who have proven leadership and business skills and who can bring with them fresh thinking from other sectors			2
' currently nobody under the age of 40 is in any of the 330 - or - so top jobs in @entity5 policing , but the fast - track scheme could halve the 20 to 25 years it would take to get there			1
@entity13 : ' direct entry at senior ranks will make sure that there is access to the best pool of talent ' , the policing minister said changes would also allow individuals like @entity83 supercop @entity82 , who tackled gang crime and reformed policing in @entity86 and @entity87 , to run the @entity88			1
mr @entity82 was courted by @entity89 to run @entity90 in 2011 , but was blocked from applying because of concerns about appointing a foreigner to a post with national security responsibilities			1
the overhaul is part of a package of reforms that were drawn up by ex-rail regulator @entity99 in the most wide - ranging review of police pay and conditions in more than 30 years			2
changes : supercop @entity82 , pictured running @entity87 police , says he would love to run the @entity88 as @entity107 is changing rules to allow foreigners to run @entity5 forces under his proposals , ' exceptional ' applicants would have the chance to rise from civilian to inspector in just three years			1
successful businessmen and women , along with members of the armed forces and the security services , should all be encouraged to apply to the fast - track scheme , mr @entity99 said			2
mr @entity99 , who is now @entity123 's @entity122 , previously said he wanted to end the notion of policing as an intellectually undemanding occupation			2
he added that the ' brightest and best ' applicants with skills ' distinctly above those of factory workers ' were needed			1
sir @entity131 from the @entity132 said the changes could see existing officers frustrated in their bids for promotion			0
' all chief constables have served on the beat , experiencing the reality of day - to - day operational policing with the public			0
this is the model used by other countries who have followed the @entity5 system such as the @entity83			1
@entity82 , former chief of @entity86 started this way			2
the direct entry officer class model tends to be followed by para-military police forces such as the @entity150 crs or the @entity152 @entity151			0
' @entity132 has no problem with bringing in expertise from outside and in many forces up to 50 % of staff are non police officers			0
every force has senior civilian staff in top leadership positions in such fields as human resources , finance and it			0
on the other hand such matters as firearms operations , murder investigations and dealing with public disorder are commanded by those with proven expertise and records of achievement			0
' @entity13 predicted there would be a foreign @entity175 in ' years rather than decades '			0
' i have no idea [ when ] , but , yeah , years rather than decades			0
i think if five years ago you said " can you envisage the governor of the @entity181 talking to you in a @entity183 accent ? " , you would have thought that was a bit odd			0
' but actually , @entity186 is , i am told , the best central banker in the world and it ’s great that he ’s going to apply those talents in this country and the same will be true of senior policemen			0
' he said the government was committed to the reforms , and the consultation which would be announced today was on the implementation of the plan			0
' it will happen and we ’re consulting on how best to do it			0
but i think bringing in new talent so that our very , very good police service becomes even better in the future is absolutely essential to continue the reform that has successfully led to a fall in crime in this country			0
' metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity210 told a policing conference earlier this month that it was time to ' consider and support ' direct entry			0
he added that he would like to see one in 10 senior officers recruited from outside the police force			0
in addition , a proposal to allow candidates from the @entity83 , @entity183 , @entity219 and @entity220 , among others , to front up forces in @entity223 and @entity224 is expected			1
that will pave the way for a renewed interest in mr @entity82 , 65 , who said that leading the @entity88 is ‘ the only job ’ that interests him in the @entity5			1
the move will unsettle @entity210 , @entity88 commissioner since september 2011 , who has faced criticism over his handling of the ‘ plebgate ’ affair involving former chief whip @entity235			1
fear : the @entity238 riots , which spread across the @entity5 , shocked the nation and @entity82 's track - record in @entity87 and @entity86 is seen an ideal way to prevent a repeat mr @entity82 , who was consulted by mr @entity89 over tackling gangs after the summer riots in 2011 , was credited with halving the murder rate in @entity86 and cutting violent crime in @entity87			1
he advocates a zero - tolerance approach to policing			0
he said running the @entity88 was a unique and internationally important post			2
‘ there are three @entity252 police agencies that have great significance in international policing – @entity238 , @entity86 and @entity87 , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve had the privilege of leading the two police departments in the @entity83 that have that international impact and that is something that is part of my interest in the @entity88			1
’ at the heart of @entity82 's policing tactics are the use of injunctions , which restrict the movements of those accused of being in gangs or involved in organised crime			2
he also uses the ' broken windows ' theory - where he demands every crime should be investigated , however small , as he believes it will also reduce more serious crimes too .			0

@entity107 is changing rules about running @entity5 forces
rule forcing recruits to join as a pc will be scrapped to attract high - *fliers*
the 20 - 25 years it takes to reach the top jobs would also be halved
aimed at ' brightest and best ' with skills ' distinctly above factory workers '
@entity83 supercop @entity82 is vying to take over the @entity88 after rule change
@entity89 wanted him for @entity238 in 2011 but was stopped
