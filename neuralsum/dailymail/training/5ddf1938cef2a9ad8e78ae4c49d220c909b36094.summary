town halls are to be shamed into bringing back weekly bin collections following uproar over fortnightly collections @entity19 : do n't you wish you had a truth drug you could introduce into the water coolers at your nearest palace of local government ? if you could , these are the 10 straight answers you might get if you put questions to the council on the subject of the day , the bins			1

‘ @entity37 has been squeezed			0
it ’s time to understand there ’s a limit to what @entity37 will take			0
’ he can not force town halls to go back to weekly collections , but made it clear that voters should throw out councils which do not – a provocative suggestion , given that many of those that have gone fortnightly are conservative controlled			1
mr @entity9 told the @entity7 : ‘ i ’ve had council leaders sitting at this very table who claim their public like a fortnightly collection and are very supportive			0
well , good luck to them			0
come the elections , there can be no excuses			0

once - a - week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 and were maintained until after @entity76 ’s 1997 election victory , when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks			1
local government secretary @entity9 said councils will now have ' no excuse ' to maintain hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes householders quickly began to complain about increases in rats and other pests , unpleasant smells from food waste left uncollected for up to a fortnight , and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on those who broke the rules			1
now at least half the homes in @entity96 have lost their weekly collections of general rubbish			1
mr @entity9 said it was quite possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly collections of all rubbish			1
he hailed the example of @entity104 and @entity105 , which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering households incentives such as shopping vouchers or loyalty card points			0
mr @entity9 said councils could use the new cash to introduce innovative technology such as facilities which sort rubbish into recyclable items and those that need to go to landfill			2
‘ my aim has always been to pass the chicken tikka masala test , so the nation ’s favourite meal can be consumed on friday night safe from the worry that two weeks later its remains will still be rotting in the bottom of the bin , ’ he said			2
‘ i also want an end to bin blight , where rows of bins run the risk of obscuring a small bungalow			2
‘ @entity76 ’s solution was to bully councils into fortnightly collections			2
my view is this goes beyond bins – it ’s about a question of trust between politicians and the public			0
‘ the truth is that it ’s possible to protect and enhance the environment and encourage people to do the right thing , while also adopting a sensible approach to dealing with waste			0
’ @entity7 , june 2009 @entity7 , september 2009 @entity7 , april 2011 the local government secretary ’s announcement follows a battle between him and environment secretary @entity153 , who tried to ditch a @entity155 election pledge to restore traditional weekly collections			1
mr @entity9 insisted that mrs @entity153 – with whom he is said to have fallen out so badly that they stopped speaking for a period – was fully on side			0
‘ @entity160 should be very pleased			0
both @entity153 and i campaigned for this in opposition and we are now delivering that in government , ’ he said			0
mr @entity9 said the cash for the scheme was coming from within his department , even after spending cuts have been made			0
@entity169 , founder of the @entity170 , said : ‘ i am extremely pleased that this funding has been made available and our members will be absolutely delighted			2
’ @entity174 said : ‘ rubbish collection may not be seen as a sexy issue to the chattering classes in @entity178 , but it is of great concern to ordinary hardworking taxpayers			2
‘ @entity182 betide the councils who do not reinstate weekly bin collections or who persist with plans to scrap this basic service , causing misery to residents			1
