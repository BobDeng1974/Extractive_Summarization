by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 10:10 est , 5 december 2012 the memory of eating a large meal can make people feel less hungry hours after tucking into food , according to new research			1
after a series of tests experts found that people who think they have eaten more - but have actually eaten an average - sized or smaller portion - are less likely to experience hunger pangs hours later			1
the discovery could now be used to help dieters struggling to lose weight			1
the memory of a big meal could make you feel less hungry and help you lose weight , researchers at @entity15 have found they then manipulated the amount of soup they actually ate using a hidden pump that could refill or empty a soup bowl without the eater noticing			1
professor @entity26 and his colleagues from the @entity15 made the discovery after showing a volunteers either a small or large bowl of soup just before lunch			1
immediately after they had eaten , the level of hunger reported by the volunteers was equal to the amount of food they had eaten , not the amount they had seen just before eating			2
however , two to three hours after lunch , volunteers who had been shown a larger portion of soup were significantly less hungry than those who had seen the smaller portion			2
researchers manipulated the amount of soup the volunteers had eaten via a hidden pump that could refill or empty the bowl without them knowing			1
they hope that dieters could be tricked into thinking they had eaten more to help them control their hunger pangs even though they had had a smaller portion twenty four hours later , more of these volunteers who had seen the bigger portions believed that the portion of soup they had consumed would satisfy their hunger			1
a drink that could not only help you lose weight , but could also treat epilepsy , diabetes and possibly even @entity67 's has been developed by @entity69 scientists			0
the drink has been brewed by @entity71 , professor of physiological biochemistry at @entity69 and head of its @entity73 , at the behest of the @entity75			0
the drink does n’t involve a new drug			0
it contains something our bodies produce all the time			0
this key ingredient is ketones — the sources of energy our bodies make naturally when we start using up our fat stores for energy because there are no carbs around			0
according to the authors , their results show the impact memory processes have on feelings of satiety after a meal			2
they believe their findings could be used to trick dieters into thinking they were more full , and in turn reduce how much they ate			1
prof @entity101 said : ' for the first time , this manipulation exposes the independent and important contribution of memory processes to satiety			2
' opportunities exist to capitalise on this finding to reduce energy intake in humans			0
' this study is exciting because it exposes a role for cognition in the control of hunger - appetite is n’t governed solely by the physical size and composition of the meals we consume			0
' the study was published in the open access journal @entity122 .			0

people who think they have eaten more are less likely to feel hungry later
@entity15 researchers hope to trick the memory so that dieters eat less
