the @entity1 pantomime now has one of the directors trying to justify on social media the ongoing scandal of former chief executive @entity6 spending nine months in a @entity8 jail without charge or trial			1
@entity6 , who is sharing a small cell with two others , remains the longest - serving inmate at @entity8 police station despite his powerful legal team filing @entity17 actions for deceit , loss of earnings and false imprisonment against former @entity1 owners @entity23			1
@entity23 claim @entity6 took £ 3.9million against false invoices when employed by them at @entity1			2
@entity6 says he was owed that money in salary , commissions and expenses			0
former chief executive of @entity1 @entity6 has spent nine months in a jail in @entity8 but this farce , in which the @entity33 run by former @entity1 chief @entity34 should surely intervene , now has @entity35 , @entity23 ’s senior executive officer and a @entity1 board member , reacting on @entity37 to fans questioning @entity6 ’s extraordinary plight			1
@entity35 said : ‘ the lies being peddled by @entity6 are just that — lies			0
his incarceration is wholly the responsibility of the @entity8 police and public prosecutor who are considering criminal claims against him for defrauding @entity23			0
’ @entity35 , whose tweets are being examined by @entity6 ’s lawyers , also told fans he was responsible for uncovering @entity6 ’s alleged fraud			0
@entity52 , a fanciful @entity53 presidential candidate from the start , finished his statement announcing his failure to gain the necessary five nominations by saying he would declare in due course his preferred candidate — as if anyone cares a fig what he thinks now			1
@entity52 has announced that he has withdrawn his candidacy for @entity53 president the failure by former @entity53 deputy general secretary @entity52 to get endorsements , despite a year on the campaign trail as a stooge candidate for @entity69 , is understood to have a lot to do with opposition from @entity53 secretary general @entity72			1
@entity74 chairman @entity73 , who is addressing staff on tuesday about his streamlining plans , is keen to break down diversity barriers at @entity78			1
his latest move is to promote @entity80 , who has done a lot to develop the women ’s game , and human resources chief @entity84 to the @entity74 ’s all - important senior management team			2
@entity74 chairman @entity73 is keen to break down diversity barriers within his administration such moves , plus the arrival of interim chief operating officer @entity90 , will only add to speculation that @entity93 2015 chief executive and @entity33 director @entity92 remains top of @entity73 ’s list to be the next @entity74 chief executive and he will wait until she is available after the @entity98			1
also added to the @entity74 ’s senior management are head of communications @entity101 and public affairs chief @entity103			2
the number of times @entity108 finalists @entity106 and @entity109 made reference to the tournament sponsors during the presentations suggests @entity114 commercial director @entity113 is faring better in @entity115 then he did at the @entity33			0
@entity108 champion @entity106 kisses the @entity116 after his victory @entity113 was shown the door by the @entity119 for a failed commercial strategy but has signed seven new tennis sponsors in his first year in @entity122			0
sky fixing fixture farce one benefit of @entity126 broadcasting both @entity127 and @entity128 matches from 2016 is that the flagship @entity130 and the golf major will no longer clash — as they do this summer for the third year in a row and for a third successive @entity136 series			1
this ridiculous scheduling is blamed on @entity126 and the @entity138 by the @entity139 , whose open dates are the same every year			2
however , after @entity126 secure both events this week when their @entity108 deal is concluded , there is no chance of them being staged at the same time again			0
eleven months on from chairman @entity148 suffering the stroke that has prevented him returning to the role , the @entity147 are still some way off finding his successor			0
@entity154 lawyer @entity153 continues as temporary chief despite the @entity147 being his prime clients			0
@entity158 chairman @entity157 is taking responsibility for finding the next chairman			0
chief executive @entity161 being promoted to executive chairman still looks the most likely option			1

former chief executive @entity6 has been in @entity8 jail for nine months
@entity52 wo *n't* stand against @entity69 for @entity53 president
chairman @entity73 keen to break down diversity barriers at the @entity74
@entity126 will ensure that the dates of @entity127 and @entity136 no longer clash
