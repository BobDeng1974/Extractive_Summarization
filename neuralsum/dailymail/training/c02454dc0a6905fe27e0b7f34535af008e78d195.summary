many people feel more comfortable revealing their true feelings , hopes and stresses to a partner after sex and now one researcher thinks she knows why			1
@entity6 believes pillow talk is an undervalued ingredient in a satisfying and enduring relationship and is linked to the production of the ' trust hormone ' called oxytocin , which is released after orgasm			1
she found that women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sex than women who did not orgasm , which increased the emotional bond between couples			1
@entity6 believes post-sex pillow talk can influence relationship satisfaction just as much as other factors , such as the frequency and satisfaction of sex itself the assistant professor in the @entity30 at the @entity31 , became interested in investigating the role of pillow talk in relationships as people have such different experiences of it			1
many people said they open up about their feelings to a partner after sex regardless of the length of a relationship – a time period described as the post-coital time interval ( @entity45 ) by researchers @entity46 and @entity48			2
‘ why were some people sharing their innermost feelings , even when they knew the relationship had not yet reached that level ? what effects would these post-coital disclosures have on relationship satisfaction ? ’ professor @entity56 wrote in an article for the university			2
to explore the relationship between hormones and communication decisions , she looked at what people talked about during @entity45 as well as ‘ one important variable [ that ] was likely influencing this whole process – orgasm			2
’ ‘ to ignore the importance of orgasm would be to ignore a key piece of the pillow - talk puzzle , ’ she said			0
both men and women experience a post-climax oxytocin surge but testosterone is believed to dampen the effects so that men typically fell less warm and fuzzy after sex			1
a polarised view of crystals of @entity81 is pictured when individuals experience orgasm , physiological changes occur as a hormone called oxytocin floods their bodies			2
increases in this ‘ trust hormone ’ have been linked to many socially beneficial behaviours			0
both men and women experience a post-climax oxytocin surge but testosterone is believed to dampen the effects so that men typically fell less warm and fuzzy after sex			1
professor @entity56 found that women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sexual activity than women who did not orgasm			1
professor @entity56 found that women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sexual activity than women who did not orgasm professor @entity56 believes that oxytocin is the reason why , as women who climax have more of the hormone in their systems , which increases feelings of trust and connection , than women who did not , influencing individuals ’ decisions to talk about their feelings to their partners			1
she explained that women may talk more about their feelings after sex than men as men ’s higher levels of testosterone suppresses the oxytocin response			1
individuals in a committed relationship perhaps unsurprisingly disclosed more intimate feelings to their partners after sex than those in newer or more short - term relationships , professor @entity56 said			1
a previous study found that the afterglow of an orgasm minimises the risks and increases the benefits of disclosing personal information			0
scientists have found that women whose partners finish off a night of passion by immediately turning over and nodding off are left feeling insecure and craving affection			0
psychologists at the @entity145 said cuddling and talking after sex is a crucial way for a couple to express their commitment to each other , in a study published last january			0
in relationship terms , they said it could be just as important as what happens before sex , or even the act itself			0
they questioned 456 heterosexual people who completed online surveys about their sleep patterns with their partner			0
lead author dr @entity46 said they found the participants ’ desire for emotional bonding , affection and communication was greatest when their partner fell asleep first			2
this was found in both men and women but a wealth of previous studies have shown men invariably fall asleep first			2
dr @entity46 said : ‘ when their partner feel asleep first , they craved that bonding time , for expressions of affection and endearment and felt it was lacking			0
‘ a woman could be pregnant			0
although with contraception that may not be the case anymore , we still have this psychology , and the post-coital time is when the couple makes promises to each other and establish commitment			0
‘ the time couples spend together after sex might be as important as what happens before it in terms of building the relationship yet it has rarely been studied			0

researcher at the @entity31 , examined link between *amount* of oxytocin in a person *'s* body and communication after sex
men and women experience a post-climax oxytocin surge but testosterone is believed to dampen the effects so men typically fell less affectionate
professor @entity6 found women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sex than women who did not orgasm
