the @entity0 has revealed that @entity1 could be granting @entity2 illegal rebates worth billions of dollars which may have to be repaid			1
if the @entity6 's initial findings are confirmed over the coming months , @entity2 could face a massive repayment bill because it funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in @entity1 , where it benefits from low , negotiated tax deals			1
in a letter to the @entity1 government published on tuesday , the @entity0 , which is carrying out an investigation into @entity2 's overseas tax practices , said the treatment granted to @entity2 ' constitutes state aid ' and therefore raises ' doubts about the compatibility ' with @entity6 law			1
the @entity6 first announced the probe in june , also targeting coffee store chain @entity31 and others as part of a crackdown on multinationals exploiting tax loopholes			0
the @entity0 is now requesting further documents from @entity1 before making a legally binding decision on whether the rebate granted to @entity2 is illegal and must be recouped , wholly or partially			2
the @entity6 probe focuses on exaggerated transfer pricing , where one part of a company charges another part an inflated price for goods or services to shift profits to low - tax locations			2
if @entity2 had to repay some taxes , the money would come as a windfall to @entity1 state coffers			0
however , fearful of losing its reputation as a business - friendly country with low corporate taxes , the @entity1 government is adamant that no @entity6 rules have been breached			1
the @entity0 , however , said in the letter that the tax deals struck with @entity2 in 1991 and in 2007 show ' several inconsistencies ' and may not comply with international taxation standards			1
the @entity66 - based executive body also was critical of the fact that @entity2 's applicable tax rate appears to have been the result of ' a negotiation rather than a pricing methodology ' which a ' prudent , independent ' tax authority should not have accepted			2
@entity1 presence : @entity2 has a large distribution centre on an industrial estate on the outskirts of @entity77 @entity2 's tax practices have also attracted scrutiny in the @entity80 , where a @entity81 last year published a scathing report on the @entity85 - based firm 's tax schemes			1
the report held up @entity2 as an example of legal tax avoidance made possible by the complicated @entity80 tax code , estimating the firm avoided at least $ 3.5 billion ( Â£ 2.1 million ) in @entity80 federal taxes in 2011 and $ 9 billion in 2012 by using its tax strategy			0
@entity2 - one the world 's most valuable and profitable firms - sat on some $ 164 billion in cash and cash equivalents , with $ 138 billion stashed away in foreign subsidiaries , according to its latest quarterly report in june			0
the company estimated its effective @entity80 tax rate is 26.1 percent , as opposed to the statutory @entity80 rate of 35 percent , primarily because of undistributed foreign earnings			0
a ' substantial portion ' of those foreign earnings was generated by subsidiaries organised in @entity1 , @entity2 said in the regulatory filing , adding that ' such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the @entity80 ' .			0
