@entity0 today spoke of his fears about his own children using the internet , as he unveiled new laws to tackle web pornography			1
the prime minister said he did not want to ' seem like a fuddy - duddy ' but technology meant there were new threats which children face today which did not exist when he was young			1
at a summit with internet firms and experts in @entity16 , he announced a new criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created , closing a staggering loophole in the law			1
@entity0 said that a new law will allow police to pursue paedophiles who ' fish ' for victims online paedophiles who currently solicit explicit pictures of children routinely escape punishment if it ca n't be proved they have received an illegal image			1
but the new law will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who send text messages or ' fish ' for victims online , irrespective of the outcome of their behaviour			1
mr @entity0 announced that a @entity41 currently going through @entity42 will introduce a broad new offence , punishable by two years in jail			1
it will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who ' fish ' for child victims on social networks and chat rooms but can not usually be punished unless they can be shown to have received an illegal image			1
mr @entity0 said he was approaching the troubling issue of online child abuse , not just as prime minister but as a ' dad '			1
' i have a 10 - year - old , an eight - year - old and a four - year - old and i want them to grow up on safe streets but also grow up with safe internet too , ' he said			0
' children growing up in our world today , there are lots of threats they face			1
' i 'm 48 , i do n't want to seem like a fuddy - duddy , but when i grew up , it was ' could you help @entity72 work the betamax video recorder ? ' ' now we have tablets , @entity76 , iphones , @entity78 in the house ... a whole set of new things we have to do make sure our children are safe			2
' mr @entity0 said he and his wife @entity83 had applied filters to computers and other devices in their home to keep the internet safe for their children			0
the pm urged parents and children to talk to each other about the dangers of online child sexual exploitation but added : ' that 's difficult for parents - we 're still learning a lot about the internet ourselves			1
' mr @entity0 told the @entity102 summit how he had taken steps to protect his three children from danger online mr @entity0 ( 5th from right , front row ) posed with international representatives at the summit at @entity109 it was announced that @entity112 's spy agencies are to try to break up the so - called ' dark web ' used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online			1
@entity116 will also form a new specialist unit with the @entity118 to tackle the serial offenders who hide from justice by using encrypted internet networks other new measures include new technology being used to add a ' digital fingerprint ' to child abuse images and videos identified by the authorities that will prevent them being copied and shared			0
revenge porn - the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – will become a specific offence			1
it will also become illegal to possess any item that contains advice or guidance about abusing children sexually			2
' we have seen an increasing and alarming phenomenon of adults grooming children online , encouraging them to send images of themselves over the internet or on mobile phones , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' there can be no grey areas here			0
if you ask a child to take their clothes off and send a picture , you are as guilty as if you did that in person			0
' so we are changing the law			2
just as it is illegal to produce and possess images of child abuse , now we are making it illegal to solicit these images too			2
' this law will make it clear – this is a crime , and you will be prosecuted for it			1
' the new offence will include things like talking about sex to a child via a chat room or sending sexually explicit text messages to a child , as well as inviting a child to communicate sexually			2
it is a victory for the @entity179 , which has run a long campaign which it called ' @entity181 '			0
legislation covering this areas predates the widespread use of the internet and particularly social networking sites			0
it also fails to recognise the nature of grooming , where an abuser aims to flatter the child rather than sending indecent or offensive communications			0
prosecutors have attempted to use other legislation , such as the @entity196 , to pursue online paedophiles – but currently have to show they have incited some kind of sexual activity by a child , such as posing for naked pictures			1
the new offence criminalises anyone 18 years of age who communicates with a child under 16 if the communication is sexual or intended to elicit from the child any sexual response			1
experts believe it will be valuable in targeting offenders at an early stage in offending against children , and could prevent such behaviour from escalating to more serious forms of criminality such as sexual grooming or actual child abuse			2
the @entity179 's research shows that there has been a 168 per cent increase in the number of children being counselled by @entity223 about online sexual abuse – averaging seven contacts a day to its helpline			1
@entity227 , @entity179 chief executive , hailed the announcement as ' a victory for our flaw in the @entity233 campaign but more importantly a major step forward in preventing online child abuse '			2
he added : ' the rise of online communication means that children are increasingly being exposed to sexual messages from adults , but in many cases the police have been powerless to act			1
the full force of the law can now be immediately brought to bear on anyone who grooms children for abuse online			1
' the new offence will include things like talking about sex to a child via a chat room or sending sexually explicit text messages to a child , as well as inviting a child to communicate sexually today 's summit is the latest in a string of initiatives announced by the government since the @entity259 launched its ' say no to @entity261 ' campaign in 2013			1
july 2013 : after a long - running @entity259 campaign , @entity262 announces plan to block online pornography unless households ' opt in '			2
all 19million @entity112 homes connected to the net are being contacted by service providers and told they must decide whether filters that block porn sites are switched on or off			2
the same month , pornography depicting rape is outlawed			0
november 2013 : @entity274 and other net giants announce measures to block searches for around 100,000 terms relating to child sexual abuse			0
instead warnings appear from @entity274 and charities at the top of search results , directing people to places they can get help			0
also last november , a @entity112 - @entity288 taskforce is established to target paedophiles who use the internet to hide from the law			2
december 2014 : offence of sexual communication with a child is announced			2
technology to stop child abuse images from being copied and shared to be introduced			0
at today 's summit , @entity274 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 will unveil new solutions to block and remove illegal child abuse material online			1
the digital fingerprints of thousands of known child sex abuse images identified by the @entity306 will be used by tech companies to prevent them being shared on their services , so they can no longer be viewed			0
@entity299 , @entity274 and @entity309 have also committed to investigate the feasibility of implementing browser level blocking restrictions designed to prevent people getting access to known child abuse material via @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317			0
restrictions are currently only in place to prevent images and videos of child abuse material from appearing in search results			0
@entity274 has seen a fivefold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made earlier this year following a @entity259 campaign			0
the prime minister also announced commitments from more than 30 countries to increase law enforcement ability to track more paedophiles and help more victims			1
they have agreed to set up their own national databases of child sex abuse material , enabling its removal from the internet , and to build better online reporting mechanisms like the @entity306			2
mr @entity0 said today : ' every time someone chooses to view an online image or a video of a child being abused , they are choosing to participate in a horrific crime			1
every single view represents that victim being abused again			0
they may as well be in the room with them			0
' i want to build a better future for our children			0
the package i am announcing today is a watershed moment in reducing the volume of child abuse images online			1
it marks significant progress in delivering a truly world - leading response to a global problem			0
' the so - called ' dark - net ' is increasingly used by paedophiles to view sickening images			0
i want them to hear loud and clear , we are shining a light on the web 's darkest corners ; if you are thinking of offending there will be nowhere for you to hide			0
' it is estimated that the number of offences relating to indecent images of children reaching magistrates ' courts will be over 22,500 this year – the highest ever			0
more than 1,000 alleged paedophiles have been arrested in @entity112 in the past 12 months , more than five times the 2012 - 13 figure of 192			0
conservative mp for @entity387 @entity386 said it was right to make it ' always illegal for an adult to send a sexual message to a child '			1
' given the alarming rise in online child abuse , it is very concerning that the current law is unable to adequately protect children , ' she said			1
@entity399 's @entity398 also backed reform			0
' existing laws are fragmented and sex offenders are able to , and often do , exploit the loopholes , ' he said .			0

police currently have to prove *suspects* have received an illegal image
but new law will allow police to pursue those who ' fish ' for victims online
punishment will apply irrespective of outcome of paedophile 's behaviour
the @entity41 will make offence punishable by two years in jail
revenge porn will also become a specific offence , @entity423 *confirmed* today
