@entity0 has confirmed @entity1 are paying money for all five @entity4 loanees - despite two of them being highly unlikely to ever appear for the @entity8 club			1
@entity0 has inherited a bizarre situation created by the extraordinary mass deal chief executive @entity10 brokered on transfer deadline day early last month			0
@entity10 – a former managing director at @entity12 – has since been ousted as a plc director and suspended from the football board at @entity8 following the takeover by @entity16 and his allies			0
@entity18 has revealed that @entity1 are paying some of the wages for the five players signed on loan from @entity4 in the january window even though only one of them is available at the moment of the five players loaned from @entity4 , only @entity26 will again be available for sunday 's crunch championship encounter with @entity29 after recovering from a calf knock			1
the only further first - team involvement has come from centre - back @entity32 , who managed 44 minutes against @entity35 last month before succumbing to a hamstring injury			1
youngster @entity37 , who has never played a senior game , is involved with @entity1 ’ under - 20 squad , but @entity0 revealed midfielder @entity40 has been ruled out for the season by an unspecified ‘ medical condition ’			1
the new @entity8 boss is also highly sceptical about ever having @entity45 international @entity44 available , as he recovers from a knee injury on @entity47			1
asked if the quintet were on @entity1 wage bill , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes			1
the club is paying for them			0
’ it ’s understood the @entity8 outfit only make a contribution to their @entity4 wages , rather than paying the entire salary they earn at @entity59 ’s club			2
@entity0 prepares the @entity1 players for sunday 's clash with @entity29 even so , the fact so little value has been earned will outrage @entity1 fans			1
‘ @entity65 ( @entity66 ) has a medical condition that our consultant is dealing with , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but he wo n’t play for us this season			2
‘ @entity37 is training and he has played two under - 20 games , but his match fitness is not up to what we would like at the moment			0
but he ’s working hard , the kid			0
‘ @entity44 has had a long - standing serious knee injury , i think he ’s been out for four or five months			1
he had a minor setback a couple of weeks ago , so he wo n’t be up with us for another couple of weeks			0
‘ by then he will have been out for five or six months so he ’ll likely need another six weeks to get him anywhere near being available			0
‘ so even though he might come up and train with us , depending on what level we can get him to , he looks a serious doubt to be involved			0
@entity0 faces the media on friday ahead of the crucial clash with second place @entity29 ‘ @entity86 came and played the first game and pulled his hamstring , was out for a couple of weeks then came back and pulled his thigh			1
and he ’s had an ear infection on top of that			0
‘ he ’s two or three weeks again , working with the medical side of it			2
but again i do n’t think @entity86 has played lots of football over the past two years			2
so we did n’t have guys coming in who were hitting the ground running , being ready to play			2
’ @entity0 said enquiries about @entity66 ’s condition would have to be directed to the medical staff			2
however , when pressed if it was something the 21 - year - old had contracted since moving to @entity106 , he replied : ‘ no. it ’s a long - standing thing			0
’ the current state of play begs the question as to whether @entity1 can simply send those not available back to @entity4			1
‘ i think that ’s not for me , that ’s for the hierarchy to sort out , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ certainly two of them - @entity65 and @entity44 - would be very doubtful , unless @entity44 recovers very quickly from his long - term knee operation			1
‘ for @entity37 and @entity118 , it ’s just about getting some football in them			0
if they are ready to go then we will consider them			0

@entity40 is ruled out for rest of season with ' medical condition '
