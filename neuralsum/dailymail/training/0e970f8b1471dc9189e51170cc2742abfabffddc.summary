a baby 's first smile , their first @entity2 , those unsteady first steps ... these are precious moments every new parent cherishes			2
but one couple missed nine months of their baby daughter 's life after officials wrongly took her away – and initially offered them just £ 500 in compensation			1
their child was even put up for permanent adoption before the case was thrown out by a judge , who described it as a ' debacle '			1
@entity20 and @entity21 have now been reunited with their daughter @entity22 ( pictured ) who was put up for permanent adoption in the ' debacle ' @entity20 and @entity21 , who have now been reunited with their daughter @entity22 , told the mail of their disgust last night at the ' insulting ' compensation offer			1
miss @entity20 said : ' those are months we will never get back			2
we read the log from when @entity22 was with the foster carer			2
when she rolled over for the first time			0
pictures from her first @entity2			0
' she was toddling when we got her back			0
we had missed her first step			0
i 'll never know if she called the foster carer mama before me			0
' @entity22 was born in november 2012 and is the first child of 27 - year - old miss @entity20 , a retail assistant , and mr @entity21 , 40 , a scaffolder , who have been together for nine years			1
miss @entity20 was attacked near her home in @entity45 , @entity46 , when she was six months pregnant , but fortunately her baby was not @entity48 in a seemingly heavy - handed decision after @entity22 's birth , social workers would not let the couple take her home in case they were targeted again and said she would be taken away if they did not find somewhere else to live			1
@entity54 , which oversaw the case , initially offered just £ 500 in compensation , which they later upped to £ 5,000 but the couple , who missed their daughter 's first steps , said they saw the offer as an ' insult ' and have refused to accept it miss @entity20 and mr @entity21 struggled to find somewhere and over the following weeks , the council placed them in a refuge and @entity68 across the country			1
' all we wanted to do was take her home , ' miss @entity20 said			2
' it was ridiculous but at every stage we were told : ' do this or we 'll take her away '			0
' a month later , the couple were taken to court with just one day 's notice , where they were told @entity22 would be taken into temporary care because of their chaotic lifestyle – which they say was caused entirely by social workers			1
the heartbroken parents fought through the courts to get her back , but social workers placed adverts for @entity22 to be adopted permanently			1
in a disorderly case overseen at times by a student social worker , the couple was twice sent private details about other children in care by accident – a serious breach of data protection			2
their case was finally heard by judge mrs justice @entity96 , who said social services had ' completely mishandled the situation '			1
describing the couple as ' loving parents ' , she reunited them with their daughter and – after a year of check - ups from social workers – they were told after @entity22 's second birthday last month that the case has finally been closed			1
@entity54 , which oversaw the case , apologised in private but refused to do so publicly			0
they later raised the compensation offer to £ 5,000 but the couple saw it as an ' insult ' and refused it			0
@entity109 mp @entity108 said : ' nothing can replace the time they have lost			0
a major injustice has taken place here			0
' a council spokesman said : ' the safety of the child is always of paramount importance			0
