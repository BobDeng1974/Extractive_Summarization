scroll down for a full table which shows what each club will earn in their current position			0
it is the final round of fixtures in another @entity7 campaign , and there is little at stake for clubs not involved in issues at either end of the table			0
so the theory goes , anyway , but try telling that to @entity15 ’s bank manager , with a win at home to @entity18 potentially raking in a near - £ 5million bonus for the @entity21 finalists			1
tv revenue is the big money - spinner in the @entity7 , but merit payments are not to be sniffed at			0
there ’s £ 1.2million for the bottom - placed club , with the amount rising by the same amount as you go up the table			0
so , if you climb one place on the last day , it is worth £ 1.2million			2
leap four places , as @entity15 conceivably could , and it ’s a cool £ 4.8million			0
in the money : @entity15 will be celebrating again if they can pick up £ 4.8 million on the final day with that in mind , we ’ve worked out how much is theoretically up for grabs for each team , heading in to sunday ’s games			1
do n’t forget , the calculations do not take into account what might happen to teams around them			0
also , we are discounting any team winning by a cricket score to overturn a massive goal difference deficit			2
@entity52 v @entity51 a win or draw could be worth £ 1.2million to @entity52			1
@entity51 need to win to have a chance of an additional £ 1m			1
plenty to play for : @entity51 may be out of the title race but a win for @entity59 's side could earn £ 1m @entity61 v @entity60 @entity61 need to win for an extra £ 1.2m			1
@entity60 can not go any higher or any lower			0
@entity15 v @entity18 if @entity15 win and manage a four - goal swing on goal difference with @entity65 , it could be worth £ 4.8m			1
even a draw could be worth £ 2.4m			2
@entity68 v @entity67 a win could be worth £ 2m for @entity68			1
@entity67 can not go higher , but if they fail to win and @entity71 pick up three points then the @entity70 will slip to 10th , losing £ 1.2m			0
plenty at stake : a @entity7 title for @entity68 would also see them pocket an extra £ 2m @entity78 v @entity65 neither side can go higher			1
defeat for @entity65 though could cost them up to £ 4.8m , with @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity15 all poised to pounce if they slip up			1
@entity85 v @entity84 neither side can go higher			0
a draw will all but guarantee @entity85 18th place and £ 3.6m windfall to soften the blow of relegation			2
@entity93 v @entity92 @entity93 stay same			0
a win could be worth £ 1.2m to @entity92			2
not over yet : the last act of @entity92 's interim management team could be to earn an extra £ 1.2m for the club @entity81 v @entity80 a win could be worth £ 2.4m to @entity81			1
a draw or win could bring @entity80 an additional £ 1.2m			0
@entity102 v @entity82 @entity102 can not move up			2
a win for @entity82 could be worth an extra £ 3.6m , a draw £ 1.2m			1
crucial cash : @entity82 manager @entity106 will be hoping he can boost his club 's coffers by £ 3.6m @entity109 v @entity71 a win for @entity109 could bring them an extra £ 3.6m			1
a win for @entity71 could bring them £ 1.2m .			0

@entity15 could earn an extra £ 4.8 million with a win over @entity18 and a four - goal swing on goal difference on @entity65
a win for @entity82 at @entity102 could be worth £ 3.6m for @entity106 's side
@entity51 may be out of the title race but could pick up an extra £ 1m if they finish second
@entity78 or @entity68 will earn £ *24m* for winning the league title
