by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 have become heroes in the scientific community			1
the cats have given up a small part of their genetic material to help researchers , for the first time , sequence the entire domestic cat genome			1
cats can suffer the same diseases as humans - such as leukaemia and @entity16 - and scientists say details about the cat genome could help doctors better understand these conditions			1
the researched involved an international team who were able to sequence the genome of @entity1 , an @entity26 cat living at the @entity27 in @entity28 ( left ) there have been a number of attempts at sequencing domestic cat dna , but this is the first project to successfully map a domestic cat ’s entire genome			1
it involved an international team who were able to sequence the genome of @entity1 , an @entity26 cat living at the @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity1 was sequenced in 2007 , but the technology at the time was only picked up about 60 per cent of her total dna			1
a cat ’s genome is of particular interest to geneticists because their genome has n’t changed much since they first @entity49 now hope to be able to compare a cat genomes to humans to see whether there are similarities , and why were are vulnerable to similar diseases the team also looked at the genes of @entity2 , a cat from @entity58 and @entity3 , a @entity60 wildcat , according to a report by @entity62 in @entity63			1
the cat ’s genome is of particular interest to geneticists because it has n’t changed much since the creatures first evolved			1
scientists now hope to be able to compare a cat genomes to humans to see whether there are similarities , and why both are vulnerable to similar diseases			1
a separate project , the 99 @entity74 is also collecting dna samples from cats worldwide			2
the work requires samples from cats that are neutered			2
the cats ' leftover ovaries , uteruses and testicles contain dna that can be extracted			2
they hope a full mapping of those 20,000 genes in different breeds could help pinpoint the genetic cause of distinguishing marks , like fur and eye colours and also cat health problems			0
it ’s estimated that pet owners in the @entity95 spend $ 26 billion ( £ 15.5 billion ) a year on looking after their cat ’s health			0
in the @entity100 , the average cost of looking after a cat is £ 17,000 ( $ 28,500 ) over its lifetime			0
sequencing means determining the exact order of the bases in a strand of @entity42			0
because bases exist as pairs , and the identity of one of the bases in the pair determines the other member of the pair , researchers do not have to report both bases of the pair			0
in the most common type of sequencing used today , called sequencing by synthesis , dna polymerase ( the enzyme in cells that synthesises @entity42 ) is used to generate a new strand of @entity42			0
in the sequencing reaction , the enzyme incorporates into the new dna strand individual nucleotides that have been chemically tagged with a fluorescent label			0
the reaction is different depending on which of the four nucleotides was incorporated			0
this method can generate ' reads ' of 125 nucleotides in a row and billions of reads at a time			0
researchers can use dna sequencing to search for genetic variations and / or mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease			2
@entity143 the disease - causing change may be as small as the substitution , deletion , or addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of bases			0

scientists have sequenced the genome of @entity1 , an @entity26 cat
genome of cats has changed very little since the creatures first evolved
this makes it of particular interest to scientists looking for dna variations
cats can suffer same diseases as humans - such as leukaemia and @entity16 - and the cat genome could help doctors better understand these illnesses
