accusations : @entity10 and his wife were kidnapped and flown to @entity4 where he was mistreated at a court hearing yesterday , government lawyers said ministers were ‘ likely ’ to ask for intelligence and other secret documents to be considered under the new rules			1
this could mean vast swathes of the case being held behind closed doors , with only state - approved lawyers allowed to hear the secret evidence			2
the new law , which is due to come into force later this year , was bitterly opposed by civil liberties campaigners because of its extension of secret justice			2
if the judge accepts the need for so - called ‘ closed material proceedings ’ it would likely be the first case in which the new rules are used			0
it could mean mr @entity10 and his lawyers being told little if anything about the evidence brought into play by the government and used against him			1
instead , when the court doors were closed , he would be represented by a security - cleared special advocate			0
@entity48 , qc for the government , told the @entity50 it was ‘ likely ’ that an application for closed proceedings would be made			0
claims : mr @entity10 accuses the @entity12 and former foreign secretary @entity13 ( pictured ) of serving him up to his torturers and is demanding compensation and an apology ‘ it is likely that , subject to ministerial consideration , that an application ... will be made , ’ he said			1
he also told the court the defendants , who include mr @entity13 and former @entity64 spymaster sir @entity63 , were still keen to settle the case			0
he said : ‘ they would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case			0
' ( the defendants ) would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case ' @entity48 , qc for the government ‘ the defendants for their part would like to reiterate ... their willingness to sit down with mr @entity10 and his representatives face to face			1
’ @entity48 for mr @entity10 and his wife said the defendants were accused of false imprisonment , conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office			1
the case revolves around whether ‘ the defendants involved themselves in the rendition of the claimants to @entity4 and if so does that give rise to a private law course of action			1
’ mr @entity10 has said he will drop the case for just £ 1 in return for an apology and admission of liability			1
he claims he was snatched by the @entity96 in @entity97 in 2004 , and held in a secret @entity99 ‘ black site ’			0
he and his wife were blindfolded and she was chained to the wall despite being visibly pregnant			2
handshake : the rendition took place around the time of the infamous ' deal in the desert ' between @entity9 ( right ) and former prime minister @entity108 ( left ) they were then flown to @entity110 where he was held for four years and tortured			2
the rendition took place around the time of the infamous ‘ deal in the desert ’ between @entity9 and former prime minister @entity108			0
after his release he became a key figure in the uprising against the @entity9 regime and is now a prominent @entity4 politician			1
after the fall of the regime , a document was found in the offices of @entity123 , @entity9 ’s spy chief which indicated @entity126 ’s role			2
in it , sir @entity63 appeared to take credit for the operation			0
describing mr @entity10 by a pseudonym , he wrote : ‘ this was the least we could do for you and for @entity4 to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years			1
‘ the intelligence on @entity137 was @entity126			2
i know i did not pay for the air cargo			0
but i feel i have the right to deal with you direct on this			0
