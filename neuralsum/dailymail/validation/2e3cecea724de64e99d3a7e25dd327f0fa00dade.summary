a team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people ’s eyes with ‘ night vision ’			1
the research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft ( 50 metres ) in almost total darkness for ' several hours '			1
by injecting his eyes with a liquid solution , he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time , while others who had n't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases			2
@entity21 researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision			1
the solution combines @entity25 ( @entity26 ) with insulin and saline			1
a small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher 's eyes			0
it briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed , seen in this image of researcher @entity37 the experiment was carried out by a group of so - called ‘ biohackers ’ in @entity21 called @entity41			2
they used a solution of a substance called @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , which is found in some deep - sea fish and has light - amplification properties , and is also been used in cancer treatment research			1
combining @entity49 with insulin and saline , the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions			1
in april , researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor , which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses			1
created by @entity64 researchers @entity65 and @entity66 , the sensor uses an atom - thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses			2
graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals			0
the process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light , @entity73 reported			0
' if we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics , it expands your vision , ' @entity66 said			2
' it provides you another way of interacting with your environment			0
' they note in their paper , though , that ‘ the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution			1
’ as a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home			1
@entity102 , @entity103 at @entity104 , told @entity105 that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment			0
' unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist , gp or pharmacist , people should not be inserting anything into their eyes , ' he warned			2
' an invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment , as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye ’s surface or tears , potentially leading to vision loss			2
' whilst the idea of " night vision eye drops " may seem interesting , this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval			1
' we would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice			0
' the experiment was carried out by a group of so - called ‘ biohackers ’ in @entity21 called @entity41			0
it is not advisable to try this at home			0
they used a solution containing @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , found in some deep - sea fish and has light - amplification properties , and is also used in cancer treatment research in the team 's experiment , the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of @entity37 , one of the researchers , which carried the solution to his retinas			1
‘ @entity26 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50μl [ microlitres ] into each eye , ’ the researchers wrote			1
the solution initially made his eyes turn black , before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour			0
' to me , it was a quick , greenish - black blur across my vision , and then it dissolved into my eyes , ' mr @entity37 told @entity172			0
however , to ‘ reduce the potential for bright light exposure , ’ the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses			0
within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low - light conditions			0
to test the effects , mr @entity37 and four ‘ control ’ subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a ‘ darkened area ’			1
within an hour , mr @entity37 was able to see in darkness - for several hours			2
in experiments he could see three times better than ' normal ' eyes			0
after testing , mr @entity37 wore sunglasses while he slept , and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal			0
shown is a stock image of @entity195 soldiers in @entity196 in 2003 they were then asked to identify symbols in the dark , either moving or still , and to spot individuals moving in a small grove of trees			0
‘ the @entity26 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls , ’ the researchers wrote			1
and , in the second test : ‘ the @entity26 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time , with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate			1
’ after testing , the team said that mr @entity37 wore sunglasses while he slept , and his eyesight in the morning appeared to return to normal			2
‘ as of 20 days , there have been no noticeable effects , ’ they said			1
while they note that more testing is needed , the initial results suggest that the technique can provide low light amplification in the human eye			0
‘ further testing is need to confirm and measure the degree of improvement in health subjects , ’ they concluded .			0

solution uses @entity25 ( @entity26 ) insulin and saline to enable night vision
a test subject was able to see in darkness ' for several hours '
ability wore off the following day , with ' no noticeable effects ' after 20 days
but researchers warn of a high risk of cellular toxicity as a result of the solution and said chemicals should be ' handled with caution ’
