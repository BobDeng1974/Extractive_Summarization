anyone who has visited a medium , and been astounded by their psychic abilities , will go away wondering the same question : how on earth did they know that ? well , it ’s bad news for believers , as one man has gone to extreme lengths to lift the lid on ‘ psychics , ’ revealing the tricks they use to con innocent people out of thousands of pounds and give them false hope			1
in his book , @entity21 : confessions of a @entity25 , @entity22 , 62 , from @entity23 , explains how he became a spirit medium and psychic entertainer , then later used these skills to ‘ scam the scammers			1
i thought ; " if they can do it i can , " ' says @entity22 of his book @entity21 : confessions of a @entity25 @entity22 started his 25 - year career in the ' magic of the mind industry ' , performing in clubs , theatres , and at many corporate events			1
he says his act was entertainment - based and that he never promised he had genuine magical or spiritual powers			1
talking to @entity49 and @entity50 on this morning , @entity22 explained how he used his skills to infiltrate those that did claim to have these gifts			1
he said : ‘ people want answers			2
i saw how easy it was and saw it happening			1
i thought ; “ if they can do it , i can			2
” ’ @entity50 questions @entity22 on his expose of psychics and mediums on this morning , as part of their @entity64 ‘ so that ’s where the ideas came to get in , to infiltrate and write the book to expose it			1

’ @entity22 unveils the scams that thousands of psychics use , including ‘ @entity76 , ’ where mediums claim to have superior psychic knowledge but it ’s actually based on nothing at all			1
by examining their client ’s body language and observing what @entity22 says are their , ‘ random generalities , ’ the mediums can quite easily find that person ’s vulnerability			1
‘ once you get the hook , everything else falls into place , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s all pretty standard stuff			2
’ the more recent trend of seeing a psychic over @entity95 throws up another common scam that many people are n’t aware of			2
in the @entity99 the customer will pay in advance by credit card for the psychic session , upon which the ‘ psychic ’ on the other end will not only receive the money but be able to see the payer ’s itemised credit card history			0

‘ in pitch black you can suggest all sorts of things			0
‘ linking hands creates incredible tension			0
people want stuff to happen			0
it ’s easy to feel a cold breeze or tap on the shoulder and think no one is in the room			1
it ’s a simple but traditional con			0
’ @entity22 justified what he did , saying that performing at an event or children ’s birthday party and charging money for the entertainment was one thing , but giving people false hope and leading them to believe things that they actually had no claim over was very different			1
‘ it ’s ok to go to a party and get a palm reading , you do n’t expect them to get a hook in you , ’ he said			0
‘ but you ’re told that you need another reading , you need to buys this candle , it ’s a scam			0
