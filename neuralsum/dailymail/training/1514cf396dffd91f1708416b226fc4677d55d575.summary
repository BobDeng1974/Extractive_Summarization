we ’ve had treadmill desks and even human hamster wheels , each designed to stop us sitting for hours on end			0
but the latest design , dubbed @entity6 , turns the user ’s whole body into a mouse so even when they ’re sat down , they ’re still moving			0
sensors built into the exoskeleton design recognise pressure and movements , which are then used to control an on - screen pointer			1
the @entity6 ( pictured ) was created by designer @entity16 from @entity17			1
programmer @entity18 then translated these physical movements into on - screen ones			1
sensors in the seat detect pressure , range of movements and angles and moving the hips , for example , scrolls through pages the dynamic chair was created by designer @entity16 from @entity17 , with help from programmer @entity18			1
it was designed and built for mr @entity16 ’s ‘ creatures with creations ’ research project			2
‘ although our bodies are evolved to move , we tend to design objects based on monofunctional use and posture , ’ explained mr @entity16			0
sensors in the seat detect pressure and the angle of the body , while accelerometers measure and track the movement of the user ’s legs			1
these movements are interpreted digitally , using software created by mr @entity18 , and are translated into movements on screen			1
for example , moving the hips and lowering the body ’s centre of gravity , for example , scrolls through pages and moves the mouse around the screen			2
kicking the left and right leg corresponds with left and right clicks , and in the future , arms could control swipe pages and open windows			1
‘ furthermore , as technology takes over more functions that formerly required exertion on our part , we are left with a less useful body			0
‘ we relegate our movements to leisure time			0
' movement becomes a choice and a lifestyle , segregated from our regular lives			0

‘ full body movement correlates with feelings of happiness , ’ said mr @entity16			0
' and yet , we spend days sitting behind a computer ' this vision is demonstrated in a video that accompanies the researcher project			0
to master the type and range of movements , mr @entity16 studied dancers at the @entity120			2

’ to make this more dynamic , mr @entity16 ’s exoskeleton chair allows the body to move freely			2
‘ with this chair , our bodies are once again functional , stimulating regular movement			0
' after all , that ’s what we were designed to do			0
’ the prototype chair does n't register arm movements , because arms are typically used to type			2
but , in the future , mr @entity16 imagines arm movements being used to swipe pages and open windows ( demonstrated )			1

dynamic chair was created by @entity142 designer @entity16 and @entity18
@entity144 translated physical movements into on - screen ones
sensors in the seat detect pressure , range of movements and angles
moving the hips , for example , scrolls through pages and around the screen
kicking the left and right leg corresponds with left and right clicks
in the future , arms could control swipe pages and open windows
