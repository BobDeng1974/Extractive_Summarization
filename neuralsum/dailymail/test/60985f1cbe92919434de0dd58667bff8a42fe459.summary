mr @entity12 called his mother , @entity22 ’ daughter @entity21 , 49 , who rushed to the hospital and pleaded with nurses to step in			1
it was not until an hour had passed that mrs @entity2 was finally assessed by a doctor , who realised she had suffered a stroke and arranged for her to be taken to a stroke unit at @entity28			1
however , she never regained full consciousness and died two weeks later			2
crucially , her oxygen levels were not checked until she was seen by the ambulance crew – 90 minutes after mr @entity12 raised the alarm			2
