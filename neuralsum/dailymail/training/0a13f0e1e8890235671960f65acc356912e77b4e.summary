most @entity3 have ‘ lost any real connection with the land ’ and many are ‘ increasingly suspicious ’ about farming , prince @entity0 has warned			1
while people still treasured the countryside , he said , they should not take it for granted or benefits such as landscapes and local food could be lost			1
in a foreword for @entity12 to mark his 66th birthday this week , the prince wrote : ‘ unlike in most parts of the continent of @entity17 , many people in the @entity3 are now four or more generations removed from anyone who actually worked on the land – and it frequently shows in their attitudes			1
the @entity0 , who says that many @entity3 have lost any real connection with the land '			1
he was pictured last night visiting an exhibition at @entity27 in @entity28 the @entity0 urged people to value and protect the countryside or risk losing its landscapes and local foods forever ‘ they have only a vague understanding of what farming is or does ; and – as outsiders looking in – they are increasingly suspicious of it			1
’ on a more positive note , however , he maintained that people still treasured the countryside and urged them to value and protect it or risk losing its landscapes , farmers , village pubs and local foods forever			2
the prince wrote : ‘ one of the things that strikes me most forcibly is the extent to which the majority of the population has lost any real connection with the land			1
' @entity0 also warned that if people continue to take the countryside for granted the nation risks losing an irreplaceable part of its landscape , community and economy			2
@entity0 also warned that if people continue to to take the countryside for granted , it would affect the economy he added : ‘ the rich , natural tapestry that is the countryside we value so highly does not just happen by itself			2
but that delicately woven tapestry is facing unprecedented challenges			0
‘ start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed , and is very difficult to put back again - no farmers , no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls ; no thriving rural communities , no villages - or village pubs ; no local markets , no distinctive local foods ... somehow , we need to find a way to put a value on our countryside , with all its facets			0
’ and he once again highlighted the importance of farmers , insisting : ‘ i simply can not see a viable future for the countryside that does not have the farmer - and the family farmer is a vital element in this - as food producer , at the front and centre of the picture			0
the prince makes the comments in a foreword he wrote for the new edition of @entity12 , which marks his 66th birthday ‘ it would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land , it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long term			1
