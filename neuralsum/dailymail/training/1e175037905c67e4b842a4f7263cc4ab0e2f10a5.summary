@entity1 ’s eyes blazed with furious intensity			1
he glanced up towards the familiar faces that have long accompanied him on these journeys to gladiatorial extremes			0
‘ do n’t worry about him , ’ he muttered			0
‘ he does this all the time			0
@entity9 wins the @entity10 all the time			1
he beats @entity1 all the time , too ; certainly of late			1
these qualities , combined in @entity12 , became close to irresistible			0
@entity9 does this all the time			1
what does he do ? he does @entity1			1
if this felt different to those other occasions it was because a third @entity20 title was within @entity1 ’s grasp			1
that may sound strange , considering he lost the fourth and final set 6 - 0			1
@entity9 won his fifth @entity10 title on sunday after beating @entity1 in @entity12 @entity1 eyes up @entity9 and his @entity10 trophy during the post-match presentations champion @entity9 ( left ) lifts the trophy while @entity1 ( right ) lifts the second place gong @entity1 shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in @entity12 following his defeat , @entity1 sat down and promptly smashed two of his rackets on the ground yet @entity1 was serving to go 5 - 2 up in the first set tie - break , he won the second set and was a break up in the third			1
he failed , he said , because he became distracted			0
and what distracted him ? that thing @entity9 does all the time			1
he was referring to a spell in the third set when his opponent gave every indication of being on his last legs			2
he limped , he grimaced in pain , he fell awkwardly after a couple of points , almost as if his knees had given way beneath him			0
it looked like a serious injury			0
@entity1 said he was under the impression @entity9 was cramping			1
and he let that news affect his game			0
by the time he realised @entity9 was either a gifted thespian , or had powers of recovery that would make @entity62 look like a hypochondriac , the momentum had been snatched away			1
@entity9 came roaring back , hence @entity1 ’s urgent desire to refocus			1
from appearing to be on the brink of conceding the match — in spirit , if not literally — @entity9 shed his woolly outer layer and bared his teeth			1
he won the last nine games of the match , straight , turning 3 - 3 into 6 - 3 in the third and winning the fourth set to love			1
it is his fifth @entity10 title , bettered only by @entity76			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , claimed not to be greatly distressed by the bagel			1
it was the third set that troubled him			2
@entity9 lifts his trophy after wining a remarkable fifth title in his fifth final in @entity82 @entity1 congratulates 2015 @entity10 champion @entity9 after the match ‘ in the fourth he was ripping everything , going for everything and it was going in , ’ he said			1
‘ he got a break up and just let loose			0
the third was more frustrating			0
i let what was happening at the other end bother me			0
’ this may seem a strange explanation			0
what , after all , is so bad about being a break up and feeling your opponent was about to capitulate ? well , exactly that			0
@entity1 said he started feeling too good about the way the match was going and for 10 minutes his focus dropped			2
‘ maybe the occasion had something to do with it , ’ he added			0
in a nutshell , he fancied his chances of at last landing this prize after three losing final appearances			2
he let himself get sucked in and by the time the real @entity9 showed himself , @entity1 had settled into a complacent groove			1
he has played in enough matches not to surrender concentration and has indeed been accused of a similar tactic by rivals , exaggerating injuries or discomfort to encourage a false sense of security			0
@entity118 no 1 @entity1 returns a serve during the opening set of the @entity10 final @entity1 slams his racket down in the net in anger after being broke in the second set within reason , there are no rules against it			1
@entity9 did n’t exactly take a dive and if @entity1 was mentally preparing his winner ’s speech when he should have been staring down the no 1 player in the world , that is a tactical blunder of grand proportions			1
he will know better next time			0
and there is bound to be a next time			0
what can not be ignored , amid the disappointment , is how far @entity1 has come since back surgery last year			2
if he ran out of resistance here , it was probably because the first three sets had taken three hours and 12 minutes to complete , and @entity9 was making his usual demands , physical and mental			2
the baseline rallies were quite immense			0
the difference between the elite quartet that dominate modern tennis , and the bulk of the field , can be measured in time			0
it might take three or four returns to gain a point from @entity154 or @entity155			0
@entity9 insists on greater investment			2
he uses the initial flurry of returns to get his range			0
@entity161 slugfests are required just to secure a lousy 15 - all			2
the first set took close to one - and - a - quarter hours to complete			2
both went to tiebreaks , and @entity1 ’s regrets will begin there			2
he raced into a 4 - 2 lead in the first , and was serving to secure a three - point advantage			1
what a time to record his first double fault of the match			0
a lengthy rally then ended with @entity1 hitting the net and he was long for the next point			2
from serving to lead 5 - 2 , he was now 5 - 4 down			1
the shot that surrendered the set — 7 - 5 in the tie - break — was a tame return from @entity9 ’s second serve			1
@entity1 had got into a winning position but had failed to win ; against incredible competitors like @entity9 , such profligacy rarely goes unpunished			1
yet , first , the revival			0
@entity1 took the second set after another mighty struggle that at one stage saw @entity9 win 13 consecutive points			1
@entity9 saved a set point with the score at 5 - 4 and just when @entity1 had four set points in the tie - break he hit arguably his poorest shot of the day , long with the court wide open , having manoeuvred his opponent into @entity197			1
he recovered and closed it out 7 - 4 but the next 39 minutes decided the match			1
@entity1 began the third set by breaking @entity9 ’s serve but then fell under his spell			1
@entity9 sprinted to the net but fell over and he later appeared to stumble forward as if afforded no balance when he served			2
yet , reviewing the match , there were clues that this might be a temporary condition			0
@entity9 ’s passing shot to secure his first point of the set was so magnificent , @entity1 exclaimed ‘ oh no ’			1
when he broke back to level the score at 2 - 2 , @entity1 was so unnerved he struck a ball high through the gap in the open roof of @entity215			1
with the scores tied at 3 - 3 , @entity1 earned a break point with an exquisite forehand pass			1
@entity9 saw saving that game — he played a neat drop shot at the net to take it to deuce — as the turning point of the match			2
he won every game from there and soon @entity1 was striking the ground with his racket in frustration			2
fans of the @entity118 no 1 show their support at the @entity215 in @entity82 on sunday @entity1 's fiancee @entity232 looks up at the big screen in @entity12 after they notice her choice of top the @entity118 no 1 connects with a backhand shot during the second set in sunday 's @entity10 final naturally , @entity9 ’s explanation for his revival was considerably more innocent than @entity1 ’s claim that he was hoodwinked			1
‘ at the start of the third set , i was in trouble , ’ he said			2
‘ i needed to regroup and get back on track			0
i started coming to the net more , shortening the points , because i was exhausted			0
i had no reason to call a time - out because i was not injured , but i just felt weak			0
i had a physical crisis			0
the first two sets had taken the energy from me			0
‘ i have n’t felt like that too many times in my career			0
there was a lot of emotion , a lot of tension , but it was a @entity20 and i was n’t going to give up			0
when we played in 2013 it was a similar match , very long from the start , and i felt i had the physical edge over him so i used that memory			0
‘ i had to earn the right to win and the willpower got me to where i am now			0
i think in these matches the mental strength plays the most important role			0
there are a lot of things that can influence your state of mind when you are down — but i was n’t aware that @entity1 got distracted			2
’ the packed @entity215 in @entity12 during the final of the 2015 @entity10 crowds gathered at @entity279 in @entity12 to watch the final on big screens put like that , so succinctly and simply , it is hard to dispute @entity9 ’s version of events			1
he was exhausted by a quite superb game of tennis — he also caught a virus during a recent tournament in @entity290 which may have left its mark — but dug deep and recovered			0
the final set was extraordinary			2
in both his semi-final against @entity294 and against @entity1 in the final , @entity9 has claimed victory with a 6 - 0 finish			1
breaking @entity1 for the second time , to take the score to 3 - 0 , @entity9 lifted his racket as if giving the arena permission to begin their celebrations			1
the job duly completed soon after , @entity1 shook hands , returned to his chair and stared straight ahead			2
‘ do n’t worry about him , he does this all the time , ’ he may have reasoned ; but it will have been scant consolation in the circumstances .			0

@entity9 beat @entity1 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) , 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) , 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 in the @entity10 final
@entity1 led 4 - 2 in the first set tiebreak but a *succession* of errors cost him
the victory was world no 1 @entity9 's fifth @entity10 title in his fifth final
