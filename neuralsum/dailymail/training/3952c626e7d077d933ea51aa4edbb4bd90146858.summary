by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity3 commentator @entity2 has explained his pronunciation of @entity7 talisman @entity6 ’s first name after coming under fire on social media			1
rather than adopting the @entity11 pronunciation ‘ @entity12 ’ of the name that adorns the back of the 23 - year - old ’s shirt , @entity2 instead used the @entity17 take on @entity6 during @entity7 ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity19 on saturday evening			1
writing in a guest blog for @entity27 , @entity2 justified his decision : ‘ i am in the identification business , i am not a linguist			0
believe it or believe it not , i do try to get pronunciations correct			0
and , yes , in his native @entity11 language @entity6 becomes ‘ @entity25 - reeg - ez ’			2
' the complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native @entity11 speaker , or any other ‘ speaker ’ but plain @entity17			2
clarification : @entity3 commentator @entity2 , pictured here with @entity38 at @entity39 , has explained his reasons for pronouncing @entity7 star @entity6 in an @entity17 manner star of the show : @entity7 's @entity6 has lit up the @entity44 , scoring five goals on his team 's march to the quarter - finals ‘ if some of the most famous of the household names at this @entity44 were to be pronounced totally correctly , familiar players like @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 would suddenly sound rather unfamiliar			1
' so , at the risk of upsetting the multi-linguists , i admit that i do lean towards ‘ @entity60 ’ names for popular consumption			1
i believe it is far more important not to misuse words such as ‘ tragedy ’ and ‘ disaster ’ in football commentary			0
‘ but pronunciations will continue to divide and infuriate			0
i remember @entity67 working with @entity3 as a @entity44 panellist and saying that the guttural sound of his surname is simply not one that @entity17 speakers make			0
' i have steered clear of trying to refer to @entity72 as ‘ @entity73 - zontsscchhh ’ because my clumsy attempt at speaking @entity75 would probably still be wrong , so why pretend ? stunner : @entity6 's volley against @entity19 ranks as the best goal of the tournament so far tongue twister : @entity81 legend @entity67 said the guttural sound of his surname is not one that @entity17 speakers can easily make ‘ so i will not be intentionally trying to wind anyone up when i shout ‘ @entity84 - reeg - ez ’ on friday			1
' personally , i think it would be a little perverse to refer to a man with ‘ @entity89 - @entity88 ’ on his back as anything other than ‘ @entity84 ’ on @entity93 television unless a different pronunciation of his name had been long established – particularly as he was happily scoring goals for @entity97 in @entity98 two years ago as ‘ @entity84 - reeg - ez ’ on our channels			0
’ @entity2 , who has been @entity3 ’s lead commentator since the retirement of @entity102 after the @entity44 1998 , also vowed to continue with his anglicised pronunciation in the upcoming games at the @entity105 in @entity106 .			2

@entity3 commentator was *criticised* for pronouncing @entity6 's first name in @entity17 way rather than @entity11 ' @entity12 '
@entity2 defended his *choice* , saying many other names would also have to change
he wrote : ' i admit that i do lean towards ‘ @entity60 ’ names for popular consumption '
