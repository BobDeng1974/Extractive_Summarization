when a @entity2 lawyer asked the @entity3 for tax - exempt status for a mentoring group that trained high school and college students about conservative political philosophy , the agency responded with a list of 95 questions in 31 parts , including an ultimatum for a list of everyone the group had trained , or planned to train			1
' provide details regarding all training you have provided or will provide , ' the @entity3 demanded			2
' indicate who has received or will receive the training and submit copies of the training material			0
' that question was part of the tax collection agency 's february 14 , 2012 letter to @entity27			0
founder of the group @entity28 of @entity31			1
he had submitted his application 13 months earlier			0
' can you imagine my responsibility to parents if i disclosed the names of their children to the @entity3 ? ' he asked @entity40			1
it 's ' an impossible question to answer fully and truthfully , ' he said , ' without disclosing the names of anyone i ever taught , or would ever teach , including students			2
' three of the more than 90 questions the @entity3 posed to @entity28 , including ( # 24 ) the demand for a list of everyone the organization had trained , or planned to train - all of whom would be students in college and high school @entity57 press secretary @entity56 faced hostile media questions on tuesday , including many about the fast - brewing @entity3 scandal			1
he maintained that the @entity57 had no knowledge of the @entity3 's practice of targeting conservative groups like the leaders of many tea party - affiliated groups whose tax - exemption applications have become the subject of angry complaints , @entity27 called the @entity3 's inquisition an overreach , ' especially considering that my organization mentors high school and college students			1
' it ' should send chills through your spine , ' he told @entity40 , ' that the government would ask me to identify those i teach , and to provide details of what i teach them			0
' the 13 - month delay , while burdensome , was far shorter than those some other groups endured			0
according to a report released late tuesday by the @entity3 's @entity88 , the average delay at one point was 574 days			1
but @entity27 said a $ 30,000 grant was canceled as a result of the @entity3 's months - long radio silence , when he could n't tell his donor that @entity96 had earned its 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax - exempt status			1
that money would have made a significant difference to the group , judging from its public filings in @entity2			2
in 2011 , @entity96 of @entity31 reported collecting just $ 3,460 in contributions , and spending $ 7,328 on its programs			0
@entity27 said his group , @entity28 , should never have been caught up in the @entity3 's anti-conservative dragnet			1
the @entity3 inspector general issued a report on tuesday largely clearing upper - echelon officials in the @entity112 administration the group 's online materials refer to it as ' an @entity116 leadership development enterprise			1
' its stated purpose is to mentor high school and college students , placing an emphasis on @entity122 civilization and an old - style core curriculum - what previous generations called the ' great books			1
' ' our ideas are opposed to the @entity112 administration , but we ’re not tea party , ' @entity27 told @entity129			0
it 's that lack of a tea party connection , he said , that makes his predicament so maddening			2
he told @entity40 that nothing about his group - ' not our name or our description or our website , or anything ' - should have placed it among the organizations the @entity3 chose to scrutinize closely by using key words like ' tea party , ' ' 9/12 , ' and ' patriots ' as qualifiers			1
' i 'm not a @entity150 group			0
i 'm not a @entity152 group by name ' he told @entity154 5 in @entity155			0
' we mentor high school and college students in conservative political philosophy			1
it 's a one on one relationship			0
' attorney general @entity161 said tuesday that he ordered a @entity163 investigation into the @entity3 's targeting of conservative groups for extra tax scrutiny			1
he will face questions on wednesday from @entity168 in a @entity170 hearing @entity171 summed it up in an interview with @entity40 as ' unethical , unconstitutional , and unfair , ' later asserting in an email that ' [ w ] e were targeted by the @entity3 based on our political beliefs and the content of our speech			2
' the @entity180 , which represents 27 conservative groups including @entity28 , is planning to file suit against the @entity3			2
@entity183 , that organization 's chief counsel , wrote on tuesday that ' the @entity3 abuse is ongoing			2
' ' even though the @entity3 admitted wrongdoing , ' @entity183 wrote in an essay for @entity188 , even though the inspector general ’s report indicates that wrongdoing was widespread , the @entity3 still has n’t withdrawn its overbroad and unconstitutional questions , and it still has n’t granted the exemptions it should grant , despite the fact that some applications have been pending for more than two years			1
' the inspector general 's report includes a list of ' the seven questions ' the @entity3 asked right - wing groups that were later ' identified as being unnecessary			1
' its request for the list of students trained by @entity28 was not among them			2
the report also largely exonerates political appointees in the @entity207 and at the top of the @entity3 , instead blaming mid-level bureaucrats for providing ' ineffective management ' and using ' inappropriate criteria ' to red - flag conservative groups			1
it makes no mention of anyone in the @entity57 directing the @entity3 to play political favorites			2
but the @entity216 has reported that ' senior @entity3 officials ' in @entity218 were notified of the practice in 2011			0
the @entity3 inspector general identified just seven questions that were ' unnecessary , ' among the hundreds asked of tea party groups and other conservative organizations that sought tax - exempt status in december of that year , @entity27 says , he called the @entity3 's nonprofit evaluation arm in @entity227 , @entity228 , to find out why his group 's application had taken so long			1
the agent on the other end of the line , he said , told him , ' we are waiting on guidance from our superiors as to your organization and similar organizations			0
' attorney general @entity161 has said that he ordered the @entity240 to initiate a criminal probe on friday , when he learned about the @entity3 's practices			2
the @entity3 's actions , he said , were , ' certainly outrageous and unacceptable , but we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations			0
' @entity161 is expected to testify in a @entity248 hearing on wednesday in @entity218			0
on friday the @entity249 will hear testimony from acting @entity3 commissioner @entity251 and treasury inspector general @entity252			1
@entity254 @entity253 senator @entity253 has called for @entity251 to lose his job			0
@entity183 ( r ) is threatening to sue the @entity3 on behalf of his conservative clients , while sen. @entity253 ( @entity257 ) has asked treasury secretary @entity258 to fire the acting @entity3 commissioner ' at a bare minimum , those involved with this deeply offensive use of government power have committed a violation of the public trust that has already had a profoundly chilling effect on free speech , ' @entity253 wrote monday in a letter to treasury secretary @entity258			1
' such behavior can not be excused with a simple apology			0
' ' it is clear the @entity3 can not operate with even a shred of the @entity116 people ’s confidence under the current leadership , ' @entity253 continued			0
' therefore , i strongly urge that you and president @entity112 demand the @entity279 ’s resignation , effective immediately			0
' on friday , @entity183 demanded that the @entity3 immediately approve the tax - exempt status applications of his organization 's 10 legal clients , including @entity28 , that are still waiting			1
he issued the agency an ultimatum : @entity285 the requests by noon on may 17 , or prepare to fight in court			0
' we are demanding that the @entity3 grant our remaining clients tax - exempt status immediately , ' @entity183 said in a statement			0
' if that does not occur by friday , we will advise our clients of their right to sue the @entity3 for the redress of their grievances			0

*federal* government demanded a list of everyone a @entity2 organization had ever trained , or planned to train
@entity305 of @entity31 mentors high school and college students and teaches them conservative political philosophy , but is not tea - party - linked
' can you imagine my responsibility to parents if i disclosed the names of their children to the @entity3 ? ' asked the group 's founder
@entity3 inspector general report listed seven questions the agency should never have asked , but this was n't one of them
