new track : the hologram performed @entity15 , a new song off the posthumous album @entity18 amazingly realistic : the hologram even did the moonwalk while dancers were beside it , and fire shot out around it @entity144 's attorney @entity143 said his clients were disappointed with the ruling , but the lawsuit will continue			1
' it 's only the very beginning of a case that will continue to be prosecuted by my clients , and ultimately they are confident that they will prevail and will recover all available damages for the defendants ' infringing conduct , ' @entity143 said			0
