by @entity0 and @entity1 the mother of a severely disabled boy denied a life - changing operation on the @entity5 has today thanked hundreds of people who donated to help her raise £ 10,000 to pay for the procedure			1
@entity9 has already been forced to watch one son die in agony from @entity12 - helpless to relieve his pain			1
so after hearing a second son had the same rare and terminal condition , she found some solace when doctors said a new operation could relieve his agony			1
@entity20 , 13 , has lost most of the movement in his muscles , meaning he is in constant pain and confined to a wheelchair			1
terminally ill teenager @entity25 was denied @entity5 funding for an operation to reduce his pain			1
but thanks to hundreds of @entity31 readers donating money to his fund , the youngster will be able to have the procedure privately in the four days since @entity20 's story appeared on the @entity31 readers helped raise more than £ 6,000 to take his fund past the @entity9 's target of £ 10,000 @entity20 ( pictured with his parents , @entity40 and @entity41 ) has a very rare genetic condition called @entity12 , which has already killed one of his brothers but just weeks before he was due to have the operation , @entity5 bosses refused to pay due to funding cuts			1
the denial inspired mrs @entity9 to take matters into her own hands , setting up an appeal to gather the money together			1
with £ 3,000 already in @entity20 's fund , his story appeared on @entity31 last week , sparking a flood of donations			1
in just four days readers touched by @entity20 's plight raised more than £ 6,000 to take his fund past the £ 10,000 his family need to pay for the operation			1
mrs @entity9 said she has been humbled by the kindness shown by people from across the country			2
she told @entity31 : ' it very humbling , truly amazing			2
it restores your faith in people			0
' it was so nice to see @entity20 's story touching so many people			1
it just shows there are so many good , caring people in this world			0
' i want to thank everyone who has donated , it means the world to us			0
' ' my husband is not an emotional man , but even he had tears in his eyes reading all the messages left and seeing all the donations			0
' it was @entity31 that gave @entity20 's fund the big push it needed			1
it is amazing the reaction we have had			0
' she said raising the money so quickly means @entity20 will be able to have his life - changing operation this summer			1
' i want to thank everyone who has donated , it means the world to us ' - @entity9 while the procedure wo n’t save his life , it could prolong it significantly and at the very least make it a lot more comfortable			1
mrs @entity9 , 45 , said : ‘ all we want to do is make @entity20 as happy and pain - free as possible and they ’ve ( @entity5 ) taken that from us			1
‘ it breaks my heart to hear him cry out in pain at night and not be able to do anything about it			0
there is nothing worse for a mother			0
’ it is not known how many weeks , months , or years @entity20 has left to live , but a child with the genetic disorder is only expected to live to the age of around six or seven			2
the mother - of - two , who lost her son @entity41 to the disease at the age of just four on christmas eve in 2000 , said : ‘ it makes me angry that a topless model is allowed to have a boob job on the @entity5 for cosmetic reasons or someone can have a tummy tuck , but a poorly child has to suffer			2
’ @entity20 ( pictured as a child with his older brother , @entity128 , who has asperger syndrome ) has lost most of his movement as a result of his illness and it causes him extreme pain ‘ if a child is in pain and something can be done about it , how they can be denied treatment ? ’ @entity20 ’s @entity141 first recommended the procedure , called selective dorsal rhizotomy ( @entity144 ) , which is often also used to treat children with cerebral palsy			1
in october last year he was put on a waiting list for the operation at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
but they received a letter in the post in february , weeks before he was due to have the operation , saying due to @entity5 funding cuts they could no longer fund it			1
aspring glamour model @entity157 sparked outrage after her @entity5 - funded boob job - which has since been reversed - on the @entity5 as the @entity161 reported earlier this year , while children such as @entity20 - and many suffering with cerebral palsy - are being refused funding for life - changing surgery such as a selective dorsal rhizotomy , there is plenty of cash to pay for cosmetic procedures			1
the case of @entity157 sparked outrage when it emerged she had received breast enlargement on the @entity5 - and , after tiring of her new assets , a tax - payer funded reduction , too			2
ms @entity157 had her @entity178 breasts enlarged to a @entity179 with taxpayers ’ money , after saying her flat chest was ‘ ruining her life ’			0
her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local gp			2
under @entity5 guidelines , cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘ to protect a person ’s health ’			1
then there was the case of morbidly obese @entity194 , who cost the @entity5 £ 15,000 by having a gastric band fitted - then having it removed when she decided she preferred being fat			2
' we were all excited about it and getting ready for it , ’ she said			0
‘ we have tried to fight it , tried to re-appeal saying @entity20 is a special case but they just said a blanket “ no ” response			2
it ’s like talking to robots			0
‘ the people making these decisions are n’t from a medical background , so there ’s no talking to them			0
’ mrs @entity9 and her husband , @entity41 , 52 , who live with @entity20 and his brother , @entity128 , 20 , who has @entity217 , were forced to try and raise the money themselves and set up @entity20 's fundraising page online			1
mrs @entity9 added : ' the initial joy does give way to sheer panic , as well			2
' being a mother , now i am worrying about @entity20 going into hospital and having the operation , it is only natural i suppose			1
@entity20 , a ‘ happy child ’ given his circumstances and a @entity232 fan , spends his life in a wheelchair and is unable to sit up by himself			2
the teenager , who is much smaller than most boys his age , has very stiff limbs and one leg is stuck in one position , causing him extreme pain			0
@entity20 ( pictured with his parents ) was offered surgery to reduce his pain by cutting some of the nerves in his back			1
however , the offer of @entity5 funding was then withdrawn due to funding cuts @entity20 's parents , @entity40 and @entity41 ( pictured with their other son , @entity128 ) , are now trying to raise £ 10,000 to pay for him to have the operation very little is known about the inherited disorder that affects the central nervous system and there is little by way of treatment			1
the @entity144 operation is the only way @entity20 ’s pain can be relieved without the risk of serious side - effects			1
it works by cutting the nerves in his back , enabling his limbs to move more freely and therefore making him a lot more comfortable			2
mrs @entity9 , who with her husband is a full time carer for her two boys , but also volunteers to help other parents with disabled children , said : ‘ because he is in so much pain , he is not sleeping			1
‘ it ’s all about energy and when they get tired , they ’re more prone to getting infections and then their health goes downhill			0
‘ at the moment he has fits most evenings which is very frightening which keeps him awake			0
’ mrs @entity9 ( pictured with her husband and sons , @entity20 and @entity128 ) says it is unacceptable the @entity5 will pay for weight loss surgery and for boob jobs but it will not pay for surgery to relieve the suffering of a dying teenager mrs @entity9 ( pictured with her husband , @entity41 ) said : ' all we want to do is make @entity20 as happy and pain - free as possible and they 've taken that from us ' @entity12 is a severe neurological disorder which usually starts to show symptoms during the first year of life			1
it causes the progressive loss of mental abilities and of movement			0
it is usually fatal within a couple of years as it causes respiratory failure			0
severe muscle and movement problems then develop and these cause loss of feeling in the limbs , weakness and balance problems			0
eye , heart and breathing problems are also common in people with @entity12			0
the symptoms are caused by patches of damaged tissue that develop in the brains of patients and these lesions are often accompanied by the loss of the nerve coatings			0
this reduces the ability of the nerves to activate the muscles used for movement and to relay sensory information to the brain			0
the condition occurs in about one in 40,000 babies			0
the condition is caused by mutations in one of more than 30 different genes			0
source : @entity337 @entity20 can only say a few words as the condition also affects the respiratory system			2
but mrs @entity9 said if it was n’t for his condition , @entity20 would be ‘ a typical 13 - year - old ’			1
‘ he ’s such a character and very mischievous , ’ she said			0
‘ he likes the baddies in films			0
most kids are frightened of @entity347 and @entity348 but from a young age he just thought they were funny			0
’ there have been several cases this year where poorly children have been refused funding due to cuts			2
in march two - year - old @entity356 who suffers with cerebral palsy was told she could n’t have an operation that would help her walk			0
a @entity161 campaign helped raise the money so she could have the operation			2
meanwhile , around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the @entity5 each year and in 2012 it spent £ 3.5million on 790 breast implant operations			2
it is estimated @entity12 occurs in one in every 40,000 live births , though certain populations have considerably higher rates			0
@entity371 , @entity372 , for @entity373 said : ‘ our exceptional funding request to @entity375 for @entity20 ’s surgery was unsuccessful			1
we continue to meet with the family as they explore self - funding @entity20 ’s surgery			1
’ visit www.gofundme.com/8i3518 contribute to @entity20 ’s @entity144 fund .			0

@entity25 , 13 , has a rare genetic condition called @entity12
it has caused him to lose most of his movement and is extremely painful
he was offered surgery to reduce the pain by cutting nerves in his back
but the offer of surgery was then withdrawn due to @entity5 funding cuts
as a result , @entity20 's parents launched an appeal to raise £ 10,000 to go private
in four days @entity31 readers helped the @entity404 surpass their target , raising £ 6,000 , meaning @entity20 can have his operation this summer
mother @entity9 said : ' i want to thank everyone who donated '
