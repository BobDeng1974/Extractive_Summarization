the word schmeat – a form of meat produced synthetically from biological tissue – made it on to the shortlist for the @entity7 ’ word of the year			2
the word is rarely used , but its very inclusion in the shortlist reflects the long - term significance of the events that occurred in @entity12 in august , when the world ’s first lab - grown hamburger – developed by a team at @entity17 in the @entity18 – was cooked and served			1
it ’s a vital development , because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult			1
the @entity22 ’ @entity23 estimates that demand for meat will increase by more than two - thirds over the next 40 years			2
burgers could soon be both healthy and sustainable produced , according to dr @entity28 , a food scientist the @entity18 scientists responsible for the first schmeat predict ‘ cultured ’ meats ( ones grown artificially ) could be commercially available within 10 to 20 years			1
‘ with the current technology , we can make the meat at a reasonable price and that will only come down as we improve the production process , ’ says lead scientist professor @entity34			1
‘ there are still a few technical hurdles , but they require just work and time , and the outcome is reasonably predictable			2
’ although the team say synthetic meat is biologically the same , it will need to replicate its appearance closely to tempt doubters			2
cultured beef is currently white , and coloured using beetroot			0
professor @entity53 ’s team are now working on cultivating fat tissue and increasing levels of the pigment myoglobin , which gives meat its colour			0
this would offer a more authentic flavour and appearance			0
but beef patties are n’t the only part of our diet to attract the attention of food scientists			0
in the future , every aspect of a burger – from the bun to the relish – could be modified to make it more sustainable			0
what ’s more , it could even become something of a health food			0
the science is tantalisingly close to delivering , but any new gm foods would have to overcome a raft of regulations , particularly in @entity83			0
in @entity12 in august , the world 's first lab - grown hamburger ( pictured ) - which was developed by a team at @entity17 in the @entity18 - was cooked and served health - boosting purple tomatoes a team from the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , has engineered tomatoes using genes from the snapdragon flower to give an extra helping of pigments called anthocyanins			1
these have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body			1
in tests , the tomatoes slowed the progression of soft - tissue carcinoma in cancer - prone mice			1
the tomatoes and juice will not be available commercially until regulatory approval , which could be as soon as two years in @entity111 , says lead researcher professor @entity112			1
cultured beef muscle stem cells from cattle have been cultured in a nutrient broth by researchers at @entity17 in the @entity18 , and then mixed with collagen so they formed strips of muscle tissue – the main component of meat			0
these were then ‘ bulked up ’ with electrical stimulation , before being minced up and shaped into a patty			0
a total of 20,000 muscle strips are needed to create just one burger			0
dr @entity129 says creating lab grown meat ( pictured ) is a vital development because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult diabetes - treating lettuce dr @entity136 , a molecular biologist at the @entity137 , works on delivering drugs using plants			1
he has created lettuces genetically engineered to express a protein that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin			1
tests on mice given freeze - dried ‘ super lettuce ’ have shown promising results			1
allergy - free milk milk allergies are often caused by a protein called beta - lactoglobulin ( @entity153 ) , which is not present in human milk			0
a @entity156 team has used genetic engineering to create a cow that produces @entity153 - free milk			0
they are currently creating more cows with the same genetics using reproductive technologies analogous to human @entity164 treatment			0
the article is featured in this month 's edition of @entity168 magazine @entity169 in 2012 , scientists from the @entity92 , @entity171 and the @entity172 deciphered wheat ’s complex genetic code , identifying about 96,000 genes			1
the work paves the way to breeding wheat varieties with higher yields , more disease resistance , and increased ability to cope with drought and other climate - related stresses			0
creepy - crawly cuisine is coming insects are highly nutritious and heading to a dinner plate near you			1
the idea of eating tangles of muscle from a @entity192 dish may be unpalatable to some			0
even less appealing , however , may be the idea of devouring insects , deep - fried or otherwise			1
yet in restaurants from @entity12 to @entity197 , insects are proving quite a hit with a niche audience keen to eat delights such as grasshoppers , locusts , crickets and scorpions ( heat - treated , of course , to remove the toxins )			1
insects actually form part of the traditional diets of at least two billion people worldwide , according to @entity210 ( @entity23 ) of the @entity22			2
there ’s no escaping the fact that they are good for you			0
a recent @entity23 report points to the benefits of eating insects			2
they are high in fat , protein , fibre , and key minerals and vitamins , from iron and calcium to b vitamins and vitamin @entity226 crucially , insects have a negligible impact on the environment			2
they are cold - blooded and very efficient at converting feed to protein , not using energy to maintain their body temperature			2
they can also be fed on organic waste			0
so - called mini livestock also offer ‘ livelihood opportunities ’ , says a recent @entity23 report on edible insects , meaning they could also be an ethical choice			2

purple tomatoes with anti-inflammatory *properties* have been developed , says dr @entity28 , *writing* in the magazine @entity168
they can slow the development of some cancerous *tumours*
there is now lettuce that boosts the body 's production of insulin
insects , which are very nutritious , are increasingly *popular* in restaurants
