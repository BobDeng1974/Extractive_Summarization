@entity8 , 67 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has been refused the drug @entity11 , which could prolong his life by years			1
he is being treated 20 miles away at @entity14 in @entity15 , but doctors will not prescribe him @entity11 because he lives in @entity3			1
instead , they have advised him to move to @entity15 to gain access to the treatment			1
in a cruel twist , mr @entity8 , has received chemotherapy while a patient in the bed next to him receives the drug he has been refused			1
denied : @entity8 with his grandson , @entity23			1
mr @entity8 has been told by doctors that he should move to @entity5 to get the cancer drug @entity11 , which could prolong his life by years @entity8 ’s daughter , @entity27 , said : ' to see the patient next to him having that treatment and him being denied it you just think what has he done to deserve that ? it ’s awful			1
' he ’s effectively being treated as a second class citizen because he ’s @entity3			2
his daughter @entity27 said : ' he ’s effectively being treated as a second class citizen because he ’s @entity3			2
' the decision contradicts many other parts of @entity3 ' healthcare system , where all citizens get free prescriptions			2
mr @entity8 's family say they are desperate for him to receive the drug and are appalled at the situation			1
@entity11 is one of the first of a new generation of ' targeted ' cancer drugs			1
it avoids the scatter - gun approach of chemotherapy , which kills healthy as well as cancerous cells			0
instead , it focuses on the protein involved in supplying tumours with blood , interfering with their work			0
alongside chemotherapy , it can shrink and remove tumours			0
one of its many advantages over other treatments is that it is extremely well tolerated by patients			0
the drug is available to patients in @entity5 but three requests to @entity66 from doctors at the @entity14 have been declined			1
the @entity69 family say they are being treated as second class citizens because they live in @entity3 , not @entity5			1
clockwise from left : mr @entity75 's son @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , mr @entity8 senior and his wife @entity69 mr @entity8 was initially diagnosed with an inoperable liver tumour in 2011			1
but after seeking a second opinion from one of the country ’s top liver specialists , he was advised that @entity11 could vastly increase his life expectancy			1
in a further frustration , he has also been refused @entity90 chemotherapy and without that or @entity11 he is not eligible to take part in medical trials which could also prolong his life			1
his son , @entity95 , said : ' we just want him to be treated as an equal			0
we all feel really let down			0
my dad is always thinking of others , in the winter he would always be out early clearing the roads and pavements when the snow came			0
' during the summertime he would be out doing gardening for the elderly			0
now we just want to give something back to to him			0
' his daughter added : ' it breaks your heart			0
there ’s a patient in the bed next to him and you are seeing the nurses there giving them @entity11 , just because they live somewhere else			2
' it ’s dreadful , it ’s so upsetting			0
we just want the best treatment that ’s out there			0
we want other people to be aware of what the situation is			0
it should n’t be like this and we hope it wo n’t be for other people			0
' a spokesperson for @entity130 told @entity131 it was ' not happy to discuss individual patients with the press '			2
to make matters worse , mr @entity8 's grandson eight - year - old grandson @entity23 is embroiled in his own postcode lottery battle			1
his hopes of reconstructive surgery have been dashed because @entity3 ’ health service will not fund the operation in @entity5			1
mr @entity8 is being treated 20 miles away at @entity14 in @entity15 , but doctors will not prescribe him @entity11 because he lives in @entity3			1
instead , they have advised him to move to @entity15 to gain access to the treatment @entity23 , who lives in @entity144 , was born with @entity145 – a congenital deformity where the outer ear does not fully develop			2
until now , he has been treated for the condition at @entity149 ( @entity150 )			0
his operation was due to take place at @entity150 after he had reached his seventh birthday but it now refers all patients to a specialist at a private hospital in @entity157 – with the @entity158 paying for operations			0
an application for the operation was made in june , however , it was turned down because @entity23 lives in @entity3			2
@entity23 ’s parents , @entity164 and @entity95 , have now been told the operation can take place in @entity166 – but only if a funding application to the @entity168 is approved			2
however , if @entity23 lived in @entity5 he would be referred to the specialist in @entity157 leaving @entity164 furious at what she says is second class treatment			2
his parents have called on the @entity173 to rethink its policy of giving out free prescriptions if it can not afford to provide proper healthcare for its people			0
mr @entity8 said : ' i do n’t understand why all prescriptions are free why do n’t they just charge £ 2 and by the end of the year they would have raised thousands ' ' @entity23 told me : " @entity183 , i just want an ear , i just want to be like everyone else " , it rips your heart out			1
' his mother @entity164 said : ' it ’s reconstructive surgery , not cosmetic surgery it ’s not fair on him , he just wants to look like all his friends .			0
