a distraught elderly couple are facing @entity1 apart because ‘ box - ticking ’ social workers refuse to let them spend it in the same nursing home			1
@entity5 , 84 , and his wife @entity6 , 70 , have been told they must be separated after more than 50 years of marriage because of council protocol			1
mr @entity5 , a retired hotelier , had been living in sheltered housing next to the nursing home that looks after his wife , who suffers from dementia			1
but after a stroke in october , he now needs round - the - clock care and can not leave his hospital bed to visit her			1
@entity5 , 84 , and his wife @entity6 , 70 , face @entity1 apart after 50 years of marriage because of social workers will not let them stay in the same care home doctors recommend that mr @entity5 join his wife in her home – but social workers say he must go to an ‘ assessment centre ’ for around six weeks instead			1
despite the fact that he can not walk , dress himself or visit the bathroom , @entity25 maintain that his ‘ needs ’ may not meet the correct criteria for a place			2
the @entity32 ’ 49 - year - old daughter @entity31 , a psychotherapist , said : ‘ @entity33 and @entity34 desperately want to be together			2
they ’ve been soulmates all their lives			0
i do n’t know how long either of them have left so every week that passes is precious			0
@entity34 has become very depressed			0
@entity33 is missing him and has even asked if he was dead			0
it ’s heart - breaking			0
‘ keeping them apart is nothing but a box - ticking exercise			1
’ the couple met in @entity44 more than 50 years ago , and have worked all their lives without claiming benefits			1
mr @entity5 , an @entity47 , fell in love with his @entity50 wife ‘ at first sight ’ when she came to work in the same hotel as him			1
soulmates : the @entity55 ' at their wedding in 1964 they married in 1964 and raised two children – @entity31 and her brother @entity58 , now 44 – while running the family hotel in @entity60 , central @entity44			0
but after the couple retired to @entity65 , mrs @entity63 was last year diagnosed with late stage dementia , and was forced to move into @entity67			1
she took comfort from the presence of her husband , who visited every day , made friends with staff and came to view it as a second home			0
but following his stroke two months ago , the medical team at @entity77 say he can no longer live alone and recommend that he joins his wife			0
as well as mobility issues , mr @entity5 has poor eyesight , poor hearing , failing kidney function , diabetes and high blood pressure			1
in a letter to social workers , a hospital consultant said : ‘ in my opinion , mr @entity5 would greatly benefit from a place at @entity67			1
this would enhance his well - being and reunite him with his wife , which would help support his emotional needs			2
’ but despite pleas from mr @entity5 ’s family , the council said he must go to another institution , @entity99 , for ‘ assessment ’ instead			1
and after an examination period likely to last at least six weeks , there is no guarantee he will be allowed the funding for a £ 650 - a - week place with his wife			2
a letter from social services said the process ‘ is used to assess all service users where it is not clear what support they will need upon discharge ’ , adding that ‘ the hospital is not a natural environment to establish someone ’s needs ’			0
it means the couple could be forced to live in separate care homes for the rest of their lives , as mr @entity5 does not have the means to fund his own place at @entity67			1
their daughter added : ‘ my parents have been hard - working taxpayers all their lives and never asked for anything			2
my mother actually did n’t claim her pension for some years			0
‘ they would n’t dream of claiming benefits and have always been self - reliant			0
i feel they ’ve earned this care in their hour of need			0
all my dad can say is that he hopes @entity138 lets him live long enough to look after @entity33			0
it breaks his heart that she ’s slowly disappearing without him there			0
’ a spokesman for the council said they ‘ are very sympathetic to the circumstances of @entity5 and mrs @entity63			1
we are working closely with the family to ensure they are provided with the appropriate support when he is well enough to leave hospital			2
’ @entity63 has created an online petition highlighting her parents ’ plight here			2
