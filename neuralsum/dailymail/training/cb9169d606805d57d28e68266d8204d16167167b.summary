by @entity0 @entity1 is profiting from the controversial drinking game @entity2 by displaying adverts next to videos of people taking part in challenges			1
the social networking site is now facing growing pressure to ban footage after the craze claimed the lives of two @entity15 men this weekend			1
last night , a @entity1 page called @entity17 started by friends of the latest victim had 24,000 ‘ likes ’ and relatives condemned the game as ‘ stupid and dangerous ’			1
victims : @entity25 , 29 , left , and @entity26 , 20 , right , both died on sunday after drinking huge amounts of alcohol campaigners also called for the site and others to review their policies on allowing the videos to remain online			1
@entity34 of @entity35 said : ‘ @entity1 have declined to take these pages down			2
i would ask them to look at reviewing their policy			0
‘ i would also urge people who are using these social networking sites and who see these particular pages , to report them to the site and complain			0
’ his warning came after the deaths of two @entity15 men this weekend after apparently taking part in the game – in which participants film themselves drinking dangerous and bizarre alcoholic cocktails and urge others to outdo them			0
two other young men died in @entity52 last week			0
the first @entity15 victim was former grammar school boy @entity26 , 20 , who downed wine , whisky , vodka and lager in a pitcher and lost consciousness two minutes later			2
foolish : triathlete @entity61 , pictured above , contributed to the craze by uploading a video of himself trying to drink a beer while cycling down the street he died in hospital in the early hours of sunday			0
friends said he had told them he wanted to ‘ outdo ’ everyone else			0
yesterday it emerged that @entity25 , 29 , from @entity71 , also died on sunday morning after being @entity72 and downing a pint of vodka			2
friends said he liked to challenge people to drinking contests and his catchphrase was : ‘ do you wan na race ? ’ they have now started a @entity1 group called @entity81 and called on the social networking site to check related videos before they are uploaded			1
a family spokesman said : ‘ we want to tell other people to think what they are doing before taking part in something stupid like this			0
' we do n’t want to see any more victims of this drinking craze or for any other families to suffer			1
’ mr @entity25 ’ mother @entity94 , 49 , said : ‘ @entity25 was a fabulous son – he was kind , generous and funny , everybody loved him			2
craze : other extreme @entity81 examples include grandmother @entity99 , who downed a cocktail laced with laxatives , and @entity102 , 19 , who stripped to her underwear in an @entity105 store to drink beer ' the community here will not be the same without him – he would do anything to help anybody			0
’ the craze has taken hold on @entity1 primarily , but is also on sites including @entity115 and @entity116			1
although @entity1 has removed advertising on @entity81 groups and does not show targeted advertising linked to the craze , it is still running adverts alongside the videos			1
this means that it is either paid by a company up front to run the adverts , or it receives money when a @entity1 user clicks on the link			2
a spokesman said behaviour on the site that some people may find offensive or controversial is ‘ not always necessarily against our rules ’			1
he added : ‘ we encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case - by - case basis			0
‘ we also give people the ability to remove themselves from an uncomfortable conversation through tools such as untagging and blocking			0

site faces pressure from campaigners and victims ' families to ban videos
warning comes after @entity25 and @entity26 die in craze
@entity1 says @entity157 are ' not necessarily against our rules '
