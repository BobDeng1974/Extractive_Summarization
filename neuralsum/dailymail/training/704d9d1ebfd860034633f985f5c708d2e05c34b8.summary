one hundred years since @entity1 and @entity2 first locked horns , it was n't @entity4 , @entity5 or one of the modern household names on offer that separated the @entity9 rivals			1
instead , it was a 29 - year - old striker by the name of @entity12 who settled the so - called ' friendly ' in @entity1 's favour to salvage some much - needed pride after a dismal @entity15 on home soil			1
two shots and two goals were enough to justify him sporting the no 9 shirt on saturday in @entity22 's first @entity21 , but who exactly is the @entity25 man ? sportsmail examine the @entity26 who remains adamant the 2018 @entity15 is his next target			1
the 29 - year - old 's last name is , in fact , @entity61			1
but the veteran has gone by @entity12 ever since emerging from the youth ranks at @entity37 a decade ago at the age of 19			2
there , he was sent on loan to @entity67 's @entity40 , @entity1 's @entity42 and @entity68 's @entity45 to cut his teeth			2
the @entity71 club are notorious for giving the original @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 early chances in their prestigious careers , and @entity12 was hungry for the same in @entity78			0
but it has been @entity80 that truly backed the striker in his two stints at the @entity26 club			0
@entity12 , after an initial spell between 2009 and 2011 , remains at the @entity86 in @entity87 and has nine goals in 19 appearances so far this year in @entity90			1
he is named after @entity2 's 1986 @entity15 winner @entity55 and @entity57 's 1982 winner @entity56 @entity55 ( left ) holds the @entity15 trophy in 1986 while @entity12 ( right ) celebrates his win for @entity57 in 1982 @entity12 may not be the youngest in the @entity1 starting @entity94 , but he was n't the oldest ! 31 - @entity95 ( gk ) 30 - @entity96 29 - @entity12 , @entity97 , @entity98 27 - @entity99 , @entity100 26 - @entity101 23 - @entity102 , @entity103 22 - @entity5 a little old , is n't he ? @entity12 , born in 1985 , was surrounded by youth in @entity1 's attack on saturday			1
to name a few , @entity5 is 22 , @entity102 , 23 and @entity101 , 26			0
nevertheless , @entity12 , a fast - paced attacker by nature , was gifted his seventh international cap by @entity30 after a strong start to the season and made it count with his first goals in the yellow of @entity1			1
the man born in @entity117 received his first call up in 2009 from @entity30 , but never managed to get further than finding himself on the back - up list for @entity1 at the @entity120			2
and last year he revealed his disappointment in not being given a chance by @entity123			0
now , though , @entity30 is back at the helm and seems willing to back the veteran			0
@entity12 , substituted in the 83rd minute for 2002 @entity15 - winner @entity126 , repaid his new manager 's faith in @entity22			1
@entity12 was substituted in the 83rd minute for 2002 @entity15 - winner @entity126 , a man three years his senior @entity1 manager @entity30 is back at the helm and seems willing to back @entity25 's veteran @entity12 @entity12 high fives @entity1 's substitutes after netting his first and second international goals of his career £ 635k - @entity46 to @entity25 £ 5.9m - @entity25 to @entity47 £ 5.5m - @entity47 to @entity48 £ 4.1m - @entity48 to @entity25 so , what 's he worth ? when @entity12 returned to @entity25 from a fairly successful spell at @entity48 in @entity139 , the @entity26 club 's president @entity136 announced it cost about £ 4.1million			1
in fact , it was his own mum , @entity141 , who revealed the transfer on @entity143 , writing : ' i 'm very happy ! my son is coming back to @entity146 ( @entity25 's nickname )			0
thanks , @entity148 ! ' @entity12 's stock has slightly dropped in value as his career has developed , but he looked as clinical as any other on saturday with two well - taken goals against @entity154 of @entity2			1
the first , a volley that found the far corner beyond frustrated goalkeeper @entity157 after sloppy @entity159 defending			0
the second , a typical goal poacher 's header			0
@entity12 scored two decent goals - the first a volley to the far corner and the second a quick - reaction header @entity12 's heat map in @entity169 's @entity168 shows the striker got about but was n't always in the box so , 2018 @entity15 ... ' it 's a unique feeling , ' @entity12 reportedly said after netting his brace			1
' scoring my first goal for @entity1 , and against who ? @entity33			0
then i even got my second			0
' my goal is to play @entity15 2018			2
i need to enjoy the moment now			0
i want to celebrate with my family , with my wife			0
' @entity12 will be 33 when the next @entity15 in @entity182 rolls around			2
though arguably be too old to beat others to a call - up , the striker refuses to give up on what he sees as his ultimate reward			2
@entity1 manager @entity30 gave @entity12 his first international call - up in 2009 and still has faith in the 29 - year - old			1

@entity12 scored two goals for @entity1 as they beat @entity2 2 - 0
the 29 - year - old plays for @entity25 in @entity1 and is named after @entity15 - winning duo @entity55 and @entity56
@entity12 remains adamant he wants to *compete* for a place at the 2018 @entity15 , but the striker will be 33 when the *tournament* arrives
