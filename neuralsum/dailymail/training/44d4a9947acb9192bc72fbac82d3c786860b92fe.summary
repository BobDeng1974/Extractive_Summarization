she said : ' when i look back at pictures now , i think it 's quite scary , how did i let myself get like that ? it was not great for my children , i was always tired			0
' it got to the point where my health was really starting to suffer			0
if i left it any longer , it was just going to get worse			0
' last january , i was always tired , carrying around an extra eight stone			0
i would be always conscious of my size , but quickly make a joke at my own expense			2
' inspiration : mrs @entity5 holds a pair of her old jeans as she prepares to start a new @entity38 group to encourage other women to tackle their weight problems mrs @entity5 is now urging other women with weight problems to make a @entity4 resolution in the hope they can turn their lives around without surgery , crash diets or becoming , in her words , a ' gym bunny '			1

' it 's very much eat well , everything in moderation , exercise more			0
' everyone with a weight problem will know they want to lose weight , but doing it is another matter			2
' if you had a bad week , you feel like walking out the door - stay and get the support of the people there , everybody is in the same boat			2
' mrs @entity5 is now a consultant and is set to begin running her own @entity50 in @entity11 in the near future			2
