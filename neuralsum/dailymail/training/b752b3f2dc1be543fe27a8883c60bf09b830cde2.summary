by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 6 september 2013 a father has ordered his family to spend a year living like it was 1986 by banning all modern technology after fearing gadgets were spoiling his children			1
@entity7 made the call to carry out his ' social experiment ' after his son @entity10 , five , said he preferred to stay indoors and play games on an @entity12 rather than go outside on a hot summer day			1
so @entity7 , remembering when he was a child and how it was impossible to keep children sitting quietly indoors , decided to go back in time and give his kids a taste of life in the year he was born			2
playtime : @entity7 is converting sons @entity21 , left , and @entity10 , right , to the simple joys of old fashioned fun after banning modern technology since april , the @entity26 , from @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , have given up all modern technology with @entity7 even growing a mullet			1
the family have no internet or 24 - hour news channels			1
instead they have an old 1980 's tv set encased in a wooden cabinet and a ' ghetto blaster ' cassette player blaring 80 's classics			0
they have thrown out their mobile phones , post real letters instead of sending emails , and knock on people 's front doors instead of following them on @entity47			1
when travelling they use a map to navigate instead of using a gps navigation system and use film - based cameras to capture special moments			0
most of their friends have been supportive of their experiment but @entity7 , 26 , revealed some simply ca n't give up technology even when visiting the 1986 household			2
stepping back in time : @entity7 has brought his family back to 1986 after shunning all modern technology - including @entity63 blast from the past : @entity7 has been getting used to using an outdated ' ghetto blaster ' and living without 24 - hour news channels , @entity47 and emails as he sees if life was better without modern technology he said : ' it feels weird - it feels like we have really gone back in time			1
the strangest thing without having a cell phone is that i could almost feel my pocket vibrating and wanted to check my pocket			0
' at the same time the experience has brought the family closer and given us an opportunity to talk to each other a lot more			2
' i 'd like to think i 've been touching a lot of lives just through the people that i 've met when they see me and the way i look			0
' they will stop to take pictures of me and talk to me - they think what we 're doing is really cool			0
' some wo n't catch on though			0
i even have a ' cell phone box ' inside the front door of our house and whoever wants to enter has to leave it there for the duration of their visit			0
' in fashion : @entity7 's social experiment to take his family back to 1986 even extends to adopting a mullet which was fashionable at the time			2

@entity26 gave up internet , news channels , mobile phones and @entity47
