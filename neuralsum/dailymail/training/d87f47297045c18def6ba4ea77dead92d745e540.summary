the shaking of @entity2 heads said it all			2
@entity5 ’s side trudged off the field at the @entity7 after a victory that felt more like defeat			1
such a performance against the @entity11 next week will only end one way			2
the @entity13 will provide a far more brutal assessment of @entity2 mettle than this spirited @entity17 bunch who survive on a shoe - string budget and almost snatched a famous victory – despite playing just under half an hour with 14 - men after a red card to @entity23			1
if @entity5 and his selection panel were using this fixture as a trial ahead of the @entity29 , then only full back @entity24 put his hand up			1
too many of his colleagues in the red jersey were anonymous and the big guns – notably @entity34 and @entity35 – will be welcomed back to the starting xv with open arms			2

‘ now we ’ve got to look forwards and be excited about next week			0
the @entity11 made 13 changes for @entity117 and they will probably make another 13 changes against us			1

’ whether @entity120 hooker @entity119 will be among those retuning remains unclear			0
the @entity122 left camp in a protective boot on tuesday but declared himself fit to play against @entity126 on friday night			0
his decision riled the @entity2 coaches and stern words will be had tomorrow morning			0
‘ he was in a boot earlier in the week and was n’t available for selection , so he needs to go back to @entity120 , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ it was a surprise to us that , on wednesday , he presents himself to @entity120 as being fit to go on the bench			0
sometimes the player needs to be stronger and that ’s the conversation we ’ll have next week			0
’ his jersey was filled by @entity140 and the @entity142 hooker triggered the line - out that set up the opening try			1
@entity39 dominated the catch and drive throughout , a rare positive from the performance , and provided the platform for the first try from @entity38 in the seventh minute			1
@entity149 missed the kick and it was not the nerve - settler the @entity153 had hoped for , following the booing of the low - confidence player against @entity156 last week			2
his dropped ball five minutes later almost allowed @entity43 through to level the score , but the presence of @entity45 was enough to force a knock on from 6ft5in winger @entity161			1
@entity162 ( c ) fed @entity163 for the pass that led to @entity39 opening try @entity45 touches the ball down for @entity39 ' opening try after a superb move from the hosts involving @entity24 the @entity170 winger wheels away after giving @entity39 the lead in front of an ecstatic home crowd @entity174 frees the ball from the scrum as @entity39 dominate early proceedings in @entity48 @entity49 dives over the line to score @entity39 second try in the first - half - his fourth consecutive score for his country @entity49 gives @entity39 the flying start they were searching for by scoring a second try for the @entity184 @entity49 races away from @entity43 's @entity186 after touching the ball down for @entity39 @entity39 8 ( 17 ) 109 607 10 16 24 22 8 7/8 14/19 73/76 57 % 61 % tackles ( missed ) carries metres clean breaks offloads kicks ( hand ) turnovers pens against scrums won lineouts won @entity197 possession territory @entity43 100 ( 36 ) 100 479 6 19 31 17 12 3/6 9/10 56/57 43 % 39 % wales survived and within the opening quarter they were two tries ahead			1
@entity174 took a quick penalty and it was finished by @entity49			1
. then any structure in play quickly disintegrated			0
@entity43 have become the forgotten team in the ‘ group of death ’ , but there were reminders in @entity48 that they should not be taken lightly			1
in the first half , they won eight turnovers to nil against the hosts and , following a snipe from scrum half @entity217 , they narrowed the deficit with two penalties from giant centre @entity221			1
‘ we ’ve only been together for a short time but we ’ll have a 35 - day camp leading up to the @entity227 , ’ said @entity43 coach @entity223			1
‘ we will get better and better with the more time we spend together			0
’ it was a closer contest than many had expected			0
@entity43 had limited preparation and their squad , many of whom smoke , earn just £ 80 a day while playing in the white jersey			2

the @entity251 managed not to concede during @entity23 ’s sin - bin period , after his re-introduction , the @entity254 player was shown a second yellow for taking out @entity257 at the lineout			2
@entity43 put up a spirited resistance with 14 - men and , after @entity262 ’s try was overruled , @entity79 landed one last blow with an 80 - metre interception try to set up a twitchy finale			1
