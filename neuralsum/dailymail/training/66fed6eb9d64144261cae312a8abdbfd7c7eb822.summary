two new moons have been discovered orbiting @entity1 , bringing the planet 's total number of known satellites to 67			2
and , at just two kilometres in diameter , one of the moons may be @entity1 's smallest known satellite			1
the two distant moons - @entity10 and @entity11 - were discovered during routine tracking observations of already known satellites in september 2010			1
they were then re-observed by scientists several times that autumn			0
two new distant moons of @entity1 - s / 2010 j 1 ( circled ) and @entity11 - were discovered during routine tracking observations of already known satellites in september 2010 with @entity1 now having 67 known satellites , the discovery of two tiny moons does not have a large bearing on our understanding of the system			1
their size has been estimated based on their brightness			0
s / 2010 j 1 is 3km in diametre , while s / 2010 j 1 is estimated to be just 2km in diameter			1
it is believed that nearly all moons the size of @entity10 or larger are known			2
but as there are always a lot more small moons than large moons , there must be dozens of satellites in the 1 - 3 km class			1
the researchers , whose study is published in @entity43 , claim their finds confirm this			0
and as @entity11 is the faintest , and thus smallest , @entity49 satellite discovered to date , its discovery confirms that the planet 's satellite population does continue down to those sizes			1
researcher @entity53 , from the @entity54 , said : ' it was exciting to realise that s / 2010 j 2 is the smallest moon in the @entity58 that was discovered and tracked from @entity59			1
. @entity56 1 orbits with an average distance from @entity1 of 23.5million kilometres and has an orbital period of 2.02 years			2
s / 2010 j 2 has a semi-major axis of 21million kilometres and an orbital period of 1.69 years			0
the irregular satellites of the giant planets are clustered in ' families ' with similar orbits and colours			0
these families are believed to have formed as a result of ancient collisions of passing - by comets or asteroids with former larger moons			2
@entity10 was discovered on images taken by the @entity78 - inch @entity77 by an international team led by @entity80 astronomers @entity81 and @entity82 , and @entity54 astronomy professor @entity83 and phd student mr @entity53			0
@entity11 was spotted on images taken with the @entity86 camera at the 3.6m @entity90 - @entity89 - @entity88 telescope by @entity92 executive director and director @entity93			0
upon later inspection , @entity11 was also weakly visible in the images taken just days earlier by @entity78 .			0

one of the moons - s / 2010 j 1 - is just 2km in diametre
it is the smallest known @entity49 satellite
