his dorky haircut , sweater - vest , puffy smile , squint and braces made him an unexpected online phenomenon - but the real - life ' @entity7 ' is actually a church builder named @entity10			1
while his image is re-purposed constantly online by anyone wanting to illustrate the depths of incompetence or sheer misfortune , @entity11 , 25 , quietly works away for the family construction business in @entity18 , @entity19			1
his high school photo , taken when he was 16 , is the visual accompaniment to jokes such as ' @entity25 bullet - proof vest ... gets shot in the face ' , ' has a pet rock ... it runs away ' and ' hires life coach ... benched '			2
behind the meme : @entity11 , left in his normal life , found a joke yearbook photo ( right ) turned into a vision of incompetence and misfortune after it found its way online it has also personally earned its star $ 20,000 in royalties from big - money ad campaigns in the @entity40 and across the world , the @entity36 reported			1
the snap shot to fame after a friend uploaded it to the @entity47 forum in 2012 and is struck a chord with the other users , and he joined the ranks of others whose images became inexplicably famous and repeated millions of times			1
@entity11 explained that he was a class clown and made the photo ridiculous on purpose - he bought the sweater from a thrift store , rubbed his cheeks red before posing then pulled a stupid face			1
indeed , the picture was so obviously silly that the school principal would n't let it in the final cut of the yearbook			0
but @entity11 and a school pal , @entity67 , took a digital copy of the picture that would eventually secure his fame - though it would take six years for @entity67 to eventually share it with the world			2
lucrative : exposing himself to mockery worldwide has brought in as much as $ 20,000 for @entity11 ' famous ' : @entity11 , seen here wearing a t - shirt of himself , has found himself less in demand of late - but still gets the occasional call it made its way to t - shirts , stuffed animals and novelty items sold bu the likes of @entity83 and @entity84 , while companies like @entity86 , and others as far away as @entity88 and @entity89 paid up to use his pictures in their ad campaigns			1
the deals , which he negotiated himself , made him an estimated $ 20,000 , and @entity11 tried to capitalize on his internet kudos even further by filming videos about his character			1
he even traveled to @entity97 for a ' date ' with another meme character - @entity99 , or @entity100			0
while the two did n't fall in love , the resulting video was watched more than 2million times			0
but , he told the @entity36 , his fame and profitability had an expiry date			0
while he first video was viewed 350,000 times , interest waned fast			0
his latest effort , from december old , has attracted an audience of fewer than 10,000 , and his monthly @entity114 earnings now rarely breach $ 100			0
now that the internet has turned its attention elsewhere , @entity11 is left with his job as a project manager for church construction			0
he recently adopted a dog			0
he considers the picture ' something to show my grandkids one day ' - and in the meantime does everything he can to give @entity7 one last outing whenever another fan comes calling .			2
