in the future , when your phone battery is running low , you could charge it using your sweat			1
researchers have developed a small temporary tattoo that strips electrons from lactate produced by our bodies during perspiration			1
at the moment , the energy it harnesses is just enough to charge a small biobattery , but the team are working on ways to use the technology to charge smartphones and tablets			1
this is used to charge a small biobattery			2
currently , the battery produces around 70 @entity28 per square centimetre of skin , but the researchers are working on a way to harness more energy to charge phones or tablets the device works by detecting and responding to lactate , which is naturally present in sweat			1
‘ lactate is a very important indicator of how you are doing during exercise , ’ said lead researcher @entity39 from the @entity41			2
during strenuous physical activity , the body needs to generate more energy , so it activates a process called glycolysis			2
@entity51 produces energy and lactate			1
researchers imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto temporary tattoo paper			2
the sensor contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate , generating a weak electrical current			1
this current can be used to power a sweat - powered biobattery			1
batteries produce energy by passing current , in the form of electrons , from an anode to a cathode			1
in the case of the patch , the anode contains the enzyme that removes electrons from lactate , and the cathode contains a molecule that accepts the electrons			1
the maximum amount of energy produced by a person in the low - fitness group was 70 @entity28 per square cm of skin			1
by comparison , a phone uses between two and six watts			0
there are 1,000,000 @entity87 in a watt so the technology is still a way off from achieving that sort of power			0
in general , the more intense the exercise , the more lactate the body produces			1
during strenuous physical activity , the body needs to generate more energy , so it activates a process called glycolysis			2
@entity51 produces energy and lactate , the latter of which scientists can detect in the blood			2
professional athletes monitor their lactate levels during performance testing as a way to evaluate their fitness and training program			0
in addition , doctors measure lactate during exercise testing of patients for conditions marked by abnormally high lactate levels , such as heart or lung disease			2
currently , lactate testing is inconvenient and intrusive because blood samples must be collected from the person at different times during the exercise regime and then analysed			2
ms @entity125 , a postdoctoral student in the lab of professor @entity128 , and her colleague imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto temporary tattoo paper			0
the sensor contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate , generating a weak electrical current			1
the researchers applied the tattoo to the upper arms of 10 healthy volunteers			0
they then measured the electrical current produced as the volunteers exercised at increasing resistance levels for 30 minutes			1
during strenuous activity , the body needs to generate more energy , so it activates a process called glycolysis			0
@entity51 creates energy and lactate			0
researchers imprinted a flexible lactate sensor onto tattoo paper			0
the sensor ( pictured ) contains an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate , generating a weak electrical current they could then continuously monitor sweat lactate levels over time , and with changes in exercise intensity			1
ms @entity125 and her team then went a step further to build a sweat - powered biobattery			0
when 15 volunteers wore the tattoo biobatteries while exercising , they produced different amounts of power			0
interestingly , people who were less fit , exercising fewer than once a week , produced more power than those who were moderately fit , exercising one to three times per week			0
enthusiasts who worked out more than three times per week produced the least amount of power			0
earlier this year , @entity177 teamed up with @entity179 - based @entity178 to create a range of digital tattoos the size of a penny that stick to a person ’s wrist , or other body part			0
by linking the circuits in the waterproof patch ( pictured ) to a phone , users can unlock devices simply by holding them near their wrist the researchers said this is probably because the less - fit people became tired sooner , causing glycolysis to kick in earlier , forming more lactate			1
the maximum amount of energy produced was 70 @entity28 per square cm of skin			1
by comparison , a phone uses between two and six watts			0
there are 1,000,000 @entity87 in a watt so the technology is still a way off from achieving that sort of power			0
‘ the current produced is not that high , but we are working on enhancing it so that eventually we could power some small electronic devices , ’ ms @entity125 said			2
‘ so besides working to get higher power , we also need to leverage electronics to store the generated current and make it sufficient for these requirements			0
’ the team presented their findings at the @entity219 of the @entity220 ( @entity220 ) .			0

the patch works by detecting lactate , which is naturally found in sweat
the more intense the exercise , the more lactate the body produces
sensors contain an enzyme that strips electrons from lactate
this generates a weak electrical current which powers a biobattery
currently , the battery produces around 70 @entity28 per square cm of skin
but researchers are working on a way to harness more energy to charge *larger* devices such as phones or tablets
