it could be a snap taken from a fun filled family holiday , as a diver who is grinning from ear to ear swims in glorious blue waters wearing nothing but flippers , goggles and a pair of @entity11			0
but look closer and at that shadow lurking below and the scene becomes less one of happiness and more one of horror			0
that 's because the bold swimmer is actually a marine conservationist who has decided to take a dip with a great white shark circling ominously beside him			0
posed up : the relaxed diver spreads his arms in joy despite the fact that a 10 - foot killer is lurking in the shadows below closer look : the diver is part of a team of conservationists who take pictures on marine environments in a bid to boost conservation projects care free : the swimmer , sporting little other than some swimming equipment and a pair of @entity11 , came within touching distance of the shark while most will only share the killer fish 's natural environment with the help of a reenforced cage , this scientist is part of a team who feel quite at home floating withing touching distance of the powerful predator			1
they spotted the beast whilst swimming off the coast of the @entity56 in @entity57			1
the divers , who take underwater images of stunning marine environments to support conservation projects , documented their encounter with the shark in this series of stunning snaps			2
teamwork : he was joined by another photographer in a wetsuit who swam alongside the dangerous animals to capture the stunning images so close : the second snapper appears to take his life in his own hands as he reaches out to touch the great white 's tail unconcerned by the prospect of being torn to shreds by the deadly species which , up until 2012 , had been responsible for 69 human deaths , the care free swimmer and his camera crew happily circled the sedate beast			1
swirling among schools of fish , the photographers even posed alongside the beast , coming within inches of being able to pull its tale			2
sharks typically attack humans when they mistake them for seals or other marine animals which form part of their diet			1
they have been known to attack people to take ' test bites ' , with experts claiming a shark can tell whether or not a target is worth eating with one assault			0
in the deep : the shark was spotted off the @entity56 , @entity57 , where the the diver 's group @entity106 are promoting conservation efforts a @entity106 diver swims behind a great white shark in the @entity56 , @entity57 beauty : the circling great white weaved in and out of giant schools of fish creating this amazing scene the divers , from conservation group @entity106 , thankfully looked different enough from a fatty and protein rich seal for the shark to leave them alone			1
and while the beast was in a placid mood , the team went to work creating these stunning set of images			0
they will be used as part of the not - for - profit organisations ongoing battle to promote conservation of these warm water environments , where species such as the great white thrive			0
no mistake : thankfully , the shark did not mistake the diver in the black wetsuit for a seal , that mix up is often blamed for unprovoked great white attacks on his way : the divers could not resist one last reach towards the powerful animal as it swam off into the deep			2

divers from @entity106 swam within touching distance of the powerful predator
they were taking pictures off the coast of @entity57 when coming across the beast
the species , which have been responsible for 69 human deaths , can attack when they mistake humans for seals
