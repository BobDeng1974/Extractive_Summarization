@entity0 roused deflated @entity2 activists yesterday with a pledge to put the brakes on healthcare privatisation – despite a warning from the head of the @entity8 that it would be impossible			1
a day after @entity11 ’s lacklustre speech to his party ’s conference , the shadow health secretary received a series of standing ovations as he promised a ‘ rescue plan for a shattered service ’			1
but it emerged yesterday that @entity20 chief executive @entity19 had thrown a spanner in the works by writing to mr @entity0 to dismiss @entity2 ’s call to block all new contracts between hospitals and the private sector			1
in another blow for @entity2 , it was revealed that mr @entity11 ’s pledge of a cash boost for the @entity8 actually amounts to less than the budget increase granted by @entity54 every year she was in power			1
on tuesday , the @entity2 leader announced a new £ 2.5 billion fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 extra @entity59 , 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives			1
but the money amounts to an increase of just 2.2 per cent on the £ 111 billion budget planned by the government			1
while mrs @entity54 was prime minister , the lowest cash increase was 6 per cent – and between 1949 and 2010 , the average annual growth in @entity8 spending was 4 per cent			1
mr @entity0 used his speech to pledge that , if @entity2 wins power , carers will be given better support with funding for breaks and annual health checks			1
and there will be a new promise that everyone who wants to die at home rather than in hospital should be able to , if clinically possible			0
but much of the barnstorming address was an attack on what he claimed was the @entity85 ’ creeping privatisation of the @entity8 – even though he signed off on increased use of private firms to provide care when he was health secretary			1
@entity90 , who is standing to become a @entity2 mp in @entity92 , took her baby @entity93 on to the stage she was seen holding her son while trying to get conference organisers to let her address the audience @entity100 sources claim mr @entity0 has toughened up his position on privatisation to win support from the @entity104 of the party in anticipation of a leadership bid			2
‘ @entity0 ’s on manoeuvres , ’ said one			0
in his speech , mr @entity0 said : ‘ the party that created the @entity8 in the last century today sets out a plan to secure it in this			2
a rescue plan for a shattered service			0
miss @entity90 said she did not want @entity93 to grow up ' saying ' we used to have an @entity8 for all ' ‘ but more than that			2
a vision for a 21st - century @entity8 there when you need it , personal to you and your family , with time to care			2
' a national health and care service based on people before profits			0
today we place that proud @entity2 plan at the centre of our election campaign			0
’ mr @entity0 said that days into office in 2010 , ‘ the @entity85 set about dismantling your @entity8 ’			0
' and the plan that dared not speak its name before the last election is now plain for all to see : run it down , break it up , sell it off , ’ he said			0
‘ so today we serve notice on @entity31 and @entity138 : thursday , may 7 , 2015 – your day of reckoning on the @entity8			0
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ our ten - year plan for the @entity8 is founded on people before profits			0
we will free the @entity8 from @entity31 ’s market and , yes , repeal his toxic @entity143			0
' we will ask hospitals to collaborate once again and reinstate the @entity8 as our preferred provider			0
the public @entity8 , protected with @entity2			1
not now , not ever			0
’ @entity2 insists the government ’s restructuring of @entity8 commissioning , which came into force in 2013 , has led to privatisation by the back door			1
' but use of the private sector by the @entity8 doubled in the last four years of @entity2 , a far bigger increase than under the @entity156			1
since 2010 , a further 1.3 per cent of the @entity8 budget is spent in the private sector , with the total standing at about 6 per cent			2
in a letter to mr @entity0 , seen by the @entity160 , mr @entity19 flatly rejected his call for a moratorium on any new deals with the private sector as impossible			2
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ @entity31 ’s reorganisation forces the tendering of contracts , not the @entity169			0
‘ we still believe these large contracts should be halted until there ’s an @entity8 debate at the election			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity0 gave a passionate defence of the health service , urging @entity2 activists to ' battle for the soul of the @entity8 ' mr @entity0 's barnstorming speech stole the show at the @entity182 conference centre the positive reaction from activists came as the party was left reeling by @entity11 's meandering speech , in which he forgot whole sections on the deficit and immigration to promote his promise of £ 2.5billion for the @entity8 , mr @entity11 visited @entity191 today , but faced more questions about what he left out of his speech			1

*bookies* cut the odds on shadow health secretary becoming @entity2 leader
but health *supremo* @entity19 warns pledge is ' impossible '
receives standing ovation for passionate plea to save the ' soul of the @entity8 '
reaction was in marked contrast with @entity11 's lacklustre speech
labour promising £ 2.5billion fund to hire *36,000* more *doctors* and nurses
amounts to a 2.2 *%* annual increase , less than when @entity54 was *pm*
