@entity0 , one of the four people killed in the @entity4 murder two years ago today those responsible for the murders of four people including members of a @entity10 family in the @entity4 may got away with ‘ the perfect crime ’ , investigators conceded today			1
their chilling words come on the second anniversary of a bloodbath which has baffled detectives			0
it was on september 5 , 2012 that @entity18 engineer @entity0 , 50 , and his wife , @entity20 , 47 , died alongside her mother and a @entity23 cyclist			1
the @entity25 ' daughters , @entity26 , seven at the time , and @entity28 , four , survived the savage attack close to @entity30 , in eastern @entity23			1
‘ the further we advance , the less conviction we have , ’ conceded local prosecutor @entity31 , the @entity30 prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry			0
‘ it lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up			0
on a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track			0
’ mr @entity31 said that ‘ after two years ’ hundreds of people had been interviewed , thousands of documents read , and numerous forensic tests carried out ‘ but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out			1
’ conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come , mr @entity31 told @entity23 ’s @entity52 : ‘ we have tried everything possible , but we ’re perhaps we ’re in the presence of the perfect crime			1
’ detectives thought they had made a breakthrough in june when a 35 - year - old @entity59 convicted criminal was questioned for three days , but he provided an alibi			2
in another bizarre twist , it has emerged that mrs @entity63 had a ‘ secret ex-husband ’ who died in mysterious circumstances in @entity68 on exactly the same day as the quadruple killing			1
the @entity70 , from @entity71 , @entity18 , originally came from @entity59 , and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator @entity76 may be a reason for their murders			0
the scene of murder in the forest near @entity82 and @entity30 in the @entity23 @entity4 lt col @entity83 , one of the police commanders working on the case , has meanwhile raised the prospect of a ‘ family secret ’ which may have provided a motive for the murder			1
he said @entity89 was ‘ secretly married ’ to an @entity68 dentist 13 years her senior , identified only at @entity91 , between february 1999 and december 2000			2
the short relationship was ‘ never spoken about ’ and @entity93 died in @entity94 , @entity95 - on exactly the same day as the @entity4 killings - with one theory being that a poison dart was used to assassinate him , though the official cause of death was a heart attack			1
mrs @entity63 died next to her mother , @entity102 , 74 , while local cyclist @entity103 , 45 , was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car			1
there have been claims that mr @entity63 was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother @entity112 , 54 , of @entity113 , @entity18			1
@entity112 , 54 , the brother of murdered @entity114 , was arrested last year but released because of lack of evidence @entity112 was arrested last year under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence			1
@entity121 , a 48 - year - old old former policeman from the @entity30 area , also spent four days in custody over the killings in february			2
the gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking , but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders			0
investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman , and to know the local area extremely well			0
this has led to well - sourced theories that mr @entity103 , the cyclist , may have been the principal target			2
he had recently left his wife and two children to live with a multi-millionaire heiress , with whom he had just had a baby , and there were said to be tensions in the relationship			0
there have been accusations that the @entity23 authorities are involved in a cover - up , as they insist that mr @entity103 was just an unlucky passer - by who got caught in the crossfire			2
@entity26 and @entity28 , the surviving daughters , are now in the care of members of the @entity70 ' extended family			1
they have been given round - the - clock security because those responsible for the murders are still at large			0
@entity26 is certain to have seen those responsible , although she is not thought to have provided any kind of detailed description			2
the killings took place in an isolated lay - by on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of @entity82			0
a detective involved in the case said : ' the reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence , and disappeared without trace			0
it is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved			0

@entity114 and @entity89 died alongside her mother and a @entity23 cyclist
the @entity10 couple left behind two *young* daughters , @entity26 and @entity28
many have been arrested and hundreds interviewed , but to no end
mr @entity63 **'s** brother was arrested last year but later released
mrs @entity63 **'s** ' secret ex-husband ' died in @entity95 on the same day
