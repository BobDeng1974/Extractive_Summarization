@entity0 was brought on in the last minute of extra-time just for the penalty shootout @entity4 goalkeeper saved two of five spot - kicks to send @entity7 through @entity8 did the same last year when in charge of @entity10 he replaced @entity11 with @entity12 and the substitute was the hero in penalty - shootout win over @entity15 @entity16 has been lauded for his decision to bring on goalkeeper @entity0 ahead of @entity7 ’s penalty - shootout victory over @entity19 – but was he inspired by @entity8 ? the @entity21 boss replaced netminder @entity22 in the 120th minute of saturday ’s quarter - final in @entity24			1
and @entity4 stopper @entity0 proved the shootout hero , saving two penalties to set up a semi-final date with @entity29			1
‘ we thought it through			0
every player has certain skills and qualities and they do n’t always coincide , ’ he said			0
‘ we felt @entity0 would be the most appropriate keeper to save penalties			2
you would have seen that @entity0 dived to the right corner twice			0
we ’re a tiny bit proud this trick has helped us through			0
’ but @entity47 is not the first manager to pull such a stroke of genius			0
former @entity10 boss @entity8 upset his @entity65 when he was replaced by 19 - year - old @entity12 in the closing stages of the @entity67 semi-final against @entity15 in 2013			1
@entity69 's the man : @entity10 goalkeeper @entity12 saves from @entity15 's @entity70 during the @entity72 semi-final mastermind : @entity8 brought on @entity74 especially for the penalty shootout but @entity12 , like @entity0 , emerged as the hero when he kept out @entity15 ’s @entity70 to help send the @entity77 through			1
@entity11 , though , had not been aware of @entity8 ’s plan , and the manager said : ‘ i probably should have told my goalie before the game it was going to happen			2
‘ @entity12 has been fantastic at penalties all his career , and it worked , he saved one			2
’ @entity10 were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity86 in the final , by which point @entity8 had been replaced by @entity89			1
but @entity8 had been the brains behind the passage to @entity93 – we wonder if mr @entity47 was watching all the while ?			0
