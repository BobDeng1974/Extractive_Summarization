by @entity0 with @entity3 breasts and a dress size 18 on top but a 10 below , @entity1 , a 45 - year - old nail technician , was fed up			1
although she 'd already had one successful breast reduction , she decided to have a second operation ahead of her wedding day			1
but thanks to a bungling surgeon , in place of the petite 36c breasts she had hoped for , she woke up to find she had badly scarred square breasts that were pitted with holes and an unwanted triangular protuberance on one side			1
disfigured : @entity1 says she has been left mutilated and miserable by the botched breast reduction ' my breasts were quite large , @entity3 , and i did n't like them because i looked so top heavy and it meant i was size 10 on the bottom and 18 on the top , ' she remembers			1
and after the first operation to reduce them , she was thrilled with the results			0
' within weeks , i was was like a new woman and i could n't believe it , ' she remembers			0
' i had this small bust and there was no pain			0
' but disaster struck when @entity35 began to gain weight and her new , smaller bust regained its old volume			0
' they grew a lot bigger than the rest of me , ' she adds			0
' they grew quite quickly and the back pain was back , the neck pain was back , so i went back to the doctors and the surgeon suggested i have a second breast reduction			1
' with her wedding just three months away , @entity35 was worried that her breasts would n't be healed in time but the surgeon reassured her that things would be fine			2
humiliated : because of her disfigured breasts , @entity1 says she is too embarrassed to go on holiday hidden pain : at her wedding , @entity35 had to resort to wearing a bandage in her bra in order to have a cleavage happier : dawn before having the surgery that has caused her so much pain they were n't and when @entity35 woke up , she was horrified to discover that she 'd been left with square shaped , indented breasts , no cleavage and an unexpected triangular lump on one side			1
' one breast is higher than the other and both are completely square , ' she reveals			1
' on one side , there 's a big triangle bulge - it 's complete disfigurement			2
' determined to look her best on her wedding day , she walked down the aisle with a rolled up bandage in her bra to give herself a cleavage and hid the disfigurement beneath her dress			0
but too embarrassed to wear a bikini , her dream @entity89 honeymoon had to be postponed indefinitely			1
' we 've been married for 12 months and we 've still not been on our honeymoon , ' says @entity1 's husband , @entity94			1
' we were planning to go to @entity89 but have n't been able to go because of the way @entity35 was left			1
she does n't feel comfortable wearing a bikini or any sort of swimwear			2
he added : ' the intimacy side has become very difficult			0
she does n't like me touching her because she 's so self - conscious about it			2
' @entity1 herself says she feels guilty about what happened and the burden it has placed on her relationship with her new husband			1
' @entity94 has had to take on awful lot , ' she adds			0
' it 's not fair on him to be burdened with this as soon as we got married			0
' even though he 's been very patient and very supportive , i 'm not the same person that he met			0
i 've been left so disfigured , i just do n't feel like a woman anymore			2
it really has ruined my life			0
' @entity35 appears on @entity118 : brides , tonight at 10pm on @entity120			0
