by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 15 october 2013 when author @entity2 recalls her nursing days in the @entity4 , she speaks of the ' fun and companionship ' she shared with her colleagues and happy days spent bonding with the community as she carried out her daily duties			1
it seems a far cry from the experiences of nurses today who often work long and stressful hours			2
@entity2 , now 69 and living with her husband in @entity18 , trained as a midwife in @entity20 before qualifying as a @entity22 's nurse in @entity23 , and then worked as a district nurse in the @entity25			1
times have changed : @entity2 says she may well not have chosen to be a nurse if she was starting out on her career today she told @entity29 she loved her job but if she was starting out on her career today , she 's not sure she would have chosen nursing			1
' when i was young , there were n't as many careers for women to chose from , ' she said			0
' i started training to be a nurse when i was 17 but it was very different then to how it is today			2
now it 's much more academic and they have longer working hours , i 'm not sure how girls do it today			0
' the differences seem most striking - for both patients and staff - when comparing how maternity wards operate today compared to in the @entity4			1
@entity2 with her nursing colleague : she said they shared great fun and companionship despite facing some challenging moments through their work @entity2 explains : ' today women have a baby and are often discharged within a day or two			1
before , they would stay in hospital for six days - ten if they 'd had a caesarean			0
it gave the anxious new mothers the chance to develop their confidence with the support of experts			0
' @entity65 is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today ' ' today the maternity wards are more like factories , there is n't time or staff available to support mothers staying for longer			1
' she also believes it 's harder for new mothers to find support from their communities today because everyone leads busy lifestyles and many are n't friendly with their neighbours			1
@entity2 wonders if more mothers would choose home births today if there were more midwives available to help them			1
in the past , as portrayed in the tv show @entity90 , she and her colleagues would cycle to the homes of mothers - to - be to help deliver their babies - with all the equipment they needed in a basket on their bicycles			0
@entity100 's @entity99 : the author has written her own memoirs of her time as a midwife and said she can relate to the show based on the book by @entity106 real deal : @entity2 , far left , lived through the times @entity90 portrays she said : ' we used to cycle everywhere and that did make us feel part of the community and gave us a chance to speak to people			1
sex education was n't as good then though , the children i spoke to used to think we were delivering the babies to the new mothers in our baskets ! ' of the @entity100 show , based on the experiences of midwife @entity106 in the @entity124 , @entity2 said she can ' relate to a lot of it although some scenes have obviously been modified to be more entertaining than reality '			1
home births were commonplace in the @entity124 and one in three newborns were delivered in @entity132 homes in the @entity4			1
by the @entity134 , the majority were on labour wards after the @entity136 recommended that all births should be carried out in hospitals			2
today the number of women booking to have a home birth is rising but the service is limited by some health authorities and only about 2.5 per cent of pregnant women in the @entity132 choose this option			2
@entity2 said : ' anyone who has had a home birth will tell you it 's great but i expect there 's not enough midwives today to provide the service			1
' tellingly , when @entity2 had her own two children , who are now in their thirties , she chose a hospital birth			1
' i suppose it 's because of my job i knew all the worst case scenarios so i wanted to have full medical support , ' she said			0
sharing her memories : now retired from her nursing duties , she has penned three memoirs of her experiences			0
the latest , @entity165 , right , is published this week @entity2 wrote about her midwifery days in her memoirs ' it wo n't hurt a bit ! ' and ' it should n't happen to a midwife ! ' her third memoir , ' @entity172 ' , published this month by @entity174 , recalls her time training to be a district nurse in @entity177			1
she was faced with all manner of challenges , from unwilling patients and life - threatening emergencies , to badly - behaved dogs and runaway chickens , all with the ' back - up ' of the community she served			0
' we were n't dressed for comfort			0
' the uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up ' when it comes to the hospital wards , @entity2 said ' cleanliness was @entity194 ' in the @entity4 and there were less instances of people contracting super bugs like @entity199			1
' @entity65 is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today			0
it 's common sense you ca n't hose them down			0
' i think standards were higher back then			2
if you were seen spending your time talking to a patient you were frogmarched off to clean instead , it was all very military			0
however the more experienced you got the less time you were expected to spend cleaning			0
' @entity2 said the nurses were all referred to by their surnames and their level of experience was denoted by the colour of their belt			1
she concedes that when it comes to uniform , nurses today have a better deal			2
in the @entity4 they had to wear dresses and stockings with pillbox hats			2
' we were n't dressed for comfort , ' she said			0
' the uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up so we could move around better - but we were then told off for our rising hemlines			0
we had to wear starched aprons - a new one every day that had been freshly laundered			0
' in the book , she recalls how the hats worn for nursing lacked style credentials and could n't be worn at a trendy , jaunty angle			2
she writes : ' they only stayed in one position , were the same colour as our coats and defied any sort of creativity , unless you could do a fancy bow with the ties			0
' @entity165 by @entity2 , published by @entity174 , is on sale now for Â£ 9.99 .			2
