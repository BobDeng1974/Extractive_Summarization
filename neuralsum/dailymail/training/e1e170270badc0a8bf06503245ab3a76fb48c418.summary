first minister @entity0 wants to brief @entity2 mandarins on the @entity4 's expensive shopping list should the party hold the balance of power in a hung parliament @entity0 has demanded talks with the @entity10 's top civil servants ahead of the election , sparking claims that @entity13 are ' preparing ' to enter government at @entity15			1
the first minister wants to brief @entity2 mandarins on the @entity4 's expensive shopping list should the party hold the balance of power in a hung parliament			1
it is tradition for civil servants to meet opposition politicians who could form the next government before an election , allowing them to prepare for sudden policy changes			0
miss @entity0 wants to prop up @entity25 in @entity26 , even if @entity27 is the second largest party after the @entity28			1
the most likely scenario would be a confidence - and - supply arrangement rather than a formal left - wing coalition – but that has not been categorically ruled out by either party			0
in return , the first minister would make a series of unrealistic demands – such as scrapping the replacement programme for @entity40 nuclear missiles , a @entity42 veto over an in / out @entity44 referendum , and sweeping new powers for @entity46 that would effectively end the @entity44 that over 2million @entity42 voted to save last year			0
she has also said she also wants an extra £ 180billion to be spent over four years on the @entity10 's credit card , derailing plans to cut @entity10 's deficit			0
miss @entity0 has now written a letter to @entity10 cabinet secretary sir @entity51 to ask for talks – which would have to be sanctioned by prime minister @entity53			1
she outlines some of the @entity4 's post-election demands , although @entity27 pointed out that she fails to mention further powers for @entity46			1
' i am writing with regard to the contact between opposition parties and the civil service prior to general elections , which has become a standard feature of the @entity10 's democratic processes , ' the letter states			0
' these meetings - which as you know require to be sanctioned by the prime minister - enable an opposition party to brief civil servants on its policy agenda , and gain deeper understanding of the systems of policy delivery in @entity2			2
' it adds : ' the @entity4 programme includes a substantial alternative to the austerity cuts supported by the @entity10 @entity15 parties , cancelling the renewal of the @entity40 nuclear weapons system , and a requirement that each and every constituent nation of the @entity10 would have to vote to leave the @entity44 in any in / out referendum before the @entity10 could exit			2
' these and other policies which we will seek to advance in the next parliament are obviously of @entity10 - wide application , and i believe that the @entity2 system would benefit from becoming more familiar with our propositions			0
' miss @entity0 has now written a letter to @entity10 cabinet secretary sir @entity51 ( pictured ) to ask for talks – which would have to be sanctioned by prime minister @entity53 asked if the coalition will give the @entity4 access to the civil service , commons leader @entity95 yesterday told @entity99 on @entity100 : ' that will be up to the cabinet secretary			1
' we are a very democratic county and we do indeed open up to opposition parties			0
we benefited from that before the last election			0
' those decisions are generally up to the senior civil servants and it 's not up to the government in power whether to deny any cooperation or planning to people on the other side of politics so that is up to them			2
' but i think this does illustrate a very important point - the @entity4 are preparing for that and @entity27 will not deny they will enter into a coalition with the @entity4			1
' a @entity27 insider said @entity123 ' will get the brush off from the civil service '			2
' @entity127 politicians ca n't just turn up at talks , ' said the source			0
commons leader @entity95 stressed that any decision to open up the civil service to the @entity4 would be made by the cabinet secretary a @entity27 spokesman added : ' in her letter @entity0 has chosen not to mention her number one priority in the general election – ending the @entity139 formula so @entity42 spending is only supported by @entity42 taxes			1
' @entity139 would cost @entity42 billions so perhaps it is no surprise that he @entity4 have decided to keep quiet about but the people @entity42 deserve to know that @entity4 plans would put public services and pensions at risk			2
' @entity4 deputy leader @entity148 said : ' i think it makes perfect sense for the civil service to look at our manifesto when it 's published so if there is a deal to be done , if there 's discussions to be had , then they can be done on a proper professional technical level in terms of how we might be able to support a minority @entity27 administration			1
' a spokeswoman for the @entity166 said : ' we can confirm that we have received the letter , it is a matter for the prime minister and he will respond in due course			0
