in 2013 he stood before his @entity12 church to beg for someone to adopt him , and now he has a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven - year - old when she became his caseworker			2
my commitment to him is for his whole life , ' said going of @entity5 ( above with @entity24 's daughter @entity30 ) throughout @entity5 's search for a family , and his years in the system , @entity31 , had been by his side - and on wednesday she officially became his mother			1
' this is a special day for a lot of people			0
this room is a testament to all the lives you have touched , ' judge @entity39 told @entity5 in a @entity45 courtroom wednesday according to the @entity46			2
' not just your new mom and siblings , but so many , many people			0
when you were given a bad hand , you did n't accept it			0
you stood up and said , " i 'm worthy			0
i want you to hear me			0
" you 've waited a long time for this day			0
' when asked why she wanted to adopt the teenager , @entity24 put her hand on @entity5 's shoulder and said : ' i 've always loved him , the same as my other children			1
my commitment to him is for his whole life			0
' a number of people were said to be in tears in the courtroom			0
before coming to his decision the judge had asked @entity24 's daughters if they agreed to the adoption , to which her eldest , 17 - year - old @entity30 , replied ' it feels right '			2
going said of @entity5 ; ' when it was @entity5 's turn to speak he remained silent , but did say at the end of the process ; ' thank you all for being my family			1
' firm family bond : @entity5 , 16 , who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to ' love him forever ' @entity5 plays on the @entity79 in his bedroom with his mom @entity24 sitting behind him together with her daughter @entity30 , 17 , and her adopted son , @entity83 , 14 going has admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family , but she said it was worth it			1
since august , @entity5 has been spending weekends with @entity24 and her daughters , @entity90 , 21 , @entity91 , 17 , and with her adopted son @entity83 , who is now 14			1
then in december , going took the steps to begin the adoption process and @entity5 moved with the rest of the family into a larger home			1
since then there have fights and tables have been flipped , but in the end everyone loves one another , and she is prepared for the challenges			0
' i 'm okay with messy and difficult , ' she told the @entity46			0
' you just have to have your armor on all the time , but it 's more than worth it			2
and every day things get a little bit better			0
' @entity5 became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church : ' my name is @entity5 and i 've been in foster care since i was born			1
i know @entity120 has n't given up on me , so i 'm not giving up either			0
' he then said : ' i 'll take anyone			0
old or young , dad or mom , black , white , purple			0
and i would be really appreciative			0
the best i could be			0
' @entity5 only , 16 , has been adopted by his old case worker , @entity31 going in @entity12 ( above )			1
she has known the teen since he was seven years old			0
@entity5 had been in the foster care system his entire life @entity5 ( above ) captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a @entity135 church congregation for a family to ' love him forever ' most of all , @entity5 said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever '			1
millions of people around the country soon heard about @entity5 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by @entity143 on @entity144 , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in @entity146 and his family			1
that is until @entity5 got into a fight with one of the other children , and the minister sent him back to @entity12 , and back to live in the foster care system			2
after @entity5 returned , people kept asking going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months			2
' that boy spent his whole life in the system , that 's what went wrong , ' she said			2
making matters worse , @entity5 and miss @entity24 , as he calls her , did not speak when he came back to @entity12			2
@entity5 had cut himself off from other people , playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year			2
@entity5 only ( pictured above with @entity24 going at the church where he made his speech in 2013 ) was adopted by a minister in @entity146 but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister 's children going says she had begun to call him numerous times , but he always hung up the phone			1
then , one night last july , @entity5 called up miss @entity24 and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy			1
' do you remember what i asked you before ? ' he said			0
' well , how do you feel about adopting me now ? ' for the first time since he had asked , going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear			0
the 52 - year - old case worker has three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer @entity5 's case worker , which made the process easier			1
from august through december he started spending more and more time with the family , a perfect fit as he was already close to going 's adopted son @entity83			1
then , in december , going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting @entity5			1
@entity5 only ( pictured above in church three years ago ) called and asked miss @entity24 if she would adopt him last july @entity5 got his first bedroom , his first set of siblings , and , most importantly , the one thing he had been hoping for all along			0
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity5 said to going last december			1
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' @entity5 officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers			1
after 16 years @entity5 was finally home			0
what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when @entity5 stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well			1
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity5 ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december			1

@entity5 only *won* @entity221 hearts in 2013 with plea for family to ' love him forever '
*yesterday* he was officially adopted by old caseworker @entity31 going
he 's lived with her two daughters and adopted boy since december
ms going admitted it has not always been easy but says it is worth it and ' everyday it gets a little bit better '
