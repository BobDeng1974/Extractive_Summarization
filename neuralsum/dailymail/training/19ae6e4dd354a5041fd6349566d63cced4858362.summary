by @entity0 published : 12:58 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 29 october 2013 a nine - week - old baby has become @entity3 's youngest ever beauty queen			1
@entity5 's mother @entity4 , 27 , entered her into the @entity7 @entity3 contest before she was even born			1
mother - of - three @entity4 , from @entity8 , was seven months pregnant - and knew she was carrying a girl - when she sat down to register her unborn baby into the competition			1
@entity5 has become @entity3 's youngest ever beauty queen despite being just nine weeks old @entity5 was born by caesarean on july 23 weighing 7lb 7oz and just 68 days later her doting mother dressed her up and carried her down the catwalk to be judged			1
@entity4 wanted @entity5 to follow in the footsteps of sister @entity16 , seven , who takes to the stage kitted out with make - up , wash - off fake tan and press - on nails			1
former child minder @entity4 , who paid £ 10 to enter @entity5 , said : ' i did n't put any make - up on @entity5 because she is too young for that , so she was natural			1
' she wore a really pretty pink dress and head band , she even smiled for the judges			2
' she did n't have to do a talent or show confidence because she ca n't walk or talk so i think it was judged on cuteness			2
' i do n't know if @entity5 wants to do pageants but i do n't think it will damage her			1
@entity35 registered @entity5 into the @entity7 @entity3 contest after discovering she was having a girl ' she does n't know what she 's doing so it wo n't affect her at that age			1
' if she tells me when she is older she does n't want to do that 's fine and that 's her choice			2
' pint - sized @entity5 was crowned with her first sash and tiara			1
despite coming under fire from fellow parents , @entity4 and mechanic husband @entity45 , 29 , will continue to chaperone their daughters to pageants across the country			1
they have already been to 10 different contests and spent more than £ 2,000 pounds on dresses , shoes , travel , hotels and accessories in the past three years on @entity16			0
@entity4 , who also has a son @entity58 , six , added : ' three years ago @entity16 watched @entity59 on @entity60 and said she wanted to do something like that			1
' i did n't know anything about pageants so researched it a bit			0
' i entered a contest by sending a photo of @entity16 to the organiser out of curiosity			2
@entity4 wanted @entity5 to follow in the footsteps of sister @entity16 , seven , who already competes ' we did n't hear anything for ages but then one day we got a phone call offered her a place			1
' that was the start of our pageant life			0
' @entity16 did n't win but she really enjoyed it and said she wanted to do more			0
' when she was a toddler she used to play with mud and dirt but as she got older she became more girly - you wo n't find her in a tracksuit now			0
' i remember going to parents evening afterwards and the teacher said she could n't believe the difference in confidence in her			0
' i told her about the pageant and i can only presume that had made her change from being such a shy reserved girl			0
seven - year - old @entity16 has enjoyed taking part in pageants since watching @entity59 ' i hope @entity5 will gain as much confidence as @entity16 through pageants			2
' @entity96 , miss @entity7 organiser , said : ' because beauty pageants are a family event and the whole family like to be involved we decided to introduce just one round for newborns this year			0
' parents dressed their babies up in little dresses or suits			0
' it was judged on cute factor and @entity5 won			2
we thought she looked adorable in a little pink dress and head band			0
