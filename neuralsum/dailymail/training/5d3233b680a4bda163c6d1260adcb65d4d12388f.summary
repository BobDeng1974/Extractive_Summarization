by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 11 march 2013 it was a symbol of @entity3 supremacy that became a prison cell for 52 @entity3			1
now the hallways of the @entity3 embassy in @entity7 , abandoned after it was stormed by a screaming mob during the 1979 hostage crisis , echo to nothing but the sound of soldiers ' training boots			1
the rooms where secret state missions were planned have been covered in graffiti and pictures of @entity20 revolutionaries have been casually propped against typewriters left behind by embassy workers			0
but apart from the most minor of cosmetic changes , the building that caused a global diplomatic crisis is frozen in time - and looks almost identical to its portrayal in the @entity29 - winning @entity28 movie @entity30			1
painted on the walls are anti-american murals pictures and equipment of @entity3 are seen inside the former embassy which hit the headlines in late 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of @entity3 staff hostage the embassy garnered worldwide attention in november 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of @entity3 staff hostage			1
thousands of other protesters pressed around the compound , responding to a call by the country 's new leader , @entity51 , to attack @entity3 and @entity54 interests			1
of the 90 people in the compound , six @entity3 managed to escape the building and flee to other embassies			1
it was those six that inspired the film @entity30 directed by and starring @entity28 which spins the account of a joint @entity65 - @entity64 mission to spring the @entity3 from revolutionary @entity20 , using a fake movie production as a decoy			1
other @entity69 citizens captured when the embassy was seized were released			0
but 66 were captured , including three seized at the @entity71 , and held hostage for 444 days			1
the students paraded the blindfolded hostages for the cameras to humiliate the ‘ @entity76 ’ that @entity77 had become in the eyes of the @entity20 revolutionary leaders			1
they demanded that the @entity80 be expelled from the @entity3 , where he had been taken for cancer treatment after he was overthrown			2

the @entity3 broke off diplomatic relations with @entity20 on april 7 , 1980 after a group of @entity20 students captured some 60 @entity3 diplomats the building is now occupied by the @entity91 and houses a museum that is only open a few days a year an @entity20 staff member stands inside the former @entity3 embassy			1
the walls of are filled with murals and slogans depicting the evil of @entity3 and its allies , particularly @entity54 it was a shocking and demoralising sight for the @entity3 public - the beginning of a long standoff between the @entity3 and militant @entity104 that has lasted until today			1
freeing the hostages became a priority for the administration of @entity3 president @entity108 - but nothing could be done apart from enforcing ineffective economic sanctions			1
mr @entity108 pledged to preserve the lives of the hostages and conducted intense diplomacy to secure their release			0
but his failure ultimately contributed to his losing the presidency to @entity118 in 1980			0
two weeks into the crisis , @entity51 ordered the release of 13 female and black hostages , mostly clerical staff and members of the marine guard who guard @entity3 embassies around the world			1
another hostage , vice consul @entity128 , was released in july 1980 after falling ill with multiple sclerosis			0
but the remaining 52 were deprived of their freedom for 444 days			1
in february 1980 @entity20 issued a new set of demands for the hostages ' freedom			0
it called for the @entity137 to be handed over to face trial in @entity7 , as well as other diplomatic gestures , such as a @entity3 apology for its actions			2
protest : @entity20 students burn the @entity143 outside the the @entity144 in @entity7 hostages : @entity3 embassy staff were blindfolded and taken hostage when militants stormed the embassy compound in @entity7 in november 1979 president @entity108 rejected the demands , but was about to make the crisis considerably worse with an ill - conceived rescue mission			1
a daring @entity3 military rescue operation codenamed @entity155 ended in further @entity3 humiliation in april 1980			2
the plan was to land aircraft covertly in the desert allowing special forces to infiltrate @entity7 and free the 52 hostages			2
but the planning was flawed , and the mission had to be aborted when two helicopters were damaged in a sandstorm and failed to reach the meeting point			0
worse was to come when another crashed into a transport plane as it was pulling out			0
eight @entity3 personnel lost their lives			2
some of their bodies were taken through the streets of @entity7 during massive protests			0
secret operational documents were also discovered in the wreckage and put on display for the international media			0
dramatic : @entity20 students climb over the wall of the @entity3 embassy in @entity7 just before the hostage crisis , in which 52 @entity3 were held hostages for 444 days in 1979 inside and armed : taken by an @entity20 student , this picture shows a kidnapper inside the @entity3 embassy at the very beginning of the hostage crisis fear : @entity3 hostages sit in a corridor , blindfolded so they can not see the faces of their kidnappers ' down with imperialism ' : press conference inside the @entity3 embassy held by the @entity20 student kidnappers			1

it called for the @entity137 to be handed over to face trial in @entity7 , as well as other diplomatic gestures , such as a @entity3 apology for its actions trouble to come : kidnappers hold discussions			2
president @entity108 rejected the demands , but was about to make the crisis considerably worse with an ill - conceived rescue mission and to avert any other rescue efforts , the student hostage - takers at the embassy split up their captives and spread them around @entity20			2
after months of negotiations , helped by @entity222 intermediaries and the @entity137 's death , @entity3 diplomacy bore fruit			0
on the day of president @entity118 's inauguration , 20 january 1981 , the hostages were set free			0
a day later they arrived at a @entity3 air force base in @entity228			0
in return the @entity3 had agreed to unfreeze @entity20 assets worth us $ 8billion and give hostage takers immunity			2
today , the embassy is still the stage for angry anniversary demonstrations in which protesters chant anti-us and @entity54 slogans and burn flags and effigies			1
designed in 1948 by the architect @entity240 , it is a long , low two - storey brick building , and bears a resemblance to @entity3 high schools built in the 1930s and 1940s			1
for this reason , the building was nicknamed ' @entity246 ' by the embassy staff , referring to @entity248 , who became @entity3 's ambassador to @entity20 just after construction was completed in 1951 showing off : one of the hostages , blindfolded and with his hands bound , is displayed to crowds outside the @entity144 in 1979			1
on the day of president @entity118 's inauguration , 20 january 1981 , the hostages were set free			0
a day later they arrived at a @entity3 air force base in @entity228 early demonstrations : even today , the embassy is still the stage for angry anniversary demonstrations in which protesters chant anti-us and @entity54 slogans and burn flags and effigies now the 15 - feet walls of the compound are filled with murals and slogans depicting the evil of @entity3 and its allies , particularly @entity54			1
one illustration has a satanic skull instead of the @entity275 's face			0
another shows a black hand wearing the flags of the @entity3 and @entity54 as wristbands and clutching a globe in its talons ; the inscription , from the @entity283 's founder , @entity51 , reads , ‘ the @entity3 is regarded as the most hated government in the world			1
’ the former @entity286 declares in other panels that the @entity3 is ‘ too weak to do anything ’ and refers to the @entity3 government as a ‘ dictatorship			0
’ in case the message has not gotten through , visitors who exit the nearby subway station are immediately faced with a hard - to - miss sign : ‘ death to @entity3			2
’ outside the door , meanwhile , stands a bronze model based on @entity300 's @entity275 on the left - hand side			0
while tourists do stop and stare inside , the place is not open for sightseeing and the @entity20 government uses the compound to train members of the @entity91			0
crisis : @entity28 , in his role as a @entity64 agent , talks to the hostages that escaped from the @entity3 embassy starring role : @entity28 starred as a @entity64 agent in the film @entity30 , about the crisis which won the @entity29 for @entity319 at this year 's @entity29 soldiers with @entity321 patrol the brick wall from guard posts poised above the metal fences or elevated walkways , and closed - circuit television cameras monitor the perimeter			1
the old embassy , maintained by the @entity91 , is still very indicative of the official @entity330 stance of the government			0
but today that policy is increasingly in conflict with popular attitudes			0
evidence of an appetite for western consumer goods can be seen along the capitals shopping boulevard where among the shops are @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343			0
and , many @entity20 see immigration to the @entity3 and @entity345 as a way to escape the repressive regime .			2

it was site of worst hostage crisis in @entity3 history when revolutionary students stormed in and took 52 staff hostage
of 90 people inside , six managed to escape and flee to other embassies , as dramatised in @entity29 - winning film @entity30
the captured hostages were paraded around in front of cameras and kept in captivity for 444 days
today , the building is still the stage for demonstrations and the walls are covered with anti-us and @entity54 murals
