there is something romantic about one of the supreme footballers of all time passing away just as his country of birth comes to the climax of its bid to win the @entity9			0
vamos , vamos @entity11 – in memory of @entity13			2
there is a consoling grace about @entity16 taking his leave of we mere mortals having just celebrated his 88th birthday in his usual affectionate company of family and friends			0
historic : @entity16 celebrating after @entity25 beat @entity59 4 - 3 to lift the first ever @entity33 in 1956 throwback : @entity16 during a game in august 1963 against @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 free : @entity16 talking to the media at the @entity67 embassy in @entity63 in 1963 after being released from his kidnappers @entity70 great @entity69 dies ages 88 this gentleman lived his 88 years to the full			1
there is a sense of history about the ultimate @entity76 bidding us farewell even as the @entity80 successor to his throne in @entity82 is striving to join him among the top five players ever			2
arise to the occasion , @entity88 , destiny beckons in @entity89 these coming days			0
there is something uncanny , from our peculiarly @entity93 perspective , about @entity95 taking his final bow just as the @entity99 season is about to open at the @entity100			2
because @entity16 ’s unique mastery of the game in all its facets may best be described as him being , not only the virtuoso , but also the composer and conductor of every football orchestra in which he played			0
to watch him was to be enchanted by the creative magic he wove in midfield , to marvel at his reading and control of the game , to be astonished by his genius for scoring goals			0
to see him for the first time – as did a multitude of privileged @entity115 among the 127,621 crowd at @entity117 and my generation of @entity120 on black - and - white television – was to be awoken to football so alien that it might have come not from @entity25 but from @entity124			1
that occasion , on a balmy @entity125 evening in may 1960 , celebrated the fifth of the consecutive triumphs with which @entity25 launched the @entity33 into orbit			1
100 : @entity130 leads out a @entity132 side against @entity133 for the @entity135 @entity134 in 1963			0
captaining @entity133 was @entity137 , with @entity138 just behind him meet and greet : @entity16 meets @entity140 manager sir @entity139 ( centre ) and his assistant @entity142 ( left ) at @entity143 greats : sir @entity145 , then manager of @entity146 , greets @entity16 , then coach of @entity25 , ahead of the @entity148 final in 1983 contrast : @entity16 sits alongside striking @entity151 keeper @entity150 on the bench double trouble : @entity16 congratulates his fellow countrymen @entity155 after he received the ' @entity157 ' award for lifetime achievement in @entity159 on jan 3 , 1995 it remains , in our memory as living witnesses , the most wondrous of all the finals in this competition , by whatever name it is known			1
@entity16 had scored in the four preceding finals			0
there was never a doubt he would do so again on this night and more than half a century later he is still the only man to score on five of these occasions			0
just to make sure , he ran up a hat - trick			0
his illustrious left - hand man @entity39 went one better as they claimed all @entity25 ’s goals between them in a 7 - 3 victory which also starred @entity40 and @entity177 what made it all the more impressive was that @entity180 were typically formidable @entity182 opponents , who actually took the lead before the avalanche			1
for many of us , football changed that night			0
to see @entity16 in person , as i was fortunate to do on a trip to @entity25 not long before he departed @entity25 in 1964 , was to pay homage to the master			2
by then @entity193 had gone a mighty long way towards scoring a phenomenal 485 goals in 664 club appearancs for @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity11 , @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity25 and finally @entity201 in @entity82			1
in addition to those five @entity203 , he racked up a host of league and cup - winners ’ medals in all three of those countries and had twice been elected @entity157			0
winners : @entity16 talks with then @entity25 player @entity210 holding his @entity157 trophy in 2001 @entity9 winners : @entity16 holds the @entity33 trophy in april 2003 alongside sir @entity214 ( left ) and @entity215 influential : @entity16 was still a key part of the @entity25 backroom into his later years , helping secure the signings of the likes of @entity220 in 2003 @entity221 : @entity16 poses with @entity25 captain @entity222 and a whole load of trophies in 2006 embrace : @entity16 and @entity225 before a friendly game in 1956 against @entity59 , 50 years after the first @entity57 secured : @entity16 and @entity25 president @entity227 ( right ) presenting new signing @entity228 in 2006 510 official matches played by @entity16 for five clubs : @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity11 , @entity199 in @entity200 and @entity25 and @entity201 in @entity82			1
418 goals scored in his club career			0
@entity16 played for @entity200 and @entity11 early in his career before later moving to , and playing for , @entity82			1
22 club trophies won as a player , including eight league titles and five consecutive @entity240 cups with @entity25 between 1956 and 1960			1
5 @entity16 scored in all five of those @entity33 finals with @entity25 , including a hat - trick in the last one against @entity56 in @entity244 teams managed , including @entity245 , @entity25 and fierce @entity80 rivals @entity247 and @entity197			1
6 trophies won as a manager , including a league and cup double with @entity247			0
he won five runners - up medals with @entity25 but managed just one title with @entity25 - the @entity255 so desperately sought after was @entity16 in @entity82 that his transfer from @entity199 in 1953 was a matter of huge controversy			1
he had signed a first option to @entity260 but when their president questioned his value and hesitated , @entity25 stepped in			2
issues remained with @entity197 , who retained his registration in @entity11			2
@entity266 washed their hands of the mess and with the @entity67 @entity135 split on @entity272 party lines there was much speculation that @entity274 , @entity82 ’s dictator , applied pressure for them to approve di @entity16 ’s signing for @entity25 , of whom he was an avid supporter			1
it is more certain that @entity274 rubber - stamped second citizenship for the @entity282 - born @entity281 so he could play for @entity82			1
@entity266 had not recognised his four appearances for @entity200 , while with @entity199 , but they refused initially to approve the @entity67 request because he had played half a dozen times for @entity11			1
they relented , following diplomatic entreaties from @entity25			2
that complicated @entity16 ’s international career			0
a combination of injuries and failures by @entity11 and @entity82 to qualify deprived him of participation in the @entity9 finals			2
that was football ’s loss , also			0
even so , he scored 29 goals in his 37 official appearances for @entity11 and @entity82			1

however , he was cursed to come second in five competitions in one season with @entity25 , including the 1983 @entity329 ’ @entity57 defeat by @entity146 which , not least because of @entity16 ’s illustrious presence in the opposite dug - out , sir @entity331 counts as one of his greatest successes			1
that did not stop real loving him			0
the feeling was mutual as he and @entity40 expressed to a few of us , @entity138 included , on one long , warm evening @entity339 in the 90s			0
it was an education to listen to him reflecting nostalgically on the attacking spirit which had been at the founding heart of the greatest of all club teams			0
@entity25 made him their honorary president			2
they gave him a permanent , rent - free home in a most pleasant apartment close by the @entity26 , near which he was walking when the suffered his second , and this time fatal , heart attack			0
always forever : @entity16 was associated with @entity25 right up until the end , posing in 2013 with new signing @entity351 crossing borders : @entity16 represented both @entity11 and @entity82 during his illustrious career thank you @entity356 : real president @entity357 paying tribute to the legend following his passing on july 7 , 2014 the @entity24 , as he was known , has flown			1
he leaves to @entity362 ’s tribute : ‘ the most complete footballer in the history of the game			0
