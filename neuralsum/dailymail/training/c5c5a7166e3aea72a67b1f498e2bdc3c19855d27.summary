he said the @entity22 actor 's on - and - off political aspirations were ' on one level [ ... ] very real '			1
he said : ' i think he 's very committed and extremely bright and knowledgeable and i think he could do it and he could run			1
' on the other hand , i 'm not quite sure if he 's cut from the proper cloth because it requires a lot of tolerance and a lot of patience			1
' @entity18 noted that the 54 - year - old , who told @entity34 this week how he fantasised about murdering his ex-wife @entity36 's lawyer during their bitter child custody battle , had a reputation for being ' temperamental ' and ' a bit hot - headed '			1

i really , really do			2
and i do n’t know if i will			2
if i want to run , run for what ? you have to stop and ask a lot of whys			2
run for the glory ? ' run to complete some missing piece of myself ? i can keep doing what i ’m doing for a living now and be perfectly happy			2
' but in the same interview he also said he wanted @entity83 , creator of the hugely successful website @entity85 , to die a violent death			2
his ' revenge ' was for @entity83 posting a voicemail recording where he called his then 11 - year - old daughter @entity90 a ' rude thoughtless little pig			2
