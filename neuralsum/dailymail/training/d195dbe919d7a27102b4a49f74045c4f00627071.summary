' we got the whole team , the whole club back together			1
' this win can have a really galvanising effect , definitely			1

' @entity82 returned as a late substitute after a thigh problem but @entity84 insisted his skipper is not guaranteed a place after the form of @entity99 and @entity100			0
he said : ' the really pleasing thing is that @entity99 had 14 months out and is coming in like this , and @entity100 looks outstanding			0
