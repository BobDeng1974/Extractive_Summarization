it is a mystery that has gone unsolved for more than 140 years since @entity1 noticed something peculiar about domesticated mammals			1
but now scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness , such as floppier ears , patches of white fur , and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws			1
geneticists believe that a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest , link all these traits , which are seen in many people ’s pet cats and dogs			1
domestic science : scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness , such as floppier ears , patches of white fur , and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws ( illustrated by this spaniel ) - and it 's because of a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest although the experts ' proposal has not yet been tested , it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ‘ domestication syndrome			1
’ it not only applies to mammals like dogs , foxes , pigs , horses , sheep and rabbits , but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish , according to the study published in the journal @entity48			0
‘ because @entity1 made his observations just as the science of genetics was beginning , the domestication syndrome is one of the oldest problems in the field			2
so it was tremendously exciting when we realised that the neural crest hypothesis neatly ties together this hodgepodge of traits , ’ said @entity49 , from the @entity50 , who is one of the paper ’s authors			1
neural crest cells are formed near the developing spinal cord of early vertebrate embryos			0
as the embryo matures , the cells migrate to different parts of the body and give rise to many tissue types			0
@entity1 ( pictured left ) noticed tame mammals share certain characteristics and scientists have struggled to understand why they share certain characteristics ever since			1
wild dogs and wolves , ( pictured right ) which evolved from a common ancestor of the modern dog , tend to have large jaws and erect ears these tissues include pigment cells and parts of the skull , jaws , teeth and ears , as well as the adrenal glands , which are the centre of the ‘ fight - or - flight ’ response			1
neural crest cells also indirectly affect brain development			0
in the hypothesis proposed by @entity100 and scientists at @entity102 and the @entity103 , domesticated mammals may show impaired development or migration of neural crest cells compared to their wild ancestors			1
‘ when humans bred these animals for tameness , they may have inadvertently selected those with mild neural crest deficits , resulting in smaller or slow - maturing adrenal glands			1
so , these animals were less fearful , ’ he explained			0
although the experts ' proposal has not yet been tested , it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ' domestication syndrome '			2

scientists now think that these cells link traits seen in domesticated animals , such as floppier ears , patches of white fur and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws			1
the neural crest influences more than adrenal glands			2
among other effects , neural crest deficits can cause white patches of skin and fur , floppy ears , tooth anomalies , and jaw development changes , all of which are seen in the domestication syndrome			1
the authors also suggest that the reduced forebrain size of most domestic mammals could be an indirect effect of neural crest changes , because a chemical signal sent by these cells is critical for proper brain development			2
‘ this interesting idea based in developmental biology brings us closer to solving a riddle that 's been with us a long time			0
it provides a unifying hypothesis to test and brings valuable insight into the biology of domestication , ’ said @entity183 , editor - in - chief of the journal			0
tests of the neural crest hypothesis may not be far off , as other scientists are rapidly mapping the genes that have been altered by domestication in the rat , fox , and dog			2
the hypothesis predicts that some of these genes will influence neural crest cell biology			0
if so , experts will have a much deeper understanding of the biology underlying a significant evolutionary event , dr @entity49 explained			0
‘ animal domestication was a crucial step in the development of human civilisations			0
without these animals , it 's hard to imagine that human societies would have thrived in the way they have , ’ he added .			0

a study led by @entity50 claims that a a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest , link traits in tame animals
@entity1 first noted that domesticated mammals share a strange *mixture* of characteristics such as floppier ears and white patches of fur
the modern scientists ' hypothesis has *n't* been tested , but is the first to connect several components of the ‘ domestication syndrome ’
they think that humans inadvertently selected animals to breed that had mild neural crest deficits , resulting in smaller adrenal glands
