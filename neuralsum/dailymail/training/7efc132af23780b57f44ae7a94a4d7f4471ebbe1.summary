unlike the @entity64 , the main olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous @entity18 football stadium , the @entity67 , which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the @entity72 - home to the club side @entity73			1

visionary : @entity81 , 51 , who headed up @entity83 's bid to win the design contract , looks over the plan			0
building work underway with the project said to be more straightforward than @entity15 because several venues are already on the site due to its former role in hosting the @entity79 flowing design : cutting through the centre of the park is the @entity93 which reflects the design of pavements across @entity18 which show the merging of the darker waters of the @entity98 and the lighter waters of the @entity100 in the @entity101 big project : mr @entity81 looks over his designs			1
unlike the @entity64 , the main olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous @entity18 football stadium , the @entity67 , which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the @entity72 - home to the club side @entity73 @entity83 , based in @entity112 , @entity15 , were also responsible for designing @entity15 's much - heralded olympic park in @entity114			1
@entity81 , 51 , who led @entity83 's @entity5 bid to win the contract said : ' it is very exciting			0
it will show off the best of @entity18 architecture in a magnificent setting			1
' this is the first @entity123 in @entity124 and @entity5 is the most beautiful city in the world and we have tried to reflect the beauty and spirit of the place in our masterplan			0
' explaining how it will differ from the @entity15 park , @entity81 added : ' @entity15 was very complex because of the old industry and network of canals			2
@entity5 is more straightforward in that it is flat and already partially developed			0
' but our approach has been very similar , especially with regards to leaving a legacy and in using @entity18 architects in the same way all smiles : @entity81 stands over the model			1
venues such as the velodrome and aquatics centre are already at the site , requiring only minor conversions to bring them up to standard to host the @entity79			2
and unlike @entity15 , the park will also host the @entity23 tennis @entity154 architects were used in @entity15			1
that is something that was key in @entity15 and @entity157 ( @entity158 , the mayor of @entity5 ) was keen to do the same			0
' we are already talking about some interesting ideas of converting some of the temporary venues into public buildings , like schools after the games			0
' @entity81 said one of the main challenges facing @entity5 was public transport			2
the city of six million people has just two metro lines			0
' the authorities are working on the transport and are extending the lines out to the park			2
the good thing for us , is a lot of the upgrades will be done in time for the @entity181 in 2014 , ' he said			0
venues such as the velodrome and aquatics centre are already at the site , requiring only minor conversions to bring them up to standard to host the @entity79			2
