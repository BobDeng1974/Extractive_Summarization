by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 06:36 est , 29 august 2012 @entity2 moggie : @entity3 says her cat @entity5 can be moody but is generally very docile and sweet - natured with humans meet @entity3 the owner of the ' @entity10 lion ' who this week revealed her less - than ferocious feline is actually just a pussycat			1
her three - year - old cat @entity5 sparked @entity14 's biggest safari hunt earlier this week when terrified holidaymakers thought they 'd seen a lion - but it was in fact @entity5 on an evening stroll through a stubble field			1
today , former fitness instructor mrs @entity3 said her 3ft long @entity21 is n't like a lion at all - just very docile and loves nothing more being doted on			1
she said : ' he 's the boss of the dog but he 's quite docile and sweet - natured with humans			1
' mrs @entity3 was away in @entity27 when the story about the ' @entity10 lion ' broke on sunday evening			1
the 50 - year - old watch the drama unfold on television - but as she watched the police cars racing to the scene near her home in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity10 , she had a sneaking feeling that her very own ' big cat ' was behind the saga			1
mrs @entity3 said @entity5 's five minutes of fame had n't gone to his head - although he has been happily posing for photos			1
she said : ' he 's been sleeping and he 's been very tired but he 's out at the moment			2
' he was superb with the film crew yesterday and he loved having his photo taken			2
he absolutely loved all the attention , but it 's not gone to his head			2
' when mrs @entity3 bought her cat three years ago she hoped he 'd stay indoors and keep her company after she was diagnosed with liver cancer			1
but she was in for a shock as @entity5 discovered a passion for the outdoors - possibly triggered by mrs @entity3 's dog @entity54 who she says relentlessly insists on playing with him			1
roaming round gardens and paths near her home she soon realised he loved nothing more than stalking for prey and took a shine to one particular field			1
she said : ' he likes that field , it 's his field , and he goes hunting for hares all the time			2
' sometimes he disappears for two or three days , but he always comes back , but he spends a lot of time out			0
he 's a bit of a sulky cat because the dog gets all the attention			1
sometimes he does get in a strop			0
' she added : ' he 's only lion - like with the dog , he hisses at him and the dog irritates him immensely as he always wants to play with him			2
' on the prowl : @entity5 stalks through a stubble field yesterday just days after he was mistaken for the @entity10 lion mrs @entity3 said she knew straight away @entity5 was responsible for the safari hunt when she saw the blurry photo of the ' lion ' taken by witnesses			1
the @entity21 , also known as @entity21 , is one of the oldest natural breeds in @entity86			0
they are renowned for their size and are known as the ' gentle giants ' of the feline world , and have a rectangular body shape and a long flowing coat			0
they can weigh up to 25lbs and are not considered fully grown until they are four or five years old			0
they have a beard around their necks which can look like a lion 's mane and long hair around their legs and chest			2
unusually for cats they also enjoy playing with water			0
she said he 's been mistaken for a fox before , adding : ‘ all my friends were joking that it must be @entity5			1
when i saw the photo i recognised him straight away			0
the way his ears were and his head			0
’ armed officers and two police helicopters using heat - seeking equipment , which cost £ 880 an hour to run , were scrambled in a bid to track down the wild animal following sunday 's reports			0
workers from nearby @entity125 carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors			0
caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre			0
mrs @entity3 , married to engineer @entity131 , 51 , said she realises now how @entity5 , with his ginger mane , could have been mistaken for a lion			1
she said : ' i 've just looked across the field now and i can see a white cat and it looks huge			1
it 's a question of perspective			0
' the mother - of - three added : ‘ we thought it had to be @entity144 as he ’s the only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to wander into that field			2
’ ' as we were away he probably went into the field to sulk			1
here , kitty kitty : mrs @entity3 , who is battling liver cancer , says this is definitely her cat @entity5 and she knew it was him as soon as she saw the picture			1
she said from a distance he can look quite big pet lover : @entity3 cuddles up to her giant ginger moggie @entity5			1
she was away in @entity27 when her cat sparked @entity14 's biggest safari hunt after holidaymakers though they 'd seen a lion in @entity36 , @entity10 ‘ from a distance , because he has a light coloured mane he does look a little lion like			1
i can see why someone would think that			0
' @entity5 is a @entity21 which is the biggest breed of domestic cat and can grow up to 25lbs			1
mrs @entity3 is waiting for an important update on her cancer this week and might have to raise £ 50,000 for a new treatment called immunotheraphy which is available in @entity172 and could help fight her disease			0
roar ! the feline likes to boss dogs around but is very sweet - natured with humans and enjoys hunting hares she said : ‘ i got him because i wanted some comfort and he has been brilliant			2
what ’s happened has really cheered me up , it is quite amusing			0
' despite mrs @entity3 ’s certainty as to the culprit in @entity186 , however , there remain several witnesses who remain equally convinced that the creature they saw was much more than just a little kitty			0
first to spot the animal was @entity191 , 52 , a warehouse worker from @entity192 , on holiday at @entity194 with her husband @entity195			0
big cat ? @entity5 is so large and ginger that he 's been mistaken for a fox before - but never a lion playtime : @entity5 is a three ft long @entity21 - the largest domestic cat - and mrs @entity3 said she can understand why people might think he was a lion from a distance			1
she said she enjoys playing in this field ‘ there was some smoke from a bonfire , but it cleared i could see this shape in the field , so i got the binoculars out , ’ she said yesterday			2
‘ i said to my husband , “ what do you make of that ? ” he said , “ that ’s a lion			2
” we were n’t scared at all – it was excitement			0
‘ you do n’t often see something like that in the wild			0
at one point time it sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching			0
it knew we were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself			0
’ searching : police were seen patrolling areas around @entity194 in @entity35 ( pictured ) , near @entity36 , @entity10			0

former fitness instructor @entity233 says her pet cat @entity5 is ' very sweet nature and docile '
she said he can sometimes be a bit moody and probably wandered into the field to ' sulk ' when he was mistaken for a lion
