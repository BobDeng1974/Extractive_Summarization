proposals for an @entity2 card have been sent to health secretary @entity3 @entity5 could have to carry an ‘ entitlement card ’ to access free @entity2 care as part of a crackdown on health tourists , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity11 is considering plans to restrict free healthcare for immigrants to those who have lived here for more than a year , amid fears the cash - strapped @entity2 has become the ‘ @entity18 ’			1
reforms under discussion could mean immigrants having to wait six months or even a year before being granted habitual residency and therefore hospital care			1
but mps say the scheme can only work if those entitled to free care can prove it			1
this would involve them presenting a card at the point of treatment			2
however , the idea could spark civil liberty concerns akin to the opposition to @entity36 ’s plans to impose an identity card			2
and any plans to change the habitual residency test could be controversial			0
the @entity40 is already unhappy that the @entity5 has imposed such a test to prevent immigrants gaining access to all benefits and would be likely to oppose a plan to extend the test to entitlement to @entity2 care			1
@entity49 , @entity36 mp for @entity51 , and @entity52 , @entity53 mp for @entity54 , who co-chairman a cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration , have written a letter to @entity3 to outline their proposal			0
they told the health secretary to ‘ get this situation dealt with very soon ’ to avoid a public backlash			0
the idea would be welcomed by many doctors who say they find it difficult to ask people whether they are entitled to @entity2 care for fear of appearing racist			1
conservative plans to clamp down on immigrants ’ access to free healthcare will be seen as an another attempt by the party to steal a march on @entity79 after their second place in last week ’s @entity82			1
@entity79 leader @entity83 claimed they pushed the @entity85 into third because @entity11 was too busy talking about issues such as wind turbines and gay marriage rather than immigration			0
ill - fated : @entity36 's id card plan failed mr @entity11 has confirmed previous reports that he is backing plans to clamp down on immigrants ’ access to free healthcare			2
he wants to do this by changing the ‘ habitual residency test ’ , which is used to refuse certain benefits to immigrants			0
at present , it gives full access to @entity2 care to anyone permanently resident in the @entity5			1
@entity103 , @entity102 , would like to see a habitual residence test for all handouts in addition , hospitals will be compelled to enforce current rules which mean tourists and others who have no right to free care – including failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants – are charged for any services they receive on the @entity2			1
a source close to mr @entity3 said there was concern that the @entity2 was being exploited by ‘ more and more ’ people from overseas , putting a strain on services			0
‘ the @entity2 is becoming the global health service , ’ the source said			0
‘ we are looking at the way in which services are open to people			0
you have to be ordinarily resident to access healthcare			0
‘ we have to have a look at that and whether there is a prospect of changing that			0
we are looking in a bit more detail at the contributions you need [ to have paid ] to be entitled to free healthcare			1
’ the habitual residence test is used to decide whether migrants from the @entity140 and elsewhere are eligible for certain benefits			0
last month work and pensions secretary @entity103 said he wanted to see the test extended to all handouts , so that no one can claim a benefit unless they can show they have rented a home here for at least a year			2
ministers want to get to grips with the issue before the expected influx of thousands of @entity154 and @entity155 next year once @entity140 restrictions are lifted .			2

care may be restricted to those who have lived in @entity5 more than a year
@entity161 say scheme only works if those entitled to free care can prove it
