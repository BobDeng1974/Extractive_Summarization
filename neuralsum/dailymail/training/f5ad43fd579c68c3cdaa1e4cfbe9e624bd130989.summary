by @entity0 published : 14:11 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 17 april 2013 ' absurd ' : education secretary @entity1 , pictured at @entity2 yesterday , wants the clause removed teachers could be stripped of the ‘ absurd ’ right to refuse to do basic work - related tasks such as photocopying and stapling			1
contracts currently contain a clause that states they can not be ordered to carry out day - to - day duties that millions of other workers do as part of their job			2
@entity1 today spelled out his intention to end the practice by referring it to the independent @entity20 , which looks at pay and conditions			1
in a letter to chairman dame @entity24 he wrote there is ‘ a need to review the framework for non-pay conditions ’ that will give schools the ‘ flexibilities they need to deliver outstanding education provision ’			2
the ban on 21 routine administrative and clerical tasks was introduced in 2003 , when support staff took over the duties			1
the list included collecting money for school trips , stapling reports together , investigating a pupil ’s absence , keeping records and putting up displays in classrooms			1
they were also exempted from analysing exam results or pupils ’ reports - both essential to identify weaknesses			0
it was approved by most unions except the @entity52 , which argued classroom assistants would be expected to do more if workloads were reduced - meaning more lessons taken by people not qualified as teachers			2
the @entity20 has been asked to send its recommendations to mr @entity1 by january next year			1
these could include removing the clause from the teachers ’ employment contract			1
those that continued to refuse to do the tasks would be in breach of contract			2
the @entity1 ’s letter will further inflame relations with teachers ’ unions the @entity52 and @entity71 , which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them , have already announced a series of strikes later this year over pay , pensions and conditions			1
earlier this week the @entity79 unveiled guidelines on how to appraise performance related pay , which is being introduced from september			0
they included taking pupils ’ performance and behaviour into account			0
banned job : the clause in the contracts prohibit teachers from being forced to carry out 21 administrative tasks such as stapling , keeping records and photocopying unions are also opposed to fundamental reforms to the @entity96 and exam formats			1
a government source said some of the items on the list of prohibited tasks were ‘ absurd ’			2
they added : ‘ teachers should n’t be forbidden from analysing why their pupils might be struggling and all teachers who want to improve the reputation of the profession should support sensible reform			0
‘ decisions on these issues and things like how best to prepare classes are much better made by teachers on the ground , heads of department and headteachers - not by politicians and union leaders			0
’ a @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity20 has said that there needs to be a consistent national framework for the profession			0
‘ it is now appropriate for the @entity20 to consider the full range of those aspects of the @entity126			0
’ but @entity71 general secretary @entity127 said : ‘ the letter shows the depth of contempt the @entity131 has for the teaching profession , for schools , and for children and young people			0
‘ he is determined to remove any provisions which support teachers in working effectively to raise standards			0

contracts currently prohibit teachers being forced to do *simple* tasks
list of 21 ' banned jobs ' include , stapling , keeping records and photocopying
education secretary @entity1 has asked for practice to be reviewed
