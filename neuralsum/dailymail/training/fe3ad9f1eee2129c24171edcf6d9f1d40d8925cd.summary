time travel and teleportation are staples in many sci - fi films , such as @entity4			1
but some physicists say they will likely become possible before the end of this century			2
while time travel may be the most ambitious feat of engineering , they say that it might be possible by 2100 , while space tourism and invisibility cloaks will probably become available within just 15 years			1
in research among a panel of top @entity16 scientists and a study of 11 - 16 year olds commissioned by @entity37 , scientists said that teleportation could become a daily activity by 2080			1
the children polled thought time travel , which is seen in @entity19 , might be possible 63 years from now , but scientists were not quite so optimistic			1
@entity42 , author of @entity43 in @entity44 , estimates humans will be able to jump ahead to see our future by 2100 – just 85 years away			2
to boldly go : teleportation , as seen in @entity4 ( pictured ) could become a regular occurrence by 2080 , according to dr @entity49 of @entity24			1
' the good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it can not be done , ' she said physicists have come up with predictions of when technology seen in films such as @entity19 , @entity4 , @entity30 and @entity29 will become a reality			1
time travel : by 2100 teleportation : by 2080 invisibility cloaks : by 2030 personal space travel : by 2015 ‘ @entity60 to the future has already been achieved , but only in tiny amounts , ’ he said			1
‘ the record is 0.02 seconds set by cosmonaut @entity69			0
while that does n't sound too impressive , it does show that time travel to the future is possible and that the amount of time travel could n't be far greater			1
‘ if you travelled through space on a big loop at 10 per cent the speed of light for what seemed to you like six months , approximately six months and one day would have passed on @entity79			0
‘ you 'd have time travelled a day into the future			0
travel at the same speed for 10 years and you 'll time travel nearly three weeks into the future			1
‘ i would say we are looking at 2100 as a very optimistic timescale for travelling weeks into the future			0
’ teleportation however , which is a key feature in @entity4 , could become a regular occurrence by 2080 , according to dr @entity49 from the @entity88 at the @entity24			2
the end is in sight : we may get our hands on @entity30 - style invisibility cloaks and be able to go on holiday in space in just 15 years ’ time			1
scientists have developed many different invisibility technologies , but have yet to fashion a fabric cloak			0
this device aligns four lenses in a certain manner to make an object ' invisible ' a vision of the future : @entity104 of @entity23 said : ‘ with developments such as @entity107 allowing us to create previously impossible materials , it ’s entirely feasible that we could see a @entity30 - like invisibility cloak within the next 10 to 20 years ’ a still from the film featuring the extraordinary cloak is pictured @entity42 , author of @entity43 in @entity44 , estimates humans will be able to jump ahead to see our future by 2100 – 85 years away			2

’ the polled children were just two years out , predicting this will happen in 63 years			1
‘ teleporting a person , atom by atom , will be very difficult … but perhaps developments in chemistry or molecular biology will allow us to do it more quickly , ’ she explained			0
‘ the good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it can not be done and with technical advances i would estimate teleportation that we see in the films will be with us by 2080			2
’ she said that physicists have achieved reliable teleportation , but it has only been done with electrons so far			2
‘ to put this into perspective when thinking about human teleportation , an atom can have many electrons and a person is made of billions of atoms , ’ she said			2
however , we may get our hands on @entity30 - style invisibility cloaks and be able to go on holiday in space in just 15 years ’ time			1
@entity104 , professor of experimental @entity167 at @entity23 said : ‘ one way to create an “ invisibility cloak ” is to use adaptive camouflage , which involves taking a film of the background of an object or person and projecting it onto the front to give the illusion of vanishing			0
‘ we ’re actually not that far away from this becoming a reality – rudimentary technology versions of this have already been created – but the main problem is that the fibre - like structures in the adaptive camouflage need to be so tightly woven that it ’s incredibly labour intensive			2
up up and away : the panel of school children predicted that it will take another 30 years ’ time before they will be able to holiday in space			1
however , commercial space flights are expected to blast off in 2015 with @entity191 offering suborbital flights ( illustrated ) ‘ with developments such as @entity107 allowing us to create previously impossible materials , it ’s entirely feasible that we could see a @entity30 - like invisibility cloak within the next 10 to 20 years			1
’ the panel of school children surveyed dramatically underestimated when they might be able to be tourists in space , believing that it will take another 30 years ’ time before this becomes a feature of their lives			1
however , commercial space flights are expected to blast off in 2015 with @entity191 offering suborbital flights			2
@entity206 is projected to fly to a height of 68miles ( 110km ) , going beyond the defined boundary of space 62miles ( 100 km ) and lengthening the experience of weightlessness for its passengers			0
@entity213 , ceo of @entity214 , said : ‘ the amazing and seemingly impossible things they see in films and television is acting as a stimulant for young people to think about what they could be capable of doing in the future			0
‘ almost a fifth of young people surveyed said they dream of becoming a lightsaber developer and 22 per cent want to be a teleporting instructor			0
‘ more than a quarter even said they would consider a career as a time travel engineer , so we will need to think carefully about how we could provide useful careers advice for that 27 per cent			1
’ the @entity37 is the @entity16 ’s largest celebration of science and engineering for young people , and aim is to inspire the of scientists			2
it will take place at @entity238 from march 11 - 14 , 2015			0

physicists have come up with predictions of when technology seen in films such as @entity19 and @entity4 will become a reality
they say invisibility cloaks and space tourism will happen within 15 years
time travel and teleportation will take *longer* , but progress is being made
children were also polled about when they expect to see the *breakthroughs* and were *surprised* to find they may come *sooner* than expected
research was conducted by @entity266 - a science event in the @entity16
