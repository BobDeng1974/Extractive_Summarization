by @entity1 reporter food packaging could soon feature a label that changes colour to let you know if it has gone off			1
a @entity8 company today launched the smart labels that ' activate ' when a package is opened and change colour using a traffic light system to indicate whether the contents are still safe to eat			1
pre-packaged foods like ham or cheese need to be eaten within a certain number of days of being opened - even if they are still within the use - by date			1
fresh thinking : the label changes from brown , to orange , to purple , depending on how edible the food still is it is hoped the smart labels will cut food waste by preventing customers throwing out food they wrongly believe has gone off			1
a typical @entity28 throws away around £ 700 worth of edible food a year , often because they are being over-cautious with open packets in the fridge			1
professor @entity33 invented the technology for the ' smart plastic ' when he worked at the @entity36 in @entity37 and has spent five years refining the idea			2
the labels were launched today by @entity40 , who say they have had interest from retailers and supermarket chains in the @entity8 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
each one will add around 2p to the cost of a packet of food			1
experts are also working on similar systems for fresh fruit and vegetables , food and drink in jars or bottles , and cosmetics such as mascara or contact lens solution			1
prof @entity61 , now a professor in @entity62 at @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ' it is a huge development for consumers and for the food industry			1
it has got real potential			0
' we have all gone to the fridge and thought " i ca n't remember how long ago i opened that " , and we err on the side of caution and tend to throw it away			1
@entity76 ... but is it still nice ? labels will ensure you know food is still ok to be eaten once it has been left in the fridge for a while ' this indicator is focused on how long the package has been open			1
this is vital to prevent good food being thrown away			1
' it would reassure you that it 's only been open for a day , and it is fine to eat			0
' anything that makes a dent into food waste is a good thing			2
the levels of food waste areunsustainable			2
' it 's also brilliant for frozen foods that have been defrosted , as then the best before date does n't apply			0
look familiar ? for most people , a fridge this full is a rare sight - but perhaps not for much longer ' this has the potential to make a very big difference to the way we use packaged goods , whether foods or other materials			0
' the labels work with foods that have been packaged in a modified atmosphere using carbon dioxide ( @entity115 )			0
each features a central disc bordered by three segments - a brown one for ' just opened ' , an orange one for ' use soon ' and a purple one for ' past best			2
' when the packet is opened , the co2 released triggers a timer in the label so it begins changing colour			1
it can be adjusted by varying the thickness of a special film covering the label so it will turn purple for ' past best ' at between two and seven days			2
@entity40 ' chief operating officer @entity130 said : ' it 's all systems go			0
i think it is fantastic			0
it is a real , genuine innovation for the food packaging sector			2
' it is something which can help restore shoppers ' confidence			0
' the company , based in @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , received backing from @entity145 and private investors			0
it is also working on developing a similar system using stickers which can be applied to items such as fruit , cosmetics or even pharmaceutical drugs			0
delicately flavoured goods such as coffee and spices could also benefit , as consumers could use the system to tell if they still taste their best .			0

label begins to change colour once the packet is opened
different colours mean food is safe , should be eaten soon or has gone off
