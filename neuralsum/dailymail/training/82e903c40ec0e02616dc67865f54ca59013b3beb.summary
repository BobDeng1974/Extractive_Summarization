it was undoubtedly the most engaging weekend of the @entity1 season so far and the 40 goals to fly in came within a whisker of breaking records			2
defenders seemingly under little pressure - most notably @entity8 's @entity7 - thrashed through their own net to aid already swashbuckling attacking oppositions up and down the country			1
rather cruelly , it was a sight to behold			0
an average of four goals - a - game was just three short of the most scored during a 10 - fixture set in the 20 - team era			1
@entity18 scored twice as @entity19 thrashed @entity8 8 - 0 at @entity20 's this weekend saints were helped on their way enormously by the barbaric own goal of @entity24 @entity7 the weekend was three goals shy of february 2011 's 43 - goal record ( as @entity27 scored vs @entity28 ) @entity27 netted a late equaliser as @entity30 battled back from four goals down to draw 4 - 4 against @entity28 @entity32 heads home as @entity34 beat newly - promoted @entity35 5 - 3 at @entity36 on february 5 , 2011 matchday 8 - 40 goals matchday 7 - 27 goals matchday 6 - 26 goals matchday 5 - 32 goals matchday 4 - 30 goals matchday 3 - 32 goals matchday 2 - 23 goals matchday 1 - 26 goals that came in february 2011 , with @entity34 , @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity46 all scoring four goals or more on the saturday as the weekend totalled an astonishing 43			1
the @entity34 knocked five past gung - ho @entity35 after coming back from 3 - 1 down at @entity36			1
events at @entity49 were even more surreal as the @entity52 - home and dry four goals to the good at the break - somehow conspired to only leave the @entity55 with a point			0
@entity27 rifled in a stunning 87th minute equaliser to finish one of the most dramatic afternoons in @entity61 football			0
@entity62 's @entity46 had got in on the act , edging a seven - goal thriller with @entity65 netting twice from midfield			2
the clashes on that weekend - february 5/6 - were far closer than some of the thumpings handed out this time			2
@entity65 wheels away in delight on scoring for @entity46 against @entity72 on the same afternoon @entity73 scored all four goals as champions @entity75 beat @entity76 4 - 1 on saturday @entity77 one of the best strikers in the world - @entity79 @entity80 follows the ball in after scoring an own goal during @entity84 's last - gasp defeat against @entity85 @entity87 's side had looked like taking all three points after @entity90 ' late goals off the bench @entity19 dazzled as much as @entity8 were dismal at @entity20 's - @entity18 notching two as @entity93 pulled the strings for @entity96 's side			1
helped drastically by @entity7 's moment of madness and @entity100 's bundled own goal , of course , but @entity19 offered reasons to believe they are capable of continuing their early promise			0
four - goal @entity73 had earlier swept @entity76 aside at the @entity106 in the 4 - 1 win while @entity34 comfortably beat @entity108 3 - 0			1
taking into consideration what had preceded it , the four swings in the final moments at @entity111 as @entity85 somehow overcame @entity84 was as predictable as it was stunning			0
it meant - when taking sunday 's matches into consideration - that there were eight more nets bulging than any other matchday this campaign .			0

@entity19 thumped @entity8 8 - 0 at @entity20 's on saturday
@entity75 had earlier beaten @entity76 4 - 1 thanks to @entity73
it almost beat the 43 goals scored in february 2011
that record stands from the *inception* of a 20 - team league in 1995
@entity34 , @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity46 all scored four times that weekend
