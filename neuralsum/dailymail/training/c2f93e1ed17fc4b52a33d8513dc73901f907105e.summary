the @entity2 women 's cycling team were meant to be showing the world what they were made of as they posed in their new kit this week			2
but they appeared to show a little too much as all eyes were drawn to the bizarre new flesh - coloured design stretching across their lower torso			1
as the smiling athletes took to the stage , they seemed blissfully unaware of the blunder , which left them looking completely exposed at the groin			0
the race is held in honour of former @entity20 champion , @entity30 , whose promising career was cut short when she died in a car crash in 1994 at just 21 years old			0
. it is difficult to ascertain whether the outrageous new strip was a publicity stunt or a genuine fashion faux - pas but the team may think twice about turning out in it again			0
the design has caused a stir on social media - with many ranking it among the worst kits ever seen at a sporting event			1
some joked on @entity46 that they had gone out to buy the kit , while others criticised the stunt for going too far			0
comparisons were also made with other sporting fashion mishaps - such as the @entity54 team 's kit at this summer 's @entity55 which involved a strange tartan and blue spotted design			2
@entity59 ambition : the six athletes pose for a photo with one of their coaches ahead of this week 's race the @entity66 2010 squad had a similarly embarrassing moment when they revealed their kit - complete with a ridiculous bulging groin a member of the @entity66 2010 squad shows a little too much to the camera equally bad : several posts on @entity46 said the @entity2 kit was on a par with the outfit worn by the @entity54 team at this summer 's @entity55			1
