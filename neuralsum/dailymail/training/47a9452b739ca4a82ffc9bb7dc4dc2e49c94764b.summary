@entity1 , they say , is a time for reflection			2
at 3.01pm , @entity3 wore the horrified look of a beaten man left to wonder where it had all gone wrong , and if it would ever go right again			1
@entity8 , his captain no less , had just gift - wrapped @entity10 ’s opening goal inside 30 seconds and his side were staring at an 11th league match without victory			1
then , though , came a hearty helping of festive fortune ; two home penalties denied and an equalising goal – against the run of play – which only looped into the back of the net thanks to a @entity23 divot after @entity24 had taken aim from 25 yards			1
@entity27 defender @entity26 ( left ) scores their second goal against @entity10 at the @entity23 @entity31 's header flies past @entity10 keeper @entity32 and into the roof of the net in the 51st minute @entity26 headed the visitors in front after half - time and @entity38 made certain of their first away win since the opening day of the season in stoppage - time			1
@entity3 ’s luck was in and his side were out of the bottom three			1
and , after his fourth straight victory over the club who sacked him three years ago , the @entity45 reflected : ‘ we needed a victory			2
i take no real pleasure in that it ’s four straight wins here			0
but the vast majority might just have a little look and think “ he did n’t do a bad job here after all ”			0
' people say i 'm a black and white ( @entity59 fan ) , well today i 'm pleased to be			0
' it had been a nightmare start when @entity8 ' blunder allowed @entity63 to score			1
‘ sometimes there is no hiding place , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ it was awful , a horrible mistake			0
after that it would have been easy to capitulate			0
it took us about 20 minutes to settle but after that the best team won at a canter			2
’ @entity10 winger @entity63 rounds goalkeeper @entity73 to score the opening goal against @entity27 @entity63 scored the opening goal in the first minute following a poor back pass from @entity8 @entity10 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity32 6.5 ; @entity77 5.5 ( @entity78 84 ) , @entity79 6 , @entity80 5.5 , @entity81 6 ; cattermole 5.5 ; @entity63 6.5 , @entity82 6 , @entity83 6 ( @entity84 62 , 5.5 ) , @entity85 6 ( @entity86 62 , 6 ) ; @entity87 6 subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 scorers : @entity63 1 bookings : @entity82 , @entity77 , @entity87 , @entity81 manager : @entity96 6 @entity27 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity73 6 ; @entity31 7 , @entity3 6.5 , @entity8 5 , @entity97 6 ; @entity98 6 , @entity99 7 , @entity100 6.5 , @entity101 6.5 ( @entity102 88 ) ; ramirez 7.5 ( @entity103 77 , 6 ) ; @entity104 6 ( @entity38 89 ) subs : @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 scorers : ramirez 33 , @entity31 52 , @entity38 90 bookings : @entity31 manager : @entity3 7 referee : @entity114 attendance : 44 , 817 man - of - the - match : @entity24 @entity117 stat : former @entity10 boss @entity3 has now beaten his old club four times since last november			1
@entity24 equalised for @entity27 after a sweeping cross-field love - click here for more from our brilliant @entity123 service @entity96 , meanwhile , had urged his team to build on the euphoria of last weekend ’s win at @entity59 and , when @entity128 hero @entity63 punished @entity8 ’ error to put them in front , he must have thought victory was theirs			1
complacency , though , was to prove their undoing , as was the failure of @entity114 to award a penalty when both @entity138 and @entity100 handled inside the area			0
@entity96 fumed : ‘ it was one of the worst afternoons in terms of decisions			0
‘ you do n’t need to ask if they were penalties			0
i ’ve got a great life and i ’m not going to give the @entity147 a penny			0
‘ but we had the perfect start and did n’t take advantage of that			0
‘ until the penalty incidents it was a normal game			0
after the penalty incidents the game changed completely			0
@entity63 slides the ball into the net to put @entity10 ahead in the @entity160 clash on @entity161 @entity27 went into the match without a win in 10 games and were behind after a minute following a defensive lapse @entity63 followed his late winner against @entity59 by grabbing an early goal against @entity27 on @entity161 ‘ the atmosphere inside the stadium and the emotion of the players changed , it was strange			1
we spent too much energy thinking why they were not given			0
‘ but i was disappointed with the second - half performance			0
’ of the penalty appeals , @entity3 said : ‘ for me , the referee has got them right			1
@entity100 had his hand protecting his face			0
when it ’s that close how are you supposed to get out the way ? the referee showed common sense			0
’ @entity8 , though , had threatened to ruin @entity3 ’s return to @entity188			1
it was a day too late for the @entity190 and @entity191 stocking filler , but the skipper made a late entry for defensive howler of the year			0
having rolled his backpass hopelessly short , he had a chance to spare further embarrassment by swiping the ball to the stands			0
instead , however , he attempted to shepherd possession back to @entity73 and was very quickly robbed by @entity63			2
he duly rounded @entity73 – whose indecision was in part culpable to the farcical concession – and slotted into the empty net			0
@entity3 ’s face told its own sorry story			2
@entity10 should have doubled their lead with the visitors shaken but the closest they came was when @entity82 fired on goal from @entity63 ’s pullback only for @entity97 to slide and deflect wide			1
@entity24 's shot skipped up off a divot and looped into the back of the net in the 33rd minute @entity24 ( right ) of @entity27 celebrates his equaliser against @entity10 with team - mate @entity99 @entity24 ( second left ) is congratulated by @entity27 manager @entity3 after scoring the equaliser at @entity10 then came the equaliser			1
@entity24 drifted infield and dispatched low towards the bottom corner			2
@entity32 had it covered , or so he thought , and the big @entity221 was helpless as the ball skipped up off a divot and into the net			0
@entity3 needed luck on his side twice more before the break as well			2
@entity63 strode into the area from the right and when his dribble was cut short by the hand of @entity3 , the 44,817 inside the stadium expected @entity114 to point to the spot			1
two minutes later and the whistler was refusing the hosts another penalty when @entity100 ’s palm blocked @entity83 ’s cross , albeit from point - blank range			2
@entity3 junior then bailed out his dad with a goal - line clearance from @entity82 ’s header and @entity73 shovelled @entity77 ’s near - post blast around the upright			1
half - time was a welcome arrival for the @entity249 chief but whatever he said during the interval served as inspiration for his side and they were ahead on 52 minutes			2
@entity24 swung over his corner from the right and @entity26 escaped @entity80 to flash home his first since the opening day of the season			1
the hosts offered nothing in response and substitute @entity38 made sure of the points as he broke clear before tucking beneath @entity32 in stoppage - time			1
@entity3 , at last , was reflecting on victory .			1

@entity3 's men were behind within 30 seconds after @entity63 punished @entity8 ' calamitous error
@entity24 levelled from *distance* with @entity27 's first goal in *333* minutes of *football*
defender @entity26 equalised and substitute @entity38 completed a *remarkable* *fightback*
@entity27 moved out of drop zone after claiming first victory in 11 @entity160 games
