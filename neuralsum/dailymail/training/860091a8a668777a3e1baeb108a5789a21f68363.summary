@entity0 won the battle of the @entity2 , but it is @entity5 's @entity4 who live to fight another @entity7 day			1
in the most bruising of all the encounters at these finals – 54 fouls is a record – it was hardly the setting for the tournament poster boys to shine			0
but while @entity5 showed flashes , @entity0 burned brightly			1
@entity0 , though , had bugged @entity4 throughout			1
he recovered from each attempt to maim his frame – @entity38 the chief culprit – and was the heartbeat of his side ’s forward forays			0
@entity4 were already two goals to the good - @entity45 and @entity46 on target - by the time @entity0 ’s sixth goal of the finals halved the deficit with 11 minutes remaining and , try as he might , a deserved equaliser eluded the @entity51 star			1
@entity5 , who had assisted @entity45 ’s early opener , did eventually fall foul amid the rough stuff and , after @entity56 ’s knee landed in the small of his back , he left the field in tears on a stretcher			2
it later emerged that @entity5 had broken a vertebrae in his back			2
his @entity7 is over , as is @entity0 ’s			0
both of them will be sorely missed			0
here , @entity65 runs you through the most anticipated head - to - head of the finals so far ... danger : @entity0 's heat map demonstrates the pockets he was populating hot : @entity5 's involvement was not as concentrated but he still got on the ball in good areas @entity76 - to - head : @entity5 and @entity0 's stats compared on the front foot : how did they compare in the final third ? clock watch : @entity5 versus @entity0 3min – the pair have to wait three minutes for an involvement of note and on players find team - mates with ease – nerve - settlers , if they needed them that is			1
4min – @entity5 sizes a free - kick 25 yards out but , despite beating the @entity21 wall , his effort also evades the target and drifts harmlessly wide			1
he is human , after all			0
7min – goal : @entity4 1 @entity21 0 – @entity5 wins the corner and takes the corner from which skipper @entity45 bundles home from close range			1
that ’s his first assist of the finals , although to be fair he ’s scored most of @entity4 ’s goals			0
lucky charm : @entity5 receives a kiss from the player escort before the game flying : @entity5 enjoyed a bright start to the game but faded as the first half wore on 12min – @entity5 is at the heart of everything and , after skipping clear of a red shirt on halfway , he attempts to spring the front - running @entity116 clear but the pass is intercepted , just			2
14min – @entity0 has seen precious little of the ball but when he finally does he ’ll probably be wishing he had n’t , @entity4 ’s @entity38 upending him after a hefty challenge on the halfway - line			1
a little reducer from the @entity124 enforcer			0
marked man : @entity0 feels the force of @entity38 's challenge again 20min – @entity5 delivers another pair of teasing flag - kicks but this time @entity21 are alert to the danger and clear			1
21min – @entity0 escapes down the left and steals a yard for the cross but his final ball is poor and is hacked clear at the near post			0
22min – @entity0 shows his class with a mazy run and neat pass but @entity139 fails to match his comrade ’s enterprise and his contribution comes to nothing			0
the @entity144 is just starting to work his way into the game			0
eventually : @entity0 escapes his minders but it comes to nothing 31min – it has been break - neck stuff and , amid the frenzy , @entity5 ’s radar has malfunctioned as he is guilty of a couple of wayward passes			1
we can forgive him that , though			0
37min – @entity0 takes an age to measure a free - kick 20 yards out but his curler is blocked by two yellow shirts who broke suspiciously early from the wall			2
42min – @entity21 are still to fashion a real chance and @entity0 is again let down by his team - mates having drove forward and found @entity165 on the left , who miscontrolled			1
44min – @entity5 wriggles free of his minder on the fringe of the penalty area and is duly impeded , winning a free - kick which he curls wide of @entity173 ’s goal			1
replays show it was n’t as close as the @entity177 ’s pained expression had suggested			0
same again ? @entity0 had shaped to repeat his wonder goal from the last 16 but instead teed up a team - mate half - time : @entity4 1 @entity21 0 47min – @entity5 showboats inside the @entity21 half with an outrageous piece of skill to evade his man but then beats himself with a step - over too many and possession is lost			1
it ’s been that sort of night for him			0
50min – with shades of @entity190 , @entity0 buys himself two yards of space 25 yards from goal but rather than shoot elects to play in @entity194 only for his through - ball to deflect into the grateful arms of @entity197			2
55mins – @entity5 continues to be careless with his distribution and another pass goes astray			0
63min – it ’s @entity5 ’s turn to feel the force of some heavy treatment as @entity203 sends his crashing to the turf on the left - wing			2
@entity5 dusts himself off to deliver a lofted free - kick to the far post but @entity209 claims			2
the delivery had too much height on , if anything			0
67min – @entity0 sees yellow for a sliding challenge which fells @entity215 and the @entity216 makes a point – quite rightly – of reminding the referee of the five fouls committed on himself which went unpunished			0
fall guy : @entity0 's foul on @entity215 led to @entity4 's second goal 68min – goal : @entity4 2 @entity21 0 – and from the resulting free - kick @entity46 steps up to dispatch an absolute stunner into the top corner , all but booking the hosts ’ place in the last four			1
@entity230 contest the award of the free - kick but it matters not			0
73min – @entity5 wants in on the act but the measurements of his carefully - designed curler are slightly out and the ball drifts wide with @entity173 scrambling			2
77min – @entity5 kills dead a ball dropping from the sky just inside the area but within a split - second @entity241 is on him and snuffs out the danger			0
78min – @entity0 is the architect as his slick through - ball frees @entity245 and the substitute is upended by the on - rushing @entity197 , who escapes a red card but concedes a penalty			2
79min – goal : @entity4 2 @entity21 1 – and it is @entity0 who takes responsibility and nonchalantly rolls the ball into the bottom corner for his sixth of the tournament			1
spot on : @entity0 rolls home his sixth of the tournament 84min – @entity4 are clinging on and , with @entity5 missing , it ’s @entity0 taking centre stage as his side chase what had seemed an unlikely equaliser			1
86min – @entity5 is left in a heap after @entity56 ’s knee thunders into his back and that ’s enough to end his evening , the forward leaving the action in tears and on a stretcher			0
crying shame : @entity5 is in tears as he is stretchered from the action 90min – @entity0 has to be careful otherwise he could be following @entity5 down the tunnel , the @entity21 man barging @entity272 off the ball at the expense of a free - kick and then arguing his cause a little too forcefully with the referee			1
93min – @entity0 serves up another whipped corner but @entity56 ’s header skips wide and @entity4 survive			2
full - time : @entity4 2 @entity21 1			1

@entity0 scores sixth goal of tournament from penalty spot but @entity21 go down to 2 - 1 defeat
@entity45 and @entity46 had put @entity4 2 - 0 in front
@entity5 ruled out of rest of tournament with broken vertebrae
