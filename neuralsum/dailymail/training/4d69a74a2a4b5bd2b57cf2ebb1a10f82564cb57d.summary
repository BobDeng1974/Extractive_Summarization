last weekend against @entity0 had appeared to represent a significant step forward but instead of hammering their foot down on the accelerator , @entity2 threatened to stall once again at @entity5			1
for so long here , it seemed that this would be another desperate day for @entity9 , another afternoon where his long - term credentials at the club would be questioned			0
failure to win on friday would have meant just four victories in 16 games in all competitions			0
not since 1992 - the first season of the @entity18 era - had @entity2 been as low as 10th on christmas day			1
for the first hour of this game , things looked destined to take yet another turn for the worse			0
this felt like an old - fashioned @entity29 fixture , with @entity5 packed to the rafters with families , from grandparents to toddlers , filling out all sides of this charismatic old stadium			2
in that first - half , a @entity24 goal appeared inevitable , the home side every bit as enterprising and vibrant as their visitors were anaemic and listless			1
@entity2 looked ripe for a giant - killing			2
the problem for @entity9 these days is that his side 's issues are not contained to one area			0
instead , the malaise spreads throughout the team , from back to front and the current 3 - 5 - 2 formation with @entity55 in defence , @entity57 at wing back and @entity22 as the lone striker feels rather akin to putting a flimsy plaster on an open wound			1
once again at @entity5 , @entity2 had no focal point in the final third			1
@entity22 scuttled around , dribbled with purpose and finished with composure to decide the game but the feeling remains that his considerable qualities are wasted in this position			2
@entity22 dribbled with purpose but was not the focal point @entity9 needs in attack it only serves to underline @entity2 's impotency in front of goal			1
they had just five shots in this game			0
before this match , @entity2 's seven forward players - @entity22 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 - had played 4,435 minutes in the @entity18 this season			1
taken together , they had scored just seven goals - averaging a goal every 663 minutes - or every 7 or so games			0
it is a quite stunning statistic and a damning indictment of the transfer committee reportedly responsible for @entity2 's summer transfer strategy			2
@entity9 will hope that a solution can be uncovered in the january sales or that @entity84 recovers sooner rather than later			0
@entity2 boss @entity9 has a number of pressing issues with his line - up from back to front perhaps even more urgent is the need to recruit a goalkeeper of elite standing			2
@entity104 pulled up in this game after 16 minutes and the most anxious of performances from @entity107 suggests that his spell out of the team team has done little to improve his state of mind			1
he looked horribly short of confidence , skewing long - kicks out of play , flapping at crosses and causing all sorts of panic for those in front of him			2
clearly , @entity107 is a more talented goalkeeper than the recent months suggest and there must be some sympathy for him			0
it is difficult to imagine what it must be like when the quicksands of self - doubt takes hold , when the opposition supporters goad you with chants of ' you 're * * * * and you know you are ' , as an unforgiving @entity24 home crowd did here			0
even more presing is keeper @entity107 's lack of form and now an injury to @entity104 @entity104 leaves the pitch with an injury paving the way for @entity107 's return for @entity2 an unforgiving @entity24 crowe chanted to @entity107 : ' you 're * * * * and you know you are ' as it transpired , @entity107 survived here and who knows , the clean sheet may restore some confidence to the stricken @entity149			1
he was bullied and harried but he survived			0
maybe , just maybe , it could be a turning point for both @entity107 and @entity2			1
that , however , must be countered against a growing number inside @entity153 that perceive that this struggle extends beyond a crisis of confidence and that @entity107 instead simply lacks the requisite qualities to be a first - choice goalkeeper at a club of @entity2 's aspirations			1
@entity9 will certainly hope for the former and he will also view this result as fundamental in the club 's attempts to hunt down the seven point gap that separates his side from @entity166 as they look to secure @entity168 football for next season			0
if that is to be achieved , @entity2 must make a major step up from this performance .			0

@entity2 beat @entity24 at @entity5 *courtesy* of a @entity22 goal
keeper @entity107 can on as a *substitute* for injured @entity104
@entity107 's clean sheet may be a confidence boost for the @entity149
@entity22 playing at striker underlines the @entity184 ' impotency in front of goal
@entity2 rose to ninth in the @entity18 after the win at @entity24
