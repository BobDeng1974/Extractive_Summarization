@entity0 is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill @entity3 's boots at @entity4 ... not playing for @entity5 if @entity6 leaves @entity7 for @entity8 he will be considered an expensive @entity10 flop true measure of a top coach like @entity13 or @entity14 is to find a lower - league gem and make him into a world beater like @entity18 or @entity19 @entity20 and @entity21 have a telepathic understanding that gives @entity5 a fighting chance at @entity24 i 'm surprised how much @entity27 ’s second autobiography made me laugh			1
and who knew he would let his daily horoscope decide his career path ? more importantly the book told me that @entity27 should be the next @entity32 manager			1
the more i read what he had to say , and his reflections on his two jobs as a boss , the more i realised how perfect he would be at @entity37			0
@entity38 may be a legend at @entity32 , but learning how to manage on the job is not what you should be doing at a club like that			1
if @entity38 takes over it means @entity32 are giving that massive job to a rookie			1
any appointment is a gamble , but that ’s one they do n’t need to risk			0
@entity27 has the @entity32 history			1
he understands how top players work			1
he can deal with the expectations			0
he took over a club that was in turmoil , losing games and potentially dropping into the third tier of @entity77 football			0
he turned them into a winning machine in a short space of time and took them up as champions			2
the next season he kept them in the @entity10			0
then after a ridiculous disagreement with the owner @entity87 , @entity27 and @entity57 parted company			1
it was a bizarre end to his successful time there			2
@entity27 's new autobiography @entity93 has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past week @entity38 ( left ) has been learning his managerial trade under @entity14 at @entity32 @entity27 walked into a club with huge expectations , at a very low ebb and turned them around			1
he admits his mistakes , and even better he learned from them			0
his time at @entity58 was n’t good at all – but then not many managers in the last 10 years have done anything at that club			2
the massive lesson he learned there was communication , with the owner and others running the club			0
because that communication failed , @entity58 ended up paying massively over the top transfer fees for players			1
they really did pay £ 1.7million for @entity116			0
@entity27 and sir @entity117 fell out towards the end of his time at @entity37 @entity27 , pictured with @entity120 , led @entity57 to promotion in his first managerial job @entity27 's next job at @entity58 was tougher - but no manager has had success there in the last decade that ’s a lesson learned that he can take into his next job – managing upwards at a club , dealing with the board , the chairman and the chief executive			1
i like how he accepts criticism for some of his decisions – like selling goalscorer @entity137 when he was at @entity138			0
a man who takes the blame is a man who ’s on top of his ego			0
he ’s now getting experience as an assistant at @entity10 and international level			0
is he on top of his anger ? probably not totally , but he might need a bit of that to deal with issues at a big club like @entity32			2
he had a player turning up late regularly at @entity57 , and when @entity27 dropped him as punishment , the player ’s agent phoned to make the excuse that the player lived on a busy junction			1
@entity27 was always a fierce leader on the pitch during his years as @entity32 captain @entity27 won seven @entity10 titles and four @entity162 in his time at @entity37 if you were @entity27 , you ’d be angry			1
is he in control of his inner chimp ? well @entity27 says in his autobiography he tried to read the book @entity169 by the sports psychiatrist dr @entity170			2
but he admitted he could n’t get through it – his inner chimp would n’t let him			0
@entity27 is made to be manager of @entity32			2
when @entity14 ’s work is done , the time will be right for the @entity175 to be welcomed back to @entity37			0
@entity176 ? i do n't know - @entity27			2

@entity27 has learned from his time managing @entity57 and @entity58
former *midfielder* understands @entity32 and top players
@entity38 is a @entity32 legend but should not be learning on the job
