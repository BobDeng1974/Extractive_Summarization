by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:37 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 05:55 est , 4 november 2013 the troubled @entity2 is to shut around 50 branches as part of a rescue plan			1
investors and hedge funds will take control of the bank in an attempt to plug a £ 1.5 billion black hole in its finances			1
the bank ran into trouble after buying the @entity15 and a later - abandoned attempt to buy hundreds of @entity18 branches			1
the co-operative group will only keep a 30 per cent stake in the bank , but insists its ethical practices will remain embedded in the firm the deal will see @entity25 lose overall control of its banking arm , which has traded on its reputation for ethical behaviour , and retain just a 30 per cent stake			1
the funerals - to - supermarkets group had initially hoped to retain control of the ethical lender by giving bond investors a minority stake in return for a £ 500 million loss on their debt			1
but bondholders , including @entity43 hedge funds @entity41 and @entity44 , will take control of the bank under the new plan , which will see it listed on the stock market next year			1
the co-op 's loss of control of the bank has raised concerns among some customers			2
the bank has traditionally attracted organisations like trade unions and charities because of its ethical approach			2
but the co-op said its values and ethics will be ‘ legally embedded ’ in the lender 's new rules			1
investors must now vote to back the plan , and the co-op warned that the bank will fall into state hands through the resolution process if they do not , leaving investors empty - handed			1
@entity25 chief executive @entity70 insists it will retain ' effective control ' of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder the group announced plans to close around 50 of its 324 bank branches , about 15 per cent of its estate , without revealing how many jobs will go among the lender 's 9,000 staff			2
the co-op has faced tough questions over the impact on the bank 's ethical values from the new plan to cede control to predatory @entity43 hedge funds and blue - chip investors			1
@entity25 chief executive @entity70 had insisted the group , which traces its roots back to the @entity93 in 1844 , will retain ‘ effective control ’ of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder			2
he said last month the co-operative principles will be embedded in the constitution of the bank			0
mr @entity70 said today : ' we recognise the huge importance of ethics and values for all our customers and remain committed to upholding them			0
' its turnaround is expected to take four to five years , and will shift its focus to households and small and medium - sized businesses			0
the co-op added that the bank 's outlook remains ' challenging ' , although monthly bad debt charges have fallen			0
the co-op will be the bank 's single biggest shareholder , and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent the co-op had originally said there would be ‘ no plan b ’ for its recapitalisation , which would have seen the co-op retain control through a stock market flotation - a turnaround strategy requiring a £ 500 million contribution from bondholders , with £ 1 billion coming from the group			1
but bondholders led by @entity43 hedge funds @entity41 and @entity44 - who own 43 % of the higher - ranking bonds which had been due to be hit - ratcheted up the pressure on the bank , proposing an alternative plan of converting more debt into shares			0
the new deal is expected to need approval from 80 per cent of shareholders , with a vote set to take place before the year end			0
the @entity2 's woes have been blamed on soured corporate loans , many of which were acquired with its takeover of @entity15 in 2009			0
retail investors such as pensioners who bought the bank 's bonds for a steady income will be offered a choice between two types of bond - one paying income and another repaying the principal they invested - although they will still suffer losses			2
@entity161 , who campaigned for retail investors , said : ' this deal has been extremely hard - fought and is now a much better solution for retail holders and pensioners			0
' the @entity25 will contribute £ 462 million to the bank 's turnaround , including £ 129 million handed to retail investors , £ 333 million in cash and £ 40 million in interest savings			2
investors such as hedge funds will take up to 70 per cent of the bank 's equity through a combination of converting debt to shares , buying equity and acquiring fresh bank debt			0
the co-op will be the bank 's single biggest shareholder , and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent			0
' that will give us a key role in shaping the bank 's future direction , ' mr @entity70 added .			0
