his impressive series of pictures capture a rare view of @entity12 only viewable from thousands of feet in the air			2
some of the sights include a ' desert footprint ' in the @entity17 wheatfields , a fried - egg shape between @entity19 and @entity20 and what looks like a human sperm - which @entity6 has entitled ' desert seed '			1
this image looks like a human sperm , and @entity6 has named it @entity27			1
the picture was taken somewhere between @entity29 and @entity20 red planet : mr @entity6 captured this stunning image somewhere between @entity32 and @entity20 the @entity34 - born 34 - year - old is a producer and director at the @entity36 so is used to traversing the globe in search of impressive natural wonders			1
but his in - transit images , shot with a @entity41 , make for a remarkable gallery of an untamed continent			2
he explains : ' as a director for the @entity36 , i spend a lot of time flying around the world , and it is n't long before i 've exhausted all of the onboard movies			1
this stunning image of the @entity17 coastline was taken somewhere between @entity19 and @entity20 fields resemble crazy marble paving from the skies over @entity12			2
mr @entity6 took this picture somewhere between @entity32 and @entity20 lava flow ? mountains resemble the debris from a volcano from the air			2
this photograph was shot somewhere between @entity19 and @entity20 @entity6 took the images to kill time while flying around the world for his @entity36 natural history job ' to keep myself occupied i make sure that i always have my camera with me , and i think carefully before choosing my seat			1
' i check out the path that the flight might take , consider which side will give me the best view , what time of day and where the sun will be , and most importantly make sure that i am as far away from the wing as possible - my favourite seat is a couple of rows from the back			1
' my favourite continent to fly over is @entity12			0
' the sky is usually cloudless offering a clear view , it 's often sunny and it 's always spectacular			0
purple haze : this impressive natural wonder was photographed somewhere between @entity19 and @entity20 a naturally formed desert footprint in the @entity17 wheatfields mr @entity6 took this aerial image of downtown @entity20 and the @entity91 while aboard a commercial flight this mock lunar landscape was captured on camera somewhere between @entity19 and @entity20 ' it 's like flying over the surface of @entity97 and i find myself captivated by the vivid expressions of the underlying geology , i find myself captivated by the vivid expressions of the underlying geology			1
the patterns of red and orange , dry lake beds and giant sand dunes			0
' he added : ' @entity12 is one of the oldest and most stable continental landmasses , the mountains have been worn down , much of the soil has been blow away , and with little vegetation able to survive in the arid red centre it reads like a living geological map			0
' the folds and layers of the ancient sediments stretch out on one enormous flat canvas , dissected by ribbon - like rivers such as the @entity119 , the countries second longest			0
you can fly for hours without seeing any sign of human life , but then slowly the landscape evolves			0
this image was taken somewhere between @entity32 and @entity20 and provides a rare snapshot of @entity12 from above fields and farms captured from the air , somewhere between @entity19 and @entity20 this image could be molten lava , or it could be the surface of a leaf			0
but it is actually the @entity17 landscape captured from the skies by photographer @entity6 mr @entity6 has called this image @entity137			1
it shows quarries in western @entity12 's wheatbelt and was taken while the photographer was flying for his job with the @entity36 ' i recently flew from @entity32 to @entity20 and as the red desert waned , the vast angular blocks of the wheat belt came into view , like a yellow chequer board stretching to the horizon			2
' it covers 155,000 square kilometres , larger than the whole of @entity150 and only where ancient lakes are found does the land remain untamed			0
scattered across this patchwork of monoculture are thousands of abandoned old quarries , like paint pots , some blood red , others yolk yellow			0
' as @entity20 drew closer the fields became smaller and houses started to appear , clustering closer and closer until i reached the modern world , the towering metropolis of downtown @entity20 on the banks of the @entity91			0
" this could be a golden sculpture or parchment			0
but it is actually a farm near @entity20 photographed from the air a fried egg shaped quarry captured from the skies between @entity19 and @entity20 by @entity34 - born mr @entity6 since 2003 , @entity6 has worked on a range of high profile tv series including , @entity176 , life , and how @entity177 made @entity178			1
