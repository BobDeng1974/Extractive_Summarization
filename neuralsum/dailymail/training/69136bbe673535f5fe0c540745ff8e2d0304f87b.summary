by @entity0 supermarket giant @entity2 has been misleading its customers about its ' freshly baked ' bread , the @entity1 has ruled			1
on wednesday , it was found labelling on the supermarket 's @entity7 and @entity9 products that stated the goods were ' @entity11 , @entity13 ' - and in some cases ' @entity15 ' - were false , misleading and deceptive			1
the @entity1 has ruled @entity2 has been misleading its consumers about its ' freshly baked ' bread products it was found the products were partially baked and frozen off - site , then transported and finished in store at a @entity2 bakery			1
additionally , the @entity7 range was baked and frozen overseas			0
the products were then promoted as ' @entity23 , @entity24 ' or ' @entity15 '			1
they were also placed near signs that read ' freshly baked ' or ' @entity27 '			0
the court ruled @entity2 was giving a misleading representation that the partially baked bread products had been baked on the day of sale or baked in a fresh process using fresh not frozen product			1
when handing down his judgment , chief justice @entity34 said it was not the court 's place to dish out advice on how @entity2 ran its operations , but urged it to look at the way it promoted its bread products			2
@entity44 chairman @entity43 ( left ) said the move from @entity2 gave them a competitive advantage			2
but @entity2 spokesman @entity48 ( right ) said it was never their intention to mislead the public ' a start would , however , be to make it tolerably clear to the public that the recent baking was the completion of a baking process that had taken place sometime before , off site , and that " freshly baked " actually meant the completion of the baking process of frozen product prepared and frozen off site by suppliers , ' he said			1
@entity44 chairman @entity43 said they had been concerned about @entity2 ' misleading claims			2
' these claims also placed independently - owned and franchised bakeries that freshly baked bread from scratch each day at a competitive disadvantage , ' he said			0
' today 's decision confirms that @entity2 misled consumers about the baking of these bread products			0
the bread was being baked off - site and not in - store , and in some cases overseas ' consumers should be able to rely on the accuracy of credence claims made by businesses like @entity2 to promote their products , especially where those claims are used to compete with smaller businesses which are genuinely offering a differentiated product			1
' according to the @entity44 , credence claims are representations of a premium or special characteristic that are difficult for a consumer to test the accuracy for themselves			0
they can be a powerful marketing tool that can be used to mislead consumers if they are not used properly , which can have the potential to impact on the competitive process			0
these claims are a priority area for the @entity44 at this point in time			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity48 said it was never their intention to mislead the public about their breads and would be changing its labelling soon			2
' whether baked from scratch in - store or " par baked " by our suppliers and finished in our ovens , our bread and baked goods are great quality products which taste great and are convenient for customers			1
they have won a number of awards around the country , ' he said			0
' in talking to customers about the ‘ par - baked ’ bread range , we certainly never set out to deliberately mislead anybody , but we completely accept that we could have done a better job in explaining how the products are baked			2
' we are already well advanced in changing product packaging and other information			0
' the @entity1 will hand down its court orders to @entity2 in @entity124 at a later date , with @entity126 reporting the supermarket giant could face a fine of up to $ 1 million			1
the @entity44 is seeking penalties , declarations , injunctions , costs and other orders .			0

@entity9 goods state they *'re* ' @entity23 , @entity24 '
but @entity1 ruled that the supermarket giant had mislead the public
it was found products were partially baked off - site , *including* overseas , before being finished in - store
the @entity44 said the claim by @entity2 put smaller chains at a disadvantage
@entity1 will hand penalties down to supermarket giant at a later date
