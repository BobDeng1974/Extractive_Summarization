he said he first realised he 'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded , which had more than 2000 likes			2
they then made a @entity51 page and a @entity34 channel and # @entity60 has since taken off			1
mr @entity7 said he has been recognised on the street before , but he had resigned himself to the humiliation			1
' it 's just so embarrassing , in all honesty , having people recognise you as someone who yells at your kids with all those expletives , ' he said			0
' but it says a bit about society that people can relate			0
' it 's not ideal , the last thing i want is this stuff spread around but what can i do ? ' you try getting followed around with a camera , it 's just ridiculous			0
' mr @entity7 said he had to have an awkward conversation with his boss about the videos , but apart from the embarrassment the videos had n't caused him too much trouble in his professional life			1
' i work for a media company , i 'm one of the senior executives there , and it 's almost embarrassing to have to explain it to him , ' he said			0
' people at work have seen it , but at the end of the day i keep my private life and professional life separate			0
' and they do n't have to live with my two little pr * * * s as kids			0
' ' these two s * * * heads have been doing this for five , six , seven years , ' mr @entity7 said of @entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) constantly chasing him with a camera he said he first realised he 'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded , which had more than 2000 likes of all the videos they 've filmed , he said he was most annoyed when his sons followed him to @entity13 when he was hungover and had lied to say he was getting sushi			1
' my wife is a fitness fanatic and getting caught at @entity13 , having @entity19 jump out from behind a garbage bin and have him film it â€¦ it 's not worth going through the pain , ' he said			1
but his wife @entity118 just thinks the situation is payback for the trouble he used to give her father when he was @entity19 and @entity20 's age			2

' my friends keep saying ' why do n't you do this , why do n't you do that ? ' he said			0
' but the last thing you want to do is escalate it			0
' i 'm just hoping it will die its natural death , i do n't think retaliation is a good way to help it die down and make it go away			0

' despite being pranked so many times mr @entity7 says he has no plans to hit back at @entity19 and @entity20			1
and mr @entity7 insisted the videos were authentic and not staged , despite the fact that he has invested in an app that finds and sells ' user generated content ' to media companies			1
' those who know me know that what you see what you get in terms of dealing with this whole frustration , ' he said			0
' that 's just an app that i 've invested in that i 've developed over last 18 months , it has no relevance , i 'm just working on a side project			0
' this angry @entity2 rubbish has got no bearing on that			2
