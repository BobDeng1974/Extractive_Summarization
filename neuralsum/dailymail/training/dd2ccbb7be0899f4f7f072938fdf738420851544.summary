by @entity0 huge storms have been erupting on @entity2 – and they are so enormous they can be easily seen using telescopes on @entity5			1
the swirling clouds and violent winds are being driven by massive bands of jet streams that can surround the entire planet			0
astronomers in @entity12 said they were ' surprised ' by the bright storms they observed this week , including one that they described as ' monstrous '			2
massive storms on @entity2 captured august 5 and 6 , 2014 as seen by @entity18 in @entity12			1
@entity19 said they were ' surprised ' by the bright storms , particulary one that they described as a ' monstrous ' @entity2 boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph ( 900 km / h )			1
it has massive storms that could engulf continents on @entity5 , and temperatures in the -220 ° @entity30 ) range			1
scientists believe the planet 's strange tilt is the reason behind this bizarre weather system			1
the @entity5 has seasons because the axis tilts , and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away			0
these two pictures of @entity2 - one in true colour ( left ) and the other in false colour - were compiled from images returned january 17 , 1986			2
there were taken by the narrow - angle camera of @entity50 but @entity2 has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane			2
it also spins backwards , compared to the other planets , making its tilt 98 degrees			0
this causes 21 - year - long seasons and unusual cold weather			0
for nearly a quarter of the @entity2 year - equal to 84 @entity5 years - the sun shines directly over each pole			1

' we are always anxious to see that first image of the night of any planet or satellite , as we never know what it might have in store for us , ' said @entity96 , professor at @entity97 and team leader			0
' this extremely bright feature we saw on 6 august 2014 reminds me of a similarly bright storm we saw on @entity2 's southern hemisphere during the years leading up to and at equinox '			2
' even after years of observing , a new picture of @entity2 from @entity18 can stop me in my tracks and make me say wow ! ' , said @entity107 , a member of the observing team			0
since the 2007 equinox on the planet , @entity2 's northern pole has been coming into view , and the south pole is no longer visible			2
the bright feature @entity115 refers to was known as the ' @entity116 ' , because it was visible just below the polar haze , and resembled an iceberg peeled off an ice - shelf			1
the @entity116 oscillated in latitude between southern latitudes of 32 and 36 degrees since 2000 , and perhaps dated back to the @entity50 era in 1986			0
the present storm is even brighter than the @entity116			0
its morphology is similar , and the team expects it may also be tied to a vortex in the deeper atmosphere			0
while today we know more about @entity2 ' amazing weather systems , when @entity50 went by in 1986 nothing much seemed to be happening			2
as the hurricanes @entity133 and @entity134 gain in strength near @entity12 , it will be interesting to see how the storms on another world also continue to evolve			0

@entity2 has a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph ( 900 km / h )
its storms could engulf continents on @entity5 with temperatures at -220 ° c
the planet 's strange tilt is the reason behind this bizarre weather system
one feature , which resembles an iceberg peeled off an ice - shelf , is of particular interest to astronomers who are viewing the planet from @entity12
