@entity0 has called on @entity2 fans to ' forgive and forget ' after being booed on the podium for the second successive race			1
following his collision on the second lap of the @entity8 @entity7 with @entity10 team - mate @entity9 , which led to the @entity11 later retiring , @entity0 was severely heckled as he collected his trophy for finishing second			1
@entity0 suggested post-race it was ' the @entity15 people ' who had turned against him , but the scenes following the @entity17 @entity7 on sunday confirmed it was not just @entity9 's countrymen now against him			1
being cast in the role of villain , when for so long he has been viewed as a nice guy , is clearly a concern for @entity0			1
' it 's obviously not nice , but what can i say ? ' said @entity0			2
' i hope that with time they forgive and forget			2
fan - fare : huge crowds were in front of the podium but it was n't a warm welcome for second - placed @entity0 sour taste : @entity0 and @entity9 sprayed the champagne after completing a one - two at the @entity17 gp ' i have apologised , i ca n't really do anything more than that			1
' even @entity9 , booed himself in @entity17 in the past , has claimed he felt ' awkward ... to hear them booing @entity0			1
' @entity10 motorsport boss @entity54 has also called on the fans to lay off his driver , who he feels is being affected by the situation			0
' first of all , there should n't be any booing on the podium , ' insisted @entity54			0
enough is enough : @entity0 insists the time has come for the boo boys to give it a rest ' that 's for the top three guys who have had a mega-race and , whoever it is , there should n't be booing			2
we 're a sport , sport should unite			0
' all those guys are fans , some of them are pretty emotional , and does it take a toll on you ? yeah , you have to be pretty tough			0
' i do n't even want to think about being booed			0
maybe it 's something you need to survive if you want to make it to the top			0
' @entity84 returns to winning ways			0
