a survey of 2,000 children carried out by the @entity13 has revealed nearly 75 per cent of under 10s had not been inspired to take up a sport in the after glow of the games			1

worrying : despite the government 's hope the @entity4 would encourage youngsters to take up sport , figures show fewer are now participating inspiration : the government had hoped scenes such as @entity29 winning the 800m to take gold in the heptathlon would encourage youngsters to take up sport worryingly for the government , the figures showed there had actually been a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past five years			1
a report published in @entity44 claimed 25 per cent of girls aged between five and 10 had not participated in a sport in the past month - an increase of 17 per cent on the figure five years ago			0
