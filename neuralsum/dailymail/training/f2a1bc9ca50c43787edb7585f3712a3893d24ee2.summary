by @entity0 published : 05:51 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 2 february 2013 the family of a soldier killed in the @entity3 have been reunited with his @entity5 medal - after it turned up in a sewer			1
private @entity8 was killed at @entity9 in may 1915 , aged just 35 , and the posthumous award for his bravery in @entity12 was all his young family had left of him			1
but the bronze campaign medal went missing and was not seen for more than 70 years			1
now the heirloom has been returned to @entity17 's grandchildren @entity16 and @entity18 , after it was found in a @entity20 sewer by a labourer			1
returned : @entity16 with his grandfather 's victory medal after the bronze heirloom was found in a sewer tragic : @entity27 's medal was all his widow @entity28 , right , had left of him after he was killed in @entity9 at 35 found : a worker found the rusting medal dumped outside a sewer at @entity32 , @entity33 , 90 years later the worker 's sister - in - law , retired accountant @entity34 , spent three years tracking down the family so she could return the treasure to its rightful home			1
the 66 - year - old 's achievement is all the more impressive because the medal had been engraved with a slightly wrong name			1
mr @entity16 , from @entity43 , near @entity44 said : ' the phone rang one day and this lady asked if i was @entity16 and did i have relatives in @entity33 called @entity8			1
' she said a family member of hers had been working in sewers in @entity20 and had found a medal and she 'd spent some years since trying to track the rightful owners down			1
' i was quite amazed really			0
especially as my cousin @entity28 had tried to trace where the medal had gone once			2
the fact she spent all this time doing the research for strangers is just amazing			0
' the 70 - year - old - who has never seen the medal - said he had never known much about his grandfather			2
brave : @entity17 received the bronze campaign medal posthumously after he was killed at @entity9 in may 1915 @entity17 signed up to the @entity65 , @entity66 , aged just 16			1
he married @entity67 in 1909 when he was 26 and they settled in @entity33 - on - @entity69 , @entity20			1
after @entity3 broke out , he was posted to @entity9 , and never returned to his wife and children			1
records showed that he was killed in action on saturday , may 1 , 1915 , in the second battle of @entity9 , which claimed 100,000 lives			1
the couple had two daughters - @entity78 , who died in infancy and mr @entity16 's mother @entity81 , who was just two years old when her father was killed			1
a death notice written by @entity28 was printed in the @entity84			0
it read : ' oft we pause and think of you and think of how you died			0
to think you could not say goodbye befire you closed your eyes			0
sadly missed by wife and family			2
' @entity28 remarried after the war in 1923 , and she and her new husband @entity92 had a son called @entity94			0
@entity28 died in her 60s in the 1940s			0
bereaved : the death notice written by @entity28 and printed in the @entity84 search : @entity34 , whose relative found the medal , finally realised it was inscribed with an alias mr @entity16 , a retired television engineer , said : ' i have an old photograph of my father before he set off to war - something all soldiers would do in case they never returned			1
i suppose it 's the same for soldiers fighting today			2
' the sad thing is that he never saw my mother grow up , the kids did n't have a father , and there are still tens of thousands of children today not growing up with fathers because of war			0
' the yellow bronze medal would have originally hung on a ribbon with rainbow colours and was awarded to all those who had served in the @entity123 during the wartime			0
mr @entity16 said : ' it does n't look that impressive now - it 's a bit bashed up and tarnished - but it has historical and sentimental value			0
' it 's just amazing to have it back - it was so unexpected			0
the woman was so relieved she 's found the right family			1
' the question that still remains is , how did it get into the sewer ? i suppose we 'll never know			0
' the medal , inscribed with the words : ' @entity139 ' , was found dumped in drains in @entity33 in 2007 by mrs @entity34 's brother - in - law			1
memento : mr @entity16 with a photograph of his grandfather			0
on the reverse is attached a handwritten verse that private @entity17 had copied from @entity147 's famous poem @entity148 the medal had regiment and number on the side but was engraved with the name ' @entity154 ' , when the soldier 's name was @entity8			1
the labourer did nothing about the discovery for two years , when he handed a bag of lost items he had found to his relative			1
she decided to make it her mission to track down the heroic recipient 's family			1
mrs @entity34 , 66 , from @entity170 , near @entity171 , @entity169 said : ' i knew it was going to be like finding a needle in a haystack , but i was determined to find out whose family the medal belonged and it was the right thing to do			2
' it was a lot of work but well worth it and i 'm so delighted the medal is back with its rightful owners			0
the project suffered a setback when she fell ill , but she picked it up again last year			0
mrs @entity34 contacted the @entity186 in @entity187 - since that was the regiment inscribed on the brass medal			2
' they gave me some information about him that led me looking into old @entity20 archives , but the files were useless - i now know it was because i was looking for the wrong name '			2
the turning point in her quest came after she contacted the @entity198 in @entity199 , who told her his name was @entity8			2
the mother of two said : ' the woman told me it was very common for soldiers to go by another name , in case they were captured and for some reason that name was put on his medal			0
' with the correct name , mrs @entity34 finally managed to track down two possible daughters of mr @entity17			0
she said : ' i found two woman with the name @entity216 - one in @entity217 and one in @entity44 , so i went with the latter			0
i looked up their children and hoped they were n't ex-directory in the phonebook			0
' @entity16 was the fourth one down i called - and i burst with excitement when i found the right family			2
it has now spurred me on to research my own family tree			0
' she was also able to tell mr @entity16 and his sister that their grandfather 's name was engraved on the war memorial statue in @entity9			1
the medal is now pride of place on the family mantelpiece .			2

private @entity8 was killed at @entity9 in may 1915
