by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 22 february 2013 whether they are trying to prove their manliness , their style credentials , or it is just sheer laziness , there appears to be a resurgence of facial hair amongst men and actor @entity8 is leading the way			1
the @entity11 star has topped a poll to find the celebrity with the sexiest facial hair - while onetime heartthrob @entity15 is deemed to have the worst			1
@entity8 - nominated for best actor at sunday 's @entity17 for the musical movie - pipped @entity19 star @entity18 to the top spot			1
best beard : @entity8 was voted as having the sexiest beard while @entity15 , who usually tops the best looking charts , came bottom @entity25 came third and @entity26 was fourth			1
the survey also looked at the celebrities with the unsexiest facial hair			2
@entity15 topped this poll with @entity31 in second and @entity34 star @entity33 - pictured recently with a weird handlebar moustache - in third place			2
the survey also found that 62 per cent of men reckon they look sexier with some kind of facial hair - either a beard , moustache or designer stubble			1
but the same poll found that only 35 per cent of women like men with fuzzy faces - with designer stubble ( 48 per cent of women like it ) far more popular with women than beards ( just 18 per cent like them ) or moustaches ( 15 per cent )			0
facial hair faux pas : @entity18 just missed out on the top spot while @entity31 was at the bottom end of the list surgeon @entity59 from the @entity61 who carried out the research said : ' @entity8 looks great whatever kind of facial hair he has - stubble , a moustache or a beard			1
' dr @entity59 , hair loss expert on the @entity70 show embarrassing bodies who has treated @entity73 , said that beards have never been more fashionable and one of the main reasons is because they make men feel more manly			0
he said : ' for many men , growing a beard or designer stubble defines their masculinity			0
it is not surprising that more than six out of ten believe they look sexier with some form of facial hair			1
' but they might want to pay attention to what the women in their life are saying - they clearly do n't like that manly look quite as much as their partners			0
' boom : people are desperate to get sideburns like olympian @entity98 and even @entity99 have roped in a bearded man for their latest campaign @entity61 saw a surge in bookings last year from men who wanted to get their sideburns bolstered with hair transplants so that they could look like @entity107 hero @entity98			0
@entity108 has also sparked a boom in hair transplants for under - 30s - with a 25 per cent increase in booklngs since the @entity115 striker had his op. dr @entity59 added : ' men want to look like their heroes			0
sadly they ca n't always naturally grow a perfect full beard like @entity8 or have bushy sideburns like @entity98			0
' they will have often patches in their facial hair			2
' that is where a transplant clinic like ours can help - we can fill in their gaps and help men to get the look they desire			0
' @entity8 @entity18 @entity25 @entity26 @entity132 @entity133			2
