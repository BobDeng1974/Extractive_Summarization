by @entity0 @entity1 has launched another stinging attack on @entity3 , whom he believes should either step down as @entity5 captain or take a break from cricket			1
the former record - breaking @entity9 spinner has been @entity3 's most outspoken critic in the last 12 months , and has clearly got under the skin of the @entity12 left - hander , who stated last week that he believes the judgements are becoming personal			1
but in the wake of @entity5 's first ever test series defeat to @entity18 on home soil , just a matter of months after their @entity15 humiliation , @entity1 thinks @entity3 , whose own form has stagnated in the last year , needs to step aside			1
video scroll to the bottom to see @entity1 sing an @entity25 song with his daughter poor spell : @entity1 criticised @entity3 's captaincy in the second test at @entity30 as the worst he 'd ever seen despair : @entity5 lost the series when @entity33 was out with two balls left on the final day writing in his column for the @entity36 , he said : ' there are three ways to go with @entity39			1
everyone sticks their head in the sand and just allows things to keep going as is and hope he finds form with the bat and by a miracle discovers some tactical brains from somewhere			0
' two : he steps down from the captaincy to concentrate on his batting			0
' @entity51 of all , he has a complete break away from the game			0
' lots of people , including me , think it is time for him to step down as captain			2
@entity59 refuses to step down failed again : disappointing form with the bat has only led to greater pressure on @entity3 's captaincy decisions : @entity1 criticised @entity5 's bowling on the fourth day at @entity66 when @entity3 stuck with pace spin king : @entity69 , @entity5 's primary spinner , is only a part - time bowler and @entity3 appeared not to trust him video i 'm gutted for @entity73 and the lads - @entity74 ' the most disappointing thing for me is that he has not learned or improved after a horrible 5 - 0 drumming in @entity9 , in fact he has got worse			1
' he is not thinking straight			0
he does not know what to do and because he is in a rut with his form it makes life a lot worse			0
' you just can not captain a team in transition in that frame of mind			0
' @entity5 suffered a 100 - run defeat to the @entity94 at @entity66 on tuesday to lose the two - @entity96 series after the tourists escaped with a draw in the opening match at @entity100			2
much of the damage in @entity102 was done on day four as @entity18 captain @entity103 was allowed to compile a wonderful 160 to build his side 's lead to 350 before their bowlers reduced @entity3 's men to 57 for five before the close			1
while @entity5 came within two balls of securing a draw on the final day , thanks to @entity69 's century and a last - wicket stand with @entity33 , @entity1 does not think that should hide @entity3 's shortcomings as captain			1
driving force : @entity118 ' superb century took the game away from @entity5 on day four historic : the series victory , inspired by @entity118 , was @entity18 's first ever on @entity123 soil ' on monday at @entity66 i witnessed the worst day of captaincy i have ever seen at international level in almost 25 years in the game			1
' it was horrific , and i am not the only one singing that tune , ' said @entity1 , who is the second highest test wicket - taker of all time with 708 scalps			2
' he just does not get it			0
everyone watching could see the game needed a change of pace ; bowl the spinner or make the seamers try and actually get @entity103 out			0
' you just can not bowl the same stuff over after over like he did - good captains try things and are proactive , not hopeful			0
@entity1 also refuted @entity3 's suggestions that his negative comments were a personal attack as a means to undermine the 29 - year - old 's authority			1
video defeat is tough to take - @entity3 take a break : @entity1 has called on @entity3 to relinquish the captaincy or take some time away from cricket he said : ' this column is not a personal attack and never has been , @entity157			1
mate , you need to improve tactically or @entity5 need someone else in the job			2
' and i am not the only one saying it			0
please speak to ( former @entity5 captains ) @entity165 , @entity166 and other successful captains who were tough , ruthless and got it			2
' also , if i was an @entity169 cheerleader , as the @entity170 thinks i am , i would not be criticising @entity3			1
' i would be saying keep him in the job because that would be the best thing for @entity9 during the @entity15 next year			0
' i have always been open to talking to @entity173 , like i always have with any other player from any country , if they wanted a chat over a beer			0
