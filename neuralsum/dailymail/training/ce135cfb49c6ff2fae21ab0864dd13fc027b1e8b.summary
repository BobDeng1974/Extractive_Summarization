one of the men making a grueling ascent of a half - mile of exposed granite in @entity4 's @entity3 is now 1,000 feet from finishing the groundbreaking climb			1
@entity6 and @entity7 are attempting to become the first men to free - climb - using only hands and feet - the @entity10 of the park 's towering @entity12 rock formation			1
on thursday , @entity7 climbed to a ledge 2,000 feet up , says @entity15 , a photographer and climber who has been chronicling the journey			1
his partner , however , is hundreds of feet below			1
this has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner , and led to the pair taking three ‘ rest days ’ in the hope the skin will heal			1
this weekend , after a short break , @entity6 plans to try surpassing the particularly difficult section lower down once more			1
@entity7 and @entity6 are relying completely on their physical strength and dexterity to make their way up the @entity26 , a vertical face on one side of @entity12			1
@entity7 could become the first to accomplish the feat. progress : @entity7 makes his way up the rock face last sunday			1
if all goes well , he could do it this weekend do n't look down : @entity6 calculates his next move up the mountain despite suffering cuts to his fingers the men have been climbing toward the 3,000 - foot summit for two weeks			1
speaking from the foot of the @entity26 at the start , @entity15 , a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair , told the @entity100 their spirits are still high			0
‘ they remain determined to complete the climb , ’ he says			2
‘ they are definitely going for the top			0
they say they are not coming down until they ’ve got there			0
the human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there			0
‘ the granite flakes when you grip it , creating tiny razor - sharp edges which cut the skin deep			2
@entity6 has taped up his fingers to protect them , but underneath , the skin is dry like toast			1
’ while many people have climbed the @entity26 — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins , no one has ever free - climbed it in a single attempt			1
although the pair are clipped to ropes , they must not use them to help in the ascent			0
instead , the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet			2
the men , who started the expedition on december 27 , begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm , just two hours before sunset			2
december and january were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip			2
climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer			2
but @entity3 has been unusually warm this winter , so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night , using head torches			2
@entity22 pulls on a relatively big hold during the climb precarious : the climbers have been living in a vertical world for weeks logistics : aside from the actual climbing , the climbers have a great deal of work to do managing their ropes on the long climb filmed all the way : a cameraman hangs from the rock face awaiting the arrival of @entity7 and @entity22 daring : free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent			1
above , @entity7 makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on @entity12 using a headlamp on sunday night up they go : @entity6 , 30 ( left ) , and @entity7 , 36 ( right ) , reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb @entity3 's @entity12 earlier this week			1
they 've now been forced to separate at the dead of night , temperatures can plummet to well below freezing , as ice - cold winds sweep across the face of the rock			2
at midnight , after nine hours of climbing , they clamber into their ‘ portaledges ’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face			0
each has a stove to cook dried pasta , chilli and vegetables , brought by a six - strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp			0
on occasion , the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘ to take off the edge ’ , @entity7 says			2
before bed , they treat their cuts , grazes and bruises			0
writing from his tent via social media , @entity7 says : ‘ it ’s the most chapping environment in the world up here			1
[ it feels like ] we ’re grabbing razor blades			0
i wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands			0
’ bizarrely , they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew , charting their ascent , camps alongside them			0
‘ we have three double “ portaledges ” set up			0
it ’s like a five - star hotel up here ! ’ @entity7 says			1
in truth , few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep			0
they wake at 10am and have breakfast			0
by then the sun is out and they use solar - powered devices to charge their smart phones , and report back via social media to base camp , as well as family , friends and supporters			0
@entity15 believes @entity6 and @entity7 — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week			1
the greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather , or an acute injury to the hands			0
but even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature ’s greatest challenges .			0
