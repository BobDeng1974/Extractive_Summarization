when a fresh - faced dancer from @entity3 's @entity2 met a @entity5 photographer in @entity6 , little did she know she was about to be thrown into the world of a @entity9 cocaine ring			1
@entity10 was 21 years old when she travelled to the @entity12 capital to dance with world - famous cabaret troupe @entity15 and later on the @entity16			1
it was her first day in @entity6 in 1976 when she first caught a glimpse of a @entity5 man - only known as @entity20 - and the attraction was immediate			1
ms @entity10 has now penned a book about her 10 - year relationship with @entity20 , who turned out to be a drug dealer , called ' dancing with a cocaine cowboy '			1
@entity10 ( left ) was a dance for famous cabaret @entity15 when she met @entity20 ( right ) when they first met , @entity20 told ms @entity10 he was a photographer and because he was carrying a @entity30 camera at the time , she had no reason to doubt his story otherwise			1
but soon the 21 - year - old realised her ' glamorous life ' of ' flashy cars , fur coats , diamonds and gold ' was funded by profits of a @entity5 drug syndicate operating in @entity6 with the help of her new lover			1
during her long - term relationship with @entity20 , ms @entity10 said she had witnessed a number of drug raids			1
it was @entity20 who introduced her to cocaine - but ms @entity10 said she was never an addict			1
two years after meeting @entity20 , she gave birth to @entity52 ( pictured with ms @entity10 and her former @entity5 lover ) the 59 - year - old now lives in @entity55 on the coast of @entity57 ' it 's a bit like having a glass of wine at night			1
you 'd do a bit of cocaine at night , ' she told @entity66			0
despite popular opinion , ms @entity10 said the cocaine scene was never a ' sleazy ' one			1
' i do n't actually know the full details [ of the operation ] and he never told me what was going on , ' she said			0
' @entity5 's gross domestic product was cocaine ... and cocaine was a drug for the elite and there was money to be made			1
' it 's a party drug and people who were high - profile lawyers were the kind of people who did cocaine			2
' most of the expat dancers rented accommodation close to @entity90 in impossibly tiny studios that cost the earth			0
there were a couple of sisters from @entity97 , some @entity98 and lots of @entity101 girls and boys			0
we ’d catch up and chat about our lives and swap the latest gossip in between costume changes or waiting in the wings : who was sleeping with whom ; who was going to be axed ; what work was in the wind			2
but i rarely socialised with my dance friends outside of work because @entity20 was the focus of my life			2
of an evening he ’d zoom me to work in his flashy @entity118 then usually meet me after the show for a late supper before we headed off into the night			0
there was always a party somewhere and new friends , a trendier club , a fancier restaurant			0
wherever there was cocaine there were the wealthy , the chic , the artistic , the models , and @entity20 was at the centre , vibrant , charming , engaging			2
usually it would be close to dawn before we finally slid into bed , aroused by the charge of cocaine			0
our desire for each other was insatiable , our erotic play steamy , lascivious and sensual			0
lustful pleasure and intimacy consumed us			0
i savoured the subdued times too ; usually when we had outdone ourselves in the night scene we ’d restore our souls with a quiet stroll along the @entity147 , a movie or a wander up narrow laneways into obscure book stores , galleries and gardens			0
the @entity154 ’ new album saturday @entity155 was playing in all the nightclubs and we could n’t get enough of it			0
‘ how @entity158 is your love ? ’ still resonates with me 30 - odd years later , as does the @entity162 ’ ‘ @entity161 flow ’			2
occasionally i ’ll hear them play and am immediately transported back to the time when @entity20 and i were immersed in a blazing romance			2
ms @entity10 said she adapted well to her new lifestyle because she was ' really in love ' with @entity20 and - growing up on @entity3 's @entity2 - she was accustomed to the drug scene			1
' you would see people smoke drugs and they still do , ' she said			0
' people were growing pot at the back of high school and growing bushy weeds in greenhouses in @entity176			0
' so i was n't frightened of being surrounding people doing drugs			0
we were hippies smoking dope			0
' i was optimistic and i did n't think anything bad was ever going to happen			0
' ms @entity10 said she still keeps in contact with @entity20 despite their relationship ending 30 years ago two years after she met @entity20 , ms @entity10 gave birth to her first child , @entity52 , who she says is evidence of the love she shared with the @entity5 drug dealer			1
but soon the bliss of a child soured as @entity20 's infidelity started eating away at their relationship			1
' @entity20 was a bit of a lothario			2
i had doubts about his fidelity , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' his dalliances became unbridled infidelity , and i tried to ignore it for a long time			0
' ms @entity10 's only other solace - apart from her son - was dancing			1
during her decade - long relationship with @entity20 , her career as a dancer also took off and took her to @entity209 , the @entity101 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			1
the tall and blonde stunner also did a stint at the world - famous cabaret house , @entity16 , in @entity6			1
there were full houses every night , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' there were feathers and diamantes			0
it was a very glamorous show and it was one of the most prestigious shows			0
' it was n't until later when i grew up , i realised that i had accomplished a lot and had such success			0
' ms @entity10 had been a dancer since she was six years old and danced for the @entity16 finally the instability of her lifestyle and @entity20 's indiscretions led ms @entity10 to take back control of her life			1
at 28 , she and her son moved back to @entity98 and settled in @entity236 , but @entity20 soon followed			1
' for the next three years , i would visit him in @entity9 and he continued to provide for us , ' she said			2
' then when he was deported from @entity98 [ for drug - related offences ] that was the end of the relationship			2
' ms @entity10 , who is now 59 and lives in @entity55 on coastal @entity57 , said she still kept in touch with @entity20 - in his 70s - who lives in @entity5			1
' it 's hard not to stay connected			2
we remain connected in a bizarre way , ' she said			0
' the ties have never really been cut even though we 've lived separate lives for 30 years			2
' dancing with a cocaine cowboy is published by @entity250 and is now available online .			0
