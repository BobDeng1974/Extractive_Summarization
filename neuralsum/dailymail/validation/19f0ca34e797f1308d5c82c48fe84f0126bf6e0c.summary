it went on for an age and a shambolic @entity3 side went home before it got interesting			2
@entity5 editor @entity5 picks his highlights and lowlights of the @entity8 ... best bits the renaissance of left - arm seamers the yorkers produced at will by man of the tournament @entity15 played a huge part in @entity18 ’s triumph			1
@entity20 ’s @entity19 joined him on top of the wicket - taking list with 22			2
and the most uplifting spell of the competition was @entity27 ’s @entity26 in the quarter - final			0
@entity30 @entity29 took 22 wickets to be rated as the man of the tournament at the @entity8 @entity34 ’ one - wicket win over @entity18 in a @entity8 containing more hundreds than ever before ( 38 ) , no game was more thrilling than the low - scoring thriller at @entity37 in @entity38			1
set 152 , @entity20 slipped from 131 for 4 to 146 for 9 , before @entity39 sealed it with a six amid scenes of delirium			1
here was proof that the best games do n’t need to be run - fests			0
kiwi @entity39 hit a late six to seal a memorable one - wicket win over @entity18 in the group stages the @entity48 the first couple of weeks were lit up by teams who will mainly be shut out of the @entity52 , which the @entity53 have limited to 10 teams : @entity56 beat @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity55 gave @entity20 a scare , and @entity60 beat @entity55			1
while other sports look to expand their games , cricket ’s administrators remain content to shrink theirs			0
@entity65 celebrates taking a wicket as @entity56 sensationally upset @entity57 in @entity67 @entity68 still going strong @entity70 ’s quarter - final defeat by @entity71 meant @entity68 ’s one - day international career ended with a whimper — but not before he had scored an astonishing four successive centuries in the group matches			1
even at 37 , he remained the classiest act in the @entity8			0
@entity77 veteran batsman @entity68 acknowledges one of four successive centuries the fans more than a million spectators attended the 49 games , with the @entity20 public getting behind the @entity8 in a manner that delighted the @entity53			1
if cricket ’s popularity in that country has been guaranteed for the next decade and beyond , the @entity8 will have done its job			0
the @entity8 attracted over a million supporters for 49 games , some left more pleased than others @entity95 bits @entity3 they were the laughing stock , completing the worst of their six @entity99 since reaching the final in 1992 — and there ’s been some stiff competition			2
they never recovered from maulings by @entity18 and @entity20 , failed to defend over 300 against @entity70 , and even lost to @entity106			1
for captain @entity108 , the whole thing was a disaster			0
new odi captain @entity108 presided over @entity3 's worst performance at a @entity8 too few close finishes four one - sided quarter - finals typified a tournament in which too few of the games went to the wire , or even close to it			1
in fact , of the seven knockout matches , only the @entity20 - @entity71 semi-final raised the pulse			2
and , as in 2011 , the group stage dragged on and on and on			0
@entity20 's semi-final defeat of @entity71 was the only knockout game that entertained the final @entity18 ’s dominance turned the climax into an anti-climax			1
let ’s not pretend , as some have tried , that this was the best @entity8 ever			0
the @entity30 were too far ahead of the rest for that , brushing aside @entity77 in the semis and @entity20 in the final			0
in truth , @entity18 were head and shoulders above the competition as their stroll in the final showed			0

@entity18 defeated @entity20 to be crowned cricket world champions
@entity15 's *bowling* , @entity39 's batting and @entity68 's swan sing were among the highlights
@entity3 's *humiliation* and a one - sided final were two of the low points
