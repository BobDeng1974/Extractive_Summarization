by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 03:42 est , 12 april 2012 every year the @entity1 releases a list of the ten books most frequently reported as banned or challenged by angry parents , schools and libraries across the country			1
and as is often the case , this year 's most reviled author , @entity8 , is in trouble for a tween trilogy deemed unsuitable in content , profane and sexually perverse			1
the controversial themes - that include sex , drugs and alcohol - are not the only thing to spark outrage from conservative readers across the nation			2
the books are written entirely in instant message language			2
innocent ? tween author who writes in instant message shorthand has topped the list of @entity26 's most banned books with her series about high school girls ms @entity8 's series about three high school friends entitled @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , are apparently so incendiary they have been banned from a town in @entity35 where parents are disgusted by the profanity and sexually explicit nature of the book			1
while she acknowledges that the abbreviated language creates an initial barrier for adults , when it comes to subject matter , the author only pays attention to the positive feedback she receives from readers themselves			2
she told @entity49 : ' my favorite comments come from girls who say , " i feel like you ’ve given me a self - help book because my parents wo n’t talk about this			2
" ' when i was a kid , i read @entity57 to figure out what a hard - on was and what to do when you got your period , so when people say to me , " you ’re this generation 's @entity57 , " i am wildly honored by that			1
' @entity66 : @entity8 's series tackles themes like sex , drugs and alcohol she is also reluctant to take responsibility for exposing children to issues that they do n't already know about , a common charge among many parents			1
' parents are n’t always realistic , ' she explained			2
' one said to me , " i ca n’t believe you introduced my 13 - year - old daughter to thong underwear			0
" i ’m pretty sure she knows about them already			0

to kill a @entity109 - @entity108 in fact contrary to the accusations flying at her from those who call her ' @entity118 's handmaiden ' and a ' pedophile ' , ms @entity8 's hope is that girls will read her books and reflect on the bad decisions they might otherwise have made without thinking of the consequences			1
' one girl goes to a college party when she ’s still in high school			0
she gets egged on to take her shirt off			0
pictures get taken , ' she summarised			0
' i do n’t write books to teach lessons , but if a girl can read a story like that and think , " maybe i wo n’t take off my shirt at a frat party when people have phones there , " my work is done			0
' other books on the list include a graphic novel by @entity88 that upset people with its images of nudity , @entity146 by @entity91 and the @entity106 series			1
also featured were legendary classics like @entity102 's @entity103 and seminal novel to kill a mockingbird by @entity108			1
