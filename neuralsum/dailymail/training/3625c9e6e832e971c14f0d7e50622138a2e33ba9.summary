@entity0 faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from @entity3 the nurse who became the first @entity5 to be diagnosed with ebola in the @entity7 faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from @entity3			1
@entity0 , who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in @entity11 earlier this year while her life hung in the balance , is one of five medics being investigated			1
their ‘ fitness to practise ’ is being assessed by regulators			0
according to one unsubstantiated report , a temperature test showed that ms @entity0 was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported			2
in theory , if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards , they could be ‘ struck off ’			0
however , bearing in mind the nature of their lifesaving efforts in @entity3 , they are more likely to receive a slap on the wrist if they fail to clear their names			0
it is understood the investigation centres on claims that signs of ms @entity0 ’s illness were ignored before she flew back from @entity40 to @entity41 , potentially placing fellow passengers at risk			1
the inquiries are an embarrassment for the @entity7 , given the plaudits the country received for the work of @entity7 medical staff in the ebola - hit area			2
the nurse , who had spent three weeks working for @entity52 at an ebola treatment centre , was diagnosed with the virus on her return to @entity56 in december			2
according to reports at the time , she had complained of feeling ill when she landed at @entity59 from @entity40 , but despite having her temperature tested seven times she was cleared to fly on to @entity41			0
when ms @entity0 , 39 , became feverish , she was transferred by @entity62 back to @entity11 to be treated at the @entity63			1
after being treated with blood plasma from an ebola survivor and an experimental new drug , she made a full recovery			0
now ms @entity0 and two other nurses are being investigated by their governing body , the @entity69 , while two doctors in their party are subject to a @entity73 probe			1
the investigation was launched after @entity76 officials carried out a review of the screening process at @entity59 for the 30 @entity80 staff who flew back from the affected region with ms @entity0			2
drama : ms @entity0 recovered after being flown from @entity56 ( pictured ) to @entity11 for treatment an interim hearing to decide whether ms @entity0 should be placed on restricted duties could be held within days : the @entity69 can bar or suspend nurses from the profession because of misconduct or incompetence , or on grounds of ‘ character ’ or poor health			1
officials were forced to trace more than 200 passengers who had sat close to ms @entity0 during her journey from @entity40			2
a @entity52 review concluded that she probably contracted the virus by wearing a visor as part of her protective equipment instead of goggles			0
at the time , the charity ’s chief executive , @entity102 , said : ‘ lessons have already been learned and as a result of the findings we have further tightened our protocols and procedures			0
’ dr @entity110 , who sat next to ms @entity0 on the flight to the @entity7 , said screening procedures at @entity59 were ‘ shambolic ’			1
last night , the nursing council and @entity73 confirmed they were investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses and two doctors			0
a spokesman for ms @entity0 said last night : ‘ since she returned from @entity40 , ms @entity0 has fully co-operated with all investigations being undertaken by the relevant bodies and she will continue to do so			1
' these are ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate for her to make any public comment at the present time			0
