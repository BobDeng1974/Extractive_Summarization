their opponents harbour considerable respect for the exploits of @entity22 ’s team – who have lost just once since the last @entity24 – but they are hell - bent on halting the @entity26 juggernaut			1

they have won 35 out of 37 as well ( since the last @entity24 )			2
' to play home and away at international level against the quality of opposition they ’ve played is a phenomenal record and that ’s why they are no 1 in the world			1
ourselves , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are all striving to emulate them			1
' while the series has already been won by @entity2 , their crusade to set new global records and @entity0 ’s determination to finish a promising tour with tangible success means that there will be no shortage of motivation going into saturday ’s @entity4			2
@entity33 outlined just how much the match will mean to his squad			1
' we ’ve made quite a few changes , but definitely not on an experimental basis , ' said the head coach			2
' it ’s certainly a very important game for us			0

' that enables everyone to finish the tour on a positive note and reflect all the hard work done			0
' @entity33 reacted to the announcement of the @entity2 ’ line - up by describing it as a ‘ pretty strong team ’ , which was a masterpiece of under - statement			1

@entity134 is demanding an effective mixture of physical ferocity and calm heads from his men , as they seek a consolation prize			0

' in the first test it was the last five minutes when we did n’t manage the game in the right areas of the field			0
