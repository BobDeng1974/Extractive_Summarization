@entity43 , no doubt buouyed by last season 's ultimately unsuccessful title tilt , rise from 12th place to ninth overtaking @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
@entity4 's rise is down to its rapid commercial growth , and with more deals announced this year they are expected to go from strength to strength despite the debt that remains from the 2005 @entity58 takeover			1
in the 18th edition of the report , which uses figures sourced directly from each club and is put together by @entity64 - based @entity18 ’s @entity63 , @entity33 recorded the largest increase of any outfit in the top five - news @entity68 bosses may see as a vindication of their methods			1

no other region in the world has as many clubs in the top 20 and these clubs play a major role in the @entity97 economy			0
' last year @entity3 clubs benefitted from much larger broadcast revenues thanks to the latest round of deals			1
the @entity3 is currently undertaking its next round of sales of broadcast rights and with the market expectation that another significant increase will occur , it is likely that the @entity17 will have a strongly @entity36 appearance in the coming years			1
