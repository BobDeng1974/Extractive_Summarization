by @entity0 published : 18:22 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 01:21 est , 25 november 2013 a new robot that can fly and mimic the movements of a beachside nuisance was presented to the world on sunday			0
at the @entity9 's @entity11 meeting in @entity12 , designers @entity6 and @entity8 showed off the stunning creation , @entity5 reports			1
both @entity6 and @entity8 are part of @entity16 's @entity15 , according to a press release for their presentation ' hovering of a jellyfish - like flying machine			2
' the robot , seen here , weighs a mere 2g and is 4in across the robot 's wings ' squirt , ' allowing it to move as if it were a flying jellyfish @entity6 , @entity5 reports , said the main challenge of imitating flapping wings is that they are ' inherently unstable			1
' he cited fruit flies , noting that they constantly tweak their motions in response to the elements			0
amazingly , the tiny robot weighs a mere 2g and is 4 inches across , @entity34 reports			2
though it is not autonomous , @entity6 plans to build more robots that are able to fly entirely on their own			0
the robot 's wings ' squirt air ' and give it momentum to lift off , allowing it to move like the jelly , @entity40 reports			1
the wings are connected to a power source via a wire to allow for movement			0
@entity6 said that his robot designs were ' sort of dumb ' -- they stay afloat solely by using their wings			1
' that 's the beauty of the design , ' told @entity40			0
' it does n't need a ' smart ' design to help it recover			0
' explaining the benefits of his research project , @entity6 also told the network that they could be used to monitor air pollution and quality control			2
@entity6 , seen here , called his robot design ' sort of dumb '			1

tiny creation weighs 2g , *measures* 4in across
robot 's four wings ' squirt ' air allowing it to take flight
designer @entity6 said his simple design was ' sort of dumb '
