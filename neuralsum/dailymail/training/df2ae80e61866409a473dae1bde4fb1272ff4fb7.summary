@entity0 will continue to monitor the progress of @entity3 striker @entity2 despite the 21 - year - old just having signed a new contract that ties him to the club until 2020			1
the @entity8 holders know @entity2 's new five - year deal , coupled with the difficulty they have had in the past negotiating with @entity12 , would make him a very difficult to get inside the next two years			1
but they also see @entity3 as a selling club having already taken @entity15 and @entity16 from them and so they will continue to watch the development of the @entity20 under 21 striker who is likely to move up to @entity22 's senior squad next month			1

representatives of the club 's scouting network have watched him several times this season , including on @entity62 when he got the first and the fourth in @entity3 ' 5 - 3 win over @entity66			2
his performance at the weekend has only toughened their resolve to be part of any future race to sign him			0
on the same day that @entity2 was single - handedly deciding the north @entity30 derby , @entity0 were losing the @entity0 derby and their famed front three of @entity74 , @entity16 and @entity75 were failing to muster a single shot on target			1

that is likely to be too early for any move for @entity2 but the @entity3 forward is now firmly on their list of future targets			0
in @entity55 , the @entity3 centre - forward has even been likened to @entity97 's @entity96 who @entity0 tried and failed to sign at the start of last season			2
@entity3 boss @entity108 , however , believes it will be hard for any club to turn @entity2 's head away from @entity112			0
he told @entity115 broadcaster @entity113 last week : ' he has just signed a new deal and there are no buy - out clauses in @entity20 so whatever any club offers they will have to negotiate with the club			0
