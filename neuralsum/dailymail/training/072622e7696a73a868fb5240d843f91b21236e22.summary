by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 30 september 2013 it was the nightmare injury that could have ended his dream lifestyle forever			2
since he started practising aged 14 @entity5 worked tirelessly to become a dj but his career looked to be over after he lost his arm in an accident in 2011			1
but instead it gave him even more determination to succeed and the 25 - year - old is now performing with the likes of @entity14 and @entity15			1
but just two weeks after leaving hospital , and with 70 stitches sill in him , @entity5 was back playing in front of a 1,000 strong crowd , despite not having practised one - handed			1
he said : ' it was the best experience of my life			2
' there was no doubt in my mind that my @entity6 career was n't over when i lost my arm			1
it just spurred me on to do it even more			2
' being a @entity6 is about putting on a good show and giving people something they can take away and remember			2
it is one of the luckiest and rewarding jobs out there			2
' he has held residencies all over the world including in @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 and is now touring the @entity58 , and had a stint on radio with a show on @entity62 earlier this year as part of their ' @entity65 ' scheme			1
all of which is in stark contrast to life following his surgery just two years ago			0
after playing his final gig in @entity24 , he flew back home to @entity74 to recuperate and the reality of what had happened sunk in			1
' i was completely devastated but at the same time i was genuinely happy to be alive because i could have died , ' he said			0
' from that moment on i knew things were never going to be the same			0
there was a lot of mixed emotions			0
it was an emotional overload			0
' it was revealed later that the only reason i did n't die that day is because the dirt and grit from the road clogged up my artery , stopping the bleeding			1
' the decision to amputate was made by @entity5 's nightclub boss as there was no time to wait for mum @entity96 ( right ) to arrive @entity5 is now touring the @entity58 following performances with @entity14 and @entity15 in fact paramedics had told @entity5 that just two more minutes outside an operating theatre could have been fatal			1
the decision to amputate his arm was actually made by his nightclub boss because doctors could n't wait for his mother to arrive from @entity105			1
once back in the @entity58 he had to learn to walk again due to the extensive injuries he suffered to his legs and was virtually housebound , too embarrassed to go out			1
@entity5 added : ' i became a bit of a social recluse			1
i had not come to terms with what happened			0
truth be told it only really sunk in 12 months ago			0
' i felt a bit sorry for myself and like i was missing out on all the action			0
' ambition : @entity5 has dreamed of being a dj for years and started parctising when he was just 14 years old since the accident @entity5 has become a well - known face on the @entity6 circuit and has met artists including rapper @entity122 ( right ) after just four weeks resting at home , he decided enough was enough and booked a ticket to go back to @entity24 to @entity6 again at the resort 's biggest club , @entity125			1
' i was djing every night and sunbathing every day			0
i was back where i belong - i was back home , behind the decks with a crowd in front of me			1
it was no different to before			0
' it was more to prove a point to myself and the other djs			0
i thought to myself it ca n't be that hard			2
i had to do it			0
' i 've achieved quite a lot at a young age but i 've not accomplished anywhere near what i want to do			0
' the dream is to be on a level where i am djing in three or four countries a week , every week			0
i am determined to succeed			0
' @entity5 is also helping to support others like himself as one of the ambassadors for @entity58 charity @entity147			1
fundraising for the charity is very close to his heart as he wants to inspire others who may be going through a similar experience to believe that they can do anything they set their hearts on .			2
