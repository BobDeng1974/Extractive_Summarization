by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the last time @entity4 stood on the pitch at @entity6 , it was all about him			1
this weekend , he will return to find not much has changed			0
@entity4 ' final game as @entity9 manager last may saw his team beat @entity11 2 - 0 and he walked off the field in tears			1
' if i had been an @entity9 fan i would have clapped the manager too , ' he said			1
this time , though , the climate will be different			0
while he has struggled as manager at @entity29 this season , his old club have moved on without him			2
@entity9 under @entity16 already have more points - 66 - than @entity4 ever managed in a season during his 10 years in charge at @entity6 , and nine more than @entity23			1
supporters , meanwhile , remain irritated by the manner in which @entity4 tried to sign @entity37 and @entity38 last august			1
by suggesting @entity9 do ' what is right for the players ' , @entity4 exposed himself not only to accusations of treachery but also hypocrisy			1
in 2009 he had been critical of @entity45 's attempts to sign @entity46 on the back of similar rhetoric			0
@entity50 farewell : @entity9 fans applaud @entity4 after his final match in charge man at work : @entity4 jokes with his players during a training session on thursday ' we have n't forgotten , @entity4 , ' wrote one @entity9 fan on a fans ' forum this week			1
' and if you have , we will remind you on sunday			0
' football can be a nasty , fickle business			0
the hero - villain cycle can be ridiculously short			0
the story of @entity4 ' return to @entity9 , though , has more layers to it than most			1
most surprising , perhaps , has been the apparent attempt by some to sully the @entity73 's legacy at @entity6			0
@entity4 ' 10 - and - a - half seasons on @entity75 saw him establish @entity9 as a top eight @entity77 side during an era when some traditional rivals moved on to financial footings @entity9 could not match			1
as the club swayed under the effect of aborted takeovers and failed stadium projects , the team largely remained a constant positive			0
false promise : @entity4 celebrates goal in @entity88 but @entity89 knocked @entity23 out of @entity90 new regime : @entity9 have moved on under @entity16 @entity16 's progress at the club this season , though , has encouraged some clumsy revisionism			1
the @entity97 's team play better football , according to 92 per cent of those polled on a fan website this week , while stories from inside @entity9 tell of superior inter-personal skills			1
more surprising , though , were youth coach @entity105 's @entity104 comments suggesting @entity4 did n't care about young players while one of those teenagers , @entity107 , has claimed @entity16 's training sessions are ' more tactical '			1
@entity105 's words - subsequently deleted - reflected badly on him and can be traced back to a breakdown in the relationship between the two men			2
@entity105 , for example , felt he did n't receive enough personal thanks when his under 18 side beat @entity117 in the @entity118 last year			0
nevertheless , the words outraged @entity4 and did n't impress @entity9 chairman @entity120 either			1
return fire : @entity4 came under fire over his pursuit of midfielder @entity37 the list of players to emerge from youth academy to first team under @entity4 is long and impressive			1
@entity4 was also behind the move to bring the first team and youth squads together on one site while in 2009 @entity9 had five youth academy products in their playing squad			1
this week one @entity9 source told @entity135 : ' some academy staff did feel as though @entity4 was slow to blood some of their players			1
they thought @entity107 was sent on loan when he could have been on the bench here			0
' but show me a club with a youth academy and i will show you youth coaches who are moaning			0
it 's always the way			0
' when @entity4 revealed he was leaving @entity9 that tumultuous week last may , not everyone at the club was sorry			1
he had little or no relationship with some senior executives , for example , simply because he felt his close bond with @entity120 was sufficient			0
tough times : @entity4 has struggled as manager at @entity29 this season the club 's marketing and commercial staff , meanwhile , were quick to wave goodbye			1
' there were some sighs of relief , that is true , ' said another @entity6 source			0
' he was not easy to deal with			0
the marketing and commercial teams felt he was taciturn and that they could n't rely on his co-operation			0
' he hardly came to the stadium on non-match days and few people ventured down the long corridor to his office at the training ground			0
' the office was right at the end and some felt it was alien territory almost			0
very few executives ever ventured down there without an invite and those invites never came			0
' it was , in a way , classic bunker mentality and most people saw it as strategic			0
' in terms of results on the field it worked , no doubt about it			0
it just did n't make him universally popular			0
' fever pitch : on sunday @entity4 returns with @entity23 to @entity6 at @entity23 there have been similar stories about @entity4 as relationships with some non-football staff have been slow to develop			1
some players remain unsure about their new manager also and it will be interesting to see how many apply themselves as they need to on sunday , given their dreadful season is effectively over			1
at @entity9 , though , there were no such playing issues			2
@entity4 is criticised by some supporters - unfairly you may say - for not winning a trophy while others point to a poor record against the really big @entity77 teams			1
nevertheless , his @entity9 players talk of a driven , intense man who fought their corner for a decade			2
during his time at the club , @entity4 insisted on the best for his players , whether it be training facilities or hotels on pre-season tours			2
he worked his players without mercy in training			0
that 's always been his way			0
some teased friends at @entity23 by text message about the whirlwind of intense labour that was coming their way last summer but there are many who still thank him for the impact he had on their careers and their lives			2
good move : @entity4 has been criticised for his youth policy but @entity107 was among those who came through the ranks at @entity9 @entity240 winger @entity239 , for example , leaned heavily on @entity4 after fathering a daughter with @entity242 in 2004			1
' it 's one of the reasons i respect @entity4 so much , because of how wonderful he was with me at that time , ' said @entity239			1
' on the field he transformed us from a team that finished 17th in the @entity77 one season to a side that finished in the @entity90 places the next , even after @entity252 was sold			2
' you never got negatives from him and i played close enough to him on the touchline to know			0
he can galvanise a squad and get the best out of them			0
he created something special at @entity9			1
' certainly only the myopic would argue with @entity4 ' record at @entity6			2
@entity9 always spent a little more than was made out - @entity37 earned £ 70,000 a week while @entity262 earns £ 60,000 - but @entity4 kept the financial wolf from the door by selling well each summer and , on the whole , buying astutely			1
bunker mentality : @entity4 has a reputation for being difficult to deal with some now question his style of football - revisionism again - but fellow managers do n't			1
one @entity77 boss attended a two - day coaching seminar as a young coach given by @entity4 in 2009 and revealed this week : ' he was the first person i heard talk about false wingers			2
he had @entity277 and @entity278 tucking in and the full backs flying along outside them			0
' it was brilliant and is still hard to play against now			0
it was inventive and attacking			0
' @entity4 was fantastic that weekend , an on - the - grass coach who ran his club methodically and meticulously			2
' @entity9 still owe him now and will for years to come			2
' boost : @entity23 striker @entity252 has been passed fit to face his former club whether @entity4 will feel much love back at @entity6 - where @entity23 have a good record - on sunday afternoon is questionable			1
he deserves a good reception , of course , but football does n't work like that			0
some feel @entity4 should have given @entity120 more notice of his intention to leave			2
as it happened , he knocked on his chairman 's door only once the news leaked from @entity29			0
@entity120 , though , is not bitter about that			0
he remains grateful for the professionalism @entity4 showed in his final days and he knows how the world works			2
many others - as @entity4 will discover on sunday - do not			2
@entity4 returns to @entity9 on sunday , the club where he built his reputation			1
his successor @entity16 has had a good first season at the club but how do their records compare ? in a league of his own at this stage of the season , @entity16 has won more points than @entity4 did last year with @entity9			1
@entity313 @entity4 led @entity9 to fourth place and @entity90 football in 2005			1
it was the first time since 1971 that @entity9 had competed in @entity318 ’s top competition			2
@entity16 remains in a battle to finish fourth			2
top transfers with @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 all coming in , @entity16 has exploited the loan system well this season			2
but @entity4 made some shrewd signings in his time at @entity9 : @entity38 ... ... ... ... ...			1
£ @entity328 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... £ @entity329 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... £ @entity330 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... £ @entity331 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... £ @entity332 ... ... ... ... ...			0
£ 60,000 42.1 % - @entity4 ’ win percentage at @entity9			1
in just 40 games , @entity16 has won 57.5 %			0
that also beats @entity4 ’ record at @entity23 this season — 54 % 66 - @entity16 has won 66 points with @entity9 this season with four games still to play			1
@entity4 ' highest tally was 65 points over an entire season — in 2007 - 08 @entity344 @entity4 was regularly recognised for his outstanding achievements at @entity9			1
he was @entity346 10 times and was @entity348 three times			0
@entity16 has been @entity346 once and was @entity350 in 2007 - 08 .			2

@entity9 under @entity16 already have more points - 66 - than @entity4 managed in a season
some fans remain *unhappy* by @entity4 ' pursuit of @entity9 *duo* @entity37 and @entity38
@entity16 's @entity9 team play better football , according to 92 per cent of those polled on a fan website
some @entity23 players remain unsure about their new manager
@entity4 created something special at @entity9 , says @entity239
