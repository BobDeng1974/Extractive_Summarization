the local circuit court ruled wednesday that the boy , who has not been named because he is a minor , will face the pending criminal charges as if he were two years older			2
the unidentified boy and a 17 - year - old who was a witness to the scene , confessed during a second interview with police			1
victim : @entity17 , 8 , was shot in the back with an arrow when she was playing in her backyard life - saving : the young girl had to undergo a two - and - a - half - hour surgery to treat her injuries ' they basically said that they shot an arrow at a squirrel and the arrow impacted the child and at that point they heard the child scream and obviously at that point they were afraid , ' sheriff @entity25 said at a press conference			1
' you hear a scream and normally , your normal human reaction is to go towards that to see if you can help , not turn on your heels and run away , ' @entity17 's grandmother told @entity44			1
the teen is currently in juvenile custody as the news about the adult sentencing coming today via the @entity49			2
the victim in the unusual crime was @entity17 , an eight - year - old girl who had to undergoe life - saving surgery after the arrow penetrated her lung , spleen , stomach and liver			1
@entity17 's mother said she was too angry to speak with reporters but the girl 's grandmother said she hopes for an apology			1
damage : the arrow went through her left lung , spleen and stomach with the tip coming to a stop in the liver ' for me i 'd like him to come face - to - face to @entity73 and say sorry , ' she said			1
recalling the horrific event at a news conference on may 22 , before the two teens had come forward , @entity17 's mother @entity74 said , ' i screamed			2
' ' @entity80 [ saw ] it , she was on the sidewalk right in front of our house , ' she said			0
during the police investigation , a bow and several arrows were confiscated from a nearby residence			0
those items were sent to a crime lab for analysis			0
‘ we 're leaving all of the evidence open on what could have happened , ’ @entity25 said at the time of their investigation			0
‘ the working theory is a stray arrow , but that could change in a minute			2
' her mother and her mother ’s boyfriend both concurred that it was surely an accident but still wanted the person responsible to come forward so that police can talk with them			0
arrest : a 16 - year - old boy has been arrested after admitting to have mistakenly shot 8 - year - old @entity17 one week ago with an arrow , nearly killing her lucky : @entity110 , seen this week after 2 - 1/2 hours of surgery , is lucky to be alive doctors said ' obviously it was an accident			1
somebody was n’t pin - pointing her , but in town , it ’s wrong to be shooting a bow , ' ms @entity17 told @entity44			1
ms @entity17 's boyfriend echoed the sentiment , saying that they wanted to make sure it does n’t threaten their daughter ’s outdoor playtime			2
' there ’s kids out in the yard all the time			0
there were four girls together and the arrow hit one of them			1
it could have hit any of them , ' @entity133 said			0
the girl was transported to a local hospital and then taken to @entity138 in a @entity140 helicopter			0
' it 's very , very rare to have an arrow injury			0
i 've never seen it before , ’ said her doctor @entity145 , during a news conference shortly after the incident			0
angry : the girl 's mother , @entity74 , seen at a press conference last week , was too angry to comment following the teen 's arrest scene : @entity17 and three of her friends were playing in this yard when she was struck in the back by the arrow the girl is ‘ very lucky to be alive , ’ he said			1
‘ had we changed the trajectory by as little as two centimeters , this could have been a very bad outcome			0
’ @entity17 is also lucky that she had wise parents at the scene , as her mother chose not to remove the arrow before seeing a doctor because she was unsure how deep it went into her daughter ’s body			1
doctors say that was the smart choice , because she could have done more damage by removing the arrow and accidentally tearing some of the girl ’s internal organs on the way out			0
@entity17 is was walking and talking shortly after the incident , but doctors initially was expected to be in the hospital for one to two weeks because she still has an ng tube draining her stomach and a drain running from her lung .			2

16 - year - old boy admitted he was the one who shot an arrow that hit his 8 - year - old neighbor @entity17 in the back
now the boy , whose name has not been released , faces trial as an adult
