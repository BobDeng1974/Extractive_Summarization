by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor senator @entity2 blasted president @entity3 on wednesday for ' 76 instances of lawlessness and other abuses of power , ' in a wide - ranging speech that drew comparisons with @entity10 , lashed out at the administration 's ' obstruction of justice ' on @entity13 and reached its peak with a quote from the cult - classic film ' @entity16			1
' the @entity19 tea party darling recalled hearing @entity3 tell @entity21 host @entity20 during a @entity23 sunday interview that there is ' not a smidgen of corruption ' related to the @entity28 's practice of targeting conservative nonprofit groups because of their political beliefs			1
'' my first thought was of my favorite movie , " @entity16 " , ' @entity2 said of the president 's use of ' smidgen			1
' ' " you keep using that word " , ' he recalled a character @entity40 star @entity39 saying			0
' " i do not think it means what you think it means "			0
' deadly serious , with a smidgen of silly : @entity19 @entity2 sen. @entity2 unveiled his fourth ' abuse of @entity49 ' report on the @entity3 administration at the @entity51 in @entity52 , but could n't help cracking a few jokes in the @entity16 , it was @entity55 ( @entity56 ) saying ' inconceivable ! ' to @entity57 ( r ) ; and with president @entity3 , says @entity2 , it 's ' not a " smidgen " of corruption ' -- to which comes the same reply ' you keep using that word			1
i do not think it means what you think it means ' @entity2 released the fourth edition of his ' abuses of @entity49 ' report during a @entity52 conference hosted by the right - wing @entity74			1
speaking of what he sees as the @entity3 administration 's activism that falls outside the boundaries of federal law , he claimed that ' if the same acts had been committed by @entity10 , every day the headlines in newspapers would be banner headlines			2
' ' and yet , ' he said , ' you do n't have that level of scrutiny			0
' most lawmakers , @entity2 said , claim to be in favor of enforcing federal laws as they are written , but many @entity90 and some news outlets reflexively come to @entity3 's defense because ' he 's on our team			1
' ' there is not presently in the @entity96 an " @entity98 " caucus , ' he fumed , ' but give it time			0
' @entity2 's complaints ran the gamut from the @entity28 , drug laws and immigration reform to offshore drilling , gay marriage and the @entity105			1
@entity2 's speech to the @entity74 covered a wide swath of territory , offering judgments on a variety of what he sees as legal presidential missteps : @entity13 : a recently revealed @entity114 memo said the administration 's ' goal was to declare that whatever happened here , it was not the fault of any policy from this administration			1
in the criminal world , that used to be called obstruction of justice			0
and yet here it 's treated like just another feature of politics			0
' immigration : president @entity3 ' suddenly announced [ that ] some 800,000 people who are here illegally – he was unilaterally granting them amnesty			1
never mind that @entity133 [ of the @entity134 ] gives the president a duty to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed "			0
' gay marriage : @entity2 blasted the president for siding with gay marriage advocates in @entity142 by choosing not to enforce the law , saying that his administration ' decided it 's going to recognize marriages that @entity142 law does n't allow and federal law does n't allow			1
' recess appointments : he complained that @entity3 has gone around the @entity150 to appoint officials by determining on his own when the legislators are in ' recess , ' joking that ' tonight , i 'm pretty confident that a lot of senators are going to go home and go to sleep , ' and the if president has that power he ' can appoint whoever he wants			2
' ' take @entity105 , ' he said at one point			2
' please ! take @entity105 ! ' ' if you wanted to come up with an example of lawlessness , it would be difficult to come up with a better example , ' @entity2 claimed			2
he cited a half - dozen examples of the @entity114 ' illegally ' ignoring the text of the president 's health insurance overhaul law to score political points and keep the new system afloat			1
the administration first offered waivers for certain business groups ' in a blog post by an assistant treasury secretary , put up right around the @entity179 , ' he recalled			0
@entity2 also complained about a secretive meeting between the president and congressional democrats that resulted in broad @entity105 exemptions on @entity185			1
an amendment to the @entity105 , first sponsored by @entity188 @entity187 sen. @entity187 , ensured that members of @entity96 would have to participate in the @entity105 insurance exchanges			0
but @entity2 alleged that the @entity114 ' had a closed door meeting between @entity192 , the @entity90 , and @entity3 , where they suddenly realized " hey , we do n't want to be on @entity105 "			1
' days later , new exemption options emerged for federal lawmakers and their staffs			0
a third episode he cited came after more than 6 million @entity1 lost their medical insurance as @entity105 's implementation loomed in the waning months of 2013			2
' we needed to get together and fix this , ' @entity2 said			0
' we needed to do something to provide relief for those @entity1 we 've hurt			0
' ' the president did n't do that			0
instead he held a press conference ... where he instructed private insurance companies to go ahead and break violate the law , [ saying ] , " by presidential grace and whim , i 'm telling you to do so "			0
' lawgiver : @entity2 said president @entity3 has been ' telling private individuals and private companies to violate the law ' @entity2 lambasted @entity3 on wednesday for ' illegally ' changing federal law to suit him ' we have never had an instance where the president of the @entity223 instructs private citizens and private companies to go ahead and violate the law , ' the senator claimed			1
the @entity114 did not respond to a request for a reply to @entity2 's stinging charges			1
but the senator alleged that ' when you have a president who can pick and choose which laws to follow and which laws to ignore , then you no longer have a president			2
' he also joked about the likelihood that the federal government will soon toss aside some drug laws that tend to earn offenders long sentences			0
' the brownies outside were provided by the state of @entity243 , ' he chuckled , ' so if my remarks today appear in @entity247 , perhaps it will render it more enjoyable			0
' @entity2 , who is expected to run for president in 2016 , told reporters after his speech that he would pledge to be just as hard on future occupants of @entity114 , even if they 're from his own party			1
' whoever the president is – @entity2 or @entity255 , ' he said , ' if he or she disregards the rule of law [ and ] disregards the @entity134 , you can be certain that i will speak out every bit as vigorously against lawlessness by a subsequent president			2
asked if a strict interpretation of laws would also apply to a hypothetical @entity2 administration , he fell silent and then spoke slowly : ' regardless of who the president is			2

the @entity19 senator blasted the @entity114 for ' obstruction of justice ' on @entity13 and ' illegally ' changing laws to suit the president
most of his ire was reserved for the @entity105 : ' take @entity105 , ' he said at one point . ' please ! take @entity105 ! '
@entity2 , a likely presidential *candidate* , *insisted* he will complain about executive *overreach* no matter who occupies the @entity114 next
he released a wide - ranging report wednesday *cataloging* @entity3 's ' abuses ' in office
recalling his assurance that there 's ' not a smidgen ' of corruption in the @entity28 , @entity2 responded by quoting ' my favorite movie , @entity16 '
