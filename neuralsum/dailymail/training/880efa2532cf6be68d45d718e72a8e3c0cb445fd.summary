innovative website @entity0 is creating a new mobile app funded by one of the world 's leading mobile telecommunications companies , the @entity5 , to help combat alcohol problems amongst @entity9 ’s young people			1
@entity2 encourages individuals to take a break from drinking and recreate the drinking culture within @entity9			1
since 2010 , over 32,000 people have signed up to go three months or more without alcohol , and blog about their journey			1
the introduction of the new app is the organisation ’s latest initiative and @entity23 founder and ceo , @entity25 , believes it can help even more those battling the booze			1
dr @entity43 , who is a lecturer in communications at the @entity45 , also felt the app will work as it 'll help promote @entity2 's way of changing individuals ’ alcohol consumption behaviour			1
' when @entity2 builds tools like this mobile app it will get people to interact with their smartphone and use @entity2 ’s programme as a support mechanism for themselves , ' he said			1
' participants currently document their on - going journey on the @entity2 blog , giving advice and support to others			2
' this is where the new app will make a difference , because it ’ll become integrated more in people ’s every - day lives			1
rather than having to sit down and write a blog post people can more easily share with each other			2
' it ’s a much more seamless support network that can be used in everyday life			2
it ’ll always be there when they need it			0
' those currently benefiting most from @entity2 are younger , female drinkers			0
a huge binge drinker from the age of 16 - 29 , @entity77 , knew that she had to make changes in her life			0
she found @entity2 online two years ago and it immediately made a big impact			0
' i used the site for motivation and support			1
i also set myself a goal , which was to make the @entity89 ice hockey team , ' the 31 - year - old said			0
' so i actually used the time not drinking positively , and i made the team			2
from then on my life has completely changed for the better			0
' @entity92 said that the new app would be the perfect way to help young people dealing with alcohol problems			1
one - on - one counselling used in conventional treatment programmes is not for everyone @entity25 meets @entity100 while on his mission to promote the @entity2 programme ' everyone has their phones on them these days so the app would be perfect			2
if you are at a party and feel tempted you only have to get straight on your phone and use the app to seek some support			1
people need to feel supported for change to happen , ' she said			2
four years ago @entity25 , 27 , was working in advertising and drinking heavily			0
but instead of using the likes of @entity118 ( @entity118 ) to get over his problem he decided to not drink for a year and write a blog every week called @entity0 to share his experiences and deal with his issues			1
' it gradually grew a following of people who got encouragement from it and decided it was something they ’d also like to do , ' he explained			0
' it was then i quit my job , set up an @entity133 and developed this free online programme that has grown organically each year to help breed a better drinking culture			0
' the big idea behind it is that one - on - one counselling is not for everyone , so we provide a community - based peer - to - peer process where people can support each other			1
we 've now surpassed aa in terms of the number of people in their programme in @entity9			0
' many young drinkers are too embarrassed to speak with a doctor or a healthcare professional @entity23 has been successful partly because it established a platform technically that ’s very accessible and straightforward for young people			0
it also does n't have the stigma of going to a doctor or a healthcare professional , you can do it privately			0
the other element is that unlike other treatment programmes where people have to say they are an alcoholic or have a drinking problem , @entity2 gets individuals to nominate a goal that has nothing to do with drinking			1
this gives participants something to focus on and a story to tell that does not revolve around alcohol			0
after stopping drinking @entity25 ( left ) set himself other goals to focus on such as keeping fit			0

hello @entity0 site to join forces with @entity5
organisation 's app will encourage people to take a break from drinking
it will help integrate and *reassure* those *struggling* with alcohol problems
you can go straight to your phone when in need of moral support
