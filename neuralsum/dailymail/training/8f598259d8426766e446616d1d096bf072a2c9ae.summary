by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 07:29 est , 27 november 2013 he might look like an extra member of @entity3 , but @entity5 ’s robot humanoid is set to be joining astronauts aboard the @entity7 as early as next year			1
scientists at the @entity9 in @entity10 , just outside @entity11 , have shown off their creation , called @entity13 - 401			1
@entity5 is working on its own version of @entity16 ’s @entity15 , which is already lending a hand on the @entity7 – so the two robots might work together in the future			1
@entity5 's @entity13 - 401robot humanoid could be joining astronauts aboard the @entity7 as early as next year a slightly earlier model called @entity22 is scheduled to be blasted into space in 2014			1
@entity5 ’s robonaut is similar to @entity16 ’s as it is not designed to be completely autonomous but is operated remotely from the ground , @entity25 reported			1
a @entity5 scientist demonstrated how by putting on a pair of specially designed gloves , he is able to control the robot ’s arms and hands , which are based on a human ’s and can perform delicate tasks			1
scientists at the @entity9 in @entity10 , just outside @entity11 , have shown off their creation , which has human - like hands to perform dextrous tasks demanded of astronauts the robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on @entity39 , though it will be able to lift more than that in a zero - gravity environment			1
it is capable of operating inside or outside the space station			0
@entity44 , science directorate deputy head at the @entity45 , said : ‘ it 's to perform operations both aboard the @entity7 and outside			1
‘ scientists ' plans envision introducing robots in manned cosmonautics			0
this is a promising avenue of research for coming years			0
’ a @entity5 scientist demonstrated how he is able to control the robot 's arms and hands by putting on a pair of specially designed gloves the robonaut 's hands are capable of manipulating small items and lifting heavy objects the robot has been built by @entity64 and the company ’s executive director , @entity65 , said : ‘ we have completed r&d for the development of the robot ’s new key assembly unit , which is a " shoulder " with three degrees of freedom			1
‘ we ’re also working on a new pickup and gripping system			0
all this is expected to result in the creation of a prototype of a multifunctional space robot			0
’ he told @entity5 publication @entity79 ( via @entity81 ) there is no need for the robot to have legs and it focuses on a torso and two ‘ manipulator arms ’ as well as a head module			1
@entity16 's @entity88 also has hands , upper body and a head , which has cameras that work like eyes @entity94 is planned to join @entity16 ’s @entity15 2 at the @entity7 , which has also been built to look a little like a person			1
@entity96 2 also has a head , upper body and hands			2
its head has cameras that work like eyes , as well as moving fingers that can manipulate the same tools as astronauts			0
the robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on @entity39 , but this translates into lifting objects that weigh more in space , as the robot is designed to be able to work outside the space station too its upper body can be placed on different lower halves , including a set of wheels			2
the robot works in two ways : it either receives a simple job to do and uses an onboard computer to work out how to perform the task , or can be run by remote control by a person wearing a headset , who can see what the robots sees and then control it from @entity39			1
@entity96 is a humanoid robotic development project conducted by the @entity129 at @entity16 's @entity130 ( @entity130 ) in @entity131 , @entity132			2
it is designed to work alongside astronauts and has dexterous hands to use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts			0
robonaut 2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than the first model , is more compact , more dexterous and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing			0
there are over 350 sensors and 38 powerpc processors in the robot			0
@entity149 members can operate @entity96 , as well as controllers on the ground using ' telepresence , ' which is a set of technologies that allow a person to feel as if they are present at a place other than their true location , using telerobotics			0
the robot does n't have to be fully supervised and can carry out tasks autonomously with supervision checks			0
while not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated , the robot 's hand has 12 degrees of freedom as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist			2
the @entity96 model also uses touch sensors at the tips of its fingers			0
the robot arrived on the @entity7 on august 22 , 2011			2
further upgrades could be added to allow @entity96 to work outside in the vacuum of space , where @entity96 could help space walkers perform repairs , make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments			0
there are over 350 sensors and 38 powerpc processors in the @entity15 robot			2

scientists at the @entity9 near @entity11 have shown off their humanoid robot called @entity13 - 401
the robot can perform delicate tasks with its hands and is operated by a person on @entity39 wearing special gloves
@entity5 is working on its own version of @entity16 ’s @entity15 2 , which is already lending a hand on the @entity7
