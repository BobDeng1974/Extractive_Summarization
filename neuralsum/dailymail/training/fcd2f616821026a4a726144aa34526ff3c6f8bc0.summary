the @entity122 volunteer said part of the reason the hunt to find out about her family had become so desperate was because of a bone condition her children suffer from , which doctors believe could be hereditary			0

i do not blame them for what happened			0
‘ it is getting late , but there is a chance my parents could still be alive			0

i do not want to get older and wish i had done more			0
when my daughter was born , she looked quite a bit like me and i want to know who i look like			2
’ miss @entity6 , who believes she may have @entity157 roots because of her blue eyes , pale complexion and freckles , appealed for anybody who could help to get in touch			1
