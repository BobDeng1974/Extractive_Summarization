in front of a record 45,619 - strong crowd at @entity3 , this was supposed to be a new dawn for @entity6 ’s women as they came up against the second - best side in the world			1
but ultimately their performance bore too much of a resemblance to their male counterparts : promising , but eventually leaving supporters wishing @entity6 could be as good as @entity16			1
@entity18 ’s first - half brace and @entity20 ’s own goal condemned the home side to defeat on their first appearance at the national stadium , but they look to have won over a new generation of supporters , matching @entity16 all over the pitch , if not on the scoreline			1
@entity30 is crowded out by three @entity31 as @entity6 struggled against the world 's second best side @entity18 celebrates scoring her second goal at @entity3 to inflict a heavy defeat on @entity6 @entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity36 6 ; a @entity20 6 ( @entity37 83 ) , @entity38 5.5 ( @entity39 90 ) , @entity40 5.5 , @entity41 5.5 ( @entity42 83 ) ; @entity43 6 ( @entity44 71 , 6 ) ; @entity45 7.5 , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 5.5 ; @entity30 6 ( @entity48 62 , 7 ) , @entity49 5.5 ( @entity50 80 )			1

‘ the attitude ’s there , the character ’s there , the spirit ’s there , ’ head coach @entity83 said			0
‘ 3 - 0 down at half - time , it ’s difficult to come out for the second half and do anything but hang on but the team wanted to keep going forward and i thought we did that well			0
‘ if you want to be competitive at major tournaments you ’re going to have to find a way to beat teams like @entity16			2
the lessons we ’ll learn today are big going forward			0
they punished us when we lost a bit of tactical discipline off the ball			0
’ captain @entity40 felt @entity6 matched the team she sees as the best in the world for long periods			2
‘ we ’ve got to give credit to the @entity31			0
they ’re a world - class team , better than us and we ’ve just got to take that on the chin , ’ she said			0
‘ we ’ve got seven months to go until the @entity111 and we ’ve got to go and try to improve as a team			0
there ’s tactical and technical bits that we can learn as a team but we need to just make sure we need to keep working hard for each other as we can			0
@entity41 holds off @entity67 as @entity6 showed plenty of fight against their talented opponents @entity45 had @entity6 's best chance , hitting the bar after just a few seconds of the game ‘ overall when we reflect on this in a few days ’ time when the emotions have calmed down we will realise that maybe the game was n’t as bad as we thought it was and second half especially we can be really proud of ourselves			1
’ @entity127 midfielder @entity45 came closest for the @entity128 , rattling the bar from 25 yards out inside the opening eight seconds – but then @entity16 took over			1
@entity64 ’s delivery was met at the near post by @entity20 , under pressure from @entity134 , and the ball dropped into the far corner to put the visitors ahead after six minutes – greeted by booing from the @entity3 crowd			1
and five minutes later @entity18 doubled the lead , breaking from her own half to confidently slot the ball under the onrushing @entity36			2
over 45,000 fans turned out to watch @entity6 in the women 's team 's first ever game at the new @entity3 a disappointed @entity6 team acknowledge the bumper crowd after a tough game against the @entity31 @entity6 recollected themselves and thought they had pulled one back with @entity45 ’s looping header caught by the keeper , but goalline technology showed the ball had not crossed the line			1
and @entity158 top scorer @entity18 put the visitors out of sight on the stroke of half - time , nodding in her second from @entity58 ’s cross			2
substitutes @entity165 and @entity166 went close after the break but by that time @entity16 knew the job was as good as done			2
while @entity6 recorded 10 wins from 10 in @entity111 qualifying , this acted as a reminder that they need to improve to beat the best with seven months to go until @entity174 2015 .			0

@entity6 battle hard but lose to @entity16 in front of 45,000 at @entity3
@entity18 scores twice and @entity20 scores own goal
@entity45 had @entity6 's best effort , hitting the crossbar
