cleaning up fallen needles from @entity3 trees is one of the most common reasons consumers do n't buy real trees , the @entity0 has said , but now scientists are on the case			1
scientists in the @entity11 are trying to find ways to make trees less messy and keep them fresh through the holidays			0
keeping a tree well - watered goes a long way toward minimizing the needle problem			1
but beyond that , genetic differences of each tree can also influence how many needles it loses			2
but even within a given species , some trees are better than others , he said			2
needle retention is an inherited trait : if a tree does well , so will the offspring that grow from the seeds in its cones			0
at a research station in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity24 works to identify individual trees that hold onto their needles best			0
cuttings from @entity27 fir trees are suspended in water at a @entity25 research facility in @entity48 , @entity49 needles on a @entity58 fir tree hold drops of water at a @entity25 research facility he tests branches cut early in the fall , which encourages needle loss because they have n't experienced cold weather			1
he lets them dry out and his team evaluates them after about 10 days , looking for branches that do not shed any needles			0
needles start to fall off branches from some trees within three to five days when the branch is gently rubbed , even if they are n't dry and brittle			1
a poor performer may lose all of them within a week			0
if a branch does well , it means the tree has good genetics for keeping needles			2
needles cover the floor under a @entity27 fir tree suspended in a temperature and humidity - controlled room at a @entity25 research facility a needle pops off a @entity27 fir tree after a researcher brushed past it in a temperature and humidity - controlled room at a @entity25 research facility so growers can seek out seeds from those trees to produce seedlings for future planting			1
these progeny should do well , too			0
with a federal grant , @entity24 is also working with others to identify genetic markers that indicate whether a tree will resist needle shedding			0
that would make the tree - screening process much faster and perhaps lead to breeding experiments to produce superior trees			0
trees that experience warm fall months tend to have more needle loss later , @entity24 said			1
so if global warming leads to warmer falls in the future , it could be bad news for @entity3 trees , he said			1
but since his studies focus on tree branches harvested before cold fall weather sets in , they may identify trees that will do well in a warming world , he said			2
@entity24 emphasizes that homeowners can minimize needle shedding by keeping their displayed trees well - supplied with water			1
in fact , when he has set up trees for research in early december and kept them watered , some species , like noble and @entity131 , have gone even three months with only minimal shedding			1
' the potential is phenomenal , ' he said			0
@entity24 , a @entity25 plant pathology professor , displays a cutting from a @entity27 fir tree that 's shedding needles			0

keeping @entity3 trees well watered can minimize the needle problem
certain species of tree lose more needles than others
trees that experience warm fall months tend to have more needle loss later
