' later on that night i figured out my problem was water			2
i did n't have anything to drink			0
so i unscrewed the bolts from the toilet , turned it into a little cup and could reach with one arm , just far enough in — and could put a little cup in the water in the bottom of the toilet bowl			1
' mr @entity5 says he did n't think he would survive the ordeal			1

i ’m going to end up dying of thirst , i ’m going to run out of water and i ’m never going to be found			2
' at the end of the fourth day , mr @entity5 ran out of water because he could n’t reach the lever to flush the toilet but he continued to yell			1

' people say , go get your phone , call an ambulance			0
my phone 's laying on my kitchen table 20 feet away — i ca n't get to it !

that ’s what caused my stroke , ' he said , adding he had all the risk factors for a stroke : high blood pressure , a two - pack - a - day smoking habit and he was overweight			1
