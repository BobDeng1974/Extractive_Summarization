there are few obvious similarities between superstar @entity3 midfielder @entity2 and @entity7 's @entity6 keeper @entity5 but both share the honour of being penalty perfectionists			1
hazard is understandably confident from the spot , having scored 17 goals from 17 attempts in domestic competition for @entity3 and his previous club @entity16 - but @entity18 says @entity5 is the man to stop the @entity19 should he get the chance on saturday at @entity21			1
the former @entity23 keeper has been impenetrable from 12 yards since his move to @entity7 , saving three penalties starting with @entity27 's effort in last season 's opener against @entity3			0
@entity7 goalkeeper @entity5 starred in their 0 - 0 draw with @entity32 after saving a penalty @entity34 could n't beat @entity5 , who has now saved all three @entity36 penalties he 's faced @entity34 reacts after @entity5 was up to the task to save a draw for @entity40 's 18th - placed side since then he 's saved a penalty from @entity43 's @entity42 and last week he was hailed @entity7 's hero as his stop from @entity32 's @entity34 helped @entity40 's side salvage a scoreless draw			1
while @entity2 's record from the dot is impressive , the best in any of @entity50 's top five leagues , he 's faltered in @entity50 and @entity5 's team - mate @entity18 says @entity5 could have his number			2
' he 's a fantastic keeper , ' @entity18 told @entity55 's @entity54 of @entity5 , who joined @entity7 from @entity56			2
@entity2 is deadly from 12 yards , having scored 17 from 17 attempts in domestic competitions hazard has been flawless in leagues for @entity16 and @entity3 , but is yet to take a penalty against @entity7 's @entity5 @entity18 says his keeper has been an inspiration since his move last season from @entity56 it was was not so long ago that @entity5 was the subject of @entity68 international @entity18 's abuse from the @entity70 stands while he was in goal for @entity23			1
@entity18 's no doubt happy to have the 32 - year - old on his side after he famously saved @entity75 's penalty late in the season in 2011 in an undoubted turning point in that year 's @entity6 title that went the way of @entity23			0
' he 's been inspirational since day one ... he works really hard on penalties with our other goalies @entity80 and @entity83 , as well as @entity84 our goalkeeping coach			0
' they all talk through penalties and go through the information about whatever side we 're playing			0
@entity5 really studies up on all that stuff and he 's clearly doing it well , as the stats prove			0

@entity3 's @entity2 has n't *missed* in his 17 @entity36 penalties
@entity7 keeper @entity5 has saved three from three spot - *kicks*
@entity18 said @entity5 has been an inspiration since day one
*leaders* @entity3 host 18th - placed @entity7 on saturday at @entity21
