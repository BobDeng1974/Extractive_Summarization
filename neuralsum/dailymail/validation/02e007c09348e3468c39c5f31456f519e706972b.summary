@entity0 says the opportunity rover has passed the marathon mark for driving on @entity3			1
the space agency said the car sized rover 's odometer checked in at 26.2 miles â€” the distance of a marathon			1
the official time ? eleven years and two months			0
opportunity and its twin spirit landed on @entity3 in january 2004 for what was supposed to be a three - month mission			1
both uncovered geologic signs of ancient water			0
spirit 's mission ended in 2011 not long after it got stuck in @entity3 sand			1
scientists and engineers will celebrate opportunity 's achievement by holding their own marathon relay at the @entity31 , which manages the mission			2
last year , @entity29 broke the record for off - @entity35 distance traveled that was previously held by the @entity39 's @entity38 moon rover			1

' this is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world , ' said @entity51 , opportunity project manager at @entity52 's @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in @entity53 , @entity54			2
' a first time happens only once			0
' the long - lived rover surpassed the marathon mark during a drive of 153 feet ( 46.5 meters )			2
the vehicle surpassed marathon distance of 26.219 miles ( 42.195 kilometers ) with a drive completed on march 24 , 2015 , during the 3,968th @entity3 day , or sol , of @entity29 's work on @entity3 some of the highlights along the route as @entity52 's @entity29 drove as far as a marathon race during the first 11 years and two months after its january 2004 landing in @entity68			1
this jan. 6 , 2015 panorama provided by @entity52 ' was taken by the @entity52 rover opportunity			2
' this mission is n't about setting distance records , of course ; it 's about making scientific discoveries on @entity3 and inspiring future explorers to achieve even more , ' said @entity76 , opportunity principal investigator at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
' still , running a marathon on @entity3 feels pretty cool			2
' opportunity 's original three - month prime mission in 2004 yielded evidence of environments with liquid water soaking the ground and flowing on planet 's surface			1
as the rover continued to operate far beyond expectations for its lifespan , scientists chose the rim of @entity94 as a long - term destination			0
since 2011 , examinations of @entity94 's rim have provided information about ancient wet conditions less acidic , and more favourable for microbial life , than the environment that left clues found earlier in the mission			0
earlier this year an increasing frequency of computer resets has prompted the rover team to make plans to reformat the rover 's flash memory			2
the resets , including a dozen this month , interfere with the rover 's planned science activities , even though recovery from each incident is completed within a day or two			0
' worn - out cells in the flash memory are the leading suspect in causing these resets , ' said @entity51 of @entity52 's @entity31 , @entity53 , @entity54 , project manager for @entity52 's @entity119			0
' the flash reformatting is a low - risk process , as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover			0
' flash memory retains data even when power is off			0
it is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras , among many other uses			0

this map shows the southward path driven by @entity29 from late december 2014 until it passed marathon distance on march 24 , 2015 , during the 3,968th @entity3 day , or sol , of the rover 's work on @entity3 .			1

opportunity and its twin spirit landed on @entity3 in january 2004 , and mission was supposed to last for three - months
last year , @entity29 broke record for off - @entity35 distance traveled beating @entity39 's @entity38 moon rover
