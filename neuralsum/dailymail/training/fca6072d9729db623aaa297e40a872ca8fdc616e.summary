@entity0 confirmed @entity3 target @entity1 was dropped from friday ’s @entity5 defeat against @entity6			1
' he was left out for football reasons ' @entity0 said when asked why the @entity8 had not even made the bench at the @entity10			1
the snub for a player who @entity0 confirmed has asked to leave the club is further proof that relations between player and club have reached the point of no return and will be a source of great encouragement to @entity3 who are weighing up a £ 50million bid for the @entity8 @entity24 star			1
@entity29 were embarrassed by the reaction of the @entity41 on tuesday when @entity1 came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters			1
@entity0 confirmed on friday that the player had turned down the offer of a new deal and asked for a move			2
but @entity1 ’s new deal would only have seen him clear 5million euros and he wants parity with those in the @entity53 capital who are in the second tier of @entity29 ’s wage structure and earn 8million net a season			2
big spenders : real are keen to offload @entity1 following the arrivals of @entity60 and @entity38 supporters who saw him play a huge role in @entity29 ’s @entity65 success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a @entity3 player if they find the money to meet both the asking price and the player ’s wage demands			1
@entity74 are suggesting that @entity74 had made a 60m euro bid for the player but the midfielder @entity77 dismissed the idea @entity1 could do a ‘ reverse @entity79 ’ in moving from between @entity81 ’s big two			0
‘ he ’s a great player but it is very rare that that happens , ’ @entity77 said			0
a fan poll on @entity74 ’s website revealed 80 per cent of @entity87 fans wanting the unlikely swoop to take place			0
and @entity6 coach @entity90 said on tuesday that he is ‘ @entity29 ’s best player ’			2
it seems everyone bar the @entity29 board want the @entity8			0
what remains to be seen is if @entity3 want him enough and can persuade him to give up @entity65 football for a season			0
