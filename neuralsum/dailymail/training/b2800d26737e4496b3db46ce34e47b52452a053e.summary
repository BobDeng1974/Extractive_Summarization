shopping fatigue : two tired female @entity4 fans take a break in one of the beds at the @entity40 store but for shoppers who are genuinely there to shop , such behaviour could be seen as off - putting			2
perhaps the most shocking , and the most recent , of such stories is a grandmother helping her son drop his pants and pee into a bottle , while supporting him standing on one of the shop 's beds			1

when the boy woke up , his grandmother helped him relieve himself by holding up an empty water bottle			0
according to @entity60 , urine dripped onto the new showroom mattress he was standing on			0
the news service said the @entity40 flagship store , which spans 42,000 square metres , is also awash with people picnicking at any available table and chairs , setting up their flasks and food and leaving behind the rubbish			0
where all the cool kids go : visiting @entity4 with no intention of buying has become a trend in @entity40 welcome home : it is not unusual to see people napping , meeting up with friends or having a snack in the display ' rooms ' in @entity40 and it is now renowned for the problem of its sleeping ' customers ' , something one worker in the bed section shrugged off , saying : i think it 's just that shopping behaviour in @entity12 is very different , ' he told the news service			1
the flagship store has to employ extra staff to change the sheets every other day , but business is now booming in the @entity12 market , where its 12 stores pulled in over $ 7.5 billion in the 2012 fiscal year			2
this tolerance towards unruly customers appears to be a global policy			0

in @entity19 , parents have played tennis or got their hair done while kids were dropped off to play at the creche , according to @entity145			1
just hanging : most sofas and beds are occupied as @entity40 citizens go for some @entity150 @entity149 family day out : @entity40 citizens make themselves comfortable in @entity4 's mattress section and in @entity15 the service is often openly used by parents so they can go for lunch or shop elsewhere , said the @entity156			1
some people may be abusing the free services of the furniture company , but while profits are soaring it seems unlikely its customer policy will change			0
