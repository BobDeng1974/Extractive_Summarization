the auto manufacturer has recalled @entity12 - the best - selling car in the @entity14 - as well as @entity15 and @entity16 that were built from 2012 onwards			1
the reason the company gave was that the arachnid 's sticky webs could cause a blockage , which could in turn activate the driver - side airbags as well as cut the cars ' power steering - potentially resulting in a nasty accident			1
the problem lies with the air conditioning condenser unit housing - an area of the car that can get warm and is dark and damp - ideal spider habitat			1
@entity1 explained the spider webs can cause a blockage in a drainage tube that comes from the cars ' air conditioning condenser			1
while the result is not immediately dramatic , the blockage causes water to drip down into the airbag control module , which short circuits and can lead to a worrying warning light to display on the dashboard , or more seriously , cause the airbag to inflate suddenly			2
the company warned that there is even a risk of complete loss of power steering and ' loss of steering assist results in increased steering effort '			0
@entity1 is in the process of notifying owners of the affected vehicles and said its dealers simply need to apply sealant and install a cover to the air conditioning condenser unit housing seam located above the airbag control module , to fix the problem			1
the problem lies with the air conditioning condenser unit housing in threes models of car - an area of the vehicles that can get warm and is dark and damp - ideal spider habitat			1
it is not known if a certain species of spider is to blame one of the models which needs repair is the @entity70 , which is the best selling car in the @entity14 , having already sold 318,990 cars so far this year			2
of the massive number which need fixing , 847,000 are in @entity74 with the remainder in @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78			0
according to @entity1 , there have been no crashes due to the error as yet			2
a @entity1 spokesman told @entity83 the company is aware of three cases of airbags suddenly inflating and 35 cases of warning lights showing			1
the company said that in the cases it has investigated , the cause has been spiderwebs , but they can not confirm that every instance has been created by the troublesome arachnids			0
this is not the first time that spiders have been blamed for car recalls			0
problematic : the auto manufacturer has recalled @entity101 , @entity15 ( pictured ) and @entity16 , as well as their hybrid counterparts , in the @entity14 that were built from 2012 onwards in 2011 , @entity103 recalled 52,000 @entity103 6 sedans because spiders built webs inside a vent for the petrol tank , which could have led to vent blockages and even fires			1
according to @entity114 's blog for @entity115 , the culprit in the @entity103 recall was the tiny yellow sac spider , which is commonly found in gardens			0
the creatures spin tubular webs in which they hide during the daytime and as their silk creations are quite dense and water repellent , they can clog an opening in a vent fairly easily			0
popular : the @entity70 , above , is @entity74 's most popular car			0
almost 319,000 have been sold in the @entity14 this year but its is one of @entity1 's models that have now been recalled @entity1 has already issued two major recalls in recent months , asking for the return of around around 2.2 million vehicles			1
in september , the company called back around 780,000 @entity134 and @entity135 models			0
that was a second recall of the same models after an initial call back in 2012 did not fix problems with the cars suspension systems			0
last month , it also recalled 615,000 @entity143 in the @entity14 after a problem with the gear box was discovered			2
analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers			0
a statement on the car maker 's @entity14 site , said : ' owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail to return their vehicles to a @entity1 dealer for the repair			2

@entity1 has recalled @entity161 , @entity15 and @entity16 in the @entity14 that were built from 2012 onwards
