a couple are being forced to shut their upmarket fireplace shop because of the sound of noisy swingers upstairs			1
@entity5 and @entity6 have had enough of ' embarrassing ' noises coming from the sex club above their @entity10 business in @entity11 , @entity12			1
despite their attempts to drown out the sounds , they claim customers are being driven away by the noises , which start around lunchtime			1
@entity5 and @entity6 ( pictured ) claim it is ' embarrassing ' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs mrs @entity6 said : ' customers are stood here and they 're screaming upstairs			1
i 'm going red , customers are going red and they 're leaving the shop			2
' we 've spent thousands of pounds here and we 're going to have to leave			0
we have so many customers that return to us here			2
' despite their protestations , a representative of the @entity34 swingers club , which has been open for two years , claims they are doing nothing wrong			1
no @entity39 owner , who said she only wanted to known as @entity40 , said she had suggested soundproofing , and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the @entity10 was open			2
she said : ' i 've done everything i possibly can			0
i do n't want them to move			0
i do n't think they like my type of business			1
they knew what it was before they moved in			0
' i 'm very disappointed and quite upset they 're moving			0
i do n't want to interfere with anybody else 's business			1
' problems began for @entity57 and mrs @entity6 when the @entity58 expanded its opening hours into the working day , as well as its late night and early hours opening			2
' it 's more frequent now , they 're open from 1pm onwards , ' said mrs @entity6			1
' we were changing all our days for when they were noisiest			0
' we know what 's going on up there , but we ca n't do anything about it			2
' the club website advertises the first wednesday of every month as ' greedy girl day ' beginning at midday the @entity73 's business @entity10 ( pictured ) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs the couple , who have owned the shop for two years , have complained to @entity77 , but say their only option is to leave			1
mrs @entity6 added : ' we 've made a couple of complaints , but there 's no law for sexual activities			1
it 's two years now just wasted			0
' according to the @entity58 website , daytime activities include ' greedy girl day ' , which takes place on the first wednesday of every month , between noon and 10pm			0
the two businesses share a landlord , @entity92 , who said he has asked @entity58 to take steps improve the situation			2
mr @entity92 said : ' the @entity58 came into the unit five years ago , @entity6 and @entity5 have been there two years			1
there were two other tenants before them and it was n't a problem			0
' now the @entity58 has extended its hours into the working day			0
' i 've heard the noises and it 's not acceptable			1
i 've spoken to the @entity58 about it on numerous occasions on behalf of @entity6 and @entity5 and they 've made no effort to improve the situation			1
if anything it 's got worse			0
' he added : ' i 've written to the @entity58 and , if and when they renew their lease , i 've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day			0
' councillor @entity117 , from @entity77 , said : ' the council has received a complaint about the @entity120 , but as both parties are commercial premises , we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings			0
' we will , however , continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises			0
