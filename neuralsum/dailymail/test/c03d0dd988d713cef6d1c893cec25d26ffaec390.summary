a bedlington lurcher named @entity1 suffered a ' serious hallucinogenic episode ' after accidentally eating a stash of drugs he found at a village bus stop			1
@entity8 , 31 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , said @entity1 was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last monday			1
the four - year - old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop			1
@entity8 , 31 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , said his @entity20 lurcher @entity1 ( pictured ) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last monday @entity1 seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug but after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls @entity1 seemed back to normal following his ' trip '			1
today mr @entity8 , a veterinary surgeon , said : ' we had been taking @entity1 out for a walk as we normally do			1
' we went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree			1
' a few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on , so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area			2
' he came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect			0
' but then he got up and started running around , doing laps of the room as if he was being chased			0
the bus stop in @entity9 , @entity48 , where @entity1 found and consumed the unidentified narcotics after drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal ' he had his tail between his legs and his head down , which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs			1
' when i got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably , producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively			0
' he then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side			0
' my wife was obviously quite upset			0
she 's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before			2
let alone tripping on drugs			2
' i just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client 's dog			0
i took step back and tried to remain calm			0
' because of @entity1 's symptoms mr @entity8 believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic the father - of - one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in @entity78 , @entity10 , to come and take a blood sample and made @entity1 vomit			1
the blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics			0
he added : ' the next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red			0
' i 've got a friend who is a neurologist so i asked them what they thought it was			0
' because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he 'd ingested something hallucinogenic			0
' for a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs			0
@entity1 's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week ' he would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else			1
' it 's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road			2
maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone 's pocket			0
' i have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future			1
' @entity126 , 33 , a farm consultant , added : ' it led to a 45 minute episode in which @entity1 showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics			1
' symptoms include hallucinating , partial seizures , tremors , hyper salivating , in - coordination and collapsing			1
' we want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area			2
' the vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs			2
