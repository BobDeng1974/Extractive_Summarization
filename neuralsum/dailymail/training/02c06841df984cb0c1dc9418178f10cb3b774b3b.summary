@entity7 , 16 , described as ' one of our brightest prospects ' by his headmaster , died after he was wounded in the thigh in @entity13 , east @entity14 , on august 12			1
the teenager , who went to @entity16 in @entity13 , achieved eight grade as in subjects including maths , science , @entity22 literature , geography , religious studies and citizenship ; and three b grades in @entity22 language , humanities and physical education			1
@entity7 , who was murdered in an apparently unprovoked attack , achieved eight grade as and three grade bs in his gcses headteacher @entity33 said : ' one of the careers he was considering was in medicine , and these results would have made that a very real possibility in terms of university entrance			1
' all the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of his murder wanted to know how " good " he was as a student			2
i was able to say without hesitation that he was very able , looking forward to @entity50 results at a very high level and very capable of going on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at any one of our best universities			0
' he said that he had interviewed @entity7 for a place in the school ’s new sixth form a few weeks ago , and that he would remember most ' how hardworking he was as a student , and how very decent he was as a person '			1
mr @entity33 went on : ' some youngsters as able as @entity7 do n’t ever realise their full potential because they are n’t prepared to do what ’s necessary to ensure success			1
some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness at the expense of other , less able students			0
@entity7 ’s approach was the opposite			2
@entity7 was described as ' one of our brightest prospects ' by his headmaster at @entity16 in @entity13 police officers guard the scene where 16 - year - old @entity7 was allegedly stabbed ' he would always have been the last person to boast of his ability			1
he regularly attended the extra classes and revision sessions run by his teachers , even when he probably did n’t need their help any longer			0
his friends could rely on him for help if they needed it , not for arrogance or scorn			0
' the teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in @entity96			0
mr @entity33 went on : ' we are constantly bombarded with negative stories about young people , about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour			2
working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years i have learned the opposite , that the vast majority of young people are in fact very decent , and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults			0
@entity7 's headteacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in @entity96 ' our school , our community , our country has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly shocked and depressed by it			1
the best comfort we can take from it is that , for however a short a time , those of us that knew @entity7 knew a very splendid young man and a fine citizen			2
' three men have been arrested in connection with the alleged offence			0
one , 19 - year - old @entity126 from @entity13 , has been charged with murder and appeared in court on monday			2
the two others have been bailed until a date in september			0
