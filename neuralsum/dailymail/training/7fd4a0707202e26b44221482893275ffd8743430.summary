by @entity0 @entity2 had a rare moment of bonding with @entity5 over his passion for saving @entity8 tigers , she writes in her new memoir published today			1
the former @entity11 secretary of state said that she was able to get the @entity13 president to shed his tough guy image by appealing to the animal lover inside of him			1
he took her to his private office and gave her a lengthy lecture and even invited her husband @entity21 to tag polar bears in the wilderness with him			1
anecdotes : @entity26 ( at a book signing today ) shared the stories of the world leaders she met during her time as secretary of state @entity26 also inspired @entity5 to reveal a never - before - heard anecdote about how his mother was mistaken for a dead body and nearly taken away for burial when she was really just sick and unconscious			1
she talks about both episodes in her book , ‘ @entity39 ’ , which was released today after being highly anticipated in @entity38			2
the memoir and barrage of interviews @entity26 has given is being seen as the first step in her potential run for the @entity46 in 2016			2
@entity39 covers the major events of her time as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013 including the @entity50 , the attack on the @entity11 embassy in @entity52 and attempts to find peace in the @entity55			1
but it also includes offbeat anecdotes about relations between @entity11 and @entity13 , which were ‘ reset ’ by president @entity65 in 2009 but fell apart by @entity13 ’s use of energy as a tool of foreign policy and its annexation of @entity63 earlier this year			1

but in meeting at his dacha , or holiday home , outside @entity73 the two had a rare moment of solidarity			0
@entity26 knew that one of his passions was wildlife conservation so asked him out of the blue : ‘ tell me what you are doing to save the tigers in @entity83 ’			2

now i had his attention ’			0

‘ as he drew nearer , he saw a woman ’s legs wearing shoes that he recognised as his wife ’s			0
he ran up and demanded his wife ’s body			0
‘ after an argument the man gave in , and @entity5 ’s father took his in his arms and , after examining her , realised she was still alive			1

@entity5 was responding to @entity26 's comments that he was behaving like @entity158 by sending @entity13 troops into @entity160			1
in 2010 thousands of secret diplomatic cables sent by the @entity11 were published by @entity162 , revealing embarrassing details of what they really thought about world leaders			0

in the cables @entity11 diplomats accused him of having a ‘ penchant for partying hard meant that he never got sufficient rest ’			0
he is also branded ‘ feckless , vain , and ineffective as a modern @entity186 leader			0
’ a wounded @entity173 , who had suffered his own public indignities over his notorious ‘ @entity189 ’ parties , told @entity26 : ‘ why are you saying these things about me ? ‘ @entity11 has no better friend , you know me , i know your family ’			2
at his request @entity26 made a speech in front of tv cameras about the importance of relations between the two countries to smooth things over			2
shock : @entity26 said that @entity5 surprised her with the grisly tale of how his sick mother was nearly mistaken as being dead eight years before he was born she writes : ‘ no one wished these words had stayed secret more than i did ’			1
@entity26 spent two thousand hours on board her @entity210 757 whilst travelling the globe as part of her job , the equivalent of 87 full days			0
she describes how the air stewardesses used to buy local foods wherever they went such as smoked salmon from @entity219 , but the ‘ @entity222 ’s famous turkey taco sandwich ’ was always a favourite			1
on the long flights the journalists , staff and crew on board amused themselves by celebrating birthdays that took place mid-trip and watching weepy romantic comedies			0
they also never grew tired of the yellow pyjamas worn by @entity232 , the former special advisor on @entity234 and @entity235 , @entity26 writes			0
on one occasion they were watching @entity238 , a 2007 historical drama about an @entity241 agent who spied for the @entity13 in the 1980s and 90s			0

the world does n’t need any more @entity252 ’			0
elsewhere @entity26 says that when she was on the road she was warned to leave her @entity255 on her plane and take the battery out to stop it being compromised			0
