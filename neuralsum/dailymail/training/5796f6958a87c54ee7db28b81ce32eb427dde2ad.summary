by @entity0 measuring 40ft high and riddled with rats and flies , this is the scene that greets residents of one suburban road every single morning			1
made up of compacted rubbish , this mountain is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste , old shoes and broken fridges to tyres , scrap metal , excrement , discarded nappies and plastic bottles			1
it has blighted the lives of residents living in @entity21 in @entity22 , south - east @entity23 for nearly five years – and shows no sign of being moved , despite the fact it set on fire again this week for the umpteenth time			1
on top of that , he is forced to watch it smoulder away constantly as it continues to self - ignite in the warm summer heat			2
‘ the fire brigade have been here all day and night and they could be here all weekend , it ’s a top priority fire risk , ’ he said			0
in fact , since 2011 , @entity66 has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site			2
this represents more than 2,250 working hours and more than £ 650,000 in fire - fighting resources			2
‘ it ’s costing the taxpayer a lot of money , ’ said mr @entity49			0
‘ it ’s a hazard because it keeps catching alight and the fire service has to come out constantly to check on it			0
‘ the trouble is it keeps self - igniting in the heat and it just sits there smouldering away			0
’ the mountain of garbage has been a massive problem for mr @entity49 and his neighbours since rubbish disposal company @entity89 took over the site in 2011			1
since 2011 , @entity66 has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site - at a cost of more than £ 650,000 in resources the mountain is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste , old shoes and broken fridges to tyres , scrap metal , excrement and discarded nappies firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis and repeatedly hose it down to ensure the smouldering rubbish tip does n’t escalate into a full - blown fire according to its website , the firm ’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it ‘ specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity			1
’ it charges people to dump rubbish at the site — day and night , which it sorts , treats and then sends on for disposal elsewhere			1
however , residents say this does n’t happen and instead , over the past couple of years , @entity89 has just taken the money and let it stack up in a monstrous putrid mountain			2
‘ it ’s an absolute nightmare ’ , said mr @entity49			0
‘ this used to be a quiet little @entity132 , lovely and green and a pleasure to live in but now there ’s a nasty smell as soon as you open the front door , flies and rats			0
‘ we ’re living here under terrible conditions			0
we ’re stuck with this huge problem and nobody wants to take any notice or do anything about it			0
‘ we need someone to come and ship it all out , but no one seems to be stepping up to do the job			0
’ mr @entity49 reckons it will cost £ 2million and require a fleet of lorries to shift the 25,000 tonne of rubbish			0
however , an ongoing dispute between @entity89 , the @entity157 and the @entity158 means the rubbish is unlikely to be moved any time soon			1
firefighters and officers are required to visit the south - east @entity23 site three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and carry out security checks the rubbish has attracted rats to the area and is plagued by flies meaning residents can not open their windows , relax in their gardens or keep their cars clean of dust the location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority , which in this case is @entity182			1
but its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the @entity157 , which allows @entity89 to use the site ‘ as a waste transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste , from commercial operators with [ a maximum ] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time			1
’ last november , the agency won a court order for @entity89 to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of april			1
but the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week			1
it ended up failing to comply with the order			0
the @entity157 then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company , former company director @entity209 , new company director @entity210 and site manager @entity211			1
the charges were in relation to @entity89 not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site			1
however , earlier this month the @entity158 dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal			2
an @entity157 spokesman said : ‘ we fully understand and share the frustration of local residents and are doing everything we can to deal with the problems that @entity89 have created			1
@entity49 , 74 , who has lived on the road for 50 years , is forced to live with the putrid stench of rotting litter , the foot - long rats which roam freely and the plague of flies ‘ we ’ve used a range of approaches to make @entity89 clean up the site			1
the site operators have avoided their responsibilities over many months and failed to comply with notices and a mandatory court order to remove the waste by 1 may 2014			2
‘ waste crime blights people 's lives			0
we will not give up			0
’ the @entity158 recognised that those responsible have broken the law , but decided not to send them to prison			2
we ’ll read the judgment carefully before deciding whether to appeal against that decision			0
‘ since the hearing we ’ve already served a further enforcement notice to stop @entity251 from bringing any further waste on to the site and this appears to be working			2
‘ we are also considering what further steps we can take to make the operators remove the waste			0
‘ it is the operator ’s and then the landowner ’s responsibility to clear up the site			0
it is not the responsibility of public bodies unless there is an immediate risk to the public			0
‘ our environment officers are visiting the site regularly and we will continue that close scrutiny working in partnership with the @entity273 and @entity274 to work to find a solution			0
’ the new enforcement notice means that any person depositing waste at @entity89 will be committing an offence and may face further action from the @entity157			1
the @entity157 has issued an enforcement notice to site owners @entity89 to stop the firm dumping any more waste at the already overcrowded site earlier this month , the @entity158 dismissed a case against @entity89 which had been brought by the @entity157 which was seeking contempt charges failure to comply with the new enforcement notice will result in further regulatory action being taken and several conditions within the new enforcement notice need to be met before further waste can be accepted at the site			1
@entity294 , environment agency area manager for @entity296 and @entity23 , said : ‘ this enforcement notice is another step towards the @entity157 bringing the @entity89 site back into compliance			1
‘ the @entity301 we secured last year has not been complied with , and waste on site is slowly increasing			2
‘ we understand the frustration of local residents and are doing everything within our power to bring the site back into compliance as soon as possible			0
’ in the meantime , firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis to ensure the smouldering tip does n’t escalate to a full - blown landfill fire			1
in addition , officers are required to visit three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and make security checks			0
@entity324 has been unable to contact @entity89 representatives for comment .			2

the 40ft high pile of rubbish , which is also 60ft wide , towers above a residential street in @entity22 , south - east @entity23
@entity333 is full of all types of rubbish imaginable from rotting industrial waste and scrap metal to excrement and tyres
