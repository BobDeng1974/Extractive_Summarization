' i felt like the chemo was killing me and i had nothing to lose			2
i could n't accept i was going to die			0
' after going online to research his options , he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it			1
' i pay around £ 50 for a gram from a bloke i know who makes it , ' he said			1

' despite this , some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts			2
' researchers are collecting patients ' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not , although this is weak evidence compared to properly - run clinical trials			0
