how brave is @entity0 ? he ’s seemingly immune from the sack at @entity2 so he ’s under no pressure in his job whatsoever			1
so when does this manager show courage in his work ? having faith in @entity8 at the start of this season ? was that brave ? no , it was just bad management			0
so after three draws and a scrappy win , @entity2 find themselves a point ahead of @entity16 in the early table			1
for a manager who has no pressure of the sack , 18 years at the helm , and money to spend , @entity0 better pull his finger out soon			2
but is he brave enough to make big decisions ? @entity25 has become a lazy player for @entity2 yet his place in the starting line - up seems secure @entity0 seems incapable of dropping his £ 42m midfielder despite his poor level of performance @entity25 rues his penalty miss in @entity2 's @entity33 last 16 tie with @entity35 last season has @entity0 been cruising along like a lottery winner , safe in the knowledge he does n't have to do anything extra special to keep his job ? fourth place will do apparently			1
and @entity2 do n’t even have to make it to the quarter - finals of the @entity33 these days			2
@entity0 has the safest job in football			2
he has starved a club of success to the point where the fans now believe the @entity49 is the definition of success for a big club			0
i guess what i ’m really asking is this : has @entity0 got the bottle to drop @entity25 ? he ’s paid £ 42million for a skilful footballer , but one who was always keen on clocking off mid-season			1
bringing him to the @entity60 where there is no winter break was always risky			0
@entity25 smiles in training ahead of @entity2 's @entity33 trip to @entity65 on tuesday despite his lazy performances , there seems no danger of @entity25 being relegated to the subs ' bench as in this match at @entity72 last season but @entity25 is being carried in the @entity2 team , just as his @entity76 colleagues carried him for most of the @entity77			1
he picked up a winner ’s medal in @entity80 by default			0
@entity2 ’s full - backs go forward , they need protection			2
there ’s more chance of @entity86 refusing to talk about himself than there is of @entity25 tracking back			2
his mid-season lull now lasts from august to may , with the odd glimpse of brilliance			1
and in some ways i feel sorry for him			0
was he ever cut out for the speed and passion of the @entity60 ? signing @entity25 is simple , recognising that he is n’t the player you need would have been brilliant insight			0
@entity25 showed only occasional glimpses of his brilliance last season @entity104 , by contrast , has been in excellent form so far this season and scored against @entity106 so as @entity0 has dithered about making big signings and spending money in the past , now he is becoming a specialist in dithering over team selection			1
@entity25 seems undroppable , even when his contribution to the @entity2 team cause is minimal			1
i suspect it ’s because @entity0 refuses to see what the rest of us can all see ( nothing new there then ! )			0
while @entity25 strolls around , @entity104 puts a shift in – with more quality than the @entity76 as well			1
the contrast between the two is breathtaking			0
meantime others watch from the bench wondering why they are being left out in favour of a talented but lazy footballer			0
it ’s because @entity0 spent a fortune on him , and he has n’t got the balls to drop him .			0

@entity25 produces lazy performances on a regular basis for @entity2
the @entity76 is *notorious* for fading during the second half of the season
but now @entity25 's lull lasts from august until may
@entity0 does n't have the bottle to take the £ 42m out the side
@entity104 , by contrast , works hard and has more quality
