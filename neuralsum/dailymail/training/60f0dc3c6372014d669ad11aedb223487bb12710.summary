by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 11 august 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 11 august 2012 a 13 - year - old who scrimped and saved to buy a hot dog stand to help his struggling family is now in a homeless shelter after his city shut his cart down over a permit violation			1
previously living with two parents who are both disabled and unemployed , @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity8 said he hoped his summer business would help his family make ends meet , no matter how small			1
it was only after claimed misguidance from a city official on what permits he 'd need , he failed			1
speaking of her husband , @entity10 's step - father @entity29 , who has multiple sclerosis , she said their family in result of the transition are no longer together either			1
' @entity29 ca n't stay with us because he takes prescription narcotics to deal with his pain and the shelter does not allow him with those kinds of drugs , ' she said			0
together the family receives about $ 1,300 a month in disability payments , a meagre sum with mr @entity29 recently losing his job			0
stepping up to the plate , the 13 - year old said he used his savings to purchase the hot dog stand after doing a great deal of research on what could be most successful for business according to the economy and the area			2
misguided : @entity10 said he spoke with a woman at city hall to ask about required permits needed for business and was told he did n't need one , which was wrong ' i 'm just trying to bring in some money for them and the household as they 're struggling , ' he told @entity28			1
he also researched what , if any , permits he 'd need			0
' we went and we talked with @entity66 from city hall ... and asked her do we need like a business permit , a license ? and she said no , ' his mother told @entity28			1
no more than 10 minutes after setting up shop outside a sporting goods store who granted the boy permission , city officials caught sight of his stand and asked about that permit			1
not having one , they told him he 'd have to close up shop right away			0
law : while on private property in a store 's parking lot of a store that permitted his business , the city outlaws food carts downtown without a permit as they distract from restaurants who pay taxes ' i thought , wow , i 'm getting shut down all ready and i have n't even started , ' @entity10 said			1
according to @entity96 , the stand was within the city 's downtown commercial zone where food carts not affiliated with restaurants are not permitted			2
city of @entity11 assistant manager @entity102 said that the rule was established as a protection to restaurants in the area who pay property costs , unlike food carts			0
' this is a great opportunity for him , and it would be great to work with him and we can in many commercial areas of the city			0
this just happens to be one where he ca n't , ' mr @entity102 told @entity28 last week			2
moves : @entity10 sold his cart but as luck would have it to a man who allowed him to keep it for use , though that did n't stop his family from moving to a homeless shelter changing his hot dog stand 's sign to ' for sale ' @entity10 has since sold his cart , but not exactly at a loss			1
@entity96 reports a local businessman having purchased the cart while allowing him to keep it for his use , entirely for free			0
@entity10 has since taken the cart to private events			0
not without new challenges , however , his next he said is the health department : each event he works he says he has to purchase a new permit from them			0
@entity10 said it 's difficult for him to turn any kind of profit with all of the extra costs			2
