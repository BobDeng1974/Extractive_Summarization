by @entity0 @entity2 mayor @entity1 today claimed that rehab saved his life as he returned to work following nearly two months in rehab			1
the beleaguered politician , 45 , looked decidedly slimmer at the press conference as he apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use , and said he took full responsibility for his actions			1
' like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse , i was in complete denial , ' he said at the press conference at @entity18			1
' but soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor			1
' after experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life , i decided that enough was enough			2
i had become my own worst enemy			1
' i now know that the staff at @entity40 saved my life , ' he said			0
' thanks to my treatment i can proudly say today that i have begun the process of taking control of my life			2
' he continued : ' but folks , this is a long long road to recovery			1
no matter what i do , i will never be able to change the mistakes that i have made in the past			0
' when i look back on some of the things i have said and some of the things i did when i was using , i am ashamed , embarrassed and humiliated			0
i was wrong and i have no one but no one to blame but myself			0
i want to sincerely apologize			0
' echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re-election in november , @entity1 vowed to serve @entity2 for ' many , many years '			0
back to work : @entity2 mayor @entity1 arrives at @entity18 on monday after nearly 2 months in rehab exclusive event : media relations officer @entity68 ( center ) organizes the select media outlets who are permitted into @entity74 's news conference after he arrived at @entity18 in @entity2 although he thanked his family , he did not mention his long - suffering wife @entity76 by name in the speech			1
@entity1 @entity1 , who said he will continue to undergo treatment , spoke shakily throughout the appearance and would not take any questions before he left the room			2
he had entered the @entity84 facility in @entity42 on may 1 to be treated for alcohol addition after announcing in april that he was seeking treatment			1
he made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack ; @entity1 admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a ' drunken stupor , ' following months of denials			1
he held monday 's press conference in his protocol office - a space that holds just 25 people - so only certain publications were invited , @entity74 â€™s communications director @entity68 told the @entity99			1
unhealthier days : @entity74 is pictured in november last year ; he looked decidedly slimmer at monday 's press conference and said he had been working with personal trainers while in rehab the venue meant that reporters from the national wire service @entity107 , @entity103 and @entity104 are not welcome - and even the president of the city hall press gallery			1
the decision allowed for yet another chapter in @entity74 's rocky relationship with the media			1
@entity115 spokesperson @entity114 said the member 's lounge , which is available , would have been more appropriate because it allows for more people			2
' from a city point of view , this is not reflective of the approach or the collaborative relationships we have and value with members of the media , particularly our colleagues in the city hall press gallery , ' she said			1
@entity127 , a @entity103 reporter who was left off the invite list , told the @entity129 he felt ' shock , anger , frustration and momentarily , disbelief ' to have been left of the list			0
out and about : @entity2 mayor @entity1 spent his final saturday before returning to work shopping in @entity136 , @entity42 , where he posed for photos			0
he has been in rehab since the start of may ' the decision to hold it in the protocol lounge is an entirely arbitrary one that offers no tangible benefit to the mayor or his staff , ' he said			2
@entity145 , president of the city hall press gallery and a reporter for the @entity104 , said the mayor has often limited the media 's access , but never to news conferences			1
' i feel the mayor should be facing all the @entity2 media that are interested in hearing him , ' he said			2
@entity74 previously announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on july 1 - @entity155			1
speaking to the @entity129 , he said : ' i will be back , i guarantee you			0
i am coming back and you will see a different @entity1			0
' he said he felt ' great ' and was benefiting from the self - imposed exile			2
treatment : @entity74 had entered the @entity84 facility in @entity42 , pictured , in may and likened the experience to going to football camp as a youngster ' it reminds me of football camp			1
kind of like the @entity167 camp i went to as a kid , ' he said , adding ' i am working out every day and i am learning about myself , my past and things like that			0
' but he said he was missing his family ; the only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to @entity178 's on his birthday , and he added that he was anxious to get back to them			0
on the subject of his addiction , he acknowledged that it was his own fault			2
he said : ' no one has enabled me			0
we were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting			0
you do booze or drugs because you want to do it			0
i have learned my lesson			0

@entity74 entered rehab for alcohol addiction treatment on may 1 after ' another video *emerged* showing him smoking crack '
in a press conference on monday , he said he had been ' in complete denial ' but soon realized he had ' become my own worst enemy '
he said he received world - class treatment and is on the road to recovery
before the press conference , he angered media by picking a venue for just 25 people , meaning that some news publications were not invited
