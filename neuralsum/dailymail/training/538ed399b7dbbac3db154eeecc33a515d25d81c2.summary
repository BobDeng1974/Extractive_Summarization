a century on , the four seasons bring constant changes to the scarred landscapes and ruins of the @entity5 battlefields in @entity6 and northern @entity7			1
@entity8 has its red poppies ; summer its sun - kissed green foliage ; autumn stuns with vibrant colours ; and winter brings the bleakness of rain and mud			2
soldiers of the 1914 - 1918 @entity5 had precious little time to appreciate the colour			2
instead they endured the mud as relentless shelling destroyed woods and villages and created desolate , treeless landscapes , while many cities were reduced to heaps of rubble			0
one hundred years and the force of nature have slowly changed those haunted places , yet many of the relics still exist , both above and below the surface			0
some bunkers have turned into stables ; shell craters became drinking ponds for cattle			1
many trenches and tunnels remained largely untouched on what was known as the @entity41 , a battle line stretching from @entity6 to the @entity44 border			1
each season offers a different view to the relic hunter			0
a road that seems to yield nothing in summer due to heavy foliage unveils a trove of treasures in the desolate winter			0
the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity6 , is one of the best preserved on the @entity55 , and the line of bunkers on @entity58 in @entity7 give the viewer an idea of how important high ground was in @entity5			1
the fort was built in 1878 as part of the fortifications around the city of @entity70			0
after heavy shelling during @entity5 in 1914 , the fort surrendered and under the rubble still lie the bodies of @entity6 soldiers a wooden cross with a poppy is left at a bomb crater named the ' @entity79 ' in @entity80 , @entity6			1
the crater was created by the largest of 19 mine explosions detonated to signal the start of the @entity85 phase of the @entity86			0
the explosion was set off on june 7 , 1917 underneath one of the then highest @entity90 front - line positions on @entity91			2
the blasts were reportedly heard as far away as @entity93 the @entity53 bunker in @entity54 , @entity6			1
it is sometimes referred to as the ' @entity96 ' due to its shape			0
the bunker was constructed by the @entity99 and later conquered by the @entity7 two @entity90 bunkers on farmland in @entity102 , @entity6			1
one hundred years after the guns went silent , thousands of bunkers still exist along what was the @entity41 which stretched from @entity6 to the @entity44 border			1
many are protected by local historical authorities while many others decay slowly @entity110 bunkers in @entity111 , @entity6			1
the bunkers were originally constructed by the @entity113			2
their location was close to the front line with trenches running both in front of and behind the bunkers the @entity121 bunker is situated in @entity122 , @entity6			1
one of four @entity113 concrete shelters built into the hill , it was constructed in 1917			0
the shelters were captured by the @entity99 in 1918 @entity113 trenches are preserved at @entity128 , @entity129 in @entity55 , @entity6			1
the farmer who owned the site was required to leave his land in 1914 when the war began			0
after returning to reclaim the land , much was cleared away , but he continued to maintain part of the trench the remains of the @entity138 , in @entity139 , @entity6			1
the chateau , due to its high position , served as an observation post for the @entity113 artillery but soon afterwards was destroyed by @entity90 artillery			0
the cellars would serve as a shelter for a great part of the war and @entity150 soldiers soon nicknamed it ' @entity151 ' , after the name of the owner a @entity90 commando bunker next to a house in @entity156 , @entity6			1
this bunker has been a listed monument since 1999 a bomb crater from @entity5 named ' @entity160 ' is surrounded by a fence and trees in @entity163 , @entity6			1
the crater is a result of one of several explosions under the @entity90 front line an artillery shell lies at the opening of a bunker near @entity172 , @entity7			1
fifteen @entity113 wwi soldiers were re-buried at nearby @entity175 cemetery in @entity176 , @entity7 on oct 22 , 2014 , nearly a century after they died in battle			2
the soldiers , who served with the @entity180 , were discovered in a field five years ago in @entity172 and identified through a variety of means , including dna the remains of the @entity90 @entity187 gun pit in @entity188 , @entity6			2
it was originally designed to be a naval gun , but was later adapted as a railroad gun which was capable of long range a @entity90 - built bunker next to the roadside in @entity195 , @entity7			0
the bunker was named @entity197 ( the three houses )			0
@entity195 was occupied by the @entity90 from october 1914 and was part of the battleground of what is known as the ' @entity202 '			0
this ' race ' saw reciprocal attempts by the @entity206 - @entity113 and @entity90 armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army through @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 - rather than an attempt to advance northwards to the sea the remains of a @entity90 bunker ( left ) at the @entity217 @entity216 in @entity218 , @entity7			0
the park is situated on what would have been the @entity90 defensive line during battles in 1916 against @entity217 forces			2
right , a bunker on @entity58 near @entity225 , @entity7			0
@entity58 offered @entity90 troops as of oct 1914 a strategic advantage by being located on the high ground near the @entity229 a large @entity90 - built bunker in the centre of a farm field on @entity58 a @entity90 - built bunker ( left ) next to a farm building in @entity235 , @entity6			2
local archaeologists have recently discovered @entity6 and @entity7 trenches in the area , which was bitterly fought over during the war and was also the site of one of the first poison gas attacks			1
right , a bunker is covered in overgrowth in @entity218 the @entity113 bunker at @entity246 in @entity55 , @entity6			1
the section was given this name due to the frequent shelling by the @entity99 a bunker next to a muddy field ( left ) in @entity195 , @entity7			0
right , the @entity113 @entity253 bunker in @entity139 , @entity6			2
it was used to treat casualties running up to the @entity91			0
part of the bunker today is used as a house for birds a @entity90 trench at the @entity261 site in @entity262 , @entity6			2
the area was instrumental for the @entity99 in the assault on @entity91			0
the trench was restored in 1998 after being abandoned for nearly 100 years and is based on an actual @entity90 trench that existed on the site sugar beet is piled high in front of a @entity90 bunker on farmland in @entity272 , @entity6 a bunker next to a modern house in @entity275 , @entity6			2
many @entity5 and @entity277 bunkers in @entity6 are protected by the heritage association and can not be removed from the land horses eat in a pasture surrounding a @entity90 - built bunker in @entity283 , @entity6 a @entity113 bunker between two newly planted trees in @entity262 , @entity6 a @entity90 machine - gun post bunker ( left ) in a field in @entity288 , @entity6			1
right , a @entity90 bunker on a farm , also in @entity288			0
the bunker , an above ground structure , was located just behind the @entity90 front line a @entity90 - built bunker at the end of a reconstructed trench at the @entity261 site in @entity262 , @entity6 the @entity41 circa 1916 : @entity113 infantrymen occupy a shallow trench in a ruined landscape before an advance some 7.5million men lost their lives on the @entity41 during @entity5			1
the front was opened when the @entity99 invaded @entity305 and @entity6 in 1914 and then moved into the industrial regions in northern @entity7			2
in september of that year , this advance was halted , and slightly reversed , at the @entity308			0
it was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the @entity314 to the @entity44 border with @entity7			1
this line of tunnels remained unaltered , give or take a mile , for most of the four - year conflict			1
by 1917 , after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side , new military technology including poison gas , tanks and planes was deployed on the front			0
thanks to these techniques , the @entity330 slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war 's end in november			0
but the scars will forever remain			0
@entity113 soldiers wounded in the trenches on the @entity41 during the @entity5 make their way back from the front line			1

some bunkers have turned into stables , while shell craters became drinking ponds for cattle
many trenches and tunnels remained untouched on the @entity41 , a battle line stretching from @entity6 to the @entity44 border
the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity6 , is one of the best preserved on the @entity55
