when @entity2 's boyfriend @entity1 proposed to her it was , she says , more like ' being asked out for pizza '			1
so disappointing was this pivotal life moment that @entity2 decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again			1
so the 34 - year - old from @entity10 , @entity11 , made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question , founding @entity17 , @entity19 ' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service			1
on bended knee : @entity2 , 34 , right , launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend @entity1 , left , offered her such a disappointing one catering for clients with any budget - from £ 10 to £ 10,000 - @entity2 has already helped couples all over the @entity27 get engaged , and boasts a 100 per cent success rate			1
she said : ' the idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend , @entity32 , proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they 'd like to go for a pizza			1
' when he proposed i did n't even realise what he was asking			0
he said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out			0
' at the time i thought it was because he did n't care enough to put any effort into it , but once he explained i realised i was being silly			0
he said he wants to have another go , so now i 'm just waiting			0
' you have got to be kidding : @entity2 does n't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend 's finally pop the question she said : ' i want to help other people not to feel how i felt			1
initially , i felt like he could n't really care about me to have asked that way , though of course i know that 's not true at all			2
' @entity2 spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose			1
the client can choose from a number of packages , ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under £ 100 , to a full proposal planning service , where @entity2 organises every aspect of the proposal , including negotiating a discount with venues and vendors and handling payments			1
@entity2 added : ' i ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh , how they spend their saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture			1
' once we 've got the idea , the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like			0
' be mine ? @entity1 and @entity2 have been together for four years , but @entity1 says he is planning to propose all over again because @entity2 was so disappointed by his first attempt clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi - style lens			1
@entity2 said : ' a lot of guys use @entity91 for ideas and end up with something generic			2
they can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it			0
' a good proposal can be lasting talking point , but a bad one can end up on @entity99 for the whole world to see			2
' i have n't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided			0
' say cheese ! @entity2 caters for clients with any budget , from £ 10 to £ 10,000 , and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their ' proposal package ' @entity2 's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee , and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail - safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple			1
@entity2 , whose background is in marketing and teaching @entity122 , believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become @entity17			2
she said : ' a lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick			0
' i know that they need help with this sort of thing and i 'm here to give it to them			0
i can give them a female 's perspective and they do n't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out			2
meet the expert : ' this is a huge industry in @entity150 and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner			0
their fiances usually love that they 've used one too ' @entity2 admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride - to - be that they 've used her services , but she believes that will change			1
