by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 02:24 est , 14 august 2013 the feud between @entity2 and his neighbour has dragged on for 17 years			1
and with the row being over the increasing height of @entity7 ’s conifer trees , mr @entity2 has been on the losing side ... until now			1
after years of complaining that the trees , as high as 20ft , blocked out the sunlight and harboured flies that would fly into his house , officials have finally come down on mr @entity2 ’s side and ordered that mr @entity7 ’s ‘ personal forest ’ in @entity17 , @entity18 , must be cut down			1
personal forest : @entity2 has blamed his neighbour for allowing the conifers to grow so high they block out his light gloomy : mr @entity2 stares out from one of the upstairs rooms , which has been in the shadow of his neighbour 's conifers for years mr @entity2 , 55 , said : ‘ it is quite ridiculous			1
my wife and i feel like prisoners in our own home			2
' we can not open the windows as there are too many bugs and we do n’t get any natural light in our living room			0
’ he said the row began in 1996 when he spoke to his neighbour about uprooting a hedge and building a wall to separate the two properties			1
mr @entity2 said mr @entity7 agreed , but then planted eight large conifer trees			2
‘ i was gobsmacked ' , said the ex-miner , 55			0
‘ it is was if he did it out of spite for getting rid of the hedge			0
’ two years ago the @entity50 noticed cracks appearing in their wall and took legal action			0
overshadowed : the grandfather from @entity17 in @entity18 demonstrates how high the trees are feud : the dispute first started back in 1996 when mr @entity2 made a gift of two miniature conifers to his neighbour when a local newspaper contacted mr @entity7 ’s home , his son @entity61 said they liked having their own ‘ private forest ’			1
now @entity65 has made an order under the @entity67 that the two main conifer trees be cut to 5ft by september 28 and should never exceed 6ft 6ins			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i understand people have the right to live how they want but you need to be reasonable			2
i can not wait to be able to finally open my windows and have a bit of sunlight through them			0
order : @entity65 has now ruled @entity7 has to lop the 20ft trees back down to the more reasonable height of 5ft			0

two conifers given as a gift have *sparked* a *war* between two neighbours
@entity18 row has its roots in an old hedge that was removed in 1996
was *replaced* with conifers which now block out light to @entity2 's home
