” ' why was all this buried in a drawer ? well , i did n’t know			2
‘ then i realised i was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female heirs			1
they did n’t really want it , i do n’t think , because they do n’t really lead the kind of life that i lead as a well - known writer , and i ’m out and about			1

@entity101 - born miss @entity0 has sold over 88 million books in more than 90 countries ' when i look at those things and when i was going back in time , because we are coving the 80s and the 90s , a lot of the memories of how he gave the piece to me sprang in to my mind			1
