her legs felt too heavy to move			1
devastated , she considered freeing @entity18 from his responsibility of care			2
she said : ‘ we had big plans for our wedding			0
we had day - dreamed of an ice hotel or a cruise before settling on a nice local hotel which all our friends and family could get to			0
‘ but now i could n’t use my legs at all , and i could n’t control my bladder			1
all i saw when i looked in the mirror was a complete mess			0
i told @entity18 i did n’t expect him to have to cope			0

‘ @entity18 would n’t hear a minute of it			0
he told me he would always be there to look after me and he was n’t going anywhere			0

he ’s done so much to get me through			0
’ mrs @entity7 , supported by @entity18 , a farm manager , her daughter @entity134 , 22 , son @entity27 , 26 , and @entity18 ’s daughter @entity135 , 18 , and son @entity137 , 16 , began an intensive course of physiotherapy			1
she said : ‘ i began by simply moving over to the side of the bed			0
then , slowly , i tried standing			0
i was so wobbly because i could n’t feel my legs			1
it was a very weird feeling			2
‘ the physiotherapists give me a @entity146 frame , but after two steps i was exhausted			0
every day they tried to push me a little bit more			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' my whole life has completely changed and i had to go through a grieving process before i came to terms with that			1

considering what we ’d been through , the song was perfect			0
‘ we chose @entity165 by @entity166 for our first dance			0
it ’s quite a fast song			0
it was n’t until the @entity170 announced that the song was coming on that i realised i should have chosen a slower ballad instead - something which would have been easier to sway to			0
‘ we still managed to dance for a few seconds before @entity134 brought everyone onto the floor to join us			0
’ mrs @entity7 said : ' me and @entity18 are so happy together			1
he has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible			0

i just get on with life ' mrs @entity7 , who has been diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome , is no longer in physiotherapy and has come to terms with the fact that she will never gain full control over her lower body			1
cauda equina syndrome is caused by compression of the nerves in the spine and results in bladder and / or bowel dysfunction , loss of sensation and weakness in the legs			1
she said : ‘ i try and walk a little bit each day to prevent muscle wastage			2
the lack of bowel and bladder control is n’t brilliant but i have systems in place to help me manage			1
i have a little bit more control back			2
‘ my whole life has completely changed and i had to go through a grieving process before i came to terms with that			0
i had to face the fact i could n’t work anymore			0
‘ me and @entity18 are so happy together			0
he has encouraged me to go out and live my life as normal as possible			0
‘ now , i ’m not bothered by it			0
i just get on with life			0

@entity7 , 54 , lost the feeling in her legs when an *undetected* abscess in her spine suddenly burst spreading poison through her body
