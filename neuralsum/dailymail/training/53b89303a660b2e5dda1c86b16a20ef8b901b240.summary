@entity11 dr @entity2 , 37 , earned two degrees and began his phd while behind bars - but says he should not be a rare success story			1
at the age of 18 , two days after his mother passed away from cancer , @entity2 killed his drug dealer with a softball bat inside his home in @entity22			1
it was @entity24 1995 , @entity2 was hooked on morphine and the 42 - year - old man had just made an ‘ aggressive ’ sexual advance towards him			1
@entity2 has spoken out about his time in prison in the same week that campaign group @entity30 release their report into the @entity33 prison system			1
@entity2 said he initially began taking drugs as a teenager after getting involved with a bad group of friends and his addiction spiralled out of control when his mother became ill. ‘ as she got sicker and sicker , i got heavier into it			1
i came from a family of boys , we were all pretty tough			0
@entity46 was the emotional support			0
she was the only person i had in my life in that sense , ’ he told @entity40			0
‘ i did n't cope very well , i made some really bad decisions that got me into a bad situation			0

he remembers feeling ‘ the greatest despair imaginable ’			0
‘ i felt that i had been the victim			0
i recognised that my response had caused the death of someone else but i also felt that i was the victim , ’ he said			0
as he arrived at prison in 1996 he received a terrifying greeting			2
‘ people kicked their doors and shouted “ hang yourself or i 'm going to come and get you tomorrow ” … i remember thinking “ what have i got myself into ”			0
’ @entity2 admitted he got into a lot of fights at school but was ‘ always polite to teachers ’			1
‘ i had a bad habit of gravitating towards the bad people , ’ he said			0
unfortunately that habit was n’t broken when he arrived in prison			2
' for the first couple of years , i did drugs and got in fights and thought “ oh well they say i ’m a really bad person so that 's the kind of person i will be ”			1
‘ by the time i was 20 i was moved to maximum security because i was non-compliant , i continued to do drugs - anything i could get my hands on , mostly smoking weed every day			1
’ after prison : @entity2 ( on the right ) in 2007 shortly after his release from prison			1
' my brother @entity112 ( left ) wanted to take me to do something awesome , so took me snowboarding , and it was awesome , ' @entity2 said			1
then one day on his maximum security block at @entity116 , @entity2 met his first mentor – a convicted safe cracker - who allowed him to imagine a different path in life			1

' education led me out of danger , ’ he said			0
he was surprised when he passed his first two psychology degree papers – especially after dropping out of high school			2
‘ it made me think i was capable of more … but to do that i had to stop smoking weed and drugs because i was spending all time in solitary confinement			2
’ thanks to the support of his father , who visited him every weekend for almost 11 - years , and @entity153 whose lecturers travelled two hours out of their way to visit @entity2 in prison , @entity2 went on to complete his masters and was halfway through his phd by the time he left jail			1
huge achievement : dr @entity2 receiving his doctorate from @entity153 chancellor dr @entity161 in 2012 moving forward : ' i 'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be , ' @entity2 explained ' i think they saw that i was generally interested in trying to be a better person and be who i really was , ’ he explained			1
' my father visited me every weekend			0
he would bring me my books , send out assignments			0

’ teaching : @entity2 now coaches others on changing their lives and has even gone back and spoken to prisoners in his former jails he believes prisoners should be given an informed choice of their options and should really become accountable for their offending			1

' i 'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be , ’ he said			2
@entity2 is not against prisons and believes they are ‘ absolutely necessary for the worst offenders ’ and people with ‘ pathological issues ’			1
but he thinks the majority of criminals are people who may bad decisions			0
' i get asked about this stuff because i 'm considered an exception - but should n't i be the rule ? are n’t i what prisons are supposed to create ? ’ @entity2 has received a negative backlash against his views but thinks that whatever stand you take personally , talking about prisoner rehabilitation is an ' important conversation for society ’ to have			2
‘ you have to be honest			0
if you want to punish people harshly you can , but do n’t do so under the guise that it will help reduce re-offending , ’ he said			0
since being released from prison in 2006 , @entity2 collected his phd in 2012 and has set up his own coaching and consulting company			1
he is in love , after meeting a ‘ very smart , no nonsense woman ’			2
