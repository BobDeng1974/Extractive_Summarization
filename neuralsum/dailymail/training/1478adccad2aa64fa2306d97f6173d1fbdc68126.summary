three @entity1 figures have accused @entity3 ’s government of turning a blind eye to child abuse and terrorism in the @entity7 – for fear of inflaming community tensions			1
former mp @entity10 said the ‘ politically correct brigade ’ predominant on the left dismissed her warnings after she exposed a sex - abuse scandal involving @entity17 men in her constituency			1
@entity20 mp @entity19 said far too many on the left had been guilty of ‘ obsessing about multiculturalism ’ rather than more important issues such as child rape			1
demanding answers : @entity19 ( left ) and @entity27 blast @entity1 for ' turning a blind eye to abuse ' and @entity27 , a former @entity29 minister and mp for @entity31 , said he was threatened with the sack by @entity33 for urging @entity34 to turn away from terrorism			1
the sustained criticism of the @entity3 government ’s record came as it emerged that @entity39 will launch an investigation into whether the @entity41 knew about allegations of abuse in @entity31 as far back as 2001			1
at least 1,400 girls as young as 11 were assaulted and raped by gangs of @entity17 men over a period of 16 years			1
some had guns pointed at them or were doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight			2
the @entity51 home affairs committee will question home secretary @entity52 over what her department knew about what had gone on in @entity31			1
it is now known that in 2002 , a @entity41 researcher was conducting an investigation into trafficking and underage prostitution by mainly @entity7 gangs in @entity31 , but it was never published			1
home secretary at the time was @entity1 ’s @entity64 , and there is no suggestion that he knew of the report ’s existence			2
but the committee of mps will ask whether there was an overriding culture in the @entity3 government aimed at avoiding any harm to community cohesion			1
@entity76 , chairman of the committee , said : ‘ we would be very keen to get from the @entity41 a full and frank response to the research that was commissioned in 2002			2
‘ this is an essential part of the jigsaw to determine why the council failed to act , and whether the @entity41 could have done more to ensure that it did act			2
‘ we want to see every piece of information the @entity41 holds on this , and i will be writing to the home secretary to ask that the databases are searched to see what files it holds on this horrific behaviour in @entity31			2
’ former @entity1 mp ms @entity10 said that when she raised similar issues in her constituency of @entity99 between 2002 and 2004 , her views were dismissed			1
‘ a politically correct left just saw it as racism , ’ she said			2
the mp was shunned by elements of her party and a panic button was installed in her house			0
under fire : @entity3 's administration is accused of putting social cohesion above investigations into abuse speaking on @entity115 ’s @entity114 programme , she said : ‘ the politically correct brigade will always have anxieties about this sort of thing			1
‘ you do n’t want to give the @entity121 and the @entity123 ammunition , but i had to think if these were my daughters i ’d be very upset about this , so what can i do to alleviate the situation			0
’ ms @entity10 revealed that former @entity129 mayor @entity128 suggested she had ‘ misunderstood ’ the situation in @entity99			1
‘ @entity132 is an understatement			0
’ the former mp called for mandatory reporting so that doctors , teachers and social workers are obliged to flag up suspected abuse			2
‘ schools and hospitals have to pay a more active part in these things , ’ she said			0
mr @entity19 , who has done much to expose abuse carried out by @entity17 men in his constituency of @entity20 , said that some of his @entity1 colleagues disapproved of his efforts			1
‘ last week i received a text message from a current @entity1 mp saying she was disappointed by my views on this issue , ’ he wrote			0
‘ i was only elected in 2010 and already i ’ve found that politicians are sometimes discouraged from exploring and investigating complex issues because they ’re expected to stay tethered to a dominant ideology and not stray far from the stock replies to difficult questions			0
‘ i ’m in no doubt that @entity31 is not an isolated case , and the same kind of abuse is happening right now in towns and cities across the country			0
‘ if we ’re going to save a lost generation from having childhood innocence ripped from them , then we need to stop obsessing about multiculturalism and reform children ’s services now			0
’ mr @entity19 said that in too many councils , ‘ management exists in a bubble ’ and espouse views ‘ where political correctness and cultural sensitivity are more important than child rape ’			1
‘ managers become more interested in ticking boxes in diversity training than protecting children , ’ he said			0
‘ this is dogma for breakfast , lunch and dinner			0
common sense is not on the menu			0
’ last week former foreign office minister @entity27 admitted he did not do enough to speak up about child abuse in his @entity31 seat because he was ‘ a @entity193 - reading liberal @entity192 ’ who did not want to ‘ rock the multicultural community boat ’			1
but yesterday the mp , who stepped down two years ago after being found guilty of expenses fraud , revealed he had criticised @entity34 who supported terrorism – and was threatened with the sack by the then foreign secretary , @entity33			0
he had called on @entity34 in the @entity201 to choose between the ‘ @entity201 way or the way of the terrorists ’ after a 24 - year - old from @entity206 tried to bomb @entity207 in a @entity209 bar in 2003			0
the former minister said he was forced to agree to a ‘ grovelling climb - down ’ because he was warned his remarks could upset community relations			0
mr @entity27 had planned to say it was ‘ time for the elected and community leaders of @entity201 @entity34 to make a choice : the @entity201 way , based on political dialogue and non-violent protests , or the way of the terrorists against which the whole democratic world is uniting			1
’ ‘ @entity33 spent an inordinate amount of time cossetting his @entity7 constituents in @entity224 , ’ he said			0
‘ he had brought in an official from the @entity226 to advise the @entity29 on outreach to @entity229 outfits like the @entity230 in @entity231			0
‘ to attack their values was heresy			2
i was told i was close to being fired as a minister unless i signed some grovelling climb - down which , as a coward , i did			0

@entity10 , @entity19 and @entity27 launch attack on @entity3
they claim his administration turned a blind eye to abuses by @entity17 gangs
committee will ask whether social cohesion was put before investigations
