a @entity1 district attorney who has pursued @entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity2 over alleged campaign finance violations told a fellow prosecutor that his crying wife , a union official , drove him to hunt the governor and his conservative allies because of his anti-union laws feared by organized labor			1
the explosive revelation came tuesday as lawyers for @entity15 da @entity13 began two days of oral arguments in a @entity18 courtroom over earlier rulings that effectively ended his wide - ranging investigation			1
the investigation aimed to show that conservative groups were illegally working hand - in - hand with @entity2 's office when they ran ' issue ads ' pressing the case that public employee unions should face reforms			1
such arrangements , attorneys say , are common on both sides of the political aisle – including president @entity35 's longstanding coordination with @entity36 and other ' super pacs			1
' leaders of virtually every conservative political nonprofit in the @entity3 , 29 in all , have found themselves swept up in @entity13 's criminal probe as they were hit with pre-dawn raids that seized their computers , cell phones , email records – and even a child 's @entity45			1
@entity70 have accused @entity13 of using heavy - handed tactics , furthered by police using floodlights to illuminate suburban homes as flashing squad cars jammed driveways and cul - de - sacs			2
none of the targets of the searches were ever convicted of any crime , and few were charged			0
since @entity13 prosecuted an unrelated 2009 embezzlement case that @entity2 's office urged him to take up when he was a county executive , conservatives have wondered why the @entity14 expanded the probe into what @entity3 insiders call a ' @entity88 ' investigation – ensnaring dozens of @entity2 's aides and allies once he became governor in 2010			1
the @entity88 proceeding , peculiar to @entity3 , allowed @entity13 to enforce a gag order demanding complete secrecy from his targets and potential witnesses , prohibiting them from discussing the case , defending themselves in public or firing back when damaging documents were leaked to the press			2
@entity13 has persisted despite defeats in every court that has weighed in			0
writing for the @entity106 , an @entity105 investigator chronicled an interview with an unnamed @entity13 confidant – formerly a fellow prosecutor – to whom he explained his reasons			1
@entity113 's wife @entity112 , he said , repeatedly broke down in tears and insisted he go after the governor following the passage of a 2011 budget law that trimmed the sails of the state 's powerful public employee unions			2
mrs. @entity121 , a teacher , represented a union as her school 's designated shop steward			1
@entity125 reported that she feared what would become one of the biggest reversals of labor power in @entity57 history			0
his wife ' frequently cried when discussing the topic of the union disbanding and the effect it would have on the people involved … she took it personally , ' mr. @entity13 reportedly told his close associate , who has not come forward because he fears retaliation in the rough - and - tumble atmosphere of @entity3 union politics			1
@entity2 's law drew riotous protests from liberal groups organized by union labor , leading to months of marches and sit - ins at the state @entity61			1
angry picketers harassed @entity2 in front of his home and some of the governor 's supporters received death threats			1
the activists were angry at @entity2 because their unions were to be required , for the first time , to contribute to employees ' pensions and health insurance plans			2
the law also forbade them from collectively bargaining for benefits the went beyond wages			0
@entity2 survived a recall effort in 2012 , winning more votes than he had in his original 2012 election and fueling conservatives ' hopes that organized labor 's day in the sun had passed judge @entity172 slapped down @entity13 's attempts to criminalize conservatives ' political ads , saying that they could work with @entity2 's office as long as they were n't advocating for any candidates the @entity105 's source said @entity13 told him ' he felt that it was his personal duty to stop @entity2 from treating people like this			1
' mrs. @entity121 , like hundreds of teachers , joined in the protests			0
so did many members of her husband 's ostensibly impartial staff , according to the source			0
@entity13 's criminal probe widened 18 times , court records show			1
but ultimately judges at the state and federal level slapped him down and brought his investigation to a screeching halt			0
@entity57 district court judge @entity172 ruled in may that the investigation ran afoul of @entity3 law and the @entity199 since it hinged on the idea that right - wing activists were illegally coordinating their ads with the governor 's office			1
that legal theory , @entity205 wrote , was ' simply wrong			0
' governments , he ruled , can only regulate issue ads run by outside groups if they specifically advocate for or against a candidate by name , offering ' express advocacy ' or its ' functional equivalent			0
' referring to the heavy - handed raids , @entity205 vented that ' attempts to purify the public square lead to … the @entity218 and the @entity219			0
' chaos : @entity2 's law restricting public sector unions threatens to become a blueprint for other states ' conservative activists , worrying labor leaders who have never seen their power diminished so quickly once and future president ? @entity2 is touted as a possible 2016 @entity230 contender ; the kind of alleged political coordination with outside issue groups that drove the investigation against him reached its high point during president @entity35 's two successful elections worse , he determined that @entity13 's prosecution team had no ' reasonable expectation of obtaining a valid conviction			1
' on tuesday and wednesday , the 7th @entity240 in @entity18 heard oral arguments as @entity13 sought to overturn the ruling			0
@entity105 president @entity243 , whose organization commissioned the story , told @entity246 that @entity13 's actions would be equally improper if he were a @entity70			2
' abuses of the public trust are exactly what journalists should be investigating , no matter which party is to blame , ' he said			0
' we launched this three - month investigation and hired a former @entity257 @entity256 correspondent to run it because it seemed like @entity13 was using his office to criminalize ordinary political activity , ' @entity243 explained			2
' he told colleagues that his wife 's tears motivated him to criminally investigate a sitting governor			2
the courts found that he had no legal basis			0
that should embarrass even the unions			0
' @entity271 professor @entity270 called tuesday 's revelations ' chilling			0
' ' to date , ' he said , ' no one has been able to explain why district attorney @entity13 has gone to the lengths he has gone to try to find criminal conduct that could taint governor @entity2			2
if this new information is accurate , now we know the motivation , and there needs to be an investigation of the investigators			0

@entity15 da @entity13 pursued @entity3 gov. @entity2 's staff and 29 conservative nonprofits for years
@entity2 - backed laws curbing unions ' power provoked a labor - led 2012 recall effort that *narrowly* failed
@entity13 widened his investigation 18 times as the controversy raged , hunting @entity2 's allies with pre-dawn suburban raids
armed police seized computers , phones , the governor 's *private* emails with *donors* – including @entity305 – and even a child 's @entity45 .
@entity13 told a fellow prosecutor that he was motivated by weeping complaints from his wife , a *schoolteacher* and labor shop steward whose union stood to lose if @entity2 's policies prevailed .
