by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:35 est , 28 february 2014 the ancestors of @entity4 may have set up home in a region between @entity7 and @entity8 which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires , according to a new study it was a mystery how the ancestors of @entity4 survived the @entity13			1
but now a team of international scientists think they might have solved the mystery and it has to do with the ancient people living in a wooded tundra area after splitting from their @entity20 relatives 25,000 years ago			1
the ancestors of @entity4 probably set up home in a region between @entity7 and @entity8 , which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires , according to a new study			1
a group of academics at @entity29 , and the universities of @entity31 and @entity32 analysed fossils to come to this conclusion			1
until now no - one had any idea about where the ancestors of @entity4 spent around 10,000 years before they arrived in @entity8 and the rest of @entity37			2
professor @entity38 , from the @entity39 at @entity29 said : ‘ this work fills in a 10,000 - year missing link in the story of the peopling of the @entity44			2
’ the experts think that the group of people must have lived on the @entity48 , which is now under the waters of the @entity48 and @entity50			1
the land bridge and some adjacent regions were not as dry as the rest of @entity48 - the region surrounding the @entity55 , including parts of @entity57 and @entity8 – and the central part where the @entity4 are now thought to have lived , was covered in shrub tundra , which is the most common vegetation in modern @entity8			1
the landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs , mosses and lichens			0
professor @entity38 said : ‘ we believe that these ancestors survived on the shrub tundra of the @entity48 because this was the only region of the @entity8 where any woody plants were growing			1
’ this map shows the outlines of modern @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) with dashed lines			0
the broader area in darker green ( now covered by ocean ) represents the @entity48 near the end of the last glacial maximum , a period that lasted from 28,000 to 18,000 years ago when sea levels were low and ice sheets extended south into what is now the northern part of the lower 48 states			2
@entity86 anthropologist @entity85 argues in the feb. 28 issue of the journal @entity89 that the ancestors of @entity4 migrated from @entity20 onto the @entity48 or ¿ @entity48 ¿ some 25,000 years ago and spent 10,000 years there until they began moving into the @entity90 15,000 years ago as the ice sheets melted			1
the theory , now known as the ' @entity93 , ' was first proposed in 1997 by two @entity95 geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the @entity97 in @entity98 that sampled mitrochondrial dna from more than 600 @entity4			0
the researchers found that mutations in the @entity99 indicated a group of their direct ancestors from @entity7 was likely isolated for at least several thousand years in the region of the @entity48 , the now - submerged plain that lies between northeast @entity20 and @entity8 once exposed by a significantly lower sea level			2
‘ they needed the wood for fuel to make camp fires in this bitterly cold region of the world			2
they would have used dwarf shrub wood to get a small fire going , then placed large mammal bones on top of the fire , to ignite the fats inside the bones			0
‘ once burning , large leg bones of ice - age mammals would have burned for hours , keeping people alive through @entity8 winter nights			0
’ the academics analysed insect and plant fossils extracted from sediment cores taken from the ancient land bridge , to make the discovery			1
it now lies on the sea floor between 50 and 60 metres below the water ’s surface			0
work by @entity38 and others included the analysis of certain beetle species that live in very specific temperature zones , allowing them to be used as tiny thermometers			0
the insects indicated that temperatures there were relatively mild during last glacial maximum that ran from about 27,000 years to 20,000 years ago , only slightly cooler than temperatures in the region today			0
the central part of @entity48 where the native americans are now thought to have lived , was covered in shrub tundra , which is the most common vegetation in modern @entity8 ( pictured )			1
the landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs , mosses and lichens			0
' the climate on the land bridge and adjacent parts of @entity7 and @entity8 was a bit wetter than the interior regions like central @entity8 and the @entity161 , but not a lot warmer , ' said @entity38			1
' our data show that woody shrubs were available on the land bridge , which would have facilitated the making of fires by the people there			1
' the theory , now known as the ' @entity93 , ' was first proposed in 1997 by two @entity95 geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the @entity97 in @entity98 that sampled mitrochondrial dna from more than 600 @entity4			0

the people we know as @entity4 arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations			2
most native americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a ' land bridge ' between @entity20 and @entity37 during the ice ages 15,000 years ago			1
these migrants , known as the ' @entity189 ' , populated most of @entity90			0
all the groups originally came from @entity7 , @entity48 - a land bridge between @entity20 and @entity37 that existed during the ice ages , more than 15,000 years ago			1
by studying variations in @entity4 dna sequences , a team of scientists found in 2012 that while most of the @entity4 populations arose from the first migration , two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions			0
the second and third migrations have left an impact only in @entity8 populations that speak @entity204 languages and in the @entity206 who speak a na - dene language			0
eskimos show the most differences , with just 50 per cent of their dna coming from the ' @entity189 ' .			0

experts at @entity29 and the universities of @entity31 and @entity32 said people must have lived on the @entity48
ancestors of @entity4 used wood from the shrub tundra to build fires and keep warm , it is thought
