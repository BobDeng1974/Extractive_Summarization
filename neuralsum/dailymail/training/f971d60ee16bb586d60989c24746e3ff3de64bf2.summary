@entity0 are on the verge of winning their bid to host the semi-finals and final of @entity6 but one of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are poised to miss out on staging matches at the tournament			1
the @entity13 's bid for @entity14 to stage the climax of the event , which is being held in 13 cities across @entity18 , will be decided at @entity20 's executive committee meeting in @entity21 on friday			1
only @entity22 stands in @entity14 's way , but the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) has effectively agreed to stand aside in return for support for its bid for @entity28			1
@entity14 looks set to host the @entity6 final @entity13 chairman @entity30 will find out on @entity14 whether the bid has been successful the bids for @entity34 's @entity33 , @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37 to host three group games and a knockout match each appears less clear - cut			1
@entity13 chief executive @entity41 acknowledged it was ' highly unlikely ' that all four @entity44 and @entity45 bids would be successful			1
@entity7 have the most to fear after the commercial side of their bid was described as ' inadequate ' in @entity20 's technical reports			1
@entity41 said : ' there are four bids from the @entity44 and @entity9 and i think it is highly unlikely all four are going to be hosts			0
' it 's a difficult one to call			2
we have gone from over 30 countries down to 19 and we have read all the technical reports and there are pluses and minuses in most of them			0
' it is out of our hands , but in our favour we have the history and heritage of @entity34 including some of the most famous @entity18 club and international games			1
because it is the 60th anniversary of the @entity72 we think history will feature very heavily in its branding			0
' we believe our bid is technically strong			2
there were a number of concerns raised about the bid but there were concerns raised about almost all of them			2
' @entity34 's @entity33 hopes to win the right to host some @entity6 2020 games the @entity35 in @entity36 could stage some tournament football the @entity87 in @entity22 is @entity14 's only potential opposition to host the semi-finals and final @entity8 ' bid was given a boost by the @entity20 technical report , which rated the @entity35 third overall and in terms of income generation to @entity20			1
@entity97 , chief executive of the @entity98 , said : ' we know that we 've got a very strong bid			2
we also know that the @entity35 was third ranked as far as the income generation to @entity20 , based , of course , across the capacity and hospitality offering that we have in the city			1
' we 've done all we can			0
' i 've gone about our political campaign in a very professional manner			0
we 've met with every single executive committee member and we 've presented our case to all of them			0
i 've written now , probably , three times to them			0
' the @entity115 bid , the @entity116 bid , the @entity117 bid , the @entity45 bid - they 're all strong bids			0
' the issue now is about the politics behind it and it 's whether or not the @entity44 are perceived , with @entity7 , @entity0 and @entity8 all bidding , as having too many in what some still regard as one country			0
' @entity20 's 17 executive members will vote on the 13 host cities , but if their countries are involved they will not be allowed to take part			1
it means 15 members can vote for the host city for the final , but only eight members initially in the vote for the group stage hosts			2
it is expected that votes will be done on a ' ranking ' basis , with members ranking their top four venues in terms of preference .			0

@entity14 and @entity87 in @entity22 the only cities in the running to host the semi-finals and finals
but the @entity150 @entity13 has effectively agreed to stand aside in return for support for @entity28 bid
@entity34 's @entity33 , @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37 also in running to host matches
@entity20 will choose 13 cities from across @entity18 to stage games
