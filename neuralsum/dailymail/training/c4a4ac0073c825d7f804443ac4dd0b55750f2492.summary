by @entity0 for @entity1 this orangutan certainly was n't monkeying around when it came to this dangerous river crossing			2
these incredible photos how brainbox @entity5 used a long , staff - like stick to literally test the waters - finding out whether the river was too deep to cross			1
he looks almost human as he prods the branch into the river , before wading his way in			0
he was released into the wild earlier this year but he appears to have picked up tricks from his human carers			1
one of the teams from the @entity29 was monitoring @entity31 's progress when they spotted him at the bank of the @entity33 with a long branch			0
not af - wade : @entity5 does not mind getting wet as he wades across the river , trusty stick in hand he carefully inserted it into the water to measure the depth then , after realising it was safe to cross , made his way in			1
but unluckily , @entity5 lost grip of the branch and watched it float away			1
the clever animal then realised it would be unwise to cross the river without it , and reluctantly turned back			2
dr @entity47 , @entity48 in @entity49 , a charity which raises funds for the orangutan release programme at @entity29 , said the animal 's behaviour was not a surprise			0
' the great apes are considered to be the most intelligent animals , other than humans , and orangutans are regarded as the smartest amongst primates , ' she said			0
' sharing 98 per cent of our dna , their similarity to us is remarkable - they 're adaptable and innovative , and there 's rarely an obstacle they can not overcome			0

@entity5 was rescued by the @entity19 and @entity20
was released back into the @entity24 wild earlier this year
