@entity0 announced on tuesday that @entity1 , pictured here in 2007 at the @entity3 , is publishing a book she set aside almost 50 years ago ' @entity5 ' will not be the reclusive author @entity1 's only published book after all			1
in an announcement that left millions both shocked and thrilled , publisher @entity1 announced tuesday that ' @entity9 , ' a completed novel the @entity12 - winning author wrote in the 1950s then put aside unpublished , will hit store shelves in july			2
the news instantly turned 88 - year - old @entity16 's lost tome into one of the most eagerly anticipated novels in years			1
it also leaves open for speculation what sort of massive book deal a living legend author who spent most of her life avoiding ever releasing more than a single , beloved novel might receive			2
rediscovered last fall , ' @entity9 ' is essentially a sequel to ' @entity5 , ' although it was finished earlier			0
the 304 - page book will be @entity16 's second , and the first new work in more than 50 years			1
the publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies			1
' in the mid- 1950s , i completed a novel called ' @entity9 , '' @entity16 said in a statement issued by @entity1			1
' it features the character known as @entity39 as an adult woman , and i thought it a pretty decent effort			1
my editor , who was taken by the flashbacks to @entity39 's childhood , persuaded me to write a novel ( what became ' @entity5 ' ) from the point of view of the young scout			1
' i was a first - time writer , so i did as i was told			0
i had n't realized it ( the original book ) had survived , so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer @entity53 discovered it			1
' after much thought and hesitation , i shared it with a handful of people i trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication			0
i am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years			2
' according to publisher @entity1 , @entity64 came upon the manuscript at a ' secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of to kill a mockingbird			1
' the new book is set in @entity16 's famed @entity5 , @entity72 , during the mid- 1950s , 20 years after ' @entity5 ' and roughly contemporaneous with the time that @entity16 was writing the story			1
@entity1 spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel to kill a mockingbird			1
so , less than three months since the death of her sharp - as - a - tack lifelong confidante sister @entity83 , should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s ? according to @entity89 , such suspicion is warranted			2
protector : @entity1 's older sister @entity83 ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100 , having remained all that time her sister 's staunch defender and protector the 88 - year - old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007 , when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair - bound , nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own			1
@entity16 is now represented by @entity53 , who succeeded @entity83 in the family firm			2
according to @entity100 , ' @entity16 has a history of signing whatever 's put in front of her , apparently sometimes with @entity64 's advice			1
' @entity64 has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by @entity16 , even once going after a business owner in @entity16 's beloved hometown of @entity111 , @entity72 who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel			1
@entity117 , who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight , died last year at the age of 103			0
with a new @entity1 book being released just months after her attorney sister ( pictured ) @entity83 's death , some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of @entity1 -- who 's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair - bound in 2007 -- or of someone else the civil rights movement was taking hold by the time she was working on ' @entity132			1
' the @entity133 had ruled unanimously in 1953 that segregated schools were unconstitutional , and the arrest of @entity136 in 1955 led to the yearlong @entity137			0
' @entity39 ( @entity141 ) has returned to @entity5 from @entity142 to visit her father , @entity143 , ' the publisher 's announcement reads			2
' she is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father 's attitude toward society , and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood			2
' @entity16 herself is a @entity111 , @entity72 native who lived in @entity142 in the 1950s			2
she now lives in her hometown			0
according to the publisher , the book will be released as she first wrote it , with no revisions			0
@entity16 , pictured here with @entity160 filming the movie version of to kill a @entity5 , said in a statement : after much thought and hesitation , i shared it with a handful of people i trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication ' @entity5 ' is among the most beloved novels in history , with worldwide sales topping 40 million copies			1

one of the most beloved novels in history , @entity16 's original novel has sold over 40 million copies			1
but it was written second although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes , the novel has become a standard for reading clubs and middle schools and high schools			2
the absence of a second book from @entity16 only seemed to enhance the appeal of ' mockingbird			1
' @entity16 's publisher said the author is unlike to do any publicity for the book			1
she has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s , when she told one reporter that she wanted to ' to leave some record of small - town , middle - class @entity205 life			0
' until now , ' @entity5 ' had been the sole fulfillment of that goal			0
' this is a remarkable literary event , ' @entity1 publisher @entity208 said in a statement			0
' the existence of ' @entity9 ' was unknown until recently , and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of ' to kill a mockingbird			0
' reading in many ways like a sequel to @entity1 's classic novel , it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter 's relationship , and the life of a small @entity72 town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s			2
' the new book also will be available in an electronic edition			0
@entity16 has openly started her preference for paper , but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow ' mockingbird ' to be released as an e-book			2

it was published in 1960 shortly after the dawn of the @entity255 civil rights movement and became required reading in many @entity255 schools			0
in the tome , a principled lawyer named @entity143 defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman and wins his family the scorn of many racist white residents of the fictional town of @entity5			0
@entity141 loses the case despite what would appear in today ’s terms to have been an airtight case of his client @entity271 innocence			0
@entity273 is jailed then shot dead after escaping custody — a ‘ mockingbird ’ whose innocence and then life are taken away by the malevolence of a violently racist society			0
to kill a mockingbird was made into a movie starring @entity177 and featuring @entity282 as @entity283 , the black farmhand accused of raping a white woman in depression - era @entity72 when @entity286 , a former @entity287 , last year wrote about being @entity16 's neighbor for year in , @entity289 : life with @entity1 , @entity16 disowned it			1
' @entity292 befriended my elderly sister , @entity83			0
