by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:34 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 16:53 est , 14 june 2012 former @entity3 tycoon @entity2 was sentenced on thursday to 110 years in prison for orchestrating one of the largest ponzi schemes in @entity8 history that had defrauded investors out of $ 7 billion in the course of 20 years			1
@entity12 ’s glittering billionaire innings that led to him being listed as the world ’s 605th richest person was declared over by a fellow @entity3 judge who ignored last - minute pleas from his lawyers to reduce the sentence to less than four years			1
the courtroom in @entity21 was packed with more than 150 people – many of them the victims of @entity12 ’s various schemes			1
jailbird : convicted financier @entity2 arrives at @entity27 in @entity21 for sentencing two of the estimated 17,000 victims of @entity12 ’s fraud were allowed to address the court			1
@entity33 , who represented @entity35 victims , addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly at @entity12 to tell him : ‘ you , sir , are a dirty , rotten , scoundrel			2
’ the other victims ’ spokesman , @entity39 , of the @entity40 , said of the fraudster : ‘ @entity2 has stolen more than billions of dollars			2
he took our lives as we knew them			0
’ she said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam			0
before learning his fate , @entity12 , dressed in green prison garb , a wide grin on his face , delivered a rambling statement in which he claimed that he had done nothing wrong , and that he was a scapegoat			1
guilty : @entity2 was convicted in march of 13 of 14 counts of fraud he blamed the federal government and a @entity8 - appointed receiver who took over his companies in 2009 , saying they tore down his business empire and prevented his investors from getting any of their money back			1
in march , following a seven - week trial , @entity2 was convicted of 13 of 14 fraud - related counts , among them wire and mail fraud			1
speaking for more than 40 minutes , @entity2 told a judge he 's ‘ not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness			2
’ ever the showman , @entity12 , 62 , waved to his elderly mother , @entity72 , who sat in the well of the court alongside @entity2 ’s daughter , @entity75			1
prosecutors sought a 230 - year prison term , the maximum possible sentence , while the defense asked for a maximum of 44 months			1
the prosecutor told @entity8 district judge @entity82 : ‘ 230 years will not get anyone their money back but on sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum			1
’ @entity2 ’s attorney , @entity88 , objected to the use of the term ‘ @entity91 , ’ but @entity92 said the evidence at trial justified the use of the term			1
during the hearing , the prosecutors also compared him to the infamous @entity100 financier @entity99 , who is currently serving a 150 - year prison term for similar crimes			1
@entity12 now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared ' indigent ' – penniless , which means that the government will have to spend tens of millions of dollars on court - appointed lawyers			1
he said : ' i ’m not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but i will tell you i did not run a ponzi scheme			0
i did n’t defraud anybody			0
' the former honorary knight of @entity119 was arrested in 2009			0
since then , all of his assets have been frozen and he has been represented by public defenders			0
the lengthy prison term does not bode well for @entity12 , who was severely beaten by another inmate while waiting for trial in jail			1
he was hospitalized and later transferred to a federal prison medical facility in @entity132 , @entity133 , as result of an addiction to anti-depressants , which he developed after the beating			0
cricket fan : the then sir @entity2 poses with the @entity142 team during the @entity144 match between @entity142 and @entity145 in 2008			1
he was later stripped of his knighthood traveling in style : @entity2 's 120 - foot yacht called the @entity149 is seen docked in @entity150 , @entity151 his defense team had claimed that the trauma left their client unable to remember anything , but government psychiatrist eventually determined that the financier was faking it and set a trial date			2
@entity12 was once considered one of the wealthiest men in the @entity8 , with an estimated personal net worth of more than $ 1.9billion , a $ 7.7million mansion on the @entity166 island of @entity151 , a moated mansion in @entity167 , which he called @entity169 , and a 120 - foot yacht named the @entity149			1
his financial empire stretched from the @entity8 to @entity35 and the @entity166			2
calling @entity12 arrogant and without remorse , prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought certificates of deposit , or cds , from his bank in @entity119 to fund a string of failed businesses , bribe regulators and pay for a lavish lifestyle that included yachts , a fleet of private jets and sponsorship of cricket tournaments			1
left in the lurch : : @entity191 headquarters in @entity192 , @entity193 from prince to pauper : the man who was once transporting chests filled with cash in his helicopter ( left ) has been declared indigent and having to rely on court - appointed lawyers @entity12 added moments before being led away : ‘ if i live the rest of my life in prison ... i will always be at peace with the way i conducted myself in business			1
’ the majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors , looking to cash - in on interest rates above bank rate			0
@entity215 , of @entity21 , @entity3 , who lost round $ 1.4million , said outside the court : ‘ this was a wholesale failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as @entity12			2
@entity223 : @entity12 has been compared to infamous financier @entity99 , who is currently serving a 150 - year prison term for a $ 50billion ponzi scheme ‘ here in @entity3 , we believe in capital punishment but i would not wish it on @entity12 , i want him to wake up every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all			1
’ in june of 2008 , @entity12 signed a controversial deal with the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) for a series of five @entity234 cricket games between @entity142 and a @entity166 side nicknamed the ‘ @entity236			1

his next trick was to fly into @entity249 cricket field in @entity250 aboard a personalized helicopter laden with treasure chests filled with cash			0
he planned to be the savior of @entity256 cricket , even though he admitted he never really understood the game			0
by the time of his arrest , in february of 2009 , the @entity142 has severed all ties with @entity12 and his honorary knighthood - a @entity166 title provided by @entity119 which he misleadingly claimed was bestowed upon him by the @entity263 - had been stripped			1
the jury that convicted @entity2 also cleared the way for @entity8 authorities to go after about $ 329million in stolen investor funds sitting in the financier ’s frozen foreign bank accounts in @entity250 , @entity270 and @entity271			2
three other former @entity12 executives are scheduled for trial in september			2

' they had asked for a prison sentence spanning more than two centuries , calling him a ' ruthless predator ' who stole from investors ' simply to satisfy his own greed and vanity			2
' he even claimed to be related to the founder of the elite @entity12 in @entity298 until it denied any relationship and then filed a trademark infringement against him for misusing its good name			2
but @entity12 ’s pretense at old - money grandeur is nothing new			2
his wedding in @entity309 ’s home town of @entity310 , @entity3 , on a hot september evening in 1975 was reported in the local newspaper as if it were a dynastic match , with the bride adorned in ‘ @entity315 lace , lavishly appliqued on white @entity256 net ’			0
@entity310 , however , turned out to be a dusty rural town on the scorched cattle prairie of @entity3			0
@entity309 ’s father was a train conductor and her parents own a simple bungalow on a street where their nearest neighbor lives in a trailer			0
in 2009 , @entity325 reported that besides his wife of more than three decades , @entity309 , from whom @entity12 got separated , he had several mistresses who were known as his ‘ outside wives			2

at the time , @entity12 ’s then - 81 - year - old father , @entity332 , said : ‘ i felt bad for @entity309 , him having all these outside wives and all these kids			1
