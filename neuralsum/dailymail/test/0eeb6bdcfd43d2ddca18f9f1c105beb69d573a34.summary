@entity0 sprang up and pumped the air with his fist			1
all of a sudden , there was a little extra bounce in his box - fresh training shoes and a fire in his belly burned a little more fiercely			0
as a @entity9 player and coach , @entity0 has fought hard across the capital with @entity12 over the years but through the first - half at @entity16 , his @entity14 team struggled to match their illustrious opponents			1
they backed off and defended , and offered a little too much respect to the team with the best form in the @entity23 since the turn of the year			0
@entity0 applauds fans after his @entity14 side were narrowly beaten by @entity12 at @entity16 @entity12 have been irresistible since they improved at the back and supplied a stronger base for the flair of their many attacking stars to perform upon			1
@entity32 and @entity33 , bought for a total of more than £ 70million , combined to open the scoring			0
what could @entity14 do with that sort of money ? @entity32 and @entity33 swaggered down the tunnel for the start of the second - half , deep in conversation , planning more damage but @entity14 stirred , found an equaliser and were able to add urgency to their game			2
@entity0 sprang up and threw a punch of delight into the air on the touchline			2
his team were back in the contest and they contributed to a thrilling @entity55 semi-final			1
it was their first since 1927 , so it would have been a shame to go home without a fight			0
as for @entity0 , this must have felt good			2
he has been away from the cut - and - thrust of football ’s elite since he was sacked by @entity63 , but here he detected an @entity55 final as @entity65 was unable to keep out a deflected volley from @entity67			2
the @entity14 boss won the @entity55 with @entity9 in 1994 , a game he considers a defining moment in the history of the @entity73 club			1
@entity14 's @entity67 ( bottom right ) celebrates after scoring a shock equaliser against @entity12 but @entity77 's goalkeeping error enabled @entity12 to regain the lead in extra time @entity0 consoles his dejected keeper following the full - time whistle at @entity16 they barely looked back and were tightening their grip on a fourth @entity23 title as @entity14 took @entity12 in extra-time			1
for all their quality , @entity87 ’s team still have vulnerabilities			0
@entity0 , having learned much at the shoulder of @entity91 , will have been aware of that			0
he will have been disappointed with the first - half display but hugely proud of their response and the desire they showed			0
in the end , @entity14 were unable to wreck @entity12 ’s defence of the trophy or @entity87 ’s drive towards becoming only the second manager in history to win it six times , after @entity106 with @entity107 , all prior to 1920			1
but , as @entity0 goes back to the championship and a home game against @entity110 , he will take strength from this display and use it to inspire his return to the top - flight			1
despite the defeat , @entity0 will hope the performance will inspire a @entity23 return			0

@entity14 lost 2 - 1 against @entity12 in @entity55 semi-final at @entity16
*royals* took much *fancied* @entity122 to extra-time after 1 - 1 draw
@entity0 will take strength from *impressive* @entity14 display
