by @entity0 @entity2 was saved from losing his job over allegedly saying the n - word by the @entity6 director general , reports claim			1
@entity7 overruled director of television @entity8 , who allegedly wanted to sack the @entity11 presenter			1
despite mass outrage , @entity7 handed @entity2 , 54 , a ' final warning ' after a lengthy meeting to settle the scandal			1
the controversial decision will save the @entity6 millions by keeping hit show @entity11 , which earns in excess of £ 150million a year in revenue			1
@entity2 became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media			1
historically the rhyme was ' eeny meeny miny mo , catch a n * * * * * by his toe ' , and @entity2 said he ' mumbled ' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it			1
in the third , which was broadcast , he said the word ' teacher ' instead			0
@entity8 , the @entity6 's director of television , allegedly called for @entity2 to be sacked or suspended it came just weeks after he referred to an @entity48 man as a ' slope ' during an episode of @entity11			1
@entity51 ' begged for forgiveness ' after admitting he was ' mortified ' at the footage which emerged			0
an online petition calling for the @entity6 presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures			1
labour figures including deputy leader @entity58 also demanded he should be sacked			0

and @entity67 mp @entity66 wrote : ' @entity2 announces he has one last chance			2
he 's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered			0
' but education secretary @entity70 urged the @entity6 not to axe @entity2 because he had been ' clear in his apology '			1
and the prime minister appeared to agree			0
mr @entity74 's official spokesman said : ' he does share the @entity70 's view : it is absolutely right that there has been an apology			0
' pressed on whether he also shared the view he should keep his job , he replied : ' his view is that in terms of actions and the like , that 's for the @entity6			2
' however , @entity2 has since declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to			2
he said he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again , admitting ' not even the angel gabriel ' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy			2
but the presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the @entity94 civil war because they were both things he had not done			0
a solemn - looking @entity2 said the item was recorded a ' couple of years ago ' and said he ' did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted ' the decision will save the @entity6 millions as @entity11 earns in excess of £ 150million in revenue a year ' i 've been told by the @entity6 that if i make one more offensive remark , anywhere , at any time , i will be sacked , ' he wrote			1
' and even the angel @entity108 would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head			0
' it 's inevitable that one day , someone , somewhere will say that i 've offended them , and that will be that			0
' he also wrote : ' happily , the @entity6 had a plan			2
unfortunately , it was n't a very good one			0
' an apology is a good idea if you 've just spilled some beer down someone 's shirt ... but saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all , and hoping the story would die down as a result ? ' the pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer , he claimed .			0
