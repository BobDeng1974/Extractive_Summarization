swimmers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a beach @entity3 beaches have been closed for a fourth straight day following the sighting of a great white shark when asked why the sharks are sticking around , he said there are two prevailing theories			1
‘ one idea is that it ’s a great white sanctuary			1
they might be coming in close to the shore to offer warm water to give birth and raise their young			0
’ ‘ the other idea is that the sharks started appeared in line with a cold current on saturday			2
there has been a lot of marine activity in the area since then and the sharks may be following suite , ’ he said			1
@entity105 beach inspector @entity104 says the closure has been the longest in his memory			0
' we 're a little bit frustrated , especially today because it 's such a nice day , ' he said			0

while some surfers have found the waves too tempting , most had kept clear of the water since the shark was first seen on saturday afternoon at @entity9			2

several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on saturday although a jet ski has been patrolling the beaches , mr @entity104 said a helicopter was needed to get a good look			1
' they might see more action in the ocean than we can see on a jet ski , ' he said			0
the helicopter will be searching for a shadow of the shark close to shore or behind the break			0
increased marine activity and overcast and warm weather are thought to be possible reasons for the shark 's prolonged presence			1
@entity147 , life sciences manager at @entity148 , said the shark 's behaviour in staying close to the coastline was not unusual			2
' it may be hunting eagle rays , which are a favourite food for sharks and are found close to the shore , ' he said			0
' great whites are very variable			0
they spend time in the surf where they are sometimes spotted by lifeguards and then they also have their massive oceanic migration where they travel to @entity162			2
' he added that people were better safe than sorry and should keep out of the water while the shark continues to be spotted			2

' my house is pretty close to the beach so when i heard the shark alarm go off , i grabbed my camera and quickly dashed down , ' the young photographer told @entity29			1
' i was overlooking the beach and saw a lot of jetskis around so i looked through the lens of my camera and snapped a few shots			0
it was n't until i got home , i realised i got a picture of the shark			0
' ' there were no attacks reported but the lifeguards did a great job to maintain and get everyone out of the water - they were very visual on their jetskis as well			2
' ' it 's quite irregular to have them hanging around constantly , ' he said			0
