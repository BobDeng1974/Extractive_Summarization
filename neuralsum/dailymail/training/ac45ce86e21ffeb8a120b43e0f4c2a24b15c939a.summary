by @entity0 , @entity1 editor automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks , including scotch whisky , have been axed to bring some cheer to @entity6 struggling with the cost of living			1
the move is part of a £ 300million sweetener for drinkers which the @entity12 freely admits is expected to result in ‘ higher consumption ’			1
in a radical shift , @entity14 is scrapping the alcohol duty escalator , which has increased the tax on drink by 2 per cent above inflation every year since 2008			1
cheers : chancellor @entity14 announced automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks will be axed to help bring some cheer to @entity6 struggling with the cost of living budget : yesterday 's @entity26 included a raft of welcome measures , including cutting the duty on beer , by the equivalent of 1p per pint and freezing the taxes on spirits including scotch he is also cutting the duty on beer by the equivalent of 1p a pint and freezing the tax paid on spirits , including @entity35 , to support the industry			1
the move will be welcomed at a time when @entity45 politicians are keen to woo @entity46 away from voting for independence in a referendum on september 18			1
however , the changes represent a major shift in fiscal and social policy away from using taxes to drive up the cost of booze as part of a concerted attempt to discourage excessive alcohol consumption			1
treasury papers issued alongside the @entity26 even make clear the changes will lead to a rise in drinking , stating : ‘ there will be an increase in consumption compared to the previous policy			2
’ the change puts the government on collision course with the medical profession which has been arguing for minimum alcohol prices in order to encourage @entity6 to cut back			2
a programme set up by the parents of @entity75 victim @entity74 to support @entity6 terror victims was saved			0
the government was embroiled in a row when it emerged the £ 150,000 - a - year survivors for peace project faced closure after @entity82 funding dried up			2
@entity83 , whose 12 - year - old son @entity84 was killed alongside @entity85 , three , in the @entity75 bombings in @entity87 in 1993 , last month criticised @entity89 ’s ‘ offensive and thoughtless ’ refusal to throw it a cash lifeline			0
y the chancellor committed a full year ’s funding to the programme and vowed to look for a permanent solution			2
the timing of the news was particularly poignant for mr @entity74 and his wife @entity97 who today mark the 21st anniversary of @entity84 ’s death			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ @entity100 no longer receives lottery funding			1
i know myself what incredible work they do			0
‘ to honour the memory of all victims of terrorism , we will provide the funding the programme needs			0
’ announcing the changes , mr @entity14 said : ‘ @entity46 whisky is a huge @entity6 success story			1
to support that industry , instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits , i am today going to freeze them			2
and with some cider makers in the @entity118 hit hard by the recent weather , i am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too			2
’ while home drinks producers have been given tax breaks , the chancellor said wine , which is mainly imported , will rise by 6p a bottle			1
high - strength sparkling cider goes up 8p a bottle			0
mr @entity14 said the automatic price rises linked to the alcohol duty escalator were no longer necessary or justified			1
‘ we ’ve introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates , and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs , and helps stop problem drinking , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers			1
’ however , the @entity12 documents said the new rules will increase consumption and cost the government £ 300million a year in lost taxes because of the savings given to drinkers			1
@entity151 , of the @entity152 , condemned the change as ‘ staggering ’			0
she said : ‘ with alcohol costing the country £ 21billion a year , and alcohol - related hospital admissions more than doubling over the last ten years , it comes as a shock to learn that the chancellor believes that it is right to further incentivise drinking by making alcohol cheaper			1
‘ it is yet more evidence to suggest the government has turned its back on public health and frontline workers such as nurses and police offers , who have to mop up the mess that alcohol creates day in day out			0
' it is yet another sad day to see how the profits of multi-national alcohol producers have been prioritised over public health and safety			0
’ while drinkers have been spared rises in duty , there has been no protection for smokers			1
the duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes has gone up by 24p			2
it will rise by 8p on a pack of five small cigars , 23p on a 25g pouch of hand - rolling tobacco and 13p on a 25g pouch of pipe tobacco			0
@entity46 vote : the move is likely to be welcomed at a time when politicians are keen to woo @entity46 away from voting for independence in the referendum on september 18 theatre companies will get tax relief of up to 25 per cent			1
performing arts companies , including those putting on dance , opera and plays , will be eligible for a tax break of 20 per cent			1
regional firms that tour will have their bills cut by an even more generous 25 per cent for any initial investment in new productions			2
the tax changes will come into effect september 1 following a consultation			1
theatre firms , many of which operate as charities , will welcome the move , particularly because it comes after cuts to funding for the arts during the recent austerity years			0
the @entity12 said the tax cut would be worth up to £ 15million a year and was in recognition of the ‘ unique value that the theatre sector brings to the @entity6 economy ’			1
the chancellor told mps that he was applying the same tax relief to theatres that is already offered to film companies			2
the @entity235 ’s new transferable tax allowance for married couples was made slightly more generous yesterday			0
@entity14 announced that the amount a person in a couple can transfer will be raised in line with the increase in personal income tax allowance			1
it was originally planned that a married person who earns under the £ 10,000 income tax threshold would be allowed to transfer £ 1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £ 200			2
but now the chancellor ’s move to raise the personal allowance to £ 10,500 means a husband or wife will be able to transfer £ 1,050 of their allowance to their spouse , cutting their annual tax bill by £ 210			1
only the 24million basic rate taxpayers will benefit , but @entity89 has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a @entity262 majority			0
@entity263 have said they will scrap the tax break if they win the election			0
flood defences will get a £ 140million boost following the devastation of the wettest winter for 250 years			0
the cash injection will be used to repair and improve defences across @entity6 , after about 5,000 properties were flooded and the @entity273 left underwater for weeks , causing around £ 1billion of damage			0
@entity89 visited flood - hit areas last month and said money would be ‘ no object ’ in the relief efforts			0
he promised a £ 5,000 ‘ repair and renew ’ grant to help homeowners who had been affected			0
but @entity263 claims the budget for maintaining defences has been cut by 20 per cent under the @entity235 , affecting flood - hit areas in @entity286 and @entity287			0
@entity289 groups say more money for defences is urgently needed			0
they point out that the government ’s climate independent advisers recommend an extra £ 500million .			0
