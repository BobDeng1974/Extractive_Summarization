' nobody really believed that a building of such civic importance would be demolished , ' said @entity24 , an architect and chairman of the @entity26			2
' it really created the coalescing of all factors to come together to save buildings important to @entity3 's identity			1
above , the beautiful @entity18 before its 1963 destruction the loss of the old @entity18 , which was replaced by @entity20 , helped lead to the establishment of a commission that can designate historic places as landmarks and prevent them being demolished the metal pillars of the old @entity18 station stand before bulldozers during its demolition			1

the @entity26 was given a mandate to preserve buildings and places of cultural , architectural and historical significance			1

the @entity94 ( right ) and other buildings in area built in the 1890s have been preserved by the city and still stand today the @entity99 , designed by a @entity100 on @entity101 , was widely criticized as ' @entity100 's monstrosity ' after it opened in 1880 and was torn down in the late 1930s the @entity103 , one of early 20th century @entity3 's movie palaces after it was built in 1927 ( left ) , was torn down in 1966 to make way for an office building			1
