taking the trip to the top of @entity2 , the new tower ride at @entity4 in @entity5 , is one of the most scenic experiences in @entity8			1
it is 335ft tall and the outward - facing seats provide a stunning view over the park and its surroundings , all the way to the distant sunshine - laden horizon			2
but then the @entity17 kicks in			0
riders are tilted forward , 33 storeys above the ground , and you realise the only way down is , well , down – at 60mph			0
on top of the world : @entity25 ’s @entity17 is the first drop tower of its kind in the world and it offers breath - taking views of the @entity5 area that , of course , is the full adrenaline - filled purpose of @entity4 ’ brand new attraction , which soars into the sky like a multi-coloured colossus and offers those brave enough to try it the most thrilling ride in the @entity8			1

@entity25 ’s @entity17 is the centrepiece of the park ’s revamped @entity43 area			1
it used to be called @entity46 but everything has been freshened up , with new buildings , new architecture , landscaping , dining options and a hilarious show , @entity52 , featuring a variety of creatures rescued from local animal shelters			0
not everyone will be brave enough to face the @entity17 , so @entity43 features rides and games for the less adrenaline - inclined			1
but even if you do n’t ride it , @entity17 offers great entertainment as it ’s almost as much fun to watch people ’s reactions as it is to plunge face - first on the ultra-smooth scream machine yourself			2
taking the plunge is also the signature experience of @entity72 ’s @entity71 water - park , @entity73 , which debuted another high - level fright-fest this summer in the shape of @entity77 ’s @entity76			1

it consists of a set of three capsules that drop riders vertically into enclosed body - slide water chutes			2
it is imaginatively set up so all three pods face each other , and there is a 3 - 2 - 1 countdown – complete with pounding - heartbeat sound effect before riders take the plunge in random fashion , one after another			2
you never know who will be first to drop , which adds to the excitement			0
after the breathtaking initial drop , during which everyone screams hysterically , there is then another 400ft of high - speed slide to enjoy on the way to a final splashdown			1
not everyone will be brave enough to face the @entity17 , so @entity43 features rides and games for the less adrenaline - inclined this is a ride that ’s unique in @entity8 – and one that is also fun just to watch			1
