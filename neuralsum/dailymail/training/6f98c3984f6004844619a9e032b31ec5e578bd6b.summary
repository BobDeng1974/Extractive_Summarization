big occasions at @entity1 always mean @entity2 is fully decorated and @entity4 's return to @entity6 combat was no exception			1
from the banner that was unfurled shortly before the teams emerged before kick - off declaring , in bold red lettering , ' we are @entity4 ' to the image of @entity15 simply proclaiming ' boss ' , there were nods to the characters that have shaped the club 's history			1
hanging in the far corner of one of football 's most famous stands , however , another took the eye			0
first given an airing during saturday 's limp 1 - 0 defeat against @entity30 , this flag had a profound message in @entity32 about one of the current squad			1
' @entity34 , ' were the stated words next to a picture of @entity37			1
@entity4 fans unfurl a banner dedicated to their latest hero @entity37 @entity37 began paying back his £ 16m investment by opening the scoring with his first goal for @entity4 @entity37 celebrates opening the scoring after @entity4 finally broke the deadlock in the second half the @entity48 international has the chance to become an @entity1 legend , according to @entity51 translated , you will discover it is one of @entity56 's most famous quotations , ' i have nothing to declare except my genius '			1
no matter that he had yet to complete 90 minutes for @entity4 , here was evidence of how swiftly @entity37 has been welcomed			1
@entity4 supporters are desperate for him to succeed			1
with memories of @entity67 beginning to fade , there is a position for someone to come in and make themselves the new darling of this ground and @entity51 explained the opening that is there for @entity37			1
' i hope he goes for it because it will be the making of him , ' @entity51 said recently			1
i ' have told him that			0
it was the first conversation i had with him			0
i told him ' @entity37 , it 's there for you '			1
i told him to think of the names that have gone before and how he can uphold the tradition of top strikers here			0
' we either produce them or find them			0
if i was in his position , at 24 years of age , i 'd go and grab it with both hands			0
i 'd sacrifice everything i could to grab it			0
if i was him i 'd think ' i want to goals , medals , big @entity98 night from my @entity4 career '			1
it 's all there for him			0
' @entity4 fans enjoyed their return to the @entity6 after a five - year absence from the competition captain @entity51 saved @entity4 's blushes with a late penalty to earn a 2 - 1 victory @entity37 seized the opportunity of leading @entity4 's line in the absence of the injured @entity113 match winners @entity51 ( r ) and @entity37 congratulate each other after securing a vital first win that may be so but , before this game , his career on @entity119 has yet to take flight			1
if there was some initial promise in the 3 - 0 win at @entity126 , there was a stall against @entity30			2
having been ill in the build - up , he was substituted after a limp display			2
what , then , would he follow up with ? with @entity1 expecting to take advantage of their most inviting assignment of @entity133 – a home date against @entity136 novices – @entity37 had a gilt - edged opportunity to start repaying the faith @entity15 has shown in him			1
much like his team , though , he found it hard to get going			0
his first significant passage of play was a run away from goal in the 13th minute but he could n't find the space to shoot , as two @entity147 defenders swarmed all over him			2
a first sight of goal arrived a few moments later but @entity150 was alert and thundered in with a challenge to divert his shot			0
similar frustration followed in the 34th minute when , after creating an opening , a right - footed drive was comfortably gathered by @entity156			1
he jogged around and tried to get involved			0
he shouted at the match officials when things never went his way but there was never the feeling that @entity37 , a @entity6 winner in his youth with @entity163 , was waiting to cast a spell in front of goal			1
just as nerves were beginning to fray and @entity147 started to sense an improbable result , @entity37 did what all the a-list performers do and came up with the goal to crack the tension			2
it was a fine finish too , showing poise under pressure			0
how his new crowd loved it , serenading him with the song ' @entity180 ! @entity181 ! @entity182 , ole ! @entity182 , ole ! ' if much of what had gone before was unconvincing , it no longer mattered			0
@entity37 was up and running			2
@entity2 fans are primed for a new goal scoring hero after the departure of @entity67 to @entity189 @entity37 ( r ) was guilty of missing several chances before finally finding the net at his new club @entity4 teammates prove what a popular figure @entity37 is after his strike gave them the lead a word of warning , though : for him to really become a success , he must work			1
he has to cover ground and make himself a nuisance and realise it is demanded that a @entity4 forward run himself to a standstill			2
all the greats did it			0
they all knew that hard work was a prerequisite			0
the system @entity15 plays demands a high tempo and for his players to press			0
that is when they are at the best and when the chances come			0
if nobody is doing that up front , the system fragments and @entity4 's potency suffers			2
@entity37 has the stage and the banner in homage to him on @entity2 shows how much the locals want him to succeed			1
the big question is how much @entity37 wants to make it happen			2
video we showed great resilience - @entity15			0
