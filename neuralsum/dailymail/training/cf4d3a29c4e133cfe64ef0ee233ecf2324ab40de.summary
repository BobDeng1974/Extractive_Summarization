while it was all smiles under the @entity4 roof , spirits were decidedly dampened elsewhere at the tournament as rain stopped play on all other courts for most of the day			1
and those sitting under umbrellas on @entity10 were angry to see rows of empty members ’ seats in the area directly behind the @entity15 during the tense match between @entity17 and @entity18			1
poor show : fans were left infuriated by the empty seats in the stands behind the @entity15 fans accused owners of the exclusive members ’ seats of ‘ not bothering to show up after a long lunch ’ as swathes of the stands were left unoccupied			1
it is perhaps the last place you would expect an umpire to live while working at the world ’s most prestigious tennis tournament			2
but @entity34 has been forced to stay in a campervan on @entity36 , after a friend she normally boards with had to cancel at the last minute			2
her temporary berth is just yards away from @entity41 ’s most expensive hotel , @entity42 , where suites during the tournament cost £ 1,000 a night			2
@entity34 , who has worked at @entity41 for 19 years , told @entity45 : ‘ i am making the best of it			2
’ later , @entity15 members were also criticised for not watching @entity50 ’s match			1
some fans had queued up overnight but failed to see almost any tennis because of the wet weather			1
@entity54 , 37 , a company director , from @entity55 , said : ‘ i think it ’s terrible			2
' the members ’ seats are the best seats in the house but the members can not even be bothered to fill them up			1
‘ meanwhile , you have thousands of people outside who would kill to watch a bit of tennis			2
' we have been queuing since 6am but because of the rain we have seen only 30 minutes of play			1
' i think the members need to think about how lucky they are to have these seats			1
tennis should be for the fans and not just for the elite			1
’ @entity76 , 60 , from @entity77 , said she could see only one person sitting in the @entity15 at the start of @entity50 ’s match against @entity81 and many more empty seats in the stands			1
she said : ‘ it was a shame that they did n’t open them up to people who were out here			2
there was one person in the @entity15 at the start			1
’ disappointing : rows were left empty as tennis stars @entity17 ( left ) and @entity50 played ms @entity76 has seen just 30 minutes of tennis before play was suspended on the outside courts and covers pulled over to protect the grass			1
@entity98 , 30 , had travelled from @entity99 to watch the tennis but had to content herself with watching the big matches on the screen			1
@entity103 , 76 , who has engraved the champions ’ names on to the silverware for 35 years , has owned up to a spelling error			0
in 2009 he used a ‘ v ’ instead of the ‘ w ’ in the name of @entity111 @entity110 , he admitted			0
‘ i ’m a bit disappointed watching @entity4 because there ’s lots of empty seats and we ’re all sitting here in rain , ’ she said			1
‘ i find that really annoying			0
’ a receptionist at the @entity122 ’ @entity123 confirmed the empty seats behind the @entity15 belonged to the @entity125 , adding : ‘ they were probably having a break from watching the tennis			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity130 did not comment			0
during the @entity17 match , sportsmen and women , who are traditionally invited there on @entity41 ’s middle saturday , were glued to the game			1
and @entity136 was happy to oblige a hat - trick of ladies with their camera phones during a break in play at @entity41 yesterday			1
@entity143 hat - trick : @entity136 poses for a photo with three adoring fans during a break at @entity41 today the old charmer – who brought mum @entity149 to the @entity15 on @entity4 – was at it again a little later as he and a female @entity152 officer seemed to be enjoying a chat about the weather			1
@entity136 and his mum sat just in front of another former @entity158 star , sir @entity157 , with his wife @entity159			1
injured @entity160 women ’s number one @entity163 may not be playing this year , but away from the court she has been enjoying an online flirtation with a young singer			0
the dalliance began when @entity168 , 21 , wrote a song and posted it on @entity170 asking @entity163 , 20 , for a @entity172 date			0
then earlier this month @entity163 agreed to attend one of @entity168 ’s gigs – at the famous @entity55 jazz bar , @entity176 – but had to pull out			0
@entity178 cycling gold medallist @entity177 , whose famous sideburns have morphed into a full beard , sat alongside his wife @entity181			1
fellow @entity178 cyclist @entity182 was also there with husband and former @entity186 trainer @entity185			0
others watching included : boxers @entity188 and @entity190 ; @entity192 captain @entity191 ; rower sir @entity193 , former @entity192 cricketer @entity194 , along with @entity195 and their partners ; @entity200 gold medallists @entity198 and @entity201 ; and retired @entity178 swimmer @entity202			2
meanwhile , prices for @entity4 tickets for tomorrow ’s matches , likely to include @entity207 ’s last - 16 match against @entity208 , were already sky - high last night			2
on website @entity210 tickets were being offered at up to £ 1,900 for a pair			0
pairs of tickets for the @entity215 on sunday were going for up to £ 6,500 , though prices are likely to soar further should @entity207 progress that far to defend his title			0
golden boy : @entity136 charms one of @entity41 's volunteer services personnel service personnel who volunteer as stewards at @entity41 have been threatened with the sack if they sit on unoccupied show court seats when they go off duty			1
the special force of 300 services personnel have also been banned by the @entity130 from taking courtside ‘ selfies ’ at the tournament			0
last night @entity232 members and tennis celebrities called on the club to reverse the decision			1
retired colonel @entity236 said : ‘ our troops give so much to defend our country , including the @entity130			0
in return , they should have the decency to let them have these seats			2
’ officially , workers at the tournament are not allowed to fill unoccupied show court seats but stewards used to turn a blind eye if members of the military took them			2
this year , however , @entity41 ’s team of civilian honorary stewards have been ordered to eject anyone from the @entity232 they catch sitting in the stands			0
one serviceman told @entity45 : ‘ they have been telling us to leave			0
it ’s particularly upsetting because we were told it was because it looked like we were skiving			0
‘ eventually our officers told us it was causing too much hassle and if we watched the games we would be sacked			0
’ another added : ‘ it ’s a shame because we ’ve given up two weeks of our leave to come here and volunteer			0
’ the volunteer added that military personnel have also been banned from taking selfies while working			0
’ col @entity236 added : ‘ this is one of the differences between @entity274 and @entity160 attitudes to their armed forces			0
this would never happen in the @entity274 , where so many organisations and individuals give special treatment to the troops			0
’ @entity281 , the mother of @entity282 and @entity283 , told @entity45 : ‘ we value our armed forces in @entity274 so i do n’t get why they ca n’t do it in @entity192			0
’ last night a spokesman for the club said off - duty staff had never been allowed to sit on a show courts and if it had happened in the past it was against the rules of the club			0
