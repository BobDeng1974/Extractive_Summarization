by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 14:27 est , 15 march 2013 the best thing about @entity2 is that it 's a free market			2
anyone can sell or buy whatever they please ( within reason )			2
and one artist , who goes by the name of thedoctorwhoguide2012 , is using the power of @entity2 to sell his intriguing artwork , many of which are line drawings of @entity16 stars in rather compromising states of undress			1
. a rudimentary sketch of @entity20 with no top on has already attracted bids up to £ 11 - and is still going strong - while a fully - clothed version is on offer for @entity25 of £ 5			2
a drawings of @entity28 star @entity27 is naif , but genuinely captures something of his character , while a sketch of @entity34 certainly has an element of the star 's confrontational gaze			0
pulling in the bids : a near naked sketch of @entity16 star @entity20 , on sale for £ 11 , has already received 16 bids , whilst a fully - clothed one ( r ) can be bought for £ 5 talent : drawings of @entity44 , aka @entity45 , top , and @entity34 , bottom , may be naif - but they capture something of the stars ' character it 's not only drawings the enterprising seller - who from his profile page appears to be a young man - has up for grabs either			1
from a pair of used @entity61 socks on sale for £ 1.99 to an authentic pebble from @entity65 beach for £ 4.99 , there is something for everyone			1
@entity69 fans will be pleased to know there are some uncanny sketches of both @entity72 and @entity73 currently available for under £ 5			1
but what will perhaps come as a surprise to the millions of @entity69 fans out there is that it is not @entity73 who is top of the pops in this arena			0
rather it is the near - naked drawings of @entity16 star @entity20 that are the most popular of all			1
at the time of writing , one such artwork had as many as 16 bids			0
speaking to the @entity89 , the seller said : ' i do all my drawings myself and they make exceedingly high amounts of money			0
' today i withdrew £ 140 from sales			0
character : a sketch of @entity97 can be bought now for £ 5.25 , while a rather good rendition of @entity99 that certainly captures his unique look has a buy it now price of just £ 5 that 'll come in use one day : a pebble from @entity65 beach is up for grabs for £ 4.99 , but do n't worry , post and packaging is free of charge cheesy : a second hand pair of @entity61 socks are on offer for £ 1.99 simple : a 100 - sheet pack of white copy paper is on sale for £ 4.25 , but you might be better off popping to your local @entity118 hygienic : a pair of fangs , clearly second - hand , can be snapped up for £ 3.69 on the seller 's page ; get your bids in before @entity127 @entity128 : a pretty pink comb , that comes unpackaged , can be purchased for £ 2.25 work of art : a delicate hand - painted bird picture is available for £ 5 one for the fans : some line drawn pictures of @entity72 and @entity73 from one direction are on offer			1
@entity73 's picture already has five bids so get your bid in fast a thing of beauty : @entity34 , who is known for being vain , probably would n't be impressed with the £ 4.35 sketch of him can you tell who it is yet ? it 's another @entity149 - this time old favourite @entity150 in her role as @entity152 visit the page of thedoctorwhoguide2012 to view all of the items on sale and to place a bid .			0
