he said : ' thoughts and images from the @entity4 still have an impact on how we experience reality			0

' in the new translation she is referred to instead as a ' young ' woman			0
the new translation of the @entity4 has even beaten the best - selling erotic novel @entity7 in @entity6 @entity6 's @entity70 promoted the new translation like a pop fiction novel , stirring anticipation by giving out teasers of biblical stories before its release			1

@entity116 , presiding bishop for the @entity75 , said the new version was easier to read			0
' there is no over-interpretation of the text			0
' it has sold nearly 160,000 copies and was @entity6 's best - selling book in 2012 , despite increasing secularisation as @entity6 have concentrated on other pursuits than religion			1
they skiing , hiking and other outdoor activities , leaving little time other than @entity131 or @entity132 to fill the pews			0
