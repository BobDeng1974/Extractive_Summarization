by @entity1 reporter published : 11:20 est , 24 november 2013 @entity3 : 13:47 est , 25 november 2013 if you 've been struggling to shift the last few stubborn pounds in the run - up to @entity6 , help could be at hand			0
@entity9 ' @entity8 have unveiled a new fat - burning laser called the @entity11 which claims to make a significant difference within four weeks			1
the laser treatment , which can whittle up to two inches off the waistline , is expected to be particularly popular with new mothers , many of whom are anxious to swap mummy tummies for a flat stomach like the @entity20			0
all gone : @entity21 of @entity22 shows off her flat stomach while playing volleyball during a visit @entity21 sparked headlines back in october when she showed off a noticeably trim stomach while joining young volleyball players at @entity29 at the former @entity30			1
shortly afterwards , it was revealed that demand for fat - busting treatments shot up in subsequent weeks , with one @entity35 clinic reporting a staggering 650 per cent rise			1
a spokesperson at the @entity39 clinic said : ' we started receiving an unprecedented number of calls last friday for tummy treatments and almost all were from mothers who had recently given birth			2
we normally make about 12 new bookings a week , but in less than two days we had 40			0
' the phone was ringing off the hook and there were quite a few bookings left on voicemail over the weekend and the bookings have continued at the rate of about 10 a day all through this week			0
' we usually ask callers what prompted them to seek out the treatment and on friday and over the weekend almost all said they wanted to get a flat stomach like @entity20 's			0
mummy tummy : like other new mothers , @entity20 showed a noticeably rounded stomach on leaving hospital before and after : after four weeks of using the vanquish machine , a slimmer figure ( right ) could be yours ' many said they had failed to get their initial figure back after three months - even with a good diet and fitness regime and now needed extra help to shift the stubborn fatty area around their midriff			2
' although fat freezing treatments have proved most popular , according to @entity8 , the new device can target bigger areas and should work well on wobbly tummies			1
the vanquish machine works by directing radiofrequency waves at problem areas which heats them up until they melt away			0
' this new procedure is a real game changer — it 's the safest , easiest way yet to remove fat , ' @entity86 , medical director at @entity8			2
' as the panels heat up , the radio frequency waves they transmit locate the fat cells which are denser and hold less water , and differentiate these from the skin and muscle cells			1
' the heat causes cell death in the fat cells ; some die instantly , some in a matter of weeks			1
' although the treatment lasts just 30 minutes , the spa say you need at least two sessions to see real results , which could prove costly - each session costs £ 500 .			0
