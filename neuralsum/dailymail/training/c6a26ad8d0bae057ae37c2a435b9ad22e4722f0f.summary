by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 10 january 2013 accused killer @entity2 kissed her new love interest and laughed with his friends just 24 hours after she stabbed and shot her ex-boyfriend to death in his shower , the man testified in court today			1
@entity10 testified in her murder trial in @entity12 on wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and phone calls with @entity15 after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008			1
he invited her to his home in @entity19 , @entity20 in june 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned , telling @entity10 she had got lost , driven the wrong way and slept in her car for a while , he said			1
in fact , she had spent the previous day with her former boyfriend , motivational speaker and insurance salesman @entity2 , at his @entity28 , @entity30 home as they had continued to have a sexual relationship			1
new love : @entity10 , left , testified that @entity2 , right , visited him at his @entity20 home 24 hours after she killed @entity2 - but she never mentioned the killing , despite claiming it was out of self defense ' obsessed ' : @entity15 , 32 , stabbed @entity2 , pictured , 27 times and shot him in the head five days later , @entity43 was found stabbed 27 times , his throat sliced and with a gun wound in his head			1
the prosecution has alleged that @entity15 , 32 , was obsessed with @entity43 and killed him after he revealed he wanted to start dating another girl			1
while at first denying that she had even seen him that day , @entity15 eventually claimed that she killed him in self defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their relationship			1
yet when she visited @entity10 the day after the murder , she never once mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day , he said in court			2
when she arrived at his home , @entity10 noticed that she had bandaged hands , but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job , he said			1
in court : @entity15 ' murder trial , pictured wednesday , is underway in @entity64 superior court in @entity12 testimony : @entity10 said they kissed and laughed with his friends soon after she arrived at his home in june 2008 they settled down to watch a film together - and soon got physical , he told the court			1
' at some point we were talking and we kissed , ' he said			0
' every time we started kissing it got a little more escalated			0
at some point she was kissing my neck , i was kissing hers , but our clothes never came off			0
' @entity10 said they resumed their kissing later that night when she climbed on top of him , but they stopped as he did not want her to regret the visit due to her @entity89 beliefs about sex			2
@entity10 , who is also a @entity89 , was unaware that just 24 hours earlier , she had been posing provocatively for photographs later found on her murdered ex-boyfriend 's camera			1
happier times : she met @entity2 , a @entity89 and motivational speaker , at a @entity100 conference suspect : @entity2 's friend and roommate who found his body in june 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that @entity2 had been stalking and threatening the man while she was confident with @entity10 , he said she became ' shy ' and a ' little awkward ' around his friends , but that she never acted as if anything more significant was wrong			1
' she was fine , she was laughing about simple little things like any other person , ' he said			0
i never once felt like anything was wrong during the day			0
' @entity10 said he did not know @entity15 was still seeing @entity43 when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other , @entity112 reported			1
the prosecution showed parts of their online conversations to the court , including a message where @entity15 told @entity10 she had ' trust issues ' with @entity43 and had been cheated on twice in the past			1
@entity125 ' testimony , which continues on wednesday afternoon , comes one day after @entity15 sobbed as prosecutors displayed images of the horrendous wounds she inflicted on @entity43			2
' last photo ' : among the images on the camera was this one showing @entity133 in the shower before his death possessive : the jury was shown a picture of @entity15 in a t - shirt @entity43 made reading ' @entity2 's ' she wiped away tears as the @entity64 medical examiner said @entity43 ' may have ' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty			2
if she did shoot @entity43 after he was already dead it could qualify as a ' heinous and depraved ' murder , which would more likely send her to death row in @entity30			0
yet the medical examiner said he could not be fully certain @entity43 was already dead from blood loss as the body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the killing			0
with the delicate brain tissue also decomposing , he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or how much hemorrhaging had occurred , which would signal whether @entity43 was still alive			0
the prosecution also showed images of @entity43 's bloody bathroom and bedroom after the killing			0
mess : prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder blood - soaked : another image shows blood stains on the carpet near his bathroom in his bedroom others showed defensive slash wounds on @entity43 's hands , sustained when he tried to fight back , and grazes on his legs , suggesting his body was later dragged			0
they also displayed images found on @entity43 's camera , which included sexually explicit images of the pair , photos of him in the shower moments before his death			0
in a bizarre twist , the camera also contained images of @entity43 after the murder and a picture of @entity15 dragging his body - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped			2
@entity43 was found dead in his home in suburban @entity28 on june 9 , 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days			0
' killer ' : she stands accused of stabbing and shooting @entity2 to death at his home in 2008 grief : @entity2 's sisters refuse to look at the images of the body in the trial on tuesday @entity15 originally claimed she had not seen @entity43 the day of his murder , before claiming she had seen two men kill him , before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense			1
the couple had met at a work conference in @entity100 in september 2006 and began speaking on the phone every day			0
court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 emails			0
they started dating in february 2007 and , because @entity43 was a @entity89 , @entity15 chose to be baptized into the church			2
but they broke up in june 2007 , with @entity15 telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame .			2
