by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 09:17 est , 15 september 2013 judges at one of @entity4 ’s largest courts were forced to apologise for adjourning trials because teenage gang members were touring the cells below			1
the sentencing of several criminals had to be aborted amid farcical scenes at @entity11 this week when young offenders were invited to take a look at the custody suites			1
the tour was part of a community scheme to deter ‘ high - risk ’ teenagers involved in , or at the risk of , gang crime , from further offending			1
farce : courts were forced to rise at 4pm at @entity11 this week when young offenders were invited to take a look at the custody suites but there was outrage that courtrooms were disrupted and sentencing of serious offenders halted at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of thousands of pounds just to show a group of teenage thugs around			1
custody cases at the court were postponed on monday after a dozen teenagers from the @entity39 area of @entity40 were invited			2
the visit , which happened during normal court hours , meant there would be nowhere to put the defendants if they were jailed			1
but only two youngsters turned up for the anti-gang initiative planned by @entity47 and the police			2
@entity11 , which is the fourth - largest crown court in @entity4 with 15 courtrooms , costs a minimum of £ 42,000 a day per defendant to run			1
@entity53 , chief executive of the @entity54 ’ @entity55 , said yesterday : ‘ taxpayers will be appalled that this court visit for gang members interfered with the dispensing of justice , causing considerable disruption and incurring additional costs			1
the young gang members were given a tour of the cells , which forced the courts to abort sentencings and hearings ( file photo ) ‘ regardless of the merits of the visit , @entity47 should have organised it for a time when the court was not sitting so that important hearings were not interrupted			1
’ at least two cases were adjourned			2
in one case , there was uproar when the judge announced he would have to adjourn midway through the hearing			1
judge @entity81 had risen to consider the fate of two fraudsters in a £ 4.5million scam when suddenly he announced that the defendants and their relatives would have to come back the following day			1
@entity87 , 38 , and his cousin @entity88 , 42 , were facing years behind bars for persuading scores of vulnerable victims to hand over their life savings in a £ 4.5million wine investment scam			0
but having already heard mitigation , judge @entity81 said he could not continue			0
@entity88 sobbed and @entity87 appeared shocked while angry family and friends in the packed court room bellowed ‘ you must be joking ’			2
judge @entity81 said : ‘ because of an event that is taking place involving the cells in this building , all courts have been asked to rise at 4pm			2
‘ i have to express real regret this has occurred			0
’ @entity87 was jailed for seven and a half years the next day , while @entity88 , a former employee of accountancy giant @entity107 , was locked up for three years			0
the sentencing of a woman police officer for exchanging more than 1,000 calls and texts with her jailed lover , @entity113 , was also adjourned			0
@entity113 shouted : ‘ f * * * that , man			0
i ’m not coming back tomorrow			0
they can do it by video link – i ’m not coming back , bruv			0
’ the hearing resumed the next day when @entity113 , currently serving an extended sentence for armed robbery , was given five months in prison , while his @entity124 lover @entity123 received a suspended prison sentence			0
a spokesman for @entity47 said the event had been planned in advance to ensure minimal disruption			0
the council hailed the initiative as a success , saying several ‘ high - risk individuals ’ had taken the first steps to changing their lifestyle .			0
