by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:00 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 21:55 est , 25 february 2014 a day after arguing for deep budget cuts to @entity1 's military , the @entity5 administration has told the @entity8 to prepare for a 100 per cent withdrawal from @entity10			1
@entity5 has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war - torn nation by year 's end , but tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly that would completely void @entity10 of @entity1 personnel who have been vital in fighting @entity21 militias			1
' president @entity5 has asked the @entity8 to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the @entity1 not keep any troops in @entity10 after 2014 , ' the @entity22 said tuesday morning			1
that message was part of a phone call between @entity5 and @entity10 leader @entity33 on tuesday , during which the @entity1 president reportedly pressured him to accept the terms of a @entity35 ( @entity36 ) that has been pending for months			1
the @entity5 administration has made the agreement , drafted in november , a requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in @entity33 's country after the larger @entity1 pullout is complete			1
scroll down for @entity42 @entity5 may be playing a game of chicken with @entity33 , designed to force the @entity10 leader 's hand before he passes off power later this year @entity21 insurgents continue to rain destruction on @entity10 's cities and villages , continuing the @entity53 's quest to deploy just the right amount of muscle in response sad sack ? @entity8 chief @entity57 had to tell reporters on monday that @entity1 military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940 @entity33 has been putting off the decision to sign the @entity36 , saying that it should be left for his successor			1
elections will be held in april to choose the next president			0
but that process could drag on for months since @entity10 's presidential election process is a two - stage system that may not be complete until july or august			0
a @entity8 source told @entity70 that existing @entity8 plans call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind , split between training forces and special operators equipped to raid @entity21 strongholds			0
but those plans are fluid			0
and since so many @entity79 allies in @entity10 depend on @entity1 troops for logistical support and just - in - time war materiel , those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear nod from the @entity1			1
and @entity5 's decision is already limiting the choices of a @entity79 panel of defense ministers meeting this week in @entity89 , @entity90			1
the @entity79 group is weighing how many troops to place in @entity10 next year , and the political tug - of - war between @entity94 and @entity95 promises to wreak havoc with those plans			2
if @entity33 's successor is n't in place until the end of the summer , the @entity8 source cautioned , @entity79 will find itself in a time crunch with just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions			1
@entity10 president @entity33 wants to pass the decision about an @entity1 security agreement to his successor , but that may leave a @entity1 - dependent @entity79 with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments @entity1 troops are a common sight -- for now -- in @entity95 , where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing most of the major - party contenders for the @entity10 presidency have spoken in favor of the @entity1 agreement , but @entity79 generals and the @entity8 do n't want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain outcome of a @entity123 election			1
' we will leave open the possibility of concluding a @entity36 with @entity10 later this year , ' the @entity22 said tuesday			0
ouch : former vice president @entity126 said tuesday that president @entity5 would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military ' however , the longer we go without a @entity36 , the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any @entity1 mission			2
furthermore , the longer we go without a @entity36 , the more likely it will be that any post- 2014 @entity1 mission will be smaller in scale and ambition			0
' @entity33 has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the @entity1 has withdrawn platoon after platoon			0
but the @entity8 knows that he ca n't run for the top post again			0
his war of words with @entity5 may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another â€“ the worst circumstance for @entity5 's latest move if it 's just an @entity146 bluff			2
the @entity8 , however , insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the @entity79 meeting in @entity90 , where secretary of state @entity57 will represent @entity1 interests			2
' without question , the issues surrounding the future of the @entity10 mission will certainly be discussed in @entity89 , to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all allies , ' @entity8 press secretary @entity152 told @entity160			2
' we long said that we would like a @entity36 as soon as possible			0
absent that , ' he vowed , ' we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year			0

@entity5 told his @entity10 *counterpart* that if he does n't sign a @entity35 , all the @entity1 troops in his country could *vanish*
the move might be a *colossal* bluff since it 's timed with a @entity79 defense ministerial where 2015 troop deployment decisions could be made
but @entity5 has already *shaken* up the military with a @entity8 *announcement* that @entity178 troop levels will be cut down to @entity180 levels
and *additional* budget *slashing* *announced* monday *suggests* that the president is serious about limiting the role of @entity1 might *abroad*
