by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 13 november 2013 the immense ash clouds that erupted from @entity4 ’s @entity3 volcano in 2010 caused chaos for the airline industry			2
no one really knew if it would be safe to fly , and technology to accurately detect the plumes of ash had yet to be developed			2
since then , @entity12 has been working on a system known as @entity14 ( @entity15 and @entity16 ) that it claims will prevent ash clouds disrupting flights			1
in the test , an @entity30 plane dispersed one tonne of @entity4 ash into the atmosphere at between 9,000ft and 11,000ft			0
this created conditions consistent with the 2010 eruption of the @entity4 volcano @entity3			0
a second @entity30 test aircraft , an @entity39 , with the avoid technology fitted , flew towards the ash cloud identifying and measuring it from around 40 miles away			1
an @entity30 plane released a cloud of ash as part of test to see how passenger aircraft can cope with volcanic eruptions from inside the @entity30 test aircraft , @entity4 ash was extracted then dispersed into the atmosphere as part of the avoid system testing the avoid system uses infra - red technology that allows pilots to see the damaging ash plumes up to 62 miles ahead between 5,000 and 50,000 ft. the system shows images of ash to aircrew , allowing them to change flight path			1
the images are also sent back to ground control where data from different aircraft can help create a detailed ash cloud map			1
the experiment also used a small aircraft , a @entity71 from @entity72 in @entity73 , to fly into the ash cloud to take measurements which help to corroborate the measurements made by the @entity14 system			1
the ash cloud produced during the test was between 600ft and 800ft deep measuring about 1.75 miles in diameter			1
to begin with the ash cloud was visible to the naked eye but dissipated quickly , becoming difficult to identify			2
the avoid system uses infra - red technology that allows pilots to see the damaging ash plumes up to 62 miles ahead at between 5,000 and 50,000 ft. @entity14 detected the ash cloud and measured its density which showed that it was within the range of concentrations measured during the ash crisis in april and may 2010			1
dr @entity90 who invented avoid volcanic technology is shown with the original detector at the @entity30 factory in @entity94 , @entity95 during the testing , the avoid volcanic sensor detected the artificial ash cloud and measured its density ‘ the threat from @entity4 volcanoes continues and so we are delighted with the outcome of this unique and innovative experiment , ’ said @entity12 ’s engineering director @entity99			1
‘ finding a solution is as crucial now as ever to ensure we never again see the scenes of spring 2010 when all flying ceased across @entity107 for several days			0
’ @entity12 said it is now working towards a non-integrated stand - alone system which its aim to fit on to a number of its current fleet of aircraft by the end of next year			1
dr @entity90 , inventor of the @entity14 technology , said : ‘ the team has just executed a unique scientific and engineering experiment conclusively demonstrating that low concentrations of ash can be identified by the @entity14 sensor			2
‘ @entity122 clouds that erupted from @entity4 's @entity3 volcano in 2010 caused chaos for airliners a second @entity30 test aircraft , an @entity39 , with the avoid technology fitted , flew towards the ash cloud identifying and measuring it from around 40 miles away @entity30 engineering head @entity130 added : ‘ we are at the beginning of an invention which could become a useful solution for commercial aviation to prevent large - scale disruption from volcanic ash			1
’ explosive volcanic eruptions in @entity4 happen on average once every five years			0
when winds blow from the north west , the ash is transported towards @entity107 as it did during the @entity3 eruption in 2010			0
‘ it was a coincidence that this did not happen in the seven explosive eruptions that took place between 1970 and 2010			0
instead the ash was mostly carried away from @entity107 by southerly winds , ’ said @entity144 , from the @entity145 in @entity4			0
‘ considering the relatively long time since the last eruptions in two of @entity4 ’s most active volcanoes , @entity156 and @entity157 , both should be regarded as ready to erupt			0
‘ it is not possible to predict when or where the next eruption will take place			0
what is certain is that it will happen			0
’ explosive volcanic eruptions in @entity4 happen on average once every five years			0
pictured is an ash cloud from the volcano @entity3 this graphic reveals which flight paths were affected by the volcanic ash cloud in 2010			2

@entity14 uses infra - red which allows pilots to see ash plumes 62 miles ahead
system shows images of ash to aircrew , allowing them to change course
images are also sent back to ground control to create an ash cloud map
@entity12 aims to fit avoid systems on a number of its aircraft by 2015
