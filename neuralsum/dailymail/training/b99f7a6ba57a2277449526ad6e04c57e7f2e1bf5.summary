by @entity0 a wild beaver which is one of the first to be seen in @entity3 for centuries has given birth to three young			1
two adult beavers , one juvenile and the three young , known as kits , are now believed to be living in the @entity10 in @entity11			1
the beavers were originally found to be living in the east @entity11 river in july last year when dog walker @entity14 , 35 , spotted one swimming around			1
two adult beavers were first spotted in the river in july last year by dogwalker @entity14 after being spotted last year , retired environmental scientist @entity22 set up three infra - red cameras to film the beavers , which led to the recent discovery that one had given birth to three young ( above ) following the sighting , retired environmental scientist @entity22 set up three infra - red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river			1
he has caught them on camera several times since january and they have been filmed grooming themselves , gnawing at the base of trees and happily playing together			0
the government had originally said the beavers would be rehomed , as they could be carrying a disease , but wildlife campaigners now hope to get permission for them to stay			2
mr @entity22 , who discovered the beavers had mated after spotting the young on his latest footage , said : ‘ i was so excited to see the female and the kit			1
‘ our baby beavers have been born free and their freedom should not be taken away by imprisoning them in a zoo			0
‘ i 'd be extremely disappointed if the government did that			0
’ @entity57 said it was working to get a licence from @entity59 for the ‘ non-native species ’ to remain on the river			1
campaigners are trying to get a licence from @entity59 for the ' non-native species ' to stay on the river experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection , rather than being released deliberately sightings of the animals in the @entity10 were believed to be the first of their kind for 800 years			1
their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries			0
beavers were once common throughout @entity3 but were hunted to extinction in @entity59 and @entity81 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur , meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal ’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure			1
the ast few @entity3 beavers were hunted to extinction during the 16th century			2
to return the creatures to the @entity3 , conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from @entity94			0
between may 2009 and september 2010 , the @entity95 released four family groups and one pair of beavers into @entity99 , @entity100			0
more recently , beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at @entity105 and @entity106 - but none are unaccounted for and the @entity10 beavers are thought to have escaped from a private collection			2
they remained in @entity111 but disappeared from the @entity3 completely 400 years ago			2
experts think the beavers in the @entity10 most likely escaped from a private collection , rather than being released deliberately			2
the @entity114 said the government was taking ‘ precautionary actions ’ amid fears the animals could be carrying a disease ‘ not currently present in the @entity3 ’			2
‘ we are taking precautionary action by testing the beavers , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ this will be done with their welfare in mind			0
’ he added the department would wait until the kits were a suitable age before testing them for disease			0
there are two species of beaver - the @entity137 and @entity138			0
@entity14 first spotted the wild beaver in the @entity10 last july and managed to take a photo ( above ) in recent months , the beavers have been filmed grooming themselves , gnawing trees and playing together the adult beavers and their young have been living beside the @entity10 in @entity11 since at least july last year the @entity137 is considered ‘ vulnerable ’ and is extinct in most of @entity145 , with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from @entity148 to the @entity150 and @entity151 borders			1
there were several attempts to breed @entity138 and @entity137 beavers to boost numbers of the @entity137 species , until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible			0
conservationists have since introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the @entity3 , but this is thought to be the first group found living in the wild .			1

beavers living in @entity10 , @entity11 were first to be seen in @entity3 in 800 years
adult has given birth to three young meaning whole family now live in river
@entity22 has *regularly* photographed animals using infrared cameras
@entity57 working to get licence for ' non-native species ' to stay
