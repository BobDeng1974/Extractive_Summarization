by @entity0 not everyone would want to come across praying mantises , which are known for their cannibalistic tendencies , in the woods			0
but one biologist has identified 19 new species of a tree - living praying mantis family in forests around the world , tripling the group 's diversity at a stroke			1
the bark mantises ( @entity16 ) from @entity17 and @entity18 were found in tropical forests and among specimens kept in museums - and one of them has been named after former @entity25 vice-president @entity24			1
one biologist has identified 19 new species of a tree - living praying mantis family in tropical forests as well as in museums , tripling the group 's diversity at a stroke			1
@entity32 , one of the new species found in a dense @entity35 rain forest is pictured nineteen new species of the bark mantis family were found in tropical rainforests in @entity17 and @entity18 as well as in museum collections			1
@entity40 are fast runners that live on the trunks and branches of trees			1
they are active hunters and pursue their prey , unlike some other mantis species that prefer to lie in wait and ambush other insects			2
@entity40 are not thought to engage in cannibalism			0
they are highly camouflaged and evade predators by running to the opposite side of their tree - a tactic also adopted by many tree - dwelling lizards			0
this shows they constantly monitor their environment and take action accordingly			0
some species leap off a tree trunk to avoid capture and even play dead			0
one of the newly - discovered species is called @entity67 and another , @entity68 , which was captured in a dense rain forest along the @entity35 in northern @entity70 , is named after former @entity25 vice-president @entity24			2
many of the newly described species are known only from a few specimens collected before 1950 from locations that have been destroyed or irrevocably changed by agriculture or urban development			2
‘ based on this study , we can predict that mantis groups with similar habitat specialisation in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 will also be far more diverse than what is currently known ’ said dr @entity77 , curator of invertebrate zoology at the @entity79 in the @entity25 ‘ many of these groups have never been studied other than by the scientists that originally described some of the species , which in some cases is more than 100 years ago			1
‘ this is exciting because enormous potential exists for advancing our understanding of praying mantis diversity just by looking within our existing museum collections and conducting a few field expeditions , ’ he explained			0
dr @entity77 searched for the insects in eight countries in @entity104 and studied hundreds of specimens from 25 museums in @entity107 , @entity18 and @entity108 to make the finds			1
@entity110 , a new species of praying mantis named after former @entity25 vice-president @entity24 , was captured in a dense rain forest along the @entity35 in northern @entity70 , but other specimens were identified among museum collections collected over a century ago many of the newly described species are known only from a few specimens collected before 1950 from locations that have been destroyed or irrevocably changed by agriculture or urban development			2
one of the species has been named after @entity122 laureate @entity24 ( pictured ) , who is a prominent climate change activist @entity40 are fast runners that live on the trunks and branches of trees			1
contrary to the common perception of mantises being slow , methodical ambush experts , the insects are active hunters that pursue their prey			0
also unlike some other mantis species , they are not believed to engage in @entity135 are highly camouflaged and evade predators by running to the opposite side of their tree - a tactic also adopted by many tree - dwelling lizards			0
‘ this is an amazing behaviour for an insect because it shows that they are not only relying on camouflage like most insects but are constantly monitoring their environment and taking action to run and hide , ’ said dr @entity77			1
‘ in addition , some species leap off the tree trunk to avoid capture and play dead after fluttering down to the forest floor since none of the species are strong fliers , ’ he said			0
the new species are described in the latest edition of the online open access journal @entity161 .			0
