in one letter , @entity8 tells @entity12 : ' whenever i think of home or you , it always makes tears come into my eyes and i am not the only one here by a long way			1
' you would be surprised to see some of our most toughest of fellows break down when we talk about home			0

' in another letter , young @entity8 enclosed a brooch , telling @entity12 : ' i hope you will like it and wear it for me my darling			1

he said : ' a friend of my daughter was exploring her newly - purchased house in @entity74 , @entity29 , and in the attic she found a rusty tin box			0
' @entity77 was a bundle of about 150 letters and postcards , in their original envelopes			0
' a quick look at some of the contents revealed them to be the correspondence between a @entity29 soldier and his sweetheart , written between 1914 and 1916			0
one of the letters discovered in an attic after being hidden for almost a century ' the soldier , @entity8 , lived in @entity91 , @entity29 , and his girlfriend , @entity12 , lived in the house where the letters were found			1
' most of the letters were written whilst @entity8 was in training in various camps in @entity99			2
only the last few were sent whilst he was on active service in @entity20			2

mr @entity63 , a former museum curator , said : ' up until august 1914 , @entity8 would not have had a clue about the possibility of becoming a soldier - he was probably thinking of a life with @entity12			1
mr @entity63 said : ' it 's sad , knowing what happened , to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life ' ' all of a sudden people were joining up and i think he had difficulty joining up because he was rather short			0

' there are several monologues which are quite witty			0
there are also some quite funny little jokes			0
he also teases his girlfriend and she teases him back about her becoming a conductor on the trams			0
' her final letter to @entity8 was returned with a note on the envelope which simply , heartbreakingly , said : ' died in hospital before letter received			1
' ' one hopes that she had already heard from @entity8 's father before she received that , ' says mr @entity63			2
it is thought that @entity8 had hoped to marry his sweetheart on his return from @entity20 - as he had sent her a ring gauge so she could tell him her wedding finger measurement			1

' it 's sad , knowing what happened , to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life , ' the historian said			0
' the letters end in 1916 and they were wrapped in a newspaper reporting his death			2
' he added that the story was that of the courtship of two typical working class people			0
