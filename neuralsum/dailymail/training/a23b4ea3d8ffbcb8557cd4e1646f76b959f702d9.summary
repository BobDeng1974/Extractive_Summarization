just days after staff at a @entity2 @entity1 were berated by a disgustingly rude customer , a man has been caught on tape delivering a vicious spray of abuse to a poor @entity9 's drive - thru cashier because someone put cheese in his hamburger			1
the footage shows the belligerent customer banging the ledge outside a drive - thru window aggressively with his fist as he yells at the attendant , who , while not visible in the video , is sure to be a third of his age			1
' i need my money back and i want it fast , ' the angry man screams			2
' is there cheese in hamburger ? there is no cheese in hamburger			2
when you have a cheeseburger you have a cheeseburger , when you have hamburger you have a hamburger			2
' i want my money back , i want it back now and i want it fast , ' the vile man continues , getting increasingly worked up at the cashier who almost certainly did n't make his meal			1
' there 's not even bacon on this , or onion on this , there 's not anything that i asked for			0
this is such incompetence and it happens every time i come here			0
' when the worker appears to try to calm him down , the man barks , again banging his fists in a threatening manner : ' i am losing my s * * * because this happened the past three times i 've come			2
please be competent for once in your life			0
take an order and fill it			0
' he is then given back his money , as requested , and the attendant quickly shuts the window , probably fearing a punch in the face			0
but even then the customer is not content			2
' ... damn it , i paid more than this , i want ten bucks you g * * damn sons of b * * * * es , g * * damn sons of b * * * * es , ' he yells before storming off into the night			0
threatening : the poor cashier , who is probably a teenager and almost certainly did n't make the man 's meal , is dished a vicious spray of abuse @entity9 's : the incident occurred at a @entity9 , thought it 's unclear where it was located @entity47 praised the poor @entity9 's staff in a comment underneath the video , which has garnered more than 55,000 views since it was uploaded on june 13			1
' props to the hard working folks at @entity9 for showing restraint when this whack job loses his mind over a wrong order , ' he said			0
the disgusting behavior comes hot on the heels of 27 - year - old @entity113 's disgraceful tirade			1
the @entity115 woman filmed herself abusing @entity1 employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice			1
@entity113 , however , only succeeds in appearing rude , ignorant and racist in the video , which she posted on her @entity123 page			1
the imagined slight occurred the night prior , when a @entity1 employee apparently forgot to print @entity113 's receipt			1
in what @entity113 seems to have construed as a mortal insult , the employee offered @entity113 her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight			2
hamburger : the customer is right , there is no cheese in @entity9 's hamburger , pictured cheeseburger : but there is cheese in the restaurant 's cheeseburger , pictured this more than generous offer apparently boiled @entity113 's blood , and she entered the fast food outlet the next day armed with a camera phone and a bad attitude			1
to the credit of @entity1 staff , they are unfailingly polite to @entity113 , despite the insults , swearing and racial slurs spat at them			1
in between orders of bacon and cheese croissants ( bacon extra crispy ) , iced coffee with extra cream and extra sugar and a @entity161 , which @entity113 mistakenly thinks the workers have forgotten			1
the eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with @entity113 warning the male employee who serves her , ' this is all being under video surveillance , ok ? ' she then tells him her complaint : that a female employee the night before forgot to print out her receipt and then ' turned into a complete rude b * tch '			1
she neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though			0
' she told me , ok , you can get your order free next time			0
so you know what i told her ? i want the whole f * * * * n ' menu , b * * * h. twice			0
' poor worker : the @entity1 employee , right , gracefully puts up with demands and insults from @entity113 , left according to @entity113 , her lawyer is ' already on it ' and she says she 'd spoken to someone from the store earlier that day who told her she could have her order free			1
the employee explains that he does n't know what happened the night before but reassures @entity113 he 's happy to give her what she wants			1
she begins to order , asking for the @entity198 , which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before			0
@entity113 tells a fellow customer , ' i just want my bacon crispy and my people nice , you know ? ' ' cos i literally thought this was the best one in the city , and i gave you guys so many good , like , remarks online because i have a business degree and , like , i really did until that b * * * h just completely p * * * * d me off , ' she explains , reasonably			1
@entity113 attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video , but they are n't forthcoming			1
' that 's your issue , ' says one man			2
' i 've got my own issues			0
' a receipt ai n't one , though , as he tells @entity113 that he is always given his receipt at @entity1			1
' i 'm from @entity222 in @entity223 , ' @entity113 tells the man , ' and up there this s * * t does n't happen , ' she says , but goes on to mention that ' one time they p * ssed in my fries where i 'm from at home			1
literally i could smell the p * ss. ' viral : before making her obscene @entity1 video , @entity113 's @entity46 channel was devoted to marketing videos , including this one for @entity235 ' so i know they 're probably sh * ttin ' and p * ssin in it , because they really do n't give a sh * t , ' she says loudly			1
' that 's why i 'm not eating this food , i 'm giving it to my boyfriend			0
' the worst is yet to come , though , when @entity113 spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before			2
' well , guess what ? this s * * t ’s about to go live , b * * * h. right on @entity123 , ' she rants			0
' cause i already posted what your dumb ass did last night			0
so i hope you ’re happy with your little f * * * * g sand n * * * * r self			0
cause i ’m about to nuke your whole f * * * * g planet from @entity257			0
you think ya ’ll are tough big fat @entity259 bombin ’ the @entity260 ? i ’ll show you tough , ' she yells to the woman , who calmly goes about her business behind the counter			0
@entity113 's @entity267 profile says she 's currently the marketing manager for @entity268 , but according to @entity270 the company says she has n't worked there for more than a year			2
@entity113 , whose @entity267 profile says she went to @entity273 in @entity274 , also has a @entity46 channel on which she has posted numerous marketing videos of low production quality			2
expressing her excitement at posting the video , she says , ' @entity281 , this is what you have to do in life , it f * * * * * g sucks			0
blow my brains out , ' a sentiment shared by many who have seen the video .			0

the vile man curses , points and bangs his fists as he abuses the drive - thru cashier who is n't visible in the video
the customer claims there was cheese in his hamburger and he is not happy about it
the footage was recorded by someone behind the angry customer in the drive - thru line
the appalling display comes after @entity2 woman @entity113 made a ' surveillance video ' of herself berating employees at @entity1
