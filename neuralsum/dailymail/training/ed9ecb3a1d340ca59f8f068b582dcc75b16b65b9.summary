gcse grades should be scrapped and replaced with points scores , according to the influential organisation that operates @entity4 ’s three exam boards			1
the current system needs to be replaced because it creates ‘ arbitrary ’ categories that conceal the true level of a pupil ’s achievement , said @entity10			0
candidates can have quite different marks but end up with the same grade , while others with similar marks are awarded different grades			1
gcse boards say the current system needs to be replaced because it creates ' arbitrary ' categories that conceal the true level of a pupil ¿ s achievement schools also end up focusing on the grade c boundary to improve their standing in league @entity24 , a research arm of the university which operates @entity27 , @entity4 @entity28 and @entity29 , said the system should be based on a numerical scale			1
it ruled out using a ‘ narrow ’ system based on a percentage in favour of a more accurate scale which ‘ could range from 600 to 900 points ’			0
‘ grades are arbitrary categories imposed on an underlying continuum of achievement , ’ said @entity38 , director of assessment research and development			1
‘ scale scores ... could reduce some of the undesirable effects in schools of extra effort being concentrated on pupils around the grade @entity49			1
this would lead to better teaching and learning			0
’ @entity38 , @entity4 's director of assessment research and development the @entity57 welcomed the proposal yesterday but had reservations about an ‘ over-complex ’ system that parents and employers would struggle to understand			1
chairman @entity63 said : ‘ their instincts are correct but we need a simple score like a percentage that is precise but simple enough for everyone to understand			0
’ however , education expert professor @entity70 , from the @entity71 , warned exact scores were meaningless as exams are not a precise form of measuring academic ability			0
he added : ‘ the other reason [ to keep grades ] is everybody is used to @entity79 , so there is no real point in changing the currency unless there is a compelling reason to do so			1
’ the @entity10 proposal involves adding up marks from each paper in a gcse subject and converting them into a points score			1
to understand the final score , examples could be provided of the types of questions pupils are able to answer , based on their performance			0
alternatively , the scores could be compared to the grade system it had replaced , the report said			2
but mr @entity63 said : ‘ if you try linking it with the previous exam you muddy the waters			2
‘ we need a clean break from the current gcses which are discredited because of grade inflation			2
’ a spokesman for exam regulator @entity109 said : ‘ we will be consulting soon on proposals for the regulatory arrangements for the new gcses and this will include considerations of how they should be graded			2
‘ we welcome all contributions to the debates of these important aspects of the qualifications			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity123 exam board said : ‘ this is an important debate			0
at a time of major changes to qualifications it is right that we consider how best to present the results of students ’ hard work so that they can be understood and used in the wider world			0
