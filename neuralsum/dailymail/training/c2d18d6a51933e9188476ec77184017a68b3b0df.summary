@entity0 lets it slip it was n’t just shots @entity0 was dropping as he let a big f - bomb go at the second — swearing loud enough for broadcasters to pick it up after another rotten drive			1
but @entity8 was in trouble for keeping quiet as the big - hitter failed to shout fore after a wayward shot at the same hole			2
frustrated : @entity0 let a big f - bomb go on the second hole at @entity16 butt of the joke it is tradition for the previous year ’s winner to choose the menu for the @entity22			1
@entity25 @entity24 ’s menu included a ‘ @entity26 — @entity27 being a barbecue seasoning			0
the choice was presumably inspired by last year ’s celebration , during which he was photographed patting his wife ’s rear end			0
steady on : @entity35 's @entity22 included a @entity36 ’ @entity37 @entity38 ’s busy day @entity39 took time off from his commentating duties with @entity41 to shoot a highly respectable 70			1
but after a quick shower it was straight into the studio for @entity45 , 51 , who said : ‘ i wanted to represent the @entity46 well and 70 is ok to start with			0
i drove the ball well and knew if i did that i could get round			0
’ busy man : @entity39 completed his round of 70 then rushed back to commentate for @entity50 @entity52 ’s @entity51 ! @entity53 was all smiles and he had plenty to ‘ ho , ho , ho ’ about after making @entity57 dress like @entity58 for the first round			1
@entity57 lost @entity61 's par - three challenge to his pal over the first three majors of the year and the forfeit was that he had to wear a outfit selected by @entity53 — hence @entity57 sporting grey beard , white top and red trousers			1

@entity72 : @entity57 's forced apparel of red trousers , white top and white beard @entity77 he may be ranked 18 in the world , but @entity80 ’s form in majors this year reads tied fifth , tied second and tied second			2

eye on the price : @entity80 looks set to challenge at a major again @entity87 @entity0 had them growling and there were plenty of roars for @entity92 but one of the warmest welcomes from the gallery was for @entity95 captain @entity94 at the first hole			1
the 64 - year - old , whose best finish in the @entity100 @entity99 was second in 1978 , responded by splitting the fairway with his drive — which led to even greater cheers			0
big crowd : legend @entity94 appreciated the support of the fans at the @entity99 on friday			0
