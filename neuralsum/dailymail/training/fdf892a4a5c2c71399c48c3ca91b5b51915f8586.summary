by @entity0 if you feel like you need a personal assistant to run your life , @entity1 claims to have the answer			2
its ‘ self - learning ’ car monitors your lifestyle and even predicts your next move , from the daily school run to that long - overdue trip to the gym			0
the mobile pa and life coach can also become so used to your schedule that it can interrogate your electronic diary to see what ’s coming up - and prepare you for it			0
@entity1 's intelligent technology will be used in future models			1
it works by recognising the driver from their smartphone or similar device ( pictured )			1
this means that by the time the driver opens the door , the car has already set the mirrors , steering wheel and seat , and interior temperature as a result of past actions and future appointments , for example , it can warn drivers to fill - up with petrol ahead of a school run , or will suggest they make an important phone call while on the move			1
@entity1 ’s intelligent technology will be used in future models and works by recognising the driver by their smartphone			1
features include : computer software in the system not only recognises the driver and learns their habits , it can then predict their routine and changing preferences			0
it will even check a calendar in advance and remind owners to take their child ’s sports kit to sports day			0
@entity1 ’s intelligent technology will be used in future models and works by recognising the driver from their smartphone or other device			1
it then uses the information it gleans to tee them up for the day			0
this means that by the time the driver has opened the door , the car has already set the mirrors , steering wheel and seat , and interior temperature to the individual ’s own preferences			1
it ’s also smart enough to change the temperature if it is snowing or raining			1
@entity1 showcased its @entity86 technology earlier today at its engineering centre in @entity88 , @entity89			1
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the self - learning car will also know if you are going to the gym , and will have learnt that you prefer a certain temperature on the way there to warm - up , and a different temperature to cool down on your way home			2
' if you always use the massage function at a particular time or location on a journey , the car will be able to predict this as well			0
’ he added : ‘ if you are taking the children to school , the car will recognise every passenger and offer each their own preferred music , video or radio options			0
‘ if you usually make a phone call at a certain time or on a particular journey , the car will predict this and will offer to make the call			0
if you are going to be late for your next appointment , the car will offer to email or call ahead with minimal or no interaction from the driver			0
‘ computer software in the system not only recognises the driver and learns their habits , it can then predict their routine and changing preferences			0
it will even check a calendar in advance and remind owners to take their child 's sports kit to sports day , or make an important phone call ( pictured ) it also learns an individual ’s driving style in a range of traffic conditions and on different types of road so the car can apply these ‘ learned ’ and preferred distance settings and acceleration habits			0
@entity1 ’s director of research and technology dr @entity156 added : ‘ up until now most self - learning car research has only focussed on traffic or navigation prediction			1
' we want to take this a significant step further and our new learning programme means information learnt about you will deliver a completely personalised driving experience and enhance driving pleasure			0
’ dr @entity156 continued : ‘ this is important because in the future customers will still want an emotional connection and a thrilling drive - with the ability to drive autonomously when required			0
’ @entity1 also unveiled its virtual windscreen that uses the entire screen as a display so the driver 's eyes need never leave the road			1
drivers on a racetrack could have ' ghost cars ' projected onto the screen which they could then race ( pictured ) , said @entity1 he said the lessons learned by one car could be stored and transferred to future @entity187 or @entity188			2
at the event , @entity1 also unveiled its ‘ virtual windscreen ’ that offers drivers a 3d image instrument cluster , and could replace the rear view mirror			1
it uses the entire windscreen as a display so the driver ’s eyes need never leave the road , and high quality hazard , speed and navigation symbols are projected together onto the screen			1
@entity1 is also developing a gesture control system to keep the driver ’s eyes on the road , and reduce distraction by limiting the need to look at or feel for buttons and switches to press			2
this is based on touchscreens that detect the proximity of a user ’s finger from around 6 inches ( 15cm ) , which means the system can be used to accurately track a user ’s hand and any gestures it makes inside the car			2
