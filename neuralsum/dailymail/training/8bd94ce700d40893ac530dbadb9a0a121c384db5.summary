it has been five long years since 13 - year - old @entity1 and his older brothers pistol whipped and robbed a pizza delivery driver in @entity4 , @entity5			1
since then , @entity1 has been to juvenile detention and remains on probation for the crime			1
his older brothers , both members of local gangs , are still serving time in prison			1
but @entity1 has made an unlikely ally , one who is now mentoring him and helping him stay away from trouble : the victim of his crime			1
' i see a lot of myself in @entity19 , ' @entity16 , 24 , told @entity20 in a interview about their redemption story , from assailant and victim to close friends			1
' i do n’t see @entity27 as a sum of mistakes and where he ’s from			2
i see him as a human			0
that ’s bigger and more important than any mistake , any background			0
' buddies : @entity1 ( left ) , 18 , and @entity16 , 24 , have come a long way from when @entity1 , then 13 , assaulted @entity16 while he worked as a pizza delivery driver after the attack , @entity16 needed 70 stitches and three years of physical therapy @entity16 , then 19 , was on his last pizza delivery in 2009 when he buzzed the apartment where @entity1 and his two older brothers were			1
he heard a gun cock to his side			0
' everything slowed down , ' he told the @entity20			0
' the man with the gun told him to get down on his knees			0
' i thought it was over at that point in time , ' he told the paper			0
' i asked him , ‘ are you going to kill me ? ’ he said , ‘ yes			0
'' when @entity16 thought all was lost , the man ran away and all three suspects fled in his delivery car			1
@entity16 was left with a cut above his left eye that required 70 stitches , post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be in physical therapy for three years for post-concussion syndrome			1
the three suspects were eventually arrested and sentenced for the crime			0
when @entity16 confronted one of his adult assailants in court , he told him , ' you not only stole my car and money that night , you stole something more valuable : my genuine trust in people and my surroundings			1
' but once @entity16 saw @entity1 in court — a 13 - year - old boy following the only example he 'd seen growing up — his heart began to soften			1
' my gosh , this is a child , ' he thought			0
' how the heck does somebody get there ? ' he started attending all of @entity1 's court hearings and offered the troubled teen words of encouragement			1
once @entity1 was released from juvenile detention , @entity16 dropped by his foster home			1
the two played video games for a while , and @entity16 finally asked him the question that burned in his mind : ' why ? ' ' it was just what i seen , i breathed , i looked , i did , ' @entity1 told the @entity20			1
' it was a family thing			0
some people ca n’t help the fact that all they brothers is gang members			2
so when i was growing up , that ’s all i seen			0
' the two men have forged an unlikely friendship since @entity1 and his older brothers attacked @entity16 in 2009 but slowly , @entity1 started to realize he did n't need to enter a life of crime just because of the example he 'd had			1
' that changed my life at that point in time more than the assault , ' @entity16 told the @entity20			2
' it was indicative of a bigger problem — this just was n’t about me ' ' i knew that he cared about my future , so it was nothing but respect , ' the 18 - year - old added about his mentor			0
@entity1 is studying to become a barber and works as a cook in @entity126 , @entity5			1
his probation will be over in a year			0
once that 's taken care of , he wants to go live on his own and is considering studying business administration in college			0
@entity16 has already offered him a spot at his apartment near @entity134 , where he studies political science			2
together , the two attend meetings with a local group that helps men re-enter society after spending time behind bars			2
growing up , @entity1 never thought he had a future to look forward to			2
' when i was younger , when i was gang banging , the older kids was telling me , ‘ we need people in the hood to go to college to be lawyers , to be doctors , ’ ' he said			2
' but we see them , they ’re not doing that			0
they telling us that but they still selling drugs , they still toting guns			0
' but now , next to his new friend and mentor , he knows he has much ahead of him			0
' with so much trust and how much he believe in me , ' @entity1 told the paper , ' i do n’t want to disappoint him			2
' @entity1 and @entity16 attend meetings with a local group that helps men re-enter society after spending time behind bars			1

@entity1 was 13 when he *joined* his older brothers in robbing a local pizza delivery driver , @entity16 , 19
