by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 19 june 2013 a couple who spent a decade trying for a baby and endured seven stillbirths and miscarriages have finally had a healthy baby girl			1
last year @entity6 was fitted with a cervical stitch and baby @entity8 was born in april			1
despite being born three months prematurely , she has now been able to go home			1
mrs @entity6 , 39 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , said : ‘ my husband @entity15 and i call @entity8 our " rainbow baby ” because after riding a hard storm , there is always a rainbow , so she is definitely a miracle and she means the world to us all			1
’ @entity6 and @entity20 , both 39 , went through seven miscarriages and stillbirths over a period of ten years before @entity8 was born in april this year over the past ten years , mrs @entity6 tried time and again to successfully carry a baby , but faced the agony of losing each of her seven babies - @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
each of these pregnancies only survived up to 24 weeks so the couple faced a desperate wait to see if @entity8 would survive			2
mrs @entity6 , a former nursery nurse , said : ‘ i did n't know anything about stillbirths and miscarriages until we went through it			1
‘ i would be fine and then sometimes i would have bleeds and sudden pains and my waters would just go			0
‘ i would then be in labour for weeks where i was prone to infection , and it proved too much for all of the babies			2
after her seventh miscarriage , mrs @entity6 was fitted with a cervical stitch which strengthened her cervix enough to enable her to carry @entity8 @entity8 was born three months prematurely weighing just 1lb 6oz and spent the first two months of her life in hospital ‘ nothing can prepare you for a stillbirth			1
it 's the silence that is the worst part			0
‘ knowing you have been through a pregnancy , means you expect to have a baby at the end of it			0
you ca n't explain how hard it is			0
‘ @entity15 was the hardest part because there was nothing he could do			0
’ mr and mrs @entity6 were already parents to @entity68 , 19 , @entity69 , 13 , and @entity70 , 10 , but felt they should keep trying for a fourth baby			1
‘ we always wanted a big family			0
we wanted four children and so we thought it was something we were meant to do so kept trying , ’ said mrs @entity6			1
mr and mrs @entity6 say that they call @entity8 their ' rainbow baby ' because ' after riding a hard storm , there is always a rainbow ' when mrs @entity6 was carrying @entity8 she was put on bed - rest at @entity82 in an attempt to stop her waters breaking too early but she still went into labour when only 25 weeks pregnant ‘ at first we decided not to try again but then we just could n't			1
some people think it 's strange that we kept trying but if we had n't we would n't have @entity8 here today			2
’ despite having a normal birth with @entity68 , both @entity69 and @entity70 were born prematurely but went on to become healthy children			0
after the series of miscarriages , mrs @entity6 was fitted with a cervical stitch , a procedure known as a tracheloplasty , which helps to strengthen the cervix and helps prevent premature labour			1
she said : ‘ i was put on pure bed - rest at @entity82 and spent most of my pregnancy there in the hope it would stop my waters breaking			0
‘ i went into labour with @entity8 at 25 weeks but i managed to hold on to her for another two weeks and she was born by caesarean section			1
the couple , who also have three older children - @entity68 , 19 , @entity69 , 13 , and @entity70 , 10 - were desperate to have a fourth baby because they had always wanted to have a big family they say they will always remember the seven children they lost - @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
@entity8 is pictured with her sisters , @entity70 , 10 , ( left ) and @entity69 , 13 , ( right ) ‘ @entity8 was delivered in a sack of fluid which was popped when she was born to make the birth less traumatic			2
’ she was born in april , weighing 1lb 6oz , however the family 's fight was not over yet			1
mr @entity20 , 39 , a training consultant , said : ‘ we spent weeks by her bedside , praying that she was going to survive			2
‘ the fact that she had been born alive was a step forward for us and we were n't prepared to let her go after all we had been through			0
‘ we watched parents taking their babies home every day and we just dreamed of the day we could take @entity8 home			1
i think we always worried it would never come			0
’ now back at home , the family say they will never forget the seven members they lost			2
mr and mrs @entity6 say that on each of the stillborn children 's birthdays they will light a candle to remember them mrs @entity6 said : ‘ we will always remember our other children			1
we are always talking about them - it 's healthy for the children			0
‘ we have special boxes and teddies that we have bought for each of them and on their birthdays we will light a candle to remember them by			0
‘ we buy them all cards and balloons which we let off into the sky as a way of reaching out to them , and at @entity151 we put their decorations on the tree to remember them by			0
‘ a baby is still a baby , which i carried and wo n't forget just because they 're not with us today			0
‘ we would not wish anyone to have to go through what we have been through , but we are pleased we kept trying			0
‘ she 's a little miracle and we will never take forget how lucky we are			0

@entity6 and @entity20 , both 39 , from @entity11 lost 7 babies over a decade
mrs @entity6 was fitted with a cervical stitch to help her carry a baby to term
a cervical stitch or tracheloplasty involves stitching a tape around the cervix to keep it *closed* and prevent a baby being born too early
@entity8 was born three months early in april , weighing just 1lb 6oz , but she is now home and doing well
