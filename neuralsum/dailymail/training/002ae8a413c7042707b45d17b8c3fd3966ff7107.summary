i 'm going to kick you in the f * * * * * * head			0
' the latest shaming clip emerged as @entity11 announced that he will end speculation today over the whereabouts of his brother who has not been seen for a week since taking a leave of absence to deal with his alcohol and crack - smoking addictions			1
the new video , which was posted on the @entity20 's website , was reportedly shot in a @entity2 bar on april 27 - in the same three - day period where videos also emerged of @entity24 making lewd , drunken remarks about a female politician in a bar and another of him smoking a purported crack pipe in his sister 's basement			1
he has now spoken out about rehab , calling it the best thing he ever did despite declaring rehab to be ' amazing ' , citizens of @entity49 's largest city are dubious their mayor is where he says he is , with sightings of @entity24 around town reaching fevered level as members of the public upload pictures to @entity57			1
