by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 6 september 2012 it was one of @entity3 's dearest wishes			0
after his death , the millionaire turkey tycoon wanted his @entity7 mistress of 23 years to carry on living in the luxury @entity9 villa they had shared			1
he made three wills , and in a pleading letter begged his estranged wife and children to let @entity16 keep his £ 12million mansion near @entity18			1
@entity19 businessman @entity3 ( left ) , and lover @entity16 ( right ) but it has now emerged in a @entity22 case that his three adopted children – who were left nothing in his will – have defied this wish and are claiming their share of the villa			1
despite the three wills , mr @entity3 knew that he was powerless against @entity7 inheritance laws , which decreed that 75 per cent of his property would go to his family			1
so in 2006 , four years before he died aged 80 , he wrote a letter addressed to @entity33 , at that time his wife of 54 years , and ' all members of my family '			1
in it , he described how ' @entity39 has supported me unfailingly for years ' , and reminded his children that he had already been generous to them and long provided financial support			0
inheritance : @entity43 , one of the three children mr @entity3 adopted with his wife @entity33 miss @entity16 , now 62 , was at mr @entity3 's bedside when he died , along with his wife			1
her existence was a secret until last year when mr @entity3 's will was published , revealing he had left her £ 1million			0
it also revealed that he had left all but one per cent of his 39 per cent holding – believed to be worth £ 30million – to @entity54 , his son from a five - year affair with a @entity58 aristocrat			0
the 30 - year - old internet entrepreneur is not claiming his share of the @entity7 villa			2
in the letter , mr @entity3 wrote : ' the purpose of this letter is to explain to you all ... my thinking in relation to my absolute gift of my @entity7 villa to @entity39			2
' @entity39 has supported me unfailingly for many years and particularly so during my recent illnesses			0
' without such support , i might not have been able to continue directing our family company for our mutual benefit … ' in reaching my decision i have taken into account the fact that each of you is very well housed with at least one property each and that , directly or indirectly , i have provided financially for each of you over a very long period of years			0
' i wish the @entity7 villa to continue to be occupied and enjoyed and consider @entity84 would be the best person to take on this responsibility '			2
marriage breakdown : @entity3 is pictured with his former wife @entity87 , who is the mother of his three adopted children ' the purpose of this letter is to explain to you all ... my thinking in relation to my absolute gift of my @entity7 village to @entity39			1
' @entity39 has supported me unfailingly for many years and particularly so during my recent illnesses			0
' without such support , i might not have been able to continue directing our family company for our mutual benefit			0
' in reaching my decision i have taken into account the fact that each of you is very well housed with at least one property each and that , directly or indirectly , i have provided financially for each of you over a very long period of years			0
' i wish the @entity7 villa to continue to be occupied and enjoyed and consider @entity84 would be the best person to take on this responsibility			2
' in one of his wills – two @entity7 and one @entity110 – mr @entity3 , whose property outside of @entity7 was worth around £ 40million , bequeathed the villa to his 62 - year - old mistress outright			2
but a ruling at the @entity22 yesterday revealed that his three adopted children , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , have not adhered to their late father 's request and instead have insisted on their right to their stake in the villa – 56.25 per cent excluding @entity54 's share			1
this leaves miss @entity16 with 43.75 per cent , but judge @entity126 said she ' accepts that there is nothing she can do about this '			0
the case came to the @entity22 because the children had argued that the £ 2million inheritance tax they are liable to pay on their share of the villa should be paid out of their late father 's @entity110 estate			1
however , rejecting their arguments , judge @entity136 said mr @entity3 had clearly wished miss @entity16 to inherit the entire villa and to have her @entity7 inheritance tax bill paid from his estate			1
' he did not want his adopted children to have any part of the property			0
he concluded : ' for this reason , i hold that the adopted children have no right under the @entity110 will to have their tax liability discharged , or to be reimbursed if they have paid it			2
' history : mr @entity3 fathered @entity151 ( left ) by @entity58 aristocrat @entity152 ( right ) after the breakdown of his 58 - year marriage to @entity33 despite his extramarital affairs , mr @entity3 , who once described his private life as ' complicated ' , never divorced his childhood sweetheart @entity33 , 83 , whom he married in 1952			1
a @entity3 family spokesman said they did not wish to comment .			0
