by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 insists summer signing @entity5 has been signed to play with and put pressure on @entity7 - not replace him			1
@entity5 joined @entity3 on a four - year contract from @entity9 in june and has plenty of pedigree having scored over 140 goals in @entity14 football and won 12 caps for @entity16			1
the 29 - year - old 's arrival caused speculation about the possible departure of @entity7 , who scored 25 goals last season during an excellent first campaign in @entity23 , and the frontman was linked to @entity25 and @entity26 after impressing for the @entity27 at the @entity28 in @entity29			2
signing : @entity2 said @entity30 was brought to the club to compete with @entity7 but @entity2 is adamant the pair can thrive together after free transfer @entity5 claimed his first goal in @entity23 football on tuesday night to ease @entity3 into the third round of the @entity37			1
' it 's definitely not the case that he 's his replacement , ' @entity2 said about @entity5 , whose strike put paid to the cup ambitions of @entity44 outfit @entity43			2
' i do n't think it 's about pressure on @entity7			0
' through the season we 'll see different things : they 'll play as lone strikers , they 'll play as a pair , use them in different ways			0
transfer : @entity2 said he is not worried about @entity7 's future and no bids have been made for the @entity27 striker ' it 's not a competition between them but obviously we want them all to push each other and every striker will want to be top scorer			1
' but it 's about them working together which they 've done very well in pre-season and been great with each other on the training field			0
' @entity2 insists @entity3 have received no offers for @entity7 with the transfer deadline now only five days away			1
' we have n't had one offer for @entity7			0
it has n't worried me , the speculation did n't concern me because we had it with others like @entity80 over the years and it 's the way it is , ' @entity2 said			1
pedigree : @entity5 spent five years with @entity14 side @entity9 and also has 12 caps for the national side ' when you get a formal offer is perhaps when you worry about it , but i 'm prepared to use them both			2
' if someone comes in with an offer , that 's the only time you think about it			0
' it 's not over until the window closes and that 's with all of our players , an offer could come in for any of them			0
' but i ca n't concern myself with that because my focus is on preparing for the football and @entity102 on the weekend			0
' if something comes in i 'll deal with it then			0
' concern : @entity2 says no offers have come in for either @entity7 or captain @entity80 it ’s not too late to play @entity109 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1
