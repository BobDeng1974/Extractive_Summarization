scientists are in the process of developing a substance that could be used to create everything from armour to smartphone screens			1
@entity6 , which is made from plant matter that is broken down into tiny pieces , is not only fast and cheap to make , but its creation only requires water , sunshine and time			1
scientists claim that they are close to being able to produce the substance from the @entity15 xylinum bacteria which is used to produce vinegar			1
is algae the next super-material ? researchers have found a new method to create @entity6 , which can be used in everything from body armour to phone screens			1
here , a @entity25 man sails his boat along the algae - filled coastline of @entity29 , in eastern @entity25 's @entity31 province			2
the substance could be used in a huge range of ways			2
it is a vegetable compound so could act as a food bulker or a bandage			2
it could also be used in speakers , computers and cigarette filters			2
firms are also experimenting using it in body armour , while others are developing tablet and smartphone screens			2
until recently this bacteria could be used to synthesis nanocellulose but it was not possible to make it sufficiently cheaply for it to be useful commercially			1
however , there is now a new process which involves creating a nanocellulose ‘ factory ’ in which the algae , when given water , sunlight and time , could produce the substance without intervention			1
this now means that nanocellulose could be produced in the quantities needed to make it commercially viable			1
professor @entity65 of the @entity66 said : ‘ if we can complete the final steps , we will have accomplished one of the most important potential agricultural transformations ever			0
‘ we will have plants that produce nanocellulose abundantly and inexpensively			1
it can become the raw material for sustainable production of biofuels and many other products			0
‘ while producing nanocellulose , the algae will absorb carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas linked to global warming			1
’ is this the next supermaterial ? @entity6 is made from plant matter that is broken into tiny pieces it has a long history - in the 1800s , @entity89 scientist @entity88 first discovered that vinegar - making bacteria make ' a sort of moist skin , swollen , gelatinous and slippery ' - a ' skin ' now known as bacterial nanocellulose			1
cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on @entity98 , a material , like plastics , consisting of molecules linked together into long chains			0
cellulose makes up tree trunks and branches , corn stalks and cotton fibers , and it is the main component of paper and cardboard			0
people eat cellulose in ' dietary fiber , ' the indigestible material in fruits and vegetables			0
cows , horses and termites can digest the cellulose in grass , hay and wood			0
most cellulose consists of wood fibers and cell wall remains			0
very few living organisms can actually synthesize and secrete cellulose in its native nanostructure form of microfibrils			0
at this level , nanometer - scale fibrils are very hydrophilic and look like jelly			0
a nanometer is one - millionth the thickness of a @entity133 dime			0
nevertheless , cellulose shares the unique properties of other nanometer - sized materials -- properties much different from large quantities of the same material			0
@entity6 - based materials can be stronger than steel and stiffer than @entity142			1
great strength , light weight and other advantages has fostered interest in using it in everything from lightweight armor and ballistic glass to wound dressings and scaffolds for growing replacement organs for transplantation .			0

@entity6 is made from plant matter that is broken into tiny pieces
can now be made using a ' factory ' in which algae is given water , sunlight and time and left to produce the substance without intervention
this method is cheap and quick making nanocellulose commercially viable
