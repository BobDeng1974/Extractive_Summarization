an @entity1 ’s home has long supposedly been his castle			2
but a council has ruled he can not make it look like a wooden fort – even if he claims it is a vital defence necessary to make his children feel safe			1
that is what happened at this terrace house in @entity11 , where owner @entity12 ( who is in fact @entity14 ) installed a 6ft 5in fence around his front garden , without planning permission			1
fenced off : @entity18 complained that the wooden barricade around the front garden made the house look like a sinister fortress mr @entity12 is an architect who has worked for rock star @entity23 and a number of fashionable restaurants			1
but his wooden stockade for his own home did not win acclaim from neighbours , who claimed it made the house look like a sinister and ‘ aggressive ’ fortress , was out of character with the street , and could actually be a magnet for burglars – who could hide behind it			1
after mr @entity12 was told to apply for retrospective planning permission , his barricade was rejected			1
he will now have to take it down , yet is mystified at the opposition			0
mr @entity12 , an @entity14 architect , has been told to remove the fence mr @entity12 , who bought the property for £ 620,000 in 2012 , talked about his home in the @entity45 last year , describing it as ‘ the ugly house ’			1
but he claims that the palisade he erected around it early this year was actually a thing of beauty , and that the area would be improved if more homeowners followed his lead			0
asked why he had built the barricade , mr @entity12 said it was created to protect his family			1
‘ we had some problems with someone being chased into our house late at night , and it ’s put my young children in a situation where they are quite nervous now , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s really helped for them			0
it gives us a lot more security			0
' it gives us two lines of defence before entering the house			2
i ’m not sure why it has been so radically opposed			0
’ mr @entity12 claimed there were ‘ four or five others ’ in the area , adding that having a street full of such front fences would be ‘ very beautiful ’			2
he added : ‘ in my opinion that street is a little bit of a disaster			0
' it feels like a car park – people pour concrete in their front yards			0
it ’s not a great example of streetscape			0
’ mr @entity12 put the fence up around his house to make his children feel more safe after someone was ' chased into the house ' late one night ' modest ' : mr @entity12 said the fence was an improvement on the street in @entity11 where he lives but neighbour @entity100 , 43 , said : ‘ it ’s like a little prison , not a house			1
‘ to change the look of the road is not nice			0
when the milkman or builders come over they always ask , “ why are these people doing this ? ” ’ it worker @entity111 , 52 , described the fortress house as ‘ an eyesore ’ and said : ‘ i do n’t know what they are protecting			2
' they must be running around naked or something			0
’ writer @entity118 , another neighbour , said : ‘ it ruins the look of the street and i ’m worried others will follow suit			0
' it ’s not appropriate			0
’ in mr @entity12 ’s belated planning application , he described his fence as ‘ a modest ’ construction			1
his application concluded that ‘ the fence improves the front forecourt area and is a neat design response to what was just a concrete driveway with minimal landscaping ’			2
but the planning application was rejected last week by @entity137 , which said it had ‘ a significantly unacceptable visual impact ’			2
a spokesman for the council said that planning permission was required for a fence or wall to the front of a property which would be more than one metre , or 3ft 3in , high			1

@entity12 built the fence to make his children feel more secure at home
someone had been ' chased into ' the house in @entity11 late one night
@entity14 architect *'s* efforts to secure home *slammed* by neighbours
@entity159 rejected his retrospective planning permission application
