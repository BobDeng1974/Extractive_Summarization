@entity1 recovered from a false start at @entity3 and the early loss of full - back @entity5 to maintain their @entity8 title quest with a resounding win			1
@entity11 ’s national team were behind for the first quarter of this match , as they struggled to generate the level of intensity shown during their seismic triumph in @entity18 eight days earlier			2
but when they needed inspiration , it was delivered in stunning fashion by @entity23			2
following his try - scoring heroics at the @entity25 , the on - song @entity27 centre illuminated proceedings on his first start in a home test			0
the 23 - year - old scored twice – either side of half - time – as @entity1 made light of their initial problems to cut loose			1
both his tries were acts of attacking genius , showcasing the pace and footwork which have drawn increasing comparisons with @entity44 , who was watching on from a tv studio			0
while a late @entity82 try would have been a source of frustration for the coaches , they will have be satisfied with a 30 - point winning margin , after falling short of the title on points - difference in the last two years			1
the head injury sustained by @entity5 is a concern , but there were several performances to savour			0
@entity74 was an astute livewire at scrum - half , @entity93 maintained his recent high standards , rookie lock @entity97 excelled again and @entity98 led with now familiar distinction			1
@entity100 was a rampaging force at @entity102 and @entity23 provided the show - stopping highlights			1
the anticipated script would not have featured an @entity82 try within the first four minutes , but that was the reality as the visitors surged ahead in fine style			0
having contrived to lose the first two lineouts on their own throw , @entity108 managed to steal a throw intended for @entity98 and the ball was rapidly transferred across to the opposite flank			0
@entity114 , @entity47 ’s talismanic captain , made good ground down the left and after a strong drive by @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 combined to release @entity114 again			1
the no 8 dummied outside and charged on through @entity122 ’s tackle to score			0
@entity74 touches down beside the posts for @entity1 's first try of the second half and their third try of the match @entity23 leaps over the line and scores a second try for @entity1 as @entity11 's side took control in the first half @entity1 xv : @entity5 ; @entity134 , @entity23 , @entity135 , may ; @entity136 , @entity137 ; @entity93 , @entity138 , @entity122 ; @entity139 , @entity97 ; @entity140 , @entity98 ( capt ) , @entity142 replacements : @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity53 , @entity150 tries : @entity152 , @entity23 ( 2 ) , @entity153 , @entity53 , @entity147 conversions : @entity155 ( 3 ) , @entity53 ( 1 ) penalties : @entity155 ( 3 ) , @entity47 xv : @entity157 ; @entity120 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 ; @entity161 , @entity162 ; @entity163 , @entity118 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity108 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity114 replacements : @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 tries : @entity114 , @entity158 ( 2 ) conversion : @entity179 ( 1 ) @entity119 missed the conversion but the @entity47 ’s @entity182 fly - half continued to pose a threat to the hosts in open play			1
in the 13th minute , he picked a low pass neatly off the ground and chipped into @entity1 ’s 22 , where @entity159 claimed the ball and collided with @entity5			1
the attack fizzled out and there was a prolonged delay as the stricken @entity5 was placed on a stretcher and carried off			2
while the home side were forced into a back - line reshuffle – after electing to bring on @entity150 rather than @entity53 , who has previously operated at full - back – the break in proceedings allowed them to re-group and they began to impose themselves			1
there was another scare when @entity201 ’s interception led to a defensive scramble , but the tide was slowly turning			0
a 21st - minute @entity136 penalty belatedly put @entity1 on the scoreboard and three minutes later , they had their first try , although it was a marginal decision to award it			1
from an attacking lineout on the left , @entity139 sent @entity100 storming into the corner , but he appeared to be held up by @entity210			1
replays were inconclusive , but the @entity212 ruled that a try could be awarded			0
@entity47 were still coming to terms with that setback when they conceded another try which was a masterpiece of individual running class			0
it stemmed from a turn - over as @entity98 stole the ball at a ruck near halfway and it was sent out to @entity23 on the right			2
the @entity224 – now operating on the wing – left @entity161 flailing with a nimble side - step and accelerated into space			0
he then shaped to pass outside , raced on past @entity120 ’s desperate attempted ankle - tap and away to score and bring the house down			0
@entity136 added the conversion and @entity1 maintained their 10 - point advantage as @entity119 missed two penalty shots at goal			1
@entity236 ’s men then had a chance for a third try before the break , but @entity240 slipped and failed to make use of a two - man overlap outside			0
@entity23 escapes the clutches of @entity47 's @entity120 as he makes a break for the try line before scoring @entity1 's second try @entity23 is congratulated by his @entity1 team - mates after putting the home side firmly in control of the @entity8 clash @entity100 is adjudged to have grounded the ball to touch down for @entity1 's opening try after consultation with the video referee @entity136 got @entity1 's first points on the board as he struck a penalty between the posts after @entity47 had taken an early lead @entity1 's @entity5 was knocked out after a crushing collision with @entity159 resulting in a long stoppage in play @entity5 is smashed to the ground following the collision as the @entity1 full back was visiblly unconcious medics tend to @entity5 after the collision and there was a long break in play , which interrupted @entity47 's momentum @entity5 left the field on a stretcher as he is given oxygen - it was later revealed that the full back had regained conciousness after half - time , @entity136 struck another penalty but then – out of the blue – @entity47 hit back with a second try of their own			1
it was a gem , too			0
@entity120 chipped out of defence , regathered the ball and ran on , before being tackled deep in @entity286 territory			0
when the ball was sent in - field , @entity158 ran a forceful line straight past @entity139 and clear			2
he was half - tackled by @entity134 but leapt back up and went over the line			0
but the @entity47 revival was short - lived			2
in the 55th minute , @entity1 won a penalty from a scrum in front of the @entity82 posts and as the visitors switched off , @entity74 took a quick tap and dived over to score			1
@entity136 duly converted and landed another penalty just before the hour mark			2
shortly afterwards , @entity23 struck again			0
the ball came to @entity155 from a scrum near halfway and his canny , delayed pass put his @entity27 team - mate straight through a gap and his pace took him away from the cover defenders to touch down his second try and @entity155 converted before going off			0
his replacement , @entity53 , took just seconds to make his mark			0
@entity240 scorched past tiring opponents on the left and cut inside , then picked out the supporting run by @entity57 ’s fly - half , who claimed a try on his first @entity8 appearance for seven years			2
he converted it too , but was unable to claim the extras after @entity50 marked his own @entity3 comeback by scoring from a lineout drive 11 minutes from time			1
@entity158 added a late consolation try at the other end , but it did little to tarnish the @entity286 feel - good mood			1
@entity47 's @entity114 goes over the line and touches down the first try as the visitors take the lead in the first few minutes @entity1 captain @entity98 prepares to release the ball as he goes to ground under a flurry of bodies @entity98 climbs highest to take the line - out under the lights at @entity3 as @entity1 made it two wins from two @entity150 watches from afar as @entity1 and @entity47 packs engage in a scrummage @entity1 skipper @entity98 shakes hands with a bruised and battered @entity166 after the match at @entity339			1

@entity1 beat @entity47 47 - 10 at @entity3 as @entity11 's side kept up winning record in @entity8
the visitors took a surprise early lead when @entity114 touched down after just four minutes
there was a long break in play as @entity5 received treatment before leaving on a stretcher after a hard hit
@entity5 collided with @entity47 centre @entity159 and appeared to be knocked out following the collision
@entity100 and @entity23 touched down in quick *succession* after a @entity136 penalty
@entity136 *kicked* over the first points of the second half before @entity158 touched down for @entity47 's second try
@entity74 , @entity23 and @entity53 , and @entity50 added further tries for @entity1 as they ran out *comfortable* winners
@entity158 *muscled* his way over in the right corner to add a late consolation try for the @entity47
