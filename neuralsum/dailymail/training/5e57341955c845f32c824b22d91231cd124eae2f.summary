by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 20 june 2012 a girl who fell pregnant at the age of 11 and became @entity4 ’s youngest mother is expecting her second child			2
@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , now aged 18 , was forced to give up her toddler for adoption two years after giving birth in 2006			1
the decision came after she revealed the baby was born as the result of a rape by her own brother			2
@entity4 's youngest mother , @entity6 is now pregnant with her second child although @entity6 spent several years addicted to drugs and alcohol after quitting school , she says she has now turned her life around and is ready to be a mother			1
she is in a relationship with her fiance , trainee mechanic @entity24 , 25 , who she lives with , and she has announced that she is two months ’ pregnant			1
@entity6 told closer magazine : ' i did not want to give up my daughter , but i was too young to be a mum			1
' i feel ready now			0
my daughter ca n’t be replaced , but this is a second chance			0
' she discovered she was pregnant first time round in 2005 and at first claimed a local boy was the father to protect her mother , @entity32 , 39			2
after giving birth she describes that she never stopped the ' fags and drink ' , and soon spiralled out of control under the very noses of her social workers			1
she ended up in a residential unit , rather than with her child and it seemed inevitable that the authorities were always going to take @entity6 's baby away			1
unsettling : pictures taken of @entity6 soon after the birth in 2006 when she was 14 , she revealed that her twisted brother @entity48 was the father of her child			1
and when it came out , her family fell apart in the event , and @entity6 was left to sign papers authorising the adoption			1
' i signed the papers because i knew i would lose in court and they would take her from me anyway			0
this way i thought i would get visitation rights			0
' in 2009 @entity60 was jailed for four years and has now been released and lives at home with his mother			2
he was 16 when the attack happened , at the family home in @entity8 , five years older than his sister			2
she says the rape was not a one - off , but part of a wider pattern of abuse			0
talking about her daughter @entity6 says : ' i would have given my life for her ' - but it was a complex relationship			1
there were times i looked at her and i saw my brother @entity48 in her face			0
but i still loved her , with all my heart			0
' @entity6 says that she and @entity24 , who had both experimented with heroin , have both been weaned off it after receiving support from a drug centre			1
she says she was jubilant when doctors confirmed her pregnancy			0
' i was so excited and @entity24 was over the moon , too , ' she said			0
' i ca n’t wait to buy clothes and decorate a nursery for when the baby arrives			2
' @entity6 , who sends her adopted child @entity92 and birthday cards and gifts , added : ' my daughter is six now and at school			1
i plan to tell baby about their big sister			0
if i have a girl , she will take her name as a middle name			0
i hope we can all meet as a family one day , but meanwhile i will be the best mum i can			0
