by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 gave off the impression of being the perfect mother while hiding a heroin addiction a former drug addict who started using heroin when she had two young children has spoken of her own battle with drugs and who like @entity12 appeared to be the perfect mother			1
@entity2 , now 35 , started using the drug when she had two young children and even fell pregnant with her third child @entity15 while she was still using			1
her story echoes that of ms @entity12 , also a mother to 23 - month - old @entity18 and 11 - month - old @entity19 , who was found dead at her home in @entity21 last month			1
today it was confirmed at the opening of an inquest that heroin played a role in her tragic death			1
in a case of history repeating itself , @entity12 ' own mother @entity28 died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 , aged 41			1
both ms @entity2 and ms @entity12 had to deal with the death of a parent at a young age and then juggled bringing up two very young children , seeming to be perfect mothers			1
ms @entity2 said : ' our stories are pretty similar			1
we both had traumatic childhoods and both lost a parent			0
i was a young mum struggling with grief and the drugs offered me a refuge from that pain			2
‘ i juggled drug use and two small babies and nobody had a clue			2
to the outside world i was the perfect mum			1
‘ i would n’t be surprised if it was the same for @entity12			1
‘ if it is the case i feel desperately sorry that she did n’t get the help she needed			0
i did and it saved my life meaning my children did n’t have to grow up without a mother			1
‘ i am so grateful for that			0
‘ it sounds awful but without it i was n’t able to be a mother because i simply could not function			2
‘ it got to the point where i needed heroin to be able to be a mum			2
i could n’t cook the dinner or clean up without it			2
i told myself i had to keep using to be a good mum			0
’ ms @entity2 , of @entity72 kept her addiction a secret from her family and friends by not seeing them as frequently and making sure there were no visible signs of drug use			1
and she believes it would have been even easier for someone in the public eye to hide an addiction			0

it was confirmed today heroin played a part in her death last month ms @entity2 appeared to be the perfect mother and kept her addiction to heroin a secret from her family and friends ‘ we only see what they want us to see			1
@entity12 would have been able to prepare for tv appearances by getting her hair and make up done and making sure she was on form and presentable , ' she speculated			1
‘ but that does n’t mean it was n’t a different story at home			2
‘ you can give off the impression of being a fantastic parent while being addicted to heroin			2
i know because i did it and it would have been even easier with more money			0
‘ my mother had no idea at all i was a heroin user			1
‘ i would tidy the house and make an extra effort with my hair and make up to look fit and well			0
it ’s easy to make people see what you want them to see because they believe what they want to believe			0
@entity2 , left , said she too lost a parent at a very young age , similar to @entity12 , right ‘ nobody wants to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies is addicted to heroin so if anyone ever questioned me i told them not to be silly and that was the end of it			1
’ but behind closed doors @entity132 ’s use of heroin was affecting her parenting			2
she added : ' if i had taken the drug i was happy and able to play with the children in the park and run the home , but of course that had financial implications because we had little money			1
‘ once i sold the tv to pay for heroin and the house was always cold because we could n’t afford heating			0
’ ‘ i told myself that it was ok because i needed the drugs to be a good mum			0
only later when i got clean could i see how twisted that idea was			0
’ @entity132 said that nobody wanted to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies was addicted to heroin the former addict only managed to turn her life around after her third daughter , @entity15 was born in august 2002			1
it was the shame of giving birth to a daughter addicted to drugs that made her seek help			0
she explained : ‘ through my pregnancy i kept telling myself i would stop			0
but without it i was a wreck			0
i needed it to get through the day			0
' it was only then that the gravity hit me because the drugs had kept me numb			0
when i saw my baby lying in hospital i broke down			0
ms @entity2 , pictured with daughter @entity15 is now helps other young people who are addicts ‘ i had been kidding myself that i could be an addict and a good mum , but i had failed my children in every sense			1
’ she fell pregnant again with her ex partner , but still managed to stay clean and left him a year later			0
she then met her husband and has had another three children			0
she is proud never to have touched drugs again and recently admitted the truth about their childhood to her children ms @entity2 , who now works as a peer mentor advisor helping other young addicts said : ‘ thankfully i am here to tell them the story			1
it could have been very different as what may have happened to @entity12 shows			2
‘ they were very shocked but very understanding and supportive			0
i have raised lovely compassionate children and only hope my story helps others get help before it ’s too late			1
