by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:46 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:23 est , 23 december 2013 the mother of a schoolboy who apparently killed himself after being falsely accused of rape has branded the justice system a ' joke ' after one of his bullies walked free			1
@entity10 , 16 , is believed to have committed suicide following a hate campaign against him which started after he told police about drug dealers plaguing his neighbourhood			1
@entity16 , 18 , admitted assaulting the teenager , but escaped jail as he was handed a 12 - month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work			1
grief : @entity10 , pictured left with his mother @entity22 , apparently killed himself after being bullied ; @entity16 , right , one of his tormentors , has walked free from jail after the victim reported drug dealers in his home town of @entity29 , @entity30 to the police , false rumours spread that he had tied a girl to a tree and raped her			1
@entity10 was then targeted in the streets by angry mobs , while vigilantes turned up at his front door saying they wanted to ' get rid of the vermin ' - but both his school and the police said they were unable to help him			1
he began self - harming and was found critically ill in his bedroom on october 31 , just days before he was due to testify at @entity43 's trial , dying in hospital two days later			2
the teenager 's death was not mentioned during @entity43 's sentencing at @entity48			1
after the thug - who has not been linked to drug dealing - walked free from court , @entity10 's mother @entity22 described the punishment as ' bloody disgusting ' and said the authorities had let her son down			1
rumours : after @entity10 spoke out against drug dealers , he was falsely accused of raping a girl ' this sentence is absolutely bloody disgusting but sadly i 'm not surprised as i was n't expecting much more , ' said company director mrs @entity63 , 45			1
' the justice system in @entity65 is just a laugh and a joke			1
' my son is dead because of these people and yet this guy is already back out on the streets walking scot - free			2
i do n't even know how to feel about it			0
' in this world as it stands at the moment it seems it does n't matter who you are or what you 've done , you 'll get away with it			0
it 's people like my son , the victims , that end up suffering and paying the price			2
it 's quite simply appalling , i 'm lost for words			2
' the bereaved mother has previously denounced officials for failing to protect @entity10 from local thugs after he spoke out against the drug dealers and was then targeted by the false rape claims			1
' the rumour went all over the place and on @entity93 and @entity10 went to live with his gran in @entity95 for a bit , ' mrs @entity63 said			1
wounded : @entity10 's injuries after he was attacked by a gang of bullies are pictured here , right ' straightaway i called the school and police but they said there was nothing they could do about it			1
they said it was just a rumour and that @entity93 is their bane			0
' @entity10 became a recluse in his own house			2
he was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it			0
' we would have gangs of 30 coming to my door shouting abuse when me and my family were in the house at around 10pm at night			0
we did n't feel safe in our home , the kids said they had come " to get rid of the vermin "			0
' this was a kid being called a rapist and it was n't true			0
@entity10 was never questioned as a rapist or charged , it was the bullies making it up			2
he could n't even walk along the road because of the name - calling and violence			0
' in june @entity43 attacked @entity10 outside his home , and threatened him with what the victim believed was a knife			1
school : officials at @entity141 said they were unable to prevent @entity10 being bullied in a statement given before his death , @entity10 said : ' he grabbed hold of my arms turning me towards him and pushed me into a bush			1
' he said , " tell me tell me			0
" i did n't understand what he wanted me to tell him but he said : " apparently you strapped someone to a tree and raped them and took pictures			2
" i said , " what are you on about ? " ' he threatened to break my nose and said : " if i see you , you are dead			0
" i screamed for my life and i saw him just staring me out			0
i thought my life was going to end			0
' as you can imagine i can no longer walk down the street as everyone calls me a rapist			0
i felt so scared for my life i wanted to break down and cry			0
i was scared to go out of the house			0
i wish i was n't here			0
' in mitigation @entity16 's lawyer @entity163 said : ' he did approach @entity166 and confront him with regards to the issue as to whether he assaulted one of his friends			1
