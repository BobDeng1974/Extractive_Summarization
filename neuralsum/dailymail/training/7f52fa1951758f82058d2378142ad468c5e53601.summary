no matter how poorly they play , @entity2 's @entity1 team are proving devilishly hard to beat			1
here at a bouncing @entity3 , @entity1 were for long periods as feeble , as poor , as we have seen in recent times			2
a goal down as the hour mark came and went , @entity1 were in very real danger of being tossed out of the @entity10 by a team from @entity12			1
without so much as a shot on goal to their name at half - time , there was no real reason to think @entity1 would survive the one from @entity20 left back @entity21 that flew past @entity22 in the 47th minute			1
@entity23 converts a penalty late on to seal a 3 - 1 victory - his first goal for @entity1 in 952 minutes @entity23 leaps into the air to celebrate his successful spot - kick in front of @entity1 's travelling supporters at @entity3 @entity1 won the penalty when @entity23 was sent crashing to the ground after a sliding challenge from goalkeeper @entity33 @entity34 pokes home the second against @entity20 from close - range having had his initial effort saved by @entity33 former @entity38 man @entity34 celebrates his goal with team - mate @entity40 in front of the travelling supporters at @entity3 @entity44 midfielder @entity43 equalises for @entity2 's side with a low , curling effort after 65 minutes @entity20 appealed for @entity43 's goal to be disallowed after @entity23 moved out of the way of the ball while in an offside position @entity43 looks towards @entity1 's travelling contingent as he passionately celebrates his vital second - half strike @entity20 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity33 6 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 6 ( @entity57 75 , 6 ) ; @entity58 6.5 ; @entity59 7 ( @entity60 75 , 6 ) , @entity61 7 , @entity21 7.5 ; @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 75 , 6 ) , @entity64 7			1

goals : @entity43 65 , @entity34 72 , @entity23 booked : @entity74 @entity87 : @entity77 referee : @entity89 6.5 * ratings by @entity91 at @entity3 @entity23 was back up front but to no avail			1
the @entity94 was n't even on the field as @entity1 mounted their comeback			2
there is something about @entity100 's team , though , that is preventing current difficulties reaching crisis level			0
the @entity1 manager called it ' team spirit '			2
it was ' incredible ' , he said			0
that may be overstating things a little			0
his players are paid to win football matches			0
if they do n't have team spirit then what do they have ? nevertheless , here again @entity1 found a way to get through as first @entity43 and then @entity34 scored goals that turned looming defeat in to victory and secured a quarter final tie at home to @entity117			1
there was even a late shot on target – and a goal for @entity23 – from the penalty spot			1
it was the @entity1 captain 's first shot on goal of the calendar year and he will be glad that one of the season 's most peculiar statistics is no more			2
@entity1 definitely will have to be better than this when @entity131 and his players turn up at @entity133 next month but that wo n't worry @entity100 now			1
the night 's crucial goals – the first two - also came from two players he did n't even particularly rate when he took the @entity1 job last summer			1
that wo n't worry him either			0
somehow @entity100 and his @entity1 team continue to carry their heads above water and , despite the manner of their football , there is something to be said for that			2
certainly after 50 minutes here , they looked to be in real trouble			0
neither team managed to create anything in the first half but @entity20 surged from the blocks at the start of the second period to put the frighteners on @entity1			1
centre forward @entity64 had carried a physical threat throughout but it was his run from deep that found @entity1 stretched in the 47th minute and enabled @entity20 to score			1
as @entity64 moved forwards , @entity21 appeared at speed to his left and although the defender 's cross shot looked as though it may be heading wide of the far post , @entity164 stretched out a foot and deflected the ball beneath @entity173 and in to the goal			1
@entity20 defender @entity21 lines up a shot early in the second half after being played in by team - mate @entity64 left back @entity21 powers his effort towards @entity22 's left - hand post after a marauding run forward in the 47th minute @entity21 's strike takes a deflection off @entity1 's @entity164 before catching out @entity173 and finding the back of the net former @entity185 man @entity21 leaps over the electronic hoardings at @entity3 to celebrate his strike in front of the home fans @entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates after giving the @entity12 side a surprise lead against @entity193 outfit @entity1 @entity34 poked home the winning goal for @entity1 after a cross from @entity164 - click here for more in our brilliant @entity198 @entity200 vs @entity201 @entity202 vs @entity203 @entity1 vs @entity117 @entity204 vs @entity205 ties to be played march 7 and 8			1
as @entity209 's players celebrated wildly , @entity1 's players took their positions for the restart looking a little stunned			1
it 's hard to say why			0
these type of episodes have , after all , become rather too familiar over recent months			0
briefly , @entity100 was staring at his own @entity216 moment			0
it was defeat in @entity219 almost a year ago that signalled @entity221 for @entity100 's predecessor @entity222			0
there would have been no such threat to the current @entity1 manager had they lost here but this was a performance that was shaping up to be every bit as lame as that one in @entity231			2
as it was , @entity1 did find something from somewhere			2
@entity100 certainly helped , taking @entity78 off and sending on @entity40			1
a change of shape released @entity34 further forwards and that , in the end , proved to be effective			2
@entity238 ( right ) bends a free - kick up and over @entity20 's wall but wide of @entity33 's left - hand post @entity20 striker @entity64 ( centre ) attempts to weave his way past @entity1 duo @entity73 ( left ) and @entity164 @entity78 ( left ) is sent tumbling to the turf by a mistimed challenge from @entity246 central defender @entity56 @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 ( @entity250 ) watch the action from inside the @entity253 's studio at @entity3 @entity23 previously went 12 games without a goal between dec 2005 and feb 2006 in all comps , totalling 1003 minutes : dec 2005 : sat 31 – @entity257 ( @entity258 ) 4 - 1 @entity259 : tues 3 – @entity117 ( a ) 0 - 0 sun 8 – @entity261 ( a ) 0 - 0 weds 11 – @entity201 ( a ) 1 - 1 sat 14 – @entity263 ( a ) 1 - 3 sun 22 – @entity200 ( @entity258 ) 1 - 0 wed 25 – @entity201 ( @entity258 ) 2 - 1 sun 29 – @entity266 ( a ) 3 - 0 feb 2006 : wed 1 – @entity201 ( a ) 3 - 4 sat 4 – @entity267 ( @entity258 ) 4 - 2 @entity268 – @entity269 ( a ) 3 - 1 sat 18 – @entity200 ( a ) 0 - 1 for a while , not much changed			1
@entity20 seemed buoyed by their goal and seemed intent on scoring a second			0
sometimes , though , you need something to go your way and @entity1 got a small break on the way to their equaliser in the 65th minute			0
@entity20 seemed secure enough as @entity282 and @entity40 funnelled the ball through the middle but when @entity43 sought to beat a @entity20 defender to the ball he had the determination and presence to force it in to the corner past goalkeeper @entity33 from ten yards			1
it was a peculiar goal but , for @entity1 , it was hugely important			0
equally important , and impressive , was the manner in which they managed to find another gear from that point on			0
@entity20 did n't disappear from the game completely			0
@entity64 , for instance , brought a plunging save from @entity173 with a decent header			0
@entity1 , though , managed to establish themselves as the genuinely dominant force and for the first time they brought a cutting edge too			2
@entity34 's influence was growing and @entity1 had the intelligence to play to that strength			1
the @entity307 is becoming increasingly effective as a ' @entity308 ' and when his header from an @entity164 cross was saved by @entity33 in the 72nd minute he lashed the loose ball across goal and high in to the corner with a certain amount of glee			0
with that , the game seemed over and @entity20 's race run			2
they had enjoyed a sight of glory but good teams can ruin things like that pretty quickly and @entity1 , for all their issues , remain clinical when it matters			0
there was still time for @entity23 to score , his penalty coming after @entity33 dashed from goal to floor him rather recklessly			2
there were subsequent suggestions of a dive but that was something of a side issue			0
@entity1 's weird season rolls on			1
it may yet end at @entity337			0
@entity34 reacts after being caught in the face by an elbow from @entity20 defender @entity56 early in the first half former @entity38 midfielder @entity34 was left with a bloody nose after the incident but @entity56 was not shown a card referee @entity89 watches on as @entity43 ( left ) and @entity61 tussle for the ball during the first half at @entity3 former @entity347 striker @entity64 smashes the ball through @entity73 's legs to record the game 's first shot on target @entity1 captain @entity23 ( left ) challenges @entity20 skipper @entity55 during a goalless opening period @entity62 ( left ) brings down @entity1 midfielder @entity43 to earn the first yellow card of the night from referee @entity89 @entity20 striker @entity64 climbs all over @entity74 to head the ball in the direction of @entity22 's goal			1

@entity21 gave @entity20 the lead after 47 minutes when his deflected effort caught out @entity22
@entity43 equalised for the *visitors* on 65 minutes with a low , curling effort into the bottom corner
@entity34 completed @entity1 's comeback when he poked home from close - range
@entity23 won a penalty late on and scored it to seal @entity1 's *progress* to the last eight of the @entity10
it was the first time he has scored in 952 minutes of action for @entity1
@entity78 was *replaced* by @entity40 on the hour mark after another *disappointing* performance
@entity1 will host @entity10 *holders* @entity117 at @entity133 in the quarter - finals of the *competition*
