by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 insists he did not make a mistake resting @entity5 in the defeat to @entity7 but the teenager will be straight back in the starting line - up for their @entity11 opener			1
@entity5 has emerged as a key player for the @entity13 over the last 10 months but having played 180 minutes in @entity15 's two matches last week he was benched for the 1 - 0 loss to @entity7			1
he was introduced after an hour with @entity3 struggling to break down their opponents but even he could not unlock a resilient @entity7 rearguard			1
video : scroll down to see @entity2 reflect on a disappointing result @entity5 had to settle for a brief appearance on saturday evening against @entity7 substitute @entity5 had 30 minutes to make an impact at @entity23 but failed to deliver the 19 - year - old will be back in the team for tuesday 's visit of @entity28 outsiders @entity29 as @entity2 looks to get the club 's return to @entity33 's elite off to a flying start			1
but the @entity35 stressed that did not mean he got it wrong against @entity7			1
' we have an exciting couple of months and this was a game i felt we could do that , ' he said			2
' if he did n't have international football then it would have been the case			2
' he is a big player for us but we have built a squad here where i have to trust all the players but as a team and a squad we did n't deliver			2
' he will certainly play on tuesday night			0
' @entity2 did n't look amused , as he watched from the sidelines at @entity23 @entity7 striker @entity54 scored the only goal of the game in the 9th minute @entity3 's starting @entity58 contained five summer signings - with midfielder @entity60 making his debut after an injury in pre-season - but @entity2 said that was not the reason for defeat			1
' we had new players against @entity68 ( whom they beat 3 - 0 before the international break ) and we were outstanding , ' he said			1
' the players we have brought in are very good players and i am delighted with them but we just failed to open them ( @entity7 ) up			2
' we just lacked that bit of quality			0
we have seen many games here where we ended up with 15 - 20 shots on target but that did n't happen			2
' for some time @entity3 's achilles heel has been set - pieces and they conceded from another when from an avoidable corner @entity84 's header created enough confusion for @entity54 to score			1
@entity84 had a couple of opportunities to double their lead in the first half but also escaped punishment for what looked like a kick at @entity94			0
@entity94 constantly found himself on the end of rough treatment from @entity84 at @entity23 @entity5 played a starring role in @entity15 's win over @entity99 on monday after the break @entity3 stepped up the pressure but the closest they came to an equaliser was when @entity104 curled a shot against the post			1
defender @entity107 admits conceding like they did is a painful experience			0
' it hurts for everyone , especially for the defence , especially when you see the game and they did n't have many chances , ' he told @entity117			0
' they are really good at corners and that was their only chance but we have lost the three points			0
' @entity2 hopes the return of the @entity11 will give his side the chance to bounce back			1
' this game has gone and we now have to focus on that , ' he said			0
' there is nothing better than to get going again on tuesday night in a competition we love			0
' hopefully we can start that competition with three points			0
' @entity2 insisted that leaving @entity5 out of his starting eleven was the right decision @entity7 boss @entity138 , who has two wins and a draw from his last three visits to @entity23 , believes the faith he placed in the club 's young talent a couple of years ago is now starting to pay off			1
' the young lads are not young any more , they have grown into men and it was a massive three points , ' he said after his side went second in the @entity149 with their third victory			0
' @entity152 ( signed on loan from @entity154 ) was outstanding , @entity151 carried on where he left off the other night ( for @entity15 ) and @entity156 is a lad who is unfairly not spoken about because his performances have been excellent			2
' we are only four games in but we have had a fabulous start			0
any given day you can win a game but it has been a big start and having lads that are playing at the top of their game certainly helps you			0
