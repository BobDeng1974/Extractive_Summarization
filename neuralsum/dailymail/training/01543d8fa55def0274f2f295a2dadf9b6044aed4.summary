by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 09:03 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 12 august 2013 the @entity6 's controversial ' stop and frisk ' crime - fighting tactics violate the @entity7 , a federal judge ruled on monday			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 said the city police adopted a policy of ' indirect racial profiling ' by targeting racially defined groups for stops			1
@entity9 said she was not putting an end to the policy , but rather was reforming it			2
she did not give specifics yet on how that would work but instead named an independent monitor who would develop an initial set of reforms to the policies , training , supervision , monitoring and discipline			2
' the city 's highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner , ' she wrote			0
' in their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective , they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting " the right people " is racially discriminatory			0
the @entity6 's controversial ' stop and frisk ' crime - fighting tactics violate the @entity7 , a federal judge said monday four men ( not pictured ) sued the @entity6 in 2004 , saying they were unfairly targeted because of their race police brass received warnings since at least 1999 that officers were violating rights , she said			1
' despite this notice , they deliberately maintained and even escalated policies and practices that predictably resulted in even more widespread @entity63 violations , ' she wrote in a lengthy opinion			0
she also cited violations of the @entity63 protection against unreasonable search and seizure			0
' far too many people in @entity47 have been deprived of this basic freedom far too often , ' she said			0
' the @entity6 's practice of making stops that lack individualized reasonable suspicion has been so pervasive and persistent as to become not only a part of the @entity6 's standard operating procedure , but a fact of daily life in some @entity47 neighborhoods			1
' four men sued the department in 2004 , saying they were unfairly targeted because of their race			1
there have been about 5 million stops during the past decade , mostly black and @entity83 men			1
@entity9 issued her ruling after a 10 - week bench trial , which included testimony from top @entity6 brass and a dozen people — 11 men and one woman — who said they were wrongly stopped because of their race			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 ( pictured ) said the city police adopted a policy of ' indirect racial profiling ' by targeting racially defined groups for stops stop and frisk is a constitutional police tactic , but @entity9 concluded that the plaintiffs had ' readily established that the @entity6 implements its policies regarding stop and frisk in a manner that intentionally discriminates based on race			1
' she said , through paperwork alone , she determined at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion , the necessary legal benchmark , lower than the standard of probable cause needed to justify an arrest			1
the class - action lawsuit was the largest and most broad legal action against the policy at the nation 's biggest police department , and it may have an effect on how other police departments make street stops , legal experts said			2
lawmakers have also sought to create an independent monitor and make it easier for people to sue the department if they feel their civil rights were violated			1
those bills are awaiting an override vote after the mayor vetoed the legislation			0
the city had no immediate response to the ruling			0
city lawyers argued the department does a good job policing itself with an internal affairs bureau , a civilian complaint board and quality assurance divisions			0
' the city and its highest officials believe that blacks and @entity145 should be stopped at the same rate as their proportion of the local criminal suspect population , ' she wrote			0
' but this reasoning is flawed because the stopped population is overwhelmingly innocent — not criminal			0
' @entity9 appointed @entity151 , the city 's former lead attorney and previously a chief assistant district attorney , as the monitor			2
in both roles , @entity151 worked closely with the @entity6 , the judge said			2
he did not respond to a call seeking comment .			0
