@entity0 admitted he ' enjoyed the ride ' as he won and extended his championship lead at a wet @entity3 - but it was a serious injury to @entity5 's @entity4 which overshadowed the @entity7 @entity6			1
rain had long - threatened the running of a grand prix which could yet prove pivotal in @entity12 's title battle with @entity16 team - mate and pole sitter @entity13 as the @entity17 outpaced his nearest rival to finish the shortened race in front			1
a red flag had stopped the action after just two laps as - despite starting the race behind the safety car - the heavy rain being pushed over @entity3 by @entity26 continued to fall			1
@entity0 said he and his @entity29 colleagues are praying for @entity4 who was injured on sunday once the race had restarted there followed a prolonged dry spell during which time @entity0 caught and passed @entity13 on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance			1
the race would not be completed , however , as the rain returned and saw driving conditions deteriorate , with @entity4 crashing out late on to see the red flags return			1
the 25 - year - old @entity39 aquaplaned and left the track in the same place where @entity43 's @entity42 had suffered a similar fate on the previous lap. @entity4 was understood to have crashed into the recovery vehicle that was in the process of removing @entity42 's car and , with an ambulance deployed , the race was halted after 44 laps and @entity0 declared the winner			1
@entity4 was taken to hospital after crashing in wet conditions at the @entity7 @entity6 medics rush to the aid of @entity39 driver @entity4 after an accident during the @entity7 @entity6 - his @entity5 car spun off the track and hit a recovery vehicle the victory moves the 2008 champion 10 points ahead of @entity13 with four races remaining but @entity0 , as well as all of his fellow drivers , was subdued in the aftermath of @entity4 's incident which had seen the @entity5 driver knocked unconscious and taken to hospital			1
' it 's been an interesting weekend , ' said @entity0			2
' our first thoughts go to @entity73 - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him			2
next to this , the race result does n't seem significant at all			0
' generally the car was absolutely fantastic through the race and once i passed @entity13 i was able to really manage the gap and enjoy the ride			2
obviously it did n't finish the way we would have hoped but really , my prayers are with @entity4 and his family			2
' @entity13 , who could not convert an eighth pole position of the season into the win which would have put him top of the standings , conceded @entity0 had been better than him on the day			2
' congratulations to @entity0 for winning today , ' he said			0
' of course my thoughts at the moment are with our colleague @entity97 because it seems quite serious , so i really wish him all the best			0
' all in all , @entity0 just did a better job than me today and deserves to win			0
second place is damage limitation and taking everything into consideration , it was very difficult conditions ... so seven points lost to @entity0 , there is worse than that			0
' @entity110 completed the podium on the weekend the four - time world champion revealed he would be leaving @entity113 at the end of the season			0
he edged out team - mate @entity116 who finished fourth ahead of the @entity118 of @entity119 , who had profited from an early pit - stop onto the quicker intermediate tyre			0
@entity4 's father told @entity39 television that his son 's condition is ' critical ' and he is undergoing surgery for head injuries			0
the 25 - year - old is pictured doing a lap of the rain soaked track before the race the @entity135 pair of @entity136 and @entity137 finished sixth and seventh respectively , whilst @entity138 and @entity139 also scored points - with the @entity141 of @entity142 sandwiched between the @entity144 duo in ninth , despite having taken a 10 - place grid penalty for a new power unit			1
@entity148 has been announced as @entity110 's replacement for 2015 and the sister @entity141 came home 11th ahead of the sole - remaining @entity152 of @entity153 as @entity154 retired early on with an electrical fault			0
@entity156 came home a respectable 13th for @entity43 , with the second @entity118 of @entity158 also finishing ahead of the @entity159 ' of @entity160 and pastor @entity161			0
@entity162 took 17th place for @entity164 , with @entity4 's team - mate @entity165 18th and home favourite @entity166 bringing up the rear .			1
