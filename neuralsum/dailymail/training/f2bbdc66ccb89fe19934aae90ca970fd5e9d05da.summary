@entity3 , which is fighting to salvage its reputation after a string of scandals , will unveil the plans after its financial results tomorrow , when it counts the cost of its wrongdoing			1
it is expected to slash up to 2,000 ‘ casino bankers ’ at its investment arm @entity33 as part of a shake - up			1
but in its most eye - catching bid to convince the public that it is improving its culture , it will also announce the closure of its structured capital markets business			1
this secretive division helps companies avoid tax through a network of offshore tax havens and was previously run by its highest - paid banker @entity45			1
but it has also been used by @entity3 to cut its own tax bill in the @entity47 , heaping pressure on ordinary households to bridge the £ 32billion annual shortfall in @entity52 ’ coffers			2
last year it was ordered by the @entity53 to repay half a billion pounds after being caught out using two ‘ aggressive ’ loopholes to avoid paying tax			0

the old ways were n’t the right way to behave nor did they deliver the right results – for banks themselves or for wider society			2

’ the move comes amid fresh accusations that @entity3 helped clients avoid tax on an ‘ industrial ’ scale			2

scandal : the closure is part of mr @entity2 ' drive to ' shred ' the legacy left by former boss @entity15 who resigned following the bank 's £ 290 million libor rigging settlement last year ‘ some tax restructuring is common in a lot of banks , and there ’s nothing wrong with it			1
the issue is they turned it into an industry within the bank			2
’ the tax avoidance arm was run by @entity45 , a former boyfriend of supermodel @entity122 , who made as much as £ 40million a year before leaving the bank in 2009			0
