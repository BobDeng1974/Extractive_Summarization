by @entity1 reporter published : 12:12 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:14 est , 18 february 2014 at just eight weeks old , tiny @entity4 was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition			1
and just six months later , her parents were given the heartbreaking news that she would die if she did n’t get a transplant			1
but after battling from the brink of death several times , and thanks to her uncle @entity14 who donated part of his liver , she is now thriving			1
@entity4 was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition until her uncle , @entity14 , donated part of his liver to her @entity4 and mr @entity14 will end up having full - sized livers due to the organ 's remarkable ability to regenerate itself			1
both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor 's liver are able to regrow into a normal - sized liver			2
@entity4 's mother , @entity27 , 24 , said : ' @entity4 would not have survived without a new liver			1
' everything she does is down to @entity14 , i ca n’t thank him enough			2
i do n’t think she would be here now if it was n’t for him			0
' from being at the hospital all that time , it ’s wonderful to be home as a family			0
it ’s nice to see @entity4 playing - i never thought that would happen			2
' mr @entity14 , who is ms @entity38 ' brother , said : ' i did n’t think twice when i heard they were looking for family members as potential donors			1
' i was n’t nervous beforehand - i think my mum and @entity27 were more nervous than me , i was just thinking about @entity4			2
i think i will hold it over her when she ’s older and she ’s being naughty , mind ! ' @entity4 had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which affects one in 16,000 newborns the type of transplant @entity4 had is called a living donor liver transplant			1
this is where a section of liver is removed from a living donor – because the liver can regenerate itself			1
this means both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor 's liver are able to regrow into a normal - sized liver			2
within six weeks of donating part of his liver , mr @entity14 's liver had grown back to its original size			1
@entity4 was born after a normal pregnancy on june 22 , 2012			2
' when she came out she was perfect and everything was normal at first , ' said ms leather , who lives with partner @entity70 , 39 , in @entity71 , @entity72			0
' she was a bit jaundiced and her eyes were yellow , but we were told it was nothing to worry about			0
' at eight weeks old she was weighed and they said she should n’t still be yellow , so we were told to take her to hospital			0
' medics at @entity81 ’s @entity80 ran a series of blood tests			0
the family was then told the devastating news that @entity4 had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which affects one in 16,000 newborns			1
she was rushed to @entity89 and underwent a nine - and - a - half hour operation as surgeons tried to reconstruct the tract by which bile is secreted by the liver			0
mother - of - six ms @entity27 said : ' she went down at midday and i saw her again at 9.30pm			0
last summer @entity97 @entity14 underwent his operation at @entity99 in @entity100 - 20 minutes away from @entity89 where @entity4 was operated on ' it was horrendous - my tiny eight - week - old baby had a massive scar across her belly and a big breathing tube			1
' @entity4 stayed in hospital for two weeks before she was allowed home , but sadly the procedure did not work			1
' at eight months old , she was only 12lbs , she was absolutely tiny , ' says ms leather			0
' she had a feeding tube but nothing worked			0
' doctors then decided she needed to go on the transplant list			2
several members of her family put themselves forward to see if they were suitable donors and in may 2013 , mr @entity14 was confirmed as a match			1
he underwent his op at @entity99 ’ @entity117 in @entity100 - 20 minutes away from @entity89 where @entity4 was operated on			2
the 23 - year - old donated part of his liver and spent five days in hospital recovering			0
despite having to have eight weeks off work , @entity14 has not had any long - lasting side - effects , as the liver re-grows within six weeks			1
willow with her family , including her mother , @entity27			0
both @entity4 and her uncle will end up with full - sized livers , due to the organ 's remarkable ability to regenerate itself but although his operation went well , @entity4 - who underwent 11 and a half hours of surgery - was rushed back into theatre after a blood clot was detected			1
after another two weeks in hospital , @entity4 was finally allowed home			1
@entity4 , who is on five types of medication including anti-rejection drugs and steroids , now has to have regular check - ups			0
and though she is small for her age and has some development delays , the 20 - month - old is on the mend - although there is always chance she will reject her new liver			0
despite this worry , her mother said : ' she only weighs 16lbs and ca n’t walk yet , but she is so happy and smiley , she hardly ever cries			0
she added : ' the medical team at @entity100 were absolutely brilliant			0
i could n’t fault them			0

@entity4 was battling rare liver disease called biliary atresia
doctors warned that without a transplant , she would die
family members were tested and uncle @entity14 , 23 , was a match
liver donations are possible from living donors due to the organ 's remarkable ability to regenerate itself in a matter of weeks
