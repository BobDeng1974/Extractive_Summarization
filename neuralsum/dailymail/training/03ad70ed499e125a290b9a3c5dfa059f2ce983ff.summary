it sounds like the stuff of @entity3 fiction			0
but a pill that wipes out bad memories could eventually become reality , scientists believe			0
experiments on mice found those given fingolimod , a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis , completely forgot about previous experiences that had brought them physical pain			1
the @entity18 study , at @entity16 , offers hope of a drug that could eradicate memories of traumatic events from years ago and help patients overcome phobias , eating disorders and even sexual hang - ups			1
experiments on mice found those given fingolimod , a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis , completely forgot about previous experiences that had brought them physical pain ( stock image ) it mirrors the film @entity35 , which starred @entity36 and @entity37 , in which a couple used a technique to erase memories of each other when their relationship soured			1
@entity44 , available as a tablet under the brand name @entity44 , treats remitting forms of @entity48 by suppressing the immune system			0
dr @entity50 , of the @entity16 , @entity18 , and colleagues found it can also inhibit an enzyme called histone deacetylase , a key protein that regulates gene expression			1
when fed to mice , fingolimod crossed the blood brain barrier and helped them quickly forget recent unpleasant episodes			1
they were put in a chamber where their feet were exposed to a mild electric shock , and when returned to the cage their ‘ freezing ’ behaviour was recorded as a measure of anxiety			0
this complete lack of movement , a characteristic fear response in rodents providing a good readout of memory , subsided rapidly after receiving the drug			2
the findings mirror the film @entity35 , pictured , in which a couple used a technique to erase memories of each other when their relationship soured dr @entity50 said : ' fingolimod , a @entity83 approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis , has beneficial effects in the central nervous system that are not yet well understood			2
' @entity44 deserves consideration as an adjuvant therapy for post traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders			2
' in theory , such a pill could eradicate memories of traumatic events that happened years ago			1
but there are ethical concerns that it could eradicate the very essence of what makes us human as well as have damaging psychological consequences , preventing those who take it from learning from their mistakes			0
the ability to remove memories has been the stuff of science fiction for decades .			0

mice given fingolimod forgot about previous experiences that brought pain
