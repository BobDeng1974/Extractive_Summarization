for the first time since 50,000 @entity3 hissed their deafening disapproval and forced him to retreat to his dugout , @entity1 manager @entity0 returned to @entity6			1
after five minutes he made his first tentative steps into the technical area which had been the scene of his public persecution three months ago			0
given the sedate setting of a pre-season friendly , however , he escaped a repeat of such vitriol			0
has the passage of the summer and the arrival of nine signings won @entity0 a reprieve ? does he feel relations have been repaired ? we do not know , for the club are refusing to allow their boss to speak to the press , and therefore the fans			1
he did offer — via his programme notes — that he was happy with the ‘ healthy ’ nature of his squad			0
but that team barely raised a pulse during a subdued and sodden 90 minutes which left fans pining for the start of competitive action			2
that comes on sunday when champions @entity56 visit @entity6 ’ , and only then will we get a measure of fans ’ forgiveness			2
for the feeling on @entity61 is that they remain ready to turn , regardless of new investment			0
@entity0 , though , is happy with the £ 35million backing from owner @entity65 this close - season , as he wrote : ‘ we came up short at times last season , but everyone has worked hard to ensure we have a team that will represent this great club in a fitting manner over the coming months , and i ’m relishing the prospect of what lies ahead			1
slide : @entity74 slides in for a tackle during the first half against @entity77 pain : @entity74 goes down after a heavy challenge during @entity1 's final pre-season friendly escape : @entity24 skips away from @entity82 during the match at @entity6 tackle : @entity25 puts in a tackle on @entity24 , not something the creative midfielder is renowned for transfer : new signing @entity89 goes in for a challenge rather tentatively ‘ the squad we have assembled is healthy in terms of numbers , experience and quality and that is all any manager can ask for when he is looking ahead to a long and arduous marathon			1
’ @entity101 and arduous was one way to describe yesterday ’s friendly			0
for even by pre-season standards it was a tedious affair			0
@entity20 was the match - winner following a dreadful performance which was about as far removed as imaginable from his impressive showing at the @entity109 with @entity110			1
with two minutes remaining @entity111 attacked the by - line and drew back to @entity20 ’s unmarked feet on the edge of the area			1
given how he had performed until that point , those in the @entity118 would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover			0
but @entity20 kept his composure and produced the game ’s one moment of quality , tucking into the bottom corner with authority			2
next sunday against @entity56 should feature five full debutants from their summer splurge but @entity0 can afford no bedding - in period with those new faces			2
the pressure will be on from the off and , unable to communicate with the fans except via sanitised , official outlets , his existence could again be a lonely one should results not go his way			0
skipper @entity138 certainly feels the arrival of new faces has reinvigorated a squad which , in light of @entity144 ’s £ 20m sale in january and no subsequent investment , had grown disillusioned with the direction of the club			0
@entity1 have greater attacking threat - @entity0 manager : @entity0 will be hoping for a better season than last , which trailed off in the second half forward : @entity154 signed this summer from @entity156 side @entity157 battle : former @entity159 midfielder @entity111 tussles with @entity160 celebration : @entity20 after scoring his side 's 88th minute winner , @entity111 assisted the goal respect : @entity166 and referee @entity167 share a joke during the game at @entity170 ‘ the new arrivals have given everyone a lift , ’ he said			1
‘ they are good guys and , most importantly , they are good players who have added even more quality to the team			0
’ @entity89 looks the pick of them and the @entity110 midfielder was again the stand - out performer against @entity77			2
the 23 - year - old brings guile and energy to a side sadly lacking in both departments last season and he could well be the next player to use the @entity186 as a launchpad to greater things			1
in the meantime @entity0 will be looking to @entity190 — and the likes of former @entity193 captain @entity192 and @entity195 defender @entity194 — to win him a few friends among the @entity3			1
for while he is unhappy with the silence imposed upon him by the club ’s hierarchy , should the home fans remain equally muted when he returns to his technical zone against @entity56 , @entity0 will be a relieved man .			1

@entity0 was back in the home dugout for the first time since he was booed by fans in may
@entity20 's late goal won it for the @entity186 in a drab affair
@entity194 and @entity89 both impressed for the home side
