the @entity1 meeting : @entity2 with the @entity3 in the capital in 2001 prince @entity5 tonight issued a dramatic and unprecedented denial that he slept with the woman at the centre of the extraordinary under - age ‘ sex slave ’ scandal			1
for the first time , @entity12 made a robust rebuttal of the allegations by @entity2 that she was forced to have sex with the @entity5 in @entity1 , @entity17 and the @entity18 , starting when she was only 17			1
in a shock move tonight , the @entity3 came out fighting against the woman whose allegations have dogged him for more than three years			2
a @entity12 spokesman said in a statement to @entity23 : ‘ it is emphatically denied that the @entity5 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity2			1
‘ any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation			0
’ according to royal sources , the dramatic statement marks the beginning of a determined attempt to demolish the bombshell allegations made by @entity36 , who served as a masseuse to the @entity3 ’s billionaire paedophile friend @entity38 for four years			1
insiders insist there is not a shred of truth in her attempt to drag the prince into the sordid affair by naming him in @entity48 court papers uncovered on friday , and so they had little option but to deny it publicly as his reputation is at stake			1
‘ there is nothing that the @entity5 cares more about than his reputation , which is why he decided to make this unprecedented denial of any impropriety , ’ said a friend			1
prince @entity5 resigned as the government ’s global trade envoy and apologised for his former friendship with mr @entity38 when the scandal first broke three years ago , and a picture emerged of the prince with his arm around the teenage miss @entity2			1
since then , he has devoted his time to business and charity initiatives including encouraging entrepreneurs and apprenticeships			0
the strongly worded denial goes much further than the limited statement issued by the palace on friday – which did not refer to @entity36 ’ name or mention sex or a relationship – and is the most personal statement issued in recent years on behalf of senior royal			1
it came after top @entity80 law professor @entity79 , who was also accused by @entity36 of having sex with her , made a forceful attack on the claims			0
he said : ‘ this person has made this up out of cloth , maliciously and knowingly in order to extort money from mr @entity38			0
’ the lawyer told @entity90 ’s today programme on saturday that he would not rest until he had shown that the claims regarding his conduct were false and he advised the @entity5 to do everything in his power to clear his name			2
@entity103 , prince @entity5 with former friend @entity38 in 2011 ‘ my only feeling is , if she ’s lied about me , which i know to an absolute certainty she has , she should not be believed about anyone else , ’ he said			0
‘ we know she ’s lied about other public figures , including a former prime minister and others who she claims to have participated in sexual activities with , so i think it must be presumed all her allegations against prince @entity5 were false as well			2
' you can not allow these allegations to hang above you			0
you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you			0
’ on a day of high drama , the @entity12 issue two bombshell statements to the @entity23 due to doubts over whether prince @entity5 was denying @entity2 ’s account in its totality , @entity23 asked the @entity12 to confirm or deny that the @entity3 had had any sexual contact with @entity2			1
their first answer left some ambiguity , then came the dramatic second statement proclaiming his innocence			0
palace statement at 5.04pm ... a very serious allegation , of sex with a minor , was levelled at the @entity5 in a legal document submitted to a @entity48 court			2
the earlier statement categorically rejected that claim ; and as was indicated at the time , we do not intend to comment further			0
... and at 7.40pm it is emphatically denied that the @entity5 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity2			2
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation			0
