radical bid : the prime minister is intending to stop printing foreign - language paperwork @entity3 plans to strip welfare handouts from immigrants who can not speak @entity6			1
in a radical bid to slash @entity10 ’s benefits bill , the prime minister intends to stop printing welfare paperwork in foreign languages and prevent claimants using taxpayer - funded translators at benefits offices			1
the move – which would also hit @entity10 residents who can not speak @entity6 – was due to be announced tomorrow , but has been delayed following a row with @entity19			1
tories hope that axeing foreign - language versions of documents explaining how to claim benefits would make it harder for immigrants such as newly arrived @entity26 and @entity27 to cash in on the @entity10 ’s benefits system , encourage others already here to learn @entity6 – and save money spent on translators			1
referring to the controversial @entity35 programme , one @entity33 aide said : ‘ the @entity37 culture must end			1
’ the plans were been drawn up by @entity41 @entity40			1
one @entity33 insider said : ‘ the vast majority of voters will think this idea is plain common sense			0
it is unreasonable to expect taxpayers to spend huge sums on translators when people should be learning to read and write @entity6			0
’ former @entity33 cabinet minister @entity52 also gave the scheme the thumbs - up , saying : ‘ the principle is a good one but it needs to be introduced in a way that ’s fair and reasonable			1
if it is , it will meet with general public approval			0
the ability to speak @entity6 is one of the most empowering tools in the labour market and we should be encouraging as many people as possible to learn it			0
’ the announcement of the changes was delayed after a behind - the - scenes dispute between the @entity70 partners – just the latest in a series of clashes between mr @entity3 and deputy prime minister mr @entity19			1
communicating : immigrants getting help from civil servants in @entity76 but @entity33 sources say they are ‘ optimistic ’ the changes will be confirmed later this week if the @entity79 can be won over			1
one official involved in the plan said : ‘ @entity3 and @entity40 are very enthusiastic about it , but the @entity79 had a wobble			0
they are nervous of being portrayed as being too harsh on immigrants			1
’ @entity87 ’s @entity86 , chairman of the @entity88 ’ home affairs committee , also expressed reservations saying : ‘ in principle , it is a good idea , but it could cost the taxpayer more because if people are refused benefit and have a genuine claim , they will sue the government			0
’ at present the inability of claimants to speak or write @entity6 is no bar to them obtaining benefits			0
translation services are available in all @entity103 while local councils provide information leaflets in dozens of different languages			2
latest figures show the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) spends £ 5 million on language services a year			0
the vast majority , £ 4.5 million , is spent on face - to - face and telephone help , with £ 415,000 more on ‘ document translation ’			2
scrapped : a multilingual form used by @entity116 borough council the @entity108 used interpreters 271,695 times in the space of one year to assist foreign claimants , statistics released under the @entity122 show			2
most of the money is paid to @entity125 , @entity10 ’s biggest language services firm , which received £ 3.5 million in public money during 2011			0
benefits offices deal with more than 140 languages , including @entity129 and @entity130 as well as the more common @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			2
town halls such as @entity116 in @entity137 publish guides on how to claim benefits in foreign languages which would be paid for separately to the @entity108 figures			1
in most cases , a claimant at a @entity103 would be put on the phone to an interpreter at a call centre to help them complete forms			0
the service receives up to 22,000 calls a month and is usually able to provide an interpreter within 60 seconds			0
there is also a service for face - to - face meetings , used 13,000 times a year			2
anger : one @entity33 aide said the ' @entity37 culture needs to end ' , referring to the recent documentary on @entity35 tories and @entity79 have fallen out over several immigration and welfare issues			1
in october , home secretary @entity163 was forced to scrap sending vans with signs telling illegal immigrants to go home to areas with large ethnic populations			2
the two parties are at odds over mrs may ’s plan to cut annual immigration from the @entity175 to 75,000 a year			0
and they disagree over whether immigrants make the @entity10 better or worse off			1
mr @entity19 has denounced chancellor @entity179 ’s pledge to slash another £ 10 billion from the welfare budget			0
and the @entity79 leader vetoed a move by mr @entity3 to scrap housing benefit for under 25s			0
taking advantage : the new guidelines will make it harder for immigrants such as newly arrived @entity26 and @entity27 ( pictured boarding coaches to the @entity10 ) to cash in on the benefits system the latest proposed crackdown reflects the influence of @entity193 - born @entity33 election chief @entity192			1
mr @entity192 is said to have given orders that the party must produce ‘ a new policy to curb immigrants and benefits ’ every week			2
growing public pressure for a tougher approach to curb the @entity10 ’s ‘ handout culture ’ , as highlighted on @entity35 ’s @entity37 series , is reflected in a policy switch @entity87 is set to announce this week			1
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity204 is expected to say that welfare handouts should be linked more closely to how much people have paid into the system			0
it could lead to higher payments for most adults , but lower payments to under - 25s .			0
