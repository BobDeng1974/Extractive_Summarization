@entity0 has been pictured smiling for the cameras alongside @entity3 dancers with blacked - up faces			1
the prime minister happily posed for photographers with his daughter @entity7 at the @entity8			1
the picture is likely to prove controversial , with the tradition of having blacked - up faces branded racist in the past			2
@entity0 holds his daughter @entity7 as he poses for photographs with @entity15 mr @entity0 and his family attended the annual event on saturday			1
@entity18 , founder and @entity19 of the @entity21 dancers , said it had been a ' wonderful weekend of dancing '			2
writing on the @entity24 , he said : ' lovely dance spots with welcome refreshments provided			0
and a great concert on friday			0
' some bloke who lives in @entity29 joined us on saturday , and @entity31 ( @entity32 ) stopped for a few words on sunday			1
' referring to mr @entity0 's appearance at the event , mr @entity18 added : ' his politics are not my politics but happy for @entity8 to gain some publicity to ensure its future ... although it might have the opposite effect ! ' mr @entity0 is in @entity43 today , meeting students at the @entity45 to promote a new crackdown on education standards the group insists the tradition is not racist			1
they stress that it stretches back five centuries and refers to when unemployed farm labourers would cover their faces in soot while begging for money to avoid being recognised			1
mr @entity18 told the @entity57 : ' it 's not racist and offence is never taken			0
people from other cultural backgrounds do n't see it as that at all			0
we have had an @entity66 person dancing with us in the past - it 's not seen as racist			0
' the @entity3 was started in 1999 and is based at @entity68 in @entity69 , where mr @entity70 is headteacher			0
a @entity29 source reiterated the explanation from the group about the origins of the blacking - up tradition			1
' the organisation itself says it 's nothing to do with racism , ' the source added			0
earlier this year an ale featuring @entity3 dancers with blacked - up faces was rejected by a bar in the houses of @entity85 because the pump badge was deemed to be offensive			2
@entity88 mp @entity87 had nominated a beer from the @entity90 intended to celebrate the @entity91 from nearby @entity92 , who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area 's mining heritage			0
but a spokesman for the @entity97 said : ' the ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence			0
' heritage : a ' @entity103 ' , part of the history of the small @entity107 town of @entity92 the @entity3 group insists the tradition is not racist			1
they say they are reviving a tradition associated with @entity114 dancing , in which @entity116 dancers on the @entity118 border used fire - blackened cork to disguise themselves when they went begging in the streets more than five centuries ago			1
when money was scarce in the winter months they would dance but have to disguise themselves			2
it was necessary to use a disguise to avoid arrest for begging			1
each dancer also makes his or her own tattercoat which is made from rags			0
this reflects the origins of border morris dancing in poor rural communities who had to make good use of every resource the @entity91 , known as the ' nutters ' , are part of the history of the small @entity107 town of @entity92			0
every @entity142 saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs , with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other			2
they perform folk dances , which are said to have originated with moorish pirates			0
the custom of blackened faces , reflects , according to their website , a ' pagan or medieval background ' to ' disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits '			1
it is also thought to link to the town 's mining heritage			0
in april @entity166 , son of the former labour cabinet minister @entity167 , defended posting a photograph on @entity169 celebrating an @entity142 tradition with @entity3 dancers with blacked - up faces - claiming his critics were ignorant about history			1
mr @entity166 , who has been selected by @entity174 to fight one of the party 's top target seats at next year 's general election , uploaded the tweet after meeting @entity180 on saturday			2
the 32 - year - old responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition ' racist ' - defending the historic performances as a vital piece of local cultural history .			2
