@entity7 targeted three siblings after their 93 - year - old aunt @entity9 died in a rest home without leaving a will			1
the company charged the bereaved family thousands of pounds in expenses before taking a massive cut of their £ 237,342 inheritance , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity18 - based @entity7 billed more than £ 132,000 in commission and expenses the siblings were left with little more than £ 10,000 each - money they still have n’t received			1

following her death in january 2009 mrs @entity9 ’s financial guardian , solicitor @entity42 , contacted @entity7 to administer her will because she had no known family and no will			1
during the trial last month the court heard that the business had racked up more than £ 15,000 in bills before they even contacted mrs @entity9 ’s family			2
@entity52 , prosecuting on behalf of @entity51 , described how two people from beneficiaries limited - company director @entity54 and a female colleague - visited siblings @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 at their homes in @entity61 in october 2009			2
he told the @entity62 , @entity63 , that during meetings over two days the pair refused to tell the relatives who had died or how much the estate was worth			2
mr @entity52 said the relatives were then given a contract to sign which stipulated @entity7 would get a 40 per cent share of any inheritance payout and the family would cover the company ’s expenses			1
if they did n’t sign , the court was told , they would not get anything			0
@entity7 were not represented at the trial at @entity62 and no one from the company attended mr @entity52 said the company charged the siblings £ 3.33 per minute to meet with them over two days			2
other expenses included £ 250 per person per night allowances for overnight stays			2
the company ’s commission and expenses amounted to over £ 132,000 including over £ 7,000 for the family visits			1
mr @entity52 said , @entity7 went on to sub-contract work to other firms which were also run by @entity54 in a ‘ highly artificial , very sophisticated and very cynical way of doing business ’			0
the siblings should have got more than £ 35,000 each but were told they would receive little more than £ 10,700			1
a further two relatives in @entity98 should have received more than £ 50,000 each			2
in total , the company should have paid out £ 213,096 , but as yet they have not paid anything and the money appears to have disappeared			0

the judge was told that it had no assets and was soon to be dissolved			0
@entity54 , of @entity110 , @entity111 , was ruled to be unfit to stand trial last month			0
