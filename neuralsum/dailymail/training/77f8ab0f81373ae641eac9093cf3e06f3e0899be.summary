by @entity0 when @entity1 , a fifty - something from @entity3 , was offered a well - paid job working for a princess from @entity7 's ruling dynasty , she jumped at the chance			1
but less than four months after she arrived in the @entity7 capital @entity10 , she was hustled on to a plane and thrown out of the country - all because she stood up to her abusive employer			1
now back in @entity14 , she has written a book laying bare her experiences at the hands of the @entity7 royals - and sheds light on a side of @entity10 life that is rarely seen by outsiders			1
' a single woman can not even go for a coffee on her own - it 's deemed immoral			2
' you are allowed to walk around a mall but walking around one 's neighbourhood for exercise is heavily frowned upon			0
' difficult though living up to @entity7 's strict moral code proved - a code enforced by religious police known as the @entity45 - her difficulties were nothing compared to what she would experience within the palace itself			2
there , as the head of a team of five staff members including two @entity57 and two @entity25 , she was forced to watch as the princess , who @entity1 has decided not to identify , doled out harsh punishments that included beatings and having their rooms turned upside down , in addition to dealing with the capricious moods of the princess herself			1
' in the beginning the princess seemed to be on her best behaviour although the abuse escalated over time , ' she remembers			2
' it was difficult , at times , not to retaliate when the princess , who was half my age , was screaming at me and telling me what an imbecile i was because she did n't approve of the shoes i was wearing			0
' although @entity1 herself was never physically harmed by the princess , the other maids - the @entity25 in particular - regularly found themselves at the sharp end of the royal 's terrifying temper			1
worse still , thanks to the iqama identity card system which means foreigners can not leave the country without permission from their employers , both @entity25 remain trapped in @entity7 more than two years after their contracts ended			1
' the @entity25 are n't held in high regard by @entity7 in general , ' admits @entity1			1
' i have the utmost respect for these people - not only for their work ethics and for being on call 24/7 without a single day off but also for having the capacity to take the abuse meted out in their stride			2
' abusive : princess @entity101 was arrested in @entity102 in 2001 and accused of beating her servant difficult : life for women is n't always easy in @entity7 who are forbidden to drive among other things one of the worst incidents witnessed by @entity1 involved the princess telling one maid to fetch a bucket of ice , tip it over her head and stand outside her room , dripping and cold , for the entire night			1
' apart from the stories the staff shared with me and the severe bruising i saw following beatings from the princess , this was probably the worst thing i witnessed , ' adds @entity1			1
' the abuse is very real and it happens behind closed doors			0
the public personas of the royals compared to what they are like when no one is looking are worlds apart			0
' as for the exit visas , @entity1 says they are a part of life in @entity7 and all expats working there , including those from the @entity135 , have to have them			1
' you get issued a identity card called an iqama soon after your arrival that is carried with you at all times , ' she explains			0
' everything you do , from buying laptops to your marital status and renting an apartment is documented on this card			0
even traffic offences for men			0
work place : @entity10 has several royal palaces but the biggest and most important belongs to @entity29 ' no one " escapes " from @entity7 as you can only leave once your employer grants you an exit visa and hands your passport back which gets taken away when you arrive			1
' there are thousands of expats working in @entity7 and the iqama is a form of @entity161 's no point being outraged by them - it 's something you have to accept			1
' one thing @entity164 could n't accept , however , was the complete control exercised by her boss over every aspect of her life - including being told details of private conversations between her and her doctor			0
days after telling her doctor of her unhappiness in @entity7 , @entity1 was confronted by her employer - furious at what she saw as a betrayal			1
' it was a lesson in not trusting anyone in @entity7 , ' says @entity1 , who describes the incident as the ' beginning of the end ' of her time in the princess ' employ			1
' i trusted that i would be protected by patient confidentiality but it does n't seem to exist over there			0
' restrictive : @entity7 women are not allowed to do anything without a male relative 's consent eventually , and after several more confrontations , @entity1 's contract was terminated by mutual agreement and she was given an exit visa - a courtesy still yet to be extended to the other domestic staff in the princess ' employ			1
both relieved and upset , she had less than 24 hours to pack her things and say goodbye to the friends she had made among the expat community			0
@entity201 still was saying goodbye to the colony of stray cats she had befriended , in particular because she had had no time to make arrangements for them			0
' i hated the total lack of empathy when it comes to animals , ' she adds			0
' i am a passionate animal lover and found it really traumatising to see the thousands of stray , starving cats that gather around the dustbins in @entity10			2
' cats are seen as pests in @entity7			2
a common practice is to round up as many cats as possible and then release them in the desert where they die horrible deaths			0
' yet despite her experiences , she says she would return to the region - and even @entity7 itself , although not to the capital , @entity10			1
striking : the soaring beauty of the @entity10 skyline conceals some very murky secrets memoir : @entity1 has written a book about her experiences called behind @entity231 ' i would n't go back to @entity10 but some of @entity7 's coastal cities are much more relaxed , ' she reveals			1
' @entity10 is the most conservative city in the whole of the @entity236			2
only black abayas are permitted in @entity10 whereas in the smaller cities , pastel colours are allowed			2
the @entity45 are also much more active in @entity10			2
' and what of the princess herself ? although @entity1 says she would never return to work for her , she does have some kind words for her former employer			1
' from what the princess told me , there were many incidents , perceived or real , where she was hurt in her life			2
' the princess also suffers from depression and is bi-polar , neither of which help matters , but , although it was n't often seen , she has a nurturing side			0
' she loves children as well and i think that part of the reason for her behaviour might be frustration at not being married and having babies of her own			0
' she adds : ' my experience with the princess has n't put me off the idea of working for a royal , although if i did take another contract , i 'd prefer them to be older			0
' i do feel very privileged to have seen a part of the world that is shut off to the rest of society and to have experienced first hand how things are done within the @entity278			0
' even , it seems , if she did n't appreciate all of them			0
@entity283 's memoir , behind @entity231 : life in the @entity285 , is published by @entity286 and costs Â£ 10.95			0

@entity1 , from @entity3 , worked as a butler for a @entity7 princess
was *disgusted* by extent of the abuse , mostly directed at @entity25 maids
eventually left after confronting her employer about treatment of staff
incidents included beatings and rooms being *trashed* as punishment
also saw one maid being forced to tip a bucket of ice over her own head
expats can not leave without being given an exit visa by their employer
as a result , maids with whom @entity1 worked are trapped in @entity10
@entity1 has chosen not to give the name of her blue - *blooded* employer
