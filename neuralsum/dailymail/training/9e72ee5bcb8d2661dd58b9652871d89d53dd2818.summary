by @entity0 radio station @entity1 has come under fire for its lack of diversity in its announcers			1
the station tweeted ' @ @entity8 is back at # 1 ' yesterday with a photo of its presenters after @entity11 was named most popular in the latest radio ratings			1
at first , the picture which included @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 seemed harmless - until @entity18 journalist @entity17 hit out at the picture , pointing out the lack of females at the station			1
the tweet was fired off by @entity1 when its breakfast show was named most popular in ratings ' a gorgeous gathering but i ca n't quite put my finger on what 's missing			1
# oestrogen , ' she wrote , retweeting the photo			1
prominent media commentator and feminist @entity34 has backed @entity17 ' comments and said the station was n't catering for the biggest radio market			1
' i am so grateful to @entity1 for making it so clear that people like me ( aka women ) are not catered for on their station and i will therefore certainly never make the mistake of listening to them , ' the @entity38 wrote in an email to @entity46			2
' i would heartily encourage other people like me ( aka women who still make 80 % of purchases ) and advertisers interested in talking to us to take similar action and avoid @entity1 ( aka @entity53 & no women )			0
' @entity17 ' retweet has sparked a strong reaction from the online community			0
that ’s the bro - iest bro-fest i ’ve ever seen , ' @ saskystewart said			0
@ steventalevski echoed her thoughts : ' lack of diversity is a poor reflection of @entity18			2
' journalist @entity17 was n't the only one to notice , with @entity67 tweeting ' that 's the bro - iest bro-fest i 've ever seen ' @entity69 tweeted : ' lack of diversity is a poor reflection of @entity18 ' in relation to the @entity1 tweet the photo starred all white males who are part of the @entity1 team , including @entity78 president @entity14 @entity1 has since removed the photo from @entity79 but it remains on its @entity81 page since the lack of diversity was pointed out , @entity1 has removed the tweet but the offending picture still remains on @entity81 where it has also taken a beating			1
' this photo appears to have a filter on it that turns everyone into a white male , ' @entity86 wrote			2
some people have even asked why ' @entity92 ' - a female presenter at the station - did not appear in the picture			0
' @entity92 not good enough to get her mug in the pic ed ? ' @entity95 wrote			0
according to the @entity1 website , @entity92 is on air during the breakfast slot when its three male hosts are on holidays			2
' you 'll know @entity92 's laugh from @entity11 as she controls the studio that keeps @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity15 on the air , ' it read			0
@entity108 has contacted @entity1 for comment on this matter			0
people on @entity81 were asking why one of the station 's presenters by the name of @entity92 was not part of the photo			0
