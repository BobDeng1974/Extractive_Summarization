@entity0 pictured enjoying a cigarette as he walked the streets of @entity3 this week his was supposed to be the case that showed @entity5 would no longer let criminals use the @entity7 to dodge deportation			1
but this violent @entity10 burglar has still not been told to leave the country – despite judges saying he should be booted out last monday			0
the @entity13 found @entity0 – released from jail half - way through a five - year sentence for tying up and threatening to kill two women – enjoying a cigarette as he walked the streets of @entity3			1
he said he had no idea he was set to be deported under a tough new regime , despite attending two appointments with immigration officials since last monday ’s judgment			0
when told of the latest ruling , @entity0 said he had no plans to leave the new three - bedroom semi in @entity3 he shares with his @entity10 wife and their son , six , and daughter , three			1
he is now seeking legal aid for a six - figure fight to stay put – even though his father - in - law had the cash to settle a £ 200,000 debt while he was in jail			1
the greying @entity0 – who claims to be 28 – was amazed to be told he faces deportation			1
‘ every wednesday i have to report to the big immigration centre [ in @entity42 , south @entity3 ] , ’ he said			1
‘ they did n’t tell me anything about me being deported last week , or this week			2
‘ my lawyer told me it would cost £ 100,000 to appeal to the @entity48 courts			2
i ’m going to try to get legal aid			1
i ’ve got no money now			0
’ asked why he could not take his wife and children to @entity10 as judges suggested , @entity0 said : ‘ my children are @entity5 citizens			1
in @entity10 , i did n’t have a house or anything , and everything has changed since i was there			0
what job could i do there ? ‘ here , i can work in a kitchen , be a driver ... anything is easy because i ’ve lived here for a long time			0
’ @entity0 was not keen to dwell on the two counts of robbery he pleaded guilty to in 2010			1
he entered the home of two sleeping women in the middle of the night , tied them up and terrorised them into telling him their pins – but after one victim escaped her restraints and called the police , officers caught @entity0 hiding in the toilet			1
claiming he made ‘ about £ 200 ’ in the robbery , @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t understand the law here			2
i do something wrong – i ’m guilty , i go to jail			0
‘ i owed somebody money , and they said they wanted to kill me , so i made a mistake			0
they [ his victims ] left the door open , that ’s how i got in			0
but i ’ve done my sentence			0
since then i ’ve done nothing wrong			0
’ originally from the bustling province of @entity87 on the south - eastern coast of @entity10 , @entity0 came to @entity89 in 2002 when he claimed to be 16 – but social services decided he was at least two years older			2
denied asylum in august of that year , he stayed on illegally			0
his wife , who came to @entity5 as an accountancy student in 2001 , had their son in 2007 , and @entity0 was duly granted ‘ indefinite leave to remain ’			2
it was home secretary @entity98 who said when @entity0 was jailed in 2010 that he would have to be deported upon release			2
yet when that time came – just halfway through his sentence – @entity0 battled to stay , invoking the @entity7 ’s ‘ right to a family life ’			1
a first hearing by immigration judges ruled in his favour – but two years later , the @entity104 said he should be kicked out after the home secretary changed the law to force judges to only consider the right to a family life in ‘ exceptional cases ’			0

’ her new laws have slashed the number of grounds on which foreign criminals can challenge rulings from 17 to four , as well as banning them from continually bringing up ‘ new evidence ’ to keep their cases dragging on			0
a @entity137 spokesman said last night that @entity0 was free on immigration bail pending any appeal he may make against deportation			1
a government source added : ‘ @entity0 is not on a fast plane to @entity10 because he ’s still got several appeal routes – and it ’s difficult to say how long he ’s got to try them			2
’ the @entity146 warned last week that each foreign criminal costs the taxpayer an average of £ 70,000 a year , adding up to a total bill of about £ 1billion a year .			0
