by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 21 september 2012 police probing the photographer who took the topless pictures of the @entity4 are now questioning staff at the @entity7 chateau where the couple were staying			1
in the latest development of the scandal , detectives want to know how the photographer knew exactly where to take the intrusive photos amid suspicions it was an ' inside job '			1
the news comes after @entity7 paparazzo @entity18 said it was an @entity20 living in the south of @entity22 that staked out the royal couple at the chateau while on their holiday			1
and @entity29 celebrity magazine @entity27 has become the fifth publication to print photographs of @entity4 sunbathing topless as the images have now been seen by millions worldwide			1
police will now search the place where the pictures were taken more than half a mile from the retreat			2
it is thought they will also look for clues or dna traces left behind			0
a source told @entity71 newspaper : ' officially the crime scene is the chateau and its environs			1
' this will be visited by detectives who will then have to work out how the photographer came to be there - who alerted him to the presence of the royal couple and where he took the pictures from			2
' this kind of investigation involves interviewing as many potential witnesses as possible			0
' a spokesman for @entity88 said any investigation at the chateau was a matter for the @entity7 authorities			2
denial : if true , the claim would exonerate @entity7 photographer @entity95 , who claims she took bikini photos of @entity4 but not topless ones yesterday mr @entity18 , a close friend of former @entity7 first lady @entity97 and one of @entity22 's most notorious long lens photographers , revealed the photographer who took topless pictures of @entity4 was @entity102			1
he also sensationally claimed that the photographer was spying on them on the orders of @entity22 's @entity106 , which was first to publish 13 intimate images of @entity4 and @entity51 last week			1
he told @entity109 newspaper in @entity110 : ' the irony of this whole thing is that the photographer who took these pictures is an @entity20 living in the south of @entity22			1
' these photos were taken on the orders of @entity106 , who asked him to sit around for several days to take them			0
' for his efforts he did not earn a lot			0
he could have sold them for 10,000 euros			0
' but in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them			0
' he did n't put them on the open market either , where he could have earned a lot more			0
' mr @entity18 did not specifically say he knew the identity of @entity4 's photographer , but is known to be very well connected among the @entity7 paparazzi community			2
he defended the person who took them , adding : ' as a photographer , i take the pictures i want and let the publication decide whether to print them			1
' what they choose to print is not the photographer 's problem , but the editor 's			2
' originally it was believed the intimate photographs may have been taken by a @entity7 photographer named @entity95 - nicknamed the sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname			1
she has admitted taking pictures of @entity4 in her bikini , but said she does not know who took the topless photos			2
the @entity158 couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by @entity106 , under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine			0
they have also handed over all files containing the images to representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge , after they were ruled a ' brutal ' invasion of privacy			0
the court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer , however , and it has the right to protect his or identity under @entity22 's laws on protection of journalistic sources			1
@entity182 marks the spot : the long lens pictures taken of the topless @entity185 were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau but the ruling has not prevented the publication of the photos elsewhere			1
@entity29 magazine @entity27 ( see and hear ) became the fifth publication to print the photographs of the @entity4 sunbathing topless yesteday			1
the magazine 's 16 - page spread included 14 topless shots of @entity4 and three where she is changing her bikini bottoms yet the photos are still being touted on the open market worldwide , with magazines in @entity202 , @entity29 and @entity43 all publishing them			1
@entity204 said ' proportionate responses were under review '			0
the @entity43 magazine which published the pictures on wednesday , @entity209 and its @entity29 counterpart are owned by the @entity29 - based @entity212 company			1
@entity213 , editor - in - chief of the @entity29 magazine , said he was ' incredibly proud ' to have obtained the sole @entity29 rights to the photographs			1
closer published 13 grainy images of @entity4 's breasts and bottom last thursday , branded ' grotesque and unjustifiable ' by a @entity158 spokesman			2
@entity202 magazine @entity220 also published the pictures , while @entity222 , editor of the @entity223 , was suspended after publishing a selection that he called ' tasteful ' @entity202 magazine @entity220 also published the photos in a 26 - page special edition			1
@entity220 's editor @entity227 said on the matter : ' the fact that these are the future rulers of @entity20 makes the article more interesting and topical			2
' this is a deserving topic because it shows in a completely natural way the daily life of a very famous , young and modern couple in love , ' he said			0
there are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of @entity4 and @entity51 at the time - many of them much more revealing			0
closer magazine 's editor @entity242 defended her decision to publish 13 of the photos , insisting the images were ' joyous '			1
she said : ' these photos are not in the least shocking			0
they show a young woman sunbathing topless , like millions of women you see on beaches			0
' they were not making any special effort to conceal themselves			0
critcising our magazine is stupid			0
' ms @entity258 also warned also that @entity106 had more photos , adding : ' intimate pictures exist that we have n't published and will not publish			2
probably other newspapers will choose to publish them			0
' video : editor - in - chief calls @entity4 pic ' nothing spectacular '			0

police ' treating chateau and surroundings as crime scene '
photographer who took topless pictures was @entity20 living in @entity22
@entity7 closer magazine has caused a storm by publishing intimate images
@entity282 has banned anyone in @entity22 from republishing intrusive photos
