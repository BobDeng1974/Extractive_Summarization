@entity0 , who was not expected to to walk after suffering brain damage at birth , has defied medics and taken his first steps after copying his favourite pirate programme a toddler who suffered brain damage at birth has defied medics and learned to walk by copying pirates on his favourite tv show			1
@entity0 suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was starved of oxygen during his planned home birth at the family home in @entity15 , @entity16 , in april 2012			1
he was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to get him breathing before he was put on a special temperature mat for three days to cool his body down			0
doctors told his parents @entity24 , 33 , and @entity25 , 32 , their son was likely to be disabled and would never walk , talk or feed himself			1
but after spending most of his first year in hospital for a series of operations and rehabilitation therapy , @entity0 defied medics by learning to speak aged 20 months			1
and the remarkable toddler then stunned his parents when he achieved another milestone and walked for the first time on his second birthday			1
today , his proud parents recalled the moment he took his first wobbly steps after copying pirates walking the plank on his favourite @entity43 show @entity44			1
mr @entity0 , who runs a software business , said : ‘ he was at home against the sofa while his favourite programme @entity44 was on			1
‘ he loves @entity44 and gets all excited about it			2
his favourite bit is joining in with the singing and dancing bit			0
‘ he was standing against the sofa and copying them saying “ walk the plank , walk the plank ”			2
‘ at first he was throwing himself to the floor but he just started to take some steps			0
‘ we were amazed and after a few minutes he was walking halfway across the room			0
‘ before he could stand and balance and walk using his baby - walker or holding our hands but it ’s like the show just gave him the confidence to try it on his own			2
‘ we were all crying because we were so happy , so proud			0
he ’d only just learned to crawl three weeks before			0
’ @entity0 , pictured having treatment at @entity69 , was starved of oxygen during his birth and his parents were warned he would never walk or talk @entity0 was born at home and had to be rushed to hospital where he spent time in intensive care ( pictured ) full - time mother , mrs @entity76 , who used to work as a project manager in the charity sector before becoming @entity0 ’s carer , added : ‘ it was just amazing , we just could n’t believe it			1
‘ he was on his own and all of a sudden he just started walking			0
it was such an incredible moment			0
’ @entity0 's parents , who have another son , @entity84 , five , are amazed by his achievements and hope he will soon no longer need the feeding tube he currently has			1
they also want doctors to be more positive when informing families about their child ’s possible recovery from a brain injury			2
his mother added : ‘ he was born at home and was oxygen deprived so he was taken to @entity96 then @entity97 for brain cooling			2
‘ he had quite a bleak prognosis and we were told it was likely he ’d be disabled			0
we did n’t think he ’d walk , talk or feed without a feeding tube			2
@entity0 ( pictured with parents @entity103 and @entity24 ) defied doctors to walk despite suffering brain damage ‘ it was devastating and it ’s been difficult with him being in and out of hospital			1
but he ’s gone on to do so well			0
‘ the doctors told us the worst case because it was a severe case			0
but we think they should be more honest and said it ’s very unpredictable with babies			0
‘ some children with a brain injury make a really good recovery like @entity0 has so they should let people know that is a possibility too			1
’ incredibly , just a week after he learnt to walk , @entity0 dressed up as @entity120 and joined his friends on the ‘ @entity122 ’ at @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity16			1
the family originally planned to raise £ 100 for @entity126 ’s but managed to gather almost £ 1,000 - the most single - handedly raised for the national event .			0
