@entity9 deputy governor @entity0 said last night that more could be done to punish traders following ‘ a series of appalling cases of misconduct ’ over recent years			2
the 52 - year - old highlighted ‘ truly shocking evidence ’ of traders manipulating the prices of everything from gold and oil to lead and coffee , as well as fixing interest rates and currencies			1
‘ i find this behaviour outrageous , ’ she said in her first speech since being brought in by governor @entity23 to root out wrongdoing and restore trust in financial markets			2
speaking at the @entity29 last night , dr @entity0 said : ‘ the initial argument that it is just the case of a few bad apples is no longer credible			1
it seems there were deep - rooted problems			2
’ dr @entity0 , who studied at the @entity29 and @entity34 and was permanent secretary at the @entity36 for three years before joining the @entity37 , is now leading a review into the @entity39 , @entity40 and commodity markets ( @entity42 )			1
she said : ‘ it is clear that , in the run - up to the crisis , some firms in @entity42 markets had allowed the culture on their trading floors to get out of control			2
’ @entity51 - born dr @entity0 said she was particularly struck at the ‘ casual ’ attitude of traders involved in the scandals , and that the review she is heading to tackle their ‘ anything goes ’ attitude should think about imposing harsher punishments			1
‘ the review wants to consider whether more needs to be done to punish misconduct , ’ she said			0
she highlighted the case of one @entity62 trader who sent a message to his manager about a request to manipulate @entity67 interest rates – used to set savings and borrowing rates throughout the economy			0

dr @entity0 , who is known by her nickname @entity95 and is arguably the most powerful woman in the @entity5 , said progress has been made to clean up the financial markets , including a clampdown on bumper bonuses , however , she added : ‘ the risk is that , as memories of recent enforcement cases fade , bad practices may re-emerge			1
some say that may already be happening			0
’ although the string of financial scandals has cast a shadow over the lenders , not a single senior banker has been jailed			0
