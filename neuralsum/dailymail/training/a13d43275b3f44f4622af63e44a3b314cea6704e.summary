by @entity0 published : 20:11 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 20:12 est , 26 december 2012 the @entity2 case was engulfed in a secrecy row last night after court officials refused to reveal how much legal aid his killers claimed			1
@entity2 , 37 , and @entity2 , 36 , are believed to have spent up to £ 1million of public money on defence costs before and during their murder trial			1
but the @entity11 has blocked a request for information about how much taxpayers ’ money they used			1
it argues that publication of the amount could ‘ compromise the litigation ’ – meaning the pair would be unable to receive a fair trial in the unlikely event that an appeal results in a retrial			2
guilty of murder : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) are believed to have spent up to £ 1million of public money on defence costs this is despite the fact the men have already been convicted of the teenager ’s murder – more than a decade after both @entity2 and @entity2 were among five men named by the @entity34 in 1997 as @entity0 ’s killers			1
critics say the ruling is further evidence of @entity40 ’s secrecy culture , following controversy over secret courts and inquests , restricted access to family courts and the police clamp - down on how much information they release in the @entity50 era			0
after a six - week trial , an @entity52 jury ruled in january that @entity2 and @entity2 were guilty of the race - hate murder of @entity2 , 18 , in @entity56 , south - east @entity57 in april 1993 after a six - week trial , an @entity52 jury ruled in january that @entity2 and @entity2 were guilty of the race - hate murder of @entity0 , 18 , in @entity56 , south - east @entity57 in april 1993			1
they were jailed for life			0
the pair immediately appealed against their convictions , saying the trial had been unfair			0
but in august their written applications were thrown out by a single @entity71 judge , who ruled there were no grounds to grant them leave to appeal			0
@entity2 and @entity2 , part of a gang of five racists who stabbed @entity0 to death , have since launched a new appeal against their convictions			2
a decision on whether they will be granted leave to appeal is not expected for several @entity83 this , the @entity34 last month submitted a @entity86 request to the @entity11 , asking for details of the amount of legal aid claimed by @entity2 and @entity2 at their murder trial			1
both men had large legal teams , led by experienced qcs			0
before the trial , @entity2 – who was prosecuted under new double jeopardy laws – tried to get the charge thrown out at a hearing at the @entity99			2
after considering the @entity34 ’s @entity86 request for three weeks , a spokesman for the @entity11 said : ‘ since receiving your request , it has been confirmed to the @entity11 that both @entity2 and @entity2 have renewed their application for leave to appeal to the @entity108 against their convictions			1
‘ as this case remains on - going it is considered that the disclosure of the costs associated with the case to date would be likely to compromise the litigation , if the appeal resulted in a retrial before a jury			0
the mail on january 4 , 2012 - the day after the killers were jailed this is because it could influence the decision of a jury given the high - profile nature of the case and the press attention it has generated , thus potentially prejudicing the outcome of the case			2
’ officials are to carry out an internal review of the decision after the @entity34 appealed against the @entity11 ’s ruling			2
in a letter of complaint , solicitors @entity134 pointed out that no new trial is pending for @entity2 and @entity2			0
it said : ‘ legal aid is funded by the @entity40 taxpayer			0
there is a clear public interest in the disclosure of information pertaining to how much legal aid was awarded to convicted criminals which far outweighs the hypothetical and remote chance of prejudice you have identified			0
’ in january , @entity2 was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months , while @entity2 was given a minimum of 14 years and three months .			1

murderers @entity2 , 37 , and @entity2 , 36 , are believed to have spent the sum on defence costs
but @entity11 has blocked a request for information about exactly how much taxpayers ’ money they used
the pair were found guilty of the 1993 murder of @entity2 in january 2012
