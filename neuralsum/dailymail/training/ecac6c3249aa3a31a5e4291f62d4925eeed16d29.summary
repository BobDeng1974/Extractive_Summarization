by @entity0 my knees ache , my legs are in a tangle , and every inch of my untoned body feels as if it has been put through a vigorous exercise routine			2
i am a shadow of my usual self — which for the past hour is literally what i have been			2
i have been practising with the shadow dancers from @entity13 , the troupe whose stunningly clever silhouettes have made them the bookies ’ favourite at odds of 11/10 to win this year ’s @entity19 ’s @entity18			1
thirteen million viewers watched them storm through their audition on the first night of the current series and many were left , like @entity24 , in tears at their poignant act			1
but the tale turned darker than its shadows when the soldier husband is killed in @entity44 and the dancers turned themselves into a camel , palm trees , an enemy sniper and , finally , a cemetery			2
it ’s all down to firmly shaped bodies and exact positioning , explains @entity13 ’s founder and choreographer @entity53			1
he uses a simple back light to project shadows of the dancers ’ bodies on to the screen to form seemingly impossible images and scenery in an emotional storyboard set to music			1
the performance stunned the judges and brought the panel and entire theatre audience to its feet			2
in the past month , @entity13 ’s audition has captured a further 17 million hits on @entity71			1
which is why i find myself firmly contained in an unforgiving @entity75 unitard , nervously waiting to rehearse with the now world - famous @entity77 troupe who have flown into @entity32 early so i can join them for a practice session before their appearance in this week ’s live semi-finals , and see exactly how it ’s done			1
‘ a mere millimetre out of place can change an entire shape			0
it ’s all down to the distance between the light and the screen , which can shrink or magnify a body , ’ says @entity53			1
about 13million people tuned to watch them in their first audition on @entity19 's @entity18 i soon discover what he means as i watch the team re-enact the story that has captured the nation			1
then i am asked to recreate the scenes taking the part of the young wife and mother who is widowed after her husband flies to @entity44			0
we start at @entity106 — created by three rows of dancers — and i am linked with dancer @entity109 to create the shadow of the couple holding hands			1
my arms have to remain still and twisted otherwise they create a grotesque @entity115 image , with me as the @entity115			1
creating the shadow is all about precision and aligning with the beam of light from the projector , which is important when i portray the bride in the @entity32 taxi scene , passing the @entity123 and the @entity124			0
i have to kneel while stretching and straining both forwards and upwards to have any hope of getting my shadow anywhere near that of my taller bridegroom @entity109			0
but although my knees are feeling the pain , i have to keep still and smile to create the harmony between music , visual performance and body control			1
‘ i choose the song first and after i create the dance , ’ says @entity53			1
in this case the song chosen is @entity142 ’s @entity141 and before i know it it ’s time for me to start a family , and i am gently handed a doll while other dancers twist themselves to create the image of a pram standing in front of @entity151			1
creating the shadow , seen here on the show , is all about precision and aligning the beam of light ‘ this is @entity159 , ’ says @entity53			0
look and smile at him and hold him like a real baby , supporting his neck			0
’ rocking @entity159 up and down , while tucking in his toes to keep the line of the shadow smooth , lifting his hand with my fingers and smiling at him to show real emotion is hard when all i can think is one false move against the projector will make me look like a still - expectant mother			0
@entity159 and i are the only ones allowed to sport free - flowing hair , while the other dancers must wear swimming caps to keep their shadow lines smooth			0
as i look down there is one dancer on the floor below me who is creating the pram hood shadow , curving her arm around her head while balancing on the backs of two men who form the wheels			0
my strength is failing as i wobble while trying to balance @entity159 and hold the position			0
my husband leaves for @entity44 , and i go from dutiful wife and mother to acting out the local scenery			0
@entity53 bends me into the palm tree position , angling my arms to create the arched branch			1
and with one twist of the head , my arm is magnified from a branch to a chunky tree trunk , while my fingers morph from delicate palm leaf fronds to fat lily pads			0
there is laughter from the camel and from the other dancers viewing the shadow in front of the screen			0
@entity53 bends me back into shape , lifting my arm high to resemble a spout while pushing my nose into my armpit			0
all the shapes such as this palm tree and camel are creating by contorting the bodies of the dancers holding the pose is agony and i can feel my head slowly drooping towards the floor			1
‘ keep your head up — it is supposed to represent a coconut , ’ says @entity53			0
no body part can be allowed to stray , otherwise the entire shadow collapses			0
this is why the eight dancers have to train 11 hours nearly every day , perfecting their flexibility as well as concentration			0
‘ this is very hard work — you need physical and mental stamina and that ’s why we practice long hours to achieve it , ’ warns @entity53			1
‘ accidents can easily happen when we ’re standing on each others ’ backs			0
we have daily physiotherapy and sports massages to prevent injuries			0
’ shadow dancing has its origins in @entity245 , some 300 years ago			0
@entity53 , 40 , an award - winning breakdancer , founded attraction in 2004 as part of @entity77 ’s @entity250			1
he runs it with his wife @entity252 , who is the troupe ’s manager — as well as mother to the couple ’s two sons			1
the key to keeping the shapes is down to team work , says @entity252 , 39			2
‘ we tell our dancers there is no room for ego because the connection to others is vital			0
this group has been together for three years			0
but if we bring in someone new , everyone has to decide if they fit in			0
if not , they ’re told to go			0
’ attraction tackle poignant subject matter in their shadow act @entity252 , whose sons are aged ten and seven , takes care of all the dancers ’ needs			1
‘ this is our second family			0
i am like a mother to the dancers who are mostly in their teens and early 20s			0
’ they had taken part in the @entity77 and @entity283 shows based on @entity19 ’s @entity18 doing their normal @entity250 act — where the illusions required a completely dark theatre , ultraviolet lighting and fluorescent costumes			1
at one moment , performers were invisible ; in the next , they appeared to be floating in the air — but made little impact			0
so @entity53 changed tack with shadow dancing , debuting as guest performers on @entity77 ’s @entity297 in 2008			2
when they learned @entity19 ’s @entity18 was open to @entity299 acts they sent a video of their performance to the show ’s producers and were invited to audition in @entity304			1
it proved to be the international breakthrough they were waiting for — and the troupe are determined to capitalise on it			2
in their rehearsal studio , @entity13 usually create their shadows with just one lamp and no projector			2
@entity53 says : ‘ it keeps costs down , but for @entity19 ’s @entity18 we have rented a projector			1
every time we use a projector , we have to customise all the shapes and distances as each one creates a different effect			2
so we have to spend time working out the perfect position to ensure it throws all the shadows precisely			0
’ when the troupe learned the show was open to @entity299 acts they sent an audition tape to the @entity19 thousands of tiny fluorescent stickers are dotted over the soft dance mat , each colour representing the foot and hand positioning for each shadow for every dancer			1
although all the performers are a mix of ballet , modern , hip - hop and street dancers , @entity53 says the moves are easy for the troupe to master			2
‘ the real work is having the core strength to hold the shapes and also to work with the projector with precision , ’ he says			2
the hardest shadow for the troupe is their ‘ big face ’			2
everyone is needed for this shape but i am spared the indignity of piggybacking and bending into someone ’s bottom to create a chin			1
instead , i wiggle my fingers to create fluttering eyelashes			2
@entity53 says : ‘ we can create bigger shapes with more people but we are only eight and have no reserves , so we have to be very careful no one gets injured , because having got this far on @entity19 ’s @entity18 , it would be a huge disappointment if our performance was spoiled			1
’ there have been complaints on @entity372 that @entity299 artists are being allowed to compete in a @entity19 show			1
but they have @entity377 ’s support			2
he says : ‘ we are part of @entity299 ; it ’s flattering they fly all this way to enter the show			2
it means our brits have got to step up			0
’ attraction ’s ultimate dream is to win and perform for @entity386			1
‘ we hope we are popular and would like to go through to the final as we want to thank the @entity19 people			1
but we are also realistic			0
the most important thing to us is that we feel we ’ve already won because @entity19 ’s @entity18 has put attraction on the worldwide map , ’ says @entity252 .			1
