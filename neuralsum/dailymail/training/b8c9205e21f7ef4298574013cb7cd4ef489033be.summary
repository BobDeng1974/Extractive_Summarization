members of @entity3 's @entity2 minority have been accused of carrying out revenge attacks on @entity6 villagers they believe helped @entity8 commit atrocities on their community last year			1
arabs living in @entity12 in @entity3 's @entity14 province say groups of heavily armed @entity2 have made four raids on the villages over the past two weeks , leaving 21 people dead and a further 17 missing			1
yazidis , whose ancient religion has elements of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , suffered grievously after @entity27 ' rapid offensive last year			1
hundreds were killed and thousands captured , enslaved and raped by the @entity6 militants , who consider @entity2 devil worshippers			1
the rest , including these children , have had to relocate to one of the increasing number of camps for internally displaced people in @entity3 yazidis returning to their homes in @entity12 are uncovering one mass grave after another in the area - evidence of @entity27 rule there from last august until its fighters were driven out late last year			1
now some @entity2 are striking back			1
more than a dozen @entity58 residents have told journalists that armed groups of @entity2 raided four of their villages in @entity12 two weeks ago , killing at least 21 people			1
a further 17 went missing			2
' it was an act of revenge by the @entity2 , ' said 41 - year - old @entity65 from @entity66 , one of the affected villages			1
' the aim is to expel @entity70 from the area so that only @entity2 remain : they want to change the map			2
' the identity of the @entity2 assailants is unclear because there are several competing forces fighting @entity27 in @entity12 , with them all blaming each other for the raids			1
. but what is certain is that the reprisals expose how @entity27 ; incursion created divisions between communities that had coexisted for decades , turning one village against another and making enemies of former friends			2
they also show the risk of similar violence when other groups displaced by @entity27 , such as @entity92 and @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , are able to return home			2
base : members of the minority @entity2 sect are seen at one of their temporary camps on @entity12 a displaced girl from the @entity2 community is seen at @entity105 for internally displaced people in @entity3 amid @entity27 ' brutal rape and slaughter of the @entity2 , those who could fled in the summer heat in an exodus that prompted @entity112 - led airstrikes against the jihadists in both @entity3 and @entity114			1
over the past week , the remains of more than 40 @entity2 who had been unable to leave before the arrival of @entity27 were discovered in two bloodstained pits in northwest @entity3			1
residents of @entity66 , now staying in another village about 28 miles away , say they helped @entity2 escape in august and stashed away their belongings for safekeeping , even though the jihadis punished those who were found doing so			1
but @entity2 from the nearby @entity123 settlement say @entity70 in the surrounding villages sided with @entity27 looting their possessions and actively participating in what they call attempted genocide			1
@entity6 residents admitted several men from @entity130 had joined the militants but said they were killed or fled to @entity114 when @entity133 peshmerga forces drove @entity8 from the area in december			0
after regaining control , the peshmerga confiscated weapons from @entity70 villagers , who began to receive threats from @entity2 , culminating in the attack on @entity130 and @entity142 on january 25			2
the following day , @entity2 gunmen plundered and torched the nearby @entity70 villages of @entity145 and @entity146 , whose residents had already fled			1
@entity148 intervened to prevent further attacks			0
members of the @entity2 minority search for clues that might lead them to missing relatives in the remains of people killed by @entity27 a day after @entity133 forces discovered a mass grave near the @entity3 village of @entity160 @entity162 task : @entity133 forces found the remains of about 25 men , women and children of the @entity2 minority killed by the @entity8 in the grave while searching for explosives left behind by the terror group most of @entity130 's 1,000 residents were sleeping when gunshots signalled the arrival of a military convoy flying the @entity133 flag			1
at first , they thought peshmerga or @entity133 secret police known as @entity179 , both of which recruit local @entity2 , were conducting a routine inspection			2
two yazidis , one in military uniform , came to 31 - year old @entity186 's house and ordered him to hand over his car keys and identification			0
' who does that belong to ? ' asked the one in uniform , pointing at an electricity generator , which @entity186 explained had been entrusted to him by a @entity2 friend			2
' you are all @entity8 , ' said the other , loading the generator into @entity186 's car and driving off with it			0
dozens of civilian cars began to arrive from the direction of @entity203 and men , whom the @entity70 villagers identified as local @entity2 helped themselves to household appliances , vehicles and livestock			1
women said the assailants , dressed in military and civilian clothing , pulled rings off their fingers and stole valuables from their pockets			0
many people fled , some hiding in a nearby valley			0
those who stayed said they saw the men spread out through @entity130 and pour petrol from jerry cans before setting fire to the village , incinerating several elderly people in their homes			2
horror : over the past week , the remains of more than 40 @entity2 who had been unable to leave before the arrival of @entity27 were discovered in two bloodstained pits in northwest @entity3 searching for answers they do n't want to find : members of the @entity2 sect sift through the skeletal remains a skull is seen resting on the ground a day after at a mass grave containing the remains of members of the @entity2 community killed by @entity27 is uncovered @entity239 , a 35 - year - old shepherd with mental disabilities , was tending his flock on the outskirts of @entity66 when a car sped up to him			1
his elder brother , @entity244 , watched from a distance as a man got out of the vehicle and shot @entity239 before making off with his sheep			0
@entity244 later took @entity239 to hospital in the @entity133 city of @entity251 , where he lay last week with a bullet wound to his right side			0
on the same ward were six other villagers wounded in the attack , including 11 - year - old @entity257 , who had been shot twice			0
' it was like @entity261 had arrived , ' @entity257 's father said			0
as @entity130 burned , the gunmen moved on to @entity142 , 2 km to the south , where 60 - year - old @entity264 watched smoke rising from the neighbouring village			0
one of the militants thrust a machine gun barrel in @entity264 's chest and ordered him out			0
' where should i go ? ' @entity271 recalled asking			0
' go to hell ! ' was the reply			0
' we are the @entity2 state ! ' @entity271 said he had been spared because one of the assailants knew him personally and allowed him to escape			2
@entity280 was less fortunate : he was shot dead in front of his wife			0
' i saw it with my own eyes , ' she said			0
once night fell and the gunmen withdrew , residents of both villages returned to retrieve the dead , protected by peshmerga			0
of the 10 corpses recovered from @entity130 , three were old women , residents told @entity294			0
four bodies had been burned , one belonging to a community elder bound to a chair			0
eleven corpses were found in @entity299			0
a member of the @entity2 minority searches in a wallet for clues to the identity of the victims @entity27 spearheaded a june offensive that began in the northern province of @entity14 , where this mass grave was discovered , and overran large areas north and west of the @entity3 capital slaughtered : @entity27 carried out a campaign of killings , kidnappings and enslavement against @entity315 living in the area that the @entity317 termed an ' attempt to commit genocide ' the villagers accused prominent @entity2 fighter @entity321 of involvement in the attacks			1
@entity321 , who is close to the dominant @entity324 , confirmed he had been in @entity66 and @entity142 that day , but denied his men were responsible			0
' our traditions do not allow for that kind of behaviour , ' he said , blaming ' extremists ' serving a foreign agenda - a reference to the rival @entity333 and its @entity114 affiliate , which are fighting in @entity12 and have formed a @entity2 militia there			1
the @entity333 says it had nothing to do with it			0
@entity2 civilians took up arms alongside them during a months - long siege of @entity12 by @entity27 last year			1
@entity133 peshmerga and @entity179 officers are also present in the area			0
arabs and @entity2 agree @entity346 will never be the same as it was before @entity8 came , when they were friends and farmed together			1
many @entity2 no longer trust the peshmerga to defend them , while the newly displaced @entity70 , all from the @entity350 tribe , said they would return to their villages only if @entity133 forces physically separated them			1
since the attack on @entity142 and @entity130 , two @entity2 have been killed in @entity12 , in what some believe was an @entity70 reprisal			1
others said it was an internal @entity2 feud			2
' for every action there is a reaction , ' said an @entity70 man from @entity12			2
' this is not over ' .			0
