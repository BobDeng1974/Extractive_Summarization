this is the hilarious moment a police car joined in with @entity3 festivities by ' knocking down ' a group of partygoers who were dressed as bowling pins			1
the footage , which has been viewed millions of times around the world , shows the 11 men - each dressed in a £ 30 red and white skittle costume – approaching the marked police car making ghost noises			1
assembling in front of the vehicle , the police driver appears to realise the group 's intentions and , in good spirits , slowly drives into the ' laid out pins ' and bowls them over			1

most of the bars were happy with us going in and wanted us to get involved			0
