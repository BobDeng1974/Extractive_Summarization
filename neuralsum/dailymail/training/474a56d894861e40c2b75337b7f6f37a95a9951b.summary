by @entity1 reporter published : 13:18 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 25 june 2013 scientists are still reviewing their findings but one thing is clear : there was a tsunami wave in @entity7 on june 13			1
an unlikely occurrence on the country ’s east coast , the wave was observed by several people at @entity13 in @entity14			1
and three men were even sucked into the water			1
the storm , a much stronger version of which took out power and caused destruction over a swath of the @entity35 and @entity36 last summer , had come to an end before the waves were detected by more than 30 tide gauges in the northwest @entity40			1
at around 3:30pm , @entity41 was spearfishing near @entity42			2
the sky was grey , but the weather had calmed and the tide was on its way out			2
@entity41 said that ’s when the water began to rush out of the inlet unusually fast			1
rocks that what been submerged were suddenly revealed in the over one minute gush			0
rare : quite unusual for the @entity36 , the 6 - foot gush occurred at this @entity23 inlet at @entity13 @entity56 : @entity58 scientists say the culprit , at least partially , could be the low - end derecho that swept across the eastern half of the country june 13 wall of water : @entity41 was spear fishing when he first saw water gush out of the inlet and then surge back in and described a ' wall of water ' with six - foot waves meanwhile , @entity41 ’s friends , who were diving below him , ‘ drifted literally like a hundred yards in like 30 seconds ’ he told @entity71			1
@entity41 then saw a 6 - foot wave replace the receding waters , despite the outgoing tide			1
‘ there was whitewater across the whole mouth of the inlet , ’ he said			0
three people were swept off the rocks of the nearby jetty by the wave and two required subsequent medical attention			1
weather induced ? a satellite image shows the derecho as it approached the east coast june 13			1
researchers called the causes of the wave ¿ complex ¿ and ¿ still under review ¿ ‘ it had a different kind of energy , ’ @entity41 said			0
‘ more like a surge than an actual wave			0
’ @entity99 , steward at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , said he saw a strong current of about 7 knots , or 8 miles per hour , going out through a channel into @entity106			0
normally , he said , the current is 1 to 2 miles per hour			0
the current was so strong that one large boat pulled its cleat out of the dock , he said			0
after a while , the current reversed at the same speed , he said			0
a nearby gauge recorded that the sea level changed by 1.3 feet			0
various factors are being analyzed , including the possibility that slumping at the @entity118 of @entity7 played a role			1
‘ from @entity124 up through @entity123 , we can find that signal , even though it 's very small , which tells us there was something going on , ’ @entity120 , head of @entity58 's tsunami program , said tuesday			2
‘ we 're trying to piece this back together			0
’ dangerous : three men were swept from this @entity7 jetty by the 6 - foot surge and two required medical attention @entity120 stopped short of saying it was a tsunami , but acknowledged it had specific characteristics of one			1
@entity58 's @entity139 / @entity138 posted a statement calling it a tsunami			2
@entity120 said it is a specific feature of tsunamis for water to be drawn out to sea and then rapidly rush back in , and the water speeds @entity99 reported in @entity102 indicated something other than a storm surge			2
he said researchers are looking for a cause			0
one possibility is a rare meteotsunami , which is a tsunami caused by weather			1
or it could have been caused by a landslide off the continental shelf , which is less rare but still uncommon , he said			2
' if we ca n't do that , it 's going to be tough to put this egg back together , ' he said .			0

a 6 - foot swell swept three people into the water in rare @entity36 occurrence
a tsunami last hit @entity7 in 1931
scientists believe the june 13 derecho may have been to blame
