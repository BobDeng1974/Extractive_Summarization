by @entity0 radio presenter @entity0 said our terrible attitude towards littering makes many parks look like rubbish dumps not so long ago , i was taking a walk in @entity8 with my dog @entity10 , when an expensive 4x4 swept towards me out of a garage forecourt			1
@entity13 was a woman , with her two children sitting in the back in impeccable school uniforms			1
as she pulled alongside me , to my astonishment she casually chucked two plastic shopping bags out the window			1
before she could pull into the road , i asked her somewhat forcibly what kind of example she thought she was setting for her children			1
without even deigning to look me in the eye , she pretended she had n’t heard me			1
then , eyes front and nose in the air , she drove her gas - guzzling monster away , leaving the plastic bags to dance in the air in her slipstream			1
though i do n’t supposed she cared in the least , it will take those bags centuries to rot away			1
that depressing incident hammered home the fact that litter louts can be found across the social spectrum , as you ’ll discover whether you pay a visit to a greyhound racing track or the @entity43 or even the @entity44 : at the end of the day , the rubbish that ’s chucked on the ground is appalling			1
we have a terrible attitude to dropping litter in this country — which is why some of our parks and commons look like rubbish dumps , with the occasional patch of green showing through			1
at this time of year especially when the sun is shining and people congregate outdoors , it ’s shocking			2
before you dismiss me as a boring old @entity63 type , i ’m the first to admit i ’m not some paragon of civic rectitude by any means			2
neither am i a caped crusader with a black bin bag on a personal mission to keep @entity71			2
in all honesty , i am actually a bit of an idiot			2
in fact , the one time i really lost my temper with a group of litter bugs , i came to regret it for a very long time			1
the flashpoint came about one day when i was out with @entity10 for a walk , this time on @entity83			2
while @entity10 pottered about as dogs do , my gaze settled on a group of about six youths ranging from around 12 to 14 years old , who were kicking around a couple of bags of rubbish someone had placed beside an overflowing bin			1
it really was disgusting – their behaviour and the contents of the bags			2
‘ guys , ’ i said in what i hoped was a kind of paternal way			2
‘ please do n’t do that			2
’ what a ridiculous thing to say			2
@entity104 in @entity8 , where the presenter was spat on and subjected to a barrage of abuse perhaps unsurprisingly , they were deaf to my lame protestations			1
the first volley of abuse was verbal			2
shall we call it ‘ the language of the newsroom ’ ( and then some ) ? as f - words rained down on me , i felt the anger welling up inside me , and an overwhelming desire to stand up to these little yobs			2
still clinging to the dog lead , i got down on my haunches and started picking the litter up , attempting to put it back in the bag			1
then came the second — far more disgusting — fusillade			0
my first thought was : ‘ is it raining ? ’ it was , in fact , a monsoon of spittle accompanied by a soundtrack of guttural retching			0
i was covered in the stuff			0
i have to tell you , it was bloody awful			0
down my neck , even on my face			0
can you imagine anything more repulsive ? as the lads decided to leg it , i turned for home and , though it pains me to admit it — i was actually crying			0
is n’t that pathetic ? when i got to my safe haven , which was about ten minutes away , i let @entity10 in and went straight upstairs and pulled my spittle - flecked clothes off			0
when i came out the shower , i called my wife @entity152 and told her what had happened			0
she was more than furious , just incandescent with anger			0
but not with the louts who ’d done this to me			1
no , with her husband			0
she gave me the second sweary salvo i ’d received that evening — albeit in a somewhat more genteel way — telling me that i was totally and utterly stupid to have intervened			0
‘ they could have had a knife			0
and then where would we all be ? ’ littering stems from a lack of consideration for our fellow citizens , says radio presenter @entity0 it was a fair point , but in all honesty even after that horrible incident three years ago i would still confront yobs trashing the streets any day of the week			1
littering may seem small beer to some , but it demonstrates a blinding lack of consideration for and awareness of your fellow citizens			0
we see it all the time , do n’t we ? we see people who ca n’t be bothered heaving their lazy frames just a few yards to a bin			0
we see it in people who tip out an ashtray from a car window , or toss a drink can out the window while they ’re driving			0
what are they thinking ? i , perhaps naively , just ca n’t comprehend the mindset			0
so what can we do as a nation to stem this tide of litter ? the fast food outlets certainly need to do more to stop customers buying their food and drink and then just dumping the packaging wherever the hell they like			1
i ’d love one day to take a pile of pizza boxes back to the restaurant that handed them out and dump them over the counter			0
most of all , we need to make people realise and understand the consequences of their actions			0
we really are all in it together on this one			0
perhaps the social problems and solutions are too deep rooted and intractable for us to change easily , but we do have laws already that could be used more often to combat such a national problem			0
it is a criminal offence for a person to drop , throw down , or otherwise deposit and then leave litter			1
the offence of littering is covered in @entity222 and 88 of the @entity223 , and results — if it is ever prosecuted — in an average fine of around £ 100			0
but beyond employing litter patrols — rather like the @entity228 religious police — to roam around and arrest people , what do we do ? it is not my place as an impartial @entity235 journalist to suggest legislation , but there are some who advocate a draconian solution who would say we need laws like the ones they have they have in @entity245 , for example			1
there , litter louts can be fined nearly £ 500 for the first conviction , and more than £ 2,000 for repeat offences			1
on top of that , you are also made to do community labour , and if you offend three times , you ’ll have to wear a sign which states : ‘ i am a litter lout			1
’ many will undoubtedly say that is completely unreasonable , a waste of the courts ’ time , and a wholly and ludicrously over the top response to a relatively minor infraction			0
but do we seriously want the kind of society which has people walking round with signs telling the world they are litter louts ? although ... is that such a rubbish idea ?			1
