as the cities of @entity3 's @entity2 pray for the merciful end to a terrible winter , they face another huge headache once the clouds finally part : historically horrendous potholes			1
in fact , pothole purgatory has already begun			2
in @entity13 , road crews have patched a record 136,476 potholes since january 1			1
the @entity15 had filled just under 57,000 by this same time in 2013			1
@entity16 , famous for their meteorological stoicism , are reeling from what @entity20 public works commissioner @entity19 calls a ' pothole eruption			1
' more winter , more problems : @entity25 workers in @entity26 have applied more than 2,000 tons of patching material in the five counties around the city , according to spokesman @entity30 ' we filled our 6,000th pothole this morning since jan. 1 , ' @entity19 said tuesday			1
last year 's comparable figure was about 1,600			1
the pace was even too much for the city 's vaunted ' @entity35 ' — a massive truck that keeps the fill material hot en route to worksites			2
an electrical failure last weekend caused the heating core and hydraulic augers to quit , forcing workers to shovel up to 2 tons of dried asphalt from the machine 's bowels before the beast could hit the roads again , @entity19 says			1
in @entity26 , they 're not even attempting to keep count			2
' we 're just trying to keep up as best we can , ' says @entity30 , a spokesman for the @entity25			2
since dec. 1 , @entity25 workers have applied more than 2,000 tons of patching material in the five counties around the @entity26 , says @entity30			2
' it 's been a relentless winter season , ' he says			1
' it 's the recipe for potholes , ' agrees @entity19			1
' it 's just freeze - thaw - moisture , freeze - thaw - moisture , freeze - thaw - moisture			1
not just the @entity2 : a driver avoids a series of partially - patched potholes in the westbound lanes of the @entity71 tollway monday near @entity72 , @entity64 crews across @entity65 are working to fill potholes that have popped up on roads after the previous week 's blast of winter weather the @entity77 defines a pothole as ' localized distress in an asphalt - surfaced pavement resulting from the breakup of the asphalt surface and possibly the asphalt base course			1
' climate and traffic combine to remove pieces of asphalt , leaving potholes — and localized distress for drivers			1
normally , major pothole trouble comes in late february or early march			2
but this season 's ' polar vortex ' meant cities from the upper @entity95 to the @entity96 have been repeatedly pummeled by ice and snow since january — and produced an early crater crop			1
still , that would n't be as big a problem had the nation invested more up front , @entity100 and others say			0
in its report card on the nation 's infrastructure last year , the @entity106 gave @entity3 's roads a @entity111 in a recent post on the group 's blog , contributor @entity112 quipped that ' pothole - dodging could be an @entity119 sport			1
' but it 's no laughing matter			0
@entity106 estimates it would take an investment of $ 3.6 trillion by 2020 to ensure the safety of highways , bridges , the power grid and other public resources			0
@entity35 : heavy motor technicians troubleshoot an electrical problem on a pothole repair truck dubbed @entity35 as even battle - tested @entity20 's winter armor starts to show cracks pot shot : @entity16 , famous for their meteorological stoicism , are reeling from what @entity135 commissioner @entity19 calls a pothole eruption this winter @entity3 motorists are already paying the price : @entity140 , a nonprofit organization that researches surface transportation issues , released a report last year estimating that ' unacceptably rough ' roads cost the average urban driver $ 377 a year in repairs — or a total of $ 80 billion nationwide			1
is anyone doing roads right ? in an interview with the @entity151 newspaper about the state of @entity154 's roads , @entity155 , director of that nation 's @entity156 , even gave props to the ancient rival across the @entity160			1
' this sort of thing does n't happen in @entity164 or @entity165 , where they mend the roads properly , ' he said			1
@entity168 of the @entity169 thinks @entity3 could learn something from his country , which he believes has stricter rules on asphalt composition and road construction than the @entity3 to account for the wet and cold			0
he says additives such as cement and lime are compulsory in the top layer of asphalt on @entity181 roads , and that there are even stricter limits on air bubbles within the asphalt			1
' we take the frost in the ground into consideration when we construct our roads , and they do n't really do that in the @entity3 , ' he says			1
' we filled our 6,000th pothole this morning since jan. 1 , ' commissioner @entity19 of @entity20 said this week but he says @entity181 has also borrowed a page from road builders in @entity197 and @entity198 , who use rubber in the mix to avoid cracks			1
' some @entity3 states use it to a great extent , ' @entity168 says			0
' but not on the @entity206			0
' in fairness , @entity207 , a research professor at @entity209 's @entity208 , says it 's hard to compare @entity212 with @entity13			0
' you can go to parts of @entity164 where i 'm sure they do n't have to really do anything , because the roads are not really traveled as heavily , ' he says			1
' you do need that pounding of the traffic to really hit it			0
' regardless of what they 're doing elsewhere , what really matters is what 's happening right here at home , says @entity100			0
he says @entity3 pay about $ 21 a month on average in state and federal road taxes — a fraction of what they pay for cable television or a cell phone			0
' and yet what is one of our most expensive investments out there ? ' he says			0
' it 's our automobile			0
and we 're wrecking our automobiles because we 're hitting potholes ... the key is not fixing them			1
the key is preventing them			0
' but the patching goes on			0
' others are investing in so - called ' pothole killer ' machines , says @entity253			2
' a person right from the cab of the vehicle can blow highly compressed air to get all the water and debris out of a pothole , ' he marvels			0
' it unloads its asphalt and aggregate mixture down into there , and then it compacts it — all in one breath			0
and it just moves on to the next pothole			0
' trouble down south : this combination of feb. 12 , 2014 and june 9 , 1965 photos shows highway @entity269 going into @entity271 with the @entity272 in the background			0
an @entity106 estimate says it would take an investment of $ 3.6 trillion by 2020 to ensure the safety of highways , bridges , the power grid and other public resources still , much work being done this hectic season has been what those in the industry call ' throw - and - roll ' — slap some ' cold mix ' of stone and liquid asphalt into the hole , roll over it with the truck , and move on			2
researchers at @entity294 and the @entity295 in @entity296 found that applying a coat of bitumen emulsion between two layers of asphalt ' greatly improved its resistance to further cracks			0
' they also confirmed that a hot mix repair — in which the asphalt was heated to 284 degrees or higher — was the best option for fixing holes 1 inch and deeper			0
if ' a few simple and cost - effective measures are applied with each repair then there may be less need for as many repeat repairs , ' and savings could be in the millions annually , @entity307 , one of the study 's co-authors , said in a university release last february			2
all of this is cold comfort for @entity3 drivers			0
@entity320 , a spokesman for the @entity321 in @entity13 , says his branch received more than 13,000 calls for flat tires in january , a 25 percent increase over last year			2
' just about all flat tire calls are potholes , ' he says			2
@entity329 's streets are such a minefield that rolling over a hole is often the lesser of two evils , says @entity13 cabbie @entity333			0
' they 're deep and everywhere , ' says the 20 - year - old driver , whose cab suffered a blowout tuesday			1
' but sometimes in @entity13 , you ca n't avoid them			0
there 's too much traffic coming ... you just got to take a risk			0

ice cracked roads pose a new headache once the brutal winter finally ends
even winter - ready @entity20 has filled 6,000 potholes this year *--* nearly four times the number they *'d* filled this time last year
