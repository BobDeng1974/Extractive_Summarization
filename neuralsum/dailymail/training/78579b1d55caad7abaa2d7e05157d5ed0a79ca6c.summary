@entity0 has accused his critics of double standards in the wake of @entity5 's dramatic comeback win over @entity7 @entity6 in the @entity9 second round			1
the 27 year - old @entity10 was back on the practice courts on thursday ahead of his own third round against @entity13 , but before that he took to @entity14 and took a pointed swipe at reaction to the @entity5 win , which saw him come back from cramps to survive in five sets			1
' when i cramped and won in the @entity23 last year i was a " drama queen , unfit , needs to see a shrink , faker " weird … ' he posted			0
@entity0 's coach @entity24 takes evasive action as her charge practices on thursday @entity0 will resume his @entity9 campaign on friday against @entity13 @entity0 took to @entity14 to vent about what he perceives to be double standards when it comes to fatigue @entity0 worked up a sweat as he prepared for his third - round match on friday @entity0 hits with his partner while the @entity36 cricket ground can be seen in the background ( left ) @entity0 was clearly not having a go at @entity5 , but taking umbrage at what may have been said via various platforms about his match last year at @entity43 against @entity45 @entity44 , in which he suffered cramping before coming through in four sets			1
as someone who has come through his share of matches when he has had to overcome physical difficulty he feels there are some double standards at play			1
there are myriad of ways these days for anyone to express a personal view via social media – and many thousands of words will have passed the lips of broadcasters about the @entity44 match			0
however , an initial search of mainstream reports filed by those who were in @entity68 does not show up any obvious accusations that @entity0 was malingering in some way			1
@entity7 supercoach @entity71 is noted as having said : ' one minute @entity0 is dying , the next he is a gladiator			2
' but there does not appear any widespread suggestions of what the player thinks was said			0
@entity5 needed treatment during his second - round match against @entity6 @entity5 looked set to crash out of the tournament in the early stages before battling back to win in five sets @entity5 celebrates what at one stage looked an unlikely victory to progress into the third round @entity87 , for example , noted that he was ' cramping , limping and lolling around like a wounded beast ' before closing the match out in four sets when barely able to serve properly			1
but there is also the conclusion that ' it is much to @entity0 's credit that he still won			2
@entity97 competitors would have succumbed			0
' among the circumstances that some reports point out is that he and @entity44 were called very abruptly to the court with little time for preparation , as the preceding women 's match took only 47 minutes , and that he has a history of struggling on the @entity107 , where the match took place			0
@entity0 has been especially sensitive about how on court physical issues are portrayed since a match against @entity114 's @entity113 at the @entity115 , during which he suffered back spasms before coming through to win			1
@entity0 was troubled by cramp during his four - set epic against @entity44 at the @entity23 last year @entity119 called @entity0 a ' drama queen ' after he required treatment during the @entity122 in 2012 the commentating @entity119 used the term ' drama queen ' to describe his demeanour , which inevitably got plenty of traction in the media			2
this probably explains his latest outpouring on @entity14 , a fairly blunt instrument that affords precious little scope for wider explanation ( see his declaration about @entity136 independence , for example )			0
it also points to him being very much keyed up for this high - pressure fortnight , the next leg for him being friday 's encounter with world number 55 @entity13 from @entity143			0
it is probably a positive thing , as a sense of indignation has always been a powerful motivational tool for @entity0 .			0

@entity5 struggled with his fitness against @entity6
the @entity152 looked to be heading out but battled back to win in five sets
@entity0 believes there are double standards when it comes to fatigue
the @entity160 has been criticised in the past when cramping during matches
