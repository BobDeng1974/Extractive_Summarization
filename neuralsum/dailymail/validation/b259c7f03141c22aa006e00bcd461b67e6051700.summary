@entity0 returns to the @entity2 starting line - up on saturday with a clear vision of what is required — title glory , nothing less			1
@entity9 ’s @entity8 lock resumes his role as the team ’s lineout conductor and a vocal leader offering support to captain @entity14 , having overcome concussion and knee injuries which blighted a large chunk of his season			1
the 31 - year - old will commit body and soul to the @entity23 finale against @entity24 with an acute sense of @entity2 ’s need to reach a fresh peak and replace fading highlights			1
@entity0 is one of only five survivors from @entity2 's 38 - 21 victory against @entity31 in 2012 @entity2 ’s 38 - 21 win over world champions @entity31 at @entity34 in december 2012 is widely considered @entity35 ’s finest hour			1
but , just over two years on , only five of that starting xv are set to start against @entity24 ... @entity2 ( v @entity31 , december 1 , 2012 ) a @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 ; a @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 despite their best endeavours in the championship , @entity2 ’s most eye - catching achievement under @entity35 remains the record 38 - 21 demolition of @entity31			1
but that historic victory took place 27 months ago and @entity0 — a central figure on that heady day — craves a more substantial achievement			1
‘ after that @entity31 game i was obviously over the moon , but it was a one - off , ’ he said , after being recalled in place of @entity64 ’s @entity63			1
‘ we need something tangible now to say , “ look , we ’ve won the championship , this is what we ’ve got for our efforts — we can push on now with the goal of consistently beating any team that comes our way ”			2
this is a game with the championship on the line in which we need to show character			2
’ @entity0 feels that wo n’t be a problem			1
he believes the @entity2 squad contains plenty of men who have an abundance of the necessary character and fighting spirit ; men ready for the sort of taxing assignment that awaits tomorrow			2
@entity95 ( left ) , @entity92 ( centre ) and @entity94 get ready to pack down for a hit at the scrum machine ‘ there are a lot of players who enjoy those moments when you feel your backs are against the wall , ’ he said			1
‘ these games are when you see a team ’s character			2
we know there is a lot of pressure and we should n’t hide away from that			2
‘ we said at the start of the tournament : we have to win it			2
we ’ve come second three years running and we do n’t want that feeling again , but we ’ve got a chance here to put things right and win it			2
‘ we are good enough , with good enough players			2
the way we ’ve been progressing and with the players we ’ve got , it ’s still within our control to win a championship and i think we should put the pressure on ourselves to not accept anything less			0
’ @entity0 became a stalwart of the @entity8 ’ series triumph against @entity131 in the summer of 2013 , playing in all three tests , starting in two of them and excelling in that exalted company			1
that tour gave him a first - hand view of the talent available to @entity139 and @entity140 , who are vying with @entity2 for this year ’s championship title , but he is adamant @entity144 ’s squad contains talent to compare with their more established rivals			0
@entity147 sets sights on @entity24 following @entity150 win @entity0 will pack down with @entity152 lock @entity151 in the engine room for @entity2 against @entity24 he said : ‘ i see guys like @entity155 and the way he controls the game at 22			1
he comes across as so much more experienced			0
i see the talent in @entity159 ( @entity160 ) and @entity161			0
we have definitely got enough talent to win it			0
’ on a personal level , this is a welcome return to the starting xv for a player who has been a fixture throughout @entity35 ’s tenure and would have won more than his 22 @entity2 caps but for injuries			1
‘ i am chuffed to be playing again , but i also see it as the start of the hard work			0
i have n’t done anything yet , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i played every game between the autumn internationals and the @entity23 , then got the knee injury in the last game before meeting up , which was frustrating			1
‘ then i thought i might be fine , but probably pushed it too hard			0
’ @entity2 will need full back @entity180 at his attacking best against @entity181 at @entity34 his exploits as a replacement in the win over @entity150 convinced the management that @entity0 was worthy of a place alongside @entity151 at the heart of the pack in the only change to the starting line - up for a high - stakes instalment of ‘ @entity192 ’			1
@entity35 said : ‘ the experience @entity194 brings is important			0
he did n’t go on the @entity8 tour by accident			0
he ’s been a high - quality player			0
@entity194 has presence and speed around the field			0
his ability carrying the ball is excellent			0
’ @entity2 ’s head coach was asked if he would feel any joy in beating the @entity204 but not claiming the title			0
‘ eventually — potentially , ’ he said			0
‘ but i do n’t think i ’ll feel anything other than disappointment if we do n’t achieve it			0
’ nothing less than glory will suffice .			0

@entity0 has overcome concussion and knee injuries to take his place
@entity0 will pack down with @entity151 at lock against @entity24
the @entity9 lock has been recalled ahead of @entity63
