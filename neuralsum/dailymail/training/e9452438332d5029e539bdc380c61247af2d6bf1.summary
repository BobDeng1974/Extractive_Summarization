@entity1 's national airline is the world 's only carrier to be awarded just one star - for the fourth time in a row			1
@entity5 came last in a list of the world 's 600 carriers , ranked on in - flight meals , the skill of staff , aircraft age and efficiency			1
the dismal performance comes despite @entity1 leader @entity15 attempting to revitalise the country 's national airline and even rumours claiming the dictator wants cabin crew to wear skimpier uniforms			1
with no new aircraft purchased for over 20 years , a fleet of 64 obsolete planes that date back to the 1960s , it seems the urgings of the @entity44 have fallen on deaf ears			1
the fleet flies to 14 airports in six countries ; the most popular destinations are @entity50 and @entity51 in @entity52			0
as expected , in - flight entertainment is restricted to magazines and films detailing the great works of @entity1 's leader @entity15			1
due to the age of the aircraft , the cockpit is behind the times with no digital assistance luggage is still weighed by hand on old fashioned scales in the deserted airport customs lounge			1
the cabins look like something out of a museum , and the in - flight meals are constantly criticised by flyers			0
the findings were based on the skill - set of staff , standard of in - flight meals and entertainment , and quality of aircraft the aircraft for @entity5 can be dated back to the 1960s and are in urgent need of modernisiation if the fleet is to rise from one - star level the fleet flies to 14 airports in six countries ; the most popular destinations are @entity50 and @entity51 in @entity52 perhaps what will irk @entity15 even more is that six of the seven five - star airlines are all based out of the @entity90			1
@entity92 's @entity91 , @entity94 's @entity93 , @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity98 's @entity97 , @entity52 's @entity99 and @entity100 are all top of the tree , along with @entity103			0
photographer @entity104 from @entity105 gained unprecedented access to the @entity108 - era planes still used in @entity1 by the nation ’s civil carrier , @entity5 , plus cargo transporters and helicopters , after joining a tour for aviation enthusiasts inside the communist enclave			1
from the photos , the airline , which was founded in 1950 as a joint @entity1 - @entity108 partnership to connect the capital @entity119 with @entity120 , appears to be stuck in a time warp			1
photographer @entity104 was greeted by smiling @entity5 flight attendants dressed in smart navy blue outfits before he boarded an @entity126 plane , a large turboprop airliner			1
the @entity108 aircraft was first flown in 1957 inside the cockpit of the @entity126 - 18 things looks very different to modern planes , there is not a digital screen in sight the cockpit in the @entity126 plane , a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957 , is a long way from digital			1
astonishingly , the flight ’s communication officer appears to sit in the passenger seating area and listens in to air traffic control on an ancient pair of headphones			0
while the @entity126 is known for its durability , with many planes achieving over 45,000 flight hours , there is a bold contrast in its appearance to modern aircrafts			0
in march 2006 , due to safety and maintenance concerns , @entity5 was banned from flying into the @entity155			2
in march 2010 , the airline was allowed to resume operations but only with their tu - 204s aircraft			2
‘ at first i was a little nervous about flying , ’ mr @entity104 , who was on his third trip to @entity1 , told @entity160			1
however , he said after his first flight in a historic plane ‘ it was n’t scary at all ’			0
six of the top five - star airlines are in the @entity90 , which will more than likely anger @entity15 even more baggage check - in is a lot more old fashioned at @entity171 , a military airport near @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity1 an @entity5 flight to @entity175 , the main airport serving @entity1 , shows its ready for boarding			1
mr @entity104 flew from @entity177 into @entity119 with @entity5 on the august 25 the new modernised @entity175 is nearing completion and looks set to open in this year ' i was constantly looking forward to the next joyride			1
besides … there were 48 other members of the tour group and everyone was like a kid in the candy store			0
i could n’t possibly be nervous with everyone so psyched up about every ride , ’ he added			0
mr @entity104 flew out to @entity1 with @entity30 based company @entity189 , who have been running @entity1 aviation tours for the past three years			1
‘ the @entity1 is now the only country in the world where you can reliably fly on all major @entity108 era aircraft in one place , ’ their website informs			2
from the 11 - 20 september , the flyers experienced eight different aircraft types on both scheduled international and internal charter flights			0
inside the @entity126 there are blue chairs and blue carpet			0
curtains draw across the windows and overhead luggage is stored less securely than in modern planes not enough leg room ? seats on the @entity126 all fold down			0
but entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their @entity1 dramas and documentaries , mr @entity104 revealed the in - flight meal featured rice and chicken and fruit cocktail for desert			1
' the food is better than i expected , ' mr @entity104 commented in mr @entity104 ’s revealing photos , he shows the empty airport customs area at @entity119 , the main airport serving @entity1 , as well as a glimpse at the revamped @entity175 which looks set to open in 2015			1
a new airport is n’t the only update @entity1 is making to its airline			2
in 2013 , @entity5 appeared to be making efforts to update its image to the outside world , changing the uniforms worn by flight attendants from red and white to navy blue with a white studded trim			2
flight attendants smile in the smart outfits in mr @entity104 ’s photos , their black hair swept back into chic buns			2
' the air stewardess are polite and soft spoken			0
from what i understand , they never leave the plane to change shifts at @entity177 , ’ mr @entity104 said after his international flight			2
inside the plane , entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their @entity1 dramas and documentaries but the seats do fold down for extra leg room			1
in the services area of the @entity126 , a steward prepared the meals metal containers			0
unlabelled bottled water was stored in a tub the female flight attendants served drinks from plastic cups			0
in 2013 some of the attendants ' uniforms changed from red and white to navy blue with studded white trim life vests are stored under the seats of the @entity126 in case of emergencies			0
the toilet area features an old fifties interior mr @entity104 has previously visited @entity1 twice , and in 2013 he witnessed bustling markets , men and women enjoying themselves at a @entity278 looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest , shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to @entity1 would entail			1
this time he said his trip was ' a very different experience ' because he was n't on his own with just official guides to keep him company			0
‘ i ended up being the odd one out … it was like i attended a @entity293 convention and everybody was speaking @entity295			0
these guys absolutely love and know their planes , ’ mr @entity104 said of joining the aviation fans			2
‘ the tour group were all over the runway , happily snapping away at the planes			2
and the @entity1 government did n’t even mind one bit , ’ he said			0
in one of mr @entity104 ’s videos the tour group is seen running across the runway in a dash to get the best seats on the plane			2
and despite @entity1 being known as highly - secretive , the photographer believes his latest tour shows things are becoming more open			2
‘ it 's a huge leap forward in terms of relaxing the rules			0
everyone was even allowed into the cockpits to take photos , ’ he said			0
the communications officer on the flight sat outside the cockpit in the passenger area and listened in with an ancient looking pair of headphones the old green seats in the @entity126 cockpit are covered with beige material			0
the empty weight of the plane is 35,000 kg mr @entity104 also took a flight on the @entity331 made @entity332			0
' i 'm told this particular plane is only four years old , ' he said the safety instructions on board the flights were in both @entity1 and @entity338 mr @entity104 said : ' the air stewardess are polite and soft spoken			1
from what i understand , they never leave the plane to change shifts at @entity177 ' toilets in the @entity332 were ' clean ' and had ' no foul smell '			0
mr @entity104 flew into @entity119 again with @entity346 on september 13 a red , white and blue @entity5 shuttle boss transports passengers from the terminal to the planes the airport customs area looks remarkably quiet in @entity1 and only one man appears to be working at the desks mr @entity104 boarded a night flight at @entity175 with 49 other passengers from 13 different countries he took a flight on @entity5 's @entity358 , a @entity108 - designed medium twin - turbine transport helicopter while flying mr @entity104 believes he spotted a @entity361 plane sharing the same skies			1
' look what i saw outside the window of @entity366 , ' he said for more photos from @entity104 's @entity1 trips visit his website and @entity371 page .			1

@entity5 is given one - star rating for the fourth consecutive year , and is bottom of world airline rankings
this is despite @entity1 *supreme* leader @entity15 's plans to *revolutionise* the fleet
the age of planes date back to the 1960s , and cockpits have no digital assistance
@entity104 , from @entity105 , visited @entity1 with a group of aviation enthusiasts
he flew from @entity177 , @entity389 , into the communist nation 's capital , @entity119
on board entertainment was limited to only one channel playing @entity1 dramas and documentaries
he was ' nervous ' about flying on the ancient planes to begin with but then found it *exciting*
