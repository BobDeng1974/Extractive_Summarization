heroics : @entity1 , a @entity2 , leapt into action after the device fell through the roof of her owner 's house bombs rained down and flames roared through the streets as the @entity11 launched wave after wave of attacks			1
it was 1941 , and the house where @entity1 the @entity2 lived with her owner was one of the unlucky ones			1
an incendiary bomb ripped through the roof , and would have destroyed everything – if it had n’t been , it seems , for @entity1 ’s well - timed need to spend a penny			2
she is thought to have relieved herself over the bomb , defusing it and saving the house			2
her actions in the @entity28 earned her a @entity29			0
but that was only the first time @entity1 demonstrated her firefighting skills during the @entity33			2
three years later , she received a second @entity29 – awarded for animal bravery – when she alerted customers to a fire tearing through her owner ’s shoe shop			1
her story was only revealed when auctioneers conducted a house clearance at a property in @entity43 and discovered the second medal , along with a portrait of @entity1			1
a plaque attached to the portrait reads : ‘ @entity1 – awarded a medal for extinguishing an incendiary bomb april 1941			1
awarded another for alerting the occupants of her master ’s burning shop november 1944			0
’ the medal and portrait sold at auction for £ 1,100 , more than 18 times the pre-sale estimate			2
@entity57 , auctioneer at @entity59 in @entity60 , said : ‘ we are constantly finding treasures during house clearouts , many with fascinating stories behind them			0
this medal and portrait are a perfect example			2
‘ they were found at two different stages of a house clearance at a property in @entity43 that belonged to a relative of @entity1 ’s owner			1
‘ we united the two and were able to lift the lid on an incredible story			0
interesting : her fascinating story was only revealed when auctioneers conducted a house clearance in @entity43 wreckage : @entity81 inspects bomb damage in @entity43 on a visit in december 1940			1
earlier in the month the city had been hit by two major attacks during the @entity33 @entity86 ( from the @entity88 word , ' lightning ' ) was the most intense bombing campaign @entity91 has ever seen			0
between september 1940 and may 1941 there were major raids with more than 100 tonnes of high explosives dropped on 16 @entity91 cities			0
@entity96 was attacked 71 times and bombed by the @entity11 for 57 consecutive nights			0
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 were also hit eight times , @entity43 six , @entity103 five , @entity104 four , @entity105 three , and there was also at least one large raid on another eight cities			0
‘ the inscription on the @entity29 states it was presented to @entity1 , a @entity2 , after she warned her master of a fire that was tearing through his shop in 1944			1
‘ as if that was n’t amazing enough , the plaque on the framed portrait of @entity1 revealed she had been awarded another @entity29 award previously in 1941			1
that time she was given the award for putting out an incendiary bomb that had crashed through the roof of her owner ’s house			2
‘ i ’ve never heard of a dog being able to extinguish a bomb before – one can only assume this was a @entity2 with a great bladder			0
’ he added : ‘ these items tell a fantastic story and highlight the often - forgotten role that animals played in the war			0
’ but @entity1 ’s story had an unhappy ending			0
she died only a year after the war ended – killed by poison posted through her owner ’s letterbox .			1
