by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 1 august 2012 the huge pile of cash handed to the @entity4 by the @entity5 has soared to a whopping £ 53 million per day , it was revealed today			1
@entity5 's annual contribution for being a member is now at a record £ 19.2 billion and the nation is getting back even less cash in return , the @entity6 has revealed			1
in 2010 the @entity5 's overall bill was £ 18.2billion , meaning that the £ 1 billion increase last year is an inflation - busting five per cent rise			1
this means that now every @entity18 is contributing £ 300 a year each to maintain our link with @entity21			1
@entity22 : @entity5 now pays £ 19.2 billion per year to the @entity4 in @entity21 , pictured , an increase of £ 1 billion and after taking into account what the country gets back in subsidies for forming and regional development projects , @entity5 paid £ 8.4billion more than it received last year compared to £ 7.3 billion in 2010 - an increase of £ 1.1 billion			1
in total since 1979 , @entity5 has paid in about £ 228 billion and has received back in benefits just £ 143 billion			1
after @entity33 's @entity32 , @entity5 is the second highest contributor of the 27 @entity4 members			2
claims : @entity37 says he has got a good deal for @entity5 and maintains he does n't want to leave the @entity4 @entity40 leader and mep @entity39 said : ' 19 billion here , 19 billion there , pretty soon we are talking real money			1
in our terms this is as much as we spend on the @entity47 and justice combined			0
' that the daily figure has topped £ 53 million a day is astonishing and something that this government just can not be proud of while it attempts to rein in the scourge of public spending			1
' we know the costs of @entity57 , the question remains , what are the benefits ? @entity37 refuses to sanction a proper study into this , and we know why , there is simply no justification for taking so much from the public purse to fritter elsewhere			0
of course by the public purse i mean the taxpayer			0
' @entity37 is facing huge pressure from the public and his own party over @entity5 's membership of the @entity4			2
just weeks ago the prime minister said he wanted a ‘ new settlement ’ with @entity57 , but suggested this would stop short of @entity5 quitting the @entity4			2
mr @entity37 criticised @entity76 who want to leave , saying their vision for @entity5 would create ‘ a sort of greater @entity80 ... that would be a complete denial of our national interest ’			2
asked whether he could ever envisage campaigning for @entity5 to leave the @entity4 , mr @entity37 replied : ‘ i do n’t think we should leave the @entity4			0
big spenders : only @entity33 's @entity32 gives more to the @entity4 than @entity5 ‘ but i think we should be , over time , seeking a new settlement and receiving a new mandate for that settlement			0
because i think the change taking place in @entity57 is very profound			0
i think this is perfectly possible			0
’ the prime minister has already accepted a 2.8 per cent increase in next year 's @entity4 budget but the government maintains they are getting a good deal			0
' the government has consistently pressed for restraint in the @entity4 budget and achieved a real - terms freeze in the 2012 budget , ' a @entity99 spokesman told the @entity105			0
net spending : this graphic shows how much @entity5 has spent and got back since 1979 and the gap is widening			2

total up from £ 18.2 billion a year in 2010
@entity5 now sending £ 53 million per day to @entity21
but @entity5 is also getting back £ *1.3* billion less than it did a year ago
