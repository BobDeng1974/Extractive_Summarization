@entity0 had stomach pain for months and underwent many tests
had three scans , two blood tests and six pregnancy tests but none revealed the pregnancy so it was eventually *decided* her ovaries were *responsible*
during surgery to remove them , surgeons found a healthy baby boy
woke her up briefly to say the surgery was being changed to a caesarean
@entity43 is now a healthy seven - month - old and an *investigation* is underway to discover how the pregnancy could have been missed
