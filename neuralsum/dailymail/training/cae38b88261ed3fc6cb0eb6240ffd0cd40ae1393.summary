@entity0 broke hearts earlier this month when , in its dying moments , it managed to send back valuable data from comet @entity5			1
but , all is not lost			0
@entity9 engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as march next year , as comet @entity12 gets closer to the sun. the probe is currently only receiving around an hour of sunlight during the comet 's 12 - hour day , with its batteries frozen in temperatures of -170 ° @entity20 back from the dead : @entity0 ( pictured ) broke hearts earlier this month when , in its dying moments , it managed to send back valuable data from comet @entity24 – @entity25			1
now , @entity9 engineers claim it could come back to life in march 2015 as comet @entity12 gets closer to the sun previous estimates simply said the probe could awaken within ' the next few months ' , but now a more precise timeframe has been revealed			1
in a recent @entity35 ' ask me anything ' session , engineers at mission control said : ' we expect to have enough energy to boot around march next year			2
' then @entity0 needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery			2
the batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels , but because @entity0 hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown , it ended up in shadow			1
' it is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in @entity54 just below the @entity55 during the winter , ' said @entity57 , @entity0 systems engineer			1
' welcome to a comet ! ' : earlier this month , @entity59 tweeted this remarkable picture from comet @entity12 confirming that @entity0 is successfully on the surface			1
it bounced twice before landing in almost complete darkness engineers claim the seasonal change toward spring in @entity0 's hemisphere will bring the probe into much more sunlight over the next few months			1
that , coupled with the fact that the comet is getting closer to the sun , should warm up the batteries enough to keep them charged			2
@entity74 , manager of the @entity0 lander , added that he was ' very optimistic ' that it would soon wake up			1
the amount of science that the team will be able to do will depends on how long it takes to recharge the batteries , he said			0
the historic touchdown of @entity0 on a comet could be big step toward ' moving off this planet ' and ' taking ' the entire solar system the historic touchdown of @entity0 on comet @entity5 could be big step toward ' moving off this planet ' and ' taking ' the entire solar system			1
this is according to @entity92 's planetary science head , @entity93 , who said the solar system is now in reach of wider human exploration			1
the space agency is hoping to send humans to @entity100 in the 2030s , and data from @entity9 's mission could help make that a reality by revealing more planets in our solar system			1
' how audacious ! how exciting ! ' @entity93 said , after the landing was made			2
' the solar system is mankind 's - this mission is the first step to take it			1
' it 's ours … it 's these steps that will lead us beyond this planet and on to @entity100 and out into the solar system			1
' ' i truly believe that a single planet species will not survive long			0
it 's our destiny to move off this planet			0
' @entity92 described yesterday 's landing as ' a great day for space exploration			0
' ' we congratulate @entity59 on their successful landing on a comet today , ' said @entity129			2
' this achievement represents a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation			1
' scientists hope that samples drilled out from the comet will unlock details about how the planets - and possibly even life - evolved			0
comets date back to the formation of the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago			1
scientists suspect impacting comets delivered water to early @entity147			0
during the @entity35 , the team also said that one of the biggest limitations of the mission was using decades old technology			2
' the biggest drawback for @entity0 was the limited computer power and mass memory , ' said @entity156 , science manager for @entity9			1
' what we could install there - 800 @entity157 and some memory - seems to be from another world today '			0
the @entity9 probe , which was carrying @entity0 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity147 and @entity100 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity167			1
it chased comet @entity24 – @entity25 through space for more than ten years			2
this image , annotated by @entity171 from @entity172 , shows the precarious position the lander is currently in			0
at the top the view into space can be seen			0
one of the feet is obscured from view			0
the bottom left image is the direction that the @entity183 instrument was deployed to take readings from the surface despite this , after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe successfully released @entity0 from its grip to land on the comet , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			2
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			2
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
scientists recently said they had detected what might be complex carbon compounds on the surface of the comet the craft landed on two weeks ago			0
the team in @entity212 , @entity213 , are pictured here celebrating as news of @entity0 's separation from @entity9			1
scientists hope the £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science - including the origins of life on @entity147 the team leader for the @entity224 instrument , professor @entity222 , told @entity225 : ' we can say with absolute certainty that we saw a very large signal of what are basically organic ( carbon ) compounds			0
' there is a rich signal there			0
it is not like there are two compounds ; there are clearly a lot of things there - a lot of peaks			0
sometimes a complicated compound can give a lot of peaks			0
' scientists hope the £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science - including the origins of life on @entity147			0
open university professor @entity222 , who helped create @entity224 , said : ‘ the idea that comets may have brought the building blocks of life to @entity147 is one of the reasons why we want to study them			0
’ professor @entity260 , planetary scientist at the @entity261 , added : ‘ it is an interesting relic from that otherwise inaccessible epoch			0

claim was made during a @entity266 with the @entity9 mission team
@entity0 probe is now receiving just one hour of sunlight on comet @entity12
this is because it bounced before landing in shadow at *rim* of a crater
but as comet @entity12 travels closer to the sun , engineers could revive it
they say they are ' very optimistic ' that @entity0 will soon wake up
data could reveal how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago
previous estimates said the probe could awaken within ' the next few months ' , but now a more precise time frame has been revealed
