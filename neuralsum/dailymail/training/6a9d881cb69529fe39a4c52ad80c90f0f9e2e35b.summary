he is said to have rented a property near the @entity132 for the 46 - year - old and her legal team			0
so undeterred was her tendency to preside over others that even as her ' car crash ' personal life was revealed in open court , the harem of lawyers working around @entity28 referred to her as ' @entity205 ' - @entity206			0
and while details of her ' car crash ' personal life were agonised over in court - jurors were told of her struggles conceiving a baby and were read an excruciatingly personal letter to her former lover , co-defendant @entity113 , @entity28 remained defiant			0
