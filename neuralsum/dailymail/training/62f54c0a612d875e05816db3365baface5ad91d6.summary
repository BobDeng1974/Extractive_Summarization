these remarkable images show some of the earliest known examples of what we these days might dub pornography			1
the @entity5 , in @entity6 , north - west @entity7 , depict an intense fertility ritual the likes of which is almost unique in the ancient world			1
that 's because while most prehistoric art presents images that are abstract and disembodied , this tableau appears to explicitly present our sex - crazed ancestors in the midst of a wild orgy			1
@entity20 : the first scene shows nine massive females , each about two metres high , dancing arond in a circle , while a second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about to fall into a trance the petroglyphs - thought to date back to the second millennium @entity29 , although their exact age is difficult to determine - were discovered in the late eighties by @entity7 archaeologist @entity32			1
@entity33 , an expert on @entity35 nomads , was the first westerner to see them and detail them in scientific journals			1
nevertheless they remain little known			1
one of her descriptions of the tableau is featured on the website of the @entity44 , where she is currently executive director			1
the @entity46 are carved in bas - relief in a sheltered grotto , at the base of a massive red - basalt outcrop in @entity51 , about 45 miles west of @entity52 , the capital of @entity6 province			1
the cast of about 100 figures , which range in size from more than nine feet tall to just a few inches , are taking part in what is obviously a fertility ritual			1
almost all are depicted in the same ceremonial pose , in which their arms are held out and bent at the elbows with one hand pointing up and the other pointing down			1
location : the petroglyphs are carved in bas - relief in a sheltered grotto at the base of this red - basalt outcrop in @entity51 , in @entity6 , west @entity7 ' in addition , human figures , floating heads , meandering dogs , static felines , and heraldic animals fill voids , ' dr @entity74 writes			1
' to the ancients each image most surely represented some aspect of the ritual			1
' it is believed that the larger - than - life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females , with their stylised triangular torsos , and shapely hips and legs			1
these figures wear conical headdresses with wispy decorations			2
males , on the other hand , are depicted as smaller triangles with spindly stick legs , bare heads and mainly erect penises - dubbed ' ithyphallic ' in archaeology speak			2
many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features			1
@entity110 but wearing female headgear and chest decorations , they sometimes also wear masks and may depict shamans			1
' in general , the figures are represented in a dance so intense that some have fallen into a trance or state of ecstasy , ' writes dr @entity74			1
' others are about to engage in sexual intercourse with the obvious intent of procreation as small embryonic images evoking chorus lines emphasise the significance of this act			2
' the various animals add notes of ambiguity , yet provide additional clues to place the tableau in time and space and provide some historical basis			2
' she distinguishes eight separate scenes in the tableau , four of which are fully formed and the remainder of which appear to be sketches			2
@entity142 crazed : the second scene of the petroglyphs			2
it is believed that the larger - than - life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females , with their stylised triangular torsos , and shapely hips and legs the first scene shows nine massive females , each about two metres high , dancing arond in a circle , while a second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about to fall into a trance			2
a 12 - inch rock carving discovered in a cave in central @entity161 is now the earliest - known art in the @entity163			2
and with a phallus nearly as big as his arm , ' little horny man ' is also testament that man was fascinated with his genitals even 11,000 years ago			2
the archaeologists who found the stick figure carving believe it is linked to a fertility ritual of the early residents of the region			1
they believe it could help shine light on exactly when prehistoric humans migrated to the @entity179			2
the carving was found in 2009 in @entity181 do @entity182 -- a massive rock shelter where researchers from the @entity185 in @entity161 had already dug up human bones , tools , ash from hearth and the ancient remainders of meals of fruit and small animals , according to @entity194			1
the carving has been dated as being 9,000 to 12,000 years old			2
it is the only scene withoug ithyphallic men , although the transexual featured does have an erect penis			2
' it wears a female headdress with antenna and a “ bra ” ... ' writes dr @entity74			0
' although its torso and legs are stylized as the male and it is ithyphallic			0
' both arms , raised over its shoulders , have deviated from the normal dancing position			0
' to complete the scene a single human head and two pairs of heraldic animals , probably goats — one pair markedly ithyphallic — are interspaced between the female dancers			0
' it is the second scene identified by @entity221 that appears to show the wildest orgy of all			1
in it sixteen figures - 10 female and six male - look set to begin having sex , with one particularly unusual one on the left wearing a monkey mask and probably representing a shaman			0
' as it is ithyphallic it is also a bi-sexual representation and it appears that it about to copulate with a small female with splayed legs whose vulva is explicit , ' she writes			0
next to it is a headless male who looks like he 's trying to have sex with another transexual figure			0
at the centre of the scene is another prominent transexual figure who appears about to have sex with a smaller female with splayed legs , whose private parts are quite explicitly rendered			1
another large female figure seems to have two heads , and is positioned in the foreground as if leading the dance			0
dr @entity74 describes how it is stained stained red , ' perhaps suggesting heat '			0
nearby , below the figure wearing the monkey mask , are a pair of ithyphallic striped feline animals surrounded by three bows which appear to have arrows which are about to be discharged			0
the third scene is smaller more crudely rendered , containing nine figures , three female and six male , all apparently about to have sex			0
dr @entity74 identifies two images which stand out			0
' first , the male at the left with testicles and grossly exaggerated penis attempts to mate with the second important figure , the adjacent female , ' she writes			0
to this female ’s left are three more males eager for their turn to have sex with her			0
dr @entity74 adds : ' in this scene the importance of progeny is emphasized with the portrayal of two rows of small anthropomorphic figures			0
' the third scene : many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features			1
@entity110 but wearing female headgear and chest decorations , they may depict shamans ancient : the final scene , which appears according to one writer ' a lot like a frat party '			1
it shows 14 characters , seven of which have erect penises , apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance the final scene contains no obviously female figures at all , and one writer for @entity309 described it as looking ' a lot like a frat party '			0
it shows 14 characters , seven of which have erect penises , apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance			0
how they look in situ : almost all the figures are depicted in the same ceremonial pose , with arms held out and bent at the elbows near the bottom is a single male , who appears to masturbating alone with a stream of babies emanating from his penis			0
curiously for their location , all the figures presented in the @entity5 appear to be caucasoid , which fits in with other evidence which suggested the residents of this region of what is now @entity7 were nomads with @entity335 characteristics			0
dr @entity74 believes the tableau was probably some kind of storyboard for groups of cultic leaders that was used until about @entity341			0
' [ this ] interpretation of the tableau is reasonable as follows , ' she writes			0
' many personages are represented , with about half being female ( priestesses ) and the other half being males ( priests )			0
' slightly more than half the males had assumed a bisexual gender role , being ithyphallic and cross-dressing as priestesses with high headdresses			0
' all these personages are engaged in a ritual fertility / procreation dance with some engaged in symbolic copulation that would result in procreation			1
' lines of tiny images are , figuratively , the resulting progeny			0
' if she is correct , that makes ancient pornography rather more meaningful than today 's			1
