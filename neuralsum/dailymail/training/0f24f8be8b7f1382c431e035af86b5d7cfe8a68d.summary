by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 2 january 2013 we spend around 10 per cent of our waking hours with our eyes shut			0
and while it 's commonly thought that we blink to keep our eyes lubricated , it seems a lot of the time it 's because our brains need a little nap			1
new research suggests that the human brain uses that tiny moment of shut - eye to power down			0
blink and you 'll miss it : scientists find that blinking is a chance for our brains to power down researchers from @entity22 's @entity21 found that the mental break can last anywhere from a split second to a few seconds before attention is fully restored			1
scans that track the ebb and flow of blood within the brain revealed that regions associated with paying close attention momentarily go offline			0
the brain then goes into a ' default mode network ' , or idle setting			2
the same setting is engaged when our attention is not required by a cognitive task such as reading or speaking and our thoughts wander freely			1
@entity44 nap : blinking allows the brain to go into idle mode during this mode we tend to contemplate our feelings ; we wonder what a friend meant by a recent comment ; we consider something we did last week , or imagine what we 'll do tomorrow			1
while listening to another person or reading , that usually comes at the end of a sentence and while watching a film , we 're most likely to blink when an actor leaves the scene or when the camera shifts			0
most of us take between 15 and 20 such moments of downtime per minute			1
the new research , published this week in the journal @entity68 , studied 20 healthy young subjects in a brain scanner as they watched snippets from the @entity73 comedy @entity74			0
when subjects blinked , the researchers detected a momentary stand - down within the brain 's visual cortex and somatosensory cortex -- both involved with processing visual stimuli - and in areas that govern attention			2
separate studies on blinking have shown that while telling a lie , people have been found to blink less			0
in the seconds after telling a lie , however , the liar will blink far more frequently than a truth - teller .			2

when we blink , our brains goes into idle mode where thoughts wander freely , say @entity22 researchers
these mental breaks can last anywhere from a split second to a few seconds before attention is fully restored
most of us take between 15 and 20 such moments of downtime per minute
