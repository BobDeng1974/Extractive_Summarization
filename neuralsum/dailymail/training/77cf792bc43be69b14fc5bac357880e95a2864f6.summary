an investigation by mobile security firm @entity9 into public @entity3 networks has found 51 per cent of free hotspots in the @entity5 let users access adult and explicit content			1
the research also discovered one in three @entity5 cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all , leaving children in danger or accessing pornography technology magazine @entity37 recently tested 15 of the most popular web filters used in homes and discovered only three blocked 100 per cent of porn			1
the investigations included free and paid - for services			2
it also tested each filter using pro-anorexia , pro-suicide , gore and gambling sites , as well as sites classed as containing ' hate ' or ' tasteless humour '			2
more than 150 sites were used , yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit , adult or inappropriate content			2
@entity55 was the best performing filter , while @entity57 was the worst			0
mystery shoppers in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 attempted to access inappropriate content including pornography , drug - and violence - related sites			1
the investigation found over half ( 53 per cent ) of cafes and restaurants do not have any restrictions in place to block online stores selling knives and swords			2
while four out of five ( 80 per cent ) also granted full access to drug - related content such as @entity77			1
' for every parent across the @entity5 this report will come as an unwelcome surprise , ' said @entity81 , vice president product strategy and business development at @entity9			2
' in the last two years there have been two convergent trends : a big increase in public @entity3 and greater access to smartphones , gaming consoles and tablets with a @entity3 capability , the kind of device a child could have			0
' most people will instinctively block adult content when it comes to filtering , but what these results show is that we should also be looking at content related to drugs and violence which are just as harmful but frequently overlooked			1
' the report examined web filters across cafes , restaurants , hotels , retailers and public spaces			0
hotels scored the worst with 74 per cent not blocking pornography			0
government - owned public spaces such as train stations had the strongest filters with more than 90 per cent of them restricting access to pornography the report examined web filters across cafes , restaurants , hotels , retailers and public spaces			1
hotels scored the worst out of the five categories , with three out of four ( 74 per cent ) not blocking pornography and only one in ten actively blocking online weapons shops			0
during a similar investigation in the @entity128 , researchers found 72 per cent of @entity128 cafes and restaurants have no restrictions on access to pornography - more than double the @entity5			1
' having filters in public spaces is just as important as other restrictions such as the smoking ban and modesty covers on adult magazines , ' says @entity139 , professor of social responsibility in @entity141 , @entity142			0
' the fact that this protection is n't available in a significant proportion of publicly accessible sites will undoubtedly cause concern			0
' however , we should also reflect on the effectiveness of some of those in place - simply having a filter does n't necessarily mean everything is protected			1
' these results should encourage public outlets across the @entity5 to review the @entity3 services that they have in place and ensure that they are fit for purpose and appropriate for their customers			1
' government - owned property and public spaces , such as train stations , had the strongest filters			0
more than 90 per cent of government sites restricted access to pornography , although one in three granted full access to online weapons stores			1
research was carried out during september 2013 across 179 locations in @entity61 , @entity60 and @entity59 in the @entity5 and 86 locations in @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 in the @entity128 research staff visited cafes , restaurants , retail outlets , hotels and public spaces and attempted to log onto various websites			1
these sites include @entity186 ( @entity187 ) , @entity24 ( adult dating ) , @entity189 ( knife purchases ) and @entity191 ( drugs )			2
each website was scored using an ' accessibility matrix ' created in partnership with @entity139 , professor at the @entity196			0
it recorded any measures that prevented staff from logging onto websites , including the need for personal details , credit card numbers or branded warnings from the cafe , hotel and so on			0
all research staff were over 18 at the time of the research and consented to be part of the project			0
similarly , @entity214 - owned @entity213 automatically filters adult content at hotspots in public places			1
@entity213 is used in more than 20,000 hotspots , including @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 and applies the filter by default			0
a spokesman told @entity226 : ' we believe that parents want peace of mind that their children can not inadvertently access adult material when out of home			0
' that ’s why we were the first @entity3 provider to apply content filters as default across our entire network			0
' @entity81 added : ' cafes , restaurants , hotels and administrators of public spaces should talk to their @entity243 and other bodies to understand the most appropriate filtering methods for their premises			0
' ' whilst hotels are predominantly private places , where a ‘ no filtering ’ policy may be appropriate , hotel lobbies , cafes and restaurants are more public and the content policy should reflect this			2
' it is certainly neither a simple nor a ‘ one size fits all ’ matter , and the community should work together to understand the issues and put a suitable policy in place			0

one in three @entity5 cafes and restaurant have no filtering in place at all
during investigations , a fifth of hotspots failed to filter sex dating sites
80 *%* of establishments also granted full access to drug - related content
