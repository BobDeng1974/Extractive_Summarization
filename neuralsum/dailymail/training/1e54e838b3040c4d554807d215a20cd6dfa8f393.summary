by @entity0 @entity1 sent out a warning shot to @entity4 's @entity3 as the @entity6 striker tore @entity9 club giants @entity7 to pieces in the @entity13 's final @entity12 warm - up			1
six days out from their meeting in @entity17 , @entity15 's Â £ 15.6million new boy scored a hat trick and set up two for @entity19 as the @entity6 ran out 5 - 3 winners in @entity21			1
top scorer in @entity23 for @entity24 this season , @entity1 may have given @entity26 a dilemma			2
but so too did his leaky defence as the @entity6 looked shaky across the backline , conceding three goals to the club side			0
hero : @entity1 scored a hat - trick to help @entity13 to victory on sunday night opener : @entity13 's @entity19 celebrates scoring the first goal of the game against @entity7 in front : @entity19 scored in the 23rd minute to give @entity26 's side the lead ready : @entity41 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates during @entity13 's final warm - up match before the @entity12 @entity7 : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ( c ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			1
goals : @entity57 ( 28 ) ; @entity58 ( 36 ) ; @entity59 ( 62 )			0
@entity13 : @entity60 ; @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( c ) , @entity68 ; @entity1 , @entity41			1
goals : @entity70 ( 22 , 56 ) @entity1 ( 30 , 54 , 55 )			1
ref : @entity71 ( @entity72 ) the ninth best team in the world against an outfit sitting second in the @entity76 , for a time it looked like this could be another pre-tournament blip from the @entity6			0
fresh from a dour stalemate with the @entity81 and a shock 1 - 1 draw with minnows @entity84 , @entity26 sent out his second string to right some wrongs			0
and yet they found themselves again level after a chaotic first half			0
in the absence of @entity93 and @entity94 it was left to @entity1 to lead the line as @entity13 's lone striker with @entity41 and @entity68 operating off him			1
once things warmed up , it was to prove a lethal combination			0
@entity66 , operating alongside skipper @entity67 in front of @entity65 in the @entity13 engine room , split the defence with a delicious ball on 26 minutes			2
@entity1 looked very mobile as he sprung the offside trap , rounded @entity45 in goals and unselfishly ( especially so considering he had yet to open his international account at that stage ) crossed for @entity41 to tap in			2
but @entity7 roared back and having ignored the early warning signs the @entity6 defence were undone by @entity51			2
the @entity110 was not so long ago one of the highest paid players in the world when he played under @entity13 's @entity115 winning coach @entity114 in @entity116 , and he was relishing this stage			2
a beautiful ball sent @entity55 clear down the left and his cross left @entity57 with a tap in			0
not giving up : @entity7 pulled @entity13 back twice during the first half leap : @entity1 ( second right ) jumps above the @entity7 defence to score @entity13 's second goal @entity127 ? immobile celebrates with team - mate @entity63 ( right ) it sent the partisan capacity crowd into raptures and was yet another pre-tournament wake - up call for the @entity6			1
they responded rapidly though when @entity19 returned the favour for @entity1 to break his national team duck on his third cap			1
a wicked free kick from the left was flashed into the far corner off the striker 's head and @entity13 were back in front			2
but again it was not for long ... five minutes to be exact as left back @entity48 was allowed free reign by @entity145 's @entity61 to send a weak shot across the face of goal that somehow squirmed under debutant @entity60			0
it 's pretty clear why @entity150 has 140 caps to his name			0
but all was changed utterly in a stunning three - minute spell after the interval when the second string had surely been on the sharp end of @entity26 's tongue			0
@entity1 was unplayable as he roamed across the @entity7 backline			1
first he was on hand to tap in the rebound when @entity68 's shot was parried			0
less than 60 seconds later he again made a joke of the offside trap to latch on to @entity67 's pass and expertly finish for his hat - trick			1
tricky : @entity68 ( centre ) attempts to battle past three @entity7 players finish : @entity1 ( left ) beats @entity7 's goalkeeper @entity45 then another minute later he repeated the trick a third time and again centred for @entity41 's second			1
@entity13 were somehow 5 - 2 up after 54 minutes and @entity26 was free to empty the bench making the fourth official 's life a nightmare with an eight - man substitution on the hour mark			2
in came @entity178 , @entity93 , @entity179 - shaking off a training knock - and others			0
while substitute @entity59 scored perhaps the pick of a fine bunch of goals with a pile - driver on 62 minutes , the @entity6 a late injury scare when @entity93 crumpled under a challenge briefly had hearts in mouth but the @entity145 striker was fine to play out the game on a night that very much belonged to @entity1			1
@entity193 : @entity26 ( right ) watched his team in action for the last time before the @entity196			0

@entity13 score three goals in just over two minuted during *friendly* win against @entity7
@entity1 scored a hat - trick to help @entity13 to victory
@entity204 star and @entity206 target @entity19 *bagged* a brace
@entity13 will now prepare for their opening @entity12 match against @entity3
