by @entity0 for @entity1 gadgets almost running out of battery can often strike fear in their owners but this man became even more panic stricken when he realised his camera drone was about to run out power over a lake			1
the man was flying his drone fitted with a hd - 3d camera for just the second time over the water in his back garden in @entity17 , @entity18 when he noticed the battery on the gadget was running dangerously low			1
he then realised that he had to retrieve it quickly , and made a desperate dash , emptying his pockets and runs straight into the water fully - clothed to save his drone			1
the footage , filmed by the camera , starts showing the man , and what appears to be his family , enjoying a day by the lake in their garden with one of the children even wading in the water			1
but then as the drone begins to fall , he realises that the battery is about to run out and he can be seen laying his @entity64 on the ground and running towards the lake			2
after pausing for a second at the lake 's edge , he then removes his wallet and his phone from his pockets and runs into the water , which is waist high , wearing all of his clothes			2
the water is waist - deep as the man makes a desperate dash to save his camera before it meets a watery ending but with the camera dropping , he just manages to grab it in the nick of time the footage then shows how the camera is continuing to drop but the man manages to grab the expensive piece of kit before it meets a watery end			1
he then appears to switch the gadget off before one of the children nearby shout to warn him that his wallet , which he took out of his wallet appears to be floating in the water			0
