by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:01 am on 10th november 2011 @entity3 prime minister @entity2 stepped down tonight without naming his successor as the nation lurched closer towards economic disaster			1
parties from left and right seemed to have settled on veteran socialist @entity9 , the speaker of parliament , after ditching a plan to recruit a former top @entity13 official			0
but talks have hit a last - minute snag , with political leaders leaving a top - level meeting without naming a new pm			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity2 has officially stood down but there is no word yet on who will succeed him mr @entity21 leaves the presidential palace after quitting over the crisis greeks and the nation 's international lenders have watched in growing horror for three days as party leaders feuded over a shrinking list of credible candidates to lead a national unity coalition after @entity2 's government imploded			1
the president 's office said the talks , which have already lasted three days , would resume tomorrow morning			2
earlier , @entity35 , the head of a small right - wing party , had stormed out of the meeting , accusing the heads of the two main parties of using ' trickery ' but not giving any details			2
farcically , the breakdown in talks came less than hour after mr @entity2 said in his televised resignation speech agreement had been reached			1
they need to form a unified secure a new 130 billion euro ( Â£ 111.5 billion ) debt deal from the eurozone and keep the country in the single currency			2
@entity3 will run out of money next month unless the new government comes to an agreement with the @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity3 's last remaining lenders			2
in a television address before heading to meet the president , @entity2 wished the new prime minister well without giving any name and declared that @entity3 had avoided bankruptcy - even though @entity3 are pulling their savings out of local banks due to the political turmoil			1
speaker @entity9 was expected to take over as prime ministers but there were problems in discussions today savers have been pulling huge sums of money from their bank accounts in case the country reverts back to the drachma they withdrew as much as 5 billion euros - nearly 3 percent of total deposits - after @entity2 's shock call last week for a referendum on the euro zone bailout , said one banker , who declined to be named			1
' many people withdrew their money from banks on thursday and friday and money couriers had a hard time supplying banks with cash to satisfy the emergency demand , ' said another banking source , who also requested anonymity			0
many wealthy @entity3 moved their money into foreign banks last year as the crisis deepened			0
now other people are demanding sometimes large amounts in euro banknotes , fearing that any bank savings might be converted into devalued new drachma if @entity3 is forced to revert to its national currency			0
' we got to the point where customers ordered amounts of up to 600,000 to 700,000 euros in cash to take home - unbelievable , ' the first banker said			2
@entity2 also said the new government would win approval for @entity3 's 130 billion euro bailout deal and secure the nation 's membership of the euro zone despite its crisis			1
' i am proud that , despite the difficulties , we avoided bankruptcy and ensured the country stayed on its feet , ' he said			2
' i want to wish the new prime minister success , i will support the new effort with all my strength			0
' today , despite our differences - political and social differences do exist - we have put aside our fruitless conflict and disagreement , ' @entity2 said			1
right - wing party ( @entity125 ) leader @entity124 stormed out of talks at the @entity3 @entity127 today it was left to the party sources to give @entity3 some idea of who their leader will be until early elections are held in february			1
they named speaker @entity9 , 60 , who founded the @entity135 party in 1974 along with @entity2 's late father @entity136 , @entity3 's first socialist prime minister			1
however , they warned against taking anything for granted			0
' we have agreed on @entity142 but things can change between now and when the prime minister sees the president , ' a source close to the discussions between @entity135 and the conservative opposition @entity140 told @entity146 on condition of anonymity			0
earlier optimistic reports proved premature as the parties bickered over who should take the poisoned chalice and lead a government that will impose yet more crippling financial austerity on an angry electorate			0
some @entity3 had put their faith in a plan for @entity158 , a former vice-president of the @entity13 , to head the new government as a technocrat and give it the credibility that politicians lost long ago			0
but that idea stalled in the small hours , apparently over politicians ' refusal to let @entity158 pick his own team to tackle @entity3 's overwhelming debt and budget problems			0
with @entity3 and the @entity53 clamouring for an end to the game of political cat - and - mouse , the @entity171 governor earlier made a rare intervention to say a new coalition was imperative for securing the euro zone bailout			1
' political uncertainty has added to the stress facing the economy and the banking system , ' @entity179 governor @entity178 said in a statement			0
' any delay in forming a new government threatens to damage further the country 's credibility			0

@entity2 officially steps down
