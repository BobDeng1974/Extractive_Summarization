although i 'm a beauty lover first and foremost , i also adore my fashion			0
some of you may be aware i actually have my own clothing collection with @entity4			1
i 'm particularly proud of my latest collection – there 's an array of pieces to suit different body shapes , styles and occasions , from glam gowns to more comfortable , casual pieces which are perfect for everyday wear			1
i recently did a shoot to showcase the collection			1
i did n't want to go too overboard with my make - up so as not to detract attention from the pieces themselves , so opted for a sleek graphic eye line paired with a summery pop of colour on the lips			1
the light diffusing particles in this luxurious primer help correct uneven complexions and provide skin with an illuminated glow			0
i followed this up by applying @entity44 , the medium coverage formula disguises blemishes like a dream while still offering a fresh - faced finish			0
living up to its name , this foundation wo n't budge all day if topped with the right powder , making it my ideal choice for photoshoots or a night out			2
to set this in place , i brushed a light dusting of @entity57 and @entity58 across my face			0
@entity27 wanted her make - up to be quite subtle so as not to detract from her clothes @entity62 and @entity63 next onto contouring : i used the @entity65 and @entity66 to chisel my cheekbones and give my skin a gorgeous shimmery glow			1
@entity70 i opted for a simple yet sexy feline flick on the eyes using the @entity73			2
liquid eyeliner can be tricky to apply , but i find the easiest method to be shutting your eye and stretching out the lid with a finger			0
@entity27 opted for a simple yet sexy cat eye flick and paired it with a muted pink lip to keep her look suitable for day wear gently dot the eyeliner across the upper lash line , slightly flicking it out towards the outer corner			1
once you have your basic shape , build the line up slowly and extend the flick to your preferred size			0
make sure you work the eyeliner right into your lash line for a clean , sleek result			2
i wore individual false eyelashes on the shoot to accentuate my peepers , but if you do n't have any to hand , apply generous lashings of @entity100 mascara to give your lashes a similar voluminous flutter			2
@entity27 recommends applying a translucent powder to ensure your make - up stays put @entity105 finally , i slicked a coat of @entity107 in @entity108 – a gorgeous coral pink tone – over my lips			1
the creamy yet super long - lasting formula is perfect for occasions where you want your lippy to last without drying out your pout , and the vivid hue complements the simple graphic eye line beautifully			0
et voila ! a simple and sexy look that works equally well for work or play			0
you can get all the products i wore on the shoot from @entity124			0
to check out my full collection head to @entity126 lots of love , @entity27 xxx			1
