blaming the @entity7 for the crisis , miss @entity39 said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the @entity47			2

lord @entity2 , who has had business dealings in @entity4 , questioned ' the manner in which the @entity4 police and other authorities are carrying out their job '			0
he asked @entity58 minister @entity57 if he thinks the @entity4 ' are really interested in the problem '			1
lord @entity2 added : ' my experience of dealing with the @entity4 in the commercial world , with the greatest respect , is that they think , ' it is not our problem '			0
' one wonders whether they want to get rid of these people as quickly as possible			0
lord @entity57 said : ' we have @entity80 people on the ground augmenting the work done by the port - side authorities ' ' in addition , we have sniffer dogs on the port side , as well as the fencing which we are introducing			2
that co-operation is there ; we should like it to be extended			0
' there are up to 2,500 illegal immigrants camped in the @entity4 port trying to reach @entity7 , with many clambering into lorries to cross the channel earlier this month @entity100 revealed @entity7 has just five scanners to detect stowaways trying to enter the country in lorries through our 29 ports			1
the @entity80 budget also fell by 20 per cent last year , raising fears about the ability to detect attempts by foreigners to smuggle themselves across the @entity47 in cars , trucks and trailers			0

lord @entity57 said the problem was only likely to get worse and warned both lorry and car drivers to be on their guard			1
former commissioner of the metropolitan police @entity130 questioned what the ' major impediment ' was to coming up with a solution to the problem			0
lord @entity57 told him : ' the very simple tasks of actually securing the vehicle and ensuring that it is padlocked - if that happened the problem would be reduced dramatically from what it is			0

' the reality is that in terms of domestic tourists and other travellers there they should really be aware that this is a major problem - it is only to get worse and they have to take the same level of security to protect their vehicles as well , ' he said			0
@entity181 former cabinet minister @entity180 asked : ' why do these people arrive here ? surely they have been in @entity4 ? are they fleeing from persecution in @entity4 ? ' what 's wrong with the @entity4 state that it does n't accept its obligations to look after such people ? ' lord @entity57 said a fall in unemployment and growth in the economy in the @entity7 , which was the ' opposite ' to @entity4 , was acting as a ' pull factor into this country ' .			1
