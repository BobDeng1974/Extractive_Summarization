by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 20:10 est , 28 march 2012 ten years of patience and star - gazing by astronomers has finally culminated in this incredible image showcasing around one billion stars in the @entity6			0
it was produced by scientists who combined infra - red light images from two telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres			1
astronomers from the @entity13 and @entity14 gathered the data which was then processed and archived by teams at the universities of @entity18 and @entity19			2
star - filled sky : this incredible image , shows in detail , the star forming area in the @entity6			0
scientists produced the picture by combining infra - red light images from two telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres they have now made it available to studies around the world and hope it will change the way scientists carry out future research			1
dr @entity34 , of the @entity18 's school of physics and astronomy , said : ' this incredible image gives us a new perspective of our galaxy and illustrates the far - reaching discoveries we can make from large sky surveys			0
' having data processed , archived and published by dedicated teams leaves other scientists free to concentrate on using the data and is a very cost - effective way to do astronomy			2
' dr @entity34 said the archived information on the billions of stars , known as the @entity52 , will allow scientists to carry out research in future without needing to generate further data			1
zoomed out : astronomers from the @entity13 and @entity14 gathered the data which was then processed and archived by teams at the universities of @entity18 and @entity19 who , in turn , have made it available to studies around the world as well as being published online the image is being presented at the @entity65 in @entity66 today and shows the plane of the @entity6 galaxy from @entity70 's perspective			0
it combines data from the @entity73 in @entity74 and the @entity52 telescope in @entity14			2
astronomers used infra - red radiation instead of visible light to enable them to see through much of the dust in the @entity6 and record details of the centre of the galaxy			1
the work was supported by government body the @entity85 .			0
