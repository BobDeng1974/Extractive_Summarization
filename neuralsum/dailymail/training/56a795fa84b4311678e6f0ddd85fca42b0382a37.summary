a study of 8,000 men has found that those of a lesser height lived longer than their taller peers – with those below 5ft 2in living longest			1
they do n't fit with the ' tall , dark and handsome ' ideal supposedly favoured by women			0
but there is some good news for shorter men - as when it comes to longevity , they just might measure up best the research , conducted by @entity21 scientists , suggested short stature may be related to a gene that is linked to longevity			1
a protective form of the gene , called @entity27 , leads to smaller body size during early development but is also likely to mean a longer life span			1
@entity31 men were also more likely to have lower blood insulin levels , and were less likely to have cancer in their lifetime			1
professor @entity35 , of the @entity36 , said : ‘ ' we split people into two groups - those that were 5 - foot - 2 and shorter , and 5 - 4 and taller			2
' the folks that were 5 - 2 and shorter lived the longest			2
the range was seen all the way across from being 5 - foot tall to 6 - foot tall			0
the taller you got , the shorter you lived			2
' the study , published in the journal @entity48 , tracked more than 8,000 @entity21 men of @entity51 ancestry born between the years 1900 and 1919			1
the lifestyles and health conditions of these men were closely followed and studied by the researchers through the years			2
shorter men were also more likely to have lower blood insulin levels , and were less likely to have cancer in their lifetime , the study found professor @entity61 said the findings are not absolute , but do provide a strong link between height and longevity			1
' no matter how tall you are , you can still live a healthy lifestyle , ' he said			0
but he added : ' this study shows for the first time that body size is linked to the @entity27 gene			1
' we knew that in animal models of aging			0
we did not know that in humans			0
we have the same or a slightly different version in mice , roundworms , flies , even yeast has a version of this gene , and it 's important in longevity across all these species			2
' around 1,200 men from the study lived into their 90s and 100s , and approximately 250 of those men are still alive today			1
a separate study , published in 2012 , had similar results			0
that research , which tracked men on the @entity96 island of @entity97 , found that shorter men lived for two years longer than their taller counterparts			1
it tracked 500 males born between 1866 and 1915			0
smaller mice , rats , ponies and monkeys generally live longer			0
the smaller @entity107 elephant also lives longer than the larger @entity109 elephant .			0

study of 8,000 men shows short men lived longer than their taller peers
scientists found short stature may be related to gene linked to longevity
@entity31 men more have lower blood insulin , and less likely to have cancer
