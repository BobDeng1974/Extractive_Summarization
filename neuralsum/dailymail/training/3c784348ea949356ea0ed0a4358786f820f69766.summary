@entity8 , a @entity9 struggling to keep her @entity11 seat in a year when republicans have captured most of the political momentum , let @entity2 @entity14 house speaker @entity14 have the entire hour to himself , taking questions from two moderators			1
' this is more of a conversation with speaker @entity14 , as opposed to a debate , ' remarked @entity20 , a @entity21 anchor tapped to anchor the event			1
the race is a virtual dead heat , with @entity8 polling 2 percentage points ahead – a razor - thin lead that 's inside the margin of error			1
@entity2 house speaker @entity14 got an unfiltered hour of ' debate ' time to himself on tuesday when senator @entity8 refused to show up embattled : sen. @entity8 is dogged by new allegations that her husband 's company got $ 387,000 from the 2009 @entity36 stimulus bill – which she voted for @entity8 's decision to ditch the debate was a political calculation that seemed to backfire ' i 'm disappointed that senator @entity8 's not here , ' @entity14 said in his closing statement , ' particularly because just two days from now @entity2 voters are going to go cast their ballots in early voting			1
' the episode brought conservative partisans out of the woodwork on @entity51 , with many comparing @entity8 's empty chair to another , more famous one			2
at the @entity55 , film star @entity54 set up an empty chair representing president @entity36 and carried on an imaginary conversation with it – complete with pregnant pauses – in front of a nationwide prime - time audience			2
' what do you want me to tell @entity64 ? ' he asked the chair , referring to @entity64 , the president 's @entity66 opponent			0
' i ca n't tell him to do that to himself , ' @entity54 said , after allowing a few seconds for the invisible @entity36 to talk to him			0
' you 're crazy , you 're absolutely crazy , ' he said			0
' you 're getting as bad as @entity70			0
' @entity14 , too , made his hour - long messaging monopoly about the president			2
' if you want to change president @entity36 's policies , you have to change your senator , ' he said			0
@entity14 has hit the president hard for his 2009 stimulus package , now that @entity8 stands accused of benefiting from her ' yes ' vote to pass it			1
her husband 's company received more than $ 387,000 in government handouts and tax credits under the program 's renewable energy provisions			1
@entity14 ' latest staetwide ad includes a narrator recounting the history			0
' days after @entity8 took office , she pushed @entity36 's stimulus bill , ' the voice says before cutting to a clip of @entity8 saying the infusion of cash would help the country 's economy move forward			1
' it did n't , ' he says			0
' but it did help @entity8 move forward personally			0
' @entity54 talked to an empty chair – representing president @entity36 – during the @entity55 in @entity101 , @entity102 some on @entity51 quickly remembered the last time a political audience was treated to the sight of an empty chair @entity108 commentator and liberal firebrand @entity107 castigated the @entity8 campaign for giving the @entity66 challenger an unfiltered approach to voters			1
' the moderator explained that @entity14 ' answers would n't be timed – they were otherwise planning on timing them – because nobody else needed to talk ! ' she exclaimed			0
' so for you , voters , we present this hour - long conversation with just the @entity66 candidate			2
uncontested , ' @entity107 continued in disbelief , “ so he can tell you what he thinks without any time constraints and without anybody rudely interrupting			0
' ' did i mention this race is basically tied ? i did mention that			0
' @entity8 's campaign team busied itself during the debate sending journalists a steady stream of emails contesting @entity14 ' points as he made them – a tactic that fell flat as reporters wondered why the candidate did n't participate and make her points in person			1
' @entity8 declined to attend tonight 's debate , ' a @entity145 reporter tweeted			2
' yet so many fact - checks in my inbox			0
' the @entity2 race is on pace to become the most expensive @entity11 contest ever mounted , costing the two sides and their surrogate groups an estimated $ 100 million in ad buys and other costs .			1

@entity2 @entity158 sen. @entity8 skipped the tuesday debate , giving @entity66 state house speaker @entity14 a free hour of tv time
@entity8 's campaign team filled reporters ' in - boxes with rapid - response emails during the ' debate ' even though she was n't there
she 's under *pressure* after it was *revealed* that her husband 's business got more than $ 387,000 in government funds from the 2009 @entity36 stimulus
@entity2 race is tightening and could be a *pickup* for republicans as they try to take over the @entity11 and control all of @entity180
