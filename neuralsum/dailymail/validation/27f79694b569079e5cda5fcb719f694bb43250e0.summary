a 42 - year - old man rushed to hospital after fracturing his penis during sex			2
after accidentally hitting his erect penis on his partner 's perineum , he heard a loud snap , saw a spurt of blood and felt searing pain ( file picture ) doctors found he had torn his tunica albuginea , the watertight and fibrous outer sheath of one of the penis ' inner chambers , the corpus cavernosa			1
the corpus cavernosa runs along the length of the penis and is filled with spongy tissue , into which blood flows to create an erection			1

it is a whitish and fibrous membrane			0
the snap had led to a tear in the corpus cavernosa ’s sheath , which meant blood leaked out , creating swelling			2
it was forced out of his body through the urethra , the tube by which a man passes urine , which is why he saw blood coming out of the end of his penis			2
when he arrived at hospital , he was taken straight to the operating room for emergency repair			0
doctors said the consequences of such a fracture include erectile dysfunction , as scar tissue known as fibrous plaques can form in the penis , meaning they warned it is also possible to suffer a curve or bend in the penis , and damage to the nerves in the genitals			0
fortunately , the man , who was seen three and six months after surgery , regained his ability to obtain an erection - without any noticeable curvature or plaque forming in his penis			1
the news comes after @entity114 reported on the story of @entity116 , who endured a painful erection for several weeks			0
he has suffered a rare side effect to a sleeping tablet given to him in hospital			0
mr @entity116 was hospitalised for 10 days as doctors treated his prolonged erection			0
he developed fibrosis – where the arteries and muscles in the penis becoming hardened with fibrous tissue – as a result of the continued erection			0
he claims this has left him impotent and with difficulty urinating - and is suing the hospital for not making the side effects of the sleeping tablets clear to him .			0
