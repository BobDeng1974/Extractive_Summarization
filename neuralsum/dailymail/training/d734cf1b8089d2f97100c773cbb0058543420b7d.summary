by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 04:30 est , 27 july 2012 callous : @entity1 looked unrepentant at @entity2 today , where he was jailed for animal cruelty a cannabis - smoking dog owner who killed his pet by throwing it out of a tenth floor window to ' teach it a lesson ' has been jailed			1
sick @entity1 , pictured , launched eight - year - old @entity11 out of his flat window in @entity2 , @entity13 , after the @entity15 bull terrier relieved itself on his carpet			1
the innocent dog suffered multiple injuries and died as a result of extensive internal bleeding following the tragic incident on january 18 this year			2
@entity1 made a rude gesture at the cameras as he arrived at @entity24 today , wearing a short - sleeved white shirt and looked emotionless as lead magistrate @entity26 sentenced him to four months in prison			1
the court heard how callous @entity1 tied up his dog in the bathroom of his flat for four hours after it had misbehaved			1
when he returned to untie the dog at around 3am he found it had weed on the carpet			1
he flew into a blind rage and attacked the dog before throwing it from the tenth - floor window			1
@entity1 called the police after launching his dog from the window and stunned officers by confessing to the sickening assault			1
in police interview he told shocked officers : ' it was a really good shot - i launched him by the scruff of his neck and he bounced off the window and went down			0
' maybe i was just out of my depth with this dog			1
' usually i ’m really good with animals - i do n’t drown kittens or salt slugs			0
' i got carried away and angry at the time			0
long way to fall : @entity1 launched the dog out of his flat window at 3am , having left it tied up for four hours after smoking a cannabis joint ' i do n’t know what came over me - it must be some kind of evil in this world			1
' @entity1 admitted to police he had smoked a two - inch cannabis joint on the evening of the attack but said he still completely understood that what he was doing would kill his pet			1
he told bemused officers : ' i was trying to teach it a lesson '			0
the heartless thug even tried to escape charges by claiming he had attacked the dog in self - defence after it had bitten him on the foot			2
police could not find any evidence the dog had attacked @entity1			1
@entity1 - who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was sectioned following the sickening attack - pleaded guilty to three charges of animal cruelty when he appeared at the same court in may			1
2012 @entity84 , defending , described the situation as ' tragic ' but called on magistrates to consider a suspended jail sentence due to his client ’s early guilty plea			0
he said : ' this is a matter which will undoubtedly provoke public outrage			0
' my client has put forward no attempt to excuse his behaviour and accepts what he has done was an evil thing to do			0
' magistrates refused to accept @entity1 ’s defence and handed him the maximum sentence available for an animal cruelty offence			2
lead magistrate @entity26 said : ' this is a horrendous incident which caused the death of a dog			2
' there is no evidence this was caused by your mental illness and must be dealt with on the merits of the case			0
' he sentenced @entity1 to the maximum six months ' imprisonment - reduced by two months in recognition of his early guilty plea			2
@entity1 was ordered to pay £ 500 costs to the @entity116 and was disqualified from owning or keeping a pet for life			2
outside court , @entity116 inspector @entity119 welcomed the prison sentence but called for tougher sentencing for animal cruelty offences			0
he said : ' i hope this sentence acts as a strong deterrent to show that any cruelty to animals will not be tolerated			0

' it would be appreciated if the sentences made available to magistrates for these offences were harsher			0
