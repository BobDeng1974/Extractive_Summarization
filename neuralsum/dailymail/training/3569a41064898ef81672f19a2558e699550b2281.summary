by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:33 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 8 october 2012 these are the haunting shoebox - sized rooms inspired an artist ’s childhood exploring the bombed out homes of the @entity8			1
using scenes just 12 inches high photographer @entity9 has created magical apocalyptic - like scenes of nature reclaiming living rooms			1
@entity9 , 60 , from @entity14 , can take 15 to 20 hours making a single scene using everything from dolls house furniture to using sprigs of herbs like thyme			2
haunting reminders : the shoebox - sized rooms inspired by artist @entity9 's childhood exploring the bombed - out homes of the @entity8 apocalyptic : the scenes mess with scale , with a window and a chair dwarfing the perplexed man who has just arrived on the scene his work has already got the attention of art galleries seeing him exhibit across @entity14 and now he wants to share his work online with a downloadable ebook ‘ @entity39 and other places , @entity41 ’			1
made from day - to - day objects with dazzling effect , the dioramas cost just £ 5 to £ 6 to make but look immaculate even though same of the greenery is created from shredded carpet underlay			0
@entity9 admits he only rekindled a passion for photography in the last five years having worked most of his life in post-production on animations and films			0
@entity9 said despite the bleak seeming nature of his scenes , which he gets much of the material for from @entity56 , he is actually a cheery person			0
clever : @entity9 , pictured , can take 15 to 20 hours making a single scene using everything from dolls house furniture to using sprigs of herbs like thyme incredible : the scenes are just 12 inches high but contain incredible detail like this tree , chairs and table creative : miniature people walk across a damaged piano in this scene inspired : @entity9 says the art is linked to the bombed - out homes he played in in 1950s @entity75 he said : ' a lot of people look at them and think i must be so miserable but that could n’t be further from the truth			1
' i ’ve always had a fascination with the derelict and often tried to photograph it but i find that these scenes allow me to get across what i could n’t out in reality			0
' a lot of people think the windows in my pictures are like a window on the soul but it ’s more about a system of lighting the scene originally			0
painstaking : the photographer and artist puts in an incredible amount of detail into every scene he creates art : these images show the intricate work he puts in on every piece he creates recognised : @entity9 's work has already got the attention of art galleries seeing him exhibit across @entity14 hot : within this shattered and decrepit property a small and tidy beach is created in this scene ' i think there ’s a sense of anything could be going on the other side of that window but inside the room there ’s a different world			1
' @entity9 said a lot of the inspiration for his work came from dreams he ’d had from his childhood			2
he said : ' during the 50s as a child we would play in bombed - out houses from the @entity8 in @entity75 , there is something of those houses in my work			2
' juxtapose : the stark run down contrasts brilliantly with the colourful scene at its centre			0

@entity9 's scenes take 20 hours each and are only inches high - but have incredible detail
the rooms and houses he recreate are inspired by his childhood in @entity75 where he would wander through bombed - out houses
he mixes this with his dreams to make unbelievable art
