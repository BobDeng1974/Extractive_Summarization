international stars like @entity1 will visit to play @entity3 cricket this summer , but talk among homegrown players is of how it might save @entity6 from further embarrassment in global competitions			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , two foot soldiers in the recent @entity13 fiasco , both called for some rethinking of the domestic structure to avoid a repeat of what happened in @entity19 and @entity20			1
at the launch of next month 's opening of the @entity23 's @entity9 admitted : ' as a team we 're not hiding behind the fact that we 're embarrassed about what happened			1
with the quality of the squad that we had there 's no excuse not to make it out of the group stages			2
' @entity9 believes @entity6 's players are n't competing in enough @entity3 competitions @entity9 was at @entity36 on thursday at the launch of this season 's t20 domestic competition both he and @entity10 feel that a way of improving @entity6 's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like @entity19 and @entity44 with their franchise systems			1
' the @entity46 is fantastic , i 've played in it for three years and really enjoyed it , ' said @entity9			1
' i 'm a big fan of the block system for @entity3 , you dedicate three weeks to a month to hone your skills , all your focus if on @entity3			0
in the last couple of years in @entity6 i have n't had much of a chance to develop			1
' over here you play something different sunday to wednesday , then @entity3 on friday so you do n't get a huge chance to practice your skills			0
over there they have less teams so the standard is fantastic			0
' i think that 's maybe where we got found out a bit in the @entity13 , not many guys get exposed to @entity3			1
there 's such a heavy schedule of @entity67 matches guys do n't get a chance to play domestic @entity3			1
look at guys like @entity72 and @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , they do n't get a chance to play for their counties			0
' it does n't help that a lot of our guys do n't play in the @entity82 or the @entity46			0
other players are constantly playing in front of big crowds and improving their skills and that 's not something we had in the @entity13			1
@entity6 were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50 - over @entity13 earlier this year , dumped out of their group @entity1 is adept at playing @entity3 all over the world and @entity9 wants more of that for @entity94 stars ' it 's tougher here with the indifferent weather and i do n't really know what goes on behind the scenes , but in terms of standard and quality i think the franchise system would work in @entity6			1
' at thursday 's @entity36 launch there were players from all 18 counties , but that number would be cut down if the @entity110 and its new management ever get round to introducing a more city - based league			1
@entity10 , who hopes to start bowling again in the next two weeks after recent foot problems , will play alongside @entity1 for a @entity117 team now styled as the @entity118			0
he believes the rebranding added to the support they received last season , and could so elsewhere if replicated : ' as a player you felt like there were more people behind you , ' he said			2
' it might attract more people to come to the ground from different areas of the city , they might feel more part of it			0
' i 'm sure if it happened it would n't feel right at first but i bet the @entity46 did n't feel right at first , everything moves forward and evolves			0
i think it would probably be a good thing			0
it would improve the standard of cricket , it might not feel right but eventually it would			2
' it 's a tricky one , you would have to get counties to merge			2
some players might benefit and others would n't			2
some people are going to be unhappy			0
i do n't think counties would be shut down but if franchises are going to happen something has to give			0
' advanced ticket sales are said to be up 41 per cent on last year ahead of the may 15 start with other overseas stars in action including @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 .			0

@entity6 suffered *humiliation* in the 50 - over @entity13 this year
@entity9 believes they would benefit from playing more t20 cricket
