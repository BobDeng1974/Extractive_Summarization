by @entity0 published : 20:59 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 28 february 2013 vegetarians have reacted with horror to plans by @entity5 ’s biggest crisp maker to start selling smoky bacon and roast chicken crisps that will contain meat for the first time			1
in what may be a surprise to many , neither of the varieties of crisps made by @entity13 contain real bacon or real chicken - but instead rely on artificial flavours			1
the move to real ingredients is thought to be an attempt to shake off the ‘ junk food ’ label - but has been greeted with horror by vegetarians who have been tucking into the snacks for years			1
change : @entity13 plans to start selling smoky bacon ( left ) and roast chicken ( right ) crisps that will contain meat earlier this month @entity13 - part of international food giant @entity28 - tipped off the @entity30 that within weeks their previously meat - free flavours ‘ will now contain extracts of meat			1
’ the news has sparked controversy among vegetarians who can no longer enjoy their favourite flavour crisps and are urging the company to reconsider			2
in an online forum one wrote : ‘ whether this is simply a publicity stunt planned by the marketing department to cause public outcry , or whether @entity13 think this change in ingredients will increase their profits , i will certainly be contacting them to let them know how i feel , and urge you to do the same			1
’ another also encouraged fellow veggie consumers to revolt , they wrote : ‘ the more people that e-mail them , the more likely they will be to reconsider the new ingredients			2
’ flavouring : the change will now be promoted by former @entity56 footballer and presenter @entity55 next month			1
he is pictured here in 1998 with model @entity59 the row has caused @entity13 customer services to wade in to try re-assure vegetarians that their products will continue to be ethical			1
in a letter to one complainant they said : ‘ i am really sorry that you will no longer be able to enjoy @entity13 roast chicken and smokey bacon flavoured crisps			1
‘ i can understand your concerns over this matter however ; we are using only free - range chicken and freedom food pork to ensure the highest standard of animal welfare			0
’ @entity80 including cheese from @entity82 definitively @entity83 with @entity84 of @entity86 tomatoes classically ready salted with salt from @entity88 @entity89 with real @entity5 vinegar undeniably @entity91 with real @entity5 vinegar @entity92 with sour cream from @entity94 tantalisingly @entity95 with @entity84 of @entity86 tomatoes famously @entity96 blended in @entity5 @entity98 bacon with @entity100 pork roast chicken with free - range chicken the change will now be promoted by former @entity56 footballer and presenter @entity55 next month			1
in other changes , the firm is to use cheese from @entity82 and the salt and vinegar flavour will have real @entity5 vinegar			2
packets of sour cream and chive crisps with sour cream from @entity94 have already been slipped onto shelves as part of a trial by the @entity120 - based firm			0
in 2007 , @entity123 snack food company @entity121 was forced to abandon a move to use animal rennet in its @entity121 bars bars after it was bombarded with complaints from vegetarians			2
walkers could not be contacted for comment last night			0
last year @entity13 was slammed by customers who counted as few as five whole crisps in a packet of their newest brand , @entity135			2
things got so bad that the @entity138 ’s watchdog programme launched an investigation after receiving a number of complaints about the pitiful amount of crisps in the multipack bags			0
their investigation found a maximum of 13 crisps in bag and a minimum of 11			0
but other consumers also contacted the show to report that they had seen as few as five crisps in their multipack bags			0
walkers were quick to hit back at the criticism claiming that their deep ridged crisps were more prone to breakage and were protected by being sold in slightly bigger packets – giving the false impression that there were less crisps in them			0
but that did n’t stop angry customers taking to twitter to voice their frustration			0
