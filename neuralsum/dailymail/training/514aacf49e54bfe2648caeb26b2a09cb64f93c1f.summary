the celestial spectacle , known as a ' ring of fire ' eclipse , is the second solar eclipse visible from northern @entity12 in six months			1

symphony of the spheres : the moon crosses in front of the sun as seen from the @entity27 this combination of six photos shows the moon crossing in front of the sun ( clockwise from top left ) the moon moved across the sun for just a few minutes , giveing @entity33 these astonishing pictures friday 's eclipse , also called an annular solar eclipse , is not considered as scientifically important or dramatic as november 's , because the moon is too far from @entity4 - and therefore appears too small - to completely black out the sun. unlike a total solar eclipse , which essentially turns day into night , an annular eclipse just dims the sunlight			0
' a total eclipse is overall far more spectacular , far more emotional , ' said @entity43 , an astronomer at @entity27			0
still , he said , the eclipse ' will give you a nice ring of sunlight in the sky - it will be quite different '			2

the spectacle seen at a beach in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( right ) a partial solar eclipse occurs when the @entity68 passes between the @entity4 and the @entity69 stars hide your fires : the clouds can not hide the majesty of the eclipse in @entity66 the shadow drifted across @entity77 , the @entity78 and the tiny island nation of @entity80 at remote outposts across @entity12 , scientists and spectators gathered to watch as the eclipse began casting its approximately 120 - mile - wide shadow at dawn over @entity12 , before moving east through the @entity87 and the top of @entity90 state			1
the shadow was drifting across @entity77 , the @entity78 and the tiny island nation of @entity80 , and will eventually end in a largely uninhabited area of the @entity92			2
the eclipse lasted between three and six minutes , depending on its location , and blacked out around 95 per cent of the sun at its peak			0
a partial eclipse was visible to people in other parts of @entity12 , @entity66 , @entity100 and the @entity101			1

amateur astronomers clicked away on cameras and local high school students measured the drop in temperature as the moon moved in front of the sun and blocked out much of the light			0
the moment , @entity109 said , was magical			0

skygazers : an astronomer said : ' the color of the light changes in an eerie fashion , and you sense that something very strange and weird and wonderful is going on ' in november , another solar eclipse plunged the country 's northeast into darkness twilight : the sunlight was dimmed by the partial eclipse , but did not plunge the area into darkness like a total eclipse does			1

the partial eclipse *created* a *shimmering* circle of light in the sky
it is the second of its type to hit @entity12 in six months
it drifted across @entity12 before moving out over @entity92
