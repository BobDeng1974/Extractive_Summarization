they had earned a trophy and a promising title shot , but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by @entity5 on saturday night			1
wastefulness is no cause for euphoria			0
the @entity9 had been retained , but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt , despite considerable @entity15 tenacity and occasional artistry			1
@entity17 , his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at @entity22 will not suffice against the leading rugby nations			1
@entity5 beat @entity24 but they have n't shown enough to convince yet during the @entity25 defeating @entity24 earned @entity26 and his men a trophy , but they did n't do enough the @entity5 squad smile for the cameras having defeated @entity24 25 - 13 to win the @entity9 1st minute : @entity31 sends @entity32 clear but he ignores @entity33 in space on the right and the door slams shut			1
13th minute : @entity38 frees @entity39 but the full - back — minus a boot — is chased down by @entity42 close to the posts			0
15th minute : the pack drive a scrum towards the @entity15 line but @entity47 is unable to pick up and touch down			1
17th minute : @entity49 storms clear with two team - mates on either side but goes it alone , slips and can not offload the ball			2
31st minute : @entity32 bursts through and sends @entity33 scorching to the line , but the ‘ try ’ is ruled out ny @entity56 for a forward pass			2
54th minute : rampant @entity5 swarm into the visitors ’ 22 but the attempted offload by @entity62 is pinched by @entity63			1
56th minute : replacement hooker @entity64 makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners			0
58th minute : @entity33 breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from @entity32 and can not release the centre to score			2
62nd minute : @entity39 blasts over the @entity15 22 to score , but the ‘ try ’ is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build - up — this time by @entity76			1
while the @entity77 is now planted at the top of the @entity25 table , even shambolic @entity80 may be no push - overs in the tournament finale at @entity22 next saturday if there is not a sharp up - turn in @entity85 precision			1
‘ if you look at the @entity87 , when they create a line break they usually end up scoring , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ we created 12 line breaks , which is a huge positive because i have n’t seen any team pull @entity24 apart like that , but to only come away with three tries is frustrating			1
i think the players know that			0
’ they most certainly do			0
@entity38 was named man of the match for his efforts at scrum half , but he appeared underwhelmed by the manner of the victory			0
‘ we got what we wanted in terms of the result , but the scoreline should have been better , ’ he admitted			0
there is a recurring concern for @entity5			1
composure — or a lack of it			0
they mustered plenty in @entity116 to turn the tide against @entity118 , but too often in tight games there are failures of decision - making or execution			0
the tone was set on saturday by @entity32 , who did n’t manage to pass to the unmarked @entity33 on the @entity15 22			1
put him in a @entity126 shirt and the centre would surely make the pass and create the try			0
yet , on this high - profile occasion , the chance was squandered			0
a similar error of judgment by @entity134 against @entity135 cost the @entity137 wing his place in the match - day squad , but @entity32 is likely to escape the same fate due to the absence of injured @entity142 and reservations about @entity144			0
@entity31 got @entity5 off to a perfect start in the second - half but the first half will have worried them @entity149 wing @entity49 crosses over to score @entity5 's third try and send them top of the @entity25 table the @entity154 player was not the sole offender , with @entity49 at fault for ignoring support more than once			1
it may seem churlish to criticise the @entity149 wing , who was dynamic and dangerous , but @entity5 urgently need a clinical edge			1
‘ it ’s that composure after the line break , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ it was good on some occasions because we scored three good tries , but there were also missing elements and we need to fix those for next week			1
’ @entity171 continued his purple patch by touching down for the fourth time in as many games			0
but he was left irritated by the hosts ’ profligate streak , too			0
‘ we made costly errors in the red zone in their 22 which let them off the hook , ’ said the @entity177 centre			0
‘ we are creating those opportunities , now it ’s just a matter of finishing them			0
’ @entity5 must not over-state their satisfaction at mere creation alone			1
on the one hand , @entity118 ’ victory over @entity189 was a source of great @entity85 joy , as it leaves @entity194 ’s team with it all in their favour in the three - way tussle for the championship title			2
but with the bigger picture in mind , the red - shirted defensive heroism in @entity116 rammed home the need for @entity5 to become more ruthless			2
on the latest evidence , their closest @entity204 rivals wo n’t be line - break fodder in the way @entity24 so often were			1
no other country can match the @entity87 ’ ability to expose and seize the jugular , but @entity194 will be painfully aware that his team can not rely on a torrent of attacking possession			2
when @entity5 are equalled or trumped up front — as was the case against @entity189 — they will require an executioner ’s instinct			2
at least it was evident in one man on saturday			2
@entity31 wielded the conductor ’s baton with staggering assurance for a 21 - year - old			0
he invariably took the right option while going through his wide - ranging repertoire in helping to conjure the tries by @entity171 and @entity49			0
he added one himself when the fractured @entity15 defence opened up in front of him			2
@entity64 ( centre ) leads an @entity5 breakaway as @entity194 's side returned to the @entity25 summit @entity33 runs clear but @entity5 repeatedly failed to take their chances at @entity22 on saturday @entity39 was one of the better performers but @entity5 spurned too many opportunities at @entity22 @entity38 hands off a tackle but the man of the match was n't happy with his team 's overall performance @entity171 , his club - mate at @entity177 , said : ‘ i have played with @entity31 since @entity243 and he has always been that kind of player who thrives under pressure and more or less always delivers			1
he has been outstanding for us in the @entity25			2
’ five days from now , @entity5 can win the title using their home advantage and the benefit of playing last and by preying on simmering @entity252 doubts			1
but if ‘ @entity254 ’ turns out to be a tense duel after all , they also need others to follow @entity257 ’s lead by finding the mental conviction to make the right calls			0
the wastefulness ca n’t go on , or next time there may not be a trophy to soften the inquest .			0

@entity5 top @entity25 table after win against @entity24 on saturday
but @entity17 wants his team to take their chances better
@entity5 created 12 line breaks , but only scored three tries against @entity15
@entity5 finish their campaign against @entity80 at @entity22 next week
