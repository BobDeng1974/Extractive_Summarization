@entity1 ’s ambassador to the @entity2 , @entity0 , said @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are playing by the rules on tax and should n't be demonised in @entity2 @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are playing by the rules on tax , are great @entity10 companies and should not be demonised in @entity2 , @entity1 ’s ambassador to the @entity2 said yesterday			1
@entity0 leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies , saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments			2
@entity19 warned in october that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying @entity2 taxes would be made to ‘ damn well pay ’			1
today the @entity23 will publish details of a new ‘ @entity3 tax ’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the @entity2 pay at least some tax here			1
but mr @entity0 told journalists in @entity29 it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘ international tax dodgers ’ despite the fact they pay little , if any , corporation tax in this country			1
‘ i ’m not the spokesman for any of those great @entity10 companies , ’ he said			0
‘ these companies and other companies … are clever about using international rules that exist , as written , by the way , by all of us – that ’s @entity10 government , @entity2 government – we make these rules and they are playing by them			2
‘ and i hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well			0
’ @entity48 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee which has exposed the extraordinary methods used by some corporations to avoid tax , condemned mr @entity0 ’s intervention as ‘ a joke ’			0
she said : ‘ they are not playing by the rules as any normal person would understand it – they are playing around with the rules in a way that is totally unethical			0
‘ playing by the rules means paying a fair amount of tax in the jurisdictions where you generate your revenues			0
these companies are not doing that , and to suggest they are somehow playing by the rules is a joke			0
’ today the @entity23 will publish details of a new ‘ @entity3 tax ’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the @entity2 pay at least some tax here : @entity3 , which generated more than £ 3.5billion from the @entity2 last year , paid just over £ 20million in corporation tax @entity4 is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the @entity2 for the last two years @entity4 is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the @entity2 for the last two years			1
@entity3 , which generated more than £ 3.5billion from the @entity2 last year , paid just over £ 20million in corporation tax			1
and @entity5 , which sold goods worth £ 4.3billion in the @entity2 last year , paid just £ 4.2million			1
the firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules			2
but their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the @entity2			0
chancellor @entity87 announced last week that the @entity2 will impose a new ‘ diverted profits tax ’ on corporations that seek to artificially shift their profits to low tax regimes abroad			2
he said it would raise £ 1billion over five years			0
but experts warn that the so - called ‘ @entity3 tax ’ , whose details will be unveiled today , could prove fiendishly difficult to enforce .			1
