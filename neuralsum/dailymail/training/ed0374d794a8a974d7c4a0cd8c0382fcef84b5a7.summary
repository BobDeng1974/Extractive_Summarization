for most dogs , @entity0 is the time to bundle around in festive wrapping paper , or sneak the last scraps of the turkey dinner from under the dining room table			1
but for these adorable canines and cats , @entity0 is yet another day spent waiting to be chosen by a loving family to be welcomed into a new home			1
more than 180 animals will spend today at the @entity12 's flagship centre in south west @entity13 , where they will be looked after by a team of volunteers			1
among the pets are those who have been rescued in the run - up to @entity0 , who will be treated to renditions of @entity47 and donated toys			1
but there are also those who will be spending their second @entity0 at the centre , after being rejected for adoption thousands of times over the past 12 months			1
@entity54 is one of those who will be manning the @entity57 home today			2
although she works as a rehomer in the cattery , she spends @entity0 playing @entity60 instead			1
ms @entity54 said : ' we 're full at the moment			0
there 's 83 pens in the cattery and they 've all got at least one cat in them			1
' a lot of people very kindly donated toys and treats for the cats , so we 've got a big pile of presents to give out to them ... we dish ' em all out so that there 's enough for every cat , and some left over			0
' ms @entity54 said the cats got into the @entity0 spirit early this year , with stockings outside each pen and the cattery being decked out in beautiful decorations which are ' much better than the dogs '			1
meanwhile , over in the kennels , canine welfare trainer @entity86 has been playing carols to keep her charges from fretting			0
she said : ' we 've got nice calm @entity0 songs going at the moment			1
@entity47 , stuff like that			2
' @entity86 , the canine welfare trainer , will be keeping honey , the @entity96 , company tpday @entity98 , a @entity99 ( left ) and @entity100 , a @entity101 , are two of the dogs looking for homes @entity104 , one of the rehomers , pictured with @entity106 , who has been waiting for a home for two months she was hoping for a white @entity0 this year , an added adventure for the mischievous animals			1
she said : ' it 's really nice to see how they respond to things like snow - some dogs are just mesmerised by it and do n't quite understand what they 're walking on			0
' others just go crazy for snow and have loads of fun charging around			0
it 's a nice time of year to be here , lots of different things , and everyone 's a bit more laid - back , ' she said			0
@entity127 @entity126 has one @entity0 present in mind			2
she has her fingers crossed that one of the ' long - stays ' will find a home these holidays - like @entity106 , who spends her nights in foster care but has been waiting patiently for a permanent home for more than two months			0
but @entity106 has nothing on @entity24 , in the home 's @entity140 branch in @entity28 , who has now spent more than half his life waiting for a home			1
@entity145 is a one - and - a - half - year - old @entity146 who has not yet tempted any prospective dog owners @entity148 , a @entity99 , is another of the ' long - stays ' who has been listening to @entity47 at the centre @entity153 the @entity152 does not have a permanent home			1
there is no time limit on how a dog or cat can spend at the centre the two - year - old mongrel arrived as a stray in february 2013 and has watched on as nearly 5,000 other dogs have found new homes			1
making a last - ditch pre-christmas plea this week , the @entity151 's manager @entity163 said : ' it 's unbelievable biscuit still has n't found a home when he 's such a beautiful and fun - loving dog who would fit in perfectly with a family			2
' every day we hope someone will call us wanting to meet him , but poor biscuit is constantly rejected and has n't had any interest			2
we really thought he 'd find a home before @entity0			1
' there is no time limit on how long a dog or cat can spend looking for a new home at @entity57 , but anything more than a few months is unusual			1
' we used to have dogs who stayed for a year , ' ms @entity126 said			0
' now , three or four months is a long stay for us			0
' intake co-ordinator @entity186 said he would be having ' more or less ' his first @entity0 off since he joined @entity57 14 years ago			2
@entity54 , pictured with one of the cats at the home , is one of those manning the @entity57 centre today five - month - old @entity192 needs a new home			2
the centre takes 1,300 calls per month regarding animals who need to be rehomed @entity197			2
the centre expects more animals to arrive in january , after @entity0 when a family decides they can no longer keep a pet at home , mr @entity186 is their first contact at the home			1
he deals with at least 1,300 calls a month and says they run the gamut from the heartbreaking to the slightly perplexing			0
' there have been cases where dogs have n't matched the sofa , things like that , they 've been different colours			2
that does happen as well			0
or it just does n't fit in with their lifestyle			0
' people do buy these things as fashion accessories , and it 's not , of course , ' he said			0
' for this time of year , some people are looking to rehome their animals because they 're going away for @entity0 - they 've got parties planned and they want to bring their animals in to the home			1
' come january or february , he will be bracing for another wave of puppies and kittens that were given as ill - advised gifts			0
' people do n't realise how much it 's actually going to cost to feed an animal , the time that 's involved ... like children , they have to be fed , kept clean , with fresh water and food and of course medical treatment as well , ' he said			0
but he is also expecting a surge of people to make the post-holiday decision to open their homes			0
cat rehomer ms @entity251 said she is expecting up to 40 cats to be snapped up this weekend alone			0
' most of our cats will fly out of here , ' she said .			0

handful of workers will spend @entity0 looking after the rescue animals
all 83 pens at the cattery will be home to at least one cat over festive period
another 100 dogs will spend day in centre after being rejected for adoption
some dogs have been returned because they do not match the family sofa
