she 's just days from giving birth but even impending motherhood could n't keep @entity3 away from her beloved horses			1
the @entity6 silver medallist was on hand to monitor her equine charges as they were put through their paces during the @entity12 point - to - point races in @entity13			2
the 32 - year - old , whose first child is due this month , was later spotted making her way through the paddock to a vantage point on the sidelines and watched intently as her runners flashed past			1
not long now : @entity3 makes her way through the paddock at the @entity23 ready to pop : the 32 - year - old royal is just days away from the birth of her first child wrapped in a cosy parka , complete with a fashionably furry hood , the fresh - faced mother - to - be appeared less than impressed with their performance but still managed to summon up a smile for the watching crowds			1
although rugby player husband @entity34 was nowhere to be seen , the royal was n't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme			0
@entity39 , who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer , had three horses entered for the event , among them , the hotly tipped @entity45 [ sic ] who appeared in the first race of the day			2
other entries included @entity48 , a six - year - old @entity50 bay , and @entity51 , a horse owned by her mother , @entity53			1
oh no ! miss @entity3 appeared less than impressed with the performance of her trio of horses fresh - faced : the mother - to - be was spotted enjoying a joke with friends from the sidelines cosy : mrs @entity62 and her one - year - old daughter @entity63 were both well wrapped up against the january chill and ms @entity3 was n't the only notable name to appear at the event			1
also watching the races was former @entity69 boss , @entity62			0
mrs @entity62 , who along with @entity70 has previously turned out to hunt with the @entity12 , was seen watching from the sidelines , her daughter @entity63 in her arms			0
despite looking pale , perhaps as a result of the ongoing phone - hacking trial , mrs @entity62 brightened up her look with a jaunty orange scarf , which she wore with a cosy padded jacket and a pair of tweed breeks			1
elegant : the @entity81 plumped for a chic turquoise ensemble but once again refused to accept posies while princess @entity53 was nowhere to be seen , despite having a horse entered in the races , another royal to brave the cold was the @entity81 , who was seen arriving at @entity89 church in @entity90 this morning for the sunday service			2
much to the surprise of onlookers , the @entity81 , who was colourfully dressed in a turquoise ensemble , once more refused to accept flowers from waiting children , and left the honours to a lady - in - waiting			0
by contrasts , the @entity99 was in fine fettle and beamed at well - wishers as he arrived at the village church on foot			0
with a new great grandson or daughter just days away , the @entity99 could have something else to smile about come next sunday			0
good spirits : the @entity99 was on fine form as he walked with members of the @entity113 not stopping : after the service , the @entity81 was driven away in a maroon @entity115 without collecting flowers			0

the 32 - year - old wore a cosy parka to the @entity23
three of her horses *competed* , including one owned by @entity53
just days away from her due date with her first child expected this month
