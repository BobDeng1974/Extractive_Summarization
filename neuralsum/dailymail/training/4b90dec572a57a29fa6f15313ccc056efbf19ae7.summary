the @entity0 is advertising for low - paid jobs , including three at @entity3 , the seat of archbishop of canterbury @entity5 the @entity0 has been accused of hypocrisy for demanding a minimum ' @entity8 ' of £ 7.85 , despite offering potential staff as little as £ 6.50 per hour			1
in an unprecedented intervention into the general election campaign last week , @entity0 leaders hit out at the ' burgeoning ' poverty of people in work and said it ' backed the concept of a @entity8			1
' the letter , which sparked a political row , also rallied against the market economy , consumerism , and the legacy of @entity23			0
but it has now emerged that a string of churches are advertising for jobs at the lowest possible legal minimum wage , which is currently £ 6.50			1
among those advertising for the low - paid jobs is @entity3 , the seat of the archbishop of canterbury @entity5 , which is recruiting two kiosk assistant vacancies for £ 6.70			1
the third low - paid job which has been advertised at @entity3 is for a kitchen porter , who would be paid £ 7.75 per hour			1
other cathedrals offering less than the @entity8 are @entity39 and @entity40			2
a source close to work and pensions secretary @entity41 told @entity42 : ' they should practise what they preach			1
it is hypocritical of them to admonish others when they do n't seem to be able to put their own house in order			0
' @entity51 mp @entity50 added : ' it 's astonishing that the @entity0 can call for the @entity8 to be paid by employers but do n't pay it themselves			1
' elsewhere in the @entity56 , a listing on the @entity39 diocese website says it is looking for a ' cook / chef ' who would work on a pro-rata salary of £ 11,830 - £ 13,650			2
if the person works the full 25 hours a week , they would be paid between £ 6.50 and £ 7.50 per hour			1
the cathedral is also advertising for waiting staff under a listing entitled ' @entity64 - @entity65 ( @entity66 ) '			1
the advert asks for candidates with previous waiting experience , who are willing to cover weekday , weekend and @entity73 shifts			0
meanwhile , an advert posted by the @entity75 is offering £ 7.65 to a pastoral worker at @entity77 - 20p less than the @entity8			1
the archbishop of @entity79 , @entity5 , said today : ' it 's embarrassing , of course , i wo n't say otherwise			1
' but in the light of transparency , which i welcome , i will say we are a complex institution and every parish church and cathedral is an independent charity , as is every diocese			0
' we do n't have a centralised method of control			0
i 'm not very keen on centralised control where , from far away , you tell people what to do			0
' among the adverts is one for kiosk assistants at @entity3 , who would be paid £ 6.70 per hour he said change to a living wage would come ' gradually ' , because each of the independent charities lacked the resources to move more quickly			1
he added : ' as charities they have to do that gradually			0
you 'll see that - and you 'll see the accusations of hypocrisy , but make up your own mind as to what it is			0
' a spokesman for the @entity0 said it had been ' at the forefront ' of campaigning for the @entity8			1
but she admitted that every parish , diocese and cathedral reaches its own decision on pay , because each is a separate legal entity			0
the spokesman added : ' the vast majority of those employed by or sub-contracted to the central institutions are already paid at least the @entity8 and all will be by april 2017			2
' @entity3 said that it is committed to introducing the @entity8 when ' economically feasible ' and said ' well over half ' of the staff were paid at least the @entity8			1
the letter from the @entity131 , published last week , was criticised as being a ' shopping list ' of left - wing demands , which led to ministers mocking the ' dwindling relevance ' of the @entity0 's bishops			1
they called for ' new direction ' in politics to replace a society that they said is self - interested , fragmented and badly led by politicians			0
referring to ' in - work poverty ' , the letter read : ' we have seen the burgeoning of in - work poverty - people can not earn enough to live decently			1
a job advert listed on the @entity150 website asks for experienced waiting stuff to work for national minimum wage another listing on the site asks for an experienced cook / chef who would be earning between £ 6.50 and £ 7.50 per hour ' this is why the @entity0 has backed the concept of the @entity8 - an agreement with employers to ensure that all their staff earn a modest hourly rate that is sufficient for a full time worker to live decently			1
' the @entity0 insisted that the letter was meant to counter the message – promoted by comedian @entity165 – that taking part in politics is useless			2
the bishops claimed their intention was not to tell people how to vote			0
but the ' letter to the people and parishes of the @entity0 ' suggested inequality and social injustice had increased under the @entity176			1
they said the burden of austerity has fallen on the poor and that worklessness is ' corrosive of human dignity and sense of identity '			0
the document , published in the name of the @entity0 's 51 - member @entity131 , called for continued membership of the @entity189 , a re-think of the nuclear deterrent , and the end of the first - past - the - post voting system			2
the bishops also declared that there has been ' an ugly undercurrent of racism in every debate about immigration ' and said that to cut the international aid budget would be ' globally irresponsible '			0
an advert posted by the @entity75 is offering £ 7.65 an hour to a pastoral worker at @entity77 the letter , entitled who is my neighbour ? , called for a new vision in politics to move the country on from the welfare state introduced by @entity211 after 1945 or @entity23 's drive to break the grip of the unions after 1979			2
it criticised the welfare state because voluntary efforts were ' marginalised ' and because ' dependence on state provision can undermine individual initiative and responsibility '			0
however , it directed its main fire at the market economy			0
meanwhile , a new study has found that half of workers in some parts of the country are earning less than the living wage			0
research for the @entity232 discovered that one in five jobs in @entity56 pays less than the £ 9.15 an hour in @entity235 and £ 7.85 elsewhere - well above the national minimum wage of £ 6.50			1
a source close to @entity41 said : ' they should practise what they preach ' in some areas , including parts of @entity243 , just over half of workers receive less than the living wage , rising to almost two thirds of women , said the report			2
in contrast , fewer than one in 10 workers in parts of @entity235 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 earn less than the living wage			0
@entity232 general secretary @entity257 said : ' extending the living wage is a vital step towards tackling the growing problem of in - work poverty across @entity56			2
' working families have experienced the biggest squeeze on their living standards since @entity266 times , and these living wage figures show that women are disproportionately affected			0
' pay has been squeezed at all levels below the boardroom , and the government 's mantra about ' making work pay ' is completely out of touch with reality			0
' shadow work and pensions secretary @entity277 said : ' the growth of low pay under @entity280 shows the @entity51 plan has failed millions of working families			2
a @entity284 spokesman said : ' the government is committed to improving living standards - particularly for the lowest paid through preventing exploitation , reducing taxes for the lowest paid and increasing employment			0
