a mother whose baby nearly died after he was born severely premature has urged other women to be aware of the infection that triggered her early labour			1
@entity5 , 42 , had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks			1
her son @entity8 was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive			1
in the weeks and months that followed , he underwent heart surgery , a lumbar puncture , laser eye surgery and 10 blood transfusions			0
mrs @entity5 , a marketing consultant from @entity17 , later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis ( bv )			1
his mother @entity26 was later told an infection she had , called bacterial vaginosis , was to blame			1
the condition can also cause miscarriage @entity21 affects one in three women , making it twice as common as thrush			1
it occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted , leading to an unpleasant odour			0
if untreated , it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting @entity38 such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia			1
pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely			0
one of the biggest problems is that @entity21 often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment , such as thrush			1
misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their gp , research has shown			0
many other women , such as mrs @entity5 , have simply never heard of the condition			1
she said : ' i was angry when i found out that @entity21 had caused @entity8 ’s premature birth because it was the first i had heard of it			1
' no - one ever told me the condition could lead to complications like this			0
' it was n't in any of the pregnancy books and was certainly never mentioned by midwives or doctors prior to it happening			0
' she said she noticed a discharge at around 24 weeks - but did n’t pay it any attention			0
' pregnancy itself can cause that to happen , and it certainly did n’t concern my midwife , ' she recalled			0
' the discharge did n’t have the characteristic odour that is associated with @entity21			0
' after the trauma of the premature labour and birth , mrs @entity5 was initially told it had occurred because she had an ' incompetent cervix '			1
this is a condition that occurs when weak cervical tissue causes the cervix to open too soon - causing premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy			2
it was only during a consultation with a specialist two years later that she was horrified to be told an infection must have caused @entity8 's early arrival			1
' i feel like it could have been totally avoided had i been given the right information , ' she said			0
like many women , mrs @entity5 had never heard of the condition			1
@entity8 's frail state when he was born meant doctors feared he may not live			1
' i feel like it could have been totally avoided had i been given the right information , ' his mother said ' @entity8 ’s experience was awful , and it was incredibly difficult for my husband and i to have to watch him suffer			2
' as a new mum , it was heartbreaking not to be able to cuddle my son for weeks after he was born			2
' she added : ' today , @entity8 is a happy , healthy little boy , but i am definitely one of the lucky ones			2
' she has decided to share her story to raise awareness and prevent other mothers going through the same terrible ordeal			0
' i do n’t want anyone else to have to go through what @entity8 endured , ' she said			2
' i would urge anyone in the early stages of pregnancy who thinks they may have the symptoms of @entity21 to speak to their midwives as soon as possible to ensure this terrible experience does n’t happen to them			0
' around 54,000 babies are born prematurely in @entity125 every year , one of the highest rates in @entity128			0
@entity21 affects one in three women , making it twice as common as thrush			1
it occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted , leading to an unpleasant odour			0
if untreated , it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting @entity38 such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia			1

symptoms include : * a strong smell , particularly after sexual intercourse * discharge that becomes a white or grey colour , or becomes thin and watery babies born before 37 weeks are classed as premature and as many of their vital organs will not have had a chance to fully develop causing both short terms problems , such as breathing and digestive difficulties , and potential longer term health implications , such as severe disabilities or cerebral palsy			1
her story follows research at the @entity171 , @entity172 , which found women who use shower gels and soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing @entity21			2
study leader @entity178 said there is ‘ mounting evidence ’ that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis			1
dr @entity178 's team recruited 141 women in @entity172 who agreed to answer questionnaires about their product use and undergo lab tests for vaginal infections			0
the researchers found that 66 per cent of the women reported using lubricants and cleansers internally			0
the most commonly used products were sexual lubricants - 70 per cent of the product - using group used commercial lubricants , while 17 per cent reported using petroleum jelly and 13 per cent used oils			0
test results showed that the women who used products not intended for internal use , such as oils and @entity205 , were more likely to have yeast and bacterial infections			2
for instance , 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly			1
mrs @entity5 was speaking out for @entity218 , held in association with @entity220			2

@entity5 , 42 , had normal pregnancy until waters broke at 25 weeks
@entity8 was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and needed much treatment
she was later told common infection , bacterial vaginosis , was to blame
affects a third of women and is often mistaken for thrush , but can cause fertility problems , miscarriage , premature labour and raise the risk of @entity240
