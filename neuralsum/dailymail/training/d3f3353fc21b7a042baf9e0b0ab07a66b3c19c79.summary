@entity1 cricket received another boost on sunday when @entity3 was called up to the squad for thursday ’s fourth @entity5 against @entity6 in @entity7 less than eight months after he was deemed ‘ unselectable ’ and sent home from the @entity10 tour			1
@entity3 , who has not played a test since he was all - but ignored by captain @entity12 on the final morning at @entity13 against @entity14 in july 2013 , replaces @entity15 in the 13 - man party after the @entity18 seamer pulled out with an injury to his left ankle			1
and with the @entity22 surface expected to offer enough bounce to keep the taller bowlers interested , the 6ft 7in @entity3 could walk straight back into the side in place of @entity27 , who went wicketless during @entity29 ’s otherwise triumphant victory last week ’s third test in @entity31 and struggled with his control			1
he ’s come through every challenge placed in front of him this season			2
there are obviously no guarantees of anything and he ’ll be nervous			2
but he should take a lot of confidence from his selection			2
’ it was painful to watch @entity3 ’s decline from the fearsome fast bowler with 90 wickets in 23 tests into the disconsolate figure bowling in the nets in @entity14 as he tried to reconstruct his action			1
recently he said : ‘ it was horrible , standing at the back of my mark thinking , “ where is this going to go ? ” ’ so alien did the ball feel , he even claimed to have lost sensation in his fingertips			2
his downward spiral had begun in 2012 , when @entity86 ’s captain @entity85 opportunistically objected to @entity3 ’s habit of dislodging the bails with his right knee at the point of delivery			1
in a bid to remedy the problem , @entity3 went wide of the stumps — and gradually found his technique unravelling			1
an attempt to wean him on to a shorter run - up did not help either			0
net loss : @entity3 declined during the ashes in @entity14 as he tried to reconstruct his bowling action but some sensitive remedial work with @entity35 assistant coach @entity104 , himself a former @entity5 bowler , helped restore @entity3 ’s confidence			1
and his 44 wickets this season in @entity108 of the @entity40 have come at a respectable 29 runs each			0
@entity104 said : ‘ he ’s obviously gone through a hell of a lot in the last few months but he ’s now at a stage where he ’s bowling well and confident in himself			0
given an opportunity , i think he ’ll do well			0
in his own head , he ’s back to bowling how he wants to bowl			0
’ @entity3 received the call on sunday from national selector @entity117 after heading down to @entity118 to be with his girlfriend and prepare for a one - day game in @entity121 for @entity122			1
but he has headed back to @entity123 to collect his test kit before joining up with the full squad in @entity7			2
@entity52 said : ‘ i spoke to him and he ’s really excited and looking forward to it			0
i ’m very proud of both him and @entity104			0
i ’ve just let them get on with it and they ’ve worked very well together			0
missing out : @entity15 has been withdrawn from the @entity29 squad because of an ankle injury the hope now in the @entity29 dressing - room is that the @entity22 pitch serves up the kind of pace and bounce which — before the square was rotated 90 degrees — used to be popular with @entity142			1
@entity52 was on sunday poring over footage from @entity146 ’s @entity145 quarter - final in @entity7 against @entity147 on saturday , and was especially pleased to see a match - changing triple - wicket maiden from home seamer @entity150			0
‘ the pitch looked like it had a bit of bounce in it , ’ he said			0
the @entity152 were impressed with @entity3 when @entity29 visited for a one - day tour at the end of 2011 , even though they lost 5 - 0 , and again when he and @entity41 bowled @entity12 ’s team to victory in the third test at @entity158 in december 2012			1
and he has enjoyed success in the past against @entity161 , who is averaging 54 in the current series			0
@entity3 is only 25 , still a few years away from his fast - bowling peak			1
if , after his traumatic winter , he ’s impatient to scale it more quickly than that , no - one will be blaming him			0

@entity15 injured his left ankle in second test against @entity6
@entity3 has not played a test for @entity29 since last summer
he was deemed ' unselectable ' after struggling @entity173
