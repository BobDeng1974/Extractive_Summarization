by @entity0 published : 14:44 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 2 september 2013 last week , personal trainer to the stars , @entity3 , shared the first part of her fat fighting secrets in a new blog which she promises will help people shape up in just a fortnight			1
the ' figure magic 14 ' plan is one she 's devised to work for her high profile clients - who include royalty to rock stars			1
now she 's giving mere mortals an insight into how to can achieve her toned results by posting daily lifestyle tips , meal plans and workouts on her website			1
last monday , the @entity24 featured the first day of the plan , and below you can see the details for days eight and nine			1
the remaining days of the plan can be accessed via @entity3 's blog			1
for those who have been following the diet and exercise tips , how can they stick with it now they 're half way through the 14 - day regime ? @entity3 , 38 , a mother - of - three recommends making a specific list of why you wanted to do the ' figure magic 14 ' in the first place			1
she said : ' is it to kickstart you into a healthier lifestyle ? is it to drop some body fat to spur you on ? is it to overhaul your eating habits positively ? is it to improve your fitness ? ' write down your reasons and and commit to them			1
' she also said those struggling should remember it 's only two weeks - and if you started last monday , you 're already half way there			2
she said : ' make a clear decision to commit fully to the remainder of the programme			2
you can do anything for two weeks			2
remind yourself that it 's a temporary situation and you can introduce some treats once you 've hit some goals			2
' but instead of indulging in fattening treats that may undo your efforts to tone up and lose weight , the @entity64 - based trainer recommends instead rewarding yourself with pampering treats instead			2
she said : ' book a massage , manicure or blow dry – anything to put a spring in your step without sabotaging your progress			2
' @entity3 explained of her programme that the aim of it is to ' energise you , cleanse you , nourish you and rid your body of as much body fat as one can sensibly do on any diet and fitness plan			1
if you stick to the programme for 14 days , you will achieve results that you and others will notice			1
' after the fortnight , she said people should stick to the principles as much as they can and remember that transforming lifestyle habits will take more time			1
she said : ' remember that this is a kick start – a true body transformation takes time , commitment and consistency so as you do the programme , commit to the aspects you can continue with forever			2
she added : ' keep a diet diary and note of the workouts completed so you have something to refer to once you 've completed the 14 - days and you can repeat it any time you need another fat burning boost			1
