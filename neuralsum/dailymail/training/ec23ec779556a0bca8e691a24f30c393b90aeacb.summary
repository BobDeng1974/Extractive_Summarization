@entity0 should n't have become embroiled in an altercation with @entity2 and ought to have been more responsible - particularly because he 's not even @entity3			1
that 's @entity6 's synopsis after his country 's dismal 4 - 0 defeat against @entity9 on monday as he laid the blame squarely at the central defender 's door			1
@entity13 were already two down when @entity0 - who @entity6 claims is ' not even a @entity3 man ' and should therefore ' behave in a certain way ' - pushed his head towards @entity2 after the pair became tangled in a needless spat			2
gone ! @entity0 was sent off by referee @entity18 during @entity13 's 4 - 0 defeat against @entity9 on monday you 're wrong ! @entity6 claimed the defender should have been more mindful of his responsibilities ouch ! @entity0 leaned into @entity2 after the pair had begun a spat with @entity13 already two goals down @entity2 exaggerated the contact before the @entity28 defender received his marching orders - a reputation of playacting and cheating seemingly going before him			1
@entity6 argues that even though the red card appeared harsh , @entity0 - born in @entity33 - needed to be mindful of letting his adopted country down			0
' i think obviously the second goal is his fault			0
he 's on a zone but he has to make contact with the opponents and he left @entity43 and @entity44 [ @entity44 ] completely on his own and nobody contacted him , no challenge and @entity43 scored the second goal , ' @entity39 â€™s @entity38 said			2
' after that i think the frustration of the mistake comes up and after that loses possession with the pressure of @entity2 and after that we can say is not a real aggression			2
' maybe he does n't deserve a direct red card but because , in spite of not being a clear aggression , there is a body language that many , many times pushes the referees to have these kind of decisions			0
' to leave a team playing with ten men for such a long time is obviously a big handicap for the team			0
' the fact that is not even a @entity3 man , i think that should put even more pressure on him to behave in a certain way , which he did n't			0
' laying down the gauntlet : @entity2 ended up netting a hat - trick for @entity9 in their opening game win			1

@entity13 defender was sent off for *headbutt* against @entity9
@entity2 scored a hat - trick for @entity83 's side
@entity85 *barely* got a kick as they were *outclassed*
