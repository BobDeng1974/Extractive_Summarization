by @entity0 this week i 've come back to reality with a bit of bump and realised it 's time for a healthier outlook on life			1
i came back from @entity9 music festival on monday feeling a bit jaded and in need of a detox			0
so i 've decided to try to cut back on the drinking and i am starting back with my gym instructor @entity14 next week			1
it was a beautiful summer 's day and it was so tempting to join him for a glass or three of a fine rose , but i resisted and opted for a fresh mint tea			2
you can see me pictured wearing a pair of @entity0 's very high - end @entity33 sunglasses - he has them on sale at @entity36 and they 've been doing a roaring trade since actress and model @entity41 was spotted wearing a pair			1
@entity0 was impressed by my abstinence but was n't too confident that my new ' tea - total ' regime would last to the end of the week			1
@entity0 enjoyed a trip to @entity47 this week , wearing a rather original pink hat we parted company and i decided that a late lunch was in order at @entity53 in @entity54 - and opted for a dozen @entity56 oysters , with a classic mignonette sauce and @entity58			1
they went down beautifully with a spicy @entity60 and after a dozen of these i was absolutely buzzing			0
these whopping great molluscs are basically just a protein delivery device and with a relatively low amount of fat			0
i was raring to go after 12 of them - no wonder , as they 're thought to be a natural aphrodisiac			0
@entity0 caught up with his old pal @entity0 and decided to forgo his usual tipple of rose and opted for mint tea instead finally wrapped the week off with a trip to @entity75 in @entity76 , the west @entity78 venue that combines nightclubbing with @entity79			1
i may have had a couple of drinks but it 's all in moderation			0
all the gang were there - @entity85 , @entity0 , @entity86 and @entity87 - and they were playing a few games of @entity89			2
it has pretty simple rules : you line up a few glasses of beer at the end of each table and if the ball lands in the glass you drink the beer			0
thankfully i 'm pretty good at table tennis so i stayed fairly sober but i have a major problem next week as it 's my birthday - wednesday 6th if you 'd like to wish me well - and i may have to take one day out of my new monk - like existence			2
until then , it 's all oysters and early nights			0
well up to a point â€¦ lots of love , @entity0 .			2
