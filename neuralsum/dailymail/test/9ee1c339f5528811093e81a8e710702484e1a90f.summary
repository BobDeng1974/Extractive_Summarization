the @entity0 are inching ahead of @entity1 as @entity2 starts to peel off @entity4 ’s supporters			1
and @entity6 voters are so alarmed by the prospect of being ruled by @entity8 with @entity4 in her pocket that they would prefer to get rid of her – and @entity11 – by giving the country independence after all			1
these are among the remarkable findings of a @entity15 poll for @entity16 which illustrates growing fears about the result of the most closely fought election for decades			0
a @entity15 poll for the @entity16 has shown a swing towards the @entity0 against @entity4 's @entity1 fear of @entity8 , pictured , among @entity1 voters in @entity6 is pushing them towards @entity2 @entity25 , pictured , has surged ahead by three points in the polls going into the final stage of the election the poll suggests @entity25 is pulling ahead of @entity1			1
the @entity35 are on 33 points , followed by @entity1 on 30 , @entity31 18 and the @entity32 9 – the third @entity15 poll in a row to show a lead for the @entity0			1
intriguingly , there are signs that @entity1 , and not the @entity0 , is at risk from @entity2 ’s @entity31			2
in the past three weeks , @entity31 support has risen by five points , with a corresponding four - point fall in backing for @entity1			2
furthermore , the @entity0 could benefit from @entity31 voters returning to them as a result of the ‘ @entity4 and @entity47 ’ factor			1
asked if they would consider voting conservative to stop a @entity51 alliance running the country , nearly two in five @entity31 supporters said yes , against one in two who said no. the new trends coincide with the huge impact of @entity58 on the campaign since the tv debates , in which she repeatedly squared up to @entity4			2
the poll offers @entity25 hope that more @entity31 supporters may be provoked into returning to the @entity0 as a result of the @entity8 threat			1
the dip in @entity4 ’s popularity appears to reflect the belief that if he relied on @entity8 to get his legislation approved by @entity72 , she would hold the whip hand – even though her party would have only a fraction of the number of @entity77			2
more than half of those polled think @entity8 would have the upper hand over @entity4 , with fewer than three in ten saying the @entity1 leader would call the shots			1
the latest poll expressed concern over the possible influence @entity8 would have over @entity4 the poll also highlights the growing resentment among @entity6 voters at the thought of @entity91 shaping laws in @entity6 on issues such as schools and hospitals , even though @entity6 @entity77 have no such power over these matters in @entity11			1
a third said that if the @entity100 produced a @entity51 pact to run @entity102 , they would regard the result as ‘ illegitimate ’			0
that bears out the stark warning made by home secretary @entity106 today of the danger of a backlash by @entity6 voters if the @entity109 is involved in the government of the @entity102			1
a total of 37 per cent of those polled said they would regard such a result as legitimate			0
according to the poll , @entity6 people may decide they would rather @entity11 was given independence than be ruled by @entity118 in harness with @entity1			1
in the event of @entity4 and @entity8 forming some kind of ruling pact , more than 40 per cent said they would prefer @entity11 to be independent			2
in effect , it could lead to @entity6 and @entity126 declaring independence from @entity11 in a reversal of last year ’s referendum , when the @entity11 voted to stay in the @entity102			0
the poll leaves no room for doubt where voters think @entity8 ’s heart lies			0
nearly three in four say she cares more about @entity11 independence than whether the @entity102 economy is doing will			0
fewer than one in eight disagree			0
the survey also contains more evidence of @entity25 ’s personal ratings lead over @entity4			0
by a margin of nearly two to one , the public believes @entity4 ’s claim that the prime minister was to blame for the deaths of nearly 1,000 migrants from @entity148 in the @entity149 showed that the @entity1 leader was ‘ unfit to be @entity145 ’			0
the survey also indicates the @entity35 are winning the key economic arguments			0
voters believe that if the @entity0 win the @entity155 on may 7 , the economy is more likely to grow over the next five years ; taxes and unemployment will be lower ; the country will be safer ; welfare abuse will be curbed and people will be generally better off			2
@entity1 won on two counts : better schools and hospitals and fewer food banks .			0

@entity6 voters have grave concerns over @entity8 's power plan
half believe ms @entity8 will have the upper hand over @entity4
@entity31 has been gaining support from former @entity1 voters and not @entity0
the poll shows @entity109 are more interested in independence that the economy
