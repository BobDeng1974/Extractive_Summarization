buyers must now increasingly treat asking prices as a starting point for negotiations as sellers demand silly prices , it is claimed			1
sellers are now wildly over-valuing their houses by around £ 74,000 – forcing buyers to barter them down , analysis shows while average sale prices are about £ 207,000 in the @entity5 , advertised asking prices are typically £ 74,000 higher at £ 281,000			1
researchers analysed sold price data from the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 and compared it to asking prices on the @entity5 ’s largest property website @entity28			1
online estate agent @entity29 said many sellers still believed they were selling at the market ’s peak and were routinely over-pricing their property , encouraging buyers to put in cheeky offers			1
a report said : ‘ previous high demand in many areas caused house prices in @entity40 and @entity41 to soar , with many sellers now looking to cash in as a result of a particularly buoyant market			1
‘ but as the market begins to cool , those looking to sell are doing so at increasingly unrealistic prices			1
’ last year , house prices rose by 8 per cent , according to @entity23 , peaking at 10 per cent over the summer			0
but forecasts suggest prices will grow at a fraction of this rate this year			0
the study said a recent fall in activity in the housing market had also prompted some estate agents to over-value properties in a bid to secure custom from depleted numbers of sellers			1
it said some agents ‘ overvalue a property on purpose to win the business and get the seller on their books ’ , knowing the price must later be knocked down significantly before it sells			2
@entity71 , of @entity72 , said : ‘ unfortunately it ’s a common place practice in the high street sector			0
‘ the agent is driven by a percentage fee so they will overprice a property to try their luck , win the business and increase their profit margins			0
a study found that @entity5 selling their properties refuse to admit the housing market has cooled and mistakenly believe they are sitting on a goldmine ‘ understandably the seller opts for the agent that claims they can get the highest price , as we are all motivated , to some extent , by money			1
‘ then as regular as clockwork the agent will ring them a few weeks down the line and ‘ advise ’ on a lower asking price in order to sell			2
‘ but it is , in part , down to the seller			0
‘ if someone has it in their head they should achieve x amount , they will list at this regardless of what advice they receive			0
’ a survey of 2,000 sellers in @entity40 and @entity41 , carried out by @entity111 , found that that more than half of sellers would list their property at a price recommended by their agent			1
but over a third said they would list at a higher price than this , while only one in 20 said they would go lower than the recommendation			0
a third of sellers also said getting the highest price was the most important factor , while a quarter said their priority was securing a buyer with stable finances			2
a seventh of respondents said not missing out on purchasing a new home they liked was the most important issue			0
@entity138 , of mortgage brokers @entity139 , said : ‘ estate agents say their biggest battle at the moment is trying to get sellers to agree to a realistic figure because they are reluctant to accept that prices have come down			0
‘ at the start of last year , we had the perfect storm			0
the economy was recovering and buyers and sellers who had done nothing for five years leapt into action			2
‘ lenders wanted to lend and the market went crazy , with almost every property receiving a ridiculous number of offers			0
‘ but we are now in a more sensible market and the buyers are back in control			2
there is no longer the same demand			0
’ he added : ‘ the difficulty is trying to get vendors to put their home on the market for a realistic price to get buyers through the door			1
‘ once they have interest in their property , they may find the price is pushed up if buyers enter into a bidding war			2

study shows @entity5 sellers refuse to admit the housing market has cooled
buyers increasingly treat asking price as starting point for negotiation
average sales price is £ 207,000 but average asking price is £ 281,000
