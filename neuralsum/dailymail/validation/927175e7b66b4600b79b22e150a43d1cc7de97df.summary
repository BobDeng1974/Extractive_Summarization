the @entity0 for @entity1 has cut 19 life - extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in january thousands of cancer sufferers will lose out on ‘ last chance ’ drugs after the @entity7 withdrew approval for their use			1
the @entity0 for @entity1 has cut 19 life - extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in january			1
they include @entity12 , used in prostate cancer , along with @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 for bowel cancer			0
new patients needing these drugs will no longer be able to get them on the @entity7 without a consultant ’s special request			1
but experts say this is doomed to fail and they will effectively only be available privately often costing thousands of pounds			1
following appeals , four drugs will be reconsidered and remain available in the meantime			1
dr @entity27 , consultant clinical oncologist at @entity28 , said the decision to axe @entity12 was a travesty			2
she said ‘ as a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer , i am deeply saddened and my patients will be devastated			2
‘ in my every day experience , @entity12 has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time – some of the men that i started to treat with @entity12 three to four years ago are still alive today			0
‘ most importantly this time has been of good quality , allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer			0
’ the £ 280million - a - year @entity0 ( @entity45 ) which began in april 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in @entity1 getting drugs banned on the @entity7 by @entity48 , the rationing body , or awaiting approval			1
the government 's aim , which was a @entity53 election pledge , was to enable @entity7 doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit			0
@entity57 , chief executive of the charity @entity58 , said ‘ we need to hold the government and the prime minister to account for what has happened			0
‘ he needs to justify why he no longer believes doctors should be able to prescribe the drugs they think will benefit their patients			1
‘ if this is not what he believes , then he needs to reverse these cuts until a new system is in place			0
’ he said tens of thousands of patients had petitioned @entity71 , urging him to keep his promise made before the last election and to postpone the cuts until a better , fairer system was in place			2
he said ‘ cancer treatment should n’t be about luck			0
there should be no difference in the access to treatment between a patient diagnosed a couple of weeks ago and one diagnosed tomorrow			0
‘ but there will be and we believe this is just the thin end of the wedge with further cost cutting to come			0
‘ from yesterday , any patients who faces an unfortunate diagnosis of advanced cancer will no longer be able to benefit from the treatments that have been removed from the @entity0			1
‘ the argument should n’t be about politics and economics , but so far this has been an exercise in managing budgets and maximising profits			0
‘ it should have been an exercise in what is important to patients and how to improve outcomes for cancer patients			2
’ new patients needing these drugs will need a consultant ’s special request to access the drugs on the @entity7 dr @entity111 , chief medical advisor of @entity112 , said @entity14 was an effective anticancer drug , which can improve the chances of long - term survival			1
he said ‘ this de-listing decision will significantly restrict patient choice – thus inevitably widening the gap in survival for @entity120 patients with colorectal cancer compared with the rest of the world			2
’ @entity124 , spokesperson for prostate cancer patients ’ charity tackle , said the removal of @entity12 , also known as cabazitaxel was a terrible blow			2
he said ‘ i am shocked that men in @entity1 can not get the same drugs as men in other @entity134 countries , especially when we have a @entity0 to supposedly pay for them			1
‘ for many men – myself included – cabazitaxel was going to be the next treatment option			0
in fact , the last treatment option we had left			0
‘ at the moment i ’m well , but in a few months ’ time i might not be ; for the first time in my entire cancer journey i ’m frightened			0
’ @entity146 , general manager for @entity147 in the @entity148 , said the company was continuing a ‘ dialogue ’ with @entity1 to explore immediate ways of maintaining access to patients for @entity12			1
a spokesman for @entity1 said ‘ @entity7 cancer doctors on the @entity0 panel have taken a careful look at how we ensure he drugs available offer the best clinical benefit , getting the most for patients from every pound			1

the @entity0 for @entity1 has cut 19 life - extending treatments
it claims they are too expensive to fund following a review in january
patients will now need a consultant to request the drugs specially
but experts say this will effectively mean drugs only available privately
