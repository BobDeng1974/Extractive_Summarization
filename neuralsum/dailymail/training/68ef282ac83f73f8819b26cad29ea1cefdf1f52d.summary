great - grandmother @entity2 issued a heartfelt plea to the cannabis grower to mend his ways as she described the devastating impact of her brother ’s drugs addiction on her family			1
even though mrs @entity2 says she had spoken about her family ’s experience ‘ hundreds of times ’ during her 14 years on the bench , she was told that her actions fell ‘ well below ’ the standards expected			1
following four complaints – including one from a pro-cannabis campaigner – mrs @entity2 was officially reprimanded			1
the decision was signed off by lord chancellor @entity31 and the lord chief justice , lord judge			0

mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i feel disgusted and let down			1
i was in the business of ensuring justice prevailed but there is absolutely no justice in what has happened to me			0
‘ i could not go back into an organisation where i felt i was being gagged and pilloried for speaking out about a substance which is illegal in this country			0
‘ i feel devastated that i have given the magistracy 14 years of my life and spoken about my brother ’s death hundreds of times helping hundreds of offenders and this is how i am repaid			2
’ in august last year , mrs @entity2 , who also works as a psychotherapist and mental health counsellor , spoke out about the death of her brother while sentencing @entity3 , 55 , to 200 hours unpaid work for growing cannabis			1
mrs @entity2 , told how her family went through a ‘ living hell ’ after her brother @entity62 died aged 39			1
he developed epilepsy , schizophrenia and depression following years of smoking cannabis and was found dead in a canal in 1997			1
following the hearing , and @entity71 ’ interviews in local and national media , the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case			0
this was triggered by complaints from three retired magistrates and a pro-cannabis campaigner who asked for mrs @entity2 to be removed from her position immediately			1
mrs @entity2 was then suspended			1
however , after a ten - month investigation the @entity68 opted only to reprimand her			0

mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i was suspended immediately and it was made very clear that i was n’t going to be receiving any support			1
‘ i just felt incredibly shocked and upset at the way i was being treated			0
i had not committed a criminal act – i was genuinely trying to help others			0
’ experience : the 65 - year - old chairman of the bench had cited the ' living hell ' her family went through after losing her brother @entity62 , pictured the decision to suspend and investigate mrs @entity2 was criticised by an anti-social behaviour reduction charity			1
@entity100 , who runs @entity101 , said : ‘ we find that it ’s not until someone dealing drugs meet families and victims caught up in the trade that things change			0
‘ i think the way this magistrate has spoken to this defendant is right			2
she might not be following the rule book exactly but it ’s these personal stories which will reach someone			0
’ and @entity116 , chief executive of the mental health charity @entity117 , also voiced support for mrs @entity2			2
she said : ‘ it is extremely sad that @entity2 has chosen to resign over this issue , but she has done a service in highlighting the dangers that cannabis can pose to those who are vulnerable to mental illness			1
‘ there is a growing body of evidence linking cannabis , especially in its strong form skunk , to mental illness , with all the damage that can inflict on individuals and their families			2
’ tragic : @entity62 developed schizophrenia and epilepsy , apparently as a result of cannabis use			1
he is pictured here with his father @entity140 in 1987 in a statement the @entity68 confirmed that mrs @entity2 was made subject to an investigation following the ‘ expression of personal views in court ’ and subsequent media interviews			2
a statement read : ‘ the investigation found the views expressed in court were inappropriate			0
‘ the lord chancellor and lord chief justice agreed and concluded that her combined actions fell below the standard of behaviour expected of a magistrate and have issued mrs @entity2 with a reprimand			1
’ mrs @entity2 , who lives with her husband @entity158 , 65 , in @entity159 , @entity160 , remained defiant last night			2
she said : ‘ it is ludicrous that as a magistrate i can not cite a personal experience where there have been devastating consequences because of cannabis abuse			2
‘ it is also doubly astounding that the views of a pro-cannabis campaigner were used to build a case against me			0
as far as i am aware , cannabis is still very much illegal in @entity172			2
‘ but i do n’t regret any of it and i would speak out again about the dangers of using drugs			0
my brother lost his life because of it and if i can save others from the devastation it causes i will			0
‘ when i spoke out i received dozens of letters of support from families whose children were abusing drugs telling me that they were grateful – even just for those it was worth it			0
