by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 13:53 est , 15 january 2013 president @entity1 is weighing 19 different gun control measures that he could enforce without congressional approval as he prepares to unveil on wednesday a comprehensive plan to address gun violence			1
vice president @entity6 discussed some of the measures with @entity10 @entity9 during a meeting monday , after @entity1 confirmed during the final press conference of his first term that he was prepared to side - step @entity14 to strengthen laws regulating firearms			1
' it was all focusing on enforcing existing law , administering things like improving the background database , things like that that do not involve a change in the law but enforcing and making sure that the present law is administered as well as possible , ' @entity9 rep. @entity26 of @entity27 told @entity28 about the meeting with @entity6			0
' @entity1 will be joined by @entity6 and a group of children from around the country who wrote letters to the president concerning gun safety in the aftermath of the massacre at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 last month that left 27 people dead			1
@entity56 claim that @entity1 would be overstepping his bounds by taking executive actions on gun control , and rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , has threatened impeachment as a result			1
' the president ’s actions are not just an attack on the @entity67 and a violation of his sworn oath of office – they are a direct attack on @entity71 that place all of us in danger , ' @entity60 said			2
' i will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary , including , but not limited to , eliminating funding for implementation , defunding the @entity10 , and even filing articles of impeachment			0
' the executive orders under review may include granting greater power to federal authorities for gun research , as well as measures requiring background checks for gun dealers ' employees , wider sharing of gun databases between federal and state agencies and stricter regulations on gun inventories			1
vice president @entity6 , who is leading @entity1 's push for greater gun controls , discussed some of the potential executive actions with @entity10 @entity9 during a meeting monday ' i 'm confident that there are some steps that we can take that do n't require legislation and that are within my authority as president , ' @entity1 said monday			1
@entity1 will reveal which measures he is considering on wednesday , when he is planning to present @entity14 with his comprehensive plan to address gun control			1
he is also reviewing measures that would need congressional approval , including an assault weapons ban and a limit on high - capacity magazine ammunition			0
gun rights groups fear that tighter controls will restrict responsible , sane adults from owning , obtaining and using certain firearms			0
@entity1 said monday that those fears are unfounded			2
' part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow here it comes , and everybody 's guns are going to be taken away , ' @entity1 said			2
he blamed gun rights groups for ' ginning up ' those fears			0
' my starting point is not to worry about the politics , ' @entity1 said			0
' my starting point is to focus on what makes sense , what works			0
what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we 're reducing the incidence of gun violence ? '			0
