a @entity1 mother is among nearly 100 women who have had babies by a @entity5 sperm donor who has triggered an international scare over the spread of an incurable genetic disease			1
the man , known only as @entity11 , carries a defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 ( @entity13 ) that can pass on a severe , life - limiting condition to his offspring			1
with demand for @entity5 sperm soaring , the donor is understood to have fathered 99 ‘ @entity23 babies ’ – as they are widely dubbed – across the world through the clinic @entity21			1
a child born from a parent with the defective gene has up to a 50 per cent chance of developing the disease			1
now four families are suing the sperm bank and the case has raised questions among fertility experts about @entity5 ’s booming , and unregulated , sperm export trade			1
@entity44 , from the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , said : ‘ the distribution and use of @entity5 and @entity49 sperm donors is not regulated or monitored , but patients are not told this			2
‘ @entity13 is a rare disease , but the terrible spread of the gene via this prolific @entity5 donor highlights the worrying dangers of the widespread use of a single donor			1
’ the @entity1 mother was one of 20 women treated at an @entity63 clinic in @entity60 who conceived using the rogue sperm , the @entity60 federal health authority revealed			0
but reports from a variety of countries show the donor has fathered many more children – 99 in total , including the ones on @entity60 , along with 44 across @entity72 , 34 in @entity49 and one in @entity74			0
@entity5 mother @entity75 , whose daughter inherited donor 7042 ’s illness , claims she was contacted by as many as 17 women with his children who had the condition			1
ms @entity82 said last night that it was possible more @entity1 women could have bought his donations with the defective gene online			1
donor 7042 ’s sperm was also exported to a closely associated centre in @entity49 – the @entity91			1
but in 2009 it was discovered he carried the @entity13 gene – despite undergoing tests and stating in a questionnaire for @entity21 that there were no genetic disorders in his family			1
the shock discovery was made when a baby conceived with his sperm in @entity60 was diagnosed with the condition			2
ms @entity75 was ‘ stunned ’ to be informed of his medical status by the @entity5 health authorities			0
and when her daughter @entity108 subsequently developed the illness , she became one of the families – three from @entity5 and one from the @entity49 – who are taking legal action against @entity21			1
the donor has fathered many more children – 99 in total , including the ones on @entity60 , along with 44 across @entity72 , 34 in @entity49 and one in @entity74			0
a class action lawsuit claims it failed to properly screen for the disorder before using his specimens			0
‘ the case is not about money or revenge , it is about the fact we have not been able to get any information and the only way we can do this is through a court , ’ ms @entity75 said			0
‘ there are no rules that say you must be told how many children these donors make and the sperm banks will not tell you			0
’ a limit should be set on the number of children who can be fathered by sperm donors , to combat fears that siblings or cousins could unwittingly meet and start families , experts say			2
clinics are currently allowed to sell sperm from a donor to thousands of women around the world , raising fears of an ‘ incest timebomb ’			2
one man could theoretically ‘ sire ’ an ‘ unlimited number ’ of children , say the researchers , writing in the journal @entity159			0
the panel suggests no donor should sire more than 100 offspring			2
the case comes as leading fertility scientists from @entity168 and the @entity169 are calling for new international rules limiting the number of children one donor can produce to 100			0
they say if a donor exceeds this there is a risk of siblings inter-breeding and suffering psychological damage on finding out they are related to hundreds of other children			2
dr @entity180 , the fertility expert who led the research at @entity168 , said : ‘ what is clear when buying sperm from abroad is that although the number of families a donor is allowed to father in the @entity1 is capped , it could be hundreds elsewhere			1
‘ if you can imagine finding out that you have 500 siblings across the globe — that could have a real risk to the mental health of a child			0
’ it is understood that @entity197 will claim that the legal claims against them are unfounded			0
managing director @entity200 has previously stated that @entity11 could not be ‘ clinically classified as having @entity13 , as it only occurs in some of his cells ’			2
the company ’s website states that it carries out genetic testing for a range of diseases including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anaemia			0
but it adds the disclaimer : ‘ it is impossible to rule out genetic disease with 100 per cent certainty since it is not possible to test for all inheritable diseases			0

donor 7042 carries defective gene known as neurofibromatosis 1 ( @entity13 )
ten of the donor *'s* offspring have already been diagnosed with @entity13
can increase risk of cancer , cause learning difficulties and reduce lifespan
four families are suing the @entity21 that supplied the sperm
