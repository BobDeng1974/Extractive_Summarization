here @entity0 gives you a guide on @entity3 , the team which stands in @entity5 's way of reaching the @entity7 group stages			1
that 's the same @entity34 who were beaten 5 - 0 on aggregate by the @entity12 in a @entity7 play - off last year			1
easy street : @entity5 defeated @entity34 5 - 0 on aggregate in a @entity7 play - off last season but with the @entity15 champions banned from @entity11 , @entity3 inherited the second of the two @entity7 places on offer to @entity15			1
they have only won the @entity15 top flight three times in the last 20 years , with their last success coming in 2009			0
besiktas are consistent finishers inside the top four , having only finished below the position just twice since 1980			0
@entity54 - @entity22 there 's plenty for @entity5 to be concerned about in @entity3 - especially their attacking prowess			1
the @entity15 side feature @entity22 in attack , with the former @entity24 and @entity61 striker an Â£ 8million signing from the @entity63 earlier this summer			1
hat - trick hero : @entity22 ( centre ) scored a treble for @entity3 on his home debut against @entity68 already he has found the score sheet , netting a hat - trick on his home debut in the third qualifying round 3 - 1 win over @entity68			2
manager - @entity74 as @entity76 boss , @entity74 was once touted as one of the @entity11 's most promising managers			0
the former @entity80 and @entity81 defender famously recorded two wins over @entity83 in the @entity85 qualifiers to help dump the @entity83 out of the tournament before @entity88 's side had even left @entity89 for @entity90 and @entity91			0
on the up : @entity74 is rebuilding his reputation at @entity3 after a disastrous spell at @entity95 after leaving @entity76 , @entity74 's reputation took a battering after just one season at @entity95 as he guided the @entity100 club to their worst league placing since 1992 , with a ninth placed finish			0
the former defender has since re-emerged at @entity3 where in his first season at the club he guided them back into @entity7 contention			0
out the hat : @entity11 general secretary @entity108 draws @entity3 in @entity109 to face @entity5 in the play - offs group stage campaigns : five ( last appearance - 2009 - 10 ) in the @entity7 era , @entity3 have only made the main tournament five times - never progressing beyond the group stage			1
last season : @entity119 play - offs having been out of @entity7 action since 2009 , the last three seasons have seen @entity3 compete in the @entity119			1
defeat in @entity83 : @entity3 reached the @entity119 last 16 in 2012 but were beaten by @entity122 along the way they reached the last 32 in 2011 before going one better in a year later to reach the last 16			0
but they were kicked out of the competition following their play - off victory over @entity129 last term following previous match fixing allegations			2
best @entity7 performance : quarter - finals ( 1986 - 87 ) @entity3 ' finest @entity7 campaign came in 1987 ... where they won just two games before reaching the quarter - finals			2
two victories to defeat @entity140 , were followed by a walkover victory over @entity142 who were prohibited by their @entity145 government from playing the tie			0
the joy for @entity3 was short lived however , as @entity149 thrashed them 7 - 0 on aggregate in the last eight			2
playing the @entity63 : @entity152 ( front ) looks stunned as @entity3 's biggest @entity7 away victory came at @entity24 with a 2 - 0 win in 2003 @entity11 records : biggest home win 3 - 0 vs @entity158 ( 19/09/00 , group stage ) biggest away win 2 - 0 vs @entity24 ( 01/10/2003 , group stage ) heavy hiding : but @entity163 was on target as @entity165 beat them 8 - 0 at @entity167 in 2007 to inflict their heaviest @entity169 defeat humiliated : @entity3 were hugely embarrassed after being beaten 8 - 0 by @entity165 in the @entity7 heaviest home defeat 0 - 3 vs @entity172 ( 03/11/09 , group stage ) heaviest away defeat 0 - 8 vs @entity165 ( 06/11/07 , group stage )			1
