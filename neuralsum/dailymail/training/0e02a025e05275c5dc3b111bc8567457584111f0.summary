a @entity1 couple who were held in @entity2 for nearly two years before they were cleared in the death of their eight - year - old daughter have sued the engineering firm that sent them overseas			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who finally returned home to @entity12 last thursday , filed a negligence and wrongful termination suit against @entity16 - based company @entity15 on monday			1
mr @entity18 , who had worked for the firm since 1999 , was sent to @entity2 to help improve the country 's drainage systems ahead of the @entity22 , the @entity17 reported			1
but the suit claims that it failed to provide security or cultural training in @entity2 , where mixed - race families are not accepted			1
the couple are @entity28 and had adopted three black children from @entity30			1
they added that the firm had ' abandoned them '			0
following the sudden death of their daughter @entity52 , who suffered an eating disorder after being malnourished as a young child , authorities accused them of adopting the children to harvest their organs , the couple said			1
police said the @entity41 had starved @entity52 to death			1
@entity15 says it checked on the family 's welfare and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on @entity18 's defense			1
it also says that @entity18 resigned after they offered him a leave of absence from his job			2
the family 's ordeal began in january 2013 , when @entity52 started foaming at the mouth , her father told @entity72 in an interview			2
he tried to save her but she passed away in hospital			0
without carrying out a full autopsy of the girl , @entity2 police turned their attention to the parents , who are of @entity28 descent			1
they were suspicious of the mixed - race family , the couple said			0
an initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their ' hereditary traits '			2
reunited : the couple appeared with their two adopted sons , @entity93 and @entity94 , at their church in @entity96 , @entity1 on sunday - but they said they felt the absence of their daughter welcomed back : pastor @entity99 led applause for the family during their first public appearance ' they thought we were human traffickers , ' @entity32 said			1
' they said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them			0
' @entity10 added : ' for me , the hardest part , i think , was being asked over and over , ' are you the real mom ? '' prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night , but he @entity41 said @entity52 suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in @entity30			1
they were thrown in jail and the boys were sent to a @entity2 orphanage for four months			2
while locked up , @entity9 said that he was physically and sexually assaulted while in prison			0
their case was finally heard for the first time in november 2013 and they were convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison			0
but after a year in prison , holes started to emerge in the prosecution 's case and a judge granted them bail			2
missed : they were thrown in prison after their daughter @entity52 ( pictured front ) suddenly died in january 2013			1
she had been severely malnourished before she was adopted and suffered an eating disorder a forensic pathologist hired by the family concluded there was ' no medical evidence ' that the girl was starved by her parents and a proper autopsy was never carried out			1
during that time , the @entity150 called the case ' unfair ' but failed to lobby for their release - and @entity32 said he wonders if that was political			2
' the @entity33 government could have done a lot more , a lot quicker , ' he told @entity72			0
' @entity2 is such an important military base -- for the @entity33 i felt like the @entity33 government was unwilling to rock the boat and unwilling to make a strong stance with knowing that we were innocent			2
' but the department argued that secretary @entity163 had discussed it with the foreign minister			0
then last sunday , a @entity2 judge finally overturned their conviction - but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day			0
their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure wednesday , with mr @entity18 being detained for several minutes at the airport 's passport control station as his wife watched in tears			0
return : the @entity180 finally left @entity2 on wednesday after a appeals judge threw out their conviction back home : the couple was reunited with their children and other relatives after they landed on thursday they finally arrived back in @entity12 on thursday			1
@entity9 and @entity10 are in @entity12 , ' the @entity190 , which represents them , tweeted			2
' they have not stopped smiling			0
' the couple said they are relieved to be home and were pictured with their two sons at their @entity96 church on sunday			0
' it was just nice to be there with our church family again , ' @entity10 said			0
' but at the same time , we were just sitting in our usual order with the kids in between us , but there was just one who was missing			0
' see below for video			0

@entity32 and @entity10 say engineering company @entity15 failed to give them security or cultural training for @entity2
the @entity28 couple , who have three black children , said the country bans adoption and treats @entity216 as ' the lowest racial class '
the couple were thrown in prison after their daughter @entity52 died after suffering an eating disorder and @entity18 said he was forced to quit his job
but the company , which is based in @entity16 , said they spent thousands of dollars on their defense and that he quit the firm
the @entity41 were jailed for a year and were ultimately cleared
