@entity1 @entity0 edged @entity2 in a play - off to clinch his maiden @entity5 title at the @entity6			1
a par on the first extra hole was enough to steer the 41 - year - old past the @entity10 , who missed the green on the 18th and then over-hit his chip			1
@entity14 's fourth - round 66 forced the play - off after an intense back - nine battle , which ended with his birdie on the 18th tying things up with @entity20 at 13 under par. @entity22 holds the trophy aloft after completing his first win on the @entity5 at the age of 41 the @entity1 consoles @entity2 after beating the @entity10 on an 18th hole play - off in @entity29 but the 35 - year - old will be left lamenting the fact that his three bogeys on the day - to @entity22 's two - and a costly second - round 69 ultimately cost him victory			1

" i felt quite calm , the only thing is that hole at the end you never want to have a go at the pin because you can make a bogey quite easily so i was n't really sure how to play it , " @entity22 told the @entity5 website			0
herd became the oldest man to win his maiden @entity5 title since @entity37 in 2006 @entity2 played well to force a play - off but will regret his three bogeys in a round of 66 that left him on 13 under " unfortunately @entity2 made a bogey , i would have rather one of us made a birdie because he 's a great guy and it would be nice to earn the win on a positive note			2
but i 'll take the win and i 'm ecstatic			0
