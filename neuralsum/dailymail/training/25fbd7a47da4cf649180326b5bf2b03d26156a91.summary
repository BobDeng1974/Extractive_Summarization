it has until now been the work of science fiction and horror films , but scientists could soon be carrying out complete human head transplants , a leading surgeon has said			2
the procedure has previously been performed on monkeys but recent technological breakthroughs that make it possible to reconnect spinal cords could see the operation carried out on humans			1
neurosurgeon dr @entity15 , from the @entity14 , believes the operation would take 100 surgeons up to 36 hours and would cost £ 8.5million			1
an @entity18 neurosurgeon believes doctors now have the technology to transplant human heads			2
the procedure , which has previously been performed on monkeys , could be used to replace one human head with another due to recent advancements in cell and nerve research that make it possible to reconnect spinal cords the head to be transplanted would be cooled to between 12 ° c and 15 ° @entity31 surgeons would then have one hour to remove both heads and reconnect the transplant head to the circulatory system of the donor body			1
the spinal cord would be cut with a sharp scalpel and ' mechanically connected ' to the other body			0
while the head is reconnected , the donor body must be chilled and put into total cardiac arrest			0
the donor body 's heart could then be restarted once the head was reconnected			2
neurosurgeon dr @entity15 believes the operation would take 100 surgeons up to 36 hours and would cost £ 8.5million			1
in 1970 , @entity48 neurosurgeon dr @entity47 successfully transplanted the head of rhesus monkey onto the body of another			1
then in 2001 , doctors in the @entity48 carried out a similar operation			0
the monkey was able to smell , open its eyes and taste food yet because @entity47 could n't reconnect the animal 's spinal cord , it was left paralysed and died hours after surgery			2
more recent advancements in cell and nerve research could make reconnecting spinal cords possible and @entity15 believes this means there is no longer a barrier when it comes to transplanting human heads			1
in a paper , published by @entity73 , @entity15 said : ' the greatest technical hurdle to cephalosomatic linkage [ head transplant ] is of course the reconnection of the donor ’s and recipients spinal cords			1
' it is my contention that the technology only now exists for such linkage			0
' he adds that the procedure would be similar to that used in previous experiments			0
both parties would be put to sleep			0
in 1970 , an @entity48 neurosurgeon successfully transplanted the head of rhesus monkey onto the body of another , pictured			2
later , in 2001 , doctors in the @entity48 carried out a similar operation			0
the monkey was able to smell , open its eyes and taste food yet because doctors could n't reconnect the animal 's spinal cord , it died the head to be transplanted would be cooled to between 12 ° c and 15 ° @entity31 surgeons would then have one hour to remove both heads and reconnect the transplant head to the circulatory system of the donor body			1
the operation would have to be carried out within this time because an hour is the longest a human brain can survive without a steady flow of blood and oxygen			2
@entity116 in the 1931 horror film @entity117			0
plans put forward by @entity15 could lead to @entity117 - style head and body transplants @entity15 explains in his paper that the spinal cord would have to be cut with a sharp scalpel and would need to be ' mechanically connected ' to the other body			1
in his paper , @entity15 proposes cutting spinal cords with an extremely sharp knife , then mechanically connecting the spinal cord from one head to another body			1
he said : ' it is this ' clean cut ' [ which is ] the key to spinal cord fusion , in that it allows proximally severed axons to be ‘ fused ’ with their distal counterparts			0
this fusion exploits so - called fusogens / sealants …			0
[ which ] are able to immediately reconstitute ( fuse / repair ) cell membranes damaged by mechanical injury , independent of any known endogenous sealing mechanism			0
' while the head is reconnected , the donor body must be chilled and put into total cardiac arrest			0
the donor body 's heart could then be restarted once the head was reconnected			2
a head to body spinal connection has n't been attempted yet , but @entity15 cites previous studies where scientists have reconnected a spinal cord to a rat			1
in those experiments the rat was given limited movement			0
@entity15 also cites studies in which plastics such as polyethylene glycol ( @entity163 ) have been used to reconnect a severed spinal cords in dogs .			1

dr @entity15 says we now have the technology to replace one person 's head with another by reconnecting spinal cords
the procedure involves the same *methods* used to successfully transplant the head of a monkey
it would take 100 surgeons three days to perform the operation , he says
' several human *diseases* without cure might *benefit* from it , ' he says
