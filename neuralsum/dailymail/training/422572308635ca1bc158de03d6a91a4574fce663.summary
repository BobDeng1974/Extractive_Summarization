@entity0 sparked outrage yesterday by comparing the @entity3 referendum to @entity5 ’s post-apartheid election			1
the first minister said the sight of his countrymen waiting in line to register to vote was similar to that of black @entity5 forming long queues outside polling stations in 1994			1
but while @entity3 have long enjoyed the full trappings of democracy – and elect both @entity3 and @entity17 mps – black @entity5 were having their first sight of the ballot box after centuries of cruel exclusion			1
‘ it was the first free , democratic election in @entity5 ’s history , when people who had never been allowed to vote in their lives did so , ’ he added			1
‘ comparing that with the @entity3 referendum just underlines how the @entity39 campaign is resorting to desperation and irrationality			0
‘ @entity5 was a brutal police state , with state terror , state - sponsored assassinations , torture , absolute denial of human dignity if you had the wrong colour skin			1
‘ to compare it to @entity3 seeking independence is just insulting to the freedom struggle that @entity52 led			0
’ @entity30 peer @entity53 said : ‘ it is an outrageous comparison			1
black people were oppressed and unable to vote , which has never been the case in @entity3			2
‘ it is insulting to anyone involved in democratic elections here over the century and belittles what people went through in @entity5			2
' this is typical of @entity0 ’s hyperbole			0
scots have always been a key part of running the @entity17 , including with @entity3 prime ministers			0
‘ he accuses the no campaign of panicking , but making this comparison is just desperation			2
’ and @entity72 broadcaster @entity71 , who was raised in @entity5 by @entity3 parents , said : ‘ voting was not possible for many in @entity5 until that election , that is why they queued for one or two days to vote			1
’ describing what he saw in @entity80 , mr @entity0 had said : ‘ [ it was ] almost reminiscent of the scenes in @entity5 that some of us of a certain age remember from 20 years ago or so when people queued up to vote in the first free elections			1
’ ' preposterous comparison ' : voters pictured queuing in @entity5 's first free election in april 1994 mr @entity0 yesterday also dismissed reports that the @entity92 is concerned about the prospect of @entity3 independence			1
he said : ‘ i want the @entity92 as head of state , as queen of @entity3 of an independent @entity3 as her ancestors were			0
' @entity92 , who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign , will be proud to be @entity92 of @entity3 , and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land			2
‘ i had an audience at @entity105 some two weeks ago , but the proper position is you do n’t discuss these matters in public			0
' the statement from the palace about the @entity92 ’s neutrality in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one			0
’ the first democratic elections took place in @entity5 over three days from 27 to 29 april , 1994			1
despite threats of violence , the voting was largely peaceful			0
mr @entity52 , who had been imprisoned by the apartheid regime for 27 years , became the country ’s first black president after his @entity123 party won 62.5 per cent of the votes			2
the parliament in @entity126 was formed in 1999 following the referendum campaigned for by @entity128 two years previously			0
its powers including running the health service and education north of the border			0
since 1707 there have been 12 prime ministers who were either @entity3 - born or of @entity3 extraction			0
@entity136 , @entity30 mp for @entity137 , who lived in @entity5 for several years as a child before returning to @entity3 , said : ‘ to compare any vote in @entity3 , no matter how important , with @entity5 ’s first ever democratic election is crass			1
‘ @entity3 is not @entity141 and a decision on whether or not we stay @entity17 has no parallels at all with the beauty of the liberation of @entity5 from the evil type of racism that was apartheid			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity3 ’s first minister seems to be getting carried away with himself the nearer we get to referendum day			0

he said long queue of voters was similar to that of post-apartheid election
1994 vote came after centuries of cruel exclusion for black @entity5
*critics* said first minister 's comments were ' belittling ' what *happened*
@entity30 ex-minister @entity27 said the comparison was ' preposterous '
