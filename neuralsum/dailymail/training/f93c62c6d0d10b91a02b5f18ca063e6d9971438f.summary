by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 21 november 2013 loss : @entity1 from @entity2 , @entity3 , pictured before he was disabled , died after he was flung from a car that was hit by a train a wheelchair - bound pensioner was killed when a train slammed into a car he was in that had cut out on a railway level crossing , a coroner has been told			1
the vehicle , which contained 85 - year - old @entity1 , who was sat in his wheelchair inside the vehicle , stalled and broke down as it was being driven over the crossing			1
mr @entity1 , of @entity2 , @entity3 , died instantly when he was flung from the car and his wheelchair as the train passed through the level crossing and smashed into the car			1
seconds earlier driver @entity21 had stalled as he drove across the tracks before the barriers were activated			0
he frantically tried to restart the car as the barrier closed while the train bearing down on them			1
motorists from another car scrambled to help the stricken driver and his disabled passenger in the ' nightmare ' scenario , the inquest in @entity29 heard			1
however , the car would not start and the train had no time to stop , leading to the fatal crash			1
mr @entity1 , aged 85 years , was in the back of the @entity40 car being driven by his civil partner mr @entity21			1
@entity29 deputy coroner @entity42 heard how the 78 - year - old drove onto the line in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity3 , on january 3 this year , when the engine cut out			0
after trying a number of times to restart the car nearby motorists @entity50 and partner @entity53 rushed to the ' panicking ' driver who was still trying to start the car as it was hit			1
mr @entity21 survived the impact but suffered serious injuries as a result of the collision			0
investigating officer detective constable @entity60 told the inquest the driver of the train , which was travelling from @entity64 to @entity65 , braked and sounded the horn on approach			2
@entity68 : the car drove onto the line in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity3 , on january 3 this year , when the engine cut out ' as the driver accelerated to come across the crossing the car stalled and the engine stopped , ' she said			1
' he tried to start the car a number of times but with no success			2
' she told the inquest mr @entity21 had previously reported to a garage that the car had once failed to start but it passed an @entity86 test in march last year			2
@entity88 vehicle examiner @entity87 said the extent of damage to the car meant tests were inconclusive but the ' most probable ' reason was a failure of its engine management system			2
@entity97 's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone			0
there are 7,000 in the @entity97 and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths			0
almost £ 110million has been set aside for the purge , which will also pay for new bridges , underpasses , gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the @entity97 safer			0
this has been spearheaded by the parents of @entity112 , 14 , and her friend @entity113 , 13 , who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at @entity119 station footpath crossing in @entity120			1
@entity122 section supervisor @entity121 said the crossing ’s barriers were operated automatically by track circuits which detected approaching trains			2
these give a minimum of 27 seconds from the barriers coming down until a train passes through			0
the pensioner ’s car was hit after 45 seconds ' if somebody had picked up the phone immediately and said ‘ stop ’ it may well have been still too late ' , mr @entity121 added			2
recording a verdict of accidental death , mrs @entity42 said mr @entity1 ’s wheelchair was not totally secured into the back of the car			1
he was wearing a seatbelt and the wheelchair winch mechanism was attached but two other tether points were not			0
he died from impact injuries sustained when he struck the ground			0
she said of the ' nightmare scenario ' : ' the horror of being there and not being able to start the car does not bear thinking about			1
' had the wheelchair been tethered properly it is more likely he would have remained in the vehicle and he would have suffered less severe injuries			0
' she also concluded there ' was a problem with the engine management system ' but added that ' we ca n’t take it further than that '			0
two nieces who attended the inquest said the family felt ' very sorry ' for the train driver who they did not hold responsible in any way for the collision			0
“ this was a very tragic way for my uncle to die and the family are sad that his long life ended in this way ” , they said			0
* just 10 days ago a woman aged in her 40s had to be cut free from her @entity179 car after being struck by a train at the same crossing			1
she suffered non-life threatening injuries and was detained under the @entity183 .			0
