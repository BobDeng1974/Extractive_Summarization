three patients a week wake up from anaesthetic while they are undergoing surgey , new figures suggest			2
around one patient in every 19,000 spontaneously experience the ' accidental awareness ' after not being given enough general anaesthetic			1
but often surgeons are left completely unaware their patients are awake , because they are unable to move or make a sound			1
this means that each year there could be as many as 158 patients whose anaesthetic fails to work properly			1
the @entity13 said that accidental awareness is one of the ' most feared ' complications of general anaesthesia for both patients and doctors			1
it occurs when general anaesthesia is intended but the patient remains conscious			2
a new report from the @entity13 and the @entity32 and @entity33 studied three million operations conducted in public hospitals in the @entity16 and @entity33 - including 300 reports of awareness			1
the authors found that some surgeries - such as cardiothoracic operations and caesarean sections - carry a higher risk than others and people who have been given muscle relaxants are also more likely to suffer this complication			0
often surgeons are left completely unaware their patients are awake , because they are unable to move or make a sound they said the majority of failures occur before surgery starts or after it finishes			1
but just over half of those who spontaneously reported the failure said the incident had caused them distress and around 40 per cent suffered longer - term psychological harm such as post-traumatic stress disorder , authors said			0
sensations experienced when accidentally aware included tugging , stitching , pain , paralysis and choking , they found			0
and patients described feelings of dissociation , panic , fear , suffocation and even dying , the authors said			0
they made a series of recommendations , including the introduction of a simple anaesthesia check list which should be performed at the start of every operation			0
they also called for a structured approach to the management of patients who report awareness			2
' we found that patients are at higher risk of experiencing accidental awareness during general anaesthesia ( @entity85 ) during caesarean section and cardiothoracic surgery , if they are obese or when there is difficulty managing the airway at the start of anaesthesia , ' said project lead professor @entity93 , a consultant anaesthetist in @entity94			2
' the use of some emergency drugs heightens risk , as does the use of certain anaesthetic techniques			0
however , the most compelling risk factor is the use of muscle relaxants , which prevent the patient moving			0

one in every 19,000 patients experience ' accidental awareness '
often surgeons unaware patient is awake , because they ca *n't* move or talk
every year there are around three million operations conducted in the @entity16
study says there could be as many as 158 patients whose anaesthetic fails
