by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 22 february 2013 an @entity2 woman was forced to give birth alone in hospital in the dead of night because , she claimed , nursing staff did not respond to her cries for help			1
to add to @entity10 ’s distress , she had to fumble through her handbag for pain killers while she was in labour			1
‘ i could have had more support at home , ’ she said yesterday as an investigation began into the affair of the mother who had to deliver her own baby at @entity19 ’s @entity18			1
ordeal : the pregnant woman was left to give birth on her own in the middle of the night despite screaming out for help ( file picture not of woman involved ) ‘ i was left alone just to be in pain and deliver a baby myself , ’ @entity30 told @entity32 news			1
‘ i was screaming out " the baby ’s coming ! " ‘ next thing you know she was born on the bed			1
’ the terrifying incident did not end there , for the baby girl was born face down in her fluid at 2.15am and a pregnant woman in a nearby bed had to come to the new mother ’s aid and work at keeping the new - born child alive			1
‘ i heard her ( @entity30 ) moaning and it become quite loud and it didn ’ t sound right to me , ’ said the pregnant patient , who wanted to be known only as @entity51			0
‘ the baby appeared in a breach position and in a facedown position on the bed			2
’ she said she then got the baby ‘ breathing and crying ’ and then she and @entity30 claim they had to wait for five to 10 minutes before a nurse arrived			0
the ordeal for @entity30 began on tuesday when she arrived at @entity18 at 8.30am experiencing labour pain with her third child			2
she was taken to the birthing unit but several hours later staff asked her to leave because they said she was not ready to give birth			0
miss @entity10 refused to go home and was then admitted to the maternity ward where a nurse reportedly told her to time her own contractions			2
miss @entity10 said staff failed to regularly check on her progress and for the next 18 hours she was given just four @entity76 and one endone tablet , including taking @entity76 tablets from her handbag , for pain relief			0
the hospital ’s director of nursing and midwifery , mr @entity81 , told @entity19 ’s @entity84 that the incident would be thoroughly investigated , but he pointed out that the birth and maternity units had highly trained midwives and a full complement of staff at the time			0
‘ birth can be unpredictable and can at times come on quite quickly			0
staff provided regular monitoring of the patient and offered the best possible care in the time frame , ’ he said			0
@entity100 spokesman @entity99 has demanded answers from the @entity103 state government , saying it was completely unacceptable for a woman to have to give birth unattended ‘ not to mention incredibly dangerous			1
’ last night mother and baby were said to be healthy and ‘ doing well ’ .			0

@entity10 screamed ' the baby *'s* coming ' from her bed in @entity18 , @entity103
but nobody came to her aid and she gave birth on her own in the middle of the night .
