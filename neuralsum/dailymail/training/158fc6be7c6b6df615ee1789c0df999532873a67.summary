@entity1 's trip to @entity2 to play @entity3 was not going to be the big fixture of a weekend in which @entity5 entertain @entity6 but @entity7 has changed all that			1
the former @entity10 manager has looked back in his element this week taking training at @entity1 's @entity14 training ground and his arrival has turned the spotlight on @entity3 's @entity18 stadium this weekend			1
with @entity20 , as his full - time bilingual shadow , @entity7 has taken training all week barking orders in @entity22 with @entity20 , a 25 - year - old former journalism graduate and youth football coach translating when necessary			2
and @entity7 has already taken his first big decision by insisting that @entity1 b - team manager @entity39 , who took charge of the first team as caretaker boss for one game after @entity7 ' predecessor @entity44 was sacked , remains part of his team			1
@entity39 managed the team to a victory over champions @entity49 in his only game in charge and he has impressed @entity7 to the point where he will be alongside him on the touchline on saturday			2
real are 15th but there are 27 games left of this season and they have already beaten @entity57 at home , as well as that win over @entity49 , so there is plenty of room for optimism			0
@entity7 also has @entity64 back from scoring twice against @entity65 on international duty			1
he returned to training on wednesday afternoon and should start tomorrow in search of his 50th goal in his 140th game for the club having had a suspension lifted after being wrongly accused of diving to win a penalty in the team 's last game			0
@entity7 walks out to take one of his first training sessions at the @entity14 training ground @entity64 ( right ) will be available for @entity7 's first game against @entity3 in @entity81 ' i like to play football that people enjoy watching , ' @entity7 said at his presentation			1
' but most importantly i want to win			0
' that went down well among fans of a club who have seen their side play attractive football across the last two seasons but fail to turn the performances into points			0
@entity7 ' style will suit the @entity95 according to former @entity97 player @entity96 , who also played at @entity98 and so knows both leagues well			2
he said : ' if there is one place where the @entity104 roots of football in @entity27 have endured it is in the @entity95 country			0
' @entity7 ( right ) poses alongside @entity1 president @entity106 ( left ) at @entity107 another veteran of both leagues , former @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity1 striker @entity111 added : ' it 's another style of football here but @entity7 is a good enough coach to handle that ; just look at what he achieved at @entity117			1
' but with the finishing touches being put to the plans ahead of his first game in charge , @entity7 is now looking forward to a new beginning			2
' i have enjoyed working this week with the players , they seem very open to what i want from them			0
the vibrations are good and i 'm anxious to get started , ' he said .			0
