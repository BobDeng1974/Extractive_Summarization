by @entity1 reporter published : 07:37 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 23 november 2013 @entity3 the daredevil moggy is back in the arms of his loving owner after getting stuck on a 90ft high railway viaduct for three days			2
the two - year - old grey and white cat was spotted on the viaduct above @entity11 , @entity12 , less than 300 metres from his home , on wednesday afternoon			1
the fearless feline was finally captured in a humane trap after he took the bait on thursday night and was brought back down to earth on a cherry picker on friday			1
mr @entity26 , 20 , said : ' @entity3 had been missing for three days and he is never normally gone that long			2
' i was worried where he had gone when one of my friends posted an article on @entity44			2
' i saw the picture and recognised @entity3 immediately			0
i could tell by his tail and he has a bit of an attitude			0
' i was amazed , i can see the viaduct from my house but i would never expect to look for my cat up there			2
gotcha : firefighters use a cherry picker to finally bring @entity3 back down to earth ' you always hear about these mad stories but you do n't expect it to be your own cat			1
' following his rescue @entity3 was treated to a luxury chicken liver pate dinner and taken to the @entity35 's hospital for a check - up before he was reunited with @entity26			1
mr @entity26 , an it support worker , added : ' this is @entity3 's biggest adventure to date			0
you usually find him in weird places but i think he has now found his limit			0
' i want to thank everyone who has helped , there has been a lot of fuss and i really appreciate it			0
we have a few cats but he is my favourite			0
' we always chill out together			0
i will have to lock the doors now and be a bit more protective - i think he needs a @entity82 collar			0
' handful : mr @entity26 only realised adventurous @entity3 was the stricken cat when a friend posted an appeal for the owner on @entity44 how did you get up there ? the cat 's tiny figure can be seen in the middle of the viaduct 90ft from the ground and five foot from the top of the viaduct			1
@entity35 and firefighters used a hydraulic lift to get up to the cat @entity100 , the @entity35 inspector who rescued @entity3 , says she thinks he must have got on tracks at @entity11 station and wandered down to the ledge			1
she said : ' it is an absolute miracle he was not hit by a train , electrocuted or fallen off the viaduct			0
he is the luckiest cat i have ever met			2
' he has used up one of his nine lives , hopefully he has a few left			0
' huge : the viaduct is a landmark in @entity11 but posed a challenge for @entity35 officers and firefighters who had to try to reach the cat safely			1
they stopped as @entity119 fell on thursday but returned today to catch it @entity11 fire station manager @entity121 said : ' we worked with the @entity35 and used our hydraulic platform to bring the cat down to safety			1
' we generally do n't attend cat rescues unless there could be potential risk to life , whether that be a member of the public , someone from the @entity35 or another partner agency			1
' although the @entity35 is more than capable of rescuing animals , sometimes , like in this case , they do n't have the right equipment to be able to reach them			1

feline became stranded 90ft above @entity11 , @entity12 on wednesday
@entity35 and firefighters tried to coax it down but cat would n't move
crews baited cat trap on thursday night and snared the cat on friday
