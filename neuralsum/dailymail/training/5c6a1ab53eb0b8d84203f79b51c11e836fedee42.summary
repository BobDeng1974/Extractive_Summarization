by @entity0 last updated at 12:11 pm on 3rd november 2011 almost £ 1billion was wiped off @entity5 ’ market value yesterday after the boss of the state - backed banking group went on immediate sick leave			1
shares plummeted after @entity8 began an enforced break barely eight months after taking on one of the biggest jobs in @entity13 finance			1
the @entity15 - born banker , who became chief executive in march with a package worth around £ 8.3million , has been diagnosed with extreme fatigue and stress due to overwork			1
fatigue : @entity8 , pictured with wife @entity21 at a charity event , was put on sick leave just six months after becoming chief executive of @entity5 with a package worth £ 8.3m doctors ordered the 47 - year - old father of three – who was also promised a ‘ golden hello ’ worth up to £ 4million in shares – to rest for six to eight weeks because he is physically and mentally exhausted			1
city sources say he is unlikely to return to his post			0
the unexpected announcement caused turmoil in the part - nationalised bank and sent @entity5 shares sliding			1
by the close of trading last night they had dropped by 4.4 per cent , ending the day 1.36p down at 29.2p			0
that was the biggest percentage fall in the @entity41 and wiped £ 930million off the value of @entity43			0
it left the taxpayer , which owns 40 per cent of the bank , £ 372million worse off			0
after an emergency board meeting , @entity5 group finance director @entity48 was appointed ‘ interim ’ chief executive			1
but he has already announced his resignation and leaves early next year			0
mr @entity8 – distinguished by his slicked - back hair and designer stubble – has lured many former colleagues from @entity55 , his former employer , to @entity5			1
exhausting work : the banking chief was in the process of implementing his vision for @entity5 , which included the layoff of around 15,000 mr @entity48 was one of the last of the old guard remaining from the regime of ex-chief executive @entity64 , who was behind the disastrous takeover of @entity66 and until recently was still being paid almost £ 100,000 a month by @entity5 for doing nothing			1
mr @entity8 ’s ‘ leave of absence ’ means @entity5 is left with no boss and a new management team to confront a deepening economic crisis			1
his illness comes at a bad time as he was implementing his strategic vision for the bank , which included overseeing an @entity77 - imposed sale of 632 branches , a revamp of its @entity81 brand and around 15,000 job losses			0
@entity5 is due to announce its third - quarter results next week which , given the state of the economy , are unlikely to be good			1
in a recent interview , mr @entity8 , whose hobbies include swimming with sharks and scuba diving , described ‘ working 24/7 ’ in his efforts to turn around @entity5			1
first signs that all was not well with the banker – hailed at home as @entity15 ’s third - greatest export behind footballing stars @entity95 and @entity97 – followed his non-appearance at a parliamentary committee meeting on tuesday			0
the bank issued a statement yesterday saying : ‘ the board of @entity43 announces that following medical advice @entity8 is taking a temporary leave of absence from his duties as group chief executive due to illness			1
’ the bank added : ‘ @entity110 is expected to return to his position before the end of the year			0
’ but last night doubts remained about whether he will return to one of the toughest jobs in @entity13 banking , second only to @entity120 ’s task as boss of state - backed @entity122			2
one banking source said : ‘ there ’s no way he can come back			0
’ by @entity127 city editor financial fatigue : @entity5 ceo @entity8 has been signed off sick due to ' overwork ' the stress - related absence of @entity8 from @entity5 is the latest in a succession of shocks that have undermined the strength and reputation of what was once considered @entity13 ’s best - run bank			1
it leaves @entity5 rudderless at a time of ferocious storms in the financial world , with the flood waters from the euroland crisis already spilling over on to this nation ’s shores			1
what is even more shocking is that mr @entity8 was seen as the great hope for retail banking in @entity13			1
in conversations we had over recent months he pledged to bring a laser - like focus to improving customer service and ensuring that small businesses would be treated with the care and respect they deserved			0
his leave from the boardroom – officially a short break but already being interpreted as a permanent departure – means those ambitions have been thwarted for the time being			0
his temporary successor , finance boss @entity48 , will need to concentrate on steadying the ship and controlling the panic in the shares rather than overhauling and improving the business model			2
the troubles at @entity5 are a parable of mishandling by government			1
@entity5 is @entity172 - like in its dominance of high street banking , with a 30 per cent share of retail operations as a result of the calamitous merger with @entity66 in the wake of the collapse of the @entity182 investment bank @entity181 in september 2008			1
the then prime minister @entity183 nodded the deal through without reference to the @entity186 , which polices bids that threaten customer choice			0
until that point @entity5 , run by the cautious @entity182 @entity64 , had taken a totally different path to that of its rivals on the high street			1
final straw : the financial crisis in @entity196 sent @entity5 ' shares tumbling instead of rushing into investments in @entity182 sub-prime mortgages and dodgy property lending , it had concentrated on serving the domestic consumer and business market			2
the conservatism of @entity5 made it a very popular share with private investors ( including this writer ) and its stock was famous for offering a dividend interest rate yield far better than anything that could be obtained in the savings accounts offered by its branches			2
the @entity66 takeover changed the group			0
it provided @entity215 with a dominant role on the high street through @entity81 and its offshoots but it also brought with it @entity122 , which had become a favourite lender to every business spiv that knocked on its door			0
' the big question now is whether the star banker will ever be robust enough for the challenges ahead ' the enormous mistakes made by @entity66 meant that when the banks were required to strengthen their balance sheets in october 2008 the enlarged @entity5 accepted £ 20billion of cash from the government , which grabbed a 40 per cent share of the enlarged bank in exchange			2
when he arrived , the new @entity15 chief executive had a huge legacy of problems to deal with			0
what he found most difficult , however , was running a publicly quoted company in the full glare of the media			0
in his previous job , as the boss of the @entity13 subsidiary of the @entity55 bank , he was not exposed to the same pressures			2
by all accounts he found the constant juggling of different interest groups very trying			0
he needed to deal with the government , the @entity249 , @entity250 ( the holder of the government ’s 40pc stake ) , the @entity255 shareholders and a vast workforce			0
and behind the steely façade and handsome head of slicked back hair mr @entity8 was struggling			2
the final straw was the financial crisis in @entity196 , which sent @entity5 ’ shares tumbling			2
the quick exit from the heavy hand of government ownership has looked impossible as the shares have tanked			0
the big question for @entity5 chairman sir @entity268 now is whether his chosen star banker will ever be robust enough for the tremendous challenges ahead .			2

@entity8 became @entity5 boss in march
he is thought to be suffering from fatigue
