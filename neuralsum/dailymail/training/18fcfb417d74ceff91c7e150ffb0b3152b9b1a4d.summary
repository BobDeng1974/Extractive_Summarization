@entity0 are back in the title race @entity2 let themselves down with their set - pieces against @entity4 @entity5 can become a @entity7 legend @entity4 ’s £ 200million state - of - the - art @entity8 opened this week to a flood of questions about whether they will succeed in producing any homegrown players , and more specifically will they develop any young players who will go on to play for @entity14			1
when @entity16 left in the summer it felt like a part of @entity4 ’s soul was dying			2
let ’s remember this is a club with a proud history of producing its own players			1
the @entity24 - winning side of 1986 has a special place in the hearts of @entity4 fans , with players like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 all progressing to the first team			1
@entity29 and @entity35 all went on to play for @entity14 , while the brilliant @entity32 was in @entity59 ’s provisional 30 - man squad for the @entity60 , before injuries curtailed his career			0
those were special times for @entity4 fans who , like supporters of most clubs , love to see a young , local player come through the system and play for the first team			1
on opening this new academy , @entity4 have set themselves a target of producing four to six homegrown players for the first team			1
and the sceptics are questioning whether that will ever happen			0
who the hell do these sceptics think they are ? a map of the new @entity77 , which has been built just over the road from the @entity79 there are three gyms at @entity4 's new complex , with one featuring the giant slogan ' create the future ' on the wall the training complex is linked to the club 's @entity79 by a long bridge that straddles @entity89 @entity32 ( left ) celebrates @entity4 's famous 5 - 1 victory over local rivals @entity0 with @entity92 back in 1989 @entity93 has sanctioned not just a huge fortune on the building of this academy for @entity4			1
he has demanded the very best facilities – there is a room in this building where at the push of a button conditions can be replicated from anywhere in the world at any time of year			0
he is providing young hopefuls with the best conditions to succeed , and the best chance of getting a decent education while they ’re chasing the football dream			0
perhaps even more importantly the @entity93 ’s money is regenerating part of east @entity56 and reducing unemployment with 70 per cent of the workforce taken on since the project 's inception drawn from the local area , and 10 per cent of the staff previously unemployed			1
@entity93 's vision for @entity4 is being realised , and his quote from six years ago is emblazoned on the entrance to the @entity123 it is a massive boost for football in @entity56 , and for the economy of the area			1
it ’s not the @entity8 responsible , and it ’s not the government			2
it ’s a man from the @entity131			0
so instead of posing hypothetical questions about how many homegrown players will be in @entity4 ’s first team in five years time , people should say thanks to @entity137 for what he ’s given to @entity4 and to the city of @entity56			1
@entity140 have set themselves a target they know some will judge them on – @entity143 do the same			0
their policy every year is to try to produce three players for their first team , three good enough for the @entity144 , and three good enough to be professionals lower down the ladder			2
if that does n’t happen have they failed ? no of course not			0
instead of hypothetical questions , people should thank @entity137 for what he 's given to the @entity56 - including the @entity158 title , clinched by @entity159 in 2012 same applies to @entity4			1
as an owner , @entity93 can not be faulted			2
as a club , @entity4 are getting so many things right			2
they have the ambition to produce players for the first team , and if it happens some of them will be @entity168			0
cynics want to knock it down already			0
i ’m too busy admiring a club and an owner trying to make @entity168 football and @entity168 society better .			0

@entity4 opened a new £ 200m @entity8 this week
questions raised over whether @entity4 will produce homegrown stars
@entity4 have a proud history of producing young players
people should thank @entity93 for what he 's given to @entity4
