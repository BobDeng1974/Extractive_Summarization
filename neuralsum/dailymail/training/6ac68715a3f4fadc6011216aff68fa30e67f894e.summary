by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 17 march 2013 the last of the @entity1 has spoken for the first time how he celebrated the squadron 's heroic raid - with a nice cup of tea			2
almost 70 years after the night - time bombing attacks , squadron leader @entity8 , 91 , told of the daring raid over occupied territory that dealt a decisive blow that crippled the @entity14 war effort			1
@entity8 was festooned with a raft of medals including a @entity17 for his part in @entity1 's daring 1943 blitz on the @entity14 - controlled dams along the @entity21 in @entity22 , destroying their hydro - electric source of power			1
the last @entity25 : squadron leader @entity26 , 91 , at home in @entity28 with his many medals the @entity1 : ( @entity30 ) @entity26 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , front gunner , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , flight engineer and @entity39 @entity8 , who lives in @entity28 , was a sergeant at the time of the raids , conducted under the name @entity42 , which smashed the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 dams			1
he said : ' we were about half an hour late because our plane had a hydraulic leak and we had to swap			0
' we took off at 22.01 , and flew in over @entity46 in brilliant moonlight			1
we had to get the aim right - we went in six or seven times and i 'd shout ' @entity55 '			0
married bliss : @entity26 with his wife @entity57 on their wedding day 3rd april 1943 ' it was a totally different dam from the other dams			2
it was impossible to fly low over , so it had to be a drop , not a spinning bomb			0
' piloted by @entity35 , the plane nicknamed ' @entity67 ' was one of five planes that made it to the dam , which was the most difficult of the three targets to crack			0
it took bombardier @entity8 and his crew nine attempts to fly at a perilous 30ft , before the bomb , codenamed @entity77 , was finally loosed , seconds before they had to pull up to avoid smashing into the hillside behind the dam			1
he said : ' i could see where to drop and shouted ' @entity83 ' to cheers of ' thank @entity85 ' from the crew who were yelling for me to get the bomb out			0
' at 00.46 on may 17 we dropped our bomb with 8,500lb of explosives			0
' @entity8 added : ' there was a spout of water 1,000ft high			1
we circled and the dam crumbled about 10yards wide			0
' but it did n't seem as if the other five aircraft had been there			0
we needed six bombs to crack the dam and the water would do the rest			0
' after smashing the dam , the heroic airmen flew their @entity106 bomber over the @entity107 , which has been blown by another plane in the same daring raid			1
the @entity46 dam was badly damaged by the daring night - time raid , orchestrated by wing commander @entity112 and bouncing bomb inventor @entity113			1
@entity8 said : ' i will never forget the sight			1
it was like an inland sea with all that water overflowing			0
' it gave us a lot of satisfaction when we heard over the radio that the @entity47 had been breached as well			2
' the whole crew : all of the @entity25 raid crews , @entity26 is top 2nd from left hero : @entity26 describes the difficulties he experienced that day and the effect the loss of his friends had it was only when they flew back to @entity136 in @entity137 that the brave crew realised they had been hit several times by an armoured train on their way to the dams , and the pilot 's chair was pockmarked with bullet holes			1
he said : ' i was tired and exhausted - i went to the mess and had bacon and powdered scrambled egg and a cup of tea			0
' the five - hour raid came at a heavy price - 53 of the 133 brave airmen , hand - picked for the secret mission , did not come home			1
@entity8 said : ' the waitresses in the sergeants ' mess were all in tears as so many places were empty			2
' the brave airman married sweetheart @entity166 , a phone operator in the women 's royal @entity168 , days before the sortie , after being given special permission from chiefs despite all leave being cancelled			0
then and now : a dapper mr @entity8 ( left ) in his youth , and him now ( right ) with his medals after narrowly avoiding death on an eye - watering 50 missions during his 22 years ' service with the @entity180 , @entity8 became a teacher			1
great - grandfather @entity8 , who became a widower when @entity166 died of cancer in 2005 , is helping @entity185 filmmaker @entity184 with his scheduled remake of the classic 1955 @entity188 film			2
he said : ' i feel honoured and proud to have been lucky enough to take part in that raid			0
' it proved to @entity193 and the @entity22 what they thought was impregnable could be destroyed by the @entity180			2

@entity197 ' @entity8 was a sergeant during the raid
