by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s atmospheric carbon dioxide has remained remarkably stable over the past 24 million years			2
and scientists believe they have now solved part of the mystery as to why this has been the case , despite changing geological conditions			1
they believe that ancient tree roots in the mountains may play an important role in controlling long - term global temperatures acting as a type of natural ‘ thermostat ’			0
researchers at @entity15 and @entity16 carried out studies in tropical rain forests in @entity19 and found that mountainous forest may play a particularly important role			0
this is the valley in the @entity23 where fine root growth and organic layer thickness were measured over several years when co2 levels became too low for plants to grow properly , forests in mountains appear to have kept the climate in check by slowing down the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere			1
‘ this study shows how trees can act as brakes on extreme climate change , and the roots of trees in tropical mountains such as the @entity23 play a disproportionate role , ' @entity35 , professor of @entity36 at @entity15 told @entity45			2
' however , these responses take thousands to millions of years and can not do much to slow the rate of global warming we are experiencing this century			0
’ in a warmer world , tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil , breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide in a warmer world , tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil , breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide			1
this process , called weathering , draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and cools the planet			2
the researchers say this theory suggests that mountainous ecosystems have acted like the @entity2 's thermostat , addressing the risk of ' catastrophic ' overheating or cooling over millions of years			1
researchers from @entity15 and @entity16 discovered that temperatures affect the thickness of the leaf litter and organic soil layers , as well as the rate at which the tree roots grow			1
in a warmer world , this means that tree roots are more likely to grow into the mineral layer of the soil , breaking down rock which will eventually combine with carbon dioxide			1
this process , called weathering , draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and cools the planet			2
the theory suggests that mountainous ecosystems have acted like the @entity2 's thermostat , addressing the risk of ' catastrophic ' overheating or cooling over millions of years			1
in their research paper , published online in @entity89 , the researchers carried out studies in tropical rain forests in @entity19			0
they measured growth of the tree roots across different sites of varying altitude - from the warm @entity96 to the cooler mountain ranges of the @entity23 - every three months over several years			2
at each of the sites , they also measured the thickness of the organic layer above the soil			0
this information was then combined with data of monthly temperature , humidity , rainfall , and soil moisture to calculate the likely breakdown process of the basalt and granite rocks found in the mountain ranges of @entity19			0
using this model , scientists were able to scale up their results to calculate the likely contribution of mountain forests worldwide to global weathering rates			0
researchers measured growth of the tree roots across different sites of varying altitude - from the warm @entity96 to the cooler mountain ranges of the @entity126 ( pictured ) - every three months over several years the researchers then calculated the likely amount of carbon to be pulled out of the atmosphere through weathering when the @entity2 became very hot			1
they looked at the volcanic eruptions in @entity131 65 million years ago , known as the @entity133 traps			0
the model also allowed them to calculate the weathering process and carbon feedback after the @entity2 's cooling 45 million years ago , when great mountain ranges like the @entity23 and the @entity139 were first formed			1
the paper suggests that mountainous regions may play a particularly important role in drawing carbon out of the atmosphere because they have abundant volcanic rock which is highly reactive to weathering when it disintegrates			0
at each of the sites in the @entity149 of @entity19 , researchers also measured the thickness of the organic layer above the soil ' this is a simple process driven by tree root growth and the decomposition of organic material , ’ said lead researcher @entity157 , from @entity15			1
‘ yet it may contribute to @entity2 's long - term climate stability			1
it seems to act like a thermostat , drawing more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere when it is warm and less when it is cooler			0
’ ' a series of climatic events over the last 65 million years ago have resulted in global temperatures rising and falling			0
‘ however , the weathering process that regulates carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may be buffered by forests that grow in mountainous parts of the world			2
‘ in the past , this natural process may have prevented the planet from reaching temperatures that are catastrophic for life			0

study found climate affects thickness of soil layers and rate of root growth
in a warm world , this means roots would grow into mineral layer of soil
this process draws co2 out of the atmosphere and cools the planet
theory suggests mountainous ecosystems react to changing geological conditions and stabilise @entity2 's co2 levels
