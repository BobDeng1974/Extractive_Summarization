up to half of @entity2 's big trees have disappeared in the past 90 years , according to a new study , which claims that decreases in water brought about by climate change may be to blame			1
scientists from the @entity8 and others compared forest surveys from the 1920s and 30s with recent @entity13 data and found that there had been a huge decrease in the density of large trees in the state			1
@entity2 is famous for its giant redwoods , pine and oak trees but smaller trees are becoming increasingly common in the state			1
up to half of @entity2 's big trees have disappeared in the past 90 years , according to a new study			1
pictured is the state 's ' @entity26 ' ' older , larger trees are declining because of disease , drought , logging and other factors , but what stands out is that this decline is statewide , ' said study leader @entity35			2
' forests are becoming dominated by smaller , more densely packed trees , and oaks are becoming more dominant as pines decline			0
' the authors , which include scientists from @entity43 and the @entity44 , found that the density of large trees declined in all regions of @entity2 , with declines of up to 50 per cent in the @entity50 highlands , the south and central coast ranges and northern @entity2			2
they believe that water deficit , which is linked to climate change , may be a factor in the demise of the state 's imposing trees			1
@entity2 is famous for its giant redwoods - such as @entity60 , the third largest recorded tree by volume in the world - pine and oak trees , but smaller trees are becoming increasingly common a picture taken in 1940 of a redwood tree in @entity2 that 's had a road cut through it ' based on our data , water stress helps to explain the decline of large trees , ' @entity70 said			1
' areas experiencing declines in large - tree density also experienced increased water stress since the 1930s			0
' co-author @entity80 , a professor of integrative biology , said that stressed forests and the loss of large trees could exacerbate the global carbon situation , especially since many are hoping that forests will soak up more and more fossil fuel emissions			0
' there 's no question that if you are losing large trees , you are losing the standing carbon in the forest , ' he said			0
' loss of these big trees and the impact of drought stress become a big concern going forward in terms of its impact on the carbon cycle ; they can turn a carbon sink into a source of carbon released to the atmosphere			2
' the results , the authors say , may help forecast future forest responses to climate change , and in particular suggest that increased temperatures and changing water availability may lead to large - scale changes in forest composition throughout western @entity114			1
redwood trees , which are native to @entity2 's @entity50 , are the world 's largest by volume reaching heights of 274.9 feet ( 84.2 metres ) and a ground level girth of 109 feet ( 33 metres )			2
the oldest known @entity120 based on its ring count is 3,500 years old			0
the study was published in the @entity123			0
at an exhibtion in @entity125 , a trunk slice of a huge @entity120 tree was exhibited , measuring 4 meters in diameter			0
it stems from a tree 1,510 years old			0

scientists from @entity8 *reveal* huge decline in big trees
@entity2 is famous for its giant redwoods , but small trees on increase
water deficit , linked to climate change , may be a factor in change
