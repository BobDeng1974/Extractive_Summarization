despite the best efforts of @entity1 and co , style , says photographer @entity4 , is about much more than owning the latest trainers or an expensive suit			1
instead , he says , it 's all about expression and staying true to yourself			0
if that sounds baffling , then the street style specialist 's new book , @entity10 , ought to help			0
packed with glossy photos of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 's most stylish men , the dapper gents pictured have little in common with @entity1 and his wardrobe of garish @entity22			1
others are dapper in classic homburg hats and trench coats , neat striped blazers and cream chinos and even , in one case , manage to breathe new life into the well - worn pale blue shirt and jeans combo			0
there 's little to tie the men together , apart , that is , from confidence			0
' the main thing that catches my eye when i ’m out taking photos is confidence , ' adds @entity4			2
' it ’s in how someone holds themselves when they think nobody is looking			0
if you got that , you ’ll stand out on the street , even if you ’re not trying to			0
' time for a makeover : @entity1 's blingy approach to dressing is proof that money ca n't buy style makeover : the traditional jeans and cotton shirt combo is given an overhaul by this pair of dapper gents but style , of the fashionable kind , is something that @entity4 knows well			1
born in @entity84 , the photographer and art director lived in @entity20 before moving to @entity16 and has worked on campaigns for @entity86 and @entity87 , as well as on editorial features for @entity89 and many more			1
as a result , he 's got a few style ideas of his own although they do boil down into one key commandment : wear what you love			0
' do n’t follow the trends too much , ' he adds , wisely			2
' if you do , have fun with them but add something unique to the look that express ’ something about you			0
' with such emphasis on individuality , it 's no surprise that one of his favourite cities to snap is @entity17 , where , in trendy areas such as @entity110 , locals can be seen wearing anything from silver skirts to skinny jeans			2
tailoring : as these gentlemen demonstrate , the classic pale chino and blazer combination never gets dull urban cool : the tailored trouser gets a gritty makeover ( left ) and a masterclass in wearing colour ( right ) ' i loved shooting the streets of @entity17 , ' he enthuses			1
' i love the sense of tradition yet done with such a modern spin			1
@entity17 men are very much into what ’s going on in fashion and stay on top of it			1
' that does n't mean , however , that he does n't love the scene in @entity16 and @entity20			1
' men ’s style is @entity16 is very eclectic , ' he muses			1
' it ’s a city where men on the mainstream are finally starting to experiment with fashion			0
it ’s a time of experimentation and trying new things , which is leading to some flamboyant looks			0
' and @entity20 ? @entity20 , he says , is both fun and trend focused			2
' the men of @entity20 have the most fun with fashion i think			2
' it ’s where trends appear on the streets , resulting in a more urban and cool look			0
@entity20 is the land of big box stores but the guys know how to make their style unique			2
' men in this @entity163 by @entity4 ( @entity164 , £ 12.99 ) is published on the 15th september stylish : author and photographer @entity4 ( left ) knows a thing or two about style himself			1
