’ he added : ‘ in the end , i have a big cause that i am fighting for and it is a tough fight , but i am determined that we win this fight			0
‘ i did n’t take this job because i thought it would be a walk in the park , i fought for this job because i thought it was important and i thought i had something distinctive to say about how we can change this country			0
‘ i relish the next ten months , i relish the opportunity to fight for my vision for the country			0
