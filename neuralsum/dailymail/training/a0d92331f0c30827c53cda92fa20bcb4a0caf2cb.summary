a @entity1 scientist believes a remote @entity3 rock formation may be the first place that humanity began to follow the movements of the heavens			1
@entity8 , known as the @entity9 , is a series of eight sandstone outcrops on a remote flood plain on the bank of the @entity15 river in the republic of @entity17			2
professor @entity18 , of the @entity19 at the @entity20 , claims that the 16,000 - year - old site was not only a place of huge religious significance in the ancient world , but also its stargazing capital			1
dawn of astronomy : a @entity1 academic says the ' @entity28 ' could be man 's first attempt to monitor the heavens @entity32 : @entity8 is a series of eight box - shaped stones on the landscape of remote @entity3 each of the eight peaks are have stones like giant boxes or chests perched on top			1
the word ' @entity42 ' in @entity1 means ' chest ' or ' trunk ' which explains how the place got its modern name			1
' for many years i tried to unravel these mystery ' chests ' , said professor @entity18 , who became an ' astro - archeologist ' in his bid to unravel the site 's mysteries			2
' we do n't dig in the ground - we study what ancient people knew about astronomy ' , he said			2
' what i discovered was a surprise even to myself			2
comparing maps accumulated over many years of astronomical observations , i came to understand that here in @entity67 , we can see the oldest astronomical observatory , certainly in @entity69			1
by using a central point of reference , our ancestors could have used the landscape to mark the passage of the sun and moon time 's arrow : humans left archaeological evidence that they inhabited the region more than 16,000 years ago the ancient stargazers could have used giant rocks and chinks in the stone architecture for their calculations as well as the movement of the heavenly bodies , the mountains could have been used to align north and south historical treasure : archaeologists may uncover more exciting information from the site ' its age is about 16,000 years old			1
the ancient inhabitants of this valley daily observed the sunset , the sunrise and the moon '			2
yet the professor thinks these ancient @entity3 astronomers , without any instruments , used giant rocks and chinks in the stone architecture in the landscape for their calculations and observations			1
he claims to have found ' numerous ancient solar and lunar observatories around @entity8 '			1
speaking to the @entity112 , he said : ' this square pattern of stones on the ground shows you the place			2
' i knew there would be an orientation point , but we had to search through the grass for a long time to find it			1
' now look up to the top of that ridge			0
you see a place where there is a crack between the rocks ? ' if you were here on the summer solstice , you would see the sun rise right there			0
or you would if you were here 2,000 years so			0
now the timing is slightly different '			0
high on one cliff wall is a rock engraving showing dragon heads pointing in one direction , and snake heads the other , something ancient people would have used to tell the time by using the sun. professor @entity18 added : ' in the morning the shadow moves along the snake 's body from his head to his tail , and in the afternoon it comes from the other direction along the dragon			1
' from the same observation point you can determine true north and south by sighting along the mountains			0
' there is also rock art at the site and a mysterious white horse symbol found not far from the first ' chest ' may have appeared 16,000 years ago , during the @entity163			1
but the site has not yielded all its mysteries			0
there are also burial mounds and other man - made constructions - including irrigation channels - which have yet to be fully explored by archaeologists			0
remnant : this horse drawing is believed to be 16,000 years old professor @entity18 believes @entity8 is the oldest astronomical observatory certainly in @entity69 and perhaps the world ancient observatories were far more than just ways of measuring time and following the paths of heavenly bodies			1
anthropologists claim the sites would have combined many aspects of what the ancients believed and how they saw the @entity185 well as observatories , they may have been used as tombs , temples and even homes			0
here are some of the most famous			0
the @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity193 tower in this @entity194 city - built around 1460 - has a stone that is lit up as the sun shines through one window on the june solstice			0
around the same time , this window also frames @entity202 star cluster , which was used by the @entity194 to decide when to plant potatoes			1
@entity204 , chinathe country 's oldest surviving observatory was built in @entity207 around 1276 by renowned @entity209 astronomer and engineer @entity210			1
it was used for time - keeping and mapping the stars			2
astronomers there calculated the length of the year to within 26 seconds - three centuries before @entity217 managed it			0
@entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 a @entity222 monument believed to be 2,000 years old			0
the line between the central stone and one peripheral cairn points to sunrise on the summer solstice and three cairns line up with the dawn rise of the stars @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 , @entity234 in around 3100 @entity235 , the monument was first used as a burial site			0
on the @entity238 at dawn , the sun rises over a ' heelstone ' , as viewed from the middle of the monument			0
scientists think @entity243 and @entity244 cultures saw some kind of sacred significance in the solstice source : @entity249			0

*sunduki* in @entity3 may be oldest human observatory in history
@entity1 scientist claims to have found evidence of crude solar *calendars*
@entity259 ' used landscape to record time '
