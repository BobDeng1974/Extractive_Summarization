look closely enough and you can still make out the prints on the bottom of his toes ... 2,500 years after he died			2
this is the near - perfectly preserved body of a 14 - year - old @entity8 boy named @entity9 , revealed for the first time since he was unearthed in the 1920s , entombed within a lavishly - decorated sarcophagus			1
the son of a powerful stolist priest , he is still wrapped in the embalming cloth - now yellowish , dusty rags - in which his corpse was swaddled some 500 years before the birth of @entity19			1
the trouble , however , is that his body has lain still for so long that it is impossible to unwrap the gold - painted shroud covering his face , for fear it may crumble instantly into dust			2
once the lid was off the wooden coffin containing his remains , scientist @entity54 could relax			0
the conservator at @entity60 's @entity59 and three other scientists had just used clamps and pieces of metal to create a kind of cradle to lift the fragile lid			1
wearing blue surgical gloves , they slowly lifted the contraption containing the coffin lid and carefully walked it to a table in a humidity - controlled lab at the museum			2
' @entity75 ! ' @entity54 said , after helping set the lid down			0
he later added : ' oh yeah , god , i was nervous			0
' the well - planned routine came on friday as scientists started conservation work on the mummy of @entity82 , the 14 - year - old son of a stolist priest			1
the mummy needs to be stabilized so it can travel in the upcoming exhibit , ' mummies : images of the @entity89 , ' which is expected to premier next september at the @entity90 of @entity91			1
it is expected to travel to the @entity93 in fall 2016			2
relief : scientist @entity95 and three colleagues used clamps and pieces of metal to create a kind of cradle to lift the fragile lid at @entity60 's @entity59			1
markings on the coffin showed that , if @entity9 had lived , he would have been a priest like his father			1
scientists do n't know why he died so young delicate : wearing blue surgical gloves , they slowly lifted the contraption containing the coffin lid and carefully walked it to a table in a humidity - controlled lab at the museum @entity59 has had the mummy since the 1920s , when the institution received it from the @entity117			1
it 's part of the museum 's collection of 30 complete human mummies from @entity8			1
' there 's always a risk of damage , ' said @entity54 , who did the work in a lab filled with plastic - covered examination tables set behind a large window to let schoolchildren watch his daily work			2
' so we like to handle these things as little as possible			0
' inside the coffin , known as a sarcophagus , there was expected damage			0
ct scans , which make x-ray images that allow scientists to see inside the coffin before opening it , showed the boy 's feet were detached and partially unwrapped with his toes sticking out			1
his shroud and mask were torn and twisted sideways			0
those also will be repaired			0
artifact : @entity59 has had the mummy since the 1920s , when the institution received it from the @entity117			1
it 's part of the museum 's collection of 30 complete human mummies from @entity8 confident : @entity54 did n't worry that the mummy would scatter to dust when opened - something common in the movies			1
pieces of the coffin had previously gone missing , exposing the mummy to the elements technology : ct scans , which make x-ray images that allow scientists to see inside the coffin before opening , prepared scientists for the damage already done to the remains @entity54 did n't worry that the mummy would scatter to dust when opened - something common in the movies - so long as he is kept wrapped in linen			1
pieces of the coffin had previously gone missing , exposing the mummy to the elements			0
' the last bit of " @entity180 " and all that , ' @entity54 explained before opening the coffin			0
' that 's not going to happen			2
' and it did n't			0
walking around the opened coffin , @entity54 pointed and explained the significance of a certain marking , the colored resin on the linen wrappings or the gilded gold on the mask			2
if @entity9 had lived , he would have been a priest like his father , @entity54 said			1
scientists do n't know why he died so young			0
' the fascinating thing about any mummy is that it 's survived as long as it has , ' @entity54 said			0
' they 're actually amazingly fragile			0
' ' this kind of work is always painstaking , filled with pre-planning and tests so scientists are prepared for the unexpected , ' said @entity203 , who works with mummies as project conservator at @entity206 's ' in the @entity207 : conserving @entity8 mummies ' exhibition in @entity210			1
' these are unique individuals , unique objects , ' she said			0
' there 's nothing else like them			0
if damage were to happen , we ca n't put things back together exactly the way they were before			0
