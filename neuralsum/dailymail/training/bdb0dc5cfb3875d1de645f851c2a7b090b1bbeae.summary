blood was streaming down my face , it was just pouring out			0

' you could have stuck your little finger through my cheek , i could n't believe it when i looked in the mirror , i was a mess			1
' it frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening			2
i have n't even met them yet - i do n't want to be bruised and battered in their first photograph with me ' , he said			2
