the finish to the final stage of the @entity2 here in @entity4 proved fairly predictable			1
with @entity6 already out of the race with injury , it was left to the powerfully built @entity9 , the imperious @entity10 , to burst away from the peloton for the second time in three days to secure victory on @entity13			1
just across to where the team vehicles were gathered on @entity17 , however , it was rather more chaotic			1
emergency repair works on the @entity19 had the 22 teams in something of a panic - the riders might have been flying to @entity24 on monday night but talk of ‘ six hour delays ’ had them concerned their bikes might be delayed - while sir @entity28 had a public relations issue to deal with			2
scroll down for highlights leader : @entity9 's @entity10 crosses the finish line to win the third stage of the @entity2 battle : the @entity36 team rider sprints to win the 155km third stage of the @entity2 form : @entity38 has now won two of the three 2014 @entity2 stages controversy : @entity41 's sir @entity28 caused a stir by saying he wanted to help a @entity24 win a tour success : @entity41 's team principal @entity28 ( left ) delivered @entity46 to @entity2 glory in 2013 home grown : he also brought @entity51 's first ever @entity2 winner by guiding sir @entity52 to glory in 2012 outward looking : @entity28 said it 'd be great to deliver a @entity24 to victory in their home race winner : supporters wave along the road as @entity9 's @entity10 ( centre ) , wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey @entity63 : @entity65 - @entity64 ( left ) and @entity66 led the way as the pack cycled through @entity69 @entity38 claims second win in @entity69 earlier on @entity41 ’s team principal had been quoted in a @entity24 newspaper interview stating that it was his intention to deliver a first @entity24 winner of the @entity2 in more than 30 years			1
the @entity24 would certainly appreciate it , given it has not been since @entity77 in 1985 that they saw one of their own in yellow on the @entity83			2
but surely it is n’t the job of @entity88 @entity87 cycling , indeed the man who until april was also performance director of the @entity87 squad , to end that particular wait			2
after masterminding @entity51 ’s @entity93 cycling success , @entity28 created a ‘ @entity87 ’ pro team at @entity41 with the sole intention of delivering a first @entity97 winner			2
it was central to his mission statement at the launch of @entity41 in february 2009 and something he duly delivered with sir @entity52 in 2012 and then followed with @entity46 last year			2
but in an interview with the @entity24 sports daily , @entity104 , @entity28 said : ‘ yes , i would like to win with a @entity24 rider			2
‘ i think it needs to happen			0
for the @entity2 , for @entity24 , for the @entity24 , for the sport , having a @entity24 winner would be massive			1
’ a fluent @entity24 speaker , @entity110 may be guilty of nothing more than trying to please his audience the day before the @entity2 rolls into @entity24			1
busy street : the @entity2 began it 's third stage from @entity117 on monday friendly : yellow jersey holder @entity119 ( centre ) of @entity122 greets @entity123 ( left ) before the race popular : a supporter holds a @entity127 national flag reading @entity51 's @entity128 in front of @entity130 but after welcoming his riders back to the team bus he insisted delivering @entity87 winners remained his priority			1
‘ let ’s clear that up right now , ’ he said			0
‘ my focus is on doing everything i can to support @entity41 riders to be on the podium and to help @entity46 to win this race			0
‘ the comment was more about a national event , if it ’s won by the same nation ’s rider , what a fantastic thing that can be			1
’ he then agreed it was ‘ tremendously important ’ to have a @entity87 rider leading @entity41 ’s challenge			0
‘ with @entity46 , we ’ve got a fantastic lead rider , and we see other young @entity87 riders developing as well , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve worked for 15 years to try to put @entity156 on the map and i hope to continue to do that			0
’ that said , he did apply a touch of realism to the situation			0
‘ there are only five or six guys in the world who can win the tour , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a @entity87 team with a @entity87 heart , but the team has become more global , there ’s no doubt about it			0
’ here we go : the pack of riders in action during the third stage of the 101st edition of the @entity2 last leg : @entity2 fans gather outside the @entity182 as the sun shines in @entity69 cycle this way : cycling fans wait in the village of @entity187 in north @entity188 for the @entity2 to arrive to maintain that @entity87 heart @entity28 said attempts were being made to extend @entity192 ’ contract with @entity41 until the @entity193 in 2016 , even though he was not selected for this tour			1
‘ we 'd like him to continue with us , ’ he said			0
but reports also persist of @entity41 ’s pursuit of the promising @entity24 rider , @entity199			0
@entity28 said he rather hoped to see the @entity2 return to these shores after a brilliant three days ’ racing , even if @entity69 ’s weather proved somewhat damper than the sunshine the riders enjoyed on the @entity205			1
@entity206 nevertheless estimated that a million people had lined the streets of the capital alone to see @entity36 deliver @entity38 to perfection after 155km of racing from @entity117			1
so determined is welcome to @entity205 chief executive @entity210 to have the race back there he has already compiled a dossier outlining how it could be even better next time			0
spectators who step into the road to take photographs - sometimes even ‘ selfies ’ – remained an issue on stage three			1
one man who appeared to be taking a picture forced crowded : fans gather around @entity130 as they await the @entity2 stars in @entity69 @entity224 : cycling fans make their mark on the third stage @entity2 route before the cyclists ride through @entity188 @entity41 ’s @entity230 to swerve wildly with four other riders crashing as a result			1
among them was the unfortunate @entity233 , who was the victim of @entity6 ’s error on saturday			0
@entity46 avoided any such issues , however , finishing safely in the pack and remaining just two seconds adrift of race leader @entity119 .			0

@entity10 wins stage three of the @entity2 from @entity117 to @entity69
@entity9 sprinter has now won two of the three stages
