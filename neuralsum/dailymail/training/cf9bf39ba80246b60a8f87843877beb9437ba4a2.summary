by @entity0 @entity1 remains optimistic about @entity4 's @entity3 qualification prospects despite the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity6 in @entity7 on sunday night			1
the @entity9 winners dominated the first - half and were more than worthy of their 1 - 0 interval lead thanks to a @entity13 header			2
@entity15 's side , however , came out energised and purposeful after the break and deservedly levelled in the 66th minute through wide - man @entity17 to send the thousands of @entity19 foot soldiers inside the impressive @entity20 into raptures			1
optimistic : @entity1 was encouraged by @entity4 's 2 - 0 loss to world champions @entity6 that joy was short - lived , however , when @entity13 soon restored the home side 's lead as he took advantage of slack defending in the @entity30 ' penalty area to slam the ball high into the net from close range			1
@entity4 skipper @entity1 was disappointed to be replaced by @entity34 before the equaliser , saying , ' the manager made the changes			1
he 's got players who have performed for him in the past and he felt like he needed a change and it obviously worked because we came into the game a lot more			0
' indeed , @entity1 saw enough both on and off the park after the break to give him hope ahead of the visit of @entity49 to @entity50 next month and for the rest of the @entity53 campaign			2
' we went there and showed we can compete and if we take that performance into other games then i am sure we will be fine ' , said the @entity59 midfielder			1
' we ca n't be disheartened , we knew that would be the most difficult game in the group so let 's try to get some points on the board going forward			0
' we changed the formation a little bit at half - time			0
@entity6 tired and we made a few chances			0
heads up : both @entity6 's goals were scored by @entity71 forward @entity13 ( @entity73 ) ' we believed in ourselves a bit more			2
you are always worried about attacking and leaving gaps but i thought the boys did fantastically well and we played some good stuff in the second half			0
' we knew it was going to be difficult but it was hard to take because there were spells when we played well and created some really good chances			0
' if few people believed @entity4 had any chance of beating the world champions on their own patch , expectation will be different when @entity49 , who lost their opener 2 - 1 at home to the @entity94 , visit @entity95			1
sub way : @entity59 midfielder was disappointed at being replaced by @entity34 @entity1 , however , refused to accept that match day two in the campaign falls into the must - win category			1
' we want to win all our home games , ' he said			0
' that 's the plan in qualifying , to pick up points away from home and win your home games			0
' i do n't know if it is must win yet ( against @entity49 ) but it 's important that we get three points on the board as quickly as possible			2

@entity4 were defeated 2 - 1 by @entity6 in opening @entity116 qualifier
@entity1 remains optimistic they will reach the *tournament*
