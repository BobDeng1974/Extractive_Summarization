' it ’s not my words			0
they are facts and evidence from those files			0
' @entity46 took his secrets to the grave when he hurled himself under a train just hours after @entity4 escaped while he was making a phone call			1

now @entity4 ’s father is expecting the @entity21 report to strengthen his civil case against @entity34			1
' what @entity3 has said all along and what he says in the book is that the police always knew someone else was involved , ' explained one family friend			2
' the first time they investigated , the police were lazy and incompetent			0
' then when she escaped they covered it up because it was too scandalous to admit			0
' now he hopes the truth will finally be dragged kicking and screaming into the daylight			0
@entity3 said : ' the @entity21 report ca n’t come to any conclusion other than the fact that there was massive interference and errors in the case			2
' i ca n’t do more than i have			0
but win or lose , i will have made sure that the information i have has been recorded for the history books - where the ultimate judgement will take place			0

@entity34 claims what @entity3 says is a conspiracy theory and produced a suicide note from his dead friend to prove it			1
a police expert , however , claims that the suicide note could not have been written by @entity46 - and more - that it had actually been written by @entity34			1
when police finally tracked @entity34 down on the day of @entity4 ’s escape , they said he started to sweat and appeared nervous			1
he then asked : ' has he killed her ? ' before police told him why they were there			0
and @entity3 says that , although @entity34 claims he did not know @entity4 other than seeing her once when his friend came to borrow a trailer , they spoke 100 times on the phone after her escape and @entity34 's wife made her a pink 18th birthday cake while she was in captivity			1
@entity4 told her sisters he had even given her a bottle of @entity190 as a birthday present while @entity34 ’s neighbour gave a statement to say he had seen @entity4 at his house			2
@entity3 ’s lawyer @entity195 said : ' we aim to prove [ @entity52 ] was involved , and even if the court do n’t accept that then we believe they have to accept that he must have known she was a victim of @entity46			2
