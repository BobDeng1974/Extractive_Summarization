but one teacher has found a novel way of getting his pupils attention			0
professor @entity2 starts all his lessons with comical introduction piece – and now his endeavors are causing a stir on @entity18			1
in the latest of his videos , the maths genius , who teaches at the @entity3 in @entity4 , piques the curiosity of students learning about imaginary numbers with an impressive display of computer wizardry			1
he creates a double of himself on a computer which appears on a white board behind his desk and then proceeds to chat to his imaginary self			2
his class burst into fits of giggles as his double asks him to stop interfering in the lesson , asks him to leave the room and tells him off when he tinkers with the microphone			0
the video has already amassed 17,000 @entity18 hits			1
mr @entity42 said : ' i like asking interesting questions or telling interesting stories but with a smaller class , it ’s easier to do tricks on them			0
' i upload my videos on @entity18 so my students can see them but then other people start looking at them			2
' other @entity18 viewers have criticized the video with one claiming that ' holding their attention does little if you do n’t teach anything during that time			2
' but another user has replied : ' clearly the lesson did not end where the video stopped , so do n’t be so quick to say this method of teaching did n’t help those students to understand the concept by actually making the lecture interesting			0
' @entity87 chasing : as mr @entity2 turns to his laptop a shadowy character runs across the screen is that me ? it seemed that mr @entity42 's shadow has a keen sense of humour and was happy to tease the teacher mr @entity2 teaches ' @entity98 ” where students learn about math ’s history before diving into understanding it			1
his other pranks on students include an @entity106 joke where the shadow on the blackboard behind him starts to act on its own , dancing and making rude gestures behind his back			0
in another , a @entity112 , which has more than a million @entity18 hits , the teacher appears to disappear behind a green screen			1
a ghostly double of him then appears and the pair cause some mischief , spraying water at the class while spooky music plays in the background			0
finally a terrifying image of a ghoul is blasted at the class with the message ' @entity127 ' terrifying the pupils who scream and laugh .			0
