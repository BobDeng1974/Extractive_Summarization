the former @entity10 man struck twice in the first half before adding a penalty after the break as the class gap between the two sides was ruthlessly emphasised			1

after taking a while to settle , the home side had an early chance to take the lead when @entity35 latched on to a hopeful through ball but he scuffed his shot and @entity38 comfortably gathered			0
at the other end @entity6 posed the occasional threat with @entity41 sending a header straight at @entity43 , but it came as little surprise when @entity3 struck after 12 minutes			2
@entity6 remain two points adrift at the bottom of the @entity8 table @entity48 threaded a delightful pass through a square @entity6 defence and @entity0 coolly slid the ball home for his sixth goal of the season			1
