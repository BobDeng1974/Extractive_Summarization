by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it has been called obscene , immoral and everything from a national scandal to a public disgrace			2
this is not @entity8 bigwigs being linked to paedophilia			0
nor is it war dossiers being sexed up so young @entity13 men and women could be sent to needless death and maiming by posturing politicians			0
and although it has to do with money , it is not related to greedy bankers stuffing their pockets while engineering a financial collapse which has left millions of impoverished , freezing pensioners with next to no interest on their hard - earned savings			1
now while this is an astonishing amount of money for anyone to be paid for kicking around a bladder full of wind , is it really such an outrage ? this wage is not being paid from our taxes			1
rather , it will generate a healthy sum for the @entity63			0
nor will it come from investors misled into subscribing to dodgy schemes by @entity68 fat cats			0
rooney - assuming he signs his four - and - a - half - years ( plus one ) contract , and it is hard to think of a reason why he should not - is being offered roughly a fifty grand a week rise by his current employers			1
@entity35 feel pressed to make this gesture because their team are struggling somewhat right now and they need to convince potential recruits that they are in the business of regaining their status in @entity85 , no matter the cost			1
there will be fans of the club aghast at their generosity to a young man who has already held @entity35 to ransom twice by threatening to take his talent elsewhere , like @entity93			1
surrounded by problems : @entity28 is a bright spark in a @entity35 team that is struggling under new boss @entity97 sign here : it is @entity35 's fans that make @entity28 's incredible new contract possible but the harsh reality is that if supporters do n’t like it they can stop buying their tickets			1
no - one can force them to go to @entity109			2
anyway , what most of them are hoping is that @entity28 is so grateful that he will drag @entity35 back to the top of the @entity114 and champions @entity115 by his golden boot - laces			1
elsewhere in the football world many are goggling at so much dosh			0
since this contract is being negotiated at the sensitive time when the @entity124 game has lost its finest ever player , the comparisons are acute			2
now there has been no greater admirer of sir @entity128 than myself			1
i grew up watching him play whenever i got the chance and then became privileged to know him and spend time in his modest , charming and courteous company			0
and , yes , at £ 14 a week ( £ 12 in a summer when there were no games so he could concentrate on being @entity140 ’s most famous plumber ) he like all his contemporaries was slavishly underpaid			1
but that is not @entity28 ’s fault			1
not even when you looks at figures like these : that £ 14 in the mid-to - late 1950s , when @entity128 was at his peak with @entity140 and @entity124 , would be worth £ 267 today			1
so by that measure @entity28 would expect £ 13,904 a year , not the £ 15.6million on the table			1
true gentleman , great footballer : sir @entity128 , who died last friday and is pictured here playing his last game for @entity140 in april 1960 , never earned more than £ 14 - a - week during his professional playing career never forgotten : @entity0 walks with sir @entity128 on the pitch at @entity156 in 2009 sir @entity128 ’s career earnings with @entity158 totalled less than two - thirds what @entity28 will take home in a week			1
and against the £ 194,656 ( plus win bonuses ) with which @entity128 ’s 14 years of uncomplaining one - club loyalty was rewarded , the 27 - year - old @entity28 stands to bank £ 85.8m if he lasts the next five - and - a - half years at @entity35			1
it needs to be remembered that @entity128 was a pioneering campaigner for the betterment of professional footballers and did not resent the phenomenal incomes of the modern player			1
and he among many would argue that high earnings are infinitely preferable to the old maximum wage			2
since football is very much part of the entertainment industry , there is no logical reason to differentiate between its own players and pop singers and film stars			1
and i for one believe @entity28 brings more pleasure to the world than @entity184			2
if the market rate is three hundred grand , so be it			0
entertainers : @entity28 is in the same industry as @entity184 , so their wages can be judged in comparison career - defining : @entity28 's magnificent overhead kick secured victory against @entity68 in 2011 cut it out : @entity28 and wife @entity194 were pictured at @entity195 last summer however , big money brings with it heavy responsibility			1
@entity28 should feel an obligation to move heaven and earth to revitalise @entity35 and bring the feelgood factor back to @entity109			1
his is an important club to both football and modern society and the fans who are frustrated at the moment are the very people who make this contract possible			2
he is now in what should be the prime years of his career and needs to perform accordingly , consistently			2
the supporters may very well be hoping that certain demands , as well as a hefty fortune , are in the small print			0
for example , as a young man who tends to put on weight , would it be too much to ask that he tips the scales at a match - ready poundage at least once a week			2
there might also be lifestyle conditions			0
like not zooming off to @entity224 for mini-breaks , severely rationing trips to nightclubs and remembering that what he needs to be doing most for the next few , crucial years is training hard , eating sensibly and sleeping a lot			0
if such restraints are being applied then perhaps sir @entity232 , as a @entity35 director now , has had something to do with it			1
certainly , as manager , he had no fear of reading the riot act to his best player			0
hopefully now , as he matures , @entity28 will realise that such discipline is as good for him as for his generous paymasters – and that it is time to deliver			2
@entity242 and @entity243 must blame themselves for @entity246 humblings @entity242 and @entity243 are football men to be respected but they did not distinguish themselves in @entity249 defeat this week			0
as first @entity68 and then @entity250 were beaten 2 - 0 at home by two of the mightiest clubs in @entity85 , they elected to blame the referees rather than search for reasons within themselves and their teams			0
@entity242 faces a touchline ban for accusing the @entity260 official of bias in favour of @entity263			0
gesture : @entity243 ( right ) accused @entity265 ( left ) of diving to win a penalty against @entity250 pointing the finger : @entity242 ( second right ) suggested that @entity260 referee @entity270 was impartial during @entity68 's @entity249 defeat against @entity263 on tuesday night sorry , it was a sending off			0
and sorry again , when @entity68 captain @entity274 admitted they gave their opponents too much respect he was right ... and his manager was wrong to send them out in such a negative formation and mindset			0
@entity243 will escape sanction for calling @entity281 ’s @entity265 a diver			0
but sorry , the @entity281 man was cut down by @entity250 ’s goalkeeper so it was a penalty - and in my view a sending off as well			0
self destruction : @entity289 's ( bottom ) clear foul on @entity291 deserved a red card @entity293 of blood : @entity296 's ( left ) foul on @entity265 was clear for all to see and also merited a sending - off now , playing against either @entity263 or @entity281 with only 10 men is a monstrous task but it was not the fault of the men with the whistle that @entity68 and @entity250 had to do just that			2
we know it hurts to be as good as out of the most important club football competition in the world in the round of the last 16			0
but sometimes it behoves managers to put their hands up and admit they have been beaten by superior opponents , not wave their arms accusingly on the touchline in pathetic impersonations of @entity316 as he takes off from the 10 - metre board .			0

@entity28 is set to seal new contract worth £ 300k per week
public outrage at @entity28 's *colossal* wage is *misguided*
the late sir @entity128 , who never earned more than £ 12 - a - week , was *grossly* underpaid during his career
@entity35 must pay @entity28 generously due to current struggles
footballers are entertainers and deserve wages akin to pop and film stars
