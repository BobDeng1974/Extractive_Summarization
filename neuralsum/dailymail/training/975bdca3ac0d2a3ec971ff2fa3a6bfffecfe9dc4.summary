the future looks bright for a dark corner of @entity2 which has been named one of the world 's best places to gaze at the night sky			1
a 370,000 - acre expanse of rural @entity8 has won coveted protected status , the largest to do so in @entity10 , in a backlash against the light pollution which thwarts stargazers in towns and cities			1
astronomers hope it will encourage a new wave of ' stargazing tourism ' to the zone , which skirts @entity21 and will be named the @entity22			0
in 2008 a team of dedicated volunteers opened of the @entity47 , one of the most modern in @entity35 charged with getting ordinary people excited about stargazing			0
astronomer royal for @entity2 sir @entity52 said : ' i 'd like to offer warm support to this development			0
it is a further boost for @entity57 and stargazing throughout @entity8			2
' all humans , everywhere in the world and throughout history , have looked up at the sky and wondered at it			2
this experience is now denied to most people , because of the background light in towns and cities			1
' the @entity70 - based @entity69 ( @entity71 ) granted the zone @entity74 status , the highest possible			1
breathtaking : stars in the @entity76 pictured in clear skies over the @entity79 observatory , @entity8 dedicated : volunteers built the @entity28 observatory , pictured , to celebrate and preserve the region 's clear skies such parks , which include @entity85 in the @entity70 , have stringent rules to halt the spread of light pollution including the promotion of sophisticated outdoor lighting to residents			1
