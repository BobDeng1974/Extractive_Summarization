by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 3 july 2012 this singed letter addressed to @entity2 bears @entity4 postage and the fateful words ' @entity5 ' ... but the 23 - year - old crew mechanic never had the chance to open it as the @entity9 he was working on went down in flames in 1937			2
now , the @entity12 pensioner who owns the scorched piece of history is selling it - along with the rest of his 15 ton collection of wartime airship memorabilia , which includes several items found onboard the ill - fated @entity5			1
@entity20 , 75 , has nearly 600 items for sale this month - pictures , silverware and even newspaper billboards from the @entity26			1
his enormous collection of @entity28 is being sold at @entity30 and @entity30 auctioneers in @entity31 , @entity32 over four separate auctions and the entire lot is expected to reach £ 1million			1

@entity12 pensioner @entity20 is selling his 15 ton collection of wartime airship memorabilia , which includes this unopened , scorched letter found onboard the ill - fated @entity41 a signed - and singed - ticket receipt from the @entity41 , which went down in flames in 1937 an airship cocktail shaker in the shape of a @entity9 is one of 600 items that are up for sale of the 97 people on board , there were 35 fatalities , including one death among the ground crew			1
the disaster shattered public confidence in the mode of transport and marked the end of the airship era			1
it is thought the letter featuring burn marks could fetch more than £ 8,000			1
the auction will also feature passenger lists from the @entity41 the day of the disaster - may 6 , 1937			1
more unusual artefacts include bottles of beer and cocktail shakers in the shape of @entity80 from onboard airships			2
even single stamps found on board some zeppelins are expected to fetch £ 5,000 because of their rarity			1

until the middle of 1916 , @entity12 could find no defence against @entity9 bombers - they flew too high			2
but in mid- 1916 the balance shifted , when a member of the @entity106 firework family invented explosive tracer bullets this is the moment the 804ft - long @entity109 exploded over the @entity45 in @entity45 , @entity46 on may 6 , 1937 during @entity26 , the @entity9 had been responsible for the first blitz over @entity111			1
and in 1937 , the threat of @entity113 was impending			2
the @entity9 was a wholly @entity4 product			2
count @entity115 , born in 1838 , had been inspired to develop his airship by the sight of tethered balloons being used as observation posts during the @entity120			1
after countless setbacks , he developed his first successful airship in 1900 - three years before @entity123 and @entity124 achieved the world 's first powered flight			1
it was a tremendous feat which made the count a national icon			2
the @entity4 @entity130 hailed him as the greatest @entity4 of the 20th century			2
over the next few years he improved on its design			2
the individual hydrogen gas cells inside the airship 's canvas envelope were better proofed against igniting the hydrogen with static electricity			1
aluminium alloy produced the strength of steel at one - third of the weight , and more powerful engines gave the airships an ever - increasing range			0
and so @entity80 became the first aerial passenger transport ... later adapted for war			1
a bronze medallion created by @entity149 to commemorate an expedition to the @entity151 in 1926 in an airship will also be sold and is expected to reach £ 700			1
it reads : ‘ for the greatest discovery trip ever made and apparently for the greatest nonstop flight ever made			0
’ mr @entity20 , from @entity46 , is believed to own the world ’s biggest personal collection of airship memorabilia which he has collected over 40 years			1
property tycoon mr @entity20 has only given one interview about his collection and has declined to give any more information			1
it is believed he originally intended to make a museum to show the public his collection , which started in 1968 , before deciding to sell it at auction			0
mr @entity20 is well known for donating much of his fortune to charity - gifting all residents over the age of 70 in @entity46 £ 100 gift vouchers every year for the last five years			1
he has said previously all the money from the sale will be donated to charity			1
head auctioneer @entity175 said : ‘ mr @entity20 is a very wealthy man so he would ask people all over to keep an eye out for military memorabilia which is how he has this amazing collection			1
‘ we specialise in wartime collections so although the sale was offered to @entity184 's and @entity185 , we were able to negotiate a good deal because of our knowledge and contacts			1
‘ in the last auction , we had people bidding online from @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity4 - all over the world really			0
‘ it has been fascinating cataloguing the collection , i have learned so much about zeppelins			0
‘ we are very lucky to have it , although we have had to hire extra storage space			0
’ @entity200 , the @entity9 was used by the upper - classes for travel with a ticket in 1936 costing $ 3,000 - equivalent to £ 32,000 today			1
the @entity9 was created by a @entity4 , count @entity115 born in 1838			0
he has seen tethered balloons being used as an observation post during the @entity120			0
a bronze medallion created by @entity149 to commemorate an expedition to the @entity151 in 1926 in an airship will also be sold and is expected to reach £ 700 the front cover of the @entity5 passenger list and , right , a handmade poster from a @entity12 soldier to an injured colleague in 1918 silently dropping death from the skies ... zeppelins attack @entity12 in @entity26 by @entity218 by 1912 , the airship was considered one of @entity4 's deadliest weapons			1
the @entity12 government was at a loss as to how to combat them			0
shells attached to grappling hooks were envisaged , and aerial minefields of mines dangling from balloons on a cable , of which @entity231 remarked : ' since damocles there has been no such experiment			0
' it was actually a biplane , dropping a bomb on @entity238 's cabbage patch in @entity239 , on christmas eve 1914 , which represented the first attack on mainland @entity12 for centuries			1
but @entity80 were not far behind			0
once the kaiser had agreed to bombing raids on most of @entity247 except his cousin 's royal palaces , the count 's airships were over here with a vengeance , almost silently dropping death from the skies			2
the commander of the @entity256 believed that @entity12 ' could be overcome by means of airships through increasingly extensive destruction of cities , factory complexes , dockyards ... ' and a large number of his superiors believed him			0
many zeppelins carried incendiary bombs in the hope that they could start a general conflagration			0
this largely failed , because half of them failed to ignite and most of those that did could be easily doused			0
but one raid on the @entity276 gutted several blocks of business premises , killing 22 people and causing half a million pounds worth of property damage			2
a zeppelin in flames over @entity247 during @entity26			0
some of the photos in mr @entity20 's collection show commercial and military ( right ) types of airship that highlight the size of the industry that came to an end before @entity113 until the middle of 1916 , @entity12 could find no defence against @entity9 bombers - they flew too high , and any @entity294 planes which did chase them were shot down by the airships ' banks of machine guns			1
but in mid- 1916 the balance shifted , when a member of the @entity106 firework family invented explosive tracer bullets			0
the @entity4 fought back by inventing zeppelins which could fly at 20,000ft			0
these super-craft encountered many problems , though - if they were n't destroyed by jet - stream winds , their crews were too frozen and de-oxygenated to man the controls			0
by the end of 1916 , any hopes of using @entity80 to turn @entity247 into a sea of flame had dwindled			0
not until the very end of @entity26 did the @entity4 begin building vast new @entity80 , capable of carrying a 4,000kg bomb - load			0
by this time , @entity315 had entered the war - and the plan was to drop their deadly load over @entity319 , thus paralysing the will of the @entity315			0
thankfully , after thinking about the sure - to - be awful consequences for 24 hours , the @entity4 chief of naval operations responded with the one word : @entity324 ! the @entity9 did not lose favour with their creators after @entity26 in 1919 one accomplished the first transatlantic crossing by flying from @entity329 to @entity319 against prevailing winds in 108 hours			0
returning six days later , in 75 hours , it achieved the first double crossing , and paved the way for international airship travel			2
the huge @entity9 , called after its inventor , was built in 1928			0
it carried passengers and cargo in perfect safety for one million miles , and seemed to represent the future of long - distance air travel			0
just as with @entity345 after it , the @entity9 's reputation was destroyed by one tragic accident			2
it had been , like @entity345 , the zenith in luxury travel			0
but it was doomed - the fate of the @entity5 ensured the floating airship would always be synonymous with disaster			1
but even before the @entity5 , question marks were being raised			0
@entity355 was non-flammable , yes , but helium - fuelled airships were also fragile and had a chequered history			0
of four @entity315 - built airships , two ditched in the sea and one was wrecked in violent winds			0
the @entity12 used rigid airships for passenger mail , but our airship programme came to an end after the appalling tragedy of @entity368			1
@entity369 and @entity370 had similar experiences			0
yet somehow the airship is too seductive a vision for people to give up on it			2
it floats like a butterfly as it travels quickly and silently to its destination			0
@entity355 - filled airships such as the @entity379 over @entity247 have yet to prove themselves in bad conditions			0
but the new generation of @entity80 , built in the city of @entity384 , where the only truly successful giant airships have been made , may have put together that broken mould and given back travel 's ultimate luxury .			2

@entity20 , from @entity46 , has nearly 600 items for sale in second of four auctions
property tycoon 's entire lot expected to fetch £ 1million
