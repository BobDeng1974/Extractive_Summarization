mr @entity7 was taking part in the @entity29 and had reached 132mph - smashing the previous best in his of 124mph			2
@entity46 , who witnessed the crash , said : ‘ your initial response is hoping the driver gets out and he did but it is still quite shocking when it happens			0
survival : medics looked over mr @entity7 following his accident in the boat , but ' he was fine , just a bit stiff ' damage : mr @entity7 's @entity10 class boat is pictured here after being recovered from the lake on friday ‘ on the lake you have several boats with divers on board and as soon as a boat goes over it is full throttle over to them			1

he was a bit shaken and a bit cold but other than that he was fine			0
‘ the water conditions were perfect and there were nine records set through the week and @entity7 had at least two of them			2
‘ the high speed runs are always exciting and you have a mixture of relief and elation - it was the last run of the week and certainly the most dramatic			0
