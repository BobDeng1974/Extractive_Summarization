@entity0 , from @entity44 , said : ' a year ago , i was so heavy i could barely walk			1
i ’d be knocking back up to four different types of painkillers before breakfast some days			0
' i ’d always been big , but the weight just piled on after i injured my knees in 2007			0
i had three lots of surgery , and while i was recovering , i just got bigger and bigger			0
' i went back to uni to study for a phd , and i knew i could n’t live the student lifestyle the way i had done before - i had to do something about my weight			1
student life took its toll on @entity0 and she gorged on pizza and junk food for her meals ' but i knew that if i was going to beat the bulge , i ’d have to shun the takeaways - so i moved into the house next door to a gym			1
' it was just what i needed to give myself a kick start			0
i met a fitness coach who helped me develop a lifestyle plan			2
' i go to the gym a couple of times a week , but i also just do things like go for a walk around the park and think more carefully about what i eat			2
' i ’m thrilled with the amount of weight i ’ve lost - i ca n’t believe the difference losing weight has made to my whole life			2

my parents tried to get me to eat healthy meals , but i ’d always sneak off and buy sweets and crisps at school			2
' when i started at university , i did what most students do - spent my time drinking , eating processed food , and not moving around an awful lot			0
' i ’d tried dieting before , but always ended up putting all the weight back on again straight away			0
' but this time , i did n’t want to do that - so when i moved house , i decided it might keep me motivated if i was living next to the gym - no excuses			2
' @entity0 started a fitness programme put together by fitness consultant @entity109 - who devised healthy meal plans and exercise programmes to melt away the pounds			1
@entity0 has moved next to a gym and the results have been startling , after she has lost half of her body weight @entity0 joined the gym , where she works out for 60 - 90 minutes three or four times a week and has seen a huge difference and living next door to the @entity120 , she had no excuse to miss a session			1
@entity0 added : ' the programme has been brilliant for me - it ’s a healthy lifestyle change i can stick to , rather than a faddy diet			1

' but making a few small changes to my life has made the world of difference			0
' i make sure i eat small , healthy meals throughout the day , so i do n’t get hungry , and i fit in my exercise around my life - i ’ve started walking instead of taking the bus , and try and fit in a workout whenever i can			1
@entity0 has changed her lifestyle completely and has now dropped to a size 12 - 14 dress from a size 24 ' if i have a busy week ahead , i cook all my meals from scratch at the weekend and freeze them , so i do n’t resort to ringing for a takeaway			1

' we ’ve tried to devise a plan that does n’t make her feel like she ’s missing out on anything , while doing a healthy amount of exercise a week			0
' i tell her to try and get her heart to 115bpm for at least 60 - 90 minutes three or four times a week - which encourages the body to burn off fat reserves , rather than use energy from elsewhere			0
' @entity0 said : ' i started blogging about my weightloss to keep myself on the straight and narrow - i thought if i made a public record of how well i was doing , it would force me not to give in			1
