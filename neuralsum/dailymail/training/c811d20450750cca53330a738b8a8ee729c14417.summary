the @entity0 is expected to advise @entity1 to vote for parties that are in favour of scrapping @entity5 's nuclear deterrent , file photo the @entity0 is preparing to publish an extraordinary document advising @entity1 on voting in the general election			1
the document – which will provoke yet another row with the government – suggests @entity12 should be scrapped , proposes more @entity15 integration and questions parts of the @entity17 ’s austerity programme			1
it claims to offer advice for the country ’s 30million @entity1 on how to ‘ approach the general election ’ in may			0
billed as a ‘ letter from the @entity0 ’s @entity24 ’ , it is ‘ addressed to all members of the @entity0 ’			2
last night conservative mps said the ‘ manifesto ’ was littered with errors and questioned the wisdom of the @entity0 intervening in the political debate so close to an election			1
the bishops insist it is ‘ not a shopping list of policies we would like to see , it is a call for the new direction that we believe our political life ought to take ’			0
but it goes on to offer commentary on a string of political issues			0
one of the most controversial sections is on @entity5 ’s nuclear deterrent , @entity12 , which the @entity44 say they want to retain but others , including the resurgent @entity46 , want scrapped			1
the document says : ‘ the sheer scale of indiscriminate destructive power represented by nuclear weapons such as @entity12 was only justifiable , if at all , by appeal to the principle of mutually assured destruction			1
shifts in the global strategic realities mean that the traditional arguments for nuclear deterrence need re-examining			2
’ the document will also propose more @entity60 integration			2
‘ after the @entity63 , the nations of @entity60 sought to rebuild for prosperity through a shared determination that never again would global neighbours resort to mass slaughter , ’ it says			0
‘ @entity69 churchmen worked tirelessly to promote understanding and cooperation … that history is not an argument for the structures and institutions of the @entity15 as they now exist			2
but it is an enduring argument for continuing to build structures of trust and cooperation between the nations of @entity60			0
’ the @entity0 is also expected to recommend even closer integration within the @entity15 , file photo conservative mp @entity81 , pictured , criticised the @entity0 's intervention in the election campaign on the economy , the @entity0 says unemployment ‘ has not risen as high as was predicted ’			1
in fact , it has not risen under the @entity17 , falling by 596,000 since 2010 , with 1.75million more people entering work			0
the document also says @entity5 has ‘ seen the burgeoning of in - work poverty ’ – another questionable claim , since the latest figures show that the proportion of people in in - work poverty is the same as in 2010			2
the document claims that ‘ the greatest burdens of austerity have not been born [ sic ] by those with the broadest shoulders ’			0
but the @entity104 has published figures suggesting that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction			0
the document does praise some government policies including its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product on foreign aid as a way to mitigate ‘ grotesque inequalities of wealth and power ’ between rich and poor countries			0
conservative mp @entity81 said : ‘ it is deeply disturbing that the @entity0 appears to be entering the political arena based on a series of clear misrepresentations of facts			1
‘ the call to abandon our nuclear defence in increasingly uncertain times and for more @entity15 integration with no consultation of the @entity5 public will rightly cause concern			1

the @entity0 is preparing a document to advise its flock how to vote
it is understood the document *opposes* the @entity12 nuclear deterrent
the controversial document is also in favour of closer @entity15 integration
conservative mp @entity81 has criticised the @entity0 's intervention
