by @entity0 some 650,000 people said they wanted @entity2 to be freed from her cell where she is eight months pregnant and in shackles with her toddler son @entity5 next to her			1
the 27 - year - old ’s ‘ crime ’ was to marry a @entity6 because her father was a @entity8 and a judge said she should be worshipping @entity10			1
@entity2 , 27 , was convicted by a @entity14 court this week of apostasy , or the renunciation of faith , and sentenced to death			1
@entity20 is @entity6 , her husband said			1
but the court considers her to be @entity8 @entity20 ( in wheelchair ) with his son , @entity5 after being recently reunited			2
@entity5 is being held in a brutal @entity25 jail alongside his heavily pregnant mother , @entity26 , who awaits her death sentence for marrying a @entity6 yet in a statement the @entity25 embassy to the @entity29 sided with the court and claimed that she was lying about her family raising her as a @entity6			1
in a stinging rebuke , it claimed that it was ‘ unwise and dangerous ’ to protest about @entity26 ’s treatment even though it is a breach of @entity25 ’s constitution			2
@entity26 has been locked up in a notorious women ’s prison in @entity14 since september after being charged with adultery and apostasy and given the death sentence			0
she was also sentenced to 100 lashes as the @entity25 court refused to recognize her 2011 marriage to husband @entity0 , a naturalized @entity29 citizen from @entity46 , @entity47			1
the judge in the case said that because she was born a muslim she should stay a @entity8			1
the case has attracted international outrage and the governments of the @entity54 , the @entity29 and the @entity55 have all spoken of their concern			1
but now , as @entity26 ’s lawyers file an appeal to get her off death row , @entity58 has revealed that its petition to have @entity26 released has reached 650,000 signatures			2
a petition sponsored by @entity65 has garnered more than 650,000 signatures demanding the release of @entity2 ( right ) , pictured here with her husband @entity0			1
@entity70 , @entity65 's @entity25 researcher , said : ‘ the plight and the bravery of this young pregnant mother has clearly touched the world			1
‘ more than 650,000 @entity65 supporters have taken action to call for her immediate and unconditional release			0
‘ since @entity26 has been sentenced , we are deeply concerned at the conditions of her detention and use of cruel and inhuman forms of restraint			0
‘ we have received worrying reports that she has been constantly shackled			0
the @entity25 authorities must guarantee @entity26 's safety and release her immediately and unconditionally			2
’ such calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears with the @entity25 embassy to the @entity29 , however			1
its statement it claimed that @entity26 ’s case was merely a ‘ legal issue and not a religious or a political one			0
' it expressed ‘ regret ’ at reports of her fate and hit out at those who have ‘ mistakenly accused the government of @entity25 of violating human rights ’			2
the statement said : ‘ the official records of the @entity103 indicates that the real name of the lady mentioned in this case as @entity107 is actually ' @entity108 ' and there is no official record shows that her name was changed to @entity112			0
‘ @entity108 was born in um @entity113 in @entity115 state on jan. @entity116			0
1986 to @entity8 @entity25 parents and the claim that the mother is an @entity6 from @entity120 is untrue			0
’ the statement added that ‘ freedom of choice is the cornerstone of both @entity10 and @entity123 ’ , even though @entity26 has effectively been told by a court which religion she must worship			0
pressure to help @entity26 has also come from two senators who have sent the secretary of state a second letter demanding that more be done to help @entity26			0
@entity47 's senator @entity130 and fellow @entity131 senator @entity131 of @entity132 have said they are concerned that the government is wasting time			0
earlier this week @entity135 revealed that it was allegedly jealousy and greed which drove @entity2 ’s own family to file lawsuit against her alleging apostasy and adultery which led to the criminal charges being filed			1
her half brother and half sister - who had not seen her for decades - tracked her down so they could get rid of her and take over her successful general store , @entity26 ’s lawyers alleged			0
@entity0 has only been allowed into the prison once to see his son @entity5 , 20 months , in what was an emotional reunion .			2

petition sponsored by @entity65 asks the @entity25 government to stop the *execution* of @entity2 , 27 , who is eight - months pregnant
she married her husband @entity0 , a naturalized @entity29 citizen , in 2011
a judge in her case said that since she was born a muslim she should stay one
jealousy and greed allegedly *prompted* @entity20 's own family to file the lawsuit against her
