pricing scandal : cod - liver oil capsules are being bought for up to £ 89.50 - with identical versions available to consumers on the high street for just £ 3.50 this means chemists are able to select products they deem suitable from drug companies and bill the taxpayer , part of the wider prescription scandal which has emerged in recent years			1
a whistleblower told @entity28 : ' when they got a prescription for something like cod - liver oil , pharmacists used to walk round the counter , pick a pack off the shelf and then charge the @entity1 that cost			1
now , all of a sudden , they are dispensing packets of cod - liver oil for £ 89			2
they do n’t even keep these products in the open sale area of the pharmacy			0

the revelation is likely to add more pressure to the system - the @entity1 is under pressure to make savings of £ 20 billion over the next three years and many trusts have resorted to cutting staff and rationing treatments			1
although the money it receives from the government has not been cut - unlike other departments - it has ordered to spend the money more efficiently			0
ministers say the savings have to be made now to ensure there are enough funds to pay for the care of the aging population			2
in november it was revealed that hospitals are squandering £ 500million a year paying too much for blankets , syringes and other basic equipment			2
an investigation found that some are being charged twice as much as others for the same items			0

' the consequences of inaction in the back office will only be felt more acutely in frontline care			0
' @entity143 , managing director of the price comparison website @entity145 , who was also involved in the report , warned that suppliers were ' taking advantage ' of the @entity1			1
' it 's not necessarily about the competence of the @entity1 , it 's about the pricing behaviour of the suppliers			1
' they are taking advantage of a lack of information			0
what seems to be happening is rather than a fair price being charged , as much as you can get it being charged			0
' the report did not name individual hospitals or the suppliers			0
