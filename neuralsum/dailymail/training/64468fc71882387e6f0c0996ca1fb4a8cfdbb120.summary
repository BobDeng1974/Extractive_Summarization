by @entity0 @entity2 governor @entity1 admitted today that he 's avoiding questions about certain national issues because he 's worried about giving ' ill - informed ' answers that will bite him in the rear if he runs for president in 2016			1
@entity1 told @entity10 's @entity9 that he wo n't ' pretend ' to have an opinion on issues he has n't studied such as the @entity14 just because it 's a hot topic and people want to know what he thinks			1
but ' if and when there 's a time that comes that i need to be telling people in this country what my view is on those issues , i will , ' he promised			2
' if i run for president , you can be sure that i 'll have an opinion , ' @entity1 said in comments first reported by @entity31			1
@entity2 governor @entity1 said today he 's purposefully withholding his opinion on salient national issues because he 's ' ill - informed ' ' but until that time i think it 's quite frankly immature to be expressing a lot of those opinions just because i 'm sitting up here in front of this room and you asked , ' @entity1 said , taking a shot across the bow at his contemporaries			1
' you can ask whatever you like , i do n't have to answer , ' he said , taking on a defensive tone			0
@entity9 expressed disbelief that @entity1 's been ' ducking ' questions about federal issues because he 's ignorant , but @entity1 told him with a straight face that was truly the case			2
' believe me , you ca n't imagine how ill - informed i am , ' @entity1 said , prompting laughter from the audience			0
' if i do n't think my answer is going to be smart and will stand the test of time , you can be damned sure that i 'm not going to answer , he said , ' because you 'll have this tape and you 'll use it			0
' @entity1 made the last remark with a grin , indicating that he was half - joking			0
while the line was made partly in jest , the @entity60 governor hit on a serious point : comments he makes now on federal issues open him up to future attacks by his opponents should he seek higher office			1
changing his position on major political issues before or after he announces his intentions to run for president could be politically damaging , too			2
@entity1 told @entity10 's @entity9 in an - onstage interview at the @entity74 in @entity75 that he 'll share his opinion on the issues if he decides to run for president , but he has n't made a decision yet during the interview @entity1 would n't commit to running for president , but the two - term governor confirmed that he 's still considering it , despite political woes stemming from a government employee 's decision to purposefully cause a traffic jam on a busy bridge last year			1
' i 've been pretty clear , you know , i certainly am going to consider it , but whether i do it or not is something that i honestly do n't know yet , ' he claimed after @entity9 asked him about his intentions at the beginning of the interview			0
the father of four noted that his children , ages 11 through 20 , are ' relatively ' young , and that 's something that continues to weigh on his mind			0
@entity1 said he honestly was n't in a hurry to make any decisions about his political future and cautioned the audience against politicians who are , ribbing his potential opponents once again			1
' the fact is that you should beware of people in my opinion are overanxious to make that decision before they need to			0
' that would seem to indicate to me ambition over wisdom , ' he said , ' and i do n't think that 's what you want in the person sitting in the @entity119			0

@entity2 governor @entity1 is considered a likely 2016 @entity60 presidential *candidate*
today @entity1 said he honestly has n't made up his mind about his intentions and is in no hurry to do so
he admitted , however , that he is considering a run and that 's why he is n't *doling* out his opinion on serious national issues he knows little about
' if i run for president , you can be sure that i 'll have an opinion , ' @entity1 promised
