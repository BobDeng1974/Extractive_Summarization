by @entity0 published : 15:15 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 13 september 2013 former presidental adviser @entity1 was the victim of a putsch within @entity4 's re-election campaign inner circle , according to a new book the man most responsible for getting @entity4 to the @entity8 – the man who had ' crafted his ads since 2004 ' and ' had cowritten his narrative ' – was forced out of the president 's inner circle during the 2012 re-election campaign , a new book reveals			1
@entity4 's two main campaign generals marginalized @entity1 , the campaign strategist behind @entity4 's 1990s rise to power from local organizer to president			1
@entity8 communications director @entity19 and re-election campaign manager @entity20 were in open conflict with ' axe ' throughout much of the re-election push			1
@entity1 , insiders said , referred to them as ' two strongmen running the @entity27			1
' he believed @entity19 , busy in the @entity8 , was n't plugged into the campaign enough			1
and he thought @entity20 , whom @entity4 had trusted to ' run a business ' in getting him re-elected , was insecure and lacked strong leadership skills			2
@entity33 online editor @entity32 interviewed political insiders about the campaigns for his book , ' the message			0
' the @entity38 published an excerpt on thursday			0
he details how @entity1 tried to muscle @entity20 out of his job entirely , but ended up as the odd man out himself			1
@entity43 director @entity20 ( @entity44 ) got tired of @entity1 agitating to get him fired , writes @entity32			1
ultimately it was @entity1 who was ousted			0
@entity20 has stayed on , and now runs the campaign 's successor organization , organizing for action @entity19 , who ran @entity4 's first presidential campaign , inherited @entity52 's @entity8 job hear the @entity53			1
there was no love lost between the two @entity32 , formerly of @entity56 but now in charge of @entity33 , got access to many of the major players behind @entity4 's political successes ' @entity1 repeatedly tried to convince other senior aides to bypass @entity20 , ' @entity32 writes , ' and they believed he was trying to oust @entity20 altogether			1
@entity1 had never wanted him to get the job in the first place			2
now he was complaining to others inside @entity4 ’s inner circle about @entity20 ’s shortcomings , but there was no support for a change of campaign manager			1
' ' @entity1 knew that @entity19 had confidence in @entity20 , and nobody could come up with a good candidate to replace him			1
" for a good six months of that campaign , they were trying to wedge him out , which created all of the divisions , " said one senior @entity4 campaign official			2
" but there was no one else , and @entity20 had positioned himself with @entity19			2
@entity83 had tried a long time to prevent him from getting that job			0
" the affable @entity1 ultimately left the operation after he left his job managing messaging from a perch near the @entity53 , along with @entity8 press secretary @entity90			1
' there never was another serious candidate for the position ' of campaign manager , other than @entity20 , @entity32 relates			1
' @entity19 had handed him operational control of the 2008 campaign			2
and the following year , in the @entity8 , @entity19 had once again told @entity20 to run @entity97			1
' ' implicit in that offer was the notion that the two operatives could maintain their working alliance : @entity19 would set the course and steer the strategy , while @entity20 would run the machine			2
@entity19 could stay inside the @entity8 , close to @entity105 , while still controlling a headquarters 700 miles away			2
hands - off : @entity4 stayed away from the palace intrigue and stayed focused on retail campaigning , leaving his inner circle to fight among themselves @entity19 ( @entity44 ) remains an integral part of the @entity4 @entity8 , determining the course of the administration 's external communications -- a job @entity1 held until 2011 the campaign itself never really stopped , as political observers noted during @entity4 's first term			1
@entity43 , his campaign committee , continued to operate hundreds of field offices in key swing states while the president was busy governing			0
and the ad buys continued long before @entity4 was renominated as the @entity128 ' 2012 candidate			0
' the message : the reselling of president @entity4 ' by @entity32 is due in stores on sept. 19 all that continuous campaign muscle needed leadership			0
and all the jockeying for position brought tension on a grand scale			0
when ' axe ' left the @entity8 late in the re-election season , he soon after left the campaign operation			2
that , @entity32 writes , was just the way @entity20 and @entity19 wanted it			2
@entity19 , for one thing , had already inherited @entity1 's @entity8 job , and his office near @entity4 's			1
@entity1 brought some of the resentments upon himself by hiring an attorney to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking what he called ' a very , very small percentage ' of the cost of every tv ad the campaign ran -- in addition to his monthly fees			1
' @entity20 told friends that he was acting under the president ’s direction , ' @entity32 writes , ' which he characterized like this : " i want everybody treated fairly , but i do n’t want anybody to get rich on this			0
they ’re gon na get rich on the books they write afterwards			0
" ' ' many of those who worked with @entity20 doubted his accounts of conversations with @entity4 or @entity19			1
but he acted as if he was empowered by them , and he was			0
@entity20 and @entity1 negotiated hard , as @entity20 hacked away at @entity1 's demands			2
' meanwhile , @entity4 himself stayed above the fray			0
@entity1 , now without his trademark moustache , has retained a silent consultant 's role with @entity4 , but no longer wields serious power inside his political organization it 's a ' business ' : @entity4 offered @entity20 the top campaign job , telling him he could run what amounted to a giant business venture from the headquarters in @entity97 no love lost : @entity1 and @entity19 reportedly worked together but tussled in a power struggle that left @entity1 without a formal campaign role ' @entity4 kept a close team of younger male staffers to manage his immediate needs , ' @entity193 writes , ' and that was all he needed			1
" he needs the guys to play cards and golf , and tell him where he ’s going next and why , " said a former aide			0
' ' " but beyond that , it ’s what function you have			0
and if you ca n’t fulfill that function anymore , or someone can do it better , you ’re gone			0
that ’s hard for those of us who really believe in him			0
but you need to have your eyes open			0
" ' a hands - off manager , the president did n't like mixing it up between disagreeing staffers , according to the book			0
' [ a ] dvisers suspected he knew about the conflicts but pretended they did n’t exist because he had no desire to resolve them , and because he hoped they might peter out			0
@entity4 wanted consensus on communications and strategy , not personal conflict			0
' that left the big guns to fight it out among themselves			0
behind @entity19 's and @entity20 's ' intensely competitive exteriors , they nurtured intensely competitive interiors ' as well , the book recounts			2
but unlike @entity1 and @entity90 , they ' were still on the inside ring of @entity4 ’s circle of confidants ' and survived .			1

@entity1 wanted campaign manager @entity20 fired , but he wound up the odd man out himself
palace intrigue led ' axe ' to refer to @entity20 and @entity8 messaging chief @entity19 as ' two strongmen running the @entity27 '
the two men resented @entity1 for getting rich by taking a percentage of the hundreds of millions spent on campaign ads
an aloof @entity4 stayed out of the way as his inner circle fought a political *gladiator* game that pushed out @entity1 and press secretary @entity90
