forget the disappearing act in the semi-final			2
never mind the stats - men telling us that the only time he touched the ball in @entity8 ’s penalty area was when he got lucky with his middle - of - the - goal spot - kick in the sudden - death shoot - out			1
let ’s hear it for that team talk			0
follow the leader : @entity15 ( centre ) speaks to his @entity18 team - mates before extra time in their premature desperation to proclaim @entity15 as the greatest footballer of all time , the @entity21 ’s sycophants are citing not the way he played for 120 minutes but what he had to say to his amigos between full - time and extra-time			1
look at the pictures , they protest			0
see how he takes over from manager @entity32 come the crunch			0
for heaven ’s sake , spare us			0
because they do their own idol a disservice			0
not least by ignoring that it was @entity41 - the man who really did most to squeeze @entity18 through to sunday ’s @entity42 against @entity43 - who picked up the motivation mantle after the @entity46 had threatened through the first 15 minutes of the additional half - hour			1
@entity15 was literally @entity47 on this occasion			1
a peripheral figure in a match which , while important in its result , was monumental only by the scale of its tedium			0
that does not mean @entity15 is anything less than an exceptional footballer , perhaps the finest of his generation			1
but if he is to be elevated to the pantheon of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 it will take something other than a spot of tub - thumping in the huddle			2
stepping up to the plate : @entity41 led the team talk at half - time during extra time at his shimmering best , @entity15 is a delight to behold			1
as a shooting star in the highest firmament of the club game he may well be entitled to begrudge @entity78 being given his turn as world footballer of the year just because he himself had won that honour so often			2
as it stands at this moment @entity15 needs a final - winning spectacular against @entity43 in the @entity83			1
not least because he has disappointed in his previous @entity84			0
that will sound severe to @entity15 ’s legion of admirers but it is only the most exacting judgement which makes any ultimate accolade worth receiving			1
this is a challenge to which @entity15 is capable of rising and it will be sad for him , as well as unfortunate for us all , if suspicions that he may be less than totally fit for the grandest occasion of his life prove well - founded			1
that way ? @entity15 gestures during the @entity42 semi-final between @entity18 and @entity8 video when @entity15 is on form - highlights there did appear to be a heaviness in the legs and perhaps a favouring of one of them against the @entity46			1
also , a hint of fleshiness about the jowels hinted at possible limitations on his training			0
certainly , the crisp finishing which had carried @entity18 through the earlier stages of the tournament was missing			0
although it has to be said that those four goals tended to mask performances which fell rather short of virtuoso splendour			0
it may well be that the brutal tackling which has provided a nasty undercurrent to @entity121 2014 is taking its toll of @entity15			1
chilling out : @entity15 sits down during a training session near @entity124 on thursday ahead of the final if so , while the effects may not be as drastic as the crippling of @entity129 , they could be debilitating nonetheless			1
if that is the case , the heart goes out to him			0
if not , does he deserve as yet to be lacing up the boots in celestial company ? not unless he pulls his socks up on sunday			2
jubilation : @entity18 players celebrate after defeating @entity8 in a penalty shoot - out on wednesday @entity138 : @entity18 highlights so it ’s goodnight from him , the @entity140 the twitter trolls love to hate			1
and it ’s goodnight from him , the @entity140 whose judgement the more considered @entity144 viewers seriously respect			1
the tv football pundit who divides public opinion more sharply than any other is leaving the building for the last time on sunday night			1
and it 's goodnight from me : @entity140 will retire as the @entity144 's leading television football pundit this sunday @entity140 made his final appearance before the @entity155 cameras in may			1
quite why , when he is not yet 60 , is a matter between himself and his @entity144			1
he will disappear from our screens for good – well , with the probable exceptions of occasional guest appearances – when the lights go out in that temporary glass studio on @entity163			0
not a bad way to go out , a @entity42 in @entity121			1
the @entity144 are making a fuss about it which has included a documentary programme			2
but switching off his broadcasting career of 20 - odd years does not mark the most significant retirement of @entity140 ’s life			1
most of the younger tele - generation may not realise it but this man ’s most profound analysis of the game was expressed on the pitch , when he was one of the most cerebral players of his era			1
back in the day : @entity140 ( left ) pictured with @entity182 ( centre ) and sir @entity184 in the 1990s having cut his @entity186 teeth on helping @entity187 win the @entity189 title , and with it promotion to the @entity192 , @entity140 ’s made his lifetime career move to @entity194			2
the apparently overt elegance and laid - back style which would come to irritate the detractors among his television audience were a source of enormous reassurance to his @entity202 team - mates			2
they called him ' jockey ' but they would have been better sticking to his original nick - name ' stretch '			2
that referred to the languorous manner in which he would extend one of those long legs to coax the ball away from opposing forwards and thereby snuff out danger with what looked like effortless ease			0
consider the importance of that classy contribution to a golden age of @entity219 domination both at home and in @entity221			0
@entity222 glory : @entity140 ( right ) , @entity224 ( left ) and @entity225 hold up the @entity226 in 1981 @entity140 won three @entity226 winner ’s medals			2
he helped @entity219 to eight @entity230 league titles and two @entity231 , which included the classic domestic double of 1986 to which he captained them under the management of @entity225			0
to all that , he can add our @entity237 , one @entity239 and six @entity240			0
to some extent his abilities went less recognised in his own country			0
he played only 26 times for @entity245 and was dropped from the ill - fated squad for @entity247 86			0
in part that related to the formidable centre - back pairing of @entity250 and @entity251 which sir @entity252 had forged at @entity253			0
international duty : @entity140 pictured playing for @entity245 at the 1982 @entity255 in @entity256 it may have had something to do , also , with his seemingly aloof demeanour			2
that was at its most evident after he won the ball and proceeded to build attacks from the back with his calm , unhurried , perceptive passes			0
if @entity245 ever did produce a @entity268 , it was @entity140			2
and a very good night to him .			0

@entity41 was the man who picked up the motivation mantle against @entity8 in the @entity42 semi-final on wednesday
@entity15 needs a final - winning spectacular against @entity43 in the @entity83
the @entity277 superstar is perhaps the finest footballer of his generation
@entity140 will retire as the @entity144 's lead television pundit on sunday
