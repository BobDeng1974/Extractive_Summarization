@entity0 have got themselves into yet another potentially explosive muddle over the report into @entity4 bid corruption that has already descended into farce			2
after the debacle of investigator @entity8 disowning the summary of his own report by ethics judge @entity11 , the buck was passed to @entity0 compliance chief @entity12 to decide the next step after reviewing all the documents			1
and fifa hope @entity12 will put enough evidence from the full @entity8 report to the executive committee meeting in @entity18 next month for them to decide once and for all whether a re-vote is needed over the staging of the 2018 and 2022 @entity21			1
@entity8 is probing the conduct of five @entity0 officials - including three who are still on the executive but to complicate matters , @entity8 is still probing the individual conduct of five people — three believed still to be on the executive , one a high - profile former member and another a powerful @entity30 official			1
and @entity33 insiders believe it will be impossible for @entity12 to divulge fresh information from the @entity8 file to the executive in @entity38 on december 18 - 19 — even with names redacted — without compromising @entity8 ’s inquiries , especially if they involve three people who will be in the room			1
@entity43 looks to have been cancelled by @entity44 as far as their supporters are concerned			1
the traditional festive drinks with @entity44 fan groups may well be ditched this year , with the club seemingly sensitive to any criticism of under - pressure manager @entity51			1
last year the @entity53 waited until the day after their @entity43 bash with fans before announcing ticket price rises			1
an @entity44 spokesman said they were organising a larger gathering of supporters for an end - of - season party			2
former @entity63 rugby captain @entity62 , who is married to the @entity65 ’s granddaughter @entity64 but has time on his hands after leaving his role coaching @entity68 , is understood to have signed up for a reality show			1
@entity62 , pictured with @entity64 , could be appearing on our television screens in the near future the @entity74 sports book of the year award has a habit of going to a rank outsider — indeed , the more obscure the better			2
@entity78 ’s autobiography and a @entity80 biography would probably be the favourites at thursday ’s ceremony but a book about running up and down @entity84 may beat them to the prize			2
@entity86 says ' oui ' to @entity87 it has been assumed since @entity86 said athletics was ‘ in his dna ’ when turning down the chance to lead the @entity91 that he preferred to run for the @entity87 presidency			2
and it is understood @entity86 will announce in @entity97 sports newspaper @entity96 that he is officially in the running to succeed @entity99 next august			0
the choice of a @entity97 media outlet suggests @entity86 is positioning himself as an international statesman rather than a @entity104 one and @entity97 is an important language in the athletics community			0
lord @entity86 turned down the chance to lead the @entity91 as he has aspirations to succeed @entity99 @entity109 , who has led the @entity110 ’ all - party campaign to regulate the secondary ticket market , is hopeful that the government will take notice of the peers winning a rare amendment			0
this would see greater transparency in online ticket selling in time for next autumn ’s @entity120			0
culture secretary @entity121 is opposed to the changes but the government response will be led by the @entity124 , whose secretary of state @entity125 is the mp for @entity127 , of all places			0
the haphazard preparations for the @entity130 in @entity131 include having to lengthen the iconic rowing course at @entity133 by 30 metres at the start and the finish to allow the requisite amount of slow - down water between the finish line and the end of the lake			0
the @entity141 have finally decided to employ headhunters in their search for a new general secretary to replace @entity145 , with @entity146 helping the recruitment hunt			0
@entity141 chairman @entity148 had been keen to avoid the cost but was persuaded otherwise by the @entity141 board for reasons of transparency			0
the @entity141 have employed headhunters to find a suitable replacement for @entity145			0

compliance chief @entity12 will decide next step regarding review
@entity8 is still probing the individual conduct of five people
@entity43 drinks for @entity44 fans may be cancelled this year
@entity62 has reportedly signed up to take part in a reality show
