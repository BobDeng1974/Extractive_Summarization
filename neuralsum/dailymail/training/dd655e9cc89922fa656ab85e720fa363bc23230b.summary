by @entity0 published : 17:57 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 9 august 2013 34 - year - old @entity1 was horrified to be advised by a doctor that she would not get the treatment she needed on the @entity4 because it is a ' shambles ' when @entity1 was diagnosed with cervical cancer while working as a banker in @entity8 , she flew home to @entity10 to receive the best care the @entity4 could provide			1
but , on arriving home , the 34 - year - old was horrified to be told by her doctor that the health service was in a ‘ shambles ’ , she would ‘ probably die on the waiting list ’ – and would be better off going back to @entity8 to get treatment there			1
she eventually did just that but now , five years after successful treatment overseas , remains ‘ disgusted ’ by what she was told			1
she said : ‘ he clearly had zero sympathy for the situation i was in			0
he may have been telling the truth but he was so callous about it , he took away any hope i had			0
‘ instead of offering treatment and talking about my options he said , “ the @entity4 is a shambles			1
you ’ll probably die on the waiting list			0
” i was in absolute shock			0
’ ‘ it is not the kind of thing someone with such a low chance of survival expects to hear			0
’ miss @entity1 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2008 , shortly after arriving in @entity8 , and initially began treatment there			1
but when doctors began to operate they discovered the cancer had spread , and removed 14 lymph nodes from her groin and legs , as well as her ovaries			1
the fact the cancer had spread meant miss @entity56 ’s survival rate had dropped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent			1
she was told the treatment she would require next would be extremely expensive and was advised to come back home			1
she said : ‘ i knew straight away i could n’t afford it			2
i paid a lot of @entity62 tax so expected a high level of care on the @entity4			0
’ but upon visiting her local doctor in the @entity67 and @entity68 area , she was left devastated by his response			2
she said : ‘ i was in a horrific state			0
i walked in fully confident he would get me treatment straight away			2
he looked at me but did not examine me			0
’ miss @entity1 , who worked for @entity74 , took out loans of nearly £ 30,000 and sought treatment in @entity8			1
she received a clear smear test result six weeks later			0
miss @entity1 had started her treatment in @entity8 , but was advised to fly home to have the necessary surgeries there have since been further complications , but she is approaching the five - year cancer - free mark			1
she said : ‘ it ’s disgusting that i should have to fly across the world for treatment when i ’ve worked in @entity88 for most of my life			2
‘ the @entity4 needs to do something because they ’re playing with lives			0
’ a spokesman for @entity67 and @entity68 said : ‘ in 2008 @entity93 maintained a strong performance on cancer waiting times and over 92 per cent of patients were seen within the waiting times guarantee			2
‘ @entity4 care in @entity67 and @entity68 is available to all those who need it			0
we are surprised to learn of the conversation between an independent gp and a patient			0
’ miss @entity1 took out loans of nearly £ 30,000 to pay for her surgeries in @entity8 after she was encouraged to seek treatment there and avoid @entity10 's waiting lists			1

34 - year - old @entity1 was told she would get better treatment where she was living in @entity8
started treatment for cervical cancer in @entity8 but could *n't* afford surgeries
*returned* to the @entity10 but was advised to go back by doctor who said the health service is in a ' shambles '
