a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘ @entity5 ’ people of @entity4 , researchers claim			1
a layer of platinum from an ice core taken in @entity9 has been dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition , known as the ' @entity12 '			1
the freeze has been previously been linked to the demise of the @entity5 people , the prehistoric hunter gatherers who were the first to occupy @entity4			1
according to researchers at @entity17 , this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase , making dozens of species extinct			2
a layer of platinum from an ice core taken from @entity9 has been dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition			1
according to researchers , this provides evidence that a comet led to the demise of the @entity5 people , the prehistoric hunter gatherers who were the first to occupy the @entity4 researcher @entity33 and @entity17 colleagues , writing in the journal @entity35 , found a 100-fold increase in platinum concentration in ice that is around 12,890 years old			1
this is the same period for which oxygen isotope measurements show rapid cooling of the climate - a period known as the ‘ @entity44 ’			0
the @entity44 , or the ‘ @entity12 ’ , saw a rapid return to glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the @entity48 between 12,900 – 11,500 years			0
the @entity12 is associated with the extinction of large mammals , such as the mammoth , and the demise of the @entity4 @entity5 people some scientists believe that the @entity5 people chose to discard spears ( pictured ) and were not wiped out by a comet researchers claim that debris thrown into the atmosphere in an impact may have tipped the @entity60 into global cooling , wiping out native cultures such as the @entity5 people			1
as evidence for the rapid @entity5 depopulation , comet theorists had previously pointed out that very few @entity5 archaeological sites show evidence of human occupation after they died out			2
at the few sites that do , @entity5 and @entity70 artifacts are separated by archaeologically sterile layers of sediments , indicating a time gap between the civilisations			0
they believe that the sediment is a ‘ dead zone ’ in the human archaeological record in @entity4 , beginning with the comet impact and lasting about 500 years			2
but others argue that a lack of later human occupation at @entity5 sites is no reason to assume a population collapse			0
@entity89 archaeologists @entity87 pointed out that short - term occupation @entity91 sites — @entity5 or @entity70 — are the norm			0
‘ that 's because many @entity91 sites are hunting kill sites , and it would be highly unlikely for kills to be made repeatedly in the exact same spot , ' he said			0
‘ so there is nothing surprising about a @entity5 occupation with no other @entity91 zone above it , and it is no reason to infer a disaster			0

platinum found in an ice core has been dated back to the ' @entity12 '
the freeze is linked to the demise of the @entity4 @entity5 people
the evidence *suggests* that a cosmic impact caused planet 's colder phase
