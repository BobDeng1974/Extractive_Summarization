by @entity0 a prankster has caused a stir with supermarket shoppers after swapping wine label descriptions with his own hilarious versions			1
the joker printed off five self - made comedy labels for different wines and stuck them on the shelves at a @entity12 store in @entity13 , south @entity14 – but reckons store bosses still have n’t noticed his prank			1
one of the labels , for a £ 4.09 bottle of @entity20 , describes the wine as : ‘ @entity23 clam flavours with a suspicion of red @entity25 with roadkill or clam chowder			1
’ one of the labels , for a £ 4.09 bottle of @entity20 , describes the wine as : ' @entity23 clam flavours with a suspicion of red @entity33			2
great with roadkill or clam chowder			2
taste guide : @entity29 ' the anonymous joker described a £ 5.79 bottle of @entity38 as tasting like ' bitter clown tears with a hint of suspicion ' another label , for a bottle of @entity43 , reads : ‘ made by actual blue nuns in sea caves protected by wild otters			2
@entity47 bodied with a hint of wet sand			0
’ the labels were cleverly printed to look exactly the same as @entity12 ones , and even include a barcode and information about @entity56 points			1
the prankster claims to have come up with the scheme while he was shopping with his partner			2
he said : ‘ i was navigating the aisles of my local supermarket when , due to my girlfriend 's inability to make a quick decision , my eye was drawn to the flowery descriptions of some of their lower end wines			0
‘ phrases like “ warming spice flavours ” , “ smooth finish ” and “ floral notes ” seemed to litter the florid accounts of the wines ' supposed qualities			0
another label , for a bottle of @entity43 , says : ' made by actual blue nuns in sea caves protected by wild otters			2
@entity47 bodied with a hint of wet sand			0
taste guide : @entity51 ' the joker , who also changed a sign in a @entity86 's store to read ' a pretentious yet sensitive wine with a hint of snozzberry ' , reckons staff still have n't noticed the change ‘ now , it just so happens that wine is firmly on my banned substance list so i certainly was n't in the position to put these contrived claims to the test			1
‘ instead i decided to get down with a bit of culture jamming and recreate the descriptions using my overactive imagination as a guide			0
‘ i think what we 're left with is probably a more honest appraisal of the wine 's true character			0
