posing for the camera before her school prom , @entity1 - @entity0 is the picture of a pretty , fresh - faced @entity5 rose			1
but just one month later , the 16 - year - old 's body had been ravaged by a deadly condition - and doctors have now warned she has just months to live			1
in the space of a few weeks , the glamorous teenager became unable to walk , feed or wash herself			1
she has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting disease that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles			1
and since the prom night , @entity1 's devastated parents have watched helplessly as the disease has taken over her body			1
@entity1 - @entity0 posing for the camera before going to her school prom			1
but just one month later , the 16 - year - old was battling a deadly condition that had ravaged her body - and now has just months to live her parents watched in horror as within the space of a few weeks , the glamorous teenager became unable to walk , feed or wash herself her mother , @entity29 , 43 , said : ' after her prom night , @entity1 's health rapidly declined - and she 's now unable to walk , feed or wash herself			1
' mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives and it 's so rare that there 's not much information about it			1
' doctors have warned us that @entity1 has months to live rather than years and we 're just trying to make the most out of our time left as a family			1
' it was heart - breaking to hear that our little girl had such an awful , terminal disease			2
' for her parents , the picture of @entity1 at the prom is a ' precious ' , yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost			2
mrs @entity0 said : ' @entity1 's prom night is something we will treasure forever , it reminds us of the happy times we 've shared			1
' but despite her diagnosis she has never stopped smiling and still manages to try and sing when she 's feeling well enough			0
' ' she is my only daughter as i have two older sons which makes this even harder for us to take			0
' ' her condition means we are living on a timebomb we do n't know how long we have left as a family			0
@entity1 , with her mother @entity29 , has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting condition that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles for her parents @entity29 and @entity74 , the picture of @entity1 at the prom is a ' precious ' , yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost			1
her mother said : ' @entity79 has devastated our lives ' what are mitochondria ? in every cell in the body , mitochondria are responsible for producing energy ( called @entity87 ) that the cell needs to function			1
cells make up tissues and organs in our bodies , for example the heart and liver			0
they are like power stations in our bodies , supplying the energy every cell needs to function			0
if our cells do not have energy , then the tissues or body organs that the cells are made up of do not work properly			2
one analogy is that if power stations do not produce enough energy for the country , there will be areas of blackout , where parts of the country can not function			0
what is mitochondrial disease ? when a person has mitochondrial disease the @entity116 in the cells are not producing enough energy for the cell			1
sometimes they do not work at all , and sometimes they are just not very efficient			0
if a cell does not get enough energy ( @entity87 ) it can not function properly			0
there is a huge variety in the symptoms and severity of mitochondrial disease			1
it depends on how many cells are affected , and where they are in the body - so every person with mitochondrial disease is affected differently			1
each individual affected will have a different combination of mitochondria that are working and not working within each cell			0
however , there are times when particular body systems are affected in a recognisable pattern and these have particular names , for example @entity145 , @entity147 ’s disease , @entity148 and @entity149			0
the commonest parts of the body affected are those that have the highest energy demands ; brain , muscle , liver , heart and kidney			0
if a lot of mitochondria in the body are affected in the important body organs , like the brain , mitochondrial disease can be very serious			1
the symptoms of mitochondrial disease are usually progressive in body systems where the cells have a high demand for energy , such as brain cells			1
source : the @entity172 ' @entity1 's mind works perfectly fine so it 's such a shame that at 16 - years - old she relies on me to wash and dress her			1
' we are just trying to make sure she has the best quality of life while she 's still with us			0
' doctors were at first baffled by @entity1 's symptoms but just one month later her parents were told the devastating news			1
the teenager 's health had been fine until she was 12 years old			0
but in 2011 , she developed diabetes and needed insulin with every meal			0
she then started suffering from seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy			0
her mother said : ' @entity1 's life had suddenly changed overnight and now her father and i had to help manage her health			0
' that was devastating enough , but when her seizures started getting worse , we knew something was n't adding up			0
' ' but it took years of hospital appointments before we got an accurate diagnosis - and the medication she was on failed to stop her having fits			0
' in june 2014 , @entity1 , from @entity204 , was due to undergo life - changing brain surgery to help control her seizures			2
in preparation , @entity1 needed to be taken off all medication for this to be carried out - something that led to massive , uncontrollable fits			2
mrs @entity0 added : ' it was n't until a specialist suggested that @entity1 may have mitochondrial disease that i had ever heard of it			1
' a muscle biopsy was taken and it was then confirmed that @entity1 had this horrible disease			2
' the teenager 's parents are now desperate to raise as much awareness as possible for the condition that will kill their daughter			0
they are currently waiting to go to @entity223 to talk with consultants about the best drugs available to help her			0
mrs @entity0 said : said : ' @entity1 took a massive turn for the worst in december , she suffered a huge seizure and we all thought she was going to die			1
' mitochondrial disease causes extreme tiredness , as well as involuntary movements			1
the seizures have left @entity1 with muscle weakness and she is now wheelchair bound			0
@entity1 's mother is now her full - time carer			2
she said : ' @entity1 's mind works perfectly fine so it 's such a shame that at 16 , she relies on me to wash and dress her ' desperate to spend as much time with her daughter as possible , her mother had taken up the role of @entity1 's full time carer			2
' we 're trying to get @entity1 to feed herself again , which would be amazing			2
but we do n't know what 's going to happen , so we just take each day as it comes			0
' since @entity1 's diagnosis , the family have been doing all they can to keep her spirits up			2
mrs @entity0 added : ' @entity1 recently met @entity252 which really helped lift her spirits , she loves singing so it was fantastic for her to meet her idol			1
' we 're in the process of trying to get as many people as possible to send @entity1 video messages to cheer her up , she loves @entity260			0
' despite the family struggling to cope with @entity1 's shocking diagnosis , they are sharing her story in the hope of some way improving the lives of others with the terminal condition			2
the family has spoken out to try and raise awareness of the cruel condition that has wrecked @entity273 's life mrs @entity0 said : ' @entity1 is constantly deteriorating and now that she ca n't do anything for herself			1
we are on the waiting list to get a wet room in our house			0
' originally the council placed @entity1 at the bottom of a two - year waiting list , but thanks to our supporters we are now at the top of that list			2
' but unfortunately no funding will be available until april and even then , the work is likely to exceed the maximum grants available			0
' so the family have set up a fundraising page for @entity1 in a bid to raise the vital funds for her wet room and downstairs bedroom			2
mrs @entity0 added : ' i want to ensure @entity1 has the best quality of life possible and having her own downstairs area at home would greatly improve that			1
' in just over two weeks we 've raised over £ 7,000			0
' to help the family with their fundraising , visit : @entity305 the family have pledged that any surplus funds will be donate to @entity307 , which helps research into mitochondrial disease and other metabolic disorders			1
to find out more , visit : the @entity172 .			0
