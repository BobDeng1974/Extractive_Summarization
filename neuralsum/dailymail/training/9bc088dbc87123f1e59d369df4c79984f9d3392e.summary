by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 08:31 est , 9 august 2012 @entity1 : @entity2 is friends with erotic novellist @entity4 when your granny mentions her haggard old mop bucket or tea - leaf tin , the last place you think they 'll end up is in an erotic novel			1
but for one @entity14 artist , her paintings have been immortalised in the pages of @entity16 , the saucy story that has raised eyebrows – and pulses – around the world			1
@entity2 , 40 , is good friends with the book 's author , @entity4 – real name @entity4 – whose husband is from @entity26			1
the painter says her catapult to ' mummy porn ' fame is ' surreal '			1
‘ i ’m really honoured that she put my work in the books			2
i have no @entity34 or @entity36 guilt where i ’m like , “ i ca n’t be part of an erotic book ! ” ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m just quite pleased that she liked it			0
’ her work is mentioned in all three of the books			1
in the first , a mosaic is hanging in businessman @entity16 ’s office , creating the backdrop when he meets @entity16 – who later becomes his sex slave			2
the books says : ' everything is white – ceiling , floors and walls – except for the wall by the door where a mosaic of small paintings hang			2
' thirty - six of them arranged in a square			0
a series of mundane , forgotten objects , painted in such precise detail they looked like photographs			0
' miss @entity2 , from @entity66 , said that the popular author was particularly struck by one of her works , ' looking at the overlooked ' , which comprises more than 300 smaller works on board depicting household objects			2
she said : ' @entity4 saw them when she came to a viewing of mine in @entity77 in 2006			2
it was very large , 300 pictures – she scaled it back to 36 in the book – all of very mundane objects you might see around the house			0
' the work , which is a metaphor for the mundane becoming extraordinary , is discussed by the two main characters in the book 's opening chapter			0
miss @entity2 added that the works also reflects the sordid relationship between the two characters : ' she is quite an ordinary girl , but @entity94 finds her extraordinary			0
' it is referred to again at the end of the third book @entity97 , when @entity94 recalls first meeting @entity98			0
and in the second book , @entity100 , another of @entity2 ’s paintings is donated to a charity auction			1
from household to hot stuff : @entity2 's work of everyday objects in looking at the overlooked , which is divided into 300 smaller depictions , features in the @entity16 trilogy influence : this painting , which includes depictions of teapots and mop buckets , has a starring role in the steamy novels so was miss @entity2 , whose paintings fetch from £ 715 ( € 900 ) to £ 9,500 ( € 12,000 ) , surprised by her friend 's steamy imagination ? ' well , i have to say it is very funny when you know someone quite well and you think , “ oh my goodness , you ’re into that ! ” ’ she giggles			1
' but she did most of her research online			0
she has a very happy , normal family and home life			0
' mosaics or mummy porn ? : @entity4 writes of a mosaic , similar to this one , hanging in businessman @entity16 's office capturing everyday life : the author was captivated by the 300 pictures painted by @entity2 of mundane objects found around the house the secretive painter kept her involvement in the books hidden from even family and friends			1
her @entity149 page is full of witty comments , including one from her brother @entity151 saying , ' i 'm telling @entity154 ! ' ' for now i ’m just happy for people to be seeing my work , ' shrugs @entity2			1
' that ’s what all artists want ultimately			0
' humbled : @entity2 says she is pleased her works are mentioned in the popular series turning up the heat : @entity4 - real name @entity4 - has set pulses racing with her @entity16			1
