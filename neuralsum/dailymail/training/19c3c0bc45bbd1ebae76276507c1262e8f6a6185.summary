six schools at the centre of an alleged @entity3 takeover plot are facing radical reform and even closure after being officially judged as failing , it emerged last night			1
a three - month inquiry has found the @entity9 schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated			1
one of the six , @entity14 , has been rated ‘ inadequate ’ in every criteria			0
a leaked copy of its @entity18 report says ‘ staff views are polarised ’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly			1
protest : parents at @entity9 's @entity23 after its entire governing body was sacked it found the school ’s ‘ policies have been given scant consideration ’ and its ‘ equalities policy is not fit for purpose ’			1
it adds that ‘ understanding of other religions is scant ’ and @entity35 classes focus primarily on @entity36			0
the six schools face being put into special measures by @entity18 , which investigated 21 schools in relation to an alleged ‘ @entity43 ’ takeover plot in @entity9 by @entity36 fundamentalists			1
the shocking claims – which emerged in march – were that a ‘ five - step ’ strategy had been drawn up by hardliners intent on ‘ @entity49 ’ schools by ousting unsympathetic teachers and governors			1
the allegations included claims that pupils were illegally segregated , with girls forced to sit at the back and side of classes , along with suggestions that radical preachers were invited to speak to children			1
@entity62 and the @entity63 are carrying out separate inquiries			0
@entity18 is expected to release its full findings next week , but schools have already received their individual reports			1
work : the man accused of masterminding the @entity43 plot , @entity70 , has been working as an @entity18 inspector , according to the @entity72 the chairman of governors at the centre of the alleged @entity43 plot has been working as an @entity18 inspector , it was revealed yesterday			1
@entity70 has been implicated in the conspiracy involving the alleged takeover of state schools in @entity9 by @entity36 hardliners			2
the 45 - year - old is chairman of governors at @entity86 , one of 21 schools being probed by the education watchdog , the @entity63 and @entity62			1
@entity18 yesterday confirmed that mr @entity70 has worked as an ‘ additional inspector ’			2
the watchdog uses inspectors from three private contractors and mr @entity70 ’s name appears on a list published by @entity96 , according to the @entity72			2
the tribal listing from january 2013 says mr @entity70 has been working as an inspector since 2010			0
mr @entity70 has not worked for @entity96 since may last year , but he is also listed by another contractor , @entity99 , on a document dated october 2013			0
it is understood that he has not undertaken inspections on behalf of @entity18 since this date			2
in 2007 , mr @entity70 co-authored a document for the @entity105 which called for state schools to ‘ take account of @entity36 sensitivities and sensibilities with respect to sexual morality ’ with ‘ girlfriend / boyfriend as well as homosexual relationships ’ treated as ‘ not acceptable practices according to @entity36 teaching ’			2
@entity14 was given the lowest rating in the achievement of pupils , quality of teaching , behaviour and safety of pupils and leadership and management			0
the first point made in the report is that ‘ too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views ’			0
it warns pupils are not being adequately shielded from radical views and that female teachers complained of ‘ feeling intimidated by the way in which some male members of the school community speak to them ’			1
being placed in special measures allows the @entity63 to replace the schools ’ governors and possibly senior teachers , including heads			2
closure is also an option			0
the other five schools are @entity86 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
after the allegations of the plot surfaced earlier this year , @entity18 commissioned an emergency report to investigate practices at 21 schools in @entity9 , including @entity86 ( pictured ) @entity14 , @entity86 and @entity155 are all run by the @entity156 , which , according to reports from former teachers , has been infiltrated by @entity36 hardliners			1
@entity86 ’s inadequate grade will come a little more than two years after @entity18 inspectors rated the school as outstanding in all areas and praised it for its excellent academic results and inclusivity			1
@entity86 has been condemned in recent weeks by teachers and former teachers for praising extremists in assembly and forcing girls to wear the hijab			0
a leaked department report in april warned that @entity86 had practised forced and discriminatory sex segregation and ‘ restricted ’ gcse subjects ‘ to comply with conservative @entity36 teaching ’			0
at @entity14 , five @entity177 students in @entity178 had to ‘ teach themselves ’ religious education , because the teacher gave all the time to students ‘ doing the @entity36 course ’			0
and at @entity146 , inspectors found that @entity186 children , aged ten and 11 , received no teaching at all in the arts , humanities or music			0
the department and @entity9 council are expected to release the findings of their investigations next month			0
a spokesman for @entity156 refused to comment last night			0
the leaked @entity18 reports came as 100 parents protested over the sacking of the entire governing body at the @entity23 in @entity9			2
the school was not part of @entity18 ’s @entity43 inspections , but it was placed in special measures last year after inspectors found ‘ inadequate ’ teaching , an unbalanced curriculum and governors ‘ too heavily involved in the day - to - day running ’			1
with @entity209 ’s approval , @entity9 council recently disbanded the governors and appointed a new head and ‘ interim executive board ’ to run the school .			2

three month inquiry by school watchdog found female staff were intimidated
radical governors were ' demanding prayer breaks and religious assemblies '
comes after *similar* claims that local officials knew of problem years *ago*
around 20 schools are currently being investigated by @entity18 and police
