’ by @entity8 published : 09:22 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 09:51 est , 16 july 2012 @entity10 ’s appearance on 2011 ’s celebrity big brother raised more than a few eyebrows and caused many to question her hunger for fame and her commitment to husband speaker @entity16			2
but today in a joint tv interview about their son @entity18 ’s autism @entity3 insists she has no regrets about taking part in the show that made £ 100,000 for charity			1
talking to @entity25 this morning about how her eight - year - old son inspired her to take part and raise money for autism charity , ambitious about @entity30 , @entity31 activist @entity3 says : “ that was why i did it			1
there 's no secret that @entity2 did n’t approve of me doing it			1
raising awareness : @entity3 and @entity16 appear on the @entity25 show to talk about their son 's autism ' i think he had visions of @entity45 dancing like a cat and thinking that i would do the same kind of thing			1
but it was a lot of money and to me , i just felt that i could n’t turn down that kind of money , so i have no regrets about doing it			1
' @entity2 adds : “ and it was very much @entity3 ’s decision			1
i 'm not going to be a hypocrite and pretend that i was keen on the idea			0
i thought that the programme presented hazards for her and for me , but the fact is i have always accepted that she was a free agent and that she was entitled to do it if she wanted to do so			0
' and did she do well on the programme ? she did			0
and did she raise a fortune ? she did			0
and did she do so for a magnificent charity , @entity65 about @entity30 ? she did			0
and i 'm very proud of her for that			0
' mr & mrs speaker : @entity3 and @entity2 arrive at the @entity71 studios ahead of their first joint tv interview @entity2 and @entity3 ’s eldest son @entity18 was diagnosed with autism when he was just two			1
now eight - years - old @entity18 goes to a mainstream school but has a special teaching @entity78 says : ‘ he ’s doing fantastically and he ’s a delightful little boy			2
but of course it is a lifelong condition			0
it ’s a spectrum condition , so there are all sorts of variants on the theme of autism			2
' some people are more severely affected than others , but he does experience difficulties in social communication and difficulties with social imagination and difficulties with social interaction			0
' and that will remain true lifelong , and the challenge is to find ways of addressing the difficulty and enabling him to make friends , to fulfil his potential and to enjoy life			0
' @entity103 : the couple were guests of @entity106 and prince @entity107 at the @entity108 last year the couple are hoping that talking about their son @entity18 ’s condition can help raise awareness of autism , which affects one person in every @entity116 about identifying the disorder as an infant mother - of - three @entity3 says : ' he was developing at a slower than normal rate and everybody was sort of saying , ‘ he ’ll pick up , it ’s just a different shade of normal essentially			1
’ but i just knew that there was something wrong with him			0
' @entity2 adds : ' to get confirmation and to get the label was actually useful , because apart from anything else it was the root to the sort of assistance and support he needed			2
' @entity3 is still courting controversy , mostly with her indiscreet tweets , but husband @entity2 does n’t want to be her sensor			1
she is strong - willed , but i reiterate the basic point – strong willed here in support of a fantastic cause			0
' we want to raise awareness of autism , we want to show people that they need n’t feel lonely and isolated and confused , that there can be help and that there are organisations that can provide that help			2
