the controversial action defies @entity11 's declaration of a new airspace defense zone in the region			0
the @entity2 said the flight on monday night did not prompt a response from @entity11 , and the @entity16 urged @entity8 to resolve its dispute with @entity18 over the islands diplomatically , without resorting to ' threats or inflammatory language			1
' @entity11 published coordinates for an @entity23 over the weekend and warned it would take ' defensive emergency measures ' against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly in the airspace			1
controversial : two unarmed @entity4 b - 52 bombers , like that pictured , on a training mission flew over disputed islands in the @entity7 without informing @entity8 , @entity2 officials said tuesday the zone covers most of that sea and includes the skies over islands at the heart of a territorial dispute with @entity18			1
' the policy announced by the @entity11 over the weekend is unnecessarily inflammatory , ' @entity16 spokesman @entity37 told reporters in @entity40 , where president @entity41 is traveling			1
' these are the kinds of differences that should not be addressed with threats or inflammatory language , but rather can and should be resolved diplomatically , ' he said			1
two @entity4 b - 52 bombers carried out the flight , part of a long - planned exercise , on monday night @entity52 , a @entity4 military official said			1
the lumbering bombers appeared to send a message that the @entity4 was not trying to hide its intentions and showed that @entity11 , so far at least , was unable or unwilling to defend the zone			2
the @entity57 , which have been part of the @entity60 fleet for more than half a century , are relatively slow compared with today 's more advanced fighter jets and far easier to spot than stealth aircraft			0
the dispute flared before a trip to the region by vice president @entity66 , who is scheduled to travel to @entity18 early next week and also has stops in @entity11 and @entity68			2
the @entity16 announced the trip in early november			0
the @entity7 territorial dispute will figure prominently on @entity66 's agenda			0
' we have conducted operations in the area of the @entity75			0
we have continued to follow our normal procedures , which include not filing flight plans , not radioing ahead and not registering our frequencies , ' spokesman colonel @entity76 said , using the @entity18 name for the islands			2
the @entity4 and close ally @entity18 have sharply criticized @entity11 's airspace declaration , with @entity4 defense secretary @entity83 calling it a ' destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region			1
' he said on saturday the @entity4 would not change how it operated there			0
experts said the @entity11 move was aimed at chipping away at @entity93 's claim to administrative control over the area , including the tiny uninhabited islands known as the @entity97 in @entity18 and the @entity97 in @entity11			2
islands : the @entity2 said the flight on monday night did not prompt a response from @entity11 , and the @entity16 urged @entity8 to resolve its dispute with @entity18 over the islands in the @entity7 , pictured , diplomatically , without resorting to ' threats or inflammatory language			1
' @entity18 's two biggest airlines - @entity106 and @entity107 - bowed to a @entity18 government request to stop complying with the @entity11 demands for flight plans and other information			1
they will stop providing the information on wednesday , spokesmen for the carriers said			0
by demanding airlines file flight plans or risk being intercepted by military jets , @entity11 is forcing them to effectively acknowledge @entity8 's authority over the @entity23 , which is about two - thirds the size of @entity119			1
but in persuading @entity107 , @entity106 and other carriers to ignore the zone , @entity18 's primes minister @entity120 may be calling @entity11 's bluff			0
some airlines in the region did agree to begin complying with the @entity11 identification measures			0
while @entity128 does not take a position on the sovereignty of the islands , it recognizes that @entity18 has administrative control over them and is therefore bound by treaty to defend @entity18 in the event of an armed conflict			0
the @entity2 said the training exercise ' involved two aircraft flying from @entity139 and returning to @entity139			0
' @entity76 said the @entity4 military aircraft were neither observed nor contacted by @entity11 aircraft			2
@entity11 's @entity142 said on monday it had lodged protests with the @entity4 and @entity18 embassies in @entity8 over the criticism from @entity128 and @entity93 of the zone			1
@entity11 also summoned @entity18 's ambassador , warning @entity93 to ' stop words and actions which create friction and harm regional stability , ' @entity11 's @entity147 said			0
@entity93 and @entity153 summoned @entity11 diplomats to protest			0
in addition , @entity11 sent its sole aircraft carrier on a training mission into the @entity158 on tuesday amid maritime disputes with the @entity160 and other neighbors and tension over its airspace defense zone			1
it was the first time the carrier was sent to the @entity158			0
@entity167 summoned @entity11 's ambassador to express concern over its imposition of the @entity23 over the @entity7 , the foreign minister said on tuesday , decrying the move as unhelpful in a region beset by tension .			2
