everyone has settled down in front of the television or into their bed at some point only to realise they have left the kitchen light on			0
now a new gadget will allow homeowners to flip their lights on and off using their mobile phone , without having to change all their current light fittings and switches			1
engineers have developed a device that attaches on top of traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home			1
@entity21 can be controlled using a mobile phone app over @entity33 and uses a physical toggle inside the device to move the light switch			1
imagine walking into your living room after a stressful day at work , to find the lights automatically dim themselves to suit your mood			0
it might sounds like the stuff of science fiction , but this is already possible , thanks to a gadget called @entity49			0
the device , which went on sale in the @entity52 this week , is designed to track people ’s brain waves , in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken , or monitor their heart rate			0
users wear a plastic headband across their forehead , with sensors at the front and above the ears , to track their brain activity			0
this information is then beamed via @entity33 to the user ’s mobile phone or computer , where it is ‘ translated ’ into an image of a summer ’s day in the country			1
people who have lots on their mind will see clouds rolling across the screen , whilst those who manage to empty their thoughts will be met by a clear blue sky			0
the product , developed by @entity83 , a @entity84 neuroscientist and former fashion designer , launched in @entity86 last year , and is designed to help people relax			0
it can also be linked to lighting and heating systems , in order to change the feel of a room depending on the user ’s mood			0
according to @entity97 , co-founder of @entity98 - based @entity21 , the device works like a robotic finger for the lights in your home			1
the app can be used to set timers so the lights come on at prearranged times or proximity so lights turn on when you walk into a room with your phone			1
mr @entity97 said : ' @entity21 allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone , but you can still press the button on the @entity21 face plate to manually flip the switch			1
' a lot of our users set timers to make their homes look occupied when they are away , great for making your home safer when you are on vacation			0
' you can also have the proximity setting on such that as you approach your home , your lights will turn on automatically for you			2
' many smart lighting solutions either require switches to be rewired but recently some manufacturers have developed smart bulbs that can connect to mobile phones			2
however , these take the light switch out of the loop entirely , meaning lights need to be left in the ' on ' position all the time for the bulb to work			2
@entity21 attaches to the outside of the light switch using magnets and has a button on its face allowing lights to be turned on and off as usual			2
this means that should their mobile phone run out of batteries or they are unable to connect to the device , they can still turn their lights on and off			1
the developers , who raised $ 139,000 in a successful funding crowdfunding campaign on @entity153 , are also now working on a version that connects to the internet			0
the battery powered @entity21 uses a physical toggle inside the device to flip traditional wall mounted light switches ( shown above ) - working like a robotic finger than can be controlled using a mobile phone app this means residents can turn their lights on and often while even while they are abroad on holiday			1
@entity21 is apparently compatible with two types of light switch - traditional flat ' rocker ' switches and toggle switches			2
the developers say the device is also thin enough to be used on switches on multiple switch face plates and the battery will last between eight to twelve months			2
the team behind @entity21 are currently taking pre-orders with a single unit costing $ 49 ( £ 32 )			0
however , at that price , it means kitting out the average home is unlikely to be cheap			0
the device is currently only available in the @entity181 and @entity84 , but mr @entity97 said they hoped to have it available in other countries soon			0
it also can not currently be used to control lights that use dimmer switches			1
@entity21 can be used with two different switch types - toggle switches ( left ) and rocker switches ( right ) the developers say @entity21 will be available in three different colours - gold , silver and white ( all above ) the device ( shown above ) can still be used like a traditional light switch by pressing the button in the middle mr @entity97 said they are hoping to develop new features in the coming months			1
he said : ' we designed @entity21 to make your lights smart in seconds - it snaps onto your existing light switch with magnets , connects to your phone , and allows you to automate your lights just like that			1
' because it just snaps over your light switch anyone can do it , and you can take it with you when you move in the future			0
' @entity21 allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone , but you can still press the button on the @entity21 face plate to manually flip the switch			1

@entity21 is fixed onto existing light switches using a magnetic *fastener*
the device acts like a ' robotic finger ' when controlled using a mobile phone
it can turn lights at set certain times and even detect when you are *nearby*
developers say it is more *versatile* than smart lightbulbs currently on offer
however , the device can not currently be used to control dimmer switches
