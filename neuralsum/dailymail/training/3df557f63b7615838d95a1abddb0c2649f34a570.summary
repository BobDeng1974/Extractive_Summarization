futuristic planes based on spaceships which could allow passengers to travel from @entity3 to @entity4 in two and a half hours are being developed			1
@entity6 , the space flight company owned by sir @entity8 , says that the space tourism plane it is currently developing could be modified and turned into a super jet			1
the @entity12 - like aircraft would travel outside of the @entity14 's atmosphere and enter orbit , using gravitational forces to travel at incredibly fast speeds			2
among the company 's other long - term goals are space cruise ships which could take people away from @entity14 for longer stretches			2
speaking at an event in @entity3 yesterday , commercial director @entity44 said they could serve as orbital hotels , or allow tourists to travel to the @entity49 and back			2
@entity51 co-owner @entity50 and @entity53 airline @entity52 have also teamed up to produce a similar jet which could begin flying next year			1
tickets will initially cost £ 60,000 but the pair say commercial space flight could be available within 15 - 20 years			1
the spaceship is flown into the air while strapped into the carrying craft @entity61 before detaching itself to launch into space the company says the first space tourism flight , taken by @entity8 and his family , will take place next year @entity50 's first generation spaceship , the @entity69 , will travel at 2,200 mph and he predicts it will be capable of flying four times day and doing 5,000 flights with one engine			1
so far @entity6 's @entity19 aircraft has only managed to exit the stratosphere , the second lowest part of @entity14 's atmosphere , though the company says it will launch its first flight next year			1
its manned spacecraft became the highest commercial winged vehicle to ever fly and used its shuttlecock - inspired ' feather system ' to safely re-entering the @entity14 's atmosphere			0
the company has already collected $ 80million ( £ 50m ) in deposits from 640 wealthy individuals interested in being among the first into space			0
the xerus was the model superseded by the @entity69 , a similar aircraft which the @entity51 boss hopes will provide two - hour @entity3 to @entity4 trips by 2014 however they will have to queue behind sir @entity8 himself as he and his family are due to take the first trip			1
the flight took place over the @entity23 desert and was piloted by @entity98 and @entity99 and lasted approximately an hour			0
@entity8 has also launched a tv competition show aimed at rewarding one winner with a ticket on board one of the @entity19 craft			0
by launching its craft into orbit , @entity6 will be able to harness the power of gravity to travel at extremely high speeds			2
when objects enter orbit they are actually falling towards @entity14 , but the fact that they are travelling so fast means they do n't re-enter the atmosphere			0
craft can reach such high speeds because space is a vacuum , meaning there is no air resistance to slow them down			0
the @entity6 plane would essentially ' surf ' along in orbit for a short time before using special tail flaps to force itself back down to land			0
the journey would also be much more environmentally friendly than traditional planes as it would only have to power itself along a short distance before letting orbit take over .			0

@entity6 say their @entity19 spacecraft could be modified into a jet
one day it could allow travel from @entity3 to @entity4 in just two hours
the company says it is also considering space cruises to the @entity49
space tourism flights could begin as early as next year
@entity51 boss @entity50 says he will offer @entity3 - @entity4 in two hours but it will take 15 - 20 years
