by @entity0 for @entity1 a cat - crazy couple wanted to ensure that their new kitten felt welcome when they brought him home			0
so @entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , built an assault course - style installation including ropes and a bridge for their new pet , who ended up playing on it constantly			1
little did they realise that this would lead them to open their very own online cat furniture shop , aptly called @entity22			1
and their two cats @entity24 and @entity25 quality control all their creations			1
' we were trying to design a cat wall for him to climb and could n't figure out how to bridge the gap where our hallway was			2
then it hit me ! we needed a bridge			0
' @entity7 explains that when they could not seem to find one anywhere they decided to build one for themselves			2
' since we were bringing home a kitten , we decided that it was safest to add ropes along the length of it and thus we created the @entity58			0
' little did we know that @entity24 would completely fall in love with his bridge and would be sleeping on it almost every night			2
' @entity7 and his partner started to think about whether other cats would also enjoy using a bridge			1
they added ropes along the length of a wall installation , thus creating the @entity58 @entity58 when they could not seem to find one anywhere they decided to build one for themselves his mother , who has her own shop on @entity76 , suggested that they should start up a shop on their own			1
' we started adding shelves to match our collection and it just grew from there			0
before we built our bridge , we bought several cat trees for our cats to climb on			1
' to us they all looked very similar			0
people 's living rooms do n't all look the same , so it seemed silly for them to have cat furniture that all looks the same			2
' when they first started the couple built everything in their apartment , and did all of the woodwork and sanding by hand			0
' we have now teamed up with @entity104 , a carpenter with over 20 years of wood working experience			0
@entity104 helped us make changes to all our items to ensure we were creating quality , safe cat furniture			1
' @entity7 explains that they really want their furniture to stand out and be different , along with being better looking and more functional than other cat furniture			1
they later teamed up with @entity104 , a carpenter with over 20 years of wood working experience @entity104 helped them make changes to all items to ensure they were creating quality , safe cat furniture their shop offers a water fountain , shelves and even a bridge , and all items are fully customisable their online shop offers a range of innovative platforms for cats to sleep , play and relax on , including a water fountain , shelves and even a bridge			1
all of their items are fully customisable			0
' we get so many people coming to us with custom furniture ideas that they have envisioned for their house			2
sometimes the ideas are a little too farfetched , but a lot of the time we go ahead and make the pieces			0
' we 've been lucky enough to have two very cute cats , @entity24 and @entity25 , who are very active and eager to test out our new ideas			1
when we build a new piece of furniture , they help us decide how fun or functional the piece is			0
they definitely let us know what does and does n't work			0
' we really could n't be happier doing anything else , and by no means did we think that we would be where we are now just a little over a year after starting the shop			0
' many people coming to them with custom furniture ideas that they have envisioned for their house the couple 's two cute cats @entity24 and @entity25 are very active and eager to test out new ideas			1
