by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 : 05:25 est , 1 february 2014 women in the @entity4 must breastfeed their children , or their husbands could sue them , according to a new law			1
the legislation passed this month , requires all able @entity4 women to breastfeed their children for at least two years			1
the @entity10 included a clause in the new @entity12 which states that it is a human right for a child to be breast fed , and that nursing is now mandatory			1
mandatory breast : according to the new @entity12 , women in the @entity4 must breast feed their children as nursing is a ' human right ' written into the @entity19 however , the @entity4 ’s minister of social affairs , @entity20 , said the fact that breastfeeding is now forced upon women , could lead to husbands suing their wives if they do not follow the law			1
‘ this part of the law can be a burden , ’ ms @entity20 told @entity27			0
‘ if the law forced women to breastfeed , this could lead to new court cases			2
’ the @entity12 was passed by the @entity33 earlier this month , and the breastfeeding clause added once it was put up for review			2
@entity36 said that it was the right of all children to be breastfed up to the age of two , and that it is a duty and not an option for any woman able to do so			0
the decision was backed up by research which show that breast feeding is beneficial both for a child 's future health , but also for the bond between mother and baby , while other members referred to parts of the @entity19 which states that a mother should nurse			0
thinly veiled threat : the new law proposes that should an @entity4 woman not breastfeed her child for two years , her husband would have legal backing to sue her if a mother is unable to breastfeed for a biological reason , the state should support her by providing a wet nurse , but it has not been explained how this system is to be implemented			1
several groups supporting new parents reacted strongly to the new breastfeeding law , including out of the @entity69 , a @entity71 organisation helping mothers suffering from postnatal issues			0
' as a group we wholeheartedly agree that breastfeeding should be encouraged and that the sentiment is a good one that clearly follows international guidelines , ' the group wrote in an open letter in @entity27			0
' however , as many of the new mothers we encounter are already under significant pressure , we are concerned that enacting a law that leaves mothers facing potential punishment could be a step too far			0
' the group also pointed out that is has not been made clear who will be responsible for assessing who is and is not able to breastfeed , especially as lactation specialists can be hard to find in the @entity4 .			2

the @entity94 passes @entity12
the law includes a clause requiring mothers to breastfeed
@entity4 mothers must breastfeed children for at least two years
law could lead to husbands suing their wives if they do not
