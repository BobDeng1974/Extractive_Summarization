secrecy : @entity1 died in 2012			1
the council wanted to keep all facts about the death and the name of the child from public knowledge for 15 years facts about the death of a 13 - month - old girl should be kept a secret because of the risk of embarrassment to social workers or police officers , a council demanded in court			1
lawyers for @entity20 tried to suppress all information about the death of @entity1 on the grounds it would be unfair to reveal shortcomings of public agencies , it was revealed yesterday			1
details of how the local authority pressed for the death to be hushed up to protect its own staff were made public as high court judge mr justice @entity31 ruled that the facts must still remain secret , nearly two years after @entity1 died			1
the judge said this was to prevent interference with any future criminal trial and to avoid identification of @entity1 ’s five siblings			1
however , the information blackout demanded by lawyers for @entity42 went much further and was aimed at protecting its own staff from criticism , according to the papers highlighted by the judge yesterday			1
in its call for secrecy in july , the council wanted to keep all facts about the death and the name of the child from public knowledge for 15 years			2
the council ’s demands at a family court fact - finding hearing ‘ would have had the effect of concealing for the next 15 years the names of any of the family members , including the child that died and any of the agencies concerned and the geographical area in which the events occurred ’			2
the council ’s legal submissions aimed at restricting access to any information warned that ‘ disclosure of alleged shortcomings by agencies might be unfair to the agencies ’			1
the continued secrecy over @entity1 ’s death in december 2012 comes against a background of a troubled police investigation			1
police inquiries into the circumstances of the death are still ongoing			0
a man and a woman have been arrested , but the police inquiry itself is now under investigation and an officer has been suspended			0
the official reticence surrounding the case has attracted growing criticism in recent days			0
@entity1 ’s name was unknown until last week , when an inquest recorded an open verdict and a coroner described her death as ‘ unusual and strange ’			1
demanding action : @entity96 mp @entity95 , who campaigns against secrecy practised by social workers and the courts , said nothing appears to have happened in the nearly two years since @entity1 's death @entity96 mp @entity95 , who campaigns against secrecy practised by social workers and the courts , said : ‘ it is reasonable to hold back publication of information until a criminal trial is over			1
‘ however in the case of the death of @entity111 , @entity112 , it took little more than a year for the people responsible to be prosecuted and convicted			0
in this case nothing appears to have happened after nearly two years			0
’ mr @entity95 added : ‘ it is very clear in the case of @entity1 that the authorities are putting all the effort they can into ensuring that none of their failings become public			2
as usual , they justify this by saying it is in the interest of children , when really it is in the interest of paid employees of the state			0
‘ the real interest of children is in seeing those employees held properly to account			0
’ mr @entity136 said in the @entity137 yesterday that he would make a ‘ limited ’ order banning publication of information about the death			0
he said this was ‘ essential ’ to allow any criminal prosecution to take place without interference and without prejudice to the trial			2
the second reason was that if @entity1 ’s siblings were identified publicly it would harm them			2
the judge said : ‘ i will consider whether the fact - finding judgement can be published as soon as it is possible to do so			0
’ @entity20 said it was ‘ unable to comment at this time ’			0

@entity1 was 13 months old when she died in december 2012
judge *imposed* orders stopping details of baby 's death from being revealed
he said it was to prevent interference with any future criminal trial
also argued that it was to avoid the identification of @entity1 's five siblings
but information blackout was aimed at protecting council staff from criticism
