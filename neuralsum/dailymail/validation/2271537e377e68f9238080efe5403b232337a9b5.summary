@entity0 has ruthlessly mocked @entity2 campaign for the company 's new anti-racism campaign in which baristas talk to customers about race issues while serving their coffee			1
one user tweeted , ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train ' , while another pointed out , ' y'all realize there are no coloured hands in the press photos right '			1
a third speculated , ' maybe @entity2 actually wanted to get people of all races & ethnicities to join hands and make fun '			1
but @entity0 has branded the campaign ' cringe - inducing ' and ' patronizing ' humiliation : @entity46 , @entity2 ' senior vice president of @entity47 was forced to delete his account due to ' a cascade of negativity ' @entity46 , the company 's senior vice president of @entity47 , was forced to delete his @entity0 account , before re-activating it the next day			1
' last night i felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity , ' he said in a post on medium			2
' i got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion , and i reacted '			1
staff at the 4,700 cafés across @entity36 now have the option to write ' @entity29 ' on cardboard cups , which is the slogan of a @entity2 anti-racism campaign			1
it was hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup would be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting @entity36 , in an attempt to ' create a more empathetic and inclusive society - one conversation at a time '			2
but many customers found the campaign ' patronizing '			1
' # @entity29 is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life " white man 's burden " crisis , ' one user tweeted			1
another took a sarcastic approach , tweeting a picture of a white barista , with the message : ' here 's your macchiato ! let 's discuss the historic disenfranchisement of your people that has allowed me to prosper			0
' the campaign was the brainchild of @entity27 , 61 , the company 's boss , who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics , from gay marriage to gun control			1
his decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of @entity111 , 18 , in @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , 43 , in @entity115 , @entity116			0
last year , @entity117 travelled to @entity2 branches in the cities most affected by racial tension , including @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity116 , @entity124 and @entity125			2
mr @entity126 met about 2,000 @entity2 staff on the tour , and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address			1
' it 's an emotional issue , ' he said			0
' but it is so vitally important to the country			0
' last week , the company ran full - page advertisements in the @entity140 and @entity141 , highlighting race tensions in the country			0
the page was black , with the words ' shall we overcome ? ' in the centre , and the company logo at the bottom			0
the campaign will continue on friday , when every copy of @entity141 will carry an insert about racism , which will also be stocked at branches of @entity2			1
@entity117 kicked off the campaign last december with a letter that appeared in @entity157			0
' last week , one thing became clear : we can not continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation , and not acknowledge them , together , as a company , ' he wrote			0
' indeed , despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues , we at @entity2 should be willing to talk about them			2
' @entity117 has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart			0
in 2013 , he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores , even in states where they can be carried legally			0
' we believe guns and weapons should not be part of the @entity2 experience , ' he said			2
he also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year , and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the @entity36 by selling bracelets in its cafés in 2011			0
@entity2 is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years			2
it is not known whether @entity2 is considering pulling the @entity29 campaign			1
traditionally , those who oppose @entity117 ' views get short shrift : in 2013 , when an investor said that the company 's open support for gay marriage was harming sales , @entity117 responded by suggesting that he sell his shares .			0

@entity27 , boss of @entity2 , told baristas to write ' @entity29 ' on cups in an effort to stimulate debate about racism
@entity0 users *quickly* branded the campaign ' patronizing ' and ' cringe - inducing ' , and *subjected* **executive*s* to a wave of mockery
one user pointed out that no black people featured in publicity photographs for the campaign
@entity46 , a @entity2 pr *executive* , was forced to delete his @entity0 account as he felt ' overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion '
