by @entity1 reporter published : 12:49 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 19 august 2013 for much of the nine years that @entity3 worked on his @entity5 documentary and book , the project was a mystery worthy of the author himself			1
until 2010 , when @entity14 novelist died at age 91 , only a handful of people were fully aware of what he was up to			2
even now , with the release date of the film @entity5 less than three weeks away , little is known about a production that draws upon more than 100 interviews and a trove of documents and rare photographs , and that promises many revelations about an author who still fascinates millions			1
‘ i have worked more than 200 documentaries in my career and @entity5 was the most secretive and the most intense film i have ever worked on , ’ said @entity33 , the film 's cinematographer and co-producer who has worked on such @entity37 documentaries as @entity38 and the @entity39			1
‘ it was run like a @entity54 operation			0
everything was compartmentalized , top secret and on a need - to - know basis			0
’ more than three years after @entity5 's death at his @entity62 home , numerous questions remain unanswered , notably what – or if – he wrote during the self - imposed retirement of his final decades			1
the new @entity5 book and movie are not the first projects ever billed as cracking the @entity5 code , and the author 's literary estate did not participate			1
but @entity71 has won some important converts			0
the @entity73 quickly signed up the movie after seeing it earlier this year , as did @entity76 , which reportedly paid seven figures and will air the documentary in january as the 200th installment of its ‘ @entity82 ’ series			0
@entity83 reportedly paid seven figures for the book , which runs 700 pages and was co-authored by @entity71 and @entity86			0
revelations ? an undated photo shows @entity5 near his @entity62 home with his @entity91 editor 's wife @entity89			1
rumors are swirling that the new film will reveal previously unknown details about the writer the film , which opens september 6 , is expected to be shown on more than 200 screens nationwide , a high number for a documentary			1
the book 's planned first printing is for more than 100,000 copies			0
@entity71 , 40 , is best known as a screenwriter , with credits that include ‘ @entity105 ’ and a planned sequel for ‘ @entity107			1
’ @entity71 , who declined to be interviewed , reportedly spent some $ 2 million of his own money for the project and traveled around the country and in @entity112 to research it			0
as if internalizing the @entity5 legend , he made secrecy not just a priority , but an obsession			1
virtually everyone involved had to sign non-disclosure agreements , including @entity86 , @entity48 and @entity121 , and even @entity33 ' wife			0
at @entity124 , where post production took place , the film was called ‘ @entity131 ’ and stored in a vault , as if in homage to the vault where @entity5 allegedly stored unpublished manuscripts			1
the @entity124 vault was kept in a room under the watch of seven surveillance cameras			0
recluse : pictured is the @entity138 , @entity62 home of the reclusive writer			2
he died here in 2010 lock and key : @entity5 reads from his classic novel @entity14 in this 1952 photo			1
like the writer , the documentary 's filmmakers worked in total secrecy for fear of internet leaks and of alienating their informants the film 's ending was added just in the past few days			1
‘ everything was on a very strict ` need to know ' basis and the only person who knew everything by design was @entity3 , ’ @entity33 said			1
‘ crew members knew about their part and not other parts of the film			2
some crew members brought on for a particular sequence walked away thinking they made a film about @entity167 or 1940s @entity169 or @entity168			2
promotion : the poster for @entity3 's documentary film @entity5 mimics a paperback copy of one of the author 's books , with all their requisite plainness ‘ this was the first film in my career , ’ he added , ‘ where i checked into hotels under a fake name			1
’ there have been reasons all along to value secrecy			0
the @entity5 crew worried that early publicity would make some interview subjects reluctant to talk			1
they also cited the example of the @entity192 documentary ‘ @entity195 , ’ which leaked online in advance of its release			0
for @entity5 , emails were often sent under fake headers and online correspondence in general was minimized			2
whether working on the book with @entity86 , or recruiting associates for the film , @entity71 preferred handling business in person			2
‘ when @entity3 first called to hire me , he did not tell me the subject matter of the film			1
he just said ` if i get you a plane ticket , will you come to @entity211 to talk with me about a film project ? ' ‘ @entity33 said			2
‘ after i arrived in @entity211 and signed a phone book size confidentiality agreement , @entity3 revealed to me that he was underway with a film about @entity5			1
’ ‘ for years i could n't tell anyone what i was working on , ’ @entity48 said			0
‘ it was n't just friends			0
my own family did n't know ! ’ access was restricted even for the movie 's soundtrack composer , @entity220 , who won a @entity222 for his score for ‘ @entity224			0
’ in liner notes he wrote for the @entity5 soundtrack cd , @entity220 recalled that his job was ‘ very complicated ’ in part because he had to score many scenes he was not permitted to see			2
once press screenings begin for @entity5 , and copies of the books are shipped to stores , keeping all the secrets could prove highly challenging , especially in the age of @entity236			1
@entity238 publicity head @entity237 ( no relation to company founders @entity241 and @entity242 ) said journalists seeing the movie will be asked to sign an embargo agreement			0
@entity246 , who heads @entity83 's flagship imprint , said the publisher was taking ‘ extraordinary measures ’ to ensure early copies were not sold or obtained			0
no advance editions will be sent to the media and stores will be required to sign agreements not to sell the book before its sept. 3 release date			0
but publishing embargos have rarely held , even for such highly restricted releases as the final ‘ @entity264 ’ book and @entity261 's biography of @entity262 , a @entity83 release			0
@entity246 acknowledged that he had doubts over how long the @entity5 book would remain unseen , saying that it could well become public a few days early .			2

the secrets will finally come out when the film by @entity105 writer @entity3 is released september 6
film features commentary from famous @entity5 fans like @entity275 , @entity276 , and @entity277
