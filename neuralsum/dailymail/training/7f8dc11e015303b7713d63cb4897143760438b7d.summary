by @entity0 they are the billion dollar couple whose marriage has been a carefully orchestrated affair - even down to the announcement of their first child live on tv			1
but as rumors continue to swirl surrounding an impending split between @entity12 and @entity13 , sources tell @entity14 the rapper is desperate to save his marriage and plans to whisk his superstar wife away on a five - week ' make or break ' vacation in between their final tour dates			1
a source revealed that @entity12 is trying to persuade @entity13 - who is now looking at apartments in both @entity23 and @entity24 - to join him , saying : ' @entity12 wants to save the marriage , they have their final @entity28 tour date in @entity29 on august 6 and then they have two dates in @entity32 from september 12 - that 's it			1
' he adores his daughter @entity34 and he wants a sibling for her , but @entity13 is n't sure what she wants to do - their marriage is in flux , that 's the truth			1
@entity12 just wants them to spend some time alone together to try and work it out			2
the couple put on a good show in @entity47 on wednesday night smiles : despite their grins as last night 's gig , @entity13 still changed the lyrics of her song , @entity59 , further fueling rumors of marital strife - and is not wearing a wedding ring ( ringed ) ' and it 's not just throwing away a marriage - it 's throwing away a brand			1
but it may be that @entity66 has just had enough			2
she has some trust issues with @entity12			2
' the couple are currently on the @entity70 on their @entity71 , from which they stand to earn up to $ 120 million			0
the source said their marriage has not been the same since they became parents and settled down to family life with their daughter , now two			0
the stress is said to have led them to a point where @entity13 yet again hinted at marital strife			2
at their concert at @entity47 's @entity46 on wednesday night , she once more changed the lyrics to her 2006 song , @entity59 - and was clearly seen without a wedding band			1
during the song , which is about a cheating scandal , she altered the track to reflect the current length of her romance with the rapper , singing : ' been ridin ' with you for twelve years			0
why did i deserve to be treated this way by you ? ' the original lyric should read : '' been ridin ' with you for six years			0
' she also changed the line , ' like i could n't do it for you like your mistress could '' to ' like i could n't do it for you like that wack b * * * h could			0
' and for now , @entity13 keeps on staff her veteran bodyguard @entity111 , who remains one of her closest ' confidants ' and ' knows everything , ' according to the source			1
indeed , it was was @entity111 , a @entity117 , believed to be a divorced father - of - one , who prevented @entity13 's younger sister @entity119 from attacking @entity12 in her new infamous elevator attack at a bash following the @entity122 in may			1
despite reports that the furious row between @entity119 and @entity12 was over his close friendship with singer @entity127 , a source claimed that his relationship with his former protégé is not believed to be romantic			2
if the most powerful couple in music do divorce , one thing is for certain - @entity13 has certainly got control of all of her hard - earned cash			2
in december 2013 , following the surprise release of her self - titled visual album , she made it clear : ' i started my own company			0
' referring to @entity141 , the entertainment and management company she founded in 2008 after parting ways with her longtime manager , father @entity144 , she told fans at a private screening at @entity23 's @entity147 : ' when i decided to manage myself it was important that i did n’t go to some big management company			2
' i felt like i wanted to follow the footsteps of @entity151 and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career you do n’t have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success - you do it yourself			0
' according to a longtime @entity23 attorney , the couple would certainly have a pre-nup in place following their @entity168 wedding on april 4 , 2008 @entity170 , a noted matrimonial and family lawyer , told @entity14 : ' if these people did n't have a pre-nuptial agreement they ought to see a psychiatrist - not a lawyer ! confidante : @entity13 's longtime bodyguard @entity111 , who stopped @entity119 from attacking @entity12 in the infamous elevator row following the @entity122 in may , is said to be her confidant			1
he 's seen here , top right , ushering the superstar , her sister and husband out of the party by her side : @entity111 is currently on tour with @entity13 and @entity12 he 's seen with @entity66 at the @entity122 and again as she leaves a @entity168 office building in june ' my favorite hue is @entity188 ' : @entity189 posted a heartwarming @entity191 snap on monday of her husband cradling their daughter @entity34 on a picturesque beach apartment hunting : sources reveal that apart from looking at @entity23 properties , @entity13 is also looking in @entity24 as well			1
the couple are seen on stage in @entity47 on wednesday night ' but there are some who believe that true love conquers all , sometimes people are romantic - look at @entity207 and @entity208 , people can be irrational			1
' i do n't think this is the case here however , you 're dealing with two people who are extremely savvy , it 's all about business			0
' the pair own a string of properties , including the 8,309 - square - foot penthouse at 195 @entity220 in @entity221 , @entity168 in september 2004 for $ 6.85million - and now valued at considerably more			2
and mr @entity170 said : ' in cases where there is lots of money , it 's much easier to resolve			0
when there 's a lot of money on the table , it 's easier to draw a line			0
money is a strange commodity , the more you have , the less important it is			0
' and with the pre-nup , that really ends any arguments			0
' the lawyer pointed out the couple could file in any state where they own a home - not just @entity23 , so they could pick a state with minimal exposure to ensure they maintain control			2
asked about a potential custody arrange for @entity12 and @entity66 's daughter , mr @entity170 said : ' this would be no ordinary divorce , there would be no father fighting to keep his child in state , these people have private planes - they could be living in @entity258 ! ' for the moment , the couple are not believed to be shopping around for divorce lawyers - and sources maintain that a split , if it happens , would not be announced until the end of the tour at the @entity265 in @entity32 in september			1
on the rocks ? @entity189 - pictured in @entity267 with husband @entity12 and @entity34 - has hinted at marriage troubles as she changed the lyrics in a song about cheating during her performance on the couples @entity71 in @entity273 last month - and again in @entity47 on wednesday night surfboard , surfboard : @entity189 shared a photo of herself laying across the flat ocean rider she famously sings about in @entity278 in an @entity191 snap on saturday - again , without a wedding band on her finger bachelorette pad ? @entity13 is believed to have viewed this @entity284 apartment , on sale for $ 21.5million without @entity12 perhaps what will be extremely telling will be any appearance the couple make at this year 's @entity289 on august 24 , in @entity290 , @entity291			1

what is indeed certain is @entity13 's bid to keep up appearances - this week she posted a cute @entity191 snap of @entity311 , with the note : ' my favorite hue is @entity188 ' - although privately it seems she 's most definitely making plans for a fresh start without @entity12			1
as the @entity319 reported this week , the superstar has been secretly shopping for new digs without @entity12 - viewing a $ 21.5 million @entity284 penthouse early last month just weeks after the elevator incident			2
the 4,045 - square - foot @entity324 19th street property is still a far cry from the couple 's sprawling loft , and a source said : ' she was very quiet , as if she was looking on the sly			0
' working : @entity189 shared this image of her and @entity12 during their @entity331 show , featuring her sitting on a higher platform than him and @entity14 has learned that the superstar singer has also been looking at properties in @entity24			1
calling time on the marriage , a source told the @entity319 : ' there ’s still something there , even though it ’s not going to last			0
business is always part of the equation			0
they know they ’re the king and queen of hip - hop - and really , all of music			0
neither wants to lose that			0
' the insider also alleged : ' knowing them as i do , obviously there ’s a little something to certain rumors			0
when your man or your woman is n’t getting it done for you , and i ’m talking emotionally , not necessarily sexually … they keep things quiet			0
' @entity365 : @entity189 and @entity12 were every bit the power couple as they performed in @entity331 on thursday night for their joint @entity371 tour while on stage in front their adoring fans , the stars seem unruffled by rumours their marriage is in trouble			1
meanwhile , eagle - eyed fans have picked up , @entity13 has removed the @entity380 on her wedding finger and if that does n't signify the end of a starry marriage , what else does .			1
