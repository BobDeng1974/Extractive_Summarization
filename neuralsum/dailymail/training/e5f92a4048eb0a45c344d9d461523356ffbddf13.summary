by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 03:19 est , 27 july 2012 new gold standard : professor @entity2 said the new chart could potentially transform patient safety in @entity6 hospitals the lives of at least 6,000 hospital patients could be saved each year by using a standard scoring system that alerts doctors and nurses to their deteriorating condition			1
a score of seven or more out of ten on a patient ’s chart would result in their immediate transfer to specialist care			1
at present one in 20 deaths in hospital is rated as preventable , caused by factors such as poor monitoring and dehydration , where staff failed to act soon enough			2
the @entity25 says half of these deaths could be avoided if all hospital staff used the same national early warning score to trigger immediate action			2
there are more than 100 different types of chart where patients ’ vital signs are recorded , sometimes several times a day			1
but there should be only one system used by all staff who check on patients ’ conditions – whether they are in hospitals , care homes or in ambulances , says the rcp			1
the system would mean doctors and nurses could move between hospitals without having to learn how to read a new chart			1
the chart records vital signs such as pulse , temperature and blood pressure , giving each a score			1
the doctor or nurse adds up the score every time the vital signs are recorded , meaning they can recognise immediately the severity of illness and whether the patient needs closer monitoring , or transfer to critical care units			2
the score depends on how much variation there is in a patient ’s condition			0
a medium score of five or six would alert a doctor or nurse to the need for an urgent assessment of the patient			0
a high score of seven or more would usually result in urgent transfer to more specialist facilities			0
because the doctor is alerted instantly to the score when they check a patient ’s vital signs , action is less likely to be delayed when a patient starts to deteriorate			0
having the same new chart ( pictured ) would mean nurses and doctors could move between hospitals without having to learn a new system @entity2 , chairman of the working party that developed the chart , said a study of 1,000 adults dying in acute hospitals in @entity96 and @entity97 estimated 5 per cent of the deaths were preventable – 12,000 a year			1
he predicted around half the deaths could have been avoided using the standardised score for recognising very sick patients whose condition is worsening			2
‘ many changes in healthcare are incremental but this new national early warning score has the potential to transform patient safety in our hospitals and improve patient outcomes , it is hugely important , ’ said professor @entity2			2
doctors and nurses could be easily trained on the scoring system , which should become part of undergraduate medical education , he said			1
@entity118 of the @entity119 said : ‘ there is nothing nurses and doctors should prioritise more than patient safety , and this system , if implemented across the board , will be a great leap forward for patient care			1
‘ excellent systems for recognising patient deterioration do exist in many care settings , and have undoubtedly saved many lives			0
however , this is the first time clinical expertise and experience have come together to standardise the best of that practice			0
‘ i hope that every trust will adopt this system as soon as possible , as countless lives could be saved in the future by adopting this simple process			0
’ several trusts have already approached the @entity25 because they want to use the system			0
@entity145 , chief executive of @entity146 , said the new system should be introduced urgently			0
she said the public would be shocked to learn that the @entity150 had ‘ been operating such an ad hoc system ’ .			0

currently more than 100 different types of charts to monitor patients in the @entity6
one standard chart would help nurses and doctors when they move hospitals
