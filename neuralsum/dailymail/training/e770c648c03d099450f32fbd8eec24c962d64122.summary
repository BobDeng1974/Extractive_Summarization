a mother is urging young people to think before they ink as she wishes she 'd never had a giant tattoo drawn on her chest at the age of 18			1
full - time mother @entity6 , 25 , from @entity7 , bitterly regrets having the colourful diamond with butterfly wings and a crown emblazoned on her cleavage			1
she said the tattoo was an act of teenage rebellion following a strict @entity16 upbringing but admits it no longer fits her look or lifestyle			1
act of teenage rebellion : @entity6 , 25 , now regrets the giant tattoo she had when she was 18 as an act of rebellion against her @entity16 upbringing speaking on the documentary @entity25 , which airs on @entity26 tonight , she said : ' i was a wild child when i was a teenager but i 'm far from that now			1
' as soon as i turned 18 , i wanted to do what i wanted , i smoked and took drugs			2
' i wanted to be different and stand out so i had the tattoo			2
at the time i thought it was really cool and was pleased everyone would be able to see it			0
' but after getting married and having a son , now three , @entity6 said she no longer loves the permanent reminder of her past			1
the wife and mother thought the tattoo was ' cool ' when she first had it done but now she regrets it the inking is hard to conceal , as illustrated when @entity6 met @entity25 presenter @entity45 to be interviewed for the @entity26 documentary and it can still be seen above her high neck dress ' when i had my son , that was the nail in the coffin for me , ' she explains			1
' watching him lying on my naked chest by my tattoo , i just wished it was n't there			2
' the tattoo is difficult for @entity6 to conceal unless she wears a roll neck top and she often feels like she is being judged when people see it			1
she said : ' people must look at me and think i 'm a crazy mum or a bad person			0
' as @entity6 's son gets older , she intends to go back to university and then train to be a midwife , but she feels the tattoo could also hold her back in a nursing career			1
she said : ' can you imagine when i walk into the room to help deliver a baby and the first thing they see is my huge tattoo ? ' they will think i 'm crazy			2
midwives wear a v - neck uniform and it will show			0
' @entity6 appears on @entity25 to urge other young people to carefully consider whether they really want a tattoo and to remember that they will have to live with it forever			1
after several rounds of painful laser removal surgery , the tattoo is slowly becoming fainter , much to @entity6 's relief the tattoo is less obvious above her top when @entity6 meets @entity45 after the laser removal treatment she said of her decision : ' when i had it done when i was 18 , i really did n't care about my future			1
' now i look at myself in the mirror and i hate it			0
i liked this design seven years ago but now it does n't mean anything to me			0
' @entity6 is so desperate to have the mistake erased , she is willing to endure painful laser removal surgery			2
there is no guarantee the treatment will fully work but after two sessions , she can begin to tell the difference as some of the colours and lines are fainter			0
speaking of the treatment she said : ' it 's like having an electric shock			0
' people think " if i get a tattoo i do n't like , i 'll just get it removed " but it 's not that simple			0
' i look in the mirror now and get frustrated as it 's not completely removed , so now it looks like a very bad tattoo			0
' i just have to keep telling myself - focus , it is going to go and then it will look fab			0
' @entity25 : nips , @entity117 and tattoos is on @entity26 wednesdays at 10pm			0

@entity6 , 25 , from @entity7 , had a giant tattoo inked on her chest aged 18
the move was an act of rebellion against her strict @entity16 upbringing
but she now bitterly regrets her decision after becoming a mother
