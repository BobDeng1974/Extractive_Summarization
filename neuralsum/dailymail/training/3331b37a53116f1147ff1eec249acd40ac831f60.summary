by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 10 june 2013 oblivious to passers - by , lost in their own amorous bubble , the pair gaze into each others ’ eyes and then move in for a kiss			0
she slips her hand round his waist and he clasps the world ’s best known behind ... on the evidence of this very public display of affection on a @entity18 street after they had played tennis at the weekend , @entity12 and her boyfriend @entity13 simply ca n’t keep their hands off each other			1
so , just who is the beau with the bright blue eyes ? well , it seems @entity28 has finally landed a man who might just prove to be a keeper			0
couple : @entity12 and her banker boyfriend @entity13 embrace after playing tennis together smooch : the couple kiss passionately in @entity18 's summer sun before going their separate ways @entity13 , a 35 - year - old grammar - school educated stockbroker working in the @entity18 office of @entity42 , is tall , handsome , sporty and solvent			1
and while most englishmen cringe at the thought of a public hug — @entity46 , @entity12 ’s most recent significant ex , was said to be miserable in the spotlight and certainly always looked it — @entity13 appears not to care who sees him kissing @entity12			1
indeed , he seems to revel in walking around arm in arm with her , or even hand in hand , suggesting he is both very keen on her and cheerfully unbothered by publicity			0
perfect match : @entity12 with @entity13 after a game of tennis the fact that he ’s not titled or aristocratic has surprised some , given @entity12 ’s previous boyfriends have had rather grand connections			1
some observers maintained that the 29 - year - old — whose @entity65 university friends were known as the ‘ @entity67 ’ because their families all owned one — was after a big country house and a title to compete with her sister			0
after all , she did share a flat at university with two @entity78 ’ sons : @entity79 , heir to the @entity80 , and @entity81 , son of the @entity82			0
in for the kill : the pair share an amorous moment in a @entity18 street and recently there was @entity88 , the clothing entrepreneur for whose party she dressed as a saucy @entity91 and was photographed the next day in a car in which a friend of the @entity94 was brandishing a gun ( fake , as it turned out )			1
column : @entity12 has recently started writing for @entity97 but her relationship with @entity13 certainly seems to be serious			1
@entity13 was born to retailer @entity99 and his second wife , @entity102 - born @entity101 , a former au pair for whom @entity13 , 64 , had left his first wife @entity91			1
@entity101 , known as ‘ @entity104 ’ , has declared herself to be ‘ very pleased ’ with the relationship between her son and @entity12 , describing it as ‘ perfect ’			1
@entity104 and @entity99 run a fashion and sportswear shop , called @entity110 , in @entity111 , @entity112 , and live nearby in a mock @entity114 terrace where @entity13 was raised with his sister @entity115			1
@entity110 sells high - end skiwear and @entity118 boots , among other things — the whole @entity120 , like the @entity121 , are mad about skiing			0
@entity13 went to a local @entity124 primary school and then the selective @entity125 in @entity111			1
he played football , cricket and tennis for the school and then read business at @entity131 , winning a place on the advertising agency @entity133 ’s graduate trainee scheme before moving into banking			0
one fellow financier says : ‘ @entity13 is funny , sharp , oozes charm and never loses his cool			2
i think he ’s very ambitious but he wears it lightly			0
' @entity13 has made money at @entity42			2
last summer he sold a flat in @entity18 ’s leafy , white stucco @entity140 square for £ 1.56 million			2
before that , he lived in the @entity146 stomping ground of @entity147 in @entity18			2
@entity13 has already been to @entity148 with the @entity149 and @entity150 and @entity151 — surely the ultimate sign of approval			2
they flew from @entity148 to @entity155 in @entity156 , where they were seen ‘ aggressively snogging ’ in a bar , according to an onlooker			0
then , in march , there was more very public smooching in @entity162 at a ski marathon in which both competed			0
and at 35 , @entity13 is the age at which even bachelor bankers start to think about marriage			0

@entity13 put a cheeky hand on @entity12 's behind as they kissed in @entity18
the couple have been dating for about eight months
