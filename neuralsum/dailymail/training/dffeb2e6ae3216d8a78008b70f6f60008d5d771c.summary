@entity4 mp @entity36 this week slammed the payments , telling his local paper the @entity39 : ' the only time tat translations really are justifiable at that expense is when a large number of people will benefit from it			1
' @entity46 translations which cost that amount are not appropriate ( and ) i 'm concerned it appears as though the council is pursuing that sort of approach			0
' @entity52 , the secretary of state for communities and local government , says councils should cut back spending on needless translations the chair of @entity59 in @entity4 , @entity57 said the payments were ' a joke ' , adding : " is that person paying council tax ? is that person working and contributing to the town ? ' i just fee that so many people are struggling to pay their council tax will read this and see where their money is going - and be absolutely outraged			1
' the council was slammed in 2012 after it was revealed it stumped up £ 628 to translate it 's @entity9 magazine into @entity3 , with @entity52 , the secretary of state for communities and local government , saying councils should cut back spending on needless translations			1
he said at the time : ' some local authorities translate a range of documents into languages spoken by their residents , and provide interpretation services			0
' while there may be rare occasions in which this is entirely necessary - for instance in emergency situations - i am concerned such services are in many cases being provided unnecessarily			0
' such translation services have an unintentional , adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn @entity97			0
' i understand in @entity4 a single person complained			1
' the gentleman concerned would be well advised to learn @entity97 and become an integrated citizen			0
' local @entity101 , 43 , said : ' i could understand it if it was a for a large number of people , but for just one person £ 1,000 is totally unacceptable			1
