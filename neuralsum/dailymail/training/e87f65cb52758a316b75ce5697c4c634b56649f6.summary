by @entity0 the number of @entity3 adults with diabetes has risen to more than 3.2 million – up by a million in just seven years			1
new figures show 163,000 people were diagnosed with the condition last year , the biggest total in a year since 2008			0
this brings the total to 3,208,014 adults with diabetes – or one in 17 of the population			1
in 2006 , the figure was 2.2 million			2
worrying : the reason behind the alarming spike in cases is @entity3 's growing obesity crisis			1
file picture a further 850,000 are thought to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes , according to charity @entity20 , which blames the ‘ unfolding public health disaster ’ on the country ’s obesity crisis			1
nine out of ten people with diabetes have @entity27 , which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , leading to high levels which can damage organs			2
it is strongly linked to being overweight and unhealthy diets			1
the @entity35 spends £ 14 billion a year – 10 per cent of its budget – treating diabetes and its complications			2
the @entity35 spends £ 14bn a year treating diabetes and it complications			0
pictured , a blood test to detect diabetes every year in @entity42 and @entity43 , 24,000 people with diabetes die earlier than expected , a situation that is expected to get even worse without urgent action			0
diabetes @entity3 wants local @entity35 organisations to fully implement the @entity48 , which should be offered to everyone aged 40 to 74 , to help identify people at high risk of type 2 diabetes			1
chief executive @entity53 said : ‘ the big increase in the number of people with diabetes confirms that we are in the middle of an unfolding public health disaster that demands urgent action			2
it is frightening to think that one in 17 people has been diagnosed			0
‘ firstly , we need more focus on preventing type 2 diabetes , as this is the only way we can bring the rapid rise in diabetes cases under control			1
this means properly implementing the @entity48 so we can identify more people at high risk , and then making sure they get the support they need to reduce that risk			0
‘ we also need to address the obesity crisis , which is what is fuelling the increase in @entity27 , by making healthy food cheaper and more accessible and by making it easier for people to build physical activity into their daily lives			0
‘ but as well as doing more to prevent type 2 , we need to get much better at treating diabetes because the level of priority the @entity35 gives the condition does not reflect the size of the shadow it is casting over our nation ’s health			1
‘ the result is that while diabetes is hugely expensive , accounting for 10p of every pound the @entity35 spends , what we are getting in return for that money is healthcare that is patchy and inconsistent			0
‘ from access to education when people are diagnosed right the way through to the care they receive in hospital , there are too many people getting a raw deal and this is fuelling high rates of diabetes - related complications and early death			0

the number of @entity3 adults with diabetes has hit 3.2 million
a further 850,000 are believed to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes
the rise is linked to @entity3 ' poor diets and being overweight
