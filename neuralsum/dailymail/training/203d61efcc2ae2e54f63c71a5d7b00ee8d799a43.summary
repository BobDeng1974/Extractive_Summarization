@entity1 posed as a cocaine dealer in an attempt to sting ' @entity5 reporter @entity4 , it has been claimed			1
the now - defunct sunday paper is said to have offered @entity8 writer @entity7 £ 5,000 to destroy the career of mr @entity1 , then editor of that magazine			1
but the whole scheme was a ruse dreamt up by mr @entity1 to tempt the paper with ' scandalous gossip ' and thus disprove its claim to only act in the public interest			1
he described how he and mr @entity32 , now mayor of @entity34 , came up with a series of ' implausible fables ' to tempt the @entity5 's reporters and expose how it deals with ' punters who approach it with bits and pieces of dirt '			2
mr @entity7 described how after calling the red - top with his claims that mr @entity1 was a high - class cocaine dealer , he was met in a pub by a reporter called @entity49 and asked to sign a contract offering him £ 5,000 for the story			1
mr @entity7 recounted : ' @entity49 wired me up and i phoned @entity1 , using my codename " @entity54 "			1
as an opener i mentioned some poems i ’d sent him ( in real life i ’m a poet )			0
did he want to publish them ? he sounded lukewarm , as we ’d agreed he should			0
' then i mentioned " @entity62 " and asked if he could give me a small package from " @entity61 "			0
" prince @entity61 , " she said , " must be real @entity65 talk ? " yeah , ’ i said			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , was preparing his end of the sting at the spectator 's offices			2
mr @entity7 wrote : ' he had a plastic bag of baking soda and was stuffing it underneath a statuette that graces the mantelpiece of his office			2
the inscription on the fine silver figurine reads : " to the spectator			0
from the townsfolk of @entity79			0
" the drugs would be produced with a flourish from beneath this official heirloom			2
' the fake sheikh : @entity85 reporter @entity4 was brought into the story , but before the double - cross was executed the paper realised they had already been offered another spurious story about mr @entity1 convinced it had taped evidence of @entity1 dealing @entity93 drugs , the @entity22 mobilised its troops			1
a blacked - out van full of photographers was sent to @entity8 and a video camera was hidden in the handbag of a @entity49 , who was posing as mr @entity7 ' girlfriend			1
they then dispatched mr @entity4 , their chief investigator , who now faces inquiries by @entity102 and the @entity103 , to meet him and double - check the story			0
but before mr @entity7 ' double - cross sting worked out , the paper realised he had earlier failed to provoke its reporters ' interests in a different spurious story about mr @entity1			1
' i was rumbled , ' wrote mr @entity7			1
when he finally came face to face with mr @entity4 , the reporter had a clear message for him			0
' " this is n’t the way we work , " he told me , ' mr @entity7 wrote			2
' " @entity1 is n’t a drug dealer — in the normal sense			2
he does n’t do it for a living ; he does n’t corrupt children			0
' ok , dealers like that , yeah , we go after them — but not in this case			0
and entrapment is not the way we work			0
" mr @entity1 published the story of how a @entity8 writer almost double - crossed the @entity22 in his magazine a few months later .			1

mr @entity1 *instructed* a @entity8 writer to go *undercover* as a ' source '
@entity85 offered @entity7 £ 5,000 to help catch mr @entity1 selling drugs
but the ruse was rumbled and the paper pulled out at the last minute
