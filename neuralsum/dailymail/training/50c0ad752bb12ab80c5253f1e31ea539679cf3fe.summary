but the advice may have come too late for some in other states in neighboring @entity113 , as eight - year - old @entity31 was selling her cookies outside the @entity115 in @entity36 on saturday			2
the girl 's mother , @entity116 , got the idea after hearing about what happened in @entity10			1

in ' high ' demand : miss @entity130 sold 117 cookie boxes in two hours standing outside @entity134 last week ' people will wait to buy when there are incentives , ' @entity157 said			1
she hopes the presence of the @entity4 will help eliminate the stigma tied to medical marijuana dispensaries , @entity157 said			2
