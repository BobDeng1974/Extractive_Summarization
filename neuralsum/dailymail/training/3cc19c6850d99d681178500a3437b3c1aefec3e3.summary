@entity0 asked @entity3 fans ' blog the @entity3 web to reveal the mood following the news the club might have to play at a neutral ground for a year before the new stadium is ready			1
@entity10 discusses what that means for the club			0
since @entity3 first announced plans in 2007/08 , progress to a replacement for @entity17 has been made at the speed of a @entity20 pirouette			1
ever since its inception it has appeared that every forward step with the @entity24 has been shortly followed by two backward ones			0
if all had gone to the original plan we ’d already have seen the team play in the completed ground – august 2014 was the target completion date			0
as it is , the only sign that the @entity32 in @entity33 does n’t stand for ‘ demolition ’ is the new @entity35 in @entity36 ( the thoroughfare , not the green space with slides and swings )			1
this is for two reasons			0
firstly , we suspected this scenario would be the case for a while now			0
secondly , it ’s a sign of progress			0
not as much of a sign as seeing @entity59 in a hard hat laying the foundation stone of the new ground , but it ’s proof there is a plan - even if that plan is n't being fully adhered to			0
@entity59 could face a season where @entity3 have to play home games at a neutral ground @entity3 will move from @entity17 in an effort to compete financially with the big @entity72 clubs rumours that the unlovable @entity74 in charge at @entity76 had refused @entity3 permission to use the freshly vacated @entity78 for a season was the first time i personally got wind that we might be looking to up sticks whilst the bulldozers moved in to @entity86			1
i wonder if we offered to try the @entity87 out for size for them for a season instead ? so , if it ’s not east @entity92 , where is it to be ? @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 have all been mentioned but @entity96 , home of the @entity97 has been a constant			1
@entity98 could consider moves to @entity95 , @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity96 a move there would set few pulses racing but the relative ease of transport from north @entity92 and a potential 32,000 capacity would tick a couple of @entity98 ’s big boxes			1
an option to play the bigger games at @entity95 might be a sop to those 3 - 4,000 who ’d get squeezed out by the capacity reduction			0
i wonder if we could get an agreement to play all of our evening games away from home to help avoid late night long distance travel for the home fans ? let ’s step into @entity123 ’s tango shoes for a moment			1
he ’ll hopefully have agreed a long - term plan with @entity98 ( nope , i ’ve not been sniffing anything ) which will , by the time we need to move , see us jousting with the best of @entity72 on a regular basis			2
perhaps he ’d like to host those clubs who ’ve limbo - ed under the @entity133 rules in front of a smaller in - your - face crowd rather than the atmosphere - free @entity95 ? it could all end up being to our advantage			2
you can follow the @entity3 web on @entity143 here .			2

@entity3 due to *relocate* to @entity36
the club is expected to leave @entity17 one season before moving to @entity36
most likely *temporary* home is @entity97 ' stadium
other possible options @entity154 , @entity101 and @entity100
season - long limbo might not be as bad as first *feared*
