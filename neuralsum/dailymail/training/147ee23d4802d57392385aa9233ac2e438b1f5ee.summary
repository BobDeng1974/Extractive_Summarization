by @entity0 criminals are abusing so - called ' right to be forgotten ' rules in a bid to cover up their past crimes , it emerged today			1
a @entity8 court ruling has ordered that search engine @entity10 remove links to webpages which people claim are no longer relevant			1
the move - which has seen the company inundated with nearly 100,000 requests to remove search results - has been widely criticised as unacceptable censorship of the internet			1
it has now emerged that criminals are exploiting the new rules by lying to @entity10 in a bid to cover up their past wrongdoing			1
it has emerged the criminals are abusing so - called ' right to be forgotten rules ' to hide their past wrongdoing the revelation came in a letter from @entity10 lawyer @entity30 to a working party set up by @entity32 to police data protection across @entity8			1
@entity10 is currently looking into requests by 91,000 people across @entity8 , who want 328,000 allegedly ' irrelevant or outdated ' web links removed from the web			1
but mr @entity30 revealed that because @entity10 only have people 's ' take - down requests ' to go by , they are only getting one side of the argument			2
in the letter , reported by @entity43 , he wrote : ' some requests turn out to have been made with false and inaccurate information			0
' even if requesters provide us with accurate information , they understandably may avoid presenting facts that are not in their favour			0
' he gives the example of criminals who apply to have links to news reports about their convictions removed , without mentioning they have since committed similar crimes			2
the new claims emerged in a letter sent by @entity10 lawyer @entity30 to a @entity32 group investigating the fallout of the @entity67 ruling news organisations , including @entity69 , have been notified of links to perfectly accurate reports which have been wiped from the internet after applications to @entity10			1
stories about a @entity76 referee who lied about a penalty incident , and an airline accused of racism by a @entity81 job applicant were among those censored			0
an article about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden , because someone was embarrassed about comments they had left at the bottom of the story			0
links to the referee story , which included no suggestion of any criminality , were later reinstated following public pressure			2
astonishingly , the @entity32 group monitoring the move has questioned whether news organisations and websites should be informed of the removals at all			0
but , in his letter , mr @entity30 informed them it was essential to ensure the system was not abused			0
he gave the example of unscrupulous businesses who may try and get links to their competitors ' websites removed so customers ca n't find them on the internet			2
the latest revelations came in the same week that a @entity114 said the new rules were ' unreasonable '			0
@entity116 , chair of the @entity118 @entity117 , said : ' we also do not believe that individuals should have a right to have links to accurate and lawfully available information about them removed , simply because they do not like what is said			0

new rules allow people to apply to @entity10 to have links wiped from web
move has been widely criticised as unacceptable censorship of the internet
it emerged today that criminals are trying to abuse system to hide their past
they lie to @entity10 to get search results about themselves taken down
