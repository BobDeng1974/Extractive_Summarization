the family of @entity10 listened in horror as they heard for the first time in court how @entity15 callously allowed his friend to die			1
@entity15 had got drunk and then driven at speeds of over 80mph with @entity10 in the passenger seat			1
he lost control and crashed , the car tumbling into a marsh			2
tragic : 22 - year - old @entity10 , pictured , died after his drunk friend @entity15 lost control of his car at speeds exceeding 80mph rescuers pulled screaming @entity15 from the sinking vehicle			1
but when asked if there was anyone else in the car , he calmly told police he was on his own			2
at @entity34 's @entity33 , @entity15 today admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being over the drink drive limit			1
he was remanded into custody until he is sentenced next month			2
as @entity15 faces jail , @entity10 ’s mum @entity39 revealed her agony and fury after learning how the killer motorist abandoned her son			1
she said : ' we were lost for words			2
you ca n’t describe how we felt at that moment			2
we feel anger and every other emotion you can imagine ' it was almost 12 months ago that 22 - year - old @entity10 , of @entity53 , @entity54 , had gone to @entity55 on holiday with two friends - including @entity15 , 21 , of @entity58			1
all three were staying at a caravan park in @entity60 and went to the bar on the evening of june 8			2
@entity10 had just received the good news that he had landed a dream job at the @entity65 factory in nearby @entity66			1
the boys bought five bottles of wine and drank four before taking the last back to the caravan			0
then @entity10 joined @entity15 in his @entity71 owned despite having no driving licence			1
@entity15 was speeding along the @entity73 to @entity74 road at over 80mph when he clipped the kerb on a tight bend near @entity78 in @entity79			1
careering out of control , the car hit a hazard marker post and trees before smashing into a telegraph pole and rolling down an embankment , eventually landing on its roof in a marsh			2
rescuers pulled @entity15 free and it was then he told them he was alone in the vehicle , even though @entity10 had been sat beside him , and was in a much worse condition having suffered a serious chest injury			1
@entity10 ’s parents @entity93 , 51 , and @entity39 , 42 , travelled to @entity34 for the case in the @entity33 and listened in horror as the grim details of their son ’s death emerged			1
@entity39 said : ' i got so choked up			0
we only found out in court			2
it ’s just beyond belief			0
rescuers saved @entity15 , pictured outside court , from his sinking vehicle , he then told them he was alone in the car even though @entity10 had been sat beside him ' we could n’t do anything			1
we were in court and were n’t allowed to say anything			2
we knew he had n’t shown any remorse or tried to make any contact with @entity93 and me , or send us anything , but what kind of a friend is that ? ' he was supposed to be @entity10 ’s friend - he was n’t one we knew or had met but we thought they were friends			1
so how could he have said that he was the only one in the car ? we do n’t understand it			2
' we actually felt quite sorry for him for a while - that ’s the worst part			0
we also wonder what might have happened if rescuers had got to @entity10 earlier			1
' i think the damage was too great , so i do n’t think he could have survived , but it ’s something we ’ll question			0
' the court heard how the first witnesses on the scene heard @entity15 screaming and shouting he was drowning , so one man contacted the emergency services and another made his way down the embankment			1
when the emergency services arrived at the scene they believed there was only one person in the vehicle			1
advocate depute @entity142 told the court : ' police officers saw a bare arm submerged in water which they believed to be the accused ’s arm			2
the accused was struggling to keep his head above water			0
' a paramedic smashed the driver ’s window with a torch and cut the seatbelt to free @entity15 from the wreckage			1
it was only once he had been released that rescuers realised there was someone else in the car as they could still see an arm of the person who was submerged			2
when they finally pulled @entity10 free he had no pulse and he died as a result of the chest injury			1
the court head that @entity15 has previous convictions for drink driving , driving without a licence and insurance and taking a vehicle without consent that stretch back to a juvenile court appearance in 2004			1
@entity39 said : ' obviously it ’s given us peace of mind knowing he ’s been remanded - i do n’t know what i would have done if they ’d bailed him			0
' now we ’ve just got to wait to see what he gets			0
hopefully we will get some justice			0
' it ’s a slight relief for us that he ’s admitted it , and now we can try to get our life back			0
but his death has affected every part of both of us			2
' you ca n’t imagine what it ’s like			0
we ’re taking each day at a time but we ca n’t enjoy ourselves			0
it ’s all too raw			0
' the pain of dealing with her grief became all too much and the distraught mum , 42 , attempted to take her own life just three months ago			0
both she and @entity93 have been unable to work since their son ’s death			1
@entity39 was forced to give up her job as a senior carer , and she does n’t know when she will be able to return			0
she said : ' i went back to work but i could n’t cope , ' she said			0
' i took an overdose and was in intensive care for three days			0
i ’m not proud of it but it ’s all part and parcel of life			0
' but i ’m still here and i ’m pleased i ’m here			0
it all got too much			0
' i ’m aware of what i ’ve put my family through but i just do n’t want to care about anybody - i do n’t want to care for people			0
i just think why has all this happened ? ' @entity10 ’s close friend @entity220 , 22 , of @entity221 , condemned @entity15 ’s actions as ' disgraceful '			1
the @entity224 bakery operative said : ' he ’s got to live with this for the rest of his life			0
no one will trust him			0
no one wants to be his friend , it ’s disgraceful			0
' he must have known that @entity10 was in a worse condition than him but he just thought about himself and got the people to help him first			1
' @entity10 was the innocent person in all of this and he never did a bad thing			1
' he was my best friend and not a day goes by when i do n’t think about him			0

@entity10 's parents will never know if their son might have lived if he *'d* been pulled from the car sooner
they listened in court in utter shock when they learned @entity15 lied to emergency services about @entity10 being in the car as it sank
