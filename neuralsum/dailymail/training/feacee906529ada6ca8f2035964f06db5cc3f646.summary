‘ we thought we had a happy ending			2
lights and gates are going up in the next two weeks — they ’ve already been delivered			2
i think everyone thought it was a good ending to a tragic story			0
this is just really a shock to everyone , ’ @entity24 told the @entity25			0
dead : @entity18 , 22 , died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train , now the railroad is suing his mother for damages despite @entity24 , 50 , persuading the rail operator to budget over $ 400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings , the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates , yet the @entity14 felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate , according to @entity53 is ‘ wholly responsible ’ for costs related to rail repair and a ‘ bottleneck of rail traffic , ’ according to a copy of the suit obtained by the @entity25			1
the suit goes on to say that @entity18 failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling ‘ at an excessive rate of speed ’ over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train , the paper reported			1
@entity18 died six days later at a local hospital			0
‘ he created a situation of danger			0
( and ) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing , ’ the paper reported the suit said.of the 116 passengers on - board the @entity72 train , six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision , according to a report from the @entity78			1
pay up : @entity14 says negligence caused the collision and that the $ 500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother @entity24 unsafe : the suit was brought against @entity24 despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded the history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which @entity18 had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a @entity97 train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred , according to the @entity78 report			1
adequate signage and warnings were installed at the @entity97 crossing shortly after the incident , the tsb report noted.despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where @entity18 ’s pickup truck was hit , @entity14 neglected to upgrade the crossing ’s warning systems , which the @entity78 said were ‘ situated too low , ’ to sufficiently warn @entity112 a hindrance to @entity18 being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn ’s position – instead of being at the front of the locomotive , it was in the middle of the head car , making it harder to hear , according to the @entity78 report			1
crushed : @entity24 's son is dead because a train hit him , and now the railway wants her to pony up $ 400,000 the devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad , saying it was never about the money			2
‘ we were happy with getting some safety measures in place			0
we never were seeking anything financial , ’ she told @entity129 , adding ‘ i was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that wo n’t be happening too soon			0
’ both the railway and @entity24 are declining to comment publicly on the suit , with @entity24 only telling @entity141 ‘ i do n’t want to be doing this at this time.i just want to have a peaceful time			0

the lawsuit seeks damages related to the deceased man 's negligence
this was not the first death at this rail crossing
