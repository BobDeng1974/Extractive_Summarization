by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:24 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 18:32 est , 6 december 2012 ministers must find £ 27billion of fresh spending cuts or tax rises to plug the black hole in the nation ’s finances , @entity3 ’s leading economic think - tank revealed yesterday			1
the @entity10 said @entity3 is on course for £ 7billion of tax rises and another £ 20billion in welfare cuts and spending reductions after the next election			1
@entity10 director @entity16 also predicted that pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and television licences , and the winter fuel allowance – which @entity21 has pledged to protect until 2015 – are almost certain to be slashed after the election			1
@entity25 chancellor @entity22 and @entity24 treasury minister @entity23 will have to set out spending cuts and tax rises until 2018 at the next election the cuts are needed because the chancellor has pledged to get the national debt as a share of national income falling by 2017 in order to convince the markets that @entity3 ’s recovery plan is on track			1
leading ratings agency @entity36 has already threatened to strip the @entity3 of its coveted @entity38 status in the wake of the @entity40			0
it said @entity22 ’s admission that he will miss a crucial target to cut the country ’s debt burden by 2015 - 16 ‘ weakens the credibility ’ of the public finances			1
but getting debt back on track by 2017 will be painful , the @entity10 warned			2
if the next government continues to protect spending on the @entity51 , schools and aid , it will have to make real - terms cuts totalling 16 per cent in 2017 in the other departments			1
that would take cuts in those departments to 31 per cent since the downturn began			0
mr @entity16 said no government would dare do this , making further tax rises and welfare cuts ‘ almost inevitable ’			2
plans already announced by mr @entity22 mean cuts account for 85 per cent of debt reductions in 2017 , with just 15 per cent from tax rises			1
up to 2015 , the chancellor has pledged to achieve an 80 - 20 split between tax rises and spending cuts			1
if he were to achieve the same balance in 2017 , it would mean tax rises of £ 7billion , with the rest of the £ 27billion saved from cuts to defence , councils , transport and other departments			1
so far just £ 4.5billion of the £ 10billion of welfare cuts the chancellor has said will be necessary have been announced , suggesting the @entity81 will seek to make at least another £ 5.5billion of benefits savings after the election			2
but mr @entity16 said money for the @entity51 and pensioners accounts for 40 per cent of public spending , and ministers will have to take from both if they are to balance the books			0
mr @entity22 insisted yesterday that @entity3 remained a safe bet for international investors despite fears over the credit rating			2
a downgrade – which could drive up borrowing costs for the government , businesses and households – would be a crushing humiliation for the chancellor but economists warned that it was only a matter of time before @entity3 was stripped of its aaa rating			0
@entity103 spokesman @entity102 said : ‘ the reason why there is a big hole in @entity22 ’s plan is that his reckless policies choked off the recovery and have pushed up long - term unemployment			2
’ debt mountain : the @entity3 's public sector net debt is set to get worse than previously thought tax - free office perks such as subsidised food in the staff canteen could be axed under a @entity103 review of workplace expenses			0
other areas under threat include @entity122 gifts from managers and a right for staff to take home products made by their employers at a reduced price			0
chancellor @entity22 has asked officials to look at the complex area of workplace expenses to see if more tax should be paid			1
documents released alongside the @entity40 show that the independent @entity134 ( @entity134 ) will look at office benefits			0
this could also include cheap petrol and £ 30,000 tax - free redundancy payments			0
the @entity103 said : ‘ the government will ask the @entity134 to carry out a review of ways to simplify the taxation of employee benefits and expenses and employee termination payments			0
’ it did not give further details but accountants said one proposal could be for @entity149 to bring in a flat rate allowance per employee for expenses incurred off - site .			0

@entity10 reveals extent of spending reductions needed to meet @entity22 's *deficit* targets
if *spread* across @entity159 *unprotected* areas like defence and transport would face cuts of 16 **%**
report also warns *poorest* *hardest* hit by 1 **%** benefits *cap* for three years
by 2015 up to *5million* *people* will have been *dragged* into *40p* tax rate
