today 's storm was predicted to be the worst since the @entity1 , which battered @entity2 and @entity3 leaving 18 people dead and causing £ 1.5billion worth of damage to the economy			1
in the early hours of october 16 winds peaked at more than 120mph , damaging buildings and felling 15million trees in the south east of @entity2			1
millions of homes were left without power for at least a few hours , with some having no electricity for days as trees fell on power lines , disrupting supplies			1
the highest gust recorded from the storm was at @entity23 , @entity24 , hitting 122mph			0
a ship capsized at @entity30 , and a @entity32 ferry was driven ashore near @entity33			0
veteran weatherman @entity34 bore the brunt for famously telling the nation there was no hurricane in the offing , just hours before it arrived			2
at the time mr @entity34 told viewers tuning into the broadcast : ‘ earlier on today , apparently , a woman rang the @entity43 and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way ; well , if you ’re watching , do n’t worry , there is n’t , but having said that , actually , the weather will become very windy , but most of the strong winds , incidentally , will be down over @entity52 and across into @entity53			1
’ business as usual : a routemaster driving through the streets of @entity19 after the strong winds power : a sealink ferry was forced onto dry land by the extreme winds @entity61 is set to be hit by the worst weather since the @entity1 when this tree crashed over in @entity64 , @entity65 but in 2011 , one of his former colleagues finally stepped forward to take the blame for the @entity71 ’s botched forecast			1
@entity72 , who was chief forecaster at the time , admitted that he was in fact responsible for the lunchtime broadcast on october 15 in 1987			0
it was the worst storm since 1703 and a public enquiry was announced shortly after the storm and an internal enquiry was conducted by the @entity71			2
the official forecaster wrote : ' we now know that the strength of the storm was boosted by a phenomenon known as the ‘ @entity84 ’ , where cold dry air descends into storms high in the atmosphere			0
' rain or snow falling into this jet of air evaporates and cools the air further , adding more energy which translates into stronger winds			0
by the time this ‘ sting in the tail ’ reaches the ground it can produce winds of 100mph which are concentrated over a small area			1
' in 1987 , no - one knew sting jets even existed , but now they are well understood and included in forecast models			0
the storm which affected @entity104 in december 2011 was boosted by a sting jet , explaining the maximum gust speed of 164mph recorded on top of @entity108			2

winds of up to 120mph hit @entity2 and @entity3 in the early hours of october 16 , 1987 and killed 18 people
millions of trees were *destroyed* and homes left without electricity when power lines were downed
storm was caused by a ' sting jet ' which concentrated strong winds in a relatively small area
@entity34 famously told the public that *reports* of a ' hurricane ' were *incorrect* during the @entity43 weather forecast
@entity128 which hit @entity61 this *morning* was predicted to be the worst since the @entity1
