by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 23 january 2013 it is nearly four decades since the @entity3 people were last given the chance to have their say on @entity6 , in the first ever referendum held throughout the @entity3			1
and now that @entity11 has promised an in - out referendum on the @entity13 by 2017 , the parallels between the first @entity10 vote and the one potentially looming are striking			2
in the mid 1970s , @entity3 was slipping behind its @entity10 neighbours , as the government struggled to deal with runaway inflation and was forced to introduce a three - day working week due to severe electricity shortages			0
battle : during the 1975 referendum on @entity6 , prime minister @entity20 , left , had to face down a rebellion from other members of the @entity23 such as @entity24 , right europhile conservative prime minister @entity25 firmly believed that the way to rescue the @entity3 from its economic slump was to join the @entity28			1
the decision to sign up in 1973 came after 300 hours of bruising debate in @entity31 , and in the end passed by just eight votes			0
@entity34 came to power the following year with a manifesto which promised to offer a referendum on whether or not to stay in the @entity28			2
the position of the new prime minister , @entity20 , was similar to that set out by mr @entity11 today - he pledged to renegotiate the terms of @entity3 's membership , then campaign for an ' in ' vote in the referendum			1
however , in a contrast to the current situation , most of the @entity47 opposition at that time came not from the @entity51 but from the @entity52 , led by firebrand mp @entity24			2
the referendum was officially called in april 1975 , with the date set for june 5 that year - despite many mps arguing that a public vote would violate the principle of parliamentary sovereignty			1
support : conservative leader @entity61 , pictured casting her vote , campaigned to stay in the @entity28 @entity63 : liberal @entity64 , @entity65 @entity25 and @entity34 's @entity66 ( pictured left to right ) teamed up to make the case for @entity3 maintaining close ties to @entity6 despite the brief campaigning period of just two months , the argument was fierce and divisive - but this time , it was @entity34 rather than the conservatives which was torn apart by disagreements on @entity6			1
the party chose to remain officially neutral , due to the split between the @entity77 leadership and the overwhelmingly @entity47 membership			0
unusually , members of the @entity23 were allowed to campaign against each other , with left - wing ministers facing off against their more moderate colleagues			0
as well as @entity24 , future @entity34 leader @entity83 and pioneering veteran @entity84 found themselves ranged against the likes of home secretary @entity66 and @entity87 , who became prime minister on @entity20 's resignation the next year			1
@entity61 , recently elected leader of the @entity90 , argued for staying in the @entity28 , as did most of her party as well as the @entity92			0
opposition : @entity34 leader @entity83 , pictured with his wife @entity95 , helped lead the ' no ' campaign count : volunteers tallying ballot papers in @entity100 after the referendum on june 5 , 1975 @entity102 : 68.7 % for , 31.3 % against @entity103 : 58.4 % for , 41.6 % against @entity104 : 64.8 % for , 35.1 % against @entity105 : 52.1 % for , 47.9 % against total : 67.2 % ( 17,378,581 ) for , 32.8 % ( 8,470,073 ) against ; turnout 64.5 % the ' yes ' campaign was supported and funded by big business , anxious to secure access to the @entity28 which covered all of @entity6 , and to share in the economic boom enjoyed by the likes of @entity113 and @entity114			1
it was strongly opposed by the trade unions , who warned that @entity3 jobs would be lost if labour markets were opened up , and urged the @entity3 to seek alternative trading partners outside @entity6			0
the arguments deployed by both sides were largely to do with the economic effects of close links with @entity6 - few would have predicted that the @entity28 would grow into today 's @entity13 , with wide - ranging powers to make laws for member states			1
the question on the ballot paper on june 5 read : ' do you think the @entity3 should stay in the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) ? ' the eventual result was a landslide for the ' yes ' campaign , with 67.2 per cent of the public voting to stay in the @entity28			1
every single council area saw a majority in support of the @entity28 , with the exception of @entity139 and the @entity140			0
parallel : @entity11 now finds himself in a similar position to @entity20 's after pledging an @entity13 referendum the @entity3 therefore remained in the @entity28 , which had its origins in the @entity145 in 1951 establishing the @entity146 involving @entity114 , @entity113 , @entity147 , the @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			1
by the 1970s , when @entity3 joined alongside @entity151 and @entity105 , the group had expanded to include a customs union and common policies on agriculture and trade , but did not impose regulations within member countries			0
the @entity28 was replaced by the @entity13 as a result of the @entity160 , which came into force in 1993 after sparking the first signs of @entity163 in @entity3 , with a huge backbench revolt against @entity166 's attempt to ratify the agreement			0
the @entity13 has now swollen to 27 countries , with @entity169 and @entity170 the most recent new additions , and has wide - ranging powers to set laws which must be obeyed by all its members			0
in the aftermath of the 1975 result , many observers ascribed the overwhelming result to the deep pockets of the ' yes ' campaign and its successful attempts to demonise @entity47 as either left - wing extremists , such as @entity24 and @entity185 , or xenophobes , such as @entity187			2
in the forthcoming @entity13 referendum , the ' yes ' campaign , which will be supported by the leaders of all three parties , is likely to take a similar approach by painting those wishing to leave the @entity13 as dogmatic isolationists			0
recent polls have shown the @entity3 closely divided over @entity6 - a @entity197 survey released this week suggested that 40 per cent would vote to stay in the @entity3 while 34 per cent wanted to leave , but a poll in november showed more than half of people wanted to quit the @entity13 .			2

poll on june 5 , 1975 was the first referendum ever held in the @entity3
over 67 % of @entity3 voted to stay in the @entity28
opposition to @entity6 was led by @entity34 left - wingers such as @entity24 rebelling against prime minister @entity20
