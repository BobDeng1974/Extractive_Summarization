by @entity0 last updated at 8:28 pm on 30th december 2011 a physicist at @entity3 's @entity2 has recreated one of the two main particle detectors at the @entity6 out of @entity7 - and the replica machine is to scale with the tiny @entity7 engineers that walk through its tunnels			1
@entity11 used 9,500 pieces of @entity7 to build the model - a task which took him 35 hours.the @entity2 covered his 2,000 @entity15 bill - hoping that @entity18 's work would inspire interest in high - energy physics			2
the scale model , built by @entity18 using 9,500 @entity7 pieces , is of of the @entity24 particle detector at the @entity6 - one of two particle detectors used in the hunt for the @entity27 the model took 35 hours to build - and cost 2,000 euros			1
@entity18 enlisted help with sorting the bricks for his particle detector , but built it entirely himself the @entity7 version of the @entity6 is almost exactly to scale with @entity7 men - and includes models of the @entity24 detectors magnets and detectors @entity18 has contacted @entity7 to see if the @entity3 company is interested in making the model part of its official range			1
planning a 3d model took him 48 solid hours of work - before he even began sorting the bricks			0
' it illustrates all details , from the muon spectrometer and magnet system to the innermost pixel detector , ' says @entity18			0
' i do not have a straightforward construction manual yet , but i am working on it ! ' the real @entity24 detector - one of two detectors that sit on the ' ring ' at the @entity6 to monitor particles created in the high - speed collision - is about 70 feet wide and weighs 7,000 tonnes @entity18 recruited his wife to help with sorting the 9,500 bricks for the model , but built the mini @entity6 himself ' it illustrates all details , from the muon spectrometer and magnet system to the innermost pixel detector , ' says @entity18 the real @entity24 detector - one of two detectors that sit on the ' ring ' at the @entity6 to monitor particles created in the high - speed collision - is about 70 feet wide and weighs 7,000 tonnes			2
