by @entity0 the @entity2 administration believes there is a new leaker of compromising national security secrets who could potentially compound the embarrassment caused by @entity10 contractor @entity8			1
the federal government has come to this conclusion after a new story was published on tuesday morning by @entity14 , the site launched by @entity16 , the journalist who first brought the @entity8 leaks to public attention			1
according to @entity20 , the proof lies in documents obtained for the article about @entity24 government surveillance of suspected terrorists which is dated from august 2013 - months after @entity8 escaped first to @entity27 and then to @entity28 to escape spying charges			1
stunning leaks : journalist @entity16 ( left ) has fanned the flames that he is working with a new source in addition to @entity8 ( right ) who infamously fed information on @entity10 spying to @entity16 and @entity36 last year indeed , @entity37 - based @entity16 , who left the @entity36 last year to launch the intercept with the backing of @entity41 founder , billionaire , @entity40 , has fanned the flames by suggesting there is indeed another leaker			2
the nightmare news for the @entity2 administration comes as a report in @entity14 highlights the one million names collected on the database called the @entity49 ( @entity49 )			0
it claims that as part of this data , there is one watchlist called the @entity55 which contains 680,000 names , of which only a fraction are @entity24			2
however , it also claims that 40 percent of those on the list have no affiliation at all to terrorist groups			0
in addition , the list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber plot to destroy a @entity67 - bound airliner on christmas day in 2009			0
concern : president @entity2 and his administration have become convinced there is a second source according to @entity20 @entity49 : the documents printe in the intercept date from august 2013 - months after @entity8 fled the @entity24 the justification for this is that the would - be bomber , @entity76 was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack			1
a spokesperson for the @entity82 declined any comment on the @entity20 report on tuesday			0
in addition to @entity14 's report , two recent article in the @entity87 press have reported on @entity24 national security and spying issues without citing @entity8 - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak			2
' that 's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using @entity8 documents - including der @entity98 - specifically identified him as the source , ' @entity16 said in an email to @entity101 last month .			0

federal government convinced new leaker is supplying secrets to journalists
new report on @entity110 terrorist watchlist is based on data obtained in august 2013
this is two months after @entity8 fled the @entity24 for *asylum* in @entity28
