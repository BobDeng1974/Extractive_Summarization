when scuba diver @entity1 zipped up his wetsuit and secured his mask for a dive off the coast of @entity6 , he was perhaps hoping to see crabs scuttling on the sea bed			1
what the 6ft 3in teenager did not expect was to find himself overshadowed by a vast , white , barrel jellyfish with a violet fringe and lace - like trailing tendrils			1
@entity1 ’s father , @entity14 , who took this photo of his son with the giant near @entity18 , @entity19 , said they had seen an unprecedented number of jellyfish this summer			1
’ it ’s not the first time this year that barrel jellyfish have made the headlines			1
in may , wildlife photographer @entity32 found a rubbery mound on a gravel beach in @entity35 , @entity36 , while out for a walk			0
it became clear that the glistening , gelatinous mass , which measured about 20in across , was an extremely large barrel jellyfish or @entity42 , one of the largest species to be found in @entity46 waters			1
also known as ‘ dustbin - lid jellyfish ’ due to their size , the creatures can reach up to 35in in diameter and weigh up to 6st			1
rarely do they stray close to land			0
however , mr @entity32 says he has now counted five of the bizarre creatures — which are distinguished by their large size and thick , rubbery skin — on @entity35 ’s beaches			0
so what has caused this astonishing rise in the number of barrel jellyfish in @entity46 waters ? and have we anything to fear from this eerie , underwater invasion ? wildlife experts believe they have been brought close to shore by a combination of strong winds and rising sea temperatures			1
when the creatures appear in very large numbers it is known as a ‘ jellyfish bloom ’			1
this occurs when strong ocean currents force large numbers of them into swarms , carrying them in the same direction			1
these ‘ blooms ’ can include hundreds , or even thousands , of jellyfish			1
barrel jellyfish , sometimes known as bin - lid jellyfish because of their size , can measure up to 35 inches in diameter and weigh up to six stone because they do n’t have a central nervous system , jellyfish have limited control over their movements , meaning they are carried from place to place — and even stranded on beaches — by the movement of the currents			1
scientists believe blooms like the one off the @entity6 coast are becoming much more common			1
though there are few records of past jellyfish populations , recent surveys suggest their numbers are increasing dramatically			1
one theory to explain this is that over-fishing has reduced the number of sea creatures , such as sardines and anchovies , competing for the same foods , mostly plankton			0
it has also meant there are fewer fish such as herring in the ocean , which feed on jellyfish eggs before they mature			1
so tenacious are jellyfish that some experts warn of an apocalyptic future when they will dominate the seas completely			1
within 40 or 50 years , @entity46 marine biologist professor @entity125 has theorised , other species will have died out and the oceans will be home only to slimy algae and jellyfish			1
certainly , there seem to be a lot of them around @entity46 ’s coastline			1
@entity134 , 48 , stumbled upon a three - foot barrel jellyfish when she was walking her dog on a beach in @entity36 in may			1
earlier that month , more than 50 barrel jellyfish washed up on a beach in @entity140 , @entity6 and a further 12 were glimpsed in @entity141 , @entity36			1
in december , it was claimed that jellyfish sightings in @entity144 had reached their highest level in 25 years			1
and while the barrel jellyfish is harmless to humans , the same ca n’t be said of every specimen in @entity46 waters			1
last august , several red and orange ‘ @entity151 ’ jellyfish were spotted off the west coast of @entity154			1
with tentacles more than 100ft long , they are sea monsters			0
the largest on record , spotted in 1870 , had 120ft tentacles and a diameter of 7ft			1
their sting can cause severe blisters and muscle cramp and can be deadly to those with heart problems			0
this time last year , swimmers were warned to keep their wits about them after several @entity171 man o ’ @entity173 jellyfish were sighted in @entity6			1
they deliver a severe sting by affixing their tentacles to human skin			0
even after the sting has been pulled from the flesh , still more venom can be released if the skin is rubbed , causing large red welts , nausea , convulsions — or even , in rare instances , death			0
in 2012 , @entity186 , a 58 - year - old grandfather , died after suffering severe anaphylactic shock when he was stung by a @entity188 near @entity189			0
in the @entity191 , up to 40 people die each year from jellyfish stings			2
among the most venomous are the @entity194 - dwelling box jellyfish , which have 24 eyes and grow to 10ft			2
several @entity197 jellyfish were spotted in waters @entity6 last year			1
their tentacles can affix to human skin , delivering a severe sting which become worse if rubbed the minuscule @entity203 , on the other hand , rarely grow to a width of more than 25mm , but can still cause almost instant death by anaphylaxis — a severe constriction of the airways			0
given their deadly powers , it ’s little wonder that jellyfish inspire such fear and fascination			2
and few creatures boast such a colourful history			0
they have been drifting around the oceans , largely untouched by evolution , for at least 500 million years			0
their name , which came into use in the 18th century , is deceptive			0
jellyfish are n’t real ‘ fish ’			2
they have no vertebrae and no specialised digestive , respiratory or central nervous system			0
instead , they absorb oxygen though their extremely thin skin			0
nutrients are taken in through a stalk - like tube hanging down from the underside of their body , which has a mouth at its tip. typically , they feed on plankton , crustaceans and fish eggs — though some species , such as the @entity151 , are cannibals , feasting on other jellyfish			2
‘ they are really quite remarkable , ’ says dr @entity247 , director of the @entity249 ’s biodiversity programme			0
‘ they are such a simple creature — but that ’s one reason they are so successful			0
’ ‘ and , unlike other creatures , jellyfish do quite well in water where oxygen levels are low , so they thrive even in severe pollution			2
’ while other sea animals have faded into extinction , jellyfish have thrived , and there are more than 3,000 species , range in size from 1mm to just under 7ft in diameter			2
but what does the current influx mean for beach - goers ? in @entity272 , swarms have closed entire resorts , ruining holidays for thousands and putting local firms out of business			0
a horde even forced the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in @entity281 last year after they clogged the cooling system , while fishing boats in @entity285 have been capsized by refrigerator - sized jellyfish caught in nets			2
if the jellyfish boom continues , coastal areas may find themselves forced to take extreme measures to repel gelatinous visitors			2
with this fear in mind , scientists in @entity293 have developed so - called ‘ jellyfish terminator ’ robots that can patrol the coastline			2
irukandji jellyfish rarely grow larger than 25mm across , but can still kill thanks to anaphylaxis the machines float along the surface of water and use on - board cameras to detect jellyfish			2
they then suck them up in nets and shred them into pieces			0
thankfully , dr @entity247 says there ’s no need for such a drastic response yet along the coasts of @entity46			1
but , despite the barrel jelly ’s harmless nature , he recommends keeping your distance if you see one			2
unless you are very sure of its identification , it could be a more harmful species			0
for those who do get stung by a jellyfish , treatments vary according to the nature of the sting and which type of jellyfish is responsible			2
‘ the most important thing to remember is that when you are stung , ’ says dr @entity247 , ‘ the jellyfish usually leaves its tentacle on you , so you should wash the wound and add ice			0
’ taking antihistamines , scraping the skin with a ( not - too - sharp ) knife edge and applying iced water to the injured area are just three methods used to soothe injuries			0
there ’s no ‘ miracle cure ’ for a jellyfish sting			0
urinating on the wound does not help — although it is widely believed that it does			0
but if you are stung by a box jellyfish overseas — or even a @entity354 ’s @entity354 here in @entity46 — you must seek medical attention			1
while the jellyfish bloom might be bad news for swimmers , there are some people who are celebrating			0
‘ from a natural history point of view , it ’s exciting , ’ says photographer @entity32			0
‘ we should embrace the chance to get to look at them			0
’ @entity367 , but you first , @entity32			0

barrel jellyfish spotted this week by diver off the coast of @entity6
@entity374 is latest sighting of giant jellyfish of the shores of @entity46
experts believe warming seas and strong winds are to blame for rise
