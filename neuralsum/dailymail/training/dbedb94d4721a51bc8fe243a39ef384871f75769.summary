by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 6 april 2013 @entity2 's chief whip was last night at the centre of allegations that he has used ‘ leaked ’ @entity5 ’ expenses to ‘ bully ’ enemies of the prime minister			0
the claims have been made by @entity11 rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against mr @entity2 ’s policies on @entity17 and gay marriage			2
they accuse sir @entity20 – who is charged with imposing discipline on the increasingly fractious parliamentary party – of ‘ victimising ’ them by using confidential details of their travel and housing claims			1
controversy : sir @entity20 , left , is at the centre of allegations he has used ' leaked ' @entity5 ' expenses to ' bully ' enemies of the prime minister , right now one rebel mp has made a formal complaint to the government ’s official watchdog , the information commissioner			1
he has accused the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) – the body that monitors mps ’ pay and perks – of breaching the @entity43 by passing information to sir @entity20			1
the mp , who has defied the whips to call for a cut in the @entity50 budget and vote against gay marriage but asked not to be identified , told @entity52 : ‘ sir @entity20 warned me that i should play ball with @entity38 , or risk personal financial details being made public			1
i feel that amounted to blackmail			0
‘ i wrote to sir @entity56 , the chairman of @entity38 , to complain , and received a letter back which told me that , “ mps should not be surprised that @entity38 has dealings with @entity59 ”			2
allegations : the claims have been made by @entity11 rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against mr @entity66 s policies on @entity17 and gay marriage ‘ that is why i have complained to the commissioner			2
@entity38 should not be passing information to third parties			2
’ relations between @entity5 and @entity38 have become increasingly acrimonious since it introduced a rule that requires them to hand back a share of the profit on the rising value of taxpayer - funded second homes			0
it has left some mps facing demands for more than £ 50,000			0
the row has broken out amid claims that sir @entity20 has found out which rebels owe money to @entity38 and then used the information to ‘ intimidate ’ them – an allegation that is strongly denied			1
another mp claimed he was told by sir @entity20 that he should settle a disputed expenses claim if ‘ he wanted to be an mp at the next election ’			1
a third mp said : ‘ sir @entity20 is trying to find a new way to victimise and bully the rebels , threatening to take their whip away or “ tell the boss ” if they do n’t cough up to @entity38			1
’ a source close to sir @entity20 said : ‘ it is complete paranoid nonsense to suggest that the chief whip has in any way used @entity5 ’ expenses difficulties as a way of enforcing discipline			1
it ’s just not his style			0
‘ it is perfectly normal for the chief whip to discuss an mp ’s expenses with them if there is an issue			0
‘ the information about the expenses of the mp who has complained was not confidential			2
’ last night , an @entity38 spokesman said it was ‘ perfectly reasonable ’ for the body to ‘ raise concerns ’ about mps with chief whips			0
‘ where mps claimed for a subsidy from the taxpayer for their mortgage , we ask for the taxpayer ’s share of any increase in the value of the property , ’ he said			0
‘ if an mp refused to comply with that rule , we would challenge that , and it is reasonable that we raise our concerns			0
