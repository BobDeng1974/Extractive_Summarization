click here to read @entity2 's match report of @entity4 's impressive victory at the @entity5			1
at some point in the near future we will have to ask whether honesty is the preserve of the @entity11 game or whether we are done with beating the integrity drum			0
the 24th minute at the @entity5 , when @entity13 brushed against @entity14 to prompt a slow - motion collapse inside the penalty area , seems a good place to start			1
@entity4 ’s left back looked like a sky diver , using the friction of @entity14 ’s body to launch himself into the night air and executing a safe landing with some cushioned rolls			2
it was tempting to applaud the audacity			0
@entity13 ( right ) seemed to go down easily under @entity14 's challenge to win the penalty @entity27 captain @entity14 stood his ground and @entity13 appeared to fall easily over his leg @entity13 goes up into the air as @entity14 tries to pull his body backwards and goes down in the box so did @entity13 dive ? the answer is that we will never really know for sure , but even @entity36 admitted that this one went their way			1
if the defender did , can you blame him ? based on everything else that goes on each week at every other stadium , then probably not			0
@entity45 , bless him , bought it because at speed and without the benefit of an assistant referee or a fourth official with enough gumption to give him some guidance , he will be at ease with himself			0
‘ i ’ve always said that referees need help and guidance in these situations because they have to make an instant decision , ’ admitted @entity4 ’s manager			2
@entity36 was pretty gracious about it , accepting that the decision to award a penalty , converted by @entity63 , turned in @entity4 ’s favour on this occasion			1
‘ the movement of @entity70 allows him to dive , ’ claimed @entity27 ’s manager			2
‘ i am not saying it was a bad mistake of the referee , but the penalty changed the game and was not the reason we lost			2
’ he is spot on , there			0
@entity4 played at a different tempo to @entity27 and deserved to win here			1
for those who worry about the games that go on out there between players in the heat of battle , then the incident between @entity13 and @entity27 ’s captain is perfect fodder			1
the stakes were unusually high , amplified by the fact that @entity4 ’s immediate rivals for a place in the @entity96 - @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity98 - all won on saturday			2
the @entity4 defender appears to fall over quite dramatically as @entity14 throws his hands into the air @entity63 ( left ) puts a right footed penalty past the diving @entity104 to give @entity4 the lead from the spot @entity36 ’s team were under pressure , particularly as anyone outside @entity110 expected this lot to be swatted aside at the home of the champions			1
there were demands on @entity27 too and there was an anticipation that they would match @entity120 ’s performance at the @entity121 , where they beat @entity123 5 - 0 , with a convincing win			1
take nothing away from @entity4 ’s work - rate and application because @entity36 ’s team , with the excellent @entity128 spearheading their attack , did a number on @entity27			1
they did a proper job on them			0
@entity128 deserved his goal , flinging himself at @entity63 ’s free - kick in the 67th minute free - kick to increase @entity4 ’s advantage			1
this is a very good win			0
beyond that is the bigger picture , the bone of contention that leaves a tv audience all over the world wondering whether @entity45 has been had over by some clever improvisation			0
the incident was not the classic trip , the outstretched leg or the clattering challenge that forces a referee to make a decision based on the aggression or the severity of the injury			0
@entity63 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity4 team - mates @entity128 ( left ) and @entity159 these are the issues @entity161 address in his brilliant autobiography @entity163 and @entity164 , where he admits that he would exaggerate the impact to draw attention to a foul			1
the @entity168 was forced to change his ways , under pressure from a dressing room that included the likes of @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
they just did things a certain way back then			0
@entity13 ’s fall was much cuter , a subtle form of the game that has crept in to @entity11 football over the past few seasons			2
they are all at it these days and it was only last week that @entity120 ’s assistant manager @entity188 hinted that @entity189 had been forced to master the craft of winning free - kicks in opposition territory			0
what a sad indictment of the modern game , a tacit acceptance that the players are calling the tune these days			0
putting that to one side , @entity4 ’s win was as clean as they come			2
the @entity4 midfielder coolly dispatches the penalty to put the @entity204 ahead at the @entity5 @entity27 captain @entity14 ( right ) protests to referee @entity45 ( centre ) after the awarding of the penalty @entity128 ( second right ) makes it 2 - 0 to @entity4 by heading a free - kick past @entity104 ( left ) in the @entity27 goal @entity4 striker @entity128 ( right ) runs off with his finger pointing in the sky to celebrates the @entity204 ' second			1

@entity4 beat @entity27 2 - 0 at the @entity5 on *sunday*
@entity63 's penalty and @entity128 's header gave @entity204 victory
@entity13 appeared to go down theatrically to win @entity4 's penalty
@entity13 ran over the outstretched knee of @entity27 captain @entity14
