with her fellow @entity3 team pursuit champions @entity1 and @entity5 already out of the medals in the 3,000m individual pursuit , it fell to @entity8 to reinstate @entity10 pride inside the sir @entity11 on friday			1
she responded by breaking an eight - year - old @entity13 record to reach the final and then obliterated her @entity16 opponent , @entity15 , to win @entity10 ’s first able - bodied cycling gold medal of these games			1
cometh the hour , cometh the woman			0
@entity8 , 25 , said she had been inspired watching her flatmates in the athletes ’ village , @entity23 and pilot @entity24 , win the para-sport sprint tandem on thursday night , as @entity10 finished the opening day in the velodrome with one gold , two silvers and a bronze for @entity31 in the 500m time trial			2
gold : @entity10 's @entity8 came out on top in the 3,000m individual pursuit cycling final unbelievable : the 25 - year - old won an @entity3 gold in the women 's team pursuit and did so in @entity40 well - earned : @entity8 celebrates after winning gold in the women 's 3,000m individual pursuit in @entity40 but , such has been the success of @entity47 cyclists over the past decade , we are not used to settling for silver			1
@entity8 , the world individual and team pursuit champion , duly provided a welcome reminder of why the nation ’s cyclists have been such a dominant force — and why great rivals @entity16 may have to keep quiet for a while longer			1
@entity55 and @entity1 had already missed out on the chance to ride for a medal after they could only post the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively in qualification , meaning the onus was on @entity8 to boost or bust @entity10 hopes in the event			1
she responded gallantly , setting a @entity13 record of 3min 29.038sec , catching and overtaking her opponent @entity65 of @entity66 in the process , and then lapping up the applause of the generous @entity70 crowd			1
she then produced another stunning ride in the final			0
@entity15 , whose younger brother @entity73 also had to settle for silver in the 4,000m individual pursuit , was nearly four seconds behind @entity8 as she staggered over the line			1
there may be more high - profile riders within @entity79 , but the serious way in which @entity8 approached this event touched many on friday			2
congratulations : @entity84 's @entity15 hugs @entity8 after winning silver in the final it was with the @entity88 in mind that she was first spotted by @entity79 ’s talent team on a school field aged 15 in 2004 and the buzz of performing on @entity47 soil is a major motivation			1
it felt fitting that @entity8 ’s beam lit up the velodrome as she stood on the podium yesterday , once again eschewing a wig which would have concealed her alopecia			2
@entity8 said : ‘ i won the world title in february and this is the one i really wanted			2
it ’s all been about preparing for this			0
the @entity13 come round every four years and very rarely so near to your home country			0
‘ when i started , a lot of people doubted me and i ’ve always wanted to prove them wrong			0
i have kept plugging away			0
‘ ever since the @entity109 i have been thinking about this event			0
i ’ve been looking forward to @entity40			0
this has been my motivation since the @entity13 and i ’m pretty pleased to pull it off			0
’ winner : @entity8 says ' it 's been an amazing year , and this was the one i really wanted '			2
