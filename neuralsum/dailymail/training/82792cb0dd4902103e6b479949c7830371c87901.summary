' i played against @entity1 in @entity34 several times and he is a really great player			1
he has so much quality			1
' there are not many players like him left now , i think , but he is one of those i try to look at and learn from as i try to improve the way i play that role			2
' he is a player that has become incredibly important to @entity7			1
i always try to watch these players in this position because there are so few left			2
i know i can learn from them			2
' @entity7 's @entity1 battles for possession with @entity49 's @entity48 @entity0 has come in for criticism in recent weeks and admits he is still adjusting to @entity51			1
' it â€™s always hard to start a life in a new country , changing places and cultures , ' he said			2
' you are trying to adapt on the pitch and away from it , and with things like the language , that is always quite difficult			0
' i have been here for six or seven months now , though , and i am starting to find a little bit of continuity in my work and getting used to things			0
' it is a little different			0
the players here are always running			0
it is a very physical , very strong sort of football			0
it is very intense and i have suffered a bit because of that as i try to adapt			0
@entity0 says he is still adjusting to life in @entity51 following his summer switch to @entity5 ' and then there are things like the conditions you have to play in : it snowed when we played against @entity84 , and it rains a lot			1
' i was prepared for that , though , and i knew that it would always be very difficult when we played away from home			0
these are all the things you have to adapt to , as well as your team and the league itself			0
' i am quite a physical player , a player who likes that part of the game , marking players , to help out his team , to provide support to the players in front of me			0
