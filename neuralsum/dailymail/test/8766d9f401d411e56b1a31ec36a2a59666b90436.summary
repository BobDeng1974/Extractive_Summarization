a woman who works as a professional ‘ humiliatrix ’ has revealed how she earns more than one dollar per minute indulging the subservient fantasies of men around the world			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , takes the more traditional dominatrix idea a step further , not just dominating her customers but demeaning , shaming and generally humiliating them			0
and the 28 - year - old entrepreneur says that making money this way — which she has been doing since she was 17 — has been a dream			1
risqué business : @entity5 , 28 , says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online ; her first pair sold for $ 70 in a recent interview with salon , @entity5 explains that she got started in the industry by accident			1
when she was 17 , @entity5 was on a dating website when one particular suitor intrigued her ; the meaner she was to him , the more interested in her he became			1
she went on to seek out similar men , eventually finding a website called @entity30 where she could sell her used underwear			0
her first pair sold for $ 70			0
a tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online , taking provocative phone calls , and performing live webcam shows			2
taking control : ' guys really like the idea of me ruining them in this way , ' @entity5 says real - life dating : @entity5 says she 's up - front about her job when she 's dating , and she 's had three serious relationships over the course of her career ' i make most of my money from videos , ' she says , adding that custom videos cost $ 1 per minute and subscribers pay a monthly fee of $ 39.99 for access to her site			1
' they are [ point of view ] - style videos , which means it ’s just me and the camera , and i am looking at the camera and talking to the camera so that the viewer feels like i ’m talking to them			0
' ' i just tap into various fetishes and they ’re all just under the umbrella of [ female dominance ]			0
i always play a dominant role , and i tap into things like cuckolding , small penis humiliation , foot fetish , toilet slavery , giantess — which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that ’s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole — different stuff like that			2
' besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that @entity84 sells online , customers can also mail @entity86 cash , buy her gift cards to @entity89 , @entity90 , or a massage parlor , or purchase items off her @entity89 wishlist , which includes a $ 399.99 @entity94 , $ 1,295 @entity96 shoes , and a $ 23 @entity98 adult cosplay costume			2
no secret : friends and family know what @entity5 does for a living , and her dad thought she was a ' genius ' when he learned how she was making money while such interests might scare off some people , @entity5 likes the fact that she is privy to intimate knowledge that her customers do n't necessarily reveal in their personal lives			1
' i think it ’s fascinating and i think it ’s also flattering , in a way , that guys are telling me things that they do n’t tell anyone else , ' she says			0
@entity5 also is n't quite as excited about humiliating her customers as they are about being humiliated , which she says makes it easy for her to compartmentalize and separate her job from her personal life			2
' i do enjoy my work , i think it ’s really fun and i get a kick out of it ... but i definitely do n’t like it in the same way that my clients like it			0
