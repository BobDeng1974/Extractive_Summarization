@entity0 is mourning the loss of ' mad millionaire ' @entity2 - an eccentric tycoon who worshipped socialism even as capitalism made him filthy rich			1
mr @entity2 , who passed away this week at the age of 62 on his third honeymoon , made his fortune in the removals business			1
his distinctive yellow and blue vans were a constant feature in city streets as they packed up and unloaded wares from across the country and the world			1
but he shunned the trappings of wealth			1
he gave most of his cash away , lived in a £ 400 - a - month rented flat , despised ostentatiousness and shopped at discount supermarket @entity21			1
he lived a humble lifestyle despite being a multi-millionaire entrepeneur who made his fortune through his removals business a sculpture of @entity30 stands outside one of mr @entity2 's businesses , which is based in @entity33 he planted a statue of his hero @entity30 next to his @entity37 company yard in the gritty @entity39 section of the city that over four decades became one of the largest removal firms in @entity43			1
he called his business ' @entity33 's best removals collective , ' although in reality he was a dictator - albeit a benevolent one			1
' here the delusions of grandeur are healed every day , ' he said of his workplace			2
he loved @entity33 but he was no native			1
@entity50 moved to the divided , @entity52 city from the @entity54 town of @entity55 at the start of the 1970s because he did not want to be called up to the army			2
@entity33 was unique in @entity0 at the time in that it allowed young men resident within its boundaries to skip military service			1
consequently it was a magnet for thousands like him			2
he half - heartedly set about studying law , but admitted that he was more fond of studying pubs and their contents			2
to finance his legal ambitions he bought a clapped out old transit van and began undercutting established removal firms			2
he could n't drive but found people who could and instead set about the ' hard labour ' of shifting the furniture during moves			0
publicans in particular liked using him			0
he later claimed they were impressed by his three first names which they thought gave him a status he did n't have			0
soon his ' alternative ' removal service became the norm			0
he bought more vans , moved in squatters and doctors , lawyers and anyone who could afford to pay him - or at least promised to			0
mr @entity2 had an estimated fortune of £ 10million tied up in the company , but never took more than £ 300 a month mr @entity2 's company is known across @entity43 for its yellow and blue vans			1
bizarrely he never learned to drive ' @entity88 - owned by the @entity89 , ' he boasted , with a logo on the side of his vans that read : ' mens agitat molem - the spirit moves the mass. ' he charged customers in posher parts of the city , like @entity99 and @entity100 , more than those in the working class districts like wedding and @entity39			0
he split the money between the workers and himself in true socialist style			1
when he died he had an estimated fortune of £ 10million tied up in the company which has 600 employees			1
he never drew a salary of more than £ 300 a month			1
dressed like an @entity113 beatnik poet of the 1960s , with a long flowing beard and heavy rimmed black glasses to match , it was not unusual to see him on city streets at night picking up beer bottles out of litter bins so he could reclaim the deposit money			1
' i do n't need money			2
it just makes us unequal , ' he said in an interview last year			0
' there are just so many bloody idiots with money around , you do n't need another one			2
' married three times , the latest union in june this year , mr @entity2 was on his honeymoon when he died			1
he never bought a flat because he thought it would only contribute to a price - spiral and leave ' ordinary workers ' unable to afford decent housing			0
but he had a sharp business brain and spotted opportunities to expand the business at every turn			0
mr @entity2 set up offices in @entity33 , predicting when the @entity143 fell that the capital would move back to the city when the @entity143 fell he was certain that the capital would move from sleepy @entity147 on the @entity148 to @entity33 - and he was right			1
so he set up a logistics depot there that paid off handsomely when the politicians and civil servants began their great trek eastwards			0
he expanded into overseas removals and opened branch offices across @entity0			2
he was described by the media as a ' genial despot ' who once said at a shareholders meeting : ' the proletarian elite operates well with me ! ' over the past decade he withdrew more and more from public view			0
once a frequengter of @entity165 - @entity0 's @entity164 - functions , he preferred to sit instead in the @entity167 pub , meaning servant , in the @entity170 section of the city in the evenings and drink a few beers and talk with actors , painters , journalists and lawyers			0
on the question of whether he had a role model , he replied : ' oh , yes , the main character from the august trilogy by @entity183 nobel laureate @entity182			0
to do this you need to know : august is a tireless navigator and braggart			0
and the only truly good human being who thinks unselfishly , not like all the others			0
he satirized the economic world , which was fine by me			0
' he died of a heart attack this week , his second in 14 years			1
in his last interview in february this year he said : ' my last move will be to the cemetery in @entity55			0
' and that is where he will be laid to rest , the funeral attended by his sole daughter aged thirteen , friends , former wives and politicians .			0

@entity2 made a £ 10million fortune running a removals company in @entity33
despite wealth he lived a humble life , shopping at @entity21 and giving away cash
often seen picking bottles off streets and returning them for deposit money
died from a heart attack while on a honeymoon with his third wife this week
