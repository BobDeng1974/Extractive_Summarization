prime - time @entity13 drama @entity11 is bucking the trend for white - dominated leading roles in detective series with the introduction of a new character to be played by @entity20 actor @entity19			1
@entity19 will play @entity22 @entity21 , who will be introduced to viewers this month , bringing a little more colour into the cast of the popular @entity8 - set @entity13 programme			1
star of stage and screen : @entity19 as @entity30 in the play @entity31			1
he will play @entity11 's new sidekick in the eponymous @entity13 crime drama it comes two years after the producer of @entity1 was suspended for saying he did not cast black and @entity37 people in the series because he wanted to keep his programme ' the last bastion of @entity41 '			1
@entity42 - born @entity19 , most recently seen in @entity44 sitcom @entity43 , said he did n't believe his casting was a deliberate effort to bring more racial parity to the series			1
' i do n't think my role in @entity11 is political , ' he told the @entity50			1
' i do n't think they were " going black " for the part , as the industry phrase goes			2
' and there has been no attempt to tie his race into the narrative of the drama , the 34 - year - old said , adding : ' the statement is that i am there and i am black			0
' there is no need for them to say anything else			0
' leading man : @entity67 as @entity11			2
@entity19 said he did not believe his casting was a deliberate attempt to bring better racial parity to the series @entity13 crime series have long been dominated by white characters , an unspoken prejudice made explicit two years ago when @entity75 , producer of @entity1 , said he wanted to keep ethnic minorities out of his programme			1
' we are a cosmopolitan society in this country , but if you watch @entity1 you would n’t think so , ' mr @entity75 said in early 2011			2
' i ’ve never been picked up on that , but quite honestly i would n’t want to change it			0
' we just do n’t have ethnic minorities involved , because it would n’t be the @entity5 village then			1
it just would n’t work			0
' suddenly we might be in @entity88			0
' we ’re the last bastion of @entity41 and i want to keep it that way			0
' mr @entity75 was suspended , later announcing he was stepping down as executive producer			0
his replacement , @entity94 , brought in @entity37 cast members @entity95 and @entity97 to help the show ' represent its audience '			2
@entity19 , who grew up in @entity20 , admitted that his race had affected the kinds of roles he was offered as he began his acting career in the @entity104			1
but he said he had a ' slightly different view ' of the problems faced by ethnic minority actors in the @entity104 as black @entity104 actor @entity108 , star of @entity109 , who said he had to go to the @entity110 to land a major role			2
' i do agree with him that the size of the industry out there makes a difference , ' @entity19 said			0
' but it is more competitive there , too			0
' he was in a very big series , but i know several good black actors who are struggling out there			0

casting comes after *controversy* over roles for ethnic minorities in @entity13 crime dramas
producer of @entity1 said two years ago he did n't want to see black and @entity37 faces in his programme
@entity19 will play @entity11 's new sidekick , but says he does n't think his appointment is political
