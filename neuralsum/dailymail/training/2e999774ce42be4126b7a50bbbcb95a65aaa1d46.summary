' recording a verdict of misadventure coroner @entity171 said : ' @entity15 by no means was a habitual drug user			1
this was one of the first times she had tried drugs			2
she was a young girl who had an awful lot to put up with because of the @entity178 and the effects it had on her			0

' bring into the mix someone who not in the most robust of health there are serious questions to be considered			0
there is no evidence that anyone made her take this drug			2
