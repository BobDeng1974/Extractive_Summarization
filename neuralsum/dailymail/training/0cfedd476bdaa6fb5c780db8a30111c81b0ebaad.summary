by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 1 october 2013 thanks to @entity4 's provocative dance routine at the @entity5 last month , popstars , satirists and exhibitionists have jumped on the twerking bandwagon			1
@entity10 is awash with people parodying @entity4 's moves and the @entity13 previously reported how it has sparked a fitness craze with people keen to tone up with a ' twerk out '			2
but while the former @entity19 star may be credited with the recent revival of the bent over , derriere - jiggling move , a yoga instructor has revealed that it can be traced back centuries before the 20 - year - old started shaking her booty			1
causing controversy : @entity4 twerks with @entity26 at the @entity5 @entity27 , 33 , told the @entity28 : ' although twerking can be traced back as far as 20 years in pop and hip hop culture , its roots may very well rest in the ancient traditions of yoga from thousands of years ago			1
' the word most likely comes from the words work and twist			0
the combination creates a sexually charged dance move with thrusting hips and low squatting stance			0
' centuries - old : @entity4 sparked a new trend for twerking but a yoga instructor said the move belonged to them first @entity27 , who runs yoga classes in @entity49 , said it 's been a ' no brainer ' to include the move in her sessions recently			1
not only because it 's what the @entity4 - inspired customers want , but because she said it works so well as a yoga move by engaging the chakra			1
she explains : ' yoga teaches an energy system within the body involving various energy points known as chakras			0
they basically move from our root , up the spine , to the crown			0
' @entity70 chakra work with a bit of a twerk which is a sexually - charged move really helps this area - and it 's proven very popular so far			2
' @entity27 said twerking works well as a yoga move because it engages the chakra @entity27 is n't the only fitness instructor to start incorporate twerking into her classes			1
@entity79 , creator of fitness programmes including @entity81 , told @entity13 earlier this month how it received a number of requests for a class featuring twerking moves following the @entity5			2
they adapted their existing @entity88 class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves and are even considering changing the class 's name to the @entity93			0
place your hands on your hips , with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes to go forward , press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward to go back , the fingers pull back on the hip bone squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section for a more pronounced twerk , rest the hands on the knees , with the wrists facing out then up the tempo and shake the butt directions provided by @entity115 and it 's not just in the pop and fitness world that twerking is taking off			1
the @entity120 recently added the word with the definition : ' the twerk , v. : dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low , squatting stance			2
' @entity129 , from @entity120 , said ' twerk ' was around 20 years old and was coined as part of the ' bounce ' hip - hop scene in the @entity133 ' by last year , it had generated enough currency to be added to our new words watch list , and by this spring , we had enough evidence of usage frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our dictionaries of current @entity145 , ' she said recently			1
' there are many theories about the origin of this word , and since it arose in oral use , we may never know the answer for sure			0
she added : ' the current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s , when it was first popularised by @entity159 € ™ s song , the twist			0
only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public			0

pop star did provocative twerking dance at @entity5
sparked numerous parodies and *demand* for ' twerk out ' exercise classes
@entity171 was around 20 years ago on hip hop scene
but yoga instructor @entity27 says it goes back even further
she said it was a yoga move thousands of years ago
move engages the chakra
