' detectives are now believed to be trying to identify the couple as part of an ongoing review into the case - codenamed @entity69			1
@entity71 and @entity72 hold their twins @entity53 and @entity55 at the @entity74 in 2007 the @entity41 in @entity36 where @entity75 disappeared			0
@entity22 police refuse to reopen the case the investigation is now thought to be focusing on a small number of apartment blocks close to block 5 , where the @entity72 family were staying			1
the investigation includes identifying the owners , holidaymakers and those who may have illegally been subletting the flats at the time @entity42 disappeared			0
blocks four and six , which are situated either side of the @entity72 building , and block two , which is behind their apartment , are the central to the investigation			0
there are fears that someone staying in the complex may have been able to watch the family 's movements from their flat			1
among those detectives want to speak to are @entity3 cleaners and ' low - level ' workers , such as handymen and gardeners , @entity106 learned			1
some are thought to have been employed by the @entity41 complex on a casual basis and may have already been interviewed			0
police are said to be keen to trace six @entity3 cleaners who were working in @entity36 when @entity42 vanished and who did not appear in the @entity22 files			2

detective chief superintendent @entity147 , head of @entity9 ’s @entity148 , said this week that he believes @entity42 may still be alive - despite it being five years since her disappearance			1
he said : ' you only have to look at the case in @entity153 , @entity154 , and the @entity156 cases			0
of course there is a possibility she is alive			0
but the key is to investigate the case and , alive or dead , we should be able to try and discern what happened			0
’ despite the extraordinary amount of publicity @entity42 's disappearance generated , she has not been seen since may , 2007			0
senior met police officers believe @entity42 ( pictured left , and in an artist 's impression of how she may look aged nine , right ) may still be alive and said the @entity153 kidnappings show there could still be hope @entity174 , who was at the tapas bar with the @entity33 , told police she saw a man carrying a child the night @entity42 disappeared			1
however , no one has ever been traced			0
detectives examining the @entity22 files were alarmed that the original inquiry had not traced and interviewed all the staff and holidaymakers who were at the @entity41 when @entity42 went missing			1
last year the @entity185 said that it had identified 195 fresh leads that should have been investigated either by conducting further witness interviews , eliminating suspects or carrying out forensic tests that were missing from the 2007 inquiry			1
officers found unexplained gaps in the investigation timeline and that there had been a complete lack of forensic examination of mobile phone activity in the area on the night @entity42 disappeared			0
however , police in @entity22 said they would only reopen the case if new evidence came to light			2
a spokesman for the @entity33 said earlier this week : ‘ they have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry			2
