it is believed to be under new ownership and changes its name ' there is nothing evidentially that links these cases at present although we would never rule it out but as with @entity5 , i would also ask people to remember @entity15 and , again , let us know if there 's anything they have been keeping to themselves about what happened to her , ' he said			1
' we know that people are more confident in coming forward to report historic information nowadays and this may be the case here			0
