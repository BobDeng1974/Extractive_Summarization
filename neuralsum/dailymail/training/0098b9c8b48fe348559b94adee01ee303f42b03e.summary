by @entity0 for @entity1 dinosaurs walked the earth about nine million years earlier than once realised , with recent discoveries of their cat and dog - sized ancestors providing the key to understanding their evolution			1
research has revealed small creatures which roamed the earth 245million years ago are likely to have been the immediate ancestors of dinosaurs such as the @entity15 and velociraptor			1
one of these is a labrador - sized carnivore , first discovered in @entity19 , which had a metre long tail and lived alongside other reptile - type species 243million years ago			1
@entity23 , pictured in the foreground , was an ancestor to the dinosaurs and about the size of a labrador the footprints of another were discovered in a @entity30 quarry			2
this creature , from around the same time period , was the size of a house cat and is also thought to be part of the dinosaur lineage			0
paleontologist @entity37 , from the @entity38 , wrote in a research paper that the recent discoveries of what were called ' dinosauromorphs ' have ' placed the @entity30 @entity44 record as a key to understanding the ascent of dinosaurs '			0
he added the @entity30 quarry footprints , which he worked on , ' may provide a new frontier in understanding the evolution of early dinosaurs '			2
the dated footprints shifted the origin of the dinosaur back to between 249 - 251million years ago , which was up to nine million years earlier than indicated by dinosaur body fossils and footprint records			1
it was also only a few million years after the @entity59 / @entity44 mass extinction of 252million years ago			1
the upper arm and six vertebrae of @entity23 , which was found in @entity62 in the 1930s the fossilized upper arm and six vertebrae of @entity23 , were found in what is modern day @entity62 , @entity19 , in the 1930s			0
@entity23 , which means ' @entity69 lizard ' , was named after the lake in the region known as @entity72 when it was a @entity73 colony until 1964			0
they date from just a few million years after the ' @entity74 ' , the greatest of all time , and provide important insight into the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs			0
all life on @entity81 today is descended from the four per cent of species that survived the mysterious event 252 million years ago that may have been caused by an asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions			1
the extinction was caused by a volcanic eruption , which in turn triggered global warming and a climate which wiped out 96 per cent of all living species			0
it was during the planet 's recovery from this event that dinosaurs flourished before their extinction about 65million years ago			2
mr @entity37 wrote in a recent blog : ' although most attention has been focused on the dinosaur extinction , arguably a more interesting question is how and why the dinosaurs became so successful in the first place			0

@entity104 evolved from small cat and dog - sized creatures 249m years ago
the species survived a mass extinction , after which dinosaurs evolved
footprints found in @entity30 and bones in @entity19 give clues about creatures
