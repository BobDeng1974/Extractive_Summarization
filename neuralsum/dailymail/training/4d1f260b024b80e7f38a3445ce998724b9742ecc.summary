@entity1 manager @entity0 has sounded a warning over @entity3 being expected to be @entity5 's match - winner at the @entity6			1
the 20 - year - old 's inclusion on @entity9 's squad has excited many with former @entity5 striker @entity11 the latest in a long line to liken the midfielder to the mercurial @entity14			2
however , @entity3 's club manager believes putting too much pressure on the player , not matter how talented he is , will be detrimental to his development			1
@entity5 star : @entity9 has selected @entity3 in his 23 - man @entity6 squad for this summer he 's only young : his @entity1 manager @entity0 says the midfielder must be protected ' you can never get an experience like playing in a @entity6 too soon if you are ready and @entity3 is ready , ' @entity0 said			1
' what is important is , as a nation , we have a responsibility to look after a young man who goes to the @entity6 with the only intention of helping @entity5 be as good as they can			1
' he is still young and we have to protect him			2
if we protect him well we are talking about a potential world - class talent			2
' but it is down to us to allow him time and a little bit of a path to fulfil his potential with @entity5			2
' we should n't expect @entity3 , at the age of 20 , to go into a @entity6 and be someone who has to win games single - handedly			1
that would be very wrong			0
' @entity9 's squad has a significant youthful element to it with @entity3 joined by @entity47 left - back @entity46 , 18 , @entity49 forward @entity48 , 19 , and 20 - year - old @entity51 midfielder @entity50			1
impressive : @entity3 has taken the @entity52 by storm this season their inclusion has added a vibrancy and unpredictability to the national side but @entity0 stressed they should not bear the burden of unrealistic expectation			1
' my message to every @entity65 fan and supporter in general is that we should embrace the younger generation - and it is phenomenal to have that - who have been called up by the @entity5 manager			0
' but we have to understand we carry a responsibility of allowing the young players to have a positive experience , whatever that is			0
' then we can allow them to grow and put them in a position where they have ( played ) 300 to 400 games and can then be tested and pushed to see if they can win a @entity6			1
' at the moment it is making sure they are protected in their environment , are allowed to enjoy their football and whatever they bring to the occasion is going to be a great learning curve for the future			0
' like any job in any line of work you are better by the experience you get and it is having the opportunity to make mistakes and grow and just become better out of that			0
high praise : he has been compared to @entity14 with his drive from midfield and dribbling ' whatever they bring to this @entity6 is a bonus			1
we should be looking further ahead to see the results of these youngsters			0
' experience in a @entity6 has to be a positive one whatever the results are			2
' but it is something we do quite often - we build the expectations and then lose the opportunity of fulfilling that potential and having a special player for the future			0
' we are not the only ones , there are many nations who build expectations so quickly and then put them on young shoulders and that is unfair			0
' there is not a written rule of what you should do			0
you should allow them to enjoy the experience , whatever it is , and then set the next target for them and continually evaluate them and give them an area to improve and focus on			0

@entity3 must be looked after at the @entity6 , says @entity0
