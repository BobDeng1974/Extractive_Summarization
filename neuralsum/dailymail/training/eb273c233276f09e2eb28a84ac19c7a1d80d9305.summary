@entity8 and @entity9 featured but the show was stolen by an unlikely hero			2
host commentator they got there eventually ... but @entity6 were a little lucky this evening			0
mistakes persisted at the back , and @entity7 hit the post three times			2
now it 's time for @entity20 ! 90mins : three minutes added ... can @entity6 hang on ? 86mins : but @entity7 come back into it ! new burst of energy for the hosts , but @entity24 fires his volley over from inside the box			1
what a debut ! @entity6 finally break the deadlock and it 's the teenager who gets it			2
@entity8 pokes his cross through the goalkeepers legs and @entity34 taps the ball in from a yard out			1
not his best goal i 'm sure , but surely the biggest of his life so far			0
77mins : close again ! @entity8 's deflected effort skims the post after a neat cut back from @entity44			1
desperate , but strong defending from the hosts today			0
75mins : last throw of the dice for @entity48 and he opts to bring on experience in the shape of club captain @entity51			0
72mins : @entity7 should be leading			0
@entity53 hits the post from the edge of the box and @entity58 's follow up is fired across goal			1
surely there 's a goal in this one ? 71mins : what a time to get your debut as a 19 - year - old ... 68mins : @entity6 have n't come closer than that			1
@entity8 is played through down the right and his cross finds @entity9 in the six yard box			1
unfortunately for him , his shot is somehow blocked on the floor by @entity71 , getting anything in the way			0
think it came off his back in the end , anything to prevent that first goal			0
66mins : not many players strike a free - kick towards goal from nearly 40 yards			1
but not many players are @entity8			0
the forward 's effort is dipping towards goal when @entity85 makes an acrobatic save ... may have been going wide though			1
60mins : @entity9 is on and straight away @entity6 's pace quickens			1
the @entity91 passes out wide to @entity89 whose dangerous cross is hacked away			2
then @entity9 's near post flick on from the corner nearly finds @entity94			1
56mins : i do n't think @entity7 can last much longer playing like this			0
@entity6 have enjoyed over 70 per cent possession so far , and the hosts are n't even trying to break away right now			0
they 're well and truly camped in their own half			0
and what makes things worse , @entity9 is warming up ... 50mins : this time it 's @entity6 who are defending nervously ! new signing @entity94 has to get something on a dangerous cross but he so nearly diverts it into his own net ... @entity110 watches the ball onto the post			1
away we go again ! and while we 're at it , here 's the @entity20 team to play @entity117 : @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 goalless at the break then , @entity6 need to step things up a notch here			2
mind you , they do have a certain @entity91 on the bench ... 42mins : ' tasty ' atmosphere now			0
the crowd cheer as @entity44 is booked after complaining about a high challenge from @entity138			0
after starting brightly , @entity6 's pace has dropped and @entity7 are defending and attacking reasonably comfortably			1
37mins : @entity140 is booked after clearly impeding @entity58 as the forward tried to break clear			2
34mins : @entity7 still holding firm , and now looking dangerous themselves			0
when they do get the ball , they are playing it a little quicker than the visitors			0
28mins : @entity6 so nearly net the opener , as @entity8 's free - kick troubles @entity85			1
@entity149 deflects the goalbound effort further towards the corner , and in truth the stopper does well to divert it onto the post			2
23mins : short set piece from @entity7 and @entity58 's cross finds his way to the back post ... but how @entity71 somehow misses ! the ball bounces up and hits the defenders thigh from six yards out , looping over the bar			1
19mins : unsavoury update now			0
last year a banana was thrown at @entity44 at this ground , before the right back promptly through ait back and drew praise throughout the world of football			2
today , the @entity91 is being booed by the home fans ... 15mins : close ! finally @entity6 click into gear			2
@entity8 feeds @entity140 on the left , whose stinging drive on his weaker foot is well saved by @entity177			1
the hosts need to be careful not to give the ball away like that in their own half			0
11mins : the tempo is set for this one			0
@entity6 having all the possession , with the odd counter attack from the hosts			0
@entity187 ( on loan from @entity20 ) and @entity58 will trouble @entity94 and @entity189			1
6mins : very nervy defending from @entity7 so far			0
first a hacked clearance nearly puts @entity8 in , then the @entity190 has to hack the ball clear after a dangerous cross from @entity140			1
looking good here , are @entity48 's @entity6			2
3mins : @entity6 starting off lively here , with two early shots			0
@entity198 's effort from a corner is scuffed wide before @entity8 hits a similarly week effort straight at @entity85 in the hosts ' goal			1
we 're expecting to see @entity198 left , @entity204 , @entity140 on the right			2
there 's also a chance for new signings @entity110 , @entity94 and @entity89 to impress			1
so , with just ten minutes until kick - off lets look at those teams			0
@entity58 will be the main familiar face for the hosts , the @entity214 and @entity6 winger , while @entity9 is back on the bench for the @entity217 giants			1
