by @entity0 a judge who allowed a paedophile to walk free in a case where the 13 - year - old victim was described as a ' predator ' was forced to alter his sentence today , but still failed to jail him or apologise			1
@entity8 , 41 , was given a suspended sentence last week after judge @entity10 said the child may have looked and acted older than her years			1
the judge today called back @entity8 because his sentence contained an error and added four months to his initial eight months in jail , still suspended for two years			1
but separate to this the attorney general 's office has confirmed it is still investigating if this is too lenient , and will come to a decision in the next 21 days			1
under fire : judge @entity10 is being investigated for suggesting the victim was ' egging on ' paedophile @entity8 , and today he was forced to change his sentence because of a technicality but still failed to jail him the case caused controversy when @entity25 , the barrister prosecuting in the case , had labelled the young girl ' predatory ' and ' sexually experienced ' and has been suspended from similar cases			1
judge @entity10 then repeated his comments and is also being investigated for telling @entity8 the girl was ‘ egging you on ’			1
the @entity34 described mr @entity25 's remarks as ' inappropriate ' and suspended him from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review			1
judge @entity10 is currently being investigated by the judicial watchdog and this morning decided to extend the sentence to 12 months after ruling two counts of possessing indecent images , for which @entity8 was given four months imprisonment suspended for two years , should run consecutively			1
he made no reference to the storm surrounding the case during the 10 - minute hearing			2
explaining the decision to @entity8 , who appeared via videolink from @entity50 , the judge told him : ' i have had the matter listed before me today as part of the sentence , not that part relating to sexual activity with a child , requires correcting			1
' it was not appreciated by the parties that i could not pass a community order with a supervision requirement for three years to run alongside a suspended sentence on the same indictment or indeed another indictment sentenced on the same occasion			1
' in amending the sentence i have sought to ensure that all parts of the order will be complied with by the defendant and that any breach will be brought before a court and consideration given to further penalty , including immediate imprisonment			2
' ' disgrace ' : barrister @entity25 has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13 - year - old victim of a sex abuse case ' predatory ' and was replaced at today 's hearing @entity79 had condemned a prosecution barrister and had urged the courts to ‘ stand up for victims ’ after @entity8 , 41 , escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home , where she performed a sex act on him			1
' it is n’t appropriate			0
we need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims			0
the victims should always be at the centre of our thinking			0
‘ the cps themselves have said that this is n’t appropriate , the attorney general is going to look into the case and we need a system that properly stands up for victims			1
’ child protection campaigners labelled barrister @entity25 a ‘ disgrace ’ and called for his dismissal			1
they also warned that his ‘ crass ’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward			2
mr @entity25 has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told @entity103 in @entity104 that the girl ‘ forced ’ herself on @entity8 , describing her as ‘ predatory in all her actions ’ and ‘ sexually experienced ’			1
he said : ‘ she appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 - year - old			0
there was sexual activity but it was not of mr @entity8 ’s doing			1
‘ you might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her			0
’ @entity8 admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child			1
his own solicitor told monday ’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children			2
@entity127 , director of child protection charity @entity128 , said : ‘ this needs to be nipped in the bud			0
are we in 1913 or 2013 ? judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this			0
‘ vulnerable witnesses wo n’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court			0
they are fragile children , they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case			0
' @entity143 , @entity144 ’s shadow attorney general , said : ‘ it is appalling that after the scandals of @entity149 and @entity150 these awful @entity147 prejudices are still being served up in court , and by the prosecution of all people			1
’ she has written to the @entity153 to examine whether mr @entity25 violated its code of conduct			1
investigation : the @entity34 has launched a probe following the case at @entity160 , which returned there this morning @entity162 also condemned the teenager ’s treatment			1
its chief executive @entity165 said : ‘ it is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered			0
‘ the state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses , which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected			0
we have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial , aggressive courts system			0
’ there was further anger as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor ’s comments			2
@entity185 , a barrister for @entity186 , tweeted : ‘ it takes two to tango			0
disgusting tho ’ these men are , frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs			0
’ the @entity34 said : ‘ the word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the @entity34			1
the director of public prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken			0
the attorney general ’s office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘ as a possibly unduly lenient sentence ’			1
the @entity204 said it would consider a number of complaints it had received shock : @entity8 's crimes led to a suspended sentence where the girl victim was accused of egging him on ( posed by model ) @entity8 spotted his victim amid the bustle of @entity216 town centre at the start of march last year			1
the 13 - year - old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes			0
@entity8 obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet			1
he then took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee			0
the girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years			2
however , she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than @entity8 who was 39 at the time			1
over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘ fling ’ , @entity160 heard			0
the girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘ sexual predator ’			1
but during this time it was @entity8 who bombarded her with phone calls and text messages as she continued to visit his home , the court heard			2
on march 20 , exactly two weeks after her first visit , the girl went back to @entity8 ’s flat after they agreed to meet			2
they sat in his lounge and talked about their relationship			0
@entity8 claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble			2
the girl , who was dressed in her school uniform , asked if she could change out of it and @entity8 left the room			2
when he returned she had undressed and was sat wearing a t - shirt			0
@entity8 claims he asked her to put her clothes on , but she started kissing him before touching his genitals			2
he said he pushed her away and told her he did not want to see her any more			0
at no point did they have sex			0
@entity25 , prosecuting , told the court that the sexual activity was ‘ not of mr @entity8 ’s doing ’			1
he added : ‘ you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her			0
’ the abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called			0
when officers went to @entity8 ’s home , they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer			2
four of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or varying degrees of nakedness			0
there were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs			0
@entity8 told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer .			2
