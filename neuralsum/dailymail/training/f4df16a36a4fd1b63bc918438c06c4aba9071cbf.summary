@entity6 ' @entity5 and @entity7 made history on their apollo 8 flight in 1968 , and in doing so named craters and features along their orbital path after crew members and relatives			1
but 40 years after their incredible feat , they have discovered that the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has selected different craters to mark their flight			1
the lunar surface taken from @entity20 ' and @entity7 's apollo 8 spacecraft looking southward			2
they named key features but now find these have been ' moved ' to the dark side not visible from @entity25 and these craters are on the far - dark - side of the moon , which is not visible from @entity25			1
the @entity16 chose these craters in 1970 , according to the @entity30 , but the apparent snub has just come to light after the agency advertised it was using public campaigns to name celestial bodies including the moon 's landmarks			2
appalled at their mission 's apparent unimportance , mr @entity20 wrote to the journal the @entity42 , saying : ' i thought these names would have some priority , but when the @entity16 honoured our crew with crater names , it picked three craters that were not only well out of sight of our orbital track , but also in darkness at the time of our mission			1
' the letter , seen by the @entity30 , goes on to say that he wrote to the @entity16 to try to correct crater - naming discrepancies			2
but he says he was ' brushed off by its bureaucracy '			0
making history : @entity20 , pictured right in 1968 , made history when he and @entity64 , left , orbited the moon for the first time and named some its key features on their @entity70 mission they got the first glimpse of the @entity25 from the far side of the moon he also provided the @entity16 with a map of the @entity70 flight path , to show how the craters and landmarks along its orbit were chosen , and he says the agency kept his map and never got it back			1
one of the named landscapes was a small mountain on the shore of the @entity85 , which had no name			0
' i observed it on @entity70 and called it @entity90 , after my wife			0
it was used as the starting points for the descents of @entity96 and 11 , ' he said in his letter			0
he wrote that although the @entity16 does not officially recognise the name , ' it is embedded in space - flight history '			1
some of the key features of the moon that are visible form @entity25 - none of which are names chosen by astronauts @entity20 and @entity7 the @entity16 has said the issue is now in the hands of the agency 's general secretary			1
@entity111 8 was the first manned circumlunar flight of the moon , and it carried out 10 orbits in 20 hours			0
it was also the first manned flight of the @entity117 rocket			0
the crew were the first people to see the @entity120 and to get a glimpse of @entity25 over the lunar horizon with their own eyes			0
live television pictures were broadcast to @entity25			0
founded in 1919 , when the idea of space exploration began to look like it could one day be a reality , the @entity126 - based @entity16 has long - held the role of naming celestial features			2
its announcement this summer that it would open the naming process up to members of the public marks a shift to try democratise the process , but strict rules still apply .			0

@entity20 and @entity64 were the first astronauts to orbit the moon
on their mission they named key features of the moon , embedded in history
40 years later , they find out their namings have been moved to the ' dark ' side
outraged @entity5 tried to solve the issue but was ' brushed off ' by the @entity16
