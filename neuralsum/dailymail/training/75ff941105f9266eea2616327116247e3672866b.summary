by @entity1 reporter published : 10:06 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 10 october 2013 now in terrible health : @entity3 , seen in this undated photo , is morbidly obese and in danger of dying at any moment , according to his lawyers @entity3 is in terrible shape after 11 years as a prisoner at @entity11 , a fact even the @entity14 military does not dispute			1
lawyers for mr @entity16 , and the doctors they have brought down to the @entity14 base in @entity19 to examine him , paint a dire picture — a morbidly obese man with diabetes and a range of other serious ailments			1
he is short of breath , barely able to walk 10 feet , unable to stay awake in meetings and faces the possibility of not making it out of prison alive			1
' we are very afraid that he is at a high risk of death , that he could die at any moment , ' said @entity36 lt. col. @entity35 , a military lawyer appointed to represent @entity38 about the condition of mr @entity16 , who has admitted being an @entity41 explosives trainer but is no longer facing charges , are emerging in a series of recently filed court motions that provide a rare glimpse into the health of an unusual prisoner , and a preview of arguments that may become more common as the @entity11 prison ages into a second decade with no prospects for closure in sight			2
he 's not the only one of the 164 prisoners at @entity11 who is seriously ill. last week , a judge ordered the release of a schizophrenic @entity59 man who spent much of the past decade medicated in the prison psych ward			1
his lawyers argued he was so sick , with ailments that also included diabetes , that he could n't possibly pose a threat and therefore the @entity14 no longer had the authority to hold him			1
the judge 's ruling came after the government withdrew its opposition to his @entity71 's also a @entity70 prisoner , @entity69 , with a heart condition serious enough that the government brought a surgical team and a mobile cardiac lab to the @entity14 base in @entity19 to treat him , at a cost of $ 400,000			1
he ultimately refused the treatment because he did n't trust military medical personnel.in addition , two prisoners have died from natural causes — one from a heart attack , the other from cancer			2
and several detainees have raised medical complaints related to their participation in a long - running hunger strike , which had dropped to 17 prisoners as of monday from a peak of 106 in july			2
also in rough shape : @entity95 ( left ) and @entity96 ( right ) are also in poor health , said their lawyers ' there are a whole slew of people with a whole slew of serious health problems , ' said @entity105 , a lawyer for the @entity107 human rights group @entity106 who has been meeting with @entity11 prisoners for @entity111 officials say @entity11 prisoners get excellent medical care , saying proudly that it 's equivalent to what troops receive			2
there are more than 100 doctors , nurses and other professionals treating " a constellation " of illnesses , said @entity124 capt. @entity123 , a physician and the chief medical officer for the detention center			0
he says none is in critical condition at the moment			0
' they are an aging population and they are starting to show some signs of being an older group of people , ' mr @entity123 said			0
no escape : prison cells in @entity138 where prisoners are housed in a communal facility in august , lawyers for mr @entity16 filed an emergency motion with a federal court in @entity144 asking a judge to order the military to provide what it calls ' adequate ' medical care , including additional tests for possible heart disease and a device to help him breathe because of a condition they say is preventing his brain from receiving enough @entity158 government insists he is getting good care at @entity11 and just needs to exercise more and eat less			1
' while ( mr @entity16 ) is currently in poor health , his life is not in imminent danger , ' lawyers for the @entity165 wrote in @entity167 judge has n't ruled , but the request is secondary anyway			0
what mr @entity16 and his lawyers want is for the @entity14 to release him , preferably back home to @entity172			1
they argue in part that his health is too poor for him to pose any kind of threat			0
' it boggles the mind that they are putting up a fight on releasing him , ' mr @entity35 said			0
let him go : multiple prison officials have recommended mr @entity16 for release because of his declining health mr @entity16 , who is 5 feet , 10 inches , was around 215 pounds when he arrived at @entity11 in may 2002 after his capture in @entity186			1
photos from before his capture show a man with a bit of girth but not in apparently ill health			0
one of his lawyers , @entity194 , says he was obese by the time she first met him in march 2006			0
' when he first got to @entity11 11 years ago he was not obese , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' and during those 11 years he was under the custody , control and medical supervision of the @entity14 government			1
' mr @entity16 at one point faced charges of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism			0
the government withdrew those charges and told his lawyers that prosecutors had no intention of filing them again for reasons that have not been made public			2
he has reportedly cooperated with interrogators and court documents contain redacted passages dealing with his time in custody but his lawyers decline to comment on the @entity215 lawyers hope to either to win a ruling either from the court or from a review board of government officials that will be re-evaluating the prisoners in custody			1
mr @entity16 has received letters of recommendation from three former @entity11 commanders , a rare , if unprecedented , string of endorsements			0
in better times : @entity16 , in this undated photo , was once in much better health than he is now in one letter , retired @entity232 maj. gen. @entity231 called him a unique prisoner who was ' unlike the violent @entity236 extremists who formed much of the population at @entity11			0
' another , rear adm. @entity238 , noted his ' restricted mobility due to obesity and other health issues ' in recommending his release.most striking is a letter from an official whose name and job title are redacted for security reasons			0
he spent several hours a week with the prisoner over 18 months at @entity11 and says mr @entity16 has been ' friendly and cooperative ' with @entity14 personnel			1
' frankly , i felt @entity252 was a good man on the other side who , in a different world , different time , different place , could easily be accepted as a friend or neighbor			2

@entity3 is short of breath , barely able to walk and can not stay awake in meetings
multiple prison officials have recommended his release , one even said he *'d* make a good neighbor
the @entity14 government contends he needs to exercise more and eat less
