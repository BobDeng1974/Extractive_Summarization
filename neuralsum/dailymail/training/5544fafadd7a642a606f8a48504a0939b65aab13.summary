more than three years after his death , legendary @entity1 ceo @entity0 held an @entity4 courtroom transfixed today as attorneys played a video of his testimony in a class - action lawsuit that accuses @entity1 of inflating prices by locking music lovers into using @entity1 's @entity12 players			1
looking gaunt and pale , @entity0 spoke softly during the deposition he gave six months before his death in october 2011			0
despite this , he gave a firm defense of @entity1 's software , which blocked music from services that competed with @entity1 's @entity20			2
' we were very scared ' : video testimony from @entity0 recorded months before his death was today shown in court as @entity1 is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market			1
earlier this week , lawyers claimed it had deliberately deleted rivals ' song from @entity12 from 2007 to 2009			1
but , the tech giant has challenged the suit after presenting evidence suggesting the plaintiffs ' models of @entity12 may be invalid ' we were very scared ' of the prospect that hackers could break @entity1 's security system , @entity0 said , because that might jeopardize @entity1 's contracts with music recording companies that did n't want their songs to be pirated			1
' we would get nasty emails from the labels , ' he added			0
@entity0 was known for having a short temper			0
but he seemed unruffled when an attorney for the plaintiffs read part of an email in which the @entity1 ceo demanded that a record company executive publicly apologize for praising rival @entity51 for producing software that would make songs from the @entity51 store play on @entity1 's ipods			0
dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans , @entity0 appeared impatient at times and swiveled in his chair during the session , which was recorded at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity62 , @entity63			0
he said he did n't remember why he was upset with the recording executive			0
but he acknowledged that he had proposed language for an @entity1 press release that condemned @entity51 as a ' hacker			0
' ' we are stunned that @entity51 has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the @entity12 , and we are investigating the implications of their actions ' under federal law , the release said			0
@entity1 used anti-piracy software that ensured only songs from its own @entity20 could be played on its @entity12 devices			2

dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans , @entity0 appeared impatient at times and swivelled in his chair during the interview session shown in court , which was recorded at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity62 , @entity63			0
@entity1 is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market , and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals ' song from @entity12			1
the case went to trial in @entity63 this week , after being filed a decade ago			1
plaintiffs are claiming that @entity1 's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed @entity1 to sell ipods at inflated prices			0
they are seeking $ 350 million ( £ 224m ) in damages , which could be tripled if the jury finds @entity1 broke federal anti-trust law			1
@entity1 stopped using the particular software in question in 2009 , which means the lawsuit only covers @entity12 models bought between september 2006 and march 2009			1
on wednesday , the prosecution told the court that @entity1 deleted songs from ipods that had been bought from rival music stores			2
each time an @entity1 user with @entity121 music tried to sync their devices , between 2007 and 2009 , the tech firm urged them to restore the players to factory settings			2
and the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files , and cause the users ' music libraries to ' blow up			2
' but @entity1 insisted the move was a legitimate security measure			0
now , @entity1 has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought @entity12 models covered by the lawsuit			1
attorneys for a group of consumers and @entity12 resellers contend say that froze rival device - makers out of the market , allowing @entity1 to sell ipods at inflated prices			2
the plaintiffs are seeking $ 350 million in damages , which could be tripled if the jury agrees @entity1 violated antitrust rules			1
jurors saw the video on the fourth day of trial in a case that has been rocked by an unusual development			0
@entity1 attorneys late thursday said neither of the women named as plaintiffs purchased ipods equipped with the restrictive software during the timeframe covered by the lawsuit , which is september 2006 to march 2009			1
@entity1 lawyer @entity168 formally asked the judge on friday to dismiss the case because the two women ca n't claim to have suffered the harm alleged in the suit			2
the motion came after plaintiff @entity175 testified wednesday and , in response to questions , showed an @entity12 that she said she bought in 2008			2
@entity168 said @entity1 checked the serial number later in the day and found it was actually purchased in july 2009			1
attorneys who brought the suit had already conceded that @entity12 purchased by the other plaintiff , @entity181 , were n't covered by the suit			0
they agreed friday to drop @entity183 from the case , but plaintiffs ' attorney @entity185 said @entity175 is still eligible to proceed because she has receipts showing she bought two other ipods in september 2008			2
when @entity168 countered that @entity1 's records show those two @entity12 were purchased by @entity175 's husband 's law firm , @entity189 said @entity175 was authorized to use the firm 's credit card for her own purchases			1
the judge asked @entity189 to submit a formal response to @entity168 's arguments over the weekend , but @entity199 did n't say when she 'll make a decision			0
claimants say @entity1 's ( co-founder @entity0 is pictured ) restrictive software froze out competitors			0
@entity1 stopped using the software in 2009 , which means the lawsuit only covers models bought until march 2009			1
but serial numbers show plaintiff @entity175 's @entity12 was bought in july 2009 @entity1 insists its move was a legitimate security measure			1
security director @entity210 said in court that his company was protecting users from hackers and malware by removing @entity216 downloaded from outside of @entity218			0
now , @entity1 has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought @entity12 models covered by the lawsuit			1
plaintiffs are claiming @entity1 's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed @entity1 to sell ipods at inflated prices			0
they are seeking $ 350 million ( £ 224m ) in damages , which could be tripled if the jury finds @entity1 broke federal anti-trust law			1
@entity1 stopped using the particular software in question in 2009 , which means the lawsuit only covers @entity12 models bought between september 2006 and march 2009			1
this means the colourful @entity81 , released in september 2009 , and later generations of the devices are not covered .			0
