cold mist and firework smoke gave the @entity2 a peculiar type of gloom that perfectly symbolised @entity6 's current malaise as they limped to a latest damaging @entity8 defeat			1
it was n't just the result that set the alarm bells ringing for @entity13 's richest club – it was the attitude of their players , most particularly @entity16 , and supporters which will have @entity18 demanding answers			2
manager @entity20 was dignified afterwards , refusing to blame referee @entity21 , who sent off two @entity6 players , failed to dismiss an already - booked @entity24 player for shoving @entity25 , and then denied @entity25 an injury - time penalty			1
when @entity6 were struggling in the third tier of @entity43 football , their supporters were known as the best in the country			2
but now they are among @entity47 's elite – or at least trying to join them – there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the @entity2 compared to @entity52 or @entity53			2
after seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against @entity56 , @entity6 allowed fans to buy two - for - one against @entity24			1
it swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere			0
even the protest against @entity47 by booing the @entity8 anthem was a bit half - hearted			0
the first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval with the team 2 - 1 down			1
a @entity6 fan holds up a banner in protest against @entity47 after @entity24 fans defied their ban at the end , the @entity6 fans were roused to shout ' cheat ' at the referee – it was all very bitter and negative rather than getting behind the team from the off			1
then again , can you blame the fans when some of the players appeared surprisingly disinterested and distracted ? some of @entity87 's defending was extreme to the maximum			0
he conceded a free - kick that allowed @entity90 to head the opening goal for @entity24			1
even worse , after @entity16 had equalised with a trademark free - kick , @entity87 hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent			1
three touches later , @entity90 had beaten @entity97 to restore @entity99 's lead			0
@entity87 - who made mistakes for both goals - looks dejected as @entity90 celebrates and then there 's @entity16			1
for so long the idol of @entity6 's fans who did n't begrudge his status as the @entity107 's best player , he has developed into a caricature of a sulky , spoilt footballer this season			2
already booked , his pointless shove on @entity113 in the second half saw him follow @entity115 down the tunnel and killed any @entity6 prospects of salvaging a draw			1
at least the @entity119 had the self - awareness to apologise later on social media			0
@entity16 is upended by @entity24 's @entity123 international midfielder @entity122 @entity16 lands awkwardly as a foul is given by the @entity32 referee for the foul by @entity127 @entity16 put in a performance at the @entity2 despite his sublime early free - kick to equalise there are mitigating factors to @entity16 's current mood			1
his younger brother died of cancer during the @entity135 and the racial abuse he has received on @entity137 is without doubt disturbing and unpleasant			0
yet in this kind of form he is a liability to his team - mates			0
his lack of positional discipline and desire to track back and defend makes the job for his central midfield partners almost impossible			0
@entity147 was totally over-run in the first half on wednesday night			0
@entity20 may be privately relieved @entity16 is now suspended for the next @entity150 game at home to @entity152			1
we never really got to the bottom of ' @entity155 ' , when @entity16 was allegedly seething that @entity6 's @entity157 owners had n't marked his birthday by baking him a cake			1
the suspicion was he was trying to engineer a move back to @entity162 , when @entity162 failed to show much interest , he pledged his loyalty to @entity6 rather unconvincingly			2
certainly , his influence on matches this season has been far less than in previous years			0
@entity20 has to accept some blame as well			2
given that @entity16 is a bit of a loose cannon in midfield , it seems strange that an experienced coach like himself will regularly leave his team outnumbered in the key central area			2
he let @entity175 and @entity176 , both natural sitting players , leave and wo n't start with @entity115 , who was terrific last season			2
@entity115 , who again did not start for @entity6 , jogs off the pitch after being red - carded on wednesday night the plans against @entity24 were a mess			1
@entity147 was expected to stop @entity99 's counter-attacks almost single - handed while @entity30 , @entity183 and @entity16 ineffectually stood by			1
by the time he sent on @entity115 to rectify it at half - time , the @entity184 was so pumped up , he got a quick yellow card			2
the manager then gambled by taking @entity147 off for @entity189 with @entity6 behind , leaving @entity115 as the only natural holder – and then he got sent off			1
incidentally , the @entity184 also apologised for his red			0
if @entity20 is at fault tactically , the owners ca n't avoid some degree of responsibility			0
their historic breaking of the @entity198 regulations means the manager has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the @entity8 this season			0
strikers @entity204 and @entity205 have been loaned out because there is no room for them , leaving @entity20 having to chase four trophies with just three strikers			0
@entity204 left @entity6 to join @entity211 on loan for the season in august but was not replaced @entity205 was allowed to join @entity213 on loan and has been prolific north of the border @entity20 has plenty of questions to answer after @entity6 remained winless in @entity47 this season @entity218 defends @entity6 's discipline he has said that @entity220 and @entity221 were never options because @entity6 could n't afford their transfer fees or wages under the @entity198 restrictions			1
on the bright side , @entity6 have been here before – in both title - winning seasons under @entity229 and @entity20 , they were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed , and came out on top			1
@entity152 's dominance of their @entity8 group means the second spot is still up for grabs			0
a victory against the @entity240 champions , who have already qualified , will set up a likely winner - takes - all meeting away to @entity56			0
difficult , but not impossible for a team who have @entity25 and @entity246 on their books			0
the continuing presence of @entity25 at the @entity2 is a major positive for @entity6 and their fans the truth is that the fault for @entity6 's current problems have to be shared between manager , star players , owners and fans			1
only by rallying together can they turn this around			0
if they each act with the petulance of @entity16 's childish shove , they are in big trouble .			0
