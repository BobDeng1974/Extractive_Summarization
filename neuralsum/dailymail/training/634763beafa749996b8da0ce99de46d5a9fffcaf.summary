when @entity1 chased down @entity3 defender @entity2 , dispossessed him , and crossed for @entity4 to open the scoring in the @entity7 semi-final first - leg two weeks ago , the @entity0 chanted his name			1
it was a strange moment , especially as the goalscorer had been @entity11			0
it seems @entity1 has won over his new supporters almost without scoring goals			1
he turns up in @entity15 for his first game on @entity18 soil since his £ 75million transfer having scored just seven times in all competitions in 22 games , but there is no crisis because supporters have learned to love the new @entity1 – the one who makes their all - star front - three tick			1
‘ we do n’t play the way @entity50 play ; he is not receiving the final pass as often , ’ @entity38 says , justifying the scoring dip since last season			2
‘ but since he arrived he has given us a lot more power up front in games and he opens the space up for other players with his running off the ball			0
’ in his 22 games so far he has clocked - up 12 assists and given @entity4 a presence in attack that has allowed @entity11 in particular to find a little more time and space			2
@entity1 puts his gloves on as he prepares to return to the cold @entity18 weather ahead of tuesday night @entity1 points to where he wants the ball as @entity4 prepare for their @entity69 assault @entity4 face @entity70 outfit @entity35 in the @entity69 on tuesday night @entity1 attempts the spectacular as he prepares to face @entity35 in the @entity69 ‘ it helps that they get on well together off the pitch , ’ said coach @entity71 recently and the mate - sharing sessions with @entity73 have certainly helped his acceptance into the group			1
if the lack of goals have been a surprise perhaps the sacrifice on the pitch should not be			0
for all his flaws @entity1 could never be accused of not being a team player			2
when he turned up at @entity50 in january 2011 he did n’t ask to become the club ’s designated penalty taker as his replacement @entity89 did when he joined this summer			1
and when in january 2013 the club signed @entity91 the potential clash of egos never came to pass because @entity1 happily played wider or deeper to accommodate @entity95 ’ new centre - forward			1
former @entity50 striker @entity1 has given @entity11 license to roam more and play with freedom @entity1 runs with the ball during @entity4 's @entity100 match against @entity101 on saturday @entity1 has proved to be a hit at @entity4 almost without scoring goals as he turns provider in his autobiography @entity105 published last year he admits to feeling selfish at @entity107 only once – during the last game of the season against @entity110 when he felt his team - mates were running the clock down because the title dream had died while he wanted another goal to pip @entity115 to the @entity116			1
‘ when we were winning and players were gesturing for us just to keep the ball , i was saying the opposite			0
i wanted us to attack , to go forward			0
i was shouting , " no , no , attack ! " ' he admits			0
in the end he stayed on 31 goals and shared the prize with the @entity125			0
this season there will be no repeat of that feat. he has only four league goals and trails @entity115 by 25 goals			0
but in his first season at his new club that will not matter			0
what will matter is that he make an impact in his first appearance back on @entity18 soil since that home win over @entity110 on the last day of last season			1
@entity1 ( left ) can often be seen enjoying himself in training with his @entity4 team - mates @entity37 ( left ) and @entity1 share a joke in @entity4 's training session previously after his move @entity1 jokes with his @entity4 team - mates as he gets used to life in @entity147 with the @entity100 giants with the return coming at the @entity150 he will be up against the player who he described as probably his toughest opponent – @entity153			1
‘ we ’d benefited too from @entity153 getting injured and @entity157 going off after picking up a knock ’ he said of that famous win over @entity35 at @entity107 that had @entity50 believing it really was going to be their year			1
‘ @entity159 is probably the hardest defender i faced in the @entity70 – he organises @entity35 , and is one of the best in the world in his position			2
' ‘ we go again ’ was the famous @entity166 war - cry at the end of that @entity50 win over @entity35			1
a slip from @entity159 led to one of the goals			0
now @entity4 must go again after the weekend defeat to @entity101			2
it was the first time they had not won since the opening game of the year when coach @entity71 left @entity11 and @entity37 on the bench for the first half			0
since that 1 - 0 reverse the 11 - game winning run produced 40 goals and 28 of them had come from the boots of the front three			0
only four of those came from @entity1 but the spectacular scissor kick coming off the bench in the 5 - 0 win over @entity188 was perhaps the pick of the bunch			2
@entity1 ( right ) is preparing for his first game back on @entity18 soil following his £ 75m move to @entity4 @entity1 laughs with his @entity4 team - mates at a recent presentation for @entity4 's new sponsors @entity1 is fitting in well with his team - mates in @entity4 following his exit from @entity4 at the weekend triumphant @entity101 coach @entity198 mimicked @entity1 's goal celebration in his press conference kissing three of his fingers for the three points his team had just picked up			1
‘ what a time to have a siesta ? ’ asked the @entity206 press			0
tuesday night ’s game represents a chance for them to get back in the winning routine immediately , and will give @entity1 a chance to get back in the scoring habit			1
what he can be sure of however is that if he does n’t find the back of the net but he does manage to find @entity37 and @entity11 , and they do , then no one will be complaining .			0

@entity1 joined @entity4 from @entity50 in a £ 75million switch in 2014
@entity1 is in @entity15 for his first game on @entity18 soil since the move
the striker has been fitting in well at the @entity0 and is a *fan* favourite
