by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 , 20 , always felt as though he was trapped in the wrong body			0
making the brave decision to live as a woman @entity5 has had to endure taunts , stalkers and even death threats			1
after doing a modelling shoot with a friend , @entity5 , from @entity11 , found it boosted her confidence and feeling of femininity hugely and that it also offered her a platform to champion the rights of transgendered people			1
@entity5 only began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her even as a child ( left ) @entity5 felt she was trapped in a male body , and by age 14 ( right ) was experimenting with make - up and dressing as a woman ' ever since i was young i wanted to dress up in girls ' clothes and i remember aged three my favourite toy was a @entity32 doll			1
by the time i was 14 i was experimenting with new looks and ways i could look like a girl so that i could be myself and not be judged for being trans. ‘ i went to a celeb lookalike party as a woman and everyone said how great i looked and from then on i decided i wanted to be a woman when i was older			1
‘ at the age of 15 i told my mum that i wanted to be a female			2
she was supportive but apprehensive and scared for me as i made the decision at such a young age			2
' we agreed to wait until i was older before i made any changes or started taking hormones and looking into surgery , but by the age 17 i could n't wait any longer			1
' @entity5 has faced stalking , abuse and even death threats for being transgender ‘ i felt like a woman , i dressed like a woman , and deep down i knew i was always meant to be a woman			1
i started to dress like a girl and went to the doctors to speak about hormones and how to get the ball rolling			2
my friends and family were supportive but it ’s not been easy			0
‘ i 've had stalkers and death threats , even hate crimes but the worst of these ones were settled in court			0
‘ i have n't undergone any surgery yet but have been taking steroids for over a year now and i love the way i look			0
‘ i may consider surgery in the future but at the moment nobody thinks i ’m a man so i may stay natural			0
@entity5 began modelling six months ago when a friend asked her to pose in a shoot for her			1
‘ it was amazing , i felt empowered , sexy			0
it was the most like a woman i 'd ever felt			0
‘ a photographer from @entity81 asked if he could shoot me and i said yes , to this day i think he thinks i ’m a girl			0
well , i am … but you know what i mean ! ! ‘ since then i ’ve done more and more shoots and it ’s my mission to become the first ever published @entity88 glamour model			1
‘ being trans gives you a larger sense of achievement when you do things like this as its proving everyone wrong , it ’s been so hard over the years and all the changes i ’ve gone through both mentally and physically but i look in the mirror and it ’s all been worth it			0
@entity5 says in front of a camera is where she feels her most confident and sexy ‘ i look the best i ’ve ever looked and all my friends and family are behind me so i ’m going to do this			2
i wo n’t stop until @entity88 is fully accepted in our culture today - it ’s my mission and i will make it happen ! ‘ i ’d love to help any other confused girls and boys out there who are trans and scared to be themselves			1
nobody should be ashamed to be who they want to be			0
