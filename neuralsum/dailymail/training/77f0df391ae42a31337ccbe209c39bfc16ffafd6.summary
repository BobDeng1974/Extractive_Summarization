this theory has been looked at especially as @entity34 have refused to release details about his work			1
details of the killing , which took place at about 10pm on october 14 , were until now shrouded in secrecy because police imposed a news blackout			1
one theory being considered by @entity18 police is that mr @entity10 was deliberately targeted because of his work at oil giant @entity34			1
a source close to the investigation said the ruthless efficiency of the attack bore all the hallmarks of a professional hit by @entity62 or @entity9 assassins			0
‘ we are looking into his work dealings to see if he had any enemies or was working on anything sensitive , ’ the source said			2

four bullet casings were later found in the road			0
one local , who asked not to be identified , said he heard a ‘ @entity104 , tac ’ noise and went out to investigate			0
he said : ‘ i saw a woman lying on the pavement across the street			0
she was shouting , “ help , help ! ”			0
there was also a man lying next to a car			2
