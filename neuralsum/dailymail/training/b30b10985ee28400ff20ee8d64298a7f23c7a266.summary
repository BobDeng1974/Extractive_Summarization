by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 5 april 2013 @entity1 has unveiled a new app to turn any phone running @entity6 's @entity5 software into a ' @entity1 phone '			1
the free software can be downloaded to handsets and take over its homescreen and menu system to show updates without having to launch a @entity1 app. it will also be preloaded on new handsets , including a @entity17 handset called @entity18 which will be the first ' @entity1 phone ' , and goes on sale on april 12th , when the free app will also launch			1
users can chat and see emails ( left ) and also easily post pictures via @entity36 and comment without having to load a @entity1 app. ' today we 're finally here to talk about the @entity1 phone , ' said @entity23 at the announcement at the firm 's @entity42			1
' or more accurately , we are going to talk about how you can turn your @entity5 phone into a great social phone			2
' ' we are not building a phone and we are not building an operating system but we are are building something that is a whole lot deeper than an ordinary app. ' we wanted to flip things around so our phones were designed around people and not apps			1
' how many times have you pulled out a phone and looked into different apps to see what 's going on			1
' we want to bring all this content to the front			0
' @entity23 says users can have an experience on @entity5 phones that they ca n't have on other platforms			1
' we 're really proud of @entity30 , we think this is the best version of @entity1 there is			1
' ' home ' comes amid rapid growth in the number of people who access @entity1 from phones and tablet computers			2
of its 1.06billion monthly users , 680million log in to @entity1 using a mobile gadget			2
the new product is a family of apps designed around people 's @entity1 connections			2
pictures from your @entity1 news feed would take up the entire display screen			0
@entity23 said users will be seeing the world through people rather than apps			2
he gave an example of standing in line at a shop and looking down at the phone to see photos of friends and family			1
the new app completely overhauls @entity1 's chat system , left , while a new lockscreen , right , completely replaces the normal @entity5 menu system			1
the @entity17 first will be the first handset to launch with @entity1 's software preloaded on it ' it 'll be possible to flip through the items			1
' if there 's something you like , just double tap on it to " like " it , ' he said			2
the home app also includes a radical overhaul of the firm 's chat app designed to take on increasing competition from apps such as @entity119			1
the new ' @entity126 ' show a friend 's head in the corner of the screen whenever a new message appears			1
' they 're a way you can chat to your friends no matter what you 're doing , ' said @entity1 's @entity132			1
the new app will be available on all recent @entity5 devices , including tablets , the firm said			1
the software replaces the normal phone menu with a version designed by @entity1 the new @entity1 homescreen , which lets users access @entity1 , chat with friends or access their apps experts said the move was an interesting one - but warn it could simply be a way to show users more ads.			1
@entity148 , chief telecoms analyst at @entity149 , said : ' any broadening of @entity1 's appeal on mobile devices would have to be broad - based , and the @entity5 launcher approach allows it to target a huge installed base of hundreds of millions of @entity5 users , which will be a large chunk of @entity1 's total user base of more than a billion people			1
' to users , the sell here will be making it easier to share information , photos and so on with friends			2
' but to @entity1 , this is about becoming more deeply embedded in the operating system on mobile devices , and creating a broader platform			0
' since @entity1 does n't make an operating system for mobile devices , this is the next best thing			0
it will allow @entity1 to track more of a user 's behaviour on devices , and present more opportunities to serve up advertising , which is @entity1 's main business model			0
' and that presents the biggest obstacle to success for this experiment : @entity1 's objectives and users are once again in conflict			2
' users do n't want more advertising or tracking , and @entity1 wants to do more of both			0
' the new @entity1 ' home ' app , which turns @entity5 handsets into a @entity1 phone ' what @entity1 wants is to put itself at the front of the @entity5 user experience for as many @entity1 users as possible and make @entity1 more elemental to their customers ' experience , ' said @entity202 analyst @entity201			2
the new home service wo n't be available on @entity207 's @entity205 and @entity206 devices			0
@entity207 's @entity209 and @entity210 operating systems include features that integrate @entity1 's services , but @entity23 says doing something like @entity30 would require a closer partnership			1
@entity207 had no immediate comment			0
the deeper mobile integration will likely help @entity1 to attract more mobile advertisers			0
though mobile ads were a big concern for @entity1 's investors even before the company 's initial public offering last may , some of the worry has subsided as the company muscles its way into the market			0
last year , @entity1 began showing ads to its mobile audience by shoehorning corporate - sponsored content into users ' news feeds , which also include updates from friends and brands they follow			1
@entity1 now faces the challenge of showing people mobile ads without annoying or alienating them			0
the mobile advertising market is growing quickly , thanks in large part to @entity1 and @entity244 , which also entered the space in 2012			0
research firm @entity246 expects @entity248 mobile ad spending to grow 77 per cent this year to $ 7.29billion , from $ 4.11billion last year			0
@entity246 said wednesday that it expects @entity1 to reap $ 965million in @entity248 mobile ad revenue in 2013			0
that 's about 2.5 times the $ 391million in 2012 , the first year that @entity1 started showing mobile ads. @entity252 , vice president at @entity246 , says : ' there are some clear reasons why a deeper integration with mobile operating systems and handsets make sense for @entity1			0
' at the end of the day , the more deeply @entity1 can engage consumers , no matter what device or operating system or handset , ' the better			0
@entity1 's stock rose 80 cents , or 3.1 per cent , to $ 27.05 in afternoon trading following the announcement			0
it is still 23 per cent below its initial public offering price of $ 35 .			0

@entity30 takes over phone 's homescreen and menus
lets users see updates and chat with friends from anywhere in their phone
firm is also working with phone makers including @entity17 to load the software on new phones
*critics* say new system is simply a way to show users more adverts
