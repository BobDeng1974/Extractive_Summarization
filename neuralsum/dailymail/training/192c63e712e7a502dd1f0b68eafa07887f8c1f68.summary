by @entity0 published : 20:48 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 03:43 est , 19 november 2013 a new blood test for prostate cancer could spare thousands of men unnecessary treatment			1
the test , which could cost less than £ 2 , could distinguish between cancers that are life - threatening and those which are comparatively harmless			2
although prostate cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in men , with around 41,000 new cases and 10,700 deaths each year , many sufferers do not need treatment			1
breakthrough : a single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed			1
scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease three quarters of them have slow - growing tumours that need nothing more than to be monitored			1
but until now there have been no reliable tests to distinguish between harmless cancers and the deadly aggressive varieties			1
tens of thousands of men undergo surgery , chemotherapy or radiotherapy simply as a precaution – which often leaves them incontinent and their sexual desire severely impaired			2
the new blood test developed by scientists at @entity46 assesses the level of the protein @entity48 , which is very high in men with aggressive cancers and causes prostate cancer cells to spread to other organs			1
@entity54 published in the journal @entity56 found that the protein test could correctly distinguish the aggressive tumours			1
the scientists hope that the test will be available on the @entity60 in the next five to ten years			2
clinical trials will begin next year			2
dr @entity62 , lead author of the study , said : ‘ at the moment , men with prostate cancer have a lot of very difficult decisions to make based on not very much evidence			0
‘ this test would run on technology which is already routinely used in the @entity60			0
it would cost a couple of pounds , maximum			0
’ referring to her research , she said : ‘ this is an important step along the path to developing a much - sought - after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer			0
’ at present , men are given the prostate - specific antigen ( @entity81 ) test			0
it measures levels of a different type of protein , which are normally raised if a tumour is present			1
specialists also look at the cells under x-ray to try to determine how quickly they are growing – but experts say both methods are inadequate			0
with the new test , much higher levels of the protein , @entity48 , were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue dr @entity99 , director of research at @entity100 , said : ‘ being able to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancers could transform the outlook for the 40,000 men who are faced with a diagnosis of the disease every year			1
‘ the current diagnostic process is at best inadequate			0
‘ all too often men are faced with the difficult decision of whether to endure life - changing side effects from treatment for cancers which may never have caused them any harm			1
others , however , are left with more aggressive cancers that are untreated until it ’s too late			1
‘ if we are to save more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year , this urgently needs to be addressed			0
’ professor @entity122 , @entity124 ’s prostate cancer expert , who is based at the @entity126 , said : ‘ as a prostate cancer clinician , i have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease			2
‘ i hope that this research brings forward the day when i can say to patients , “ we know that your cancer does n’t need treatment ” – a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects			1
‘ this extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening , and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future			0
’ n the number of children beating cancer has risen to more than eight in ten , according to figures from @entity124			0
in the 1960s , only three in ten survived after diagnosis , said a spokesman for the charity			0
survival rates for liver and bone tumours have made ‘ particularly good progress ’ , with five - year survival rates increasing from 67 to 82 per cent for liver tumours and 61 to 68 per cent for bone cancer			2
but he warned there is ‘ still some way to go ’ with other forms of the disease .			0

there are higher levels of the protein @entity48 in aggressive tumours
*doctors* can identify tumours that are likely to pose a deadly threat
currently the *aggressiveness* of a tumour can only be *loosely* identified
this means some patients have *debilitating* treatment that is not necessary
