by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have clarified their position regarding ‘ cooling breaks ’ at the @entity5			0
it was expected that such intervals would occur during every game of the tournament but @entity2 said on friday that breaks would only be allowed when temperatures exceeded @entity12			2
that means @entity14 and @entity15 are likely to miss out on such refreshment in @entity17 on saturday night with temperatures forecast for @entity19			1
humidity is expected to reach 89 per cent and it promises to be an energy - sapping environment for the @entity22			1
that 's cool : @entity24 is sprayed by a member of @entity14 's coaching staff during a training session in @entity28 hostile : temperatures could top @entity19 and humidity 88 per cent when @entity14 face @entity15 but a @entity2 statement read : ‘ official and mandatory cooling breaks have not been established for the 64 games of the @entity5 , but instead they will be considered on a match - by - match basis			1
‘ climate conditions will be evaluated and should the temperature exceed 32 degrees , then the @entity35 will recommend cooling breaks to the @entity2 general coordinator and match commissioner			0
the implementation of the cooling breaks will reside with the referee			0
‘ cooling breaks last three minutes in duration are then implemented by the referee at approximately 30 minutes into the run - of - play in both halves of the match ( i.e. around the 30th minute and 75th minute respectively )			2
three minutes will then be added to stoppage time at the end of each half			0

temperatures in @entity17 set to reach @entity19 and humidity 89 per cent
three - minute breaks are at referee 's *discretion* but only once temperatures exceed @entity60
