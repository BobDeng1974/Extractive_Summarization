mps condemned the commission , which now faces a fresh investigation by @entity3 published : 19:07 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 4 june 2013 the @entity4 was granted charitable status - a move approved by the regulator 's controversial then - chairman dame @entity7 the @entity9 was accused of ‘ unacceptable ’ and ‘ damaging ’ failures yesterday for allowing a huge tax avoidance scam to masquerade as a children ’s charity			1
the @entity4 was granted charitable status – a move approved by the regulator ’s controversial then - chairman dame @entity7 – despite a lack of checks , mps said			1
its decision was made even though the trust was set up in the @entity23 by a company whose directors were known tax avoidance specialists			1
the affair was the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’ of fake charities exploiting charity tax law , the @entity28 said			2
mps condemned the commission , which now faces a fresh investigation , for ‘ lack of rigour ’ in policing rogue organisations over the past 25 years			1
their report follows a series of political rows over the commission ’s priorities following @entity46 ’s appointment in 2006			1
the 57 - year - old @entity48 member was handed 13 prominent quango jobs after @entity51 ’s 1997 election victory			1
the @entity9 role , which she quit last summer , paid £ 80,000 for a three - day week			2
the @entity4 applied for charitable status in 2009			1
but it was a front for a £ 176million tax avoidance scam which the @entity9 did not begin investigating until a year later			1
the trust spent only £ 55,000 on charitable causes but tried to claim £ 46million in charity tax relief			2
mps said that it was ‘ unacceptable ’ that the @entity4 was ever registered as a charity			1
‘ my committee does not believe the @entity4 ever met the legal criteria to qualify as a registered charity , ’ said committee chairman @entity63			1
‘ its purpose was to avoid @entity71 tax			2
‘ the trust ’s true purpose might have been easily detected by the @entity9 had they carried out more checks before registration , including with @entity76			2
’ the scandal had damaged the reputation of the commission and the charity sector , she said			2
‘ it was only after it had registered the trust as a new charity that the commission found out that it had been set up by people active in tax avoidance schemes			1
the commission has investigated but a year later its findings have not been published			2
’ the @entity9 said last night : ‘ we regularly share information with @entity76			0
we are discussing better ways to work together to tackle abuse of charity			0
‘ we are targeting our resources on the areas of highest risk , with a particular emphasis on tackling fraud , terrorist abuse and risks to vulnerable beneficiaries			0
‘ we have strengthened our board with new members with considerable experience of regulation in such areas			0
’ committee chairman @entity63 said that the committee did noy believe the @entity4 ever met the legal criteria to qualify as a registered charity the @entity4 was launched by tax avoidance expert @entity110 , who in the past has numbered comedian @entity113 , former radio 1 dj @entity114 and @entity116 star @entity115 among the associates of his companies			1
mr @entity110 ’s interests have also included pawnbroking and debt collection agencies , and used car businesses			0
the @entity4 has operated by borrowing large sums from banks and using the money to buy gilts , government bonds which attract no capital gains tax or stamp duty when traded			1
the gilts are then sold to wealthy investors for a tiny token sum			0
the investors sell the gilts on the open market for the proper price			0
they then give the proceeds back to the charity , which takes six per cent in fees			0
the money is used to pay back the @entity4 ’s bank borrowings			1
investors can then claim gift aid , which can amount to between £ 250,000 and £ 375,000 in tax relief for every million ‘ donated ’ to the charity			0
@entity46 , 57 , who was made dame in 2006 , is a @entity48 member who was handed a series of prominent quango jobs after @entity48 ’s 1997 election victory			0
she quit as chairman of the @entity9 last summer			0
the job , which paid £ 80,000 for a three - day week , was one of three quango posts and three posts on committees running state institutions which she held last year			0
she has since 1997 run or been a member of 13 quangos and boards , alongside a post as deputy lieutenant of @entity161			0
her replacement at the @entity9 , @entity163 , has also come under criticism from mps , in particular for the @entity9 ’s decision to ban a @entity168 church from charity status on the grounds that it did not do enough for the public good			2
the @entity9 said yesterday that it has opened an inquiry into an organisation called @entity176			0
the body rented 1,500 empty buildings at peppercorn rents and installed wi - fi transmitters to broadcast public safety messages			0
landlords then claimed they did not need to pay business rates because the buildings were used for charitable purposes			0
three councils who said the charity was a tax avoidance scheme won a @entity191 case allowing them to recover tax last month .			1

@entity4 directors were known tax avoidance specialists
