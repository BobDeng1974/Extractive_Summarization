it had to be him			0
as the clock ticked towards its 92nd minute and with no discernible reason to suggest that @entity4 would come away with anything more than a point against a staunch @entity7 , up popped @entity8			1
right place , right time			2
slammed past @entity10 and there would be no first day slip - ups that have become the norm for @entity14			1
@entity4 won on the opening day for the first time since 2009 and had their fulcrum to thank			1
there is an argument that the last - gasp winner could have fallen to anyone , but it was no mistake that @entity8 took up a clever station , alone at the back post , to plunder home			1
it ’s the seventh game in under a year that goals from the @entity27 have won the @entity28 a game			1
from central midfield , that ’s some record			0
make no mistake , this was not vintage @entity8			2
he - much like the rest of @entity4 ’s midfield - was guilty of giving the ball away needlessly against @entity7 and actually struggled to impose himself on the game , saying as much afterwards			1
but what sets him apart , even when he ’s not at the races , is that prowess in front of goal			0
sixteen last year - even after four months out injured - along with two already this			0
there is even a tinge of @entity78 about the way in which he comes alive on the edge coupled with that drive to go and join in with the lone front man			0
the common conception is that if @entity8 stays fit , @entity4 may just upset those at the @entity85 and @entity86 come may			1
and it ’s difficult to argue			0
here is a man who can drag this side through games , take control of the tightest of battles and is the club ’s heartbeat			2
his stock continues to rise after each 90 minutes			0
in the current financial climate , the figures @entity4 could demand are astronomical			2
how much is he now worth ? £ 40million , @entity100 mused on saturday night ? potentially more			0
trophy at last : @entity8 sealed @entity4 's @entity102 win against @entity49 in a sparkling breakthrough season no stopping him : he also popped up with the winner against @entity50 in the @entity105 last year @entity106 for silverware : @entity8 lead the @entity28 to the @entity102 , can he do the same with the @entity48 there is no chance he ’ll be leaving the @entity110 any time soon , though			1
this has been the first summer for a long time whereby @entity14 has n’t lost top players - the ailing @entity116 and @entity117 are n’t in the same league as others who previously departed - and there is n’t that pressure to cash in any longer			1
@entity8 has proven he is the player to build a new team around , and that ’s what the manager has begun to do			2
signing @entity128 last year and @entity129 this shows the type of intent that has been severely lacking over the last decade			2
but what ’s more , from @entity8 ’s point of view at least , he now has colleagues of a similar classy ilk			0
while the @entity137 was another to disappoint on home debut , it ’s plain to see that his movement off the ball is something the chief playmaker will relish			0
and @entity4 will need @entity8 ’s invention mixed with runners in between the lines if they are to win enough games to launch a title charge , @entity7 - actually buoyed by the bizarre circumstances to have engulfed the club ’s @entity48 preparations over the last few days - demonstrated that they are a tricky customer to break down ; the hosts offered very little , but still found a way of picking up three points			1
happy to have him : @entity14 's side were in a spot of bother before @entity8 came to the party shut out : @entity129 struggled to make an impact for @entity4 on his @entity48 debut star : meanwhile , @entity8 is one of @entity163 's premier midfielders who can galvanise the @entity28 there had been hallmarks of the dithering performance against @entity167 on this weekend last year , when they were beaten to a chorus of boos			1
@entity8 and co found a way , just , and it ’s something they will have to keep up			0
last season ’s draws against @entity51 , @entity176 and @entity177 must be converted , defeat at @entity174 reversed			0
@entity14 is close to assembling a squad ready to win this division again , and in @entity8 has one of @entity163 ’s premier midfielders to galvanise a group in need of a leader .			1

@entity8 scored the winner for @entity4 in added time against @entity7
the midfielder now has five goals in his last six games
@entity27 has a habit of popping up in the right place at the right time
the @entity28 won their @entity48 opener 2 - 1 at the @entity110
@entity198 opened the scoring before @entity200 *equalised*
@entity129 struggled on debut , but @entity8 came to the fore
he can lead @entity14 's side to the @entity48 title
