@entity4 , of @entity14 in @entity15 , was convicted of 23 charges of domestic abuse and one breach of the peace last month after a two - week trial			1
the 71 - year - old , who clung to his @entity23 seat for 16 days after the verdict , returned to @entity26 sheriff court today where he was sentenced by sheriff @entity27			1
sheriff @entity27 found @entity4 guilty of assaulting his first wife @entity29 on three separate occasions in the 1960s and 1980s			1
on one occasion he assaulted her two weeks before their wedding in january 1967 punching her in the face and leaving her with a black eye			0
ms @entity29 told the court she even had to buy concealer to hide the bruises from their family and friends on the couple ’s wedding day			0
@entity4 was also convicted of assaulting his second wife , @entity44 , 15 times between 1978 and 1984			1
the court heard that on various occasions mrs @entity44 was punched , slapped , kicked and pushed to the ground			0
in an astonishing catalogue of abuse @entity4 spat on her face , threw household items at her , threatened to pour hot coffee over her and pulled her hair			1
he also breached the peace by leaping into mrs @entity44 ’s home brandishing an air rifle after she went out for a birthday meal with another man			0
@entity4 was also found guilty of assaulting and injuring mrs @entity44 ’s 16 - year - old daughter , @entity61 , by repeatedly striking her on the head with a saucepan in 1978 until she was left mrs @entity44 told the court : ' he turned on her and whacked her repeatedly over the head with a yellow saucepan that was so badly broken up it was put in the bin			1
' he battered her so hard she was down on the floor			0
her head was bleeding and she was bruised			0
' the disgraced politician was found guilty of four assaults on his third wife @entity72 , three of which involved slapping or punching her on the face			0
the attacks on her happened between june 1988 and january 1995			0
she told the court her husband also recorded her phone calls and made her sign an agreement to do all household chores in their home			0
@entity4 ’s crimes were committed at addresses in @entity26 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity14 between 1967 and 1995			1
@entity72 told the court she spoke to journalists about her ex-husband after she felt ' mad ' to hear that he was supporting a women ’s aid project for victims of domestic abuse			2
the former @entity95 , who was suspended and later expelled from the party after the allegations surfaced in the @entity100 newspaper in march last year , denied all the charges			1
remarkably he maintained that he had acted in self - defence in relation to all three of them			1
giving evidence , @entity4 claimed he was the victim of ' smearing ' and that his ex-wives colluded to accuse him of domestic violence			2
bullying : @entity4 with former wife @entity44 , the court found him guilty of assaulting her 15 times between 1978 and 1984 , @entity4 claimed he acted in self - defence but sheriff @entity27 said @entity4 was not a credible witness and the evidence shows he was ' controlling , domineering , demeaning and belittling ' towards all his former wives			1
she told him : ' your incredulity at being convicted of these offences and your perceived victimisation are further indications of your abdication of responsibility for your behaviour			2
' you have shown what can only be described as contempt for your former wives and your step daughter in the derogatory manner in which you refer to them			0
' i formed the opinion that you have no understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on victims or children			2
' i have been unable to detect , either during the trial or in the reports , any evidence of remorse for anything or anyone except yourself			0
' she added that given his ' extreme denial ' of his behaviour , it was unrealistic to expect @entity4 to engage fully with any non-custodial domestic abuse programme			1
sheriff @entity27 also said it was clear from their evidence that to @entity4 ’s former wives , his behaviour remained ' vivid and distressing			1
' she added : ' having regard to the gravity of these offences as a result of the cumulative effect of them , your extreme denial and complete absence of any remorse , and the assessment of risk , i have come to the conclusion that a custodial sentence is the only appropriate disposal			0
mrs @entity44 was kicked , punched , slapped and pushed to the ground by her former husband who also once confronted her with an air rifle and viciously her daughter with a saucepan ' in my opinion , the repeated abuse and violent behaviour towards your three former wives and stepdaughter over a period of 28 years outweighs other factors			2
' she added : ' i formed the impression that in the few incidents where you acknowledged the use of physical force , you believed you were entitled to or justified in its use , and certainly have made no apology for it			0
' your denial appears to me to be absolute			0
there is no acknowledgement of any unacceptable behaviour , there is no indication of any motivation to change			2
' the conclusion that there ’s a significant scope to work with you to address your entrenched attitudes , value and beliefs surrounding domestic abuse is flawed			0
” @entity4 initially refused to vacate his @entity209 seat after the verdict , despite pressure from campaigners and other @entity213 , the vast majority of whom signed a motion calling for him to step down			1
he faced having his salary cut by 90 % if jailed , after the parliament ’s corporate body recommended the move for @entity213 who go to prison			0
the politician finally resigned on september 7 , blaming a ' media onslaught ' that made it impossible for him to continue			1
@entity4 was elected to the @entity209 in a surprise victory for the @entity95 two years ago			2
the by - election to fill his @entity23 seat will be held on thursday october 24 .			2

@entity4 , 71 , has been jailed for a year for a catalogue of abuse doled out over four decades
@entity230 described his behaviour towards all three women as ' controlling , domineering , demeaning and belittling '
remarkably he maintained that he had acted in self - defence in relation to all three of them and accused them of colluding against them
