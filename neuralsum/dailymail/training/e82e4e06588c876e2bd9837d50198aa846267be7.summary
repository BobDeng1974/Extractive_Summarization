@entity6 's minute - by - coverage of @entity2 's clash against @entity3 as @entity5 's side looked for their first win from the @entity10 internationals			1
host commentator it may have looked close , but @entity2 were a long way behind @entity3 today			1
the winless run is now up to 12 games against the @entity3 , and surely @entity5 needs to change things against @entity17 next week			1
80mins : it nearly gets worse for @entity3 , but @entity19 knocks the ball on before celebrating scoring			2
78mins : just like last week against @entity23 , it seems as though @entity2 are going to be beaten by the clock			1
seconds remain , as @entity26 goes over in the corner - but @entity28 misses the tricky conversion			2
76mins : and that , should be that			0
the visitors build some pressure in @entity2 's half and the ball is placed back for @entity35 , who has kicked well all day , to send home a drop goal			1
@entity2 have been galvanised by their replacement half - backs			1
@entity39 has added tempo and energy behind the pack and @entity28 has already shown his willingness to take the ball to the line and challenge the opposition at close quarters			0
as a result , @entity2 have started finding spaces and they have reignited the crowd			2
a grandstand finish is in prospect			0
71mins : sin - bin is over ! can @entity2 fight back and score that crucial try ? 67mins : perfect restart from @entity2 and 21 - year - old @entity28 sends the ball over the posts			1
66mins : now @entity2 could be in trouble			2
@entity3 opt for the three points instead of kicking for the corner and @entity35 holds his nerve			2
significant changes - interesting with @entity64 now - must play territory , the chance of winning is through driving play			2
64mins : @entity28 and @entity39 on , @entity68 and @entity67 off			2
61mins : now it 's @entity2 's turn to readjust after a dismissal			1
@entity73 is off for stamping on an opponent , the referee saw it , but went to the @entity76 to check if it was worse than he thought			0
it was , and the hosts are a man down			0
60mins : with @entity81 back on , @entity2 are struggling to penetrate this backline again			1
@entity83 and @entity68 have struggled today , is it time for @entity85 and @entity64 from the bench ? one of the reasons why @entity2 lost to @entity23 last week was because they failed to capitalise on having a numerical advantage when @entity89 was sin - binned in the second half			1
this time , with @entity92 in the sin - bin , the hosts seized their chance in style by scoring two tries from outstanding rolling mauls , but @entity99 's riposte in similar fashion at the other end has put the @entity3 back in the box - seat			1
54mins : they 're a man down but now it 's @entity3 's turn to overpower the hosts ! they work a line - out towards the corner and @entity99 ca n't be stopped			1
really heavy blows being landed , this is an incredible start to the second - half			1
49mins : i said it was all over ... what do i know ! @entity117 's me have really taken advantage of their , er , man advantage , and go straight through the middle yet again			0
@entity122 surges through , and three @entity124 defenders ca n't stop him powering over the line			2
game on , and the hosts want more ! 45mins : maybe this is n't over ! immediately after @entity81 's dismissal @entity117 piles the pressure on the @entity124 pack , and prop @entity132 eventually goes over			1
it ended up being about nine against six there , and the crowd are back up for this one			0
44mins : @entity81 collapses the scrum ... and we all know the referee had warned him ! 41mins : wow			0
43 seconds into the second - half and @entity3 may have wrapped this game up ... a beautiful kick from @entity35 opens up a two - on - one situation and @entity144 eventually goes over for his first international try			1
perfect exection , but what about the @entity2 defence ? huge mountain to climb now			2
can @entity2 regroup , and mount a comeback here ? it could have been worse after those opening ten minutes , but ultimately a disappointing half for @entity2			1
too many unforced errors , including one that lead to the only try , have cost them and @entity5 's side have been unable to put the visitors under any sustained pressure			2
the kicking game is off once again , the handling has been poor , while the decision making has prevented the few points on offer from being scored			0
35mins : @entity2 win the penalty after @entity166 's attacking tap and run			1
not many chances so far but enough errors from either defence to see some points being scored			0
handling errors just killing @entity2 so far - we have territory but again some attacking kicks needed to turn this defence			1
32mins : both sides are warned by the referee that any more collapsing of the maul could result in further action , @entity175 the latest culprit and @entity35 makes no mistake			0
@entity183 : @entity184 has told the captains that there is a ' line in the sand ' and the next offender will be sin - binned			1
27mins : much better spell from @entity2 , but there was a chance for more points			2
@entity194 exploited a hole in defence and were he to unleash @entity83 , there was a try on offer in the corner			2
instead he kept possession and the winger had to stop his run			0
in the end , @entity3 are penalised for not releasing and @entity68 gets @entity2 on their way			1
22mins : @entity175 charges down a kick in @entity3 's 22 but the visitors are cool and kick the pool downfield despite the pressure			1
need some points on the board			0
20mins : @entity211 surges through the defence to try and make things happen			0
but unforced errors mean @entity2 ca n't build up any sustained pressure			0
@entity183 : @entity2 have dominated territory and possession so far in this game , using their rolling maul to good effect , but now they are in early crisis mode			1
the home side really need the next score or the pressure levels could engulf them			0
@entity5 will want to see his pack continue to use their driving game and harness @entity166 's improved carrying			0
the irony is that they were calmly and patiently building a promising attack before @entity67 's intercepted pass gifted a try to the @entity3			1
so many unforced errors - four in a row from @entity234 - and it 's costing us			0
how good are our basic skills ? 1 - 15 poor kicking game so far , and it 's wet			0
we have to turn them			0
oh dear , oh dear			0
@entity2 finally get their hands back on the ball again , but @entity67 's pass is intercepted by @entity243			1
the centre has the whole pitch to run but is virtually unopposed ; an easy try and an extremely sloppy start from @entity2			1
it 's converted from in front of the posts			0
@entity68 will be mighty relieved that his ill - advised attempt to run the ball out of his 22 only ultimately resulted in a penalty to @entity3 , rather than a try			1
he tried to release @entity83 despite @entity2 being vastly out - numbered deep in their own territory and given the difficult handling conditions , he should have realised that it was a dangerous gamble			1
@entity3 so nearly scored a try from turn - over ball - @entity23 would have done			1
10mins : all that early pressure but a mistake has surely gifted @entity3 the first points			1
@entity68 is back under his own posts to collect and could have cleared , but instead plays an inside pass to @entity83 despite the presence of two opposing defenders			2
it 's turned over , and in fact @entity268 nearly goes over in the corner before it 's dropped			2
they 'll take the three			0
7mins : plenty of early territory for @entity2			2
@entity276 tries his hand at storming through the defence with his pace but fumbles			0
rain definitely a factor here , several knock - ons so far			0
4mins : @entity2 deliver their own big hitting and earn themselves a penalty in their own half			2
in for some game looking at the two packs so far			0
no doubt that @entity2 are in an emotionally - charged state going into this game , judging by the sight of @entity166 in tears during the national anthem			2
the @entity292 knows he needs to deliver a big performance today and he is not the only home player under pressure to deliver			0
2mins : first penalty of the game and it goes @entity3 's way , near their own 22			1
tough tackling from the visitors and @entity2 were struggling with their hands there , perhaps because of this wet weather			2
eight years on from that last win , this is a huge chance for @entity2 to finally get one over the @entity124			0
we 're underway with @entity68 kicking off ! @entity67 leads his team out at @entity307 on his 50th cap			1
decent tache for @entity310 , too			0
not long now ! @entity183 : barometer readings at @entity307 are destined to soar off the scale today , as @entity2 attempt to cope with stifling , intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous @entity124 juggernaut			1
national coach @entity5 , his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their @entity322 autumn test series			0
saturday ’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss			0
a fifth successive defeat would leave @entity2 in freefall , just when they need to be building towards next year ’s @entity328			0
sir @entity330 , speaking on @entity329 , says @entity2 ' have to win ... so will win			0
' one thing 's for sure , the kicking game will have to improve			0
and can @entity333 build on his performance last weekend ? @entity276 against @entity335 , @entity83 vs @entity268 ... how do the two teams match - up ? the players have arrived , the fans are in good spirit , the stage is set at @entity307			1
with 13 games until the @entity328 ( can you believe that ? ) this @entity10 international is crucial for both @entity2 and @entity3			1
who will come out on top after last week 's defeats ?			0
