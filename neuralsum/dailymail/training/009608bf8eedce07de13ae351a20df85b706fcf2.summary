yesterday , in a @entity1 ’s in @entity2 , i saw people paying nearly £ 8 for a @entity4 and fries			1
for anyone unfamiliar with their prices , that ’s more than double the cost of the same meal in the @entity12 : £ 3.88			1
the ten - minute taxi ride to get from my hotel – £ 123 for b&b in a chain establishment – to the fast food restaurant was £ 25			2
like thousands of @entity12 holidaymakers here for a skiing break , the crippling prices mean that for every second i ’m here , my bank balance is falling as fast as the snow around me			1
but last week , for complex reasons , the government ’s bankers unhinged their @entity2 franc from the euro			1
instantly , the franc took off like a hot air balloon			1
now it ’s the only point of conversation			0
one young @entity35 couple spoke with amazement at paying the equivalent of £ 68.70 for two posh burgers and beers			2
@entity12 dental surgeon @entity40 was sipping a £ 15 @entity42 cocktail in a ski bar in @entity44 in the early hours of yesterday morning			1
three days earlier , it would have cost £ 12			2
‘ our trip was costing at one stage 30 per cent more			2
when news broke about the franc , i was watching this weekend ’s trip getting more expensive by the minute			2
’ mr @entity40 , 43 , and his wife @entity59 travelled from their home in @entity62 for an annual january skiing break with five friends			0
the group had just spent £ 700 on a sushi meal at the @entity67 that would have cost £ 579 before the central bank ’s intervention			2
@entity71 is now in real peril			0
the decision to stop pegging the franc to the euro will cause economic difficulties in @entity2			1
so why on earth did these safety - first , boring @entity2 bankers decide to break away and cause such convulsions to the currency markets last week ? the answer is that , however bad it might be for the @entity2 , it ’s a nightmare for the euro			1
and it is precisely because of the euro ’s perilous weakness that these seismic events are happening			2
in many ways the situation here is a mirror image of what happened with @entity12 ’s @entity96 fiasco in 1992 , when we stopped locking the pound to a basket of @entity101 currencies			0
the @entity2 have spent the past three years trying desperately to stop a tide of money pouring into the country , mostly from investors desperate to avoid or ditch the euro : the influx was causing the franc to inflate and make their famous exports – chocolates , watches , pharmaceuticals – too expensive , especially for the @entity115 market that accounts for half of @entity2 ’s trade			1
they even began charging negative interest in their world famous banks – effectively upending the basic rule of banking by forcing depositors to pay – but still the cash flowed in			0
finally , last week , rumours swept the money markets that the @entity129 was about to print more money – so - called quantitative easing – to bail it out of its latest crisis ; this time , brought on by concerns @entity135 will tumble out of the eurozone after an election later this month			2
the pressures between the strong franc and weak euro became intolerable , and the @entity2 threw in the towel			1
the cap had to be lifted , and the franc instantly jumped 39 per cent against the floundering euro – the biggest single - day move for a rich nation ’s currency in four decades			1
it ended the day ‘ just ’ 17 per cent up in a market that considers a two per cent move dramatic			2
the shocking rises in @entity2 spell disaster from @entity101 's single currency this unleashed what the boss of @entity155 rightly called a ‘ tsunami for the export industry , and for tourism and finally for the entire country ’			1
with the instantly increased price of exports , came fears of job losses			0
but while many @entity2 shares slumped , the bigger problem is faced by the euro			1
it has lost a key pillar of support and , as one @entity62 analyst said so rightly last week , ‘ ca n’t find a friend for love nor money ’			0
even now , after such a long time and damaging episode , the eurozone and its pathetic panjandrums have not resolved the internal contradictions of a costly experiment that has caused economic carnage around the continent			0
now even @entity183 , the @entity182 ’s economic powerhouse , is struggling to bear the cost of this flawed attempt to align diverse economies without resolving core structural issues			0
the timing of the @entity2 shock could not have been worse ( or perhaps more delicious ) – on the eve of this week ’s @entity192 in @entity193 , when business leaders and global dignitaries ( and prince @entity196 ) gather in the glitzy alpine town to debate the state of the world			1
the central bank ’s announcement was called ‘ a bit of a surprise ’ by @entity203 , the head of the @entity204 , who had not been given advance warning			0
this is diplomatic speak for ‘ what the hell ? ’ or worse – especially since three days earlier the bank ’s vice-chairman had insisted the exchange rate cap remained the cornerstone of fiscal policy			0
and in the ski resorts yesterday , it was @entity12 holidaymakers left utterly dismayed as equipment rental and guiding costs rose 20 per cent overnight			1
a week ’s ski pass for a family of four in @entity44 shot up from £ 863 to £ 1,030			1
a beer on their first night cost £ 4.50 but two nights later was £ 5.40			0
shopkeepers across @entity2 are desperately trying to calculate the damage			1
‘ everyone was very startled by events , ’ said @entity227 , manager of a upmarket cigar shop in @entity229			0
‘ we have to see what happens but it is just too expensive for people to come on holiday to @entity2 now			1
’ @entity227 said some 40 per cent of his sales came from @entity101 customers			0
at the start of last week he was selling cigars costing € 8 in @entity183 for the equivalent of € 11 ; now they are € 15			0
meanwhile , a @entity183 border town was flooded with @entity2 people stocking up on cheaper clothes , electronics and food			1
happily , in the rest of @entity101 , there is good news for us @entity12 : the euro has slumped against sterling to the most attractive rate since july 2008			0
and even here in @entity2 , there was one party of holidaying @entity12 left content amid the crisis last week			1
@entity259 , owner of an internet hosting business , was in @entity44 with friends when they went to withdraw cash from an atm			0
as they did so , they realised the rate had not been changed , so kept pulling out more and more money until the machine was empty			0
‘ sometimes the @entity2 are n’t quite as organised as some may believe , ’ he said happily			2
there are always winners alongside losers in these situations			0
but this was just small change for a nation that has already blown so much money trying to insulate itself from the crushing euro catastrophe .			0

@entity2 government banker 's unhinged their franc from euro last week
instantly franc took off and saw prices rising to crippling levels
ski rental prices rose by 20 per cent and a ski pass went up by £ *167*
not pegging the franc to euro will cause economic difficulty in @entity2
the decision is a nightmare for the perilously weak euro
