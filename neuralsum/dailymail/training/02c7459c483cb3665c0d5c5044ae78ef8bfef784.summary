there have been times in the past five years , particularly on tuesdays and wednesdays , when turning on the tv pushed @entity3 to the limit			1
@entity6 ’s captain is a football fanatic who never misses a chance to sit down at home and watch a game			1
but , at various points since december 9 , 2009 — the date his club relinquished a place among @entity16 ’s elite — @entity3 has found viewing the @entity18 almost intolerable			1
‘ when you are n’t involved , there is a big jealousy , ’ @entity3 admits			1
‘ i was jealous of the teams and players who were involved when @entity6 had nothing to do it with it			1
but that ’s a good thing , is n’t it ? it ’s the best competition to play in at club level			2
there ’s a hole there when you are out of it			2
’ the @entity18 is back and @entity6 captain @entity3 is eyeing glory again @entity3 takes on the @entity37 defence in his last @entity18 game back in december 2009 it is why , when he leads out @entity6 against @entity40 on tuesday evening , @entity3 will savour the occasion a little more than usual			1
not so long ago , a meeting with unremarkable opponents from @entity44 would have failed to quicken the pulse but absence has increased @entity6 ’s fondness			1
for a period under @entity49 , @entity6 were regulars at the business end of this tournament , which explains his position when talk turns to what adventures this campaign may unearth			1
@entity3 ’s message is clear : returning to the @entity18 has provided a colourful narrative but it is not the summit of ambitions			1
‘ maybe you forget how lucky you are , ’ he says			2
‘ when you are consistently getting to the latter stages and popping up in finals , it was such an unbelievable achievement			2
but i ’ve got confidence that might not be too far away , if the owners continue to back ( manager ) @entity71 as they have done			2
@entity3 celebrates his dramatic late winner against @entity73 at @entity74 in 2004 @entity75 rises to heads home against @entity77 in the 2008 - 09 @entity18 season ‘ i ’ve got a lot of confidence in @entity71 and in the squad			1
listen , i ’ll put it another way			2
if we go out in the group stages , or the last 16 , we will be majorly , majorly disappointed			1
we want to go as far as we can			0
this ca n’t be a one - off			0
this ca n’t be , “ is n’t it great where we are ? ” ‘ this is n’t a reward for finishing second last year			0
i do n’t see it as a reward			0
this is where @entity6 should be — and should be consistently			1
it ’s the responsibility of myself and the players to give it our best crack			0
it is important that we have got the @entity18 next year as well			1
‘ the players who have n’t sampled this and then get a taste of it — once they have had that taste i know they are going to love it			0
hopefully , it will drive them on to want to keep it at @entity6 for a long time to come			1
’ those who have not experienced those great @entity108 nights need only look at @entity3 to see what big performances at this level can do for a reputation			1
it is , after all , 10 seasons since he immortalised himself when leading a crusade that culminated spectacularly in @entity116 when @entity6 fought back from 3 - 0 down to win on penalties			1
@entity3 celebrates winning the 2005 @entity18 in @entity116 with @entity120 's @entity119 what happened that night in the @entity122 is never far from chatter on @entity124 — @entity3 last week attended the premiere of a new comedy film set around the @entity18 final against @entity128 — but does he ever think about what may have occurred had the comeback not taken place ? ‘ i ca n’t help but think about when @entity134 decided to dink his penalty , ’ says @entity3 , rewinding to the climax of the shootout that @entity6 won 3 - 2			1
‘ if he had put his laces through it or smashed it in to the corner , maybe i ’d be sitting here talking about playing in two losing @entity18 finals			2
‘ i know i was going to be our fifth penalty taker but maybe i could have missed ? they are the small details at this level			0
it is the decision - making from big players in big moments			0
if he had n’t dinked his penalty , the pressure on me would have be humongous			0
who knows what would have happened ? ’ there is a pause as he thinks about it for a moment but then he quickly moves on			0
@entity116 might be his defining moment but he does n’t dwell on it — ‘ i can do that when i hang the @entity161 up ’ — and the appetite to add more chapters to his and @entity6 ’s story is as strong as ever			2
negotiating a group which also contains @entity77 and @entity167 is the first priority and if this inexperienced squad is to do that — @entity3 has made 129 @entity108 appearances for @entity6 , the rest of the squad ’s combined total for the club is 153 — @entity74 must live up to its reputation			1
@entity3 trains alongside his @entity6 team - mates at @entity178 ahead of tuesday night 's game fellow @entity181 @entity180 has a chat with @entity3 on monday afternoon ‘ we understand that we are not one of the favourites , ’ he says			1
‘ there are some big hitters that people will be tipping to win it , but the message from me , as captain of this team , is that we are not making up the numbers			2
‘ we have got such a big advantage over two legs , with @entity74 , that other teams have n’t got			0
let me tell you right now : you come to @entity74 , you ’re getting a terribly hard 90 minutes			0
and we are going to make it even harder for you			0
’ but how will they do that ? they have struggled to replicate the blitzkrieg starts of last season so far and life without @entity206 is still causing adjustments			0
however , the stage is set for someone to take over his mantle and @entity3 hopes it will be the man who has been entrusted with the no 45 shirt			2
@entity214 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity216 as @entity6 prepare for @entity40 @entity214 might split opinion but he is already the subject of a banner on @entity220 and @entity3 , in quiet moments at the @entity178 training complex , has told the @entity223 where he could be propelled if he scores the goals to give @entity6 back their @entity18 season ticket			1
‘ there is no doubt @entity206 is going to be one of the big players in the @entity18 this season , ’ @entity3 says			1
‘ i know how much he wants to play in the competition			0
i had many conversations with him about it			0
but we have got @entity214 now and we have got to move on			2
‘ if we get the best out of him , we have got him			0
if people want to write stories about him and say that he is crazy or he is a nutter , let them			2
but he is one of us now			0
we have welcomed him into this clubs with open arms and we want to help him succeed			0
everyone is hoping he is going to be a hit			0
he has got a great set of team - mates who will work for him and back him			0
he has got to do the same for us			0
’ @entity3 has backed his former @entity6 team - mate @entity206 to star for @entity248 this season @entity3 was speaking at the new adidas # @entity250 event in @entity252 - a live action challenge combining football and gaming			1
