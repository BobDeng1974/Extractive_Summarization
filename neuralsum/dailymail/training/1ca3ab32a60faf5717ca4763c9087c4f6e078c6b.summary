by @entity0 there can be all manner of reasons to take a long journey – a desire to expand one ’s horizons ; a need to re-charge the batteries ; an irresistible case of wanderlust			0
but for @entity14 , his current odyssey has a rather more poignant reason			1
a man with a remarkable plan : @entity14 decided to cycle across the whole length of @entity20 after losing both his parents to cancer still a long way to go : his journey has already taken him through seven @entity26 countries - and will carry him through three more the 32 - year - old @entity27 is midway through a monumental jaunt that was inspired – if that ’s the correct word – by the death of both his parents			1
mr @entity14 lost both his mother and father to cancer ‘ a few years ago ’ – and came to the conclusion that life is too short to waste being ‘ crippled by fear and anxieties			2
’ looking ahead : @entity14 began his odyssey in november , at @entity40 on the lower shoreline of @entity20 , near @entity42 nothing but the two wheels beneath him : @entity14 's vehicle for his grand odyssey is a simple road bike his response ? to plan , and then set off on a trip across @entity20 , using pedal power alone – and raise money for a children ’s cancer charity at the same time			1
‘ i lost both parents to cancer a few years ago , which brought me to fully realise how short life is , ” he explains			2
‘ as a result , i began questioning whether i was actually doing what i wanted in life			0
the answer to this question was a very sobering thought			0
the freedom of the open road : @entity14 has embarked on his epic adventure to raise money for a children 's charity careful where you put your wheels : there have been a few animal encounters along the way - with creatures both large and small ‘ it got to the point where i was fed up living a life crippled by fear and anxieties			1
' but rather than accept it , i decided to do something about it			0
’ the idea of travelling from one end of @entity20 to the other by bicycle was , he says , an immediately intriguing one – giving him a chance to see a continent in detail			2
‘ the simplicity of the bicycle appealed the most , ’ he says			0
moments of levity : although the language barrier has proved an issue , @entity14 has enjoyed plenty of interaction with local people a laugh along the way : @entity14 has taken to explaining to bemused passers - by that he has ' run out of diesel ' ‘ i figured it would mean having to visit and stay in remote villages that would normally be bypassed by other transport			2
’ he began his journey in november , starting out from @entity111 – a beachside suburb of @entity42 which sits due east of @entity20 ’s most famous city , on @entity40			1
have to stop , need a rest : a break for a snooze in the convenient shade of a roadside tree putting down temporary roots : a tent is one of @entity14 's few luxuries as he bids to cycle from @entity20 to @entity125 his route initially took him due north , through @entity20 and on into @entity128			1
here , a sharp right turn helped him to avoid troubled @entity130 and enter @entity131			2
from here , he rolled north - east through @entity133 and @entity134 , before swerving north again and cycling through the wildlife - rich countries of @entity137 and @entity138			1
making the best of it : a rainy day and an encounter with children using a rudimentary - but effective - type of umbrella tough going : as well as scorching temperatures , @entity14 has cycled through rain storms and extreme downpours he is currently in the @entity138 capital @entity149			1
he plans to continue north through @entity150 and @entity151 , before concluding his grand tour on the shore of the @entity154 in @entity125			0
fending off the heat : a desperate bid to cool down under the unforgiving @entity26 sun really starting to feel it : the effort involved in pedalling under the @entity26 sun is all too visible in this revealing image the journey , unsurprisingly , has thrown up a few challenges – with solitude proving to be as much of an issue as the physical exertion			0
‘ it 's hard being alone and being a “ stranger ” all the time , ’ mr @entity14 continues			0
‘ the constant language barrier means it is mostly impossible to find stimulating conversation			0
’ take care : @entity14 's route has taken him through fabled wildlife - rich countries such as @entity131 , @entity138 and - in this photo - @entity137 plenty to look at : a close encounter with an elephant on the road through @entity131 however , he has stumbled across a joke that seems to be widely amusing			1
when asked by puzzled passers - by where he is going and why he is doing it by bicycle , he has taken to replying that he has ‘ run out of diesel ’			0
no need for petrol : this gas station in @entity137 appears to be closed - but this is of no matter to our brave cyclist i ca n't believe you 're doing this : plenty of people have been receptive to what @entity14 is trying to achieve mr @entity14 is writing about his adventures at @entity200			1
here , readers can also donate to his chosen charity , @entity202			0
‘ i see the trip as a platform to take on further adventures and encourage others to start making the changes that i myself was so afraid to make , ’ he says			0
on a line of latitude : a major moment during @entity14 's journey as he crosses the equator in @entity138 into the sunset : @entity14 hopes to conclude his journey in @entity125 later this year			1

@entity14 is currently in @entity138 , midway through a journey that will take him from one end of @entity20 to the other
he began his odyssey in @entity42 in november , and has already passed through @entity131 , @entity137 and @entity138
cyclist is raising money for cancer charity , and decided to take on the challenge after the death of both his parents
