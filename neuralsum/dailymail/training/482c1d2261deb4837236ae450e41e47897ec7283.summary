those who decided to skip @entity2 shopping in favor of a trip to the @entity5 yesterday got to see the natural wonder from an extraordinary perspective			1
due to a rare weather phenomenon , the canyon 's famous gorges were filled with a river of fog			1
according to the national park 's @entity15 page , the fog was caused by something called a ' temperature inversion '			1
this happens when warm air acts as a lid to seal cool air near the ground			2
that means all pollution and fog is trapped and unable to rise			2
most of the inversions only fill up parts of the canyon , or occur on cloudy days			2
yesterday 's inversion happened against a perfectly clear blue sky , enveloping the entire canyon - an event @entity59 says happens about every 10 years			1
ranger @entity59 says some of the tourists visiting the canyon on the busy holiday weekend were disappointed they could n't see the @entity61 below , and just figured it was a normal weather pattern			0
@entity63 waiting for : apparently park rangers wait years to see a temperature inversion happen in the canyon ocean of fog : while the weather caused the canyons to be covered up , many still turned out to photograph the event but she and the other rangers tried to explain just how lucky they were to see the canyon in a perfect inversion			1
once word spread , locals turned out to photograph the unusual view			0
' @entity78 spread like wildfire and most ran to the rim to photograph it			0
what a fantastic treat for all ! ' @entity59 wrote			0
ranger @entity59 described it as being like a ' really awesome beach day ' with all the locals leaving their posts to head to the beach to enjoy themselves			0

friday morning , the gorges of the @entity5 were filled with fog in a rare temperature inversion
a temperature inversion happens when hot air high up acts as a seal to keep cold air pollution and fog trapped below
while inversions happen once or twice a year at the @entity5 , a full inversion is more unusual , happening closer to every 10 years
