by @entity1 reporter published : 11:55 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 16 july 2013 a single @entity3 user is behind the online uproar on monday that pressured literary agent @entity5 to drop a book deal with a member of the jury for @entity10 's murder trial			1
user @ @entity12 expressed her outrage on @entity3 monday evening after the juror , identified only as juror @entity15 , revealed that she was planning to write a book about the trial			1
the user dug up the name of the literary agency , @entity21 , that was planning to represent the juror and encouraged users to message the agency 's owner , @entity5			1
to aid in the process , @ @entity12 posted @entity29 's phone , email and business address - as well as her @entity3 handle			1
' only thing i can think to do is flood @entity5 's phone , email , and snail mail , w / requests that she drop juror @entity15			1
that sound good ? ' @ @entity12 wrote at 8 p.m. monday , just before posting @entity29 's personal information			1
the @entity3 user took the further step of launching an online petition on @entity45 , which quickly gathered more than a thousand signatures , and prompted @entity29 to message @ @entity48 directly			1
' i appreciate your passion for the death of @entity29			1
stand by for a message shortly			2
i grieve his death as well , ' she wrote , according to @ @entity48			2
literary agent @entity5 , left , said the book would explain why the jury decided @entity10 was not guilty of second - degree murder in the death of @entity60 , right , due to @entity62 's laws within an hour , @entity29 sent another direct message that read : ' after careful consideration regarding the proposed book project with @entity66 , i have decided to rescind my offer of representation in the exploration of a book based upon this case			1
' around midnight , @entity29 released a similar statement to the @entity73 and then tweeted a statement from the juror that read : ' i realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to protest our verdict from unfair outside influence , but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case			1
' the potential book was always intended to be a respectful observation of the trial from my and my husband ’s perspectives solely and it was to be an observation that our " system " of justice can get so complicated that it creates a conflict with our " spirit " of justice			1
' now that i am returned to my family and to society in general , i have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before i was called to sit on this jury			1
' the @entity3 uproar that ended the book proposal followed the airing of an interview with juror @entity15 on @entity115 monday			1
the juror , who has been characterized as a white , married mother of two , did not show her face in the interview			1
@entity119 take : the jury member , whose name and face have not been revealed , said that they never believed it was a race - based incident war of words : one of the jury members ( right ) spoke out and said that she felt @entity130 's ( left ) testimony was not credible because of her version of events and presentation she said she believed that @entity10 made some poor decisions in the moments before he shot and killed 17 - year - old @entity60 , but that @entity29 was n't innocent			1
' i think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into , ' she said			2
' i think they both could have walked away			2
' ' @entity60 decided that he was n’t going to let [ @entity10 ] scare him ... and i think @entity60 got mad and attacked him , ' she added			2
prosecutors accused @entity10 of profiling @entity29			1
he was found not guilty of second - degree murder and manslaughter on saturday night			2
literary agent @entity5 had originally said that now - defunct book would explain why the jury reached the decision to acquit the former neighborhood watch volunteer			1
' my hope is that people will read juror @entity15 ’s book , written with her attorney husband , and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how important , despite one ’s personal viewpoints , it is to follow the letter of the law , ' she said			1
cleared : the juror said that she felt that @entity10 went above the bounds of what he should have done but ' his heart was in the right place ' she added that the book has the potential to open discussions about how laws might need to be revised in order to fit with modern society			1
' the reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find @entity10 not guilty due to the manner in which he was charged , ' she said			2
@entity5 has represented books written by high - profile writers , including @entity181 by @entity182 and @entity183 : the @entity184 by @entity185 , due out in september			1
mystery still surrounds the identities of the jury members and there is still no indication of how long the six women , known only to the public as @entity193 , @entity15 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 , will remain anonymous			2
jurors refused to talk to reporters about how they reached their decision on saturday after they received numerous interview requests from media outlets			1
their names are being kept secret until judge @entity205 lifts an order protecting their identities			2
attorneys have argued that the names should not be kept secret			2
national issue : demonstrators protested in @entity213 on monday , two nights after the verdict was handed down rage : a man shouts during a protest march against the acquittal in @entity220 , @entity221 on sunday in june , the judge ruled they would remain anonymous for an unspecified period after the verdict and @entity10 lawyer @entity226 argued they should be kept secret for six months after the trial			0
speculation also surrounds whether or not zimmerman himself will pen a book revealing his experiences			1
the @entity73 suggested he could make money from the project or from a lawsuit he brought against @entity239 last year after it allegedly edited his 911 tapes to make him look like a racial profiler			0
following his acquittal on all charges , he will spend no time behind bars			0
but the @entity245 could file criminal civil rights charges , and @entity10 may face civil lawsuits from the family of @entity29 , who was unarmed at the time of his death last year			1
the verdict has sparked uproar across the @entity253 , with @entity60 supporters claiming that the killing was racially motivated as they stage massive protests across cities from @entity258 to @entity220			0
