being placed in a position of abject fear is an unlikely choice to de-stress			0
but one @entity4 centre is now offering snake massages , which they claim help alleviate stress by taking your mind off other day - to - day worries			0
while clearly not for everyone , the staff at @entity13 's @entity12 and @entity14 may have a point			0
but the science behind the ' relaxation ' theory goes against their claims			0
the centre says the movement of the snakes and the adrenaline triggered by fear is said to have a positive impact on the customer 's metabolism			1
however , adrenaline is released when someone is stressed and it has several effects on the body which relaxing spa treatments aim to counter			1
the snake spa says the movement of the reptiles and the adrenaline triggered by fear is said to have a ' positive impact ' on the customer 's metabolism while being rigid with fear is likely to take your mind off daily woes , clients may need a traditional massage afterwards to recover the novel treatment may appeal to snake lovers however , who genuinely enjoy the reptiles ' writhing feeling when faced with a stressful situation , such as being covered in snakes , the body releases the hormone adrenaline , among other chemicals , which increases your heart rate , elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies			1
so a ' therapy ' that aims to have this effect will only serve to make you feel more wired and on edge as opposed to less relaxed - assuming clients are not accustomed to touching snakes			2
there is a chance that after being frozen in fear with muscles tensed for up to an hour , that customers may need a full body massage afterwards , to need out some new knots			2
bizarre : releasing adrenaline makes people feel on edge as opposed to relaxed , and for most people , touching snakes is likely to have this effect the spa offers numerous treatments including the snake massage with three pythons the new treatment has caused quite a stir in the spa but for those who have a love of snakes , and feel comfortable in their company , perhaps feeling them slither across your bare body might be genuinely relaxing			1
either way , it 's an interesting , if not slightly bizarre , idea and appears to be attracting some inquisitive clients .			0

@entity13 spa offering a ' massage ' with slithering pythons placed on your back
spa claims the fear hormone released has a ' positive impact on metabolism '
adrenaline is unlikely to make customers feel more relaxed , however
