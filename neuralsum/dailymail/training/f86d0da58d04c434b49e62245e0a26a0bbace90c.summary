but congregating on trees in their millions and creating a wonderful orange glow as they fly around , the beautiful monarch butterflies at the @entity8 reserve in @entity9 are a spectacular sight			1
the reserve hosts up to one billion butterflies each year , after they have made their migration from @entity18 in a 2,500 - mile journey to the warmer climes of @entity9 between october and march			1
he said : ‘ i was doing a story to document animal migrations in @entity18 and covering this world famous event was a highpoint in the coverage			2
‘ i loved the fact that so many of the butterflies congregate on the wintering grounds			0
it was like being in an orange blizzard at times			0
‘ it was a really wonderful life experience and one of the reasons i enjoy working as a photographer			0
it 's a world class spectacle that 's well worth seeing and an experience you 'll never forget			0
’ long trips : with a wing span of four inches , the monarch butterfly is known for its lengthy migration and is the only butterfly species to make annual north - south migrations like many bird species photographer : the spectacular images were taken by @entity41 ( left ) , who was amazed by what he saw back and forth : the monarch migrates from @entity18 to @entity9 and back again each year when the butterflies migrate to the reserve they congregate thickly on trees to conserve heat , open their wings to catch the sun 's warming rays and at dawn take flight in their millions and mate			1
' it was like being in an orange blizzard at times ' @entity41 , photographer with a wing span of four inches , the monarch butterfly is known for its lengthy migration and is the only butterfly species to make annual north - south migrations , like many bird species			1
the monarch migrates from @entity18 to central @entity9 and back again each year			2
however , having a life span of only two months , it takes four generations to complete the round trip .			2
