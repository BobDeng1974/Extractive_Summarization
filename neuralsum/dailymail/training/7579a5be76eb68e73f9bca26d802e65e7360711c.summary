in other cases the fraudster left wiring exposed and did not properly fit plug sockets to the walls as shown another plug socket left hanging from the wall after @entity0 was employed to carry out home renovations exposed wiring and messy handiwork were hallmarks of the damage caused by @entity0 to the homes of his targets ' the victims had their dreams and expectations of seeing their homes improved dashed , by the callous actions of a ruthless fraudster , who has been found out , ' @entity191 said			1
lord @entity199 , chair of @entity169 , said reputable trading websites could be duped by fraudsters posing as legitimate traders			0
