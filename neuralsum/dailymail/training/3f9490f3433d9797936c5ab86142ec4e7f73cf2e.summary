@entity0 , 30 , claims she was bullied by her manager @entity1 , as he banned her from attending prayer and had to ask to go to the toilet a ' bullying ' @entity6 boss made staff seek permission to go to the toilet and timed how long they went for , an employment tribunal was told			1
@entity12 - born @entity0 claimed she was bullied by manager @entity1 at the parcel depot in @entity14 , @entity15 , and is suing the @entity6 for discrimination on religious grounds			1
the 30 - year - old told the panel in @entity20 that she was banned from attending prayer while other @entity22 were not challenged and felt she was singled out and picked on			1
in her witness statement , she said : ' @entity1 was horrible			2
he bullied me , harassed me , intimidated me and victimised me most of the time			2
' mrs @entity0 claimed she was made to feel like she could not go to the toilet because her manager would time how long she was gone			1
the tribunal heard that she first encountered problems with mr @entity1 in december 2013 , when he stopped her from using the bathroom at the depot , which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the @entity34 from @entity35			1
representing @entity6 , @entity36 said : ' you claim mr @entity1 stopped you when you went to the toilet and monitored how long you were in the toilet			1
you say this was all part of him maintaining a watch over you			0
' on what basis , apart from the fact that you are a woman and a muslim , were you made to feel discriminated against ? ' mrs @entity0 , from @entity46 , replied : ' because he would not stop men visiting the toilet			1
' the tribunal heard that mr @entity1 asked everyone to tell him when they were leaving the work area , whether it was for a smoking break , a comfort break or to attend prayers			1
the 42 - year - old said he had simply tried to change the ' holiday camp ' atmosphere of his section of the depot when he took on the role of manager in october 2013			2
' when i came to the manual packets section , it had no standards , ' he told the tribunal			0
' i went about inputting very , very , basic standards			0
people should come to work on time , should go to breaks on time and should inform the manager if they are leaving the work floor			2
' that 's all i wanted to implement			0
i did continue to get resistance from my staff			0
' mrs @entity0 said she was challenged when she returned from a toilet break because he believed she had been gone for around 20 minutes			1
ms @entity36 said : ' mr @entity1 says in his statement he would make a mental note if someone was absent from the floor			1
that is not the same as keeping a watch over someone excessively , is it ? ' he is entitled to ask the question if he believed you were away for too long			0
he did n't stop you from going to the toilet			0
' mrs @entity0 , who joined the company in 2007 and worked as a manual sorter at the @entity96 , replied : ' he did			1
' she claims she was subjected to sexual and religious discrimination by mr @entity1 and the @entity6			1
ms @entity36 said : ' what the evidence suggests is that mr @entity1 did not single you out			1
you were all expected to tell him when you left the floor			2
' one month later , in january 2014 , mr @entity1 allegedly stopped mrs @entity0 on her way to prayers			1
ms @entity36 said : ' you say you were not able to perform prayers even though other @entity22 were going without asking permission			0
she worked as a sorter at the @entity6 depot in @entity14 , @entity15 , which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the @entity34 from @entity35 airport ' what else , apart from the fact you are a woman and a @entity22 , made you feel discriminated against ? ' she replied : ' i was the only @entity12 , the only muslim , in that area			1
' mrs @entity0 agreed that the reason she was challenged on that occasion was because she had failed to let mr @entity1 know where she was going			1
to this the defence questioned whether this was a reason for him to challenge her and mrs @entity122 agreed it was ' but he did not ask others and others did not ask permission			2
' ms @entity36 said mr @entity1 had not singled her out based on her sex or religion			1
when pushed on whether this was correct , mrs @entity0 replied : ' yes			1
' the tribunal also heard mr @entity1 allegedly gave mrs @entity0 ' unreasonable ' targets , however , ms @entity36 said : ' you were not the only one who was challenged for your performance			1
' others were challenged and they were not @entity22 employees , ' which mrs @entity0 agreed with			1
in march 2014 , mr @entity1 allegedly isolated mrs @entity0 from her colleagues by moving her to a different department			1
the tribunal heard it was common practice for staff to be moved around and ms @entity36 said : ' he did not move you to isolate you , he moved you because an extra pair of hands was needed			2
your sex and religion has nothing to do with it			0
' however , mrs @entity0 , disagreed with this comment and maintained that her gender and religious beliefs did come into it			1
denying the claims , mr @entity1 said he had never prevented people from going to the toilet , instead asking his staff to let him know when they were leaving the floor for any reason			1
' i asked everyone to notify me when they wanted to leave the work floor , ' he said			2
' it was n't only for prayers			0
i did n't ask people to come to me and say , " please sir , can i go to pray ? " ' as a manager , i need to know where my staff are			2
i would be held responsible for the whereabouts of my staff			0
' i 'm not concerned with how long people had been in the toilet , it was knowing where they were			0
' he stressed that the depot was a high - security operation , with access controlled biometrically with fingerprints and swipe passes , in which he needed to keep tabs on his staff			2
one of his employees at his previous position at airline caterer @entity189 had died in a toilet and was n't found for six hours after failing to tell colleagues where he was going , he added , which gave him ' alarm bells ' if people were gone for a long period of time			0
@entity198 , representing mrs @entity0 , said : ' women have complained about you and said you are a bully and that you hate women - that you are a misogynist			1
' it 's not just one person , or two people , it 's a collection , and i 'm saying mrs @entity0 bore the brunt of it			1
you harassed her on the basis of her race and religion on a daily basis			2
' you stopped her from going to pray , you stopped her from going to the toilet			0
the effect was to stop her from performing her cleansing for prayer			0
' mr @entity1 rubbished the claims as ' ridiculous ' and ' vicious lies , ' saying he himself was a devout muslim who prayed five times a day , and had only stopped mrs @entity0 to question her movements when she had n't told him where she was going			1
he said : ' i pray in order to earn rewards			0
if i help someone else pray , i take a share of that reward			0
' by stopping someone from praying , i 'm committing a sincere , deep sin			0
i find it ridiculous that someone can say i stopped someone praying			0
mr @entity1 , who took the role as manager at the depot in october 2013 , denies the claims saying he has never prevented anyone from going to the toilet ' i would just like to know the reason ( for leaving the floor ) , and then i let them go on their merry way			1
' mrs @entity0 took very strong exception to the fact that i had the gall to even question her movements			1
i believed i was only doing her job as her manager			0
' mrs @entity0 continued to work alongside mr @entity1 under investigation until he left the parcels section on june 22 , 2014 , during which time she alleges he continued to harass her			1
however , he said he was advised by his line manager to be careful and avoid communicating with her			0
the tribunal heard that a number of other members of his staff of around 20 had made formal complaints about his management techniques , criticising his brusque manner			0
he countered : ' what they found problematic was that i managed them			0
' i received complaints from all races , religions and genders			0
' the manager was dismissed from @entity6 on november 7 , 2014 , when his 12 - month trial period had ended , and currently has an appeal in process to try and reinstate his position			2
mr @entity198 suggested he had lost his job because of his bullying manner towards his employees , which mr @entity1 denied , saying : ' the reason given in my dismissal letter was at the 12 month trial period review , because of unsatisfactory performance , my employment was being terminated			2
' he added that 52 per cent of the employees at the sorting centre were @entity22 and he would have been ' lynched ' if he had been found stopping people going to pray			0
' these allegations are false , ' he said			0
' if they were true , i would really have been concerned for my safety			0
' if someone had been stopped from going to the toilet , there would be outrage throughout the plant			0
' judge @entity295 said : ' you say you were moved several times because of your sex and your religion			0
' do you accept when you were moved there was a legitimate need for you or someone else to be moved at that time ? ' mrs @entity0 replied : ' no. there was a procedure which was not being followed			2
' government guidelines say workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day , if they work more than 6 hours a day			0
