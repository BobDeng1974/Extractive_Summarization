by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ on tuesday night in the isolated @entity5 town of @entity6 , @entity3 's patience finally snapped			1
for the fifth time in just over two years , one of their players has allegedly become the victim of racial abuse			2
previous incidents include the subjection of @entity15 and @entity16 to monkey noises in @entity19 competition , a banana being launched at @entity21 in a friendly at @entity23 and @entity24 , a young talent , receiving relentless abuse in a youth tournament in @entity28			1
this time , it was an academy pre-season friendly game and a 19 - year - old boy was the target			1
for his troubles , the teenager was sent off , having kicked out after receiving a verbal volley of abuse from his @entity5 opponent moments before half - time			0
as of wednesday morning , @entity3 were still to ascertain how much the referee had seen or heard of the incident			2
@entity70 manager @entity45 , once alerted to @entity41 's complaint , immediately entered the pitch and after holding discussions with the referee and the @entity3 officials present , the former @entity74 captain ordered his players to leave the field and asserted that the game would not continue			1
it is the most high - profile statement that an @entity83 football club has made against racism in recent times and while @entity3 were keen to stress that this was a club decision , rather than @entity45 's alone , they will know that this decision will reverberate around @entity89			1
@entity45 , a mild - mannered and deeply intelligent man who is aware of his status as one of football 's leading statesmen , will not have taken this decision lightly			2
sadly , the incident appears to have been brushed aside by the @entity5 club			0
move along , nothing to see here appears to be the depressing message			0
youngster : fofana in action during an under - 21 match against @entity104 last season at the @entity106 on their club website , @entity38 suggested that @entity3 , trailing 1 - 0 at the time of the incident , simply could not handle the embarrassment of falling behind against a relatively unknown side			1
the bizarre defence continued with the assertion that the red card was ' entirely justified ' and on @entity45 's actions , @entity38 said : ' to the amazement of a well - filled stadium he took his team off the pitch			1
what are the reasons ? they are known only to him			0
' there is no mention of the alleged incident of racism and no suggestion that the @entity5 side will launch an internal investigation			0
@entity132 understands that @entity3 are in talks with the match organisers and the @entity5 @entity135 to take matters further			2
back at the hotel in @entity5 on tuesday night , @entity3 officials were understood to be incensed by the development and hugely frustrated by this latest case of racism			2
the @entity70 side and under - 18 side have enjoyed two very happy years at their @entity5 training camp and only last friday , the academy head @entity145 was telling local journalists and the complex manager that he would consider a return to the base for a third summer next year			1
he may now be tempted to place a black marker through @entity5 's name when deciding future destinations			0
as for @entity41 , the talented midfielder was understood to be deeply distressed on tuesday night			2
if , as @entity3 unequivocally maintain , he was racially abused , you can understand why a young teenager may respond angrily , even if it is not the ideal reaction to lash out			1
hurt : @entity24 , son of former @entity159 striker @entity158 , was allegedly racially abused by players and fans match winner : @entity24 scored the winning goal as @entity3 advanced into the last eight of the @entity89 competition claim : @entity21 tweeted saying bananas were thrown on to the pitch in a friendly for @entity3 anger : @entity21 took to @entity170 to vent his frustration at the alleged throwing of bananas on to the pitch on their club website , @entity38 suggested that @entity3 , trailing 1 - 0 at the time of the incident , simply could not handle the embarrassment of falling behind against a relatively unknown side			1
the defence continued with the assertion that the red card was ' entirely justified ' and on @entity45 's actions , @entity38 said : ' to the amazement of a well - filled stadium he took his team off the pitch			1
what are the reasons ? they are known only to him			0
' certainly , it is out of character for a charming individual who makes for good company			0
@entity45 rates him among the club 's most promising talents			2
he will comfort the young man and take him under his wing as the group fly back to @entity201 on wednesday afternoon but there is no disguising the anger that has engulfed the players and staff at @entity3			0
just a few months ago , @entity24 , the son of @entity158 , was the victim of perhaps the most revolting torrent of racial abuse encountered by an @entity83 footballer in recent times			1
during a @entity212 match at @entity28 , monkey chants came streaming down from the stands and he also received abuse from opposing players			0
even a tannoy announcement pleading for a ceasefire could not deter the stream of bile being directed his way			0
as he exited the field at full - time , shielded by academy head @entity145 , @entity24 was then spat at			2
he was 18 - years - old at the time			2
' you can not believe what it was like			0
he was really upset by it			0
he was 18 - how can it be allowed ? ' a @entity3 source told @entity132			1
@entity89 saw it worthy only of a fine of £ 8,270 for @entity28 and a partial stadium ban for a future youth game			0
in october last year , monkey chants were directed towards @entity16 in last season 's @entity234 clash in @entity236 and the same kind of alleged derogatory noises aimed at @entity15 during a @entity240 match against @entity57 in 2012			1
making his feelings clear : @entity16 tells referee @entity242 about the abuse from @entity56 fans what 's going on ? @entity16 gestures towards the fans after the midfielder felt he was being racially abused time to act : @entity16 called on @entity89 to take action against fans who racially abuse players @entity250 : @entity16 was the victim of monkey chants from sections of the @entity254 crowd during the game @entity57 were fined only £ 16,700 for the behaviour of their supporters - less than the £ 24,000 @entity3 were fined for returning to the field a minute late after half time , while @entity56 were punished with only a partial closure of their stadium			1
this will not be a case for @entity89 but the meek punishments set a poor precedent			0
who can forget @entity269 's response to the suggestion that @entity15 should walk off the pitch if he were to receive racial abuse at @entity273 : ‘ if a player left the field on his own , he would get a yellow card			1
it ’s not mr @entity15 who ’s in charge of refereeing , ' was the @entity89 president 's pithy reply			0
nobody here is expecting the @entity5 governing body to come down like a ton of bricks on one of their own			0
yet when the authorities continue to turn a blind eye , when @entity89 's punishments remain tame and when @entity296 award @entity294 to countries such as @entity236 , where prejudice remains rife , racism will remain unchallenged on the continent			0
angry : @entity15 punches the ground during an @entity303 game where he was allegedly racially abused as well bad day : @entity15 was supposedly subject to monkey noises during the international game as well			1

@entity3 's @entity70 manager @entity45 abandoned pre-season friendly against @entity38 after incident
@entity38 : ' to the amazement of a well - filled stadium , ( @entity45 ) took his team off the pitch . what are the reasons ? they are known only to him '
@entity35 left distressed after being ' racially abused ' during pre-season
' just disgusting . he was really upset by it . he was 18 - how can it be allowed ? ' @entity3 source tells @entity132
@entity41 is fifth case after @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity21 and @entity24 were subject to alleged racial abuse during games at different levels
