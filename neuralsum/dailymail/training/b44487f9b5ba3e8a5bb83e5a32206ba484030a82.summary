the police are at the centre of a multi-million - pound expenses row after extraordinary spending binges on taxpayer - funded credit cards			1
officials working for a @entity7 policing quango used the cards to buy items such as exotic lingerie and beehives while racking up bills of more than £ 3 million a year			1
last night the quango claimed the underwear had been used to re-enact crime scenes , while the bees were said to be necessary to fertilise an allotment at a staff training college			1
but @entity19 dismissed the defence , calling the spending , revealed under a @entity23 request , ‘ outrageous ’ and demanding an investigation			1
the row comes amid a battle between the @entity27 and senior civil servants over the use of the 140,000 ‘ procurement cards ’ – credit cards embossed with the words @entity7 – which have been issued to @entity34 officials and in town halls around the country			1
ministers were horrified to discover that despite more than £ 1 billion of public money being put on the cards every year , any spending lower than £ 1,000 a month has not been routinely audited			1
and they have been infuriated by what they privately call ‘ blocking tactics ’ at the top of the @entity43 when they have tried to establish how many officials have been abusing the perk by using the cards to make personal purchases			1
just four out of the 25 government departments have released details of internal investigations into the card use			0
the disclosure of secret bank statements shows astonishing spending by the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , a £ 368 million - a - year outfit set up three years ago by @entity59 ‘ to support the police service by providing expertise in areas such as serious crime analysis and the development of new policing technologies and skills ’			1
country retreat : the @entity69 police training centre near @entity70 , left , and right prince @entity71 watches police officers practise their forensic skills at a specially constructed replica @entity75 at the facility a total of 150 of the policing organisation ’s 1,636 staff have been issued with the procurement cards , using them to spend an average of more than £ 20,000 a year			1
the card statements , which cover 2008 to 2010 , detail hundreds of items which appear to be far removed from the world of crime detection			1
they include : £ 51.60 on designer lingerie from @entity89 , which specialises in luxurious ‘ intimate apparel ’ ; £ 28.95 on women ’s underwear from the ‘ beautiful , sexy and stylish ’ store @entity96 ; £ 1,841 on beehives ; £ 205 on golfing equipment ; and £ 1,258 on a lawnmower			1
boss : the @entity57 is headed by @entity99 £ 1,289 went on sightseeing with @entity100 ; £ 55 on karaoke gear ; £ 828 on judo outfits – and 69p at sandwich shop @entity103 , believed to be on a packet of crisps			1
over the two years , the card holders billed the taxpayer for a total of £ 1,386,534 on travel , £ 672,588 on hotels , £ 26,779 on leisure , £ 27,917 on restaurants and bars , and £ 18,196 on ‘ garden services ’			1
the statements show the @entity57 ’s total spending on the cards was £ 2,869,611 in 2008 - 2009 , rising to £ 3,625,405 in 2009 - 2010			1
last night @entity120 mp @entity119 called for an investigation			0
‘ now we know where all the money went under the last @entity125 , ’ she said			0
‘ what on earth are they doing spending money on beehives and lingerie ? it ’s outrageous			2
’ @entity99 , chief executive of the @entity57 – which will be phased out next year as part of the government ’s cull of quangos – admitted the bills could lead to a ‘ perception of wastefulness ’ , but said all spending had been legitimate			1
mr @entity99 , former assistant chief constable of @entity141 , said the lingerie had been bought to simulate a scene of sexual assault at @entity69 , the country retreat at @entity145 , @entity70 , where police are trained in crime - scene investigation techniques			1
he defended the purchase of beehives as necessary to help sustain a market garden at the police staff college at @entity152 , @entity153 , and said other items such as ‘ golfing equipment ’ had been used as part of first aid training exercises			0
‘ it is important to make the training as realistic as possible , ’ said mr @entity99			0
‘ but lessons are being learned			0
if we were buying lingerie as props today , i think we would probably walk into @entity164 to get them			0
‘ the beehives were bought to cultivate the kitchen garden which grows fruit and vegetables at the police staff college in @entity152			0
it is better than flying in food from around the world			0
and you need bees to make a kitchen garden work			2
’ he said the lawnmower had been bought to help maintain the college ’s gardens , the karaoke equipment had been used in the student lounge at @entity69 , and the @entity182 had been laid on for international policing officers who attended training courses – with the costs met by the course fees , not the taxpayer			0
mr @entity99 said : ‘ we have significantly reduced the amount spent through the use of the procurement cards by 33 per cent , from £ 3.6 million in 2009 - 10 to £ 2.48 million in 2010 - 11			1
’ ministers have been alarmed by the seemingly lax approach to auditing card use			0
the cards , introduced in 1997 , the year @entity194 entered @entity196 , were designed to be a convenient way to pay for low - value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies			1
but unlike many company credit cards , which dock the sums spent from employees ’ pay and refund it if the claim can be justified , the bills are settled directly by finance departments out of taxpayers ’ funds			1
suspicions have been raised by the number of items on the bills that appear to cost just less than £ 1,000 – the minimum amount that was usually checked by finance directors			1
@entity59 set up the @entity57 in 2007 , saying the quango would boost police expertise in serious crime analysis , training , operational support and developing new technologies and skills			2
with a staff of 2,174 – now down to 1,636 – and a budget of £ 368million , it is funded by the @entity227 , with a leadership drawn from the @entity229			2
since last year , it has been headed by former @entity231 assistant chief constable @entity230 , given the revelations about officials ’ credit card spending , the @entity57 – which reports to the @entity235 , the @entity236 and the government – was given responsibility in 2009 for making ‘ efficiency improvements ’ to forces ’ spending on goods and services			2
shortly after coming into power , the @entity237 said it would shut the @entity57 as part of its programme of public spending cuts , and hand its responsibilities to other organisations			2
the move has been condemned by @entity59			0
settling up : most cards are black , but senior staff might have a gold or silver one over the 14 years since it was developed , the @entity255 ( @entity256 ) has spread to every corner of officialdom			2
dubbed the ‘ @entity262 on the taxpayer ’ , a total of 71,000 are used in @entity264 , with the remaining 69,000 issued by councils and quangos			0
they are billed as a convenient way to pay for low - value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies , with all bills settled directly by departmental finance departments , but have instead been used far more widely			1
a 20 - page manual declares in bold type that : ‘ deliberate or negligent misuse of the @entity256 may result in the suspension or withdrawal of your card			2
serious misuse could result in disciplinary or criminal action being taken against you			0
’ the manual explains that each card owner has a set ‘ single transaction limit ’ and monthly limit			0
most cards are black , but card holders at the top of the @entity43 pecking order are issued with silver or gold cards that ‘ do not have the single transaction or categories of spend constraints that the black cards have			2
and the full monthly credit limit may therefore be used in one transaction if required ’			0
the rules say the cards can be used ‘ for official business purposes only ’			2
they can not be used for obtaining cash , alcohol or fuel			2
attempts to discover how many officials have been disciplined for breaking these rules have met with resistance from the @entity43			0
just four departments , the @entity309 , have disclosed their figures , which showed 22 incidents had been uncovered , of which eight led to the dismissal of a member of staff			0
the offences included using cards at @entity319 and @entity320			0
the cards were supplied by @entity322 before other companies , including @entity324 and @entity325 , pitched for the contracts			0
last night , @entity322 said the government could do more to regulate the cards ’ use			0
‘ departments have the ability to set controls on point - of - sale transactions to enable them to limit the type of merchants where money is spent , ’ a spokesman said			1
‘ all transactions are transparent and information can be accessed by those in charge of monitoring expenditure			0

@entity344 claim the underwear was needed to *'re* - enact crime scenes ' and bees were essential to fertilise an allotment
spending on luxury hotels , *pleasure* boats , @entity353 trips *...* and 69p on crisps at @entity103
cash spent on the cards is not routinely audited if bills come to less than £ 1,000 per month
