by @entity0 and @entity1 happy together : @entity3 with @entity4 , then eight , in 2004 the decree nisi took a mere 70 seconds to be formally waved through the @entity6 , with neither party present			1
as for discussions over their assets , this took even less time , he keeping his £ 135 million fortune , she content with her own hard - earned £ 20 million			0
no wrangling , no demands			0
it may have been a ghastly , and very public episode over lunch two months ago , when @entity20 was pictured with his left hand grasping his wife @entity3 by the throat , but at least they have now gone their separate ways with good grace			1
privately , a very bitter war goes on			0
even though he accepted a police caution for assault , @entity30 , 70 , continues to insist to whoever will listen that the incident was nothing more than ‘ a playful tiff			1
my actions were not violent ’			0
he is said to be seething that , after ten years of marriage , most of it happy , @entity3 has n’t uttered a single word in his defence			1
in fact , @entity3 , 53 , whose own lucrative television image as a flawless and desirable domestic goddess can hardly have been helped by her being seen as a victim of domestic violence , has , in all this time , said nothing publicly about the incident to anyone			1
‘ to talk about it would only make things worse for everyone , ’ explains one close figure			0
‘ @entity54 to say nothing , let it die away			0
’ for @entity3 this is probably a sensible business strategy as she continues her assault on the huge @entity59 market , having conquered @entity60			2
she is in @entity61 making the second series of the @entity64 - networked reality cookery @entity65 , in which she both stars and is joint executive producer			0
‘ her silence is torturing @entity20 , ’ says one of his friends			1
‘ surely she must realise this			0
’ now , into this traumatic impasse , a new voice has suddenly , and quite unexpectedly , decided to speak out — @entity20 ’s pretty 18 - year - old daughter @entity4			1
she was just seven when her father married @entity3 in 2003			1
@entity3 was newly widowed after her first husband , journalist @entity78 , with whom @entity30 played @entity79 , died of cancer			1
she was left with their two children , @entity83 and @entity84 , who were aged eight and six			2
gone : @entity3 at @entity85 the night before her divorce case was heard at @entity87 's @entity6 @entity4 is @entity30 ’s only child , the daughter of his second marriage to @entity59 art expert @entity90 who — like his first wife , advertising executive @entity91 — does not get a mention in his @entity95 entry			1
@entity4 , who has just left school and is going to university , has grown up living mostly with her father and @entity3 , and her step - brother and sister to whom she is close			1
in recent times , they have all been together at their £ 14 million house in @entity105 , @entity87			0
thus far , the three children have been kept well out of this domestic tragedy			0
but yesterday , @entity30 brought @entity4 to the telephone in @entity109 , where they are on holiday , for her to read out a brief statement that she volunteered to the @entity112			1
with her voice trembling slightly , she said : ‘ the statement is : “ @entity3 has not spoken to me since she left our house on that sunday when the newspaper story appeared			1
she has behaved in a very cold - hearted way			0
she has been my mother since i was seven or eight and has just abandoned me			0
’ silence : @entity3 has said nothing since the pictures of @entity20 grabbing her by the throat appeared in a sunday newspaper this was an extraordinary intervention by the very last person one would have expected to put herself at the centre of this saga			1
so just what drove @entity4 to publicly condemn her stepmother so intensely ? she would go no further			1
politely , after reading out the statement , she said she ‘ can not answer any questions , i ’m really sorry ’			0
friends of @entity3 , however , claim that @entity30 is using his daughter — or at least encouraging her — to attack her stepmother			1
‘ the divorce is really sad for the children but @entity20 should have known better than to let @entity4 get involved in such a grimy situation , ’ says one close observer			1
but a family friend of @entity30 says that it was entirely @entity4 ’s own idea to speak out			1
‘ she ’s completely devastated that she has n’t had a phone call from @entity3 , ’ says the friend			2
‘ whatever issues @entity3 has with @entity20 , she does n’t have them with @entity4			1
‘ and on top of this , @entity4 is furious with @entity3 for not saying anything to defend her father and just leaving him to hang out to dry			1
’ it should be said that @entity3 has not been entirely out of touch with @entity4			1
a month after the infamously photographed incident at @entity155 ’s restaurant in @entity156 , by which time @entity3 had returned to @entity59 to continue filming her television show , it was reported in a sunday newspaper that she had invited @entity159 to join her and @entity83 and @entity84 at the house she was renting in @entity61			1
the invitation came in a text message			0
@entity4 did not accept it			2
instead , according to a family friend : ‘ when @entity4 saw an item about the invitation in a newspaper , she felt she was being used			2
she texted @entity3 to say she did n’t want to be part of her publicity machine			2
’ @entity3 replied that it was nothing to do with her			2
‘ the trouble is , @entity4 misses her so much , ’ says the friend			2
‘ she was like a second mother to her , though she did n’t call her “ mummy ” as she has her own mother			0
it was “ @entity3 ” or “ @entity176 ” , and sometimes even “ @entity177 ”			2
‘ and , of course , @entity4 misses her step - brother and sister , too			2
she just finds it inconceivable that @entity3 has n’t been in touch on the phone			2
she feels very let down			0
’ for her part , through her public relations adviser @entity184 , @entity3 declines to respond to @entity4 ’s charge of ‘ abandoning ’ her			1
given a copy of @entity4 ’s statement , @entity184 replied half an hour later : ‘ we continue not to comment on personal matters			1
’ public spat : @entity3 moved out of the family home as soon as the furore of the choking photos began understandable , perhaps , because @entity3 is said to be anxious about being drawn into an emotional telephone conversation which is bound to be upsetting on both sides			2
no one doubts that @entity4 has been very close to her stepmother for most of @entity3 ’s marriage to @entity30 , and misses her			1
friends do say , however , this closeness had changed a little in the past year			2
‘ @entity3 seemed to be a bit distracted at times , ’ says a @entity30 friend			1
‘ we put it down to her ambition to become a superstar , you know , to conquer @entity59 and become the transatlantic goddess			0
she ’s certainly worked very hard at it and deserves success			0
’ as for her ‘ abandoning ’ @entity4 , it is only fair to point out that @entity20 himself has said that he invited @entity3 to ‘ pack your bags and go ’ when they argued on the day the pictures of him grabbing her throat were published			1
she stormed off that afternoon with a few belongings and moved into a rented flat			0
her friends still say , of course , that she had been willing — right up to the end — to give the marriage another chance			2
his friends , though , say she used the restaurant incident as the perfect excuse to get away from him			0
to cap all this confusion , @entity30 , who slapped in a divorce action long before the dust had had much time to settle , is now telling friends that he did n’t really want the marriage to end			1
denial : privately , @entity20 continues to insist that the incident at @entity155 's was a playful tiff but he says : ‘ however disappointed @entity3 may have been with me as a husband , i ’m heartbroken that @entity4 has been totally abandoned in this way			1
’ this is , of course , a classic example of how children , of any age , can be deeply wounded by warring parents			0
as always , it is difficult , and dangerous , for outsiders to make judgments			0
after all , for many years they were one of the capital ’s most glittering and fashionable couples			0
they seemed completely contented in each other ’s company , enviously at ease with each other ’s foibles , the age difference of 17 years an insignificant detail in their lives			0
@entity20 , always good at one - liners , liked to chaff his pneumatic wife with observations such as : ‘ she ’s too good for me , i know , but she knows it , too , and reminds me every day			1
’ @entity3 , famous for her curves , would say that this was how @entity20 liked her to be : ‘ he would be very dismayed if i suddenly turned into a lean , mean , fighting machine			1
’ intriguingly , in recent months that is just what she did			0
‘ i just got thinner , ’ she told an @entity59 television audience			0
she blamed it on having foot trouble which left her unable to walk to the fridge to help herself to cake and other favourites			0
but she has also admitted having hypnotherapy to help her lose weight			0
there is one other puzzle			0
about a year ago , in an interview , @entity3 described herself as : ‘ very , very conflict averse			2
i go a bit ice maiden			0
’ yet she certainly had not withdrawn six days after the ‘ choking ’ incident , because @entity20 and @entity3 were back at @entity290 , having dinner with a group of friends			1
ostensibly , at any rate , all was well			0
but that was before those reputation - scarring paparazzi pictures dropped on the nation ’s breakfast tables			0
one is entitled to wonder : if that had n’t happened , would they still be together now ? and would @entity4 ’s shattered world still be in one piece ?			2

@entity4 says she has not heard from her stepmother since she left
she was seven when her father @entity20 married @entity3 in 2003
friends accuse @entity30 of using his daughter to attack his *estranged* wife
@entity3 's *spokesman* : ' we continue not to comment on personal matters '
