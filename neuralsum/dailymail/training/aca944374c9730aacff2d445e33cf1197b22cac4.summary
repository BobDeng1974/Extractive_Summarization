sometimes they evolve into production vehicles , sometimes they do n't - but very occasionally , they offer a vision of the future			0
@entity12 's @entity10 - unveiled 42 years ago in @entity11 - was packed with decades - worth of technologies that have become standard in cars			0
the @entity10 not only had digital displays , it also had a primitive magnetic gps system , a rear - view cctv camera , and a hydraulic entry system that would have made the @entity20 jealous - the entire roof lifted off on hydraulic plates			1
now the concept car has been brought back to life at a motor show in @entity11			0
the @entity10 was armed with a rear - view camera , a route guidance system , and hydraulically powered doors @entity12 was a subdivision of @entity29 , and this 1969 model was a showcase for then far - out technologies such as digital instrument displays other ' extras ' that would then have smacked of science fiction included a ' @entity38 ' air - conditioning system , and a radio with auto - seek , rather than a tuning knob			1
even the engine was futuristic - a 4.2 - litre @entity43 , turning out 259hp			1
' at @entity12 we have always prided ourselves on our ability to look into the future through our concept cars , ' said @entity48 , executive director of @entity49			0
' it 's amazing to think that the features we take for granted today were born out of creative minds over 40 years ago			0
' the ' @entity54 ' gps system was perhaps the most out - there idea - showing a glowing arrow that told drivers which way to turn , and a buzzer that warned of an upcoming junction			1
the 1969 @entity10 was a mid-engine , rear - wheel - drive two - seater which showcased technologies such as air con and a radio with auto - seek , rather than a fiddly tuning knob the restored car was shown off at @entity11 's @entity69 show this year - the project to rebuild the car had been ongoing since 2006 the mid-engine , rear - wheel drive two - seater relied on a @entity75 system called @entity54 - which relied on magnets embedded at every intersection			1
although @entity78 had launched in 1957 - and scientists realised that gps systems could be possible quite quickly after the launch - global positioning was still a long way off			2
@entity54 , of course , never took off .			2

restored in *process* lasting since 2006
4.2 - litre two seater had auto - seek radio and rear - view camera
' @entity54 ' gps system used magnets built into road intersections
