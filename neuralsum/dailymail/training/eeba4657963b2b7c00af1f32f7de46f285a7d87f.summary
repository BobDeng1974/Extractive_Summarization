by @entity0 a destructive flatworm is threatening to wipe out @entity4 ’s entire population of snails , experts say			1
the @entity7 flatworm , a vicious predator that overwhelms snails in a ‘ gang attack ’ , was spotted in @entity11 for the first time this month			1
experts fear that it could soon travel into @entity4 , hidden in one of the thousands of potted plants imported every month			1
killer : the worm is relatively large , about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide			0
its body is however quite flat , being less than 2 mm in thickness			0
in the @entity24 , several native land snails have gone extinct because of their voracious appetite @entity26 , head of the @entity27 , said the animal and its eggs cross borders in soil , foliage and branches			2
the flatworm , also known as @entity35 , eats a variety of invertebrates including land snails			2
it is relatively large , about 40 to 65 mm in length and about 4 to 7 mm wide			0
its body is however quite flat , being less than 2 mm in thickness			0
the worm has had several effects on the environments it is introduced to			0
in the @entity24 , several native land snails have either gone extinct or their numbers have drastically reduced			0
currently , there are no known methods for controlling the @entity7 flatworm			1
this makes the eradication of the species especially difficult			0
he said imports of exotic plants had accelerated the spread of other harmful non-native species , including @entity61 hornets , oak processionary moths , and lily beetles			0
mr @entity26 said : ‘ a flatworm that overwhelms snails in a ' gang attack ' and has caused many extinctions when introduced to other parts of the world has now arrived in @entity11			1
‘ urgent action is necessary to save wild @entity4 snails - the @entity72 should close the borders to pot plants			1
’ he added : ‘ it only takes one or two eggs in a pocket of air deep in the soil to survive and a potentially devastating invasive species has crossed over a border and threatens a new country , where there is no strategy to deal with the invader			2
‘ there is no need to import pot plants into the @entity4 - horticulturalists here are quite capable of growing our own pot plants and selling them on the domestic market			1
’ mr @entity26 said that his charity is a supporter for bugs of ‘ all shapes , sizes and habits ’			2
endangered ? experts are concerned that @entity4 's garden snails could be wiped out if the flatworm is accidentally transported on an imported pot plant but he added : ‘ there are some bugs that we are less keen on – bugs in places where they should not be that are causing damage to wildlife			1
’ the government is keeping a wary eye out for the species			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we do not believe that there are any @entity7 flatworms in the @entity4 but we are aware of the threat they could pose to our native wildlife			1
we are currently assessing the risk and will then consider the most appropriate action			0
’ @entity126 - @entity125 of the @entity127 in @entity128 , said : ‘ this species is extremely invasive			2
i really hope it can be stopped at the earliest stages , ’ adding that ‘ all snails in @entity11 could be wiped out ’ .			1
