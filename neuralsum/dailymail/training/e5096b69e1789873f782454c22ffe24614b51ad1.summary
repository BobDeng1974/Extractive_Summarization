when @entity1 climbed off the @entity3 bench with this tie heading towards a replay , @entity0 embraced his old striker on the touchline but dreaded what was coming next			1
‘ i thought “ anybody but him ” , ’ said @entity0 , who once paid £ 7.5million to take the @entity9 to @entity10			0
he only needs one opportunity , and as soon as that big smile was there i thought we could be in trouble			0
’ age has not dimmed the veteran ’s scoring instincts , although exactly what that age is has been questioned by some			0
@entity3 's @entity1 scores the second goal to secure their place in the @entity28 last eight @entity3 's @entity1 celebrates his late winner for the @entity3 with team - mates at the @entity31 officially he is 32 but many were surprised to see him return to @entity34 football with @entity3 last month after spells with @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 in @entity39			1
‘ he told me he was 25 when i signed him at @entity10 ( in 2005 ) so i do n’t know what age he is now , ’ said @entity0 with a smile			0
however , when @entity43 ’s throughball gave @entity1 a sniff of goal eight minutes from time , if felt like there was only going to be one outcome			1
he evaded two @entity50 defenders and buried a left - foot shot in the bottom corner with unerring accuracy			2
he could have done it with his eyes closed			0
this was certainly an improvement on @entity1 ’s debut for @entity3 against @entity59 in midweek when his nose was broken by an elbow to the face			1

‘ we knew what we were getting with @entity1			2
he ’s a goalscorer and we got him in for games like this			0
‘ the cup has been a little bit of joy in a difficult season for us			0
we ’ll take anybody now , home or away			2
’ @entity70 ’s side had been on the back foot until @entity50 were reduced to 10 men six minutes before half - time when @entity77 was sent off on his debut			1
@entity77 had already been booked for fouling @entity43 before he went through the back of @entity96			1
given that his leadership skills were one of the reasons @entity0 gave for signing the combative @entity59 skipper last month , it was irresponsible at best			0
‘ two rash challenges , two yellows , ca n’t fault that , ’ said @entity0 of the decision by referee @entity111			0
@entity3 went ahead eight minutes after half - time when @entity102 pulled the ball back for @entity43 who brought it under control before curling a left - foot shot into the top corner			1

it was the former @entity158 striker ’s fifth goal in six games since joining @entity50 , even though he knew very little about it			2
‘ only he could finish like that , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ his first touch was excellent and second one was even better			0
’ for @entity3 , it more than made up for a defeat in the @entity167 defeat at @entity50 in september			2
but the two teams meet again here on the last day of the season and @entity0 would gladly swap a cup run for promotion back to the @entity173			0
