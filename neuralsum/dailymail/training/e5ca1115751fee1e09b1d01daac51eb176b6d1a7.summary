by @entity0 tipping the scales at 43st , @entity2 , 43 , from @entity3 in @entity4 was unemployed , housebound and miserable			1
@entity2 , a mother of one , had grown so large that she could n't walk more than 10ft and was too fat to cook or do the dishes			1
but after a tough run of bad luck , which included being made redundant , @entity2 finally decided to do something about her obese frame and is well on her way to her goal weight of 200lbs [ 14st ]			1
although she initially embraced her size , after becoming a mother to her nine - year - old daughter , her weight began to spiral out of control , eventually leaving her housebound			1
' before i lost the weight i was basically unemployed and at home all the time doing nothing , ' she explains			2
' all day i just watched tv , i did n’t bother to cook or clean			2
i really did n’t do anything			2
it really made me feel worthless			2
' she adds : ' not only was i super-obese , i was knocking at death ’s door			2
just walking from my bedroom to my living room would cause me to be breathing heavy			0
' currently weighing in at 320lb [ 22st ] , @entity2 has already lost almost half her body weight - helped along by the gastric band she had fitted last autumn			1
difficult : her bulk made it hard for her to do normal activities such as cooking and playing with her nine - year - old freak show : she says that constant staring in the street and cutting comments made her feel worthless but her real goal is to get slim enough to work again - and to be able to go out in public without enduring quizzical stares from passers - by			2
' strangers would feel the need to tell me “ oh my @entity53 you ’re so fat ” ' , she reveals			0
' i would expect it from children because children are curious , but adults ? ' i would be walking to a restaurant , or walking anywhere , and the whole table , everyone in the restaurant would turn and stare			0
i was kind of like a living freak show			0
' it made me feel like i was something to be gawked at , something to be made fun of			0
it felt normal for people to make fun of me			0
' it 's a far cry from her younger days when @entity2 was proud of her size ; setting up an organisation named @entity75 [ @entity76 to @entity77 ] and being squired around the world by men enamoured with larger ladies - her husband among them			1
but those days are long gone and now @entity2 is determined to achieve her goal weight , for her daughter 's sake if not her own			1
30lb and counting : @entity2 was told to lose 30lb by her doctor before she was allowed bariatric surgery better : after undergoing surgery to have a gastric band put in , @entity2 says the weight has dropped off ' my husband and i have been having a really , really hard time in our marriage and in our life and my daughter and i went and stayed at our family ranch , just the two of us , and that ’s when i made the decision [ to lose weight ] , ' she explains			1
' i had been unemployed for , i think , four months at that point and i just decided that in order for me to be able to live a healthy life , i had to do something about it			1
' no - one was going to hire me at almost 600lbs			2
i was n’t going to be able to get a job , so i lost [ weight ] to get a better life and not wind up in bed and half dead in two or three years time			1
' i feel like i probably lost my job as part of some bigger plan in the universe to put me on this path to get healthy			1
' in a bid for extra motivation , @entity2 signed up to appear on @entity120 documentary , my 600lb life , which hits @entity123 tv screens tonight and charts her struggle to slim down			1
she is filmed having a gastric band put in but before that could happen , she was ordered to lose 40lb by doctors			1
painful : although the surgery caused her lots of pain , she 's thrilled she can now play with her daughter on the way : @entity2 has now lost an astonishing 20st and hopes to reach a goal weight of 14st ' instead of eating the fast food at night i would eat a frozen diet dinner , ' she explains			1
' i ate two times a day and it would be a 300 calorie frozen meal each time			0
then i had surgery and the weight just started falling off			2
' now well on her way to her goal weight , @entity2 has also added exercise to her daily regime			1
' in the beginning it was n’t like i could exercise a lot , ' she admits			0
' when i say exercising i mean i started being able to walk without running out of breath			0
i would walk to the mailbox to get the mail			0
' i would park further away from my house rather than park in front of my house			0
i would park at the next house down -15 , 20 extra steps per day			0
now i go to the gym every day			0
' but although @entity2 and her daughter are both thrilled about her increasingly healthy body , not everyone is quite so pleased			1
slimmer : @entity2 , who now weighs just 23st , with her husband			1
he is less happy about her weight loss ' my husband , he loves me but he loves fat women so he ’s really sad , ' she reveals			2
' he ’s sad because the woman he married is not who i am now			0
' we have conversations about this probably once a week , [ about ] how if i had told him that i did n’t want to be a 500lb woman [ when i met him ] , he probably would n’t be married to me			0
' but i did n’t know that then			0
i did n’t know that i was n’t going to be able to walk and i was n’t going to be able to breathe and i was going to be the main caregiver for our only child			0
there ’s a lot of stuff that i did n’t know			0
' @entity2 appears on my 600lb life , tonight at 9pm on @entity120			1
