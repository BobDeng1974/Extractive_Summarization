it will now provide another 1,200 men and women embattled @entity5 admitted two weeks ago it would not be able to supply its 10,400 contracted guards for the @entity2 venues culture secretary @entity28 said , however , the numbers to be provided by the firm ' continue to rise significantly ' but that ministers would ' leave nothing to chance '			1
ministers took the decision to draft in 1,200 troops this morning at a @entity37 for the @entity2 chaired by prime minister @entity38			2
' @entity5 numbers continue to rise significantly and we have every expectation that will continue to be the case			2
' however , ministers decided that we should deploy the additional 1,200 troops that were put on standby last week			0
' on the eve of the largest peacetime event ever staged in this country , ministers are clear that we should leave nothing to chance			0
problems : the army was drafted in because the government could ' leave nothing to chance ' following security problems on patrol : armed forces patrol the @entity59 during the @entity60 new home : soldiers were temporarily housed in barracks in @entity64 , a former shopping centre in east @entity65 , as the government came to terms with the @entity5 security shortfall ' the government continues to have every confidence that we will deliver a safe and secure games			1
' @entity74 chief @entity73 insisted the recruitment of more troops was made to ' de-risk any aspect of the operation '			0
mr @entity73 said : ' with three days to go , we just want to make sure this works without any worries at all			0
' but he added that it was not a sign of private firm @entity5 having any further problems supplying staff			1
a @entity5 security guard has been charged with theft at a hotel where @entity2 footballers are staying			1
the charge comes just weeks after @entity5 's humiliating shortfall in providing staff for the @entity2 , attracting further unwelcome attention for the security firm			1
@entity95 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , was yesterday charged with the theft of a mobile phone at @entity100 , near @entity101 , which is hosting international football teams			0

@entity108 has expressed major concerns after two security guards were arrested at the renamed @entity111 last week when officers discovered they were illegal immigrants			2
@entity108 confirmed the 20 - year - old has been bailed and will appear before @entity115 magistrates next month			0
the extra troops come on top of the additional 3,500 drafted in a fortnight ago as the recruitment gap by @entity5 emerged			1
mr @entity28 said that , with three days to go until the opening ceremony , @entity11 was ' very much on track '			2
the @entity121 said the additional deployment was not because of any deterioration in the performance of @entity5 , which had delivered 1,100 more guards yesterday			2
' but with three days left to the opening ceremony and an incredibly busy weekend we did n't want to leave anything to chance , and we just decided this was the right measure to take , because for the public the most important thing is a safe and secure games , ' he said			2
' it 's better to have those troops on the ground so that were they to be needed they can swing into action immediately			0
' mr @entity73 went on : ' you ca n't be absolutely certain of anything with a temporary workforce			0
' therefore we want to substitute a temporary workforce with a permanent , reliable workforce that we get with the military			0
' the chairman of @entity5 has admitted the world ’s largest security group could lose out on public sector contracts following the shambles over hiring @entity2 guards			1
@entity5 makes more than £ 1bn of its £ 7.5bn annual revenues from public sector work and is currently bidding for nine @entity154 prison contracts as well as services for the police			1
in a separate blow to @entity5 , questions were today raised about the ability of trainees manning crucial x-ray machines at @entity2 venues			1
paying a visit : mayor of london @entity164 visited a police specialist operations room today trainees at @entity2 security firm @entity5 are given several chances to pass exams on running vital anti-terrorism x-ray machines , an insider at the company has revealed			1
recruits at the beleaguered security company are also given just 20 minutes training on machines designed to stop visitors bringing home - made bombs into @entity2 venues			1
@entity5 , already embroiled in chaos for its @entity2 security failings , will have its reputation tarnished further after an insider at the firm said trainees were able to effectively ' cheat ' their way through crucial tests			1
a source close to the firm told the @entity192 trainees who fail tests are given several chances to correctly answer the same questions , and are allowed to confer with colleagues during tests			2
worries over the staffing of x-ray machines were said to have been raised at a government @entity201 , amid more fears that @entity5 can not supply the required numbers to monitor the devices			1
military police officers will be deployed alongside regular patrols in central @entity65 during the @entity2 , it has emerged			2
the unprecedented decision to use officers from the @entity209 ( @entity209 ) alongside the @entity210 comes as the capital hosts thousands of soldiers to provide security during the games			2
officials are worried the influx of troops in @entity65 could spark trouble , especially during rest days and weekends , when they are expected to flood the pubs and bars in the city 's @entity221			0
the soldiers , who have been deployed at short notice , will have two days off each week and are expected to want to relax in pubs and clubs of central @entity65			0
rmps are expected to patrol in their regular @entity228 camouflage uniform and red berets - a potentially alarming sight for people not used to seeing the military in public places			0
the move has come about following the @entity5 fiasco , which has led to the call up of 3,500 troops to step in and police @entity2 venues at the last minute			1
police and @entity226 are understood to have visited pub and bar owners in the @entity243 area of central @entity65			0
they have asked bar owners to call a dedicated army hotline if they believe soldiers are involved in trouble , rather than call the police			0
the metropolitan police refused to discuss details			0
@entity5 said today it was ' not uncommon ' for trainees to repeat tests , before insisting it had followed industry regulations in designing the exams , which were approved by @entity74			2
but despite its assurances , the latest blow to @entity5 's credibility could lead to the security company losing several key public sector contracts			1
trainees for the role of ' screener ' - those who monitor x-ray images for suspect contents - are mostly trained on computer simulations , with a small period set aside for work on the machines themselves			2
an insider at the firm told the @entity192 that of a recent group undergoing training at @entity5 , only five per cent passed first time			1
one @entity5 trainee told the @entity192 : ' those who failed were allowed to retake the exact same modules , endlessly repeating them until they scraped through			1
' you could take the test as many times as you liked before the end of the day at 5pm			0
' there were two invigilators but no attempt was made to stop people cheating			0
i do n't think the training has properly prepared people for working as ' screeners ' on the x-ray machines			1
' a @entity5 spokesperson today said the repeated tests were ' not uncommon ' , and that it encouraged trainees to work through tests ' at their own pace '			0
a spokesperson said : ' trainees who fail the final @entity300 test by a small margin are given the opportunity to re-take the marginally - failed section of the test , once only			0
' this is done to allow for varied learning pace			0
' the candidates work through practice modules and the subsequent ‘ test ’ modules at their own pace on their own pc ’s with trainers available should the candidates have any issues			0
' we offer advice and guidance but do not direct the participant in how to dispose items			0
it is not uncommon or wrong to repeat modules			0
