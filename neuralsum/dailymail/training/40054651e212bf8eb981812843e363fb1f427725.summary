@entity0 insists he will win his first world title on saturday night but is unsure whether he will ko @entity3 tough guy @entity2 ‘ in the first round ’ or battle his way to a decision ‘ at the end of a dog - fight			1
’ the moment of truth is likely to arrive somewhere between those two extremes and the manner of it will probably depend upon how long @entity0 ’s self - confidence holds up under the pressure of what he must expect to be the most exacting fight of his career			1
the incentive for both these young men ‘ to go through hell ’ is most eloquently expressed by @entity0 : ‘ the winner will hold the keys to @entity24			1
for @entity2 the mother - lode would be a mega-bucks fight with mr @entity48 himself , @entity49 , to which he would edge closer with an impressive victory over @entity51			2
an alternative bonanza for either could come in @entity53 , with @entity54 ready to keep a watching brief at ringside this weekend while saying : ‘ if i do decide to box again i want it to be against the winner of this fight			0
’ all very tempting but neither @entity0 nor @entity2 would be wise to get ahead of themselves			1
their duel for @entity2 ’s @entity65 welterweight title comes at a watershed moment in their careers			1
both are coming into their prime , @entity0 at 28 and @entity2 at 26			1
for the victor the only way is up			0
for the vanquished it will be back to the small halls			0
the jury is out on each of them			0
so much so as far as the public are concerned that in order to come to close to filling the @entity80 in @entity82 promoters @entity83 are having to stack the under - card with the high - profile likes of heavyweight knock - out sensation @entity86			0
the balance of risk is more or less even			0
champion : @entity2 will need to be at his best against @entity0 to retain his title in @entity82 confident : @entity2 knows he must see off @entity0 if he is to earn the right to face @entity49 home comforts : @entity2 will defend his title on @entity3 soil on saturday night @entity2 has nothing to gain from putting his growing reputation on the line against a @entity99 who offers a genuine threat but is barely known in the in @entity3			1
he says : ‘ i have always been the one under pressure on my way to the top and i know i ’m again the one with most to lose			0
’ @entity0 has to surrender home advantage to get the world title shot he regards as long overdue and @entity3 is never an easy place to secure an away win			1
he says : ‘ i have to raise my game the way @entity110 did to win his world title over here when everyone expected him to lose to @entity114 ,			2
’ and raise his game he must if he is to emulate the @entity110 ’s feat of 28 years ago			0
many saw it as a sign of weakness when @entity0 was reported to have asked his handlers if he was ready to challenge @entity2 , even though title bids scheduled previously had been scuppered by injuries to himself and @entity124			1
but if he did put that question , it was valid			0
@entity0 has been fed a diet of mostly moderate opponents so while he is talented and does pack a meaty uppercut he remains untested at the highest level in his 32 wins to date			1
@entity2 , by contrast , warmed up against increasingly hotter rivals			2
now his 25 - fight unbeaten career has been brought nicely to the boil by a final eliminator against @entity137 , his successful world title challenge to @entity124 and a first defence against @entity140 – all three of whom are former two - time champions			1
it is that elite experience which is missing from @entity0 ’s resume and it is less than encouraging to recall that he only just held on for a squeaky victory over @entity3 journeyman @entity148 as he faded towards the end of their first fight			2
untested ? @entity0 's biggest win came against former world champion @entity153 down and out : @entity2 was in a destructive mood when he stopped @entity140 @entity0 is a couple of inches the taller but @entity2 , a trimmed down light - middleweight , is a compact , powerful , heavy - punching athlete with , curiously , an equally long reach			1
the @entity159 is also as effective at close quarters as they both can be at long range			0
@entity0 says : ‘ @entity2 is good but was not keen to take me on and has had to do it or be stripped of the title			1
’ @entity2 says : ‘ i ’ve wanted this particular fight for a long time			2
it is the ideal fight for me to prove myself as a top boxer and fighter			0
’ so who wins ? i would be more of a @entity42 optimist if @entity0 had been tempered against better opponents			2
he has a chance but if he is going to pull this off away from home and with nagging doubts about his stamina then perhaps he had better do so sooner , like the first round , than later , via the scorecards			0
brook vs @entity2 is live on @entity182 this saturday once again , good luck to @entity184 in a new life as ms @entity186 and freely admitting : ‘ there is still a lot to overcome			0
’ and well done to @entity189 for sending his best wishes to the manager who guided him to the world heavyweight title .			0
