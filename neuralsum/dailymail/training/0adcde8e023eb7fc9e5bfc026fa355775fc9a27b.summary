by @entity0 after the horsemeat scandal of earlier this year , we now have the chicken fiasco , where major chains have been exposed for selling frozen chicken with shockingly high levels of added water			1
an investigation this week revealed that some chicken breasts on sale in the @entity11 are made up of no less than 20 per cent water			1
what you think is a juicy chicken breast may in fact have been pumped full of water , either mechanically injected or through an industrial process known as tumbling — and what is worse , chemical additives are also added during the procedure			1
additives : what you think is a juicy chicken breast may in fact have been pumped full of water , either mechanically injected or through an industrial process known as tumbling the study highlighted one case of raw , frozen chicken breasts imported from @entity31 into @entity11 and then sold in our supermarkets			1
while still in @entity31 , salt and corn oil were added to the chicken breasts			1
once in @entity11 , the breasts were thawed out and put through the vacuum - tumbling process			1
this saw water and chemical additives absorbed into the meat , increasing its weight and giving it a juicier , but wholly unnatural , texture			1
the breasts were then re-frozen and sold in the aisles of major retailers such as @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
a curious double standard seems to be in operation here : home cooks are sternly warned never to re-freeze previously frozen meat , unless they have cooked it thoroughly			2
but behind the scenes of food manufacturing , frozen meat is being defrosted , pumped up with water and additives , then re-frozen all over again , and consumers are none the wiser			1
it is not illegal to add water and additives to chicken , as long as the additions are clearly displayed on the label			1
but the technical legalities are not the only issue here			2
there is also the unfairness of asking the public to pay more for a product than is justified			2
many of us will feel cheated at the thought of having to pay for the added water , which works out at up to £ 1.54 a kilo			1
what ’s more , these tumbled chicken breasts are a symbol of how heavily - industrialised , intensive production now dominates the food chain , robbing the public of the natural flavours and wholesome goodness that we ought to expect from a succulent chicken breast			1
what is particularly worrying is that we do not yet know the implications for our health , since there has been no in - depth analysis of the consequences of eating these adulterated meats			2
but it is hardly likely that eating chicken filled with water , salts , oil and additives will prove @entity103 the @entity105 controversy continues to demonstrate , working against nature is rarely a good idea			1
and that is precisely what is being done here			2
normally , when meat is cooked , it loses liquid , but the meat processors are doing precisely the opposite , by actually pumping in fluids containing a cocktail of chemicals			2
" their art consists of taking a pig ’s ear — sometimes literally — and turning it into a profitable silk purse			2
" - @entity0 though this week ’s news has focused on chicken , the technique of adding water and additives is applied to a vast range of produce , including ham , bacon , frankfurters , sausages , turkey rolls , luncheon meat , sandwich fillers and ready meals			1
indeed , almost any low - grade , mass - produced , frozen or processed meat will have been treated this way			2
and it goes beyond meat			2
even seafoods such as scallops are regularly soaked in water with phosphates to increase their size — though inevitably much of the taste is lost			1
the sheer number of foods that are adulterated in this way attests to the boundless creativity , advanced technology and cost - cutting zeal of the food processors			2
their art consists of taking a pig ’s ear — sometimes literally — and turning it into a profitable silk purse			2
their central objective is to make the meat or seafood absorb a significant quantity of water			1
water is cheap and easy to source			1
meat is much more expensive			2
the result of this process is inevitably that the customer ends up paying way over the odds for the water			1
the controversial process usually begins when the manufacturer acquires his supply of what is called ‘ trim ’ , usually pieces of boned , frozen meat			0
his next task is to bulk out the trim by getting it to absorb water and additives			1
for this to happen , the manufacturer has to create a ‘ brine ’ , a chemical solution that will encourage the meat to retain liquid using binding agents			0
these binding agents are usually from five main sources , which can be used separately or mixed together			0
the first is transglutaminase , an enzyme that is essentially a natural glue			0
indeed , it is sometimes called ‘ meat glue ’			0
the second is from a group collectively known as hydrocolloids , substances that form a gel on contact with water			1
these hydrocolloids include carrageenan , which is derived from seaweed , as well as the exotically named locust bean gum — extracted from the seeds of the carob tree — and guar gum , which derives from ground guar beans			0
the third widely - used agent , especially in seafood , is phosphate , which is taken from phosphoric acid and is valued for its ability to make oil adhere to water			1
the fourth is fibre , made from a source such as wheat , citrus or cellulose			0
and the fifth is protein powder , which is made by extracting collagen from pigs ’ skins			0
protein powder comes in several different forms , such as pork pellets and broth powders — made from dehydrated , skimmed chicken stock			1
there is also a soya protein that tends to be made from genetically modified crops			0
supermarkets : the breasts were then re-frozen and sold in the aisles of major retailers such as @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 once you know this , none of our mass - produced foodstuffs sound remotely appetising			1
but it gets worse , for the next task is to get the brine into the meat			0
this can be done in two ways			0
the first is through vacuum - tumbling , the method that has been in the news this week.the most common approach when it comes to vacuum - tumbling is for the meat to be placed with the brine in a machine that looks like a concrete mixer			0
the meat is then agitated as the mixer spins , the continual turning accelerating the absorption			0
the second method is the injection of the brine straight into the structure of the meat through a series of needles attached to an instrument that looks rather like a steel brush			0
one company has boasted that , through the injection method , 100 kilos of meat can be easily bulked up to a weight of 165 kilos with the addition of brine			0
it is no wonder that the manufacturers have so eagerly embraced all this tumbling and @entity287 internal brochure for the industry captures this enthusiasm , explaining that the process ‘ transforms worthless cuts of meat with low value into standardised portions with a high added value ’			0
in promoting this approach , the industry uses overblown language that extols the improvements brought about by the process			0
so processed meats are ‘ easier to slice ’ and feel ‘ succulent but firm ’			0
each mouthful is ‘ slightly resistant but juicy ’			0
other products are praised for their ‘ cohesiveness ’ , as if that were a quality that the public actually look for in a piece of meat			0
‘ mmmm , i really like this chicken breast , it ’s so cohesive , ’ they imagine us saying as we tuck into our dinner			1
that just shows how far the manufacturers have departed from reality			0
but it is all a huge con			0
whatever language the manufacturers use , the public are getting neither value nor taste			0
this is not the way meat should be eaten			0
the ham we find in our petrol station sandwiches has the consistency of a limp handshake and all the flavour of an old tyre precisely because it has been through such a destructively intensive process , pumped up with water and held together by chemical gel			1
those who suffer the most are those who eat in fast food restaurants and big institutions such as schools , hospitals and the @entity344 , where the needs of mass catering and limited budgets leave the managers vulnerable to the bulk merchants			0
yet our reliance on ‘ restructured ’ and ‘ reformed ’ meats and chemical ‘ emulsions ’ is a false @entity353 is not real , natural meat , but an industrialised meat - like substance			0
eating cheap meat like this is a mug ’s game — we may think we are getting a bargain , but we are paying through the nose for water and chemicals that ca n’t positively do us any good .			2
