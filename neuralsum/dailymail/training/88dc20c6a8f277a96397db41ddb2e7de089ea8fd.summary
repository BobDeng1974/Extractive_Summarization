@entity0 has teamed up with @entity1 to create a concept car capable of taking over if it thinks the driver is feeling sleepy			1
the futuristic car will use @entity1 ’s @entity6 ( @entity8 ) technology to automatically dim headlights , brake and stay in lane			1
while biometric systems will monitor the driver ’s eye movements and alertness to make sure they do n’t fall asleep at the wheel			1

the futuristic car will use @entity1 ’s @entity6 ( @entity8 ) technology to automatically dim lights , brake and stay in lane			1
while biometric systems will monitor driver eye movements the concept car is expected to be unveiled during the firm ’s keynote presentation at next month ’s @entity29 ( @entity29 ) in @entity30			1
@entity1 ’s @entity8 uses a stereo camera setup , fitted with two lenses that watch the road ahead			1
it can plot the location of lane markings , to make sure the car does n’t drift out of lane			1
the camera ’s also spot when cars are approaching and will automatically dim the headlights to avoid dazzling the oncoming driver			1

elsewhere , the system brakes automatically if it spots potential dangers such as cyclists and pedestrians			2
the biometric systems will track the wideness of the driver ’s eyes , as well as how much they are moving and taking in the road ahead			1
this system will link with @entity1 ’s @entity8 and could either take over the controls if it thinks the driver is about to fall asleep , or will use light and sound alerts to wake them up			1

the car wo n’t be fully automated , however			0
instead , the driver will be able to take over some control of the car by touching the steering wheels , or pressing the pedals			2
@entity0 provided a virtual preview of its future concept car at the @entity84 event in november			0
‘ autonomous vehicles will be commonplace and socially accepted in the cities of the future , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ with the new luxury - class interior concept , the car of the future will be more than purely a means of transport - rather , it will become a variable and private area of retreat in increasingly dense urban traffic			2

it can plot the location of lane markings to make sure the car does n’t drift out of lane			2
there is also a single camera sensor module available ( left ) @entity0 provided a virtual preview of its future concept car at the @entity84 event in november			0
the front seats of the car can be turned around and passengers can spend their time relaxing or working , while screens can show films - or live camera feeds from the outside world ( pictured ) the main feature of its future car is a ‘ variable seating system ’ that features four rotating lounge chairs that let people face each other			0
this means the front passengers can turn and talk directly to the other passengers while on the move , when the car is in autonomous mode			0
or they can focus their attention towards the front when driving manually , and an extendable steering wheel gives the driver more options			0
@entity0 added that the interior becomes a ' digital living space ' which is comprehensively networked as an integral part of the intelligent vehicle system the concept car will also feature @entity138 ( illustrated ) currently being developed by the @entity140 firm to power its range of semi-autonomous cars			0
one such feature is @entity144 , which automatically follows traffic and helps the driver steer elsewhere , the interior will become what @entity0 calls a ‘ digital living space ’			0
drivers and passengers will be able to interact with the car ’s controls , temperature , music and more using gestures and touch displays			0
the concept car will also feature intelligent driver technology currently being developed by the @entity140 firm to power its range of semi-autonomous cars			2

‘ we are convinced autonomous driving will be a central factor on the way to comfortable , accident - free driving , ’ said @entity0 @entity0 's car wo n’t be fully automated , however , unlike @entity179 's self - driving vehicle			1
instead , the driver will be able to take over some control of the car by touching the steering wheels , or pressing the pedals			0
the first working version of @entity179 's car ( pictured ) was revealed last week the driver only needs to accelerate and brake			2
‘ we are convinced that autonomous driving will be a central factor on the way to comfortable , accident - free driving , ’ said professor dr @entity189 , @entity190 and chief environmental officer for @entity192 ‘ autonomous driving relieves pressure and stress in driving situations usually regarded as tedious – for example in tailbacks , in inner - city areas or on long journeys			0
‘ with our innovative interior concept of a luxury lounge for an autonomous vehicle of the future , we are giving a specific outlook on our ideas of future mobility			0
’ this interior concept is part of an overall vehicle concept the firm is expected to unveil at @entity29 in @entity30 next month			1
in september , the @entity140 car maker took the covers of its @entity218 prototype			0
the truck features a ' @entity220 ' that scans the road ahead , stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track , as well as reclining chairs and a tablet remote control			1
the prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a @entity140 autobahn in july , during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck - maker @entity192			0
on the front of the truck is a series of @entity237 , which illuminate the front fascia and headlights when the engine is started			0
when the lights flash orange , it alerts fellow drivers to the fact the truck is driving itself , and these lights turn blue when a human driver is back in control			2
@entity250 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining driver 's seat , tablet computer controls and ' mirrors ' and a chill - out space			2
the driver ’s seat can also be turned by 45 degrees , to make it more comfortable on long journeys , and the tablet can be removed and used to watch films , for example , when the truck is in autonomous mode			0
the truck is also equipped with radar sensors and camera technology that helps the autonomous driving system , called @entity220 , plot the road ahead			1
the technology is similar to how an autopilot on an aircraft works , and in the @entity274 , the stereo camera scans the road 328ft ( 100 metres ) ahead ; 45 degrees horizontally and 27 degrees vertically			1
these cameras can identify single and two - lane roads , obstacles including moving and stationary objects , pedestrians and more			2
the camera is fitted to the instrument panel behind the windscreen			0
@entity274 2025 also makes fuller use of features already found in current production models , by networking on - board sensors with automatic braking , stability control and lane - warning systems			2
as the vehicle 's name suggests , the intention is to launch a roadworthy version by 2025 .			0

self - driving car will use @entity1 's @entity6 ( @entity8 )
this technology uses stereo cameras to plot and monitor the road ahead
it can automatically dim lights , apply the brakes and keep the car in lane
elsewhere , biometric systems monitor eye movements and alertness
if it thinks the driver is falling asleep it can take over , and sound an alarm
car will be unveiled at the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) in @entity30
