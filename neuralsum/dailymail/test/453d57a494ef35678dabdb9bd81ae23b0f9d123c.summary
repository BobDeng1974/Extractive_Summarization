@entity0 's @entity5 will use @entity32 's existing infrastructure to offer these networks and plans			1
' @entity0 is unique because we speak to more customers across the networks than anyone else			0
this gives us a unique customer insight , ' @entity39 and @entity40 chief executive @entity38 told @entity13			0
the @entity43 ( logo pictured ) will use @entity32 's existing infrastructure to offer networks and plans ' they tell us what could be better across the whole of the industry and @entity5 is based on that insight ; giving customers what they want			1
' we 're building this network from scratch and are using the latest technology to connect and build @entity5 , and because tech is moving so quickly we 've been able to come up with something innovative and different			2
' he said that at launch @entity0 is creating a platform for the network and in ' two to three months ' time [ it ] will launch products that no - one else will have			2
' but mr @entity38 would n't reveal what these will be in order to maintain a competitor advantage over rival networks			0
he continued that the aim is to have all the handsets it currently sells available on the network			0
' the reason we are putting 12 - month contracts and deals out there is that there is no - one else offering such 12 month contracts and our customers said it was a feature they wanted , ' he continued			1
@entity5 wo n't the only network to offer 12 - month contracts , though			1
@entity87 , for example , has a range of contracts that start at £ 9.50 a month			0
when @entity5 launches it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries , shown in the graph above			1
this will put it ahead of three with 18 countries and @entity30 on 17 @entity0 's boss @entity38 said the @entity5 website will launch tomorrow , where people can register their interest			1
the full range of plans will be announced as they become available , but an example offers the @entity105 ( shown ) on a 12 - month 4g plan with 300 mins , 5000 texts and 1 gb data for £ 19.50 in terms of next steps , mr @entity38 said the website will launch tomorrow where people can register their interest , and the network as a platform will launch in may - although he did n't give an exact date			1
two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network , @entity116 is now said to be looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees			1
the tech giant is said to be in talks with @entity122 , the owner of the @entity124 , to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost			0
industry sources said the firms are discussing a ' wholesale access agreement ' that would help @entity116 create a global network			0
@entity116 's vice president @entity135 confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at @entity140 in @entity141 in february			1
it will be initially offered to cities that have @entity144 , such as @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 and @entity116 is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan			0
the firm will also be launching an app to manage billing and then new features will be announced during the summer that mr @entity38 described as ' just fantastic and very innovative			0
' the full range of plans and offers will be announced as they become available , but an example plan offers the @entity159 on a 12 - month 4g plan with 300 mins , 5,000 texts and 1 gb data for £ 19.50			1
' this is just the beginning , ' added mr @entity38			0
' we know that there are lots more customer issues and frustrations with existing mobile plans that we 're eager to tackle			2
' we want this network to be focused on the individual and we will continue to listen to customers over the coming months , asking them to help develop and evolve @entity5			2
' other features include controls and caps to help people prevent ' @entity178 ' - surprise costs and fees added to their account			0
@entity5 is the first major initiative from @entity182 and will be available to customers via all @entity0 , @entity185 and @entity186 stores , as well as online			2
@entity188 , telecoms expert at @entity189 told @entity13 : ' it 's quite a coup that @entity5 piggybacks off @entity32 's network given that @entity0 has n't offered any deals from the network in years			1
perhaps @entity194 was the olive branch			0
' the promise of 12 - month contracts is likely to be a major win with mobile users who crave flexibility - we know that because of the rising popularity of @entity205 - only deals			1
' but @entity5 's success all hinges on how keenly these shorter contracts are priced			2
we eagerly await more concrete details , in terms of cost and the full range of handsets that will be offered			0
