@entity0 has warned @entity1 that he will have to reinvent himself as a boxer if he is to beat @entity3 in the richest fight of all time			1
@entity0 , as he celebrates the 30th anniversary of the first fight of his own phenomenal career , predicts that the @entity9 will lose to the @entity3 unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence and comes to fight in @entity11 on may 2			1
the casino odds - makers have installed @entity1 as favourite and opinion in boxing is divided approximately along the lines of the 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the @entity20 man			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 's tactical style will work against him against @entity3 @entity1 ( left ) will fall to the @entity3 unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence on may 2 @entity1 meets @entity3 in the richest fight of all time and the boxing community is split on who will win but @entity0 says : ‘ i thought from the start that @entity27 is going to win			1
this guy is perpetual motion			0
he comes from every angle			0
‘ @entity1 tucks in and picks his shots and he is more accurate			2
but he does n’t throw anything like @entity3 ’s hundred punches a round			1
‘ it ’s unlikely he can knock @entity3 out so if he wants to win he ’s got to change			2
unless he throws more punches he ca n’t win the rounds			0
’ @entity1 , at this wednesday ’s official , show - bizzy launch of the $ 350 million to half - billion dollar promotion , made it clear that he regards this @entity44 as business usual , saying : ‘ we ’ve started training real well			2
@entity47 to do what we always do			0
doing what has won all our 47 fights			0
’ @entity1 has acknowledged that ‘ we will both be the best boxer we possibly can because we both want to this fight more than any other in our careers			1
’ to which @entity0 says : ‘ not enough			2
he ’s got ta do something different			0
he needs to take a look at how the only opponents who have given @entity3 trouble are @entity60 and @entity61 , who also throw a hundred a round			1
’ @entity0 says @entity1 should be looking at the boxers who have troubled @entity3 , including @entity61 who stopped the @entity64 in 2012 at the venue he will fight the @entity66 at on may 2 @entity60 was another busy fighter to get the better of @entity3 , although @entity3 won last year 's rematch by his own formidable force of nature , @entity0 naturally inclines towards the aggression in the ring which first exploded upon a startled world 30 years ago last friday			1
@entity0 is lifted by promoter @entity73 after his 1986 win over @entity75 , one of 44 knock outs early on in his formidable 50 - win career as he embarked on his journey towards becoming the youngest world champion in heavyweight history at 21 , @entity0 entered the ring at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 as an 18 - year - old and blasted out one @entity86 in the first round			1
that was the first of his 44 knock outs in a 50 win career which also included two no decisions and subsided at the end into six defeats			0
@entity0 , now 48 and successfully reinventing himself in movies , video games and one - man shows , also blew the hundreds of millions of dollars which @entity1 is now earning			1
and did he have let slip a startling secret about the massive earning power of the money - @entity3 collision ? he said : ‘ @entity1 ’s getting $ 250 million for one night ’s work			1
’ he made that remark while promoting @entity104 , a feature - length documentary about the pitfalls as well as the thrills of the fight game in which he stars with arch - rival @entity109 and which opens in @entity66 cinemas this friday			0
the film is the focal point of @entity0 ’s campaign for @entity115 regulation of boxing			2
he says : ‘ ours is the only sport in which the participants are not protected by law			0
@entity0 spoke while promoting @entity104 , a feature - length documentary about the pitfalls and thrills of boxing in which he stars with arch - rival @entity109 - the film opens in @entity66 cinemas this friday ‘ @entity125 generally come from the poorest backgrounds			2
@entity127 ca n’t read or write when they start out			0
people like me and @entity1 earn hundreds of millions of dollars and sometimes do n’t know what to do with it			0
‘ and what about those who still get no more than 20 grand a fight ? they can still get exploited so much that when they need a brain scan they ca n’t afford it and by then there ’s no - one else to pay for it			0
’ will those cautionary words – coupled with memory of how @entity0 battered his way from rags to riches to prison to bankruptcy and now to redemption – convince @entity1 to stop gambling and buying the most expensive cars and planes or @entity3 to limit how much of his fortune he gives away to the poor in his native @entity64 ? probably not .			1

former heavyweight champion @entity0 predicts a @entity3 *victory*
@entity0 said @entity64 's ' hundred punches a round ' is too formidable
