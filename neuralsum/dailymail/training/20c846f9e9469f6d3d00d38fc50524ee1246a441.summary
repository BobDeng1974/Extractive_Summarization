it ’s been a while since we have seen this			2
@entity4 dominant and convincing , a result that never looked in doubt			1
yes , @entity7 had their moments early on			2
yes , they had early opportunities and should have been awarded a penalty with the game goalless			2
but did @entity12 ’s improving @entity4 ever look as though they would do anything but win here at @entity15 ? no , not for a moment			1
this was how it used to be under sir @entity19			0
@entity4 were confident and sharp , assured in their passing and their execution of opportunities			1
they won with something in reserve , with modern day makeweights such as @entity26 on the field as substitutes by the hour mark to spare the energy of the stellar names until their next appointment — at @entity33 — on sunday afternoon			2
@entity33 can not possibly defend as naively as @entity7 did here while @entity4 tend to be somewhat less convincing away from @entity67			1
nevertheless , there is definite progress to be seen in @entity71 ’s team			0
while the @entity73 version of last season enjoyed a decent run at this time of year and then slipped rather inevitably into terminal decline , @entity71 ’s @entity4 look rather like their best days this season may yet be ahead of them			1
certainly they were helped here by a @entity7 team that looked capable with the ball but inept without it			0
unless @entity81 can improve his team defensively then the slump that followed the revival that followed the slump will continue indefinitely			0
to focus on that , however , would not only be rather depressing for the terrific @entity7 fans but also rather unfair on a @entity4 team guided imperiously round the field by @entity35 and laced with wonderful cameos from @entity44 and @entity39 and another excellent performance from the seemingly reborn @entity92			1
if the mark of a manager — at least in part — is how well players improve and perform on his watch then @entity71 is scoring highly at the moment			2
his team ’s defensive security still needs work but with the ball they were terrific			0
certainly @entity7 could and perhaps should have been in front early in the piece			0

@entity35 scored the opening goal of the game after 23 minutes - click here for more from our brilliant @entity149 service @entity35 then added his second goal of the game with nine minutes of the first - half remaining to double @entity4 's advantage @entity35 runs away with his arms outstretched after scoring for the home side against @entity7 in the 36th minute the @entity41 international slides on his knees in front of the @entity4 faithful after he extended the hosts ' lead in the @entity43 clash mins @entity164 @entity4 total 113.7 70.6 @entity44 90 11.7 7.3 @entity35 90 11.5 7.1 @entity92 90 10.9 6.8 @entity7 total 110.1 68.4 @entity121 90 11.4 7.1 @entity130 90 11.2 6.9 @entity127 90 10.9 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity166 , the @entity167 of the @entity168 for the first 15 minutes the lively @entity128 was the game ’s best player and he had already terrified @entity4 with one searing run from deep , and failed with a close - range volley , by the time the game ’s first real talking point arrived in the 14th minute			1
referee @entity106 — who has his critics — was in a perfect position to see @entity44 clip the heels of @entity131 as the path of the two men crossed but either blinked at the wrong moment or deemed the clear contact unintentional			2
whatever the case , he did n’t give a penalty and @entity4 were free to take full advantage by moving in to the lead shortly afterwards			1
even early on , it seemed @entity4 would win			1
there was something about @entity7 ’s defending that did n’t bode well from the start			0
every cross — many of which came from the left foot of @entity92 — seemed to cause a problem and @entity195 and @entity39 could have scored early had they connected with balls that seemed to evade @entity7 defenders rather unerringly			1
eventually , in the 24th minute , a goal arrived and it was terrific			0
@entity35 — dictating play like a rugby scrum - half — fed @entity44 and when the @entity204 ’s chipped pass reached @entity39 , peeling off his marker at the back post , the first time cut - back was perfect for @entity35 to score from six yards			1
in that instant , it was hard not to feel @entity7 were already done for			0
there was something about @entity4 that suggested they would n’t be denied and shortly after @entity39 failed to nudge in another @entity92 cross they added their second goal			1
this time it was a hospital pass from @entity131 to @entity128 that put @entity7 in trouble but it still took a determined tackle from @entity39 to allow @entity44 to play @entity35 clear in to the penalty area			1
the finish was applied first time			0
from then on , it was perhaps a case of ‘ how many ’ and surprisingly @entity4 only managed three			2
@entity220 @entity195 gave @entity4 a 3 - 0 lead with this header in front of the @entity224 after 53 minutes @entity113 celebrates his header with @entity39 , and the @entity4 faithful , as @entity12 's side cruised to a comfortable victory @entity133 converts from the penalty spot with only minutes remaining to hand @entity7 a consolation goal at @entity15 eight minutes into the second half , @entity35 ’s lofted pass from 40 yards found a huge hole between @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity113 applied a headed finish back across goal that was actually a lot harder than it looked			1
before the end , @entity7 did get their penalty			0
@entity240 clumsily upended @entity127 and substitute @entity133 converted high to @entity242 ’s left			0
this was not one of those afternoons that left @entity246 as a spectator for long spells			0
@entity4 have some way to go before they take us that far back in time			2
nevertheless , this looked like @entity4 ’s day from the get - go			1
to repeat , it ’s been a while since we have seen this			0
@entity92 skilfully eludes the challenge of @entity7 's @entity128 on the way to the 3 - 1 win star scorer @entity35 attempts to bend a free - kick over the @entity7 wall @entity123 ( left ) chases down @entity111 as the @entity4 midfielder looks to create an opportunity for the hosts			1

@entity35 opened the scoring for @entity4 after a fine assist by @entity39 with 23 mins gone
the @entity41 international then doubled his side 's advantage with his second of the afternoon 13 minutes later
@entity195 added his name to the *scoresheet* with a header shortly after the interval
the victory *cements* @entity4 's third - placed position in the @entity168 table , 10 points *adrift* of leaders @entity283
