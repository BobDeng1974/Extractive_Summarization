scars : doctors said they are treating dozens of young @entity1 injured during the violence at a hospital run by @entity21 - based @entity20 in @entity10 horrific : the images show the human cost of president @entity15 's ongoing brutal military crackdown against opposition it is seen as a remarkable statement from a body , which has turned against @entity15 because of its resentment of his ties to @entity72 , which was once known for keeping out of the internal affairs of its members			1
it is not clear whether its proposed joint @entity48 - @entity78 peacekeeping force would involve armed troops , or whether the aid offered to the opposition would include weapons			1
if so , it would be the second time in less than a year the @entity39 had called for outside intervention in an @entity78 state			2
its decision to back a no - fly zone in @entity90 last march led to @entity92 bombing that helped bring down @entity93			0
@entity44 , speaking after yesterday 's meeting , said he welcomed the formation of the @entity96 , which is expected to include exiled opposition leaders			1

mr @entity44 added : ' president @entity15 must be in no doubt of the determination of his neighbours and the international community to bring an end to the violence in @entity1			1
' @entity39 could not have sent a clearer message to @entity1 than the one it sent yesterday and we look forward to working closely with them in the coming days and weeks			1
' and he added today that any peacekeeping troops in @entity1 should come from non-western countries			2
he said : ' i do nâ€™t see the way forward in @entity1 as being @entity92 boots on the ground in any form , including in any peacekeeping form			1
' i think they would need to come from other countries , rather than @entity92 nations			0
of course , if such a concept can be made viable , we will be supporting it in all the usual ways			0
' mass movement : demonstrators gather to protest against president @entity15 in @entity161 , near @entity30 no end in sight : black smoke rises in the @entity30 district of @entity30 injured : rebels retreat after being hit with fire from army troops in @entity30 another victim : the dead body of a rebel is carried through the streets of @entity30 critical : @entity45 foreign secretary @entity44 said plans to send a joint @entity48 and @entity39 peacekeeping force in to @entity1 , once @entity15 stops the crackdown , must be discussed ' urgently ' in @entity30 yesterday , government troops concentrated their fire on @entity30 in the south of the city and @entity181 in the @entity182 , which borders the @entity183 , a main assembly point for tanks and government troops , opposition campaigners said			1
activist @entity187 said : ' @entity188 has been non-stop on @entity30 and the bombardment on @entity190 began overnight			0
' he said @entity181 , scene of large pro-democracy demonstrations for months , had come under attack in the last several days from @entity196 militia known as shabbiha			0
and he added : ' we heard the @entity126 has started responding by attacking roadblocks being manned by shabbiha			0
communications with @entity202 have been cut off and the sound of shelling can be now heard			0
' the @entity126 , led by defectors , has taken the main role in armed opposition to @entity15 's government			2
@entity1 's uprising , in which the @entity48 says more than 5,000 people have died , has become one of the bloodiest of the @entity213 revolts sweeping the region since the end of 2010			2
any peacekeeping mission would require consensus from foreign powers , who have been divided on how to resolve a conflict that is descending into a civil war			0
@entity222 and @entity223 drew strong criticism from the @entity182 after they prevented the @entity53 from backing an @entity78 plan that called for @entity15 to give up his powers			2
however , @entity92 powers so far have shown no appetite for military action , despite their condemnation of the repression of the uprising			0
shelling : in this online video , tanks fire in the @entity30 neighbourhood in the flashpoint city of @entity30 cowering : a group of blood - spattered children , with bandages on their heads , hide in the basement of a @entity30 home trying to avoid being caught in the bombardment @entity1 called the @entity39 's resolution ' a flagrant departure from the group 's charter and a hostile act that targets @entity1 's security and stability '			1
@entity15 's government says it is fighting an insurgency by militants funded from abroad , and @entity78 states have turned against it as part of a regional power grab			2

earlier yesterday , @entity268 said it would host the first meeting on february 24 of a ' friends of @entity1 ' contact group made up of @entity78 and other states and backed by the @entity182			1

bloodshed : more than 300 people including this man have died in @entity30 in the past week panic : citizens flee as a home in @entity30 is set on fire after being hit by a rocket victim : a woman in @entity30 , where activists say they are ' all going to die ' , stares vacantly after she was injured by @entity1 troops			2
