by @entity0 for @entity1 criminals have turned to @entity3 as a new way of making easy money , stealing and re-selling sets in a growing black market			0
police have made several large - scale busts involving @entity3 thefts in recent weeks , as criminals have become increasingly aware of the ease and speed at which the @entity15 toy can be sold online			2
the toys also quickly increase in value , and like @entity18 , are difficult to trace			0
police are regularly uncovering large - scale @entity3 thefts as criminals increasingly become aware of the ease in which the toy can be on - sold , their increasing value and the fact they are largely untraceable ; the above picture is of 18 - pallets of @entity3 seized during a recent raid on the @entity27 , @entity28 home of @entity29 @entity30 , who legally sells sets of @entity3 on @entity32 in his spare time , said it makes ' total sense ' that thieves would turn to the toy to make easy money @entity37 , 53 , was this week charged with grand larceny after allegedly snatching 800 sets of the toy - worth £ 35,000 - from a @entity42 , @entity43 , collector before trying to sell them on @entity45 , @entity40 reported			1
less than 48 - hours later , in @entity48 , @entity27 , police arrested four people in connection with £ 24,000 worth of @entity3 stolen from toy stores			2
they also found £ 120,000 of @entity3 merchandise - 18 pallets worth - in one of the suspects ' homes and in a storage facility			2
in @entity48 , earlier this month , police arrested @entity57 , 35 , @entity58 , 33 , and @entity59 , 34 , who were allegedly stealing the most valuable @entity3 sets they could find , before passing them on to @entity29 , 40 , who is believed to have sold them online			0
in a more elaborate example of the crime , last year police arrested @entity64 who made his own bar codes which he then placed on @entity3 sets so he could buy them at a cheaper price			1
@entity58 , 33 @entity59 , 34 @entity29 , 40 police found hundreds of sets of stolen @entity3 in the @entity71 tech executives home			1
earlier this year thieves in @entity74 used angle grinders and crowbars to steal a haul of the toy from four separate retailers , and in @entity81 thieves have struck @entity3 trucks before the toy could even reach stores			0
in almost every case , the stolen @entity3 is sold online , where limited edition sets - like those linked to movies - can fetch several thousand pounds			0
@entity30 , who legally sells sets of @entity3 on @entity32 in his spare time , told the website it makes ' total sense ' that thieves would turn to the toy to make easy money .			1

during a bust police found 18 - *pellets* of @entity3 at one alleged thief *'s* home
' @entity100 ' have used their own bar codes to buy the toy at cheaper prices
@entity3 seller @entity30 said it makes ' total sense ' why the toy is stolen
