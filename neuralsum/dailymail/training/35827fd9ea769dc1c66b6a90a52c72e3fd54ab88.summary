still , with a little help from actress @entity8 the @entity6 managed to pull off a billion euro charity deal today			1
the actress giggled her way through the event with the @entity6 as the pair worked the phones			1
shrugging her shoulders in bewilderment as she juggled phones on the trading floor , @entity15 admitted she was utterly flummoxed as fancy dress - clad brokers frantically traded around her			1
deal : @entity15 , @entity6 and @entity23 actress @entity8 took part in the @entity25 got the giggles : @entity15 and @entity8 seemed to enjoy themselves , as did tv presenter @entity28 fair trade : actress @entity8 appeared to be getting into the spirit of things as she worked the phones @entity34 judge , @entity33 , also helped with the day and the @entity6 joked with him as they tried to work out what to do			1
turning to mr @entity33 , whom she has known for many years through their shared charity work , she said : ' i have no idea whatsoever what i am meant to be doing ! ' the @entity43 - born choreographer just laughed and said : ' @entity45 , it ’s all gorgeous , let ’s just do this ! ' in the end they did – doing a deal for a ' yard ' of euros , trading slang for one billion - which netted £ 23,000 for charities the @entity6 supports			1
broker @entity55 said afterwards : ' it was huge deal , five times the size of our usual deal , and normally takes days to set up			2
she was a good sport			2
' @entity15 was on the trading floor of @entity63 firm @entity25 , a leading markets operator			1
each year it gives away all its revenue and commissions on a chosen day to charity and since 1993 has raised £ 100 million worldwide			1
@entity15 agreed to take part this year as donations will this year be made to two organisations of which she is patron			0
london calling : the @entity6 and @entity33 man the phones during the deal definitely 10 points ! @entity33 looks thrilled as he realises that he 's made £ 23,000 for charity @entity76 , which provides emergency shelter and supplies to families made homeless by disaster or conflict , including current victims of @entity83 in the @entity84 , and the @entity85 , the only @entity23 - wife charity dedicated to the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of the fragile bone disease			1
the royal ’s mother and grandmother both died from the debilitating condition			0
dressed in a smart blue tweed suit and pearls , the @entity6 took the hustle and bustle of the floor in her stride and did n’t bat an eyelid at the often outlandish fancy dress outfits that the brokers wore for the day			0
she happily posed for photographs with gladiators , killer clowns , basketball players and even a team of @entity112 entrants – whatever that may be			0
down at the i - swap @entity114 , she roared as she was greeted by two female financiers wearing inflatable sumo outfits and bikinis and even tried her hand at their interactive surfing game ( although she declined the proffered glass of @entity121 and pineapple )			2
surprise ! the @entity125 dealer at the other end of the phone was surprised to find himself talking to @entity15 unusual : some of the brokers had arrived in fancy dress , including this pair of female sumo wrestlers after conducting a dollar swap with the @entity6 , broker @entity133 said : ' she did well			2
she seemed a little nervous but probably not as nervous as i am			0
' emerging markets broker @entity137 also helped @entity15 with another deal and added : ' she ’s just dealt with @entity140 and closed a trade , superbly , i might add , with a lot of style and panache			2
' other celebrities on the floor included @entity148 actor @entity147 and @entity8 , who also campaigns for the @entity85			1
@entity15 told the actress : ' i ’ve not idea what we are doing but will try to do my best			0
' @entity8 replied : ' nor have i , we could get into trouble you know			1
' speaking afterwards mr @entity33 , who is a patron of the @entity85 , said the @entity6 had been ' huge fun '			0
spooky : a surprisingly cheerful skeleton watched as @entity15 took on a @entity125 broker in @entity140 colourful : other workers , dressed as hippies , waited by the @entity25 front entrance to greet @entity15 ' i could n’t quite believe what we were doing or the figure we were talking about			2
i had to borrow a red studded glove from one of the brokers as my hand was shaking and sweating so much that i could n’t hold the phone , ' he said			0
the @entity34 judge , who has just undergone hip replacement surgery at the age of just 48 , added of his condition : ' thankfully i appear to be recovering well			1
' it seems as if i have a touch of osteoarthritis , which is interesting giving the work the @entity6 and i do , but i did a few spins last week and although i was a bit worried about it , thankfully my hip did n’t pop out			0
' i ’m now in rehearsals for panto			0
things seem to be going well			0
