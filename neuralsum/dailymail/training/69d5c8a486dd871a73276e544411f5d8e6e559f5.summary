by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 17:31 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 03:06 est , 23 july 2013 mother nature : despite her trim bump , the @entity3 was blooming in the later stages of her pregnancy the @entity7 and @entity3 of @entity9 ’s baby son is the heaviest future king to be born in recent history			1
the as - yet - unnamed boy weighed a hefty 8lb 6oz when he was safely delived yesterday afternoon			1
his father @entity13 weighed 7lb 1.5oz when he arrived in 1982 , while his grandfather the @entity14 weighed 7lb 6oz when he was born in 1948			1
the @entity15 was born by caesarean section in her maternal grandparents ’ @entity19 home in april 1926			0
at the time , she was third in line to the throne , but her weight was not announced			2
the average weight of a baby born close to its due date is around 8lb 2.5oz ( 3.7 kilos ) , but @entity3 was overdue			1
@entity27 , a social historian at @entity28 , said that in the past , birth weights of monarchs were not revealed			2
the newest member of the @entity32 , however , will have the details of his arrival pored over by a worldwide audience			0
she said the baby prince was a ‘ respectable weight ’ and added : ‘ it ’s not champion or a 9lb or 10lb , which would be eyebrow - raising			1
’ ‘ what it certainly shows is that this is a baby of healthy parents			2
he ’s definitely got more weight than his father and grandfather did			2
‘ i doubt we were told the birth weights of previous monarchs			2
‘ i ’m pretty certain we were n’t for @entity51 and @entity52			0
that kind of information would have been seen as very private detail			0
‘ before , it was enough to know that the child was born alive and healthy			0
after that , the bulletins would go very quiet			0
’ prince @entity60 weighed 6lb 14oz when he was born in 1984			1
@entity13 ’s cousin , lady @entity61 , was born prematurely weighing 4lb 9oz in 2004 , while @entity61 ’s brother @entity62 , arrived in 2007 weighing 6lb 2oz			1
the @entity15 ’s first great - grandchild @entity63 was just slightly heavier than @entity13 and @entity3 ’s new baby son and arrived weighing 8lb 8oz in december 2010			1
the monarch ’s second great - grandchild @entity65 , born in march last year , weighed 7lb 4oz			1
the prince of @entity9 ’s birthweight falls within the current healthy range of six to nine pounds – and is close to perfect given the extra time in the womb and the inheritance factor of tall , healthy parents			2
the average weight of newborn babies is 7lb 8ozs , with lighter babies being classified small for gestational age ( @entity77 ) or of low birthweight			1
babies classified as large for gestational age ( @entity80 ) weigh more than expected compared with the time spent in the womb , around nine pounds and over , according to fetal growth charts			0
the new arrival ’s weight will be satisfying for both parents and doctors , and is probably slightly more than expected because he was overdue			1
larger than normal babies are not only difficult to deliver but may herald health problems in later life			0
scientific evidence suggests they may be more prone to obesity , diabetes and heart problems when they grow up			0
similarly , although small babies are easy to deliver there may be developmental problems linked to size as countless studies on premature babies have shown			0
the growth of the new royal will have been closely monitored by scans throughout @entity3 ’s pregnancy , because failure to thrive in the womb rings alarm bells , suggesting the placenta is not working properly			1
@entity111 , professor of obstetrics at @entity113 , @entity19 and adviser to @entity116 ’s baby charity , said the newborn ’s weight was ‘ spot - on normal ’			1
facts and figures : royal aide @entity121 leaves @entity123 's hospital with the official announcement that the @entity126 ' son has been born and the essential details of the bouncing boy another healthy boy : prince @entity13 weighed in 7lb 1.5oz at when he was born in 1982 ( pictured in the arms of his mother @entity131 and @entity14 ) he said : ‘ we take into account the ethnicity of the mother , her height and weight and whether it is the first - born – they tend to be a little smaller than children born subsequently			1
' this child is well within the normal range for birthweight that we would hope to see			0
’ as a summer - born baby , however , the newest royal will be one of the youngest in his class , which could put him at a disadvantage early on			2
a july birthday will mean that the new prince of @entity9 will start school not long after he turns four			0
summer - born pupils tend to battle with confidence in their academic abilities			0
however , they are also said to have a strong belief in controlling their own destiny – not be surprising for a child who will learn early on in his life that he will one day become @entity159 .			0

prince @entity13 weighed 7lb 1.5oz and @entity14 was 7lb 6oz at birth
*tradition* of revealing royal baby 's weight is a relatively new one
