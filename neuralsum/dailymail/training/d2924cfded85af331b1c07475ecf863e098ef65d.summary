@entity12 's family , including his wife , @entity22 , say the boy 's death was a tragic accident , and not murder			1

when he went back the second time , @entity12 noticed that the boy 's condition had gotten worse - he was unresponsive , @entity12 told investigators , so he washed him off in a bathtub and then took him to the hospital			1
at the hospital , ' @entity12 could not provide an explanation ' for the boy 's injuries			1

' @entity6 : @entity12 currently works as a specialist on the @entity149 for the @entity6 however , @entity12 's attorney , @entity150 , said in court tuesday that medical tests performed at the hospital do n't support the findings in the autopsy			1
' there was a full ct scan done of @entity40 , and there were no skull fractures , ' he said			0
@entity12 and his wife had to work through @entity161 to qualify to adopt a child with special needs			2
because of his honorable military background and current job with the @entity6 , in october the couple was told they could adopt @entity40			2
