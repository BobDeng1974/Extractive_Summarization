receiving a bouquet of flowers at work is one of the top five most desired gestures surprises may be the key to everyday happiness , according to new research			2
two thirds ( 64 per cent ) of @entity10 say thoughtful gestures make their day			1
and more than half ( 51 per cent ) say that when someone does something nice for them , it makes them feel loved			1
the nation 's top five surprises include being cooked for , being made a cup of tea and a surprise note or letter left under a pillow			2
more than two fifths ( 43 per cent ) believe it puts them in a good mood for hours , and a quarter of us ( 27 per cent ) say it has a ' pass it on ' effect on us			1
we feel the urge to do something good and make a surprise gesture for someone else as a result			1
even just a surprise mug of tea can evoke the same feelings of positivity and happiness as a grand gesture like an extravagant gift			2
eight in ten ( 81 per cent ) of the population say they would feel just as pleased with a warm cup of tea			2
professor @entity48 , consultant clinical psychologist at @entity49 , commented on the findings			0
' psychologists have studied the positive effect of pleasant surprises for many years , ' he said			0
' what they have found is that when something delightful and unexpected happens it gives people a real boost			0
' pleasant surprises have a biological effect , a psychological effect and a social effect			0
' and because emotional states are contagious , when a surprise makes someone happy then their friends , family and colleagues also benefit , so a surprise for one person really can ' spread a little happiness '			1
' the survey also revealed that we 're a generous nation			0
more than three quarters of people ( 77 per cent ) have received a surprise in the last six months , with the majority coming from romantic partners			0
furthermore , two thirds ( 65 per cent ) have performed a spontaneous gesture for someone ' just because ' during the last month , proving you do n't have to wait for an occasion to give a special surprise			1
someone completing a household chore before you come home from work is also popular 1 ) someone cooking a surprise meal when i get home from work ( 24 per cent ) 2 ) being made an unexpected cup of tea on a bad day ( 17 per cent ) 3 ) a surprise note or letter tucked into a bag , or under a pillow ( 16 per cent ) 4 ) someone completing a household chore for me before i come home from work ( 15 per cent ) 5 ) receiving a bouquet of flowers at work ( 11 per cent ) when it comes to giving , 45 per cent said that performing a spontaneous gesture for someone makes them feel good with a further 40 per cent saying it makes them feel like they have done their good deed for the day			1
nearly half ( 45 per cent ) of people also said they felt happier giving treats rather than receiving them ( 12 per cent )			1
however , it 's not all good news			0
one in five ( 20 per cent ) admit a lack of desire to take part in any spontaneous gestures , so it comes as no surprise that a third of us believe nice gestures are on the decline compared to a decade ago			2
the majority of people attribute this decline to the pressure people feel to spend money on expensive gestures , a lack of time and laziness			0
