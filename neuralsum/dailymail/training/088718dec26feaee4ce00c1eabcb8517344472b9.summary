@entity0 thought she was dying			1
lying in the back of an ambulance , she was struggling for breath , in agony and unable to feel her feet			1
she began to panic that her body was shutting down			1
‘ it was horrible , ’ she says			1
‘ i just remember looking into these really bright lights in the ambulance and thinking : “ i ’m too young ”			1
’ an hour earlier she had been descending on her bike on a rain - soaked road in south @entity13			1
it was part of a training regime designed to give her the endurance to secure a second @entity19 gold			1
she won gold in 2012 in the team pursuit with @entity22 and @entity23 and is looking for a repeat in @entity25 in 2016			1
olympic cyclist @entity0 ( left ) admits she thought she was close to death after a training accident @entity0 posted @entity29 images of her recovery that saw her left with eight broken ribs and a punctured lung the 24 - year - old gives a thumbs up from her hospital bed holding her @entity36 but a rider to her left hit a pothole at more than 30mph and lost control , taking @entity0 with him as he hit the tarmac			1
riding behind her was a former rugby player weighing over 16 stone			1
unable to avoid the 24 - year - old , his front wheel rammed into @entity0 ’s side before he too was thrown off his bike			1
the impact left @entity0 with eight broken ribs and a punctured lung			1
had a bone fragment damaged another organ it could have been far more serious			2
even so , she had to spend two days in intensive care and a further 10 on a ward			2
sitting here in a @entity60 hotel only 10 days after she was discharged from hospital , it is hard to believe this is the same person			2
she seems fit and well , not a scratch on view , even if she admits to feeling apprehensive about getting back on a bike on the road			1
‘ we were about 100km into the ride , ’ she says			2
‘ it was really bad weather , raining and cold			2
we were riding two abreast and a guy to my left hit a pothole and fell right into the group			2
i just hit him and went over my bars			2
a rider behind me rode into by back			2
that ’s what did the damage really			2
’ @entity0 thinks it was an hour before the first ambulance arrived			1
‘ when they did arrive there were two people with head injuries who needed help first , ’ she says			2
‘ they were discharged later that day , but it meant i was the last to get in an ambulance			2
‘ it was carnage , horrible			2
i was in the road for over an hour , cold in the rain			2
i was aware straight away that i ’d done something to my lung			1
i could only take the tiniest breaths			2
and i could feel my ribs grinding together			1
‘ i went into survival mode			2
i was n’t crying , i was in so much pain , but because i knew i ’d done something serious i realised i needed to stay calm and get the oxygen into my lung			1
’ @entity0 rides to victory in the women 's @entity107 at the @entity108 in @entity60 @entity0 celebrates winning gold and breaking the world record with team - mates @entity22 and @entity23 a shot of morphine enabled the paramedics to lift her on to a spinal board and into the ambulance			1
the mother of her boyfriend , the fellow professional cyclist @entity119 , had driven to the scene after receiving a phone call and joined her in the ambulance			0
‘ i genuinely thought i was going to die , ’ she says			1
‘ i could n’t feel my feet , and while they ’d given me all the painkillers i could have i just could n’t breathe			0
there was a scary moment in casualty too			0
my heart rate went from 50 to 150 in a split second			0
the doctors told @entity119 and his mum to leave the room and pulled the curtains round and called the doctor			0
thankfully it must have just been a bit of shock			0
’ a scan revealed the collapsed lung			1
‘ i had to go straight into theatre to have a chest drain put in , ’ she says			0
‘ they put the drain — this tube the width of a hosepipe — into the lung to remove the liquid and re-inflate the lung			1
and i had to have an epidural too because they said i would n’t be able to deal with the pain			0
’ she has proved a fast healer , and the doctors have said she will make a complete recovery			0
but some mental scars remain			0
‘ when i was on the floor i said , “ i ’m never going to ride a bike again ” , ’ she says			0
‘ i was thinking , “ is this actually worth it ? ” but it was n’t long before i thought , “ no , i will ”			1
@entity0 has admitted she contemplated quitting the sport after the life - threatening accident @entity0 ( left ) leads the field in the @entity168 during the @entity169 ‘ that said , i will probably still be a bit worried about getting on a bike again			1
i would n’t be human if i was n’t			0
i have suffered a significant trauma and it happened riding a bike			0
‘ my liver was bruised			0
the consultant told me that if one of the pieces of bone had become dislodged i would have had a 50 per cent chance of living			0
i was shown a 3d image of my bones			0
‘ i will find it hard getting back on the bike on the road			0
especially in groups , in bad weather			0
‘ i ’m sure it will come back ( her confidence on the bike )			0
it ’s going to have to			0
@entity119 and i are planning to go on holiday somewhere warm where i can just ride and enjoy it			0
‘ then when i come back i ’ll start on my training plan , the aim being january 1 ( the accident was on november 6 )			1
it might mean i miss a couple of early - season races but it wo n’t disrupt anything			1
’ @entity0 makes a point about the state of @entity205 ’s roads , and the fact that other countries do invest more in cycling			1
something like £ 2 per person in this country , according to the national cycling charity @entity211 , compared to £ 35 in @entity212 and @entity213			1
the pothole that caused the accident was a monster , measuring one foot long , almost a foot wide and two inches deep			1
‘ we do a lot of training in @entity221 and i do n’t think i ’ve ever needed to shout “ pothole ” , ’ she says			0
king ( centre ) celebrates with her team - mates after winning gold at the 2013 @entity227 @entity0 is now looking ahead to repeating her @entity19 success at the 2016 @entity19 in @entity25 but her focus is now very much on the future			1
on more success , and more @entity19 gold			1
‘ i hope this experience makes me stronger , ’ she says			0
‘ i ca n’t just sit at home and cry			0
i have cried , do n’t get me wrong			0
‘ and i ’m still struggling to sleep , because i ’m injured on the side i sleep — on my right			0
but i also feel i ’m lucky			0
‘ in intensive care i was the only one who was conscious			0
i could see there were lots of people an awful lot worse off than me			0
‘ winning gold in @entity60 was the pinnacle for a lot of top sports people but i am really determined			1
‘ i want to make @entity248			0
this is just another setback , another bump in the road			0
if i do make it , it will make the journey that bit more special			0
