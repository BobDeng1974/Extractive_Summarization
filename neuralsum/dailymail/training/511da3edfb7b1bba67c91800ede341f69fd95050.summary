the heart - warming first encounter shows six - month - old cubs @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 full of youthful intrigue as they bound towards their dad hoping he wanted to play			1
despite appearing withdrawn at first , 500lb @entity19 quickly got used to his young triplets bouncing around him with their mother @entity21 nearby in their predators of the @entity24 habitat in @entity25 , @entity26			2
and aware of his new role he was quick to ensure they knew who was boss - giving them a gentle roar if they overstepped the mark or a light pat with his paw to calm them down			0
senior keeper for the zoo 's @entity40 section @entity42 said : ' we were confident that @entity19 would be tolerant of his cubs right away and we 're glad we were right because the cubs rushed him as soon as they saw him			1
' at first he was surprised but as time passed he grew more patient			1
