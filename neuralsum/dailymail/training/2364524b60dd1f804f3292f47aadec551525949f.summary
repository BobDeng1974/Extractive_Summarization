but mr @entity0 , 47 , told a @entity32 audience that the 83 - year - old author should not be so upset about a ‘ name being on a list ’			1
he added that 600,000 dead @entity7 have now received posthumous baptisms from the @entity2			1

' this controversy just seems like it will not die - and , if it did , the @entity2 would posthumously baptise it ' @entity0 mr @entity0 claimed he was given the power to do this by renting @entity50 , the 1983 @entity52 film about a @entity7 girl disguised as a boy			2
