the @entity0 and @entity1 may have witnessed a curtain - raiser for the spectacular @entity4 meteor shower			1
what looked like a fireball was caught on camera racing across the sky in broad daylight across western @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity1 , just a day before the @entity4 event takes place			1
two car dashboard - mounted cameras filmed the object , with the footage subsequently uploaded to @entity18			1
light fantastic : a police dash - cam captured what appears to be a fireball streaking across the sky above @entity1 now you see it , now you do n't : the object was gone in a split second , but witnesses said its brightness rivalled that of the sun a very bright light appears against the blue sky , then quickly vanishes			1
some people reported hearing an explosion as the ball of light streaked away from them			2
the @entity40 is urging members of the public to submit reports of the fireball to it			1
spectacular : the @entity47 , seen here over @entity49 in 2013 , takes place when the earth dissects the debris trail of @entity53 goodness gracious : the great ball of fire 's trajectory , according to the @entity40 here we sort through the space rubble and explain the different sorts of rock floating around in the solar system			1
@entity62 are fragments from the formation of the solar system 4.6billion years ago and can range in size from half a mile to hundreds of miles wide			0
they generally lurk between @entity68 and @entity69			0
@entity70 too are also leftovers from the formation of the solar system and are made up of ice , rock , dust and frozen gases , with the core being up to 40 miles in diameter			0
they can leave a spectacular trail that 's hundreds of millions of miles long as they orbit the sun. @entity84 are the result of asteroid collisions or comets breaking up			1
@entity88 are meteoroids that burn up as they enter the @entity92 's atmosphere			0
meteoritesmeteors that survive the fiery entry to earth and hit the ground			0
it said that judging from initial reports , the object had a brightness rivalling that of the sun. the @entity4 meteor shower is created as the @entity92 passes through the debris trail of @entity53 , according to @entity104 , and this year it peaks between may 5 and 6			1
about 30 meteors will be visible an hour in the northern hemisphere and around 60 per hour in the southern hemisphere			0
@entity104 explained that the objects in the debris trail are moving at around 148,000mph			0
to view the @entity47 , @entity104 suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights , prepared with a sleeping bag , blanket or chair			0
‘ lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up , taking in as much of the sky as possible , ’ the space agency advises			2
‘ after about 30 minutes in the dark , your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors			0
be patient - the show will last until dawn , so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse			2
’ @entity130 astronomer @entity129 said : ‘ what makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history , @entity53			2
‘ as @entity53 goes around the sun in its 76 - year orbit , pieces of it , little chunks of ice , slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time , in early may			2
