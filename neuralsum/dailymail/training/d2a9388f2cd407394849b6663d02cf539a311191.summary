the @entity1 @entity0 is set to win its first parliamentary seat tomorrow as voters were poised to deliver a bloody nose to both the @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity7 , the former @entity8 mp who defected to @entity0 this summer is expected to hold his seaside constituency of @entity10 in @entity11 by a landslide			1
polls have put him on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the @entity8 , in what is set to be a humiliating by - election defeat for @entity18			1
but @entity0 , who have made political capital out of child abuse scandals in nearby @entity35 and @entity36 and fears about immigration , are set to run them a close second , which would raise more concerns about @entity43 's leadership			2
mr @entity18 has all but conceded the @entity8 can not win @entity10 , which has high unemployment and contains the most deprived ward in the country			2
the prime minister made a last ditch visit to the seat last week , and acknowledged the @entity5 were ' the underdogs '			2
the conservative candidate fighting mr @entity7 is @entity51 , an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the @entity54 ' , who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years			2
a few cabinet ministers and mps have visited the seaside town in recent weeks to campaign , but the party largely held back in order to throw more resources at the next by - election in @entity65 and @entity66 , in @entity67 , next month triggered by the defection of fellow @entity8 mp @entity69			2
mr @entity69 has a small lead in the polls , but the @entity8 believe they can hold it , and will head there on friday afternoon after the @entity10 result to campaign			2
mr @entity18 said they would ' throw everything we can ' at keeping the seat			0
securing the first seat in the @entity80 will mark a major breakthrough for @entity0 , with leader @entity82 hoping it will act as a springboard for other wins at the general election @entity8 candidate @entity51 , a former actor in 1980s sitcom bread , was joined on the campaign rail today by cabinet office minister @entity89 @entity6 have approached the northern by - election tonight with increasing panic amid concerns that @entity43 is not in touch with the voters about immigration			1
one mp said yesterday that if @entity0 finished within 2,000 votes of @entity6 there ' alarm bells would start ringing ' about mr @entity43			1
the mp , who did not wish to be named , said it would suggest that the direction of the party ' was not one that was appealing to our core voters '			0
a study last week found that the @entity0 surge could prevent @entity6 taking dozens of @entity8 target seats at the next election			1
@entity109 , @entity6 mp for @entity110 , said @entity6 was not doing enough to address the @entity0 threat in many northern , working - class seats			1
mr @entity109 said : ' @entity6 needs to squeeze the space that @entity0 is trying to squeeze into , which is attracting low - paid working class voters and their concerns , which are pay , immigration and the @entity118			1
if we do n't , we wo n't win â€“ it 's as simple as that			0
' ' that voice is n't represented in @entity6 's policies			0
it 's a fundamental weakness and if @entity43 wants to become prime minister he needs to address that			0
' @entity0 are also hoping for a strong showing in the by - election in @entity27 and @entity28 , where @entity82 campaigned yesterday , climbing on to a tank for the cameras @entity43 met local people today in @entity27 , where @entity6 is expected to win the by - election triggered by the death of @entity6 mp @entity31 senior labour mp @entity136 said all mainstream parties are set to be punished at the ballot box , because they are not listening to real people 's concerns			1
mrs @entity136 , mp for @entity143 , which caused shockwaves in 2006 by electing a dozen @entity147 councillors said : ' people are moving away to @entity0 , the @entity147 or the @entity148 as a protest vote against the mainstream political parties not connecting with the electorate			0
@entity152 is in danger of breaking down			0
' @entity67 and @entity11 are key areas where @entity6 must pick up marginal seats if they want to win the next general election			0
but in @entity10 , which @entity6 held under @entity158 with different boundaries when it was known as @entity160 , their vote is set to be squeezed by @entity0			1
@entity6 managed to poll 25 per cent of the vote in @entity10 in 2010 at the height of @entity164 's unpopularity and their vote share is predicted to drop this time			1
yesterday , local councillor @entity167 claimed yesterday that immigration is ' not an issue ' in the area ' in terms of numbers ' as there are few migrants there			0
he added : ' i think it 's being stoked up a bit by what @entity0 are saying			0
but it is n't the first issue that comes up on the doorstep			0
that 's been the @entity118 and street lights			0

@entity0 on course to deliver a bloody nose to the conservatives and @entity6
by - elections being held in @entity10 and in @entity27 and @entity28
polls suggest @entity7 will beat @entity5 in @entity10 by up to 6,000 votes
@entity6 expected to cling on in @entity27 , but with @entity0 hot on their heels
