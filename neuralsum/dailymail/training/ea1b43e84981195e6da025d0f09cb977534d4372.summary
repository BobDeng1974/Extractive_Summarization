by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 13 april 2013 saint to sinner ? @entity2 , pictured kneeling among @entity5 's orphans , has come in for criticism from the country 's president bumping along a red dirt road in one of the world ’s poorest countries last week , a cavalcade of six luxury four - by - fours eventually came to a halt outside a ramshackle school			1
it was an entrance you would expect of a visiting head of state			0
but , instead , the bird - like figure of @entity2 emerged from the back of the lead car , hair scraped back and hands still moist from the anti-bacterial gel she had applied seconds earlier			1
moments later , she was posing for photographers in the centre of a group of beaming children at the @entity33 primary school in rural @entity5 , her image as billionaire pop diva swapped for that of @entity38 and international humanitarian			0
but if the singer thought her four - day trip to the @entity43 state would highlight the school - building programme she helps fund — plus offer some worthwhile personal pr — she was sorely mistaken			2
instead , as a result of her so - called ‘ goodwill mission ’ to the poverty - stricken country , the @entity47 finds herself at the centre of an ongoing diplomatic incident that threatens to tarnish her image as @entity54 of @entity5			0
she has been accused by the nation ’s female president of exploiting her aid work for personal publicity , overplaying her charity ’s achievements and of reneging on her promise to build a £ 10 million state - of - the - art academy for poor schoolgirls			1
in an unprecedented attack , president @entity64 also accused the singer — who adopted two of her four children from @entity5 — of ‘ making the poor dance for her ’			1
in a final slight , the star and her entourage were made to queue with economy passengers before flying out of the capital @entity74 this week			0
a statement issued by president @entity64 ’s office claimed @entity2 had bullied state officials and demanded vip treatment			1
it read : ‘ if [ ... ] because she is an internationally - renowned star , @entity2 believes she deserves to be treated differently from other visiting foreigners , it is worth making her aware that @entity5 has hosted many international stars , including @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature			1
’ more than meets the eye : @entity2 , with her adopted two children @entity95 , right and @entity96 , left , has been accused of ' patronising arrogance ' president @entity64 has since said that she did not approve the statement , but has offered no apology			1
relations have been further soured by a scrawled , and mis - spelled letter 54 - year - old @entity2 wrote to mrs @entity64 , belatedly requesting an audience			1
to make matters worse , the note was sent days after the star ’s people had hinted that @entity2 might not be able to grace the country ’s leader with her time			1
and if that were not enough , @entity2 ’s charity chief , @entity110 , has caused outrage by accusing @entity5 government officials of corruption on @entity115			2
meanwhile , the country ’s education minister has poured scorn on claims that @entity2 ’s charity , @entity120 , has built ten new schools for 4,800 children			1
‘ the schools were already in existence , ’ says @entity123			0
‘ it is classrooms that @entity2 has donated			2
they have built ten classroom blocks			0
it is helpful , but it is a long shot to call it significant			0
’ @entity2 ’s spokesman says that without her involvement , children at the schools would be taught ‘ under trees ’ and denies that the star requested vip treatment			1
not impressed : @entity64 , president of @entity5 , has spoken out against the demands and attitude of @entity2 given that @entity5 relies almost totally on aid and @entity2 was once said to be its biggest individual benefactor , it is remarkable that the country has turned on her with such vehemence			1
but behind this bitter pr war are accusations of wasted millions , an obsession with self - publicity and a grudge over the singer sacking president @entity64 ’s sister as the head of her @entity43 charity			1
there are also claims that , despite insistence that her two @entity5 children , @entity161 , seven , and @entity162 , eight — whom she adopted in 2006 and 2009 respectively — would remain in touch with their roots , they have been kept away from family members in the country			1
@entity161 and @entity162 took centre stage last week as @entity2 and her natural children @entity169 , 16 , and @entity170 , 12 , toured the schools she helped fund			1
yet @entity162 ’s uncle , @entity173 , says he was not told of the trip or given a chance to see his niece			0
he was left shuttling between the department of social welfare and the @entity180 orphanage , where @entity162 was placed as a baby , trying in vain to find her			0
‘ i was not told they were coming and i have spent every day trying without success to see @entity162 again , ’ he complained			0
mood swing : @entity2 appears in good spirits as she greets @entity5 locals here - but she has been accused of behaving inappropriately by senior officials likewise , since @entity2 adopted @entity161 , there have been angry claims that the boy ’s @entity5 relatives have been edited out of his life			1
@entity161 was placed in the home of @entity197 orphanage , in the western district of @entity199 , after his mother died following his birth in 2005			2
his father , @entity202 , 39 , no relation to the country ’s president , was supportive of the adoption			2
but now he says he believed his son would be returned home to him after being educated in @entity209			0
in a rare meeting in 2009 , @entity161 apparently did not recognise his father			1
more recently , mr @entity95 has been talking about being ‘ cheated ’ out of seeing his son grow up			0
certainly , he was nowhere to be seen during last week ’s trip as @entity161 posed for a series of photos , including kissing babies at the orphanage where he once lived			2
however , there was talk of @entity2 allowing @entity161 to meet his biological father last friday , a day before she and her entourage flew back to @entity209 on a private @entity222 jet			1
it is not known if the meeting took place			0
part of the anger within @entity5 is centred around the fact that senior members of the government believe the @entity47 reneged on a deal that allowed her to adopt the two children in first place			0
bit of a difference : @entity2 has claimed she ' built ' a number of schools , whereas officials state that she actually constructed a number of ' classrooms ' they waived strict rules that state @entity242 have to be resident in the country for at least 18 months before adopting			2
but a blind eye was turned because of the star ’s promise to build the 400 - bed @entity248 through her @entity120 charity , backed by the @entity251 in @entity252			0
the allegation is that after promising the £ 10 million project , @entity2 is now doing her charity work on the cheap			1
raising @entity5 and @entity256 , did not actually build any of the schools she visited			0
that job was done by @entity209 charity @entity259 , which has been erecting two - room schools in the state for 20 years			0
in fact , @entity2 closed the offices of both her charities in @entity74 in 2011			2
according to the @entity266 , which oversees her charity work , the singer has donated $ 400,000 ( £ 260,000 ) to @entity259			0
given that the charity ’s annual income is in the region of $ 9 million ( £ 5.8 million ) , @entity2 is a fairly minor contributor			2
significantly , the woman she appointed to run @entity120 , @entity273 , is the sister of president @entity64			1
in 2011 , @entity2 sacked mrs @entity275 and seven of the charity ’s executive committee after discovering a black hole in its accounts			2
it was claimed that @entity275 and her staff frittered away £ 2.4 million on cars and golf membership before a brick had even been laid			0
however , staff insist the perks were written into their contracts			0
none of which is much of a return on the £ 7 million @entity2 has personally pumped into @entity5 since her first visit in 2006			2
whatever the truth , the @entity47 ’s reputation as the self - styled saviour of @entity43 has taken something of a dent .			0

accused of exploiting her work for personal publicity
president @entity64 claims she makes ' the poor dance for her '
also claims @entity2 demands vip treatment wherever she goes
natural father of her adopted son @entity161 claims to have been *prevented* from seeing him
