by @entity0 published : 20:53 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 21 june 2013 it 's every shopper 's worst nightmare , driving around in circles looking for somewhere to park and then having to squeeze into a small gap between two other cars			2
but it seems that @entity9 car firm @entity8 has finally solved that problem			0
the @entity12 - based manufacturer has unveiled new self - parking valet technology that lets the car do all the work for you – without the driver even having to be inside the car			0
the smart , driver-less car also reacts safely and smoothly with other cars and pedestrians in the car park			1
the driver simply gets out of the car and instructs it to find a space via their smart phone and it will follow their command			1
like something out of @entity63 , when the driver returns to the vehicle they simply use their smart phone again to alert the system , and it will start the engine and come right to the driver of its own accord			1
@entity8 ’s ingenious autonomous parking system will undergo public trials next week			1
safe : the new technology uses sensors so that it is able to see when pedestrians are walking in its vicinity and stops to let them walk by clever : the car will even spot when another car is vacating a space and nip into it perfect parking : the car 's sensors enable it to park perfectly in the centre of the empty bay @entity93 , senior safety adviser for the @entity94 said : ‘ @entity95 is a technology that relieves the driver of the time - consuming task of finding a vacant parking space			1
' the driver just drops the vehicle off at the entrance to the car park and picks it up in the same place later			2
’ he explained : ‘ transmitters in the road infrastructure tell the driver when the service is available			0
the driver then uses a mobile phone application to activate the @entity95 and walks away from the car			0
‘ the car users sensors to pin - point its position and navigate to a free parking space			0
fetch : when the driver returns to the car , they simply instruct the vehicle 's technology to pick them up and it drives from the space to where they are on show : the car will undergo public tests next week after its unveiling the procedure is reversed when the driver comes back to pick up the car			2
the new @entity8 combines autonomous driving technology with sensors and automatic braking to ‘ see ’ other objects such as cars or people and interact with them safely			1
so if a car pulls out suddenly from a nearby bay , it can stop and wait for it to pass – even having the awareness to spot the newly vacant bay			0
mr @entity93 said : ' our approach is based on the principle that autonomously driven cars must be able to move safely in environments with non-autonomous vehicles and unprotected road users			0
' @entity8 said its aim is to be the world leader in the field of autonomous driving and to put the technology into real - world cars within a few year			1
it said that by the end of 2014 , the all new @entity159 model will feature elements of autonomous steering .			0

the @entity8 uses autonomous driving technology and sensors
drivers use a smart phone app to instruct the new car to go and park
the technology finds a vacant space and parks the car perfectly
drivers even get picked up by the car afterwards thanks to the system
