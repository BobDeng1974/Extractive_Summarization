some 56 per cent of people now say they would vote to stay in the @entity3 in a referendum , the highest level since 1991			1
pollsters say the surge in support for remaining in the @entity11 bloc of 18 countries is in part as a result of the rise of @entity16 , with supporters of other parties becoming more determined not to sever ties with @entity20			0
some 56 per cent of people now say they would vote for @entity2 to stay in the @entity3 support for @entity23 's @entity16 has soared by 13 points since 2012 , but backing for remaining in the @entity3 has risen by 12 points , as @entity26 prepares to renegotiate @entity2 's membership the new @entity29 survey shows how @entity16 's growing popularity has coincided with increasing support for @entity2 's membership of the @entity3			1
in november 2012 , @entity16 was on just 3 per cent in opinion polls and 48 per cent backed leaving the @entity3 , with only 44 per cent in favour of staying in			1
however , with @entity16 now on 16 per cent , @entity23 's dream of exit from the @entity3 appears to be further away			2
while @entity16 has risen 13 points in the polls , the number wishing to leave the @entity3 has fallen by 12 points , @entity29 found			1
@entity39 , head of political research at @entity41 , said : ' with the debate about @entity2 's relationship with the @entity3 a hot topic right now , our poll shows support for @entity2 's membership is up significantly since the depths of the @entity50 debt crisis in 2011 – although that does not mean that the public simply want the relationship to stay the same			1
' there is a polarisation in views - @entity16 supporters are twice as likely to say @entity57 is going to be important to their vote in the next election ( although it is still some way behind immigration ) and are much more sceptical , while supporters of the other parties put the issue lower down on their list and are more in favour of membership			2
' the poll reveals the highest level of support for remaining in the @entity3 since 1991 , coinciding with the rise of @entity16 among @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 voters , a majority are in favour of remaining in the @entity3			1
more than half ( 51 per cent ) of conservatives , 73 per cent of @entity72 voters and 82 per cent of @entity74 want @entity2 to stay in			0
but contrast , just 11 per cent of @entity16 supporters want to stay in			0
support for staying in the @entity3 is highest in @entity79 ( 66 per cent ) and @entity80 ( 60 per cent )			2
angry @entity81 blamed @entity23 , saying @entity16 has increasingly ‘ toxified ’ the case for a @entity2 exit beyond its core support			2
@entity73 mp @entity85 , a former vice-chairman of the party , said : ‘ today ’s poll puts into stark reality what would be the outcome if there were a referendum on the @entity3 in the next 12 months , which is being demanded by @entity16			1
‘ it is ironic indeed that it is @entity16 and some other @entity95 who , through their relentless negativity and messages without any hope , are setting back the out argument			0
' @entity73 mp @entity101 added : ‘ the challenge is to make a positive case for the @entity2 as a global trading nation whereas the @entity3 is shrinking as a world market			2
’ however , pro-europeans welcomed the news that support for staying in the @entity3 has risen			0
@entity74 president @entity108 said : ‘ it 's an encouraging sign that vindicates the courage shown by the @entity74 being the lone voice in favour of the @entity2 being better off working together with our neighbours in @entity57			0
’ a @entity16 spokesman , meanwhile , said 51 per cent agreed with the party 's call for a ' free trade deal with the @entity3 , against 43 per cent who want to keep the status quo or deepen ties '			2
the spokesman said : ' we can live with those statistics			0
of course when @entity26 dangles impossible negotiations under people 's noses then people want to believe him , but when he fails - as he surely will - then the polls will harden			0
' @entity129 , @entity130 , said : ' many of the public recognise the important economic benefits of staying within the @entity3			0
' politicians are mistaken if they think people just want to hear ever - louder eurosceptic rhetoric , especially at a time of economic and political uncertainty			0
this only increases cynicism about the major political parties			0
' @entity26 has promised to renegotiate @entity2 's membership of the @entity3 , before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
@entity144 , who was voted in as the new @entity146 president in @entity147 today , has called to make freedom of movement easier the prime minister vowed to put tackling immigration ' at the heart ' of his efforts to reform @entity20 ' grip on the @entity2			1
he is set to outline plans to limit the number of @entity57 migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks			0
however , mr @entity26 suffered a fresh set back today after new @entity20 chief @entity144 said freedom of movement should be made easier			1
mr @entity144 , who became @entity146 president despite the fierce objections of mr @entity26 , told one of his new commissioners to ' promote freedom of movement ' within the @entity3			1
outgoing @entity146 chief @entity166 insisted over the weekend that an arbitrary cap on @entity3 immigration would be incompatible with @entity3 law			2
mr @entity144 's call for @entity3 migration to be made even easier is a further blow to the prime minister			1
in a letter sent last month , mr @entity144 told ms @entity175 , a @entity176 mep , that she should be ' improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across @entity57 '			0
