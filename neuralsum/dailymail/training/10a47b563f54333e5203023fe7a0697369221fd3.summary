by @entity0 in an age when people are trying to cut energy use in everyday life , designers are increasing turning to nature for inspiration			0
one @entity10 designer has drawn upon the the bioluminescent qualities of jellyfish and fireflies to create glow - in - the - dark trees , that would n't look out of place in the @entity18 blockbuster @entity17			1
scientists have already created small glowing shrubs using biomimicry – the method of imitating systems found in nature to solve design problems			0
they would be made up of a large number of genetically - modified glowing plants to save electricity for street lighting			1
@entity49 , of @entity42 , has already developed the plants by splicing genes from bioluminescent bacteria with the chloroplast genome from a common pot plant to create ' @entity55 '			1
a project called @entity57 is designed to make ‘ normal ’ tress glow without using genetic modification			0
it would use a fine coating of ‘ biological paint ’ to make the trees glow at night			0
@entity64 and design consultancy , @entity66 , believes the cities of the future will be covered in ' glow - in - the - dark dust ' and fed by ' urban farms ' growing both on and inside buildings			1
spray - on light absorbing dust would give public buildings , roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night , helping to improve the safety of parks and alleyways			2
even trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches , they said			0
@entity36 is interested in lighting streets without using electricity and is working with scientists at the @entity40 and a company called @entity42 to bring his vision to life			1
he is interested in how creatures like @entity91 generate their own light and asked @entity93 : ‘ what can we learn from nature and apply to the built environment , to roads , to public spaces , to our urban landscape ? ’ he is working with @entity49 , who has already created genetically modified glow - in - the - dark plants , which will be sold by @entity42			1
dr @entity49 makes the glowing plants by splicing genes from bioluminescent bacteria with the chloroplast genome from a common pot plant to create ‘ @entity17 ’ , which emits a light similar in type to that made by fireflies			1
mr @entity36 plans on using a large number of the plants for a large art installation that will look like a glowing tree			1
‘ it will be incredibly fascinating to have these energy - neutral [ trees ] but at the same time incredibly poetic landscapes , ’ he said			0
@entity42 , the company behind the innovation , which is based in @entity118 , @entity119 , claim @entity17 is the first light - emitting plant			1
fantasy to reality ? the desire to harness the qualities of glowing animals evokes scenes from the blockbuster hit @entity17 ( pictured ) , where magical forests glowed by night @entity36 is interested in lighting streets without using electricity and is working with scientists at the @entity40 and a company called @entity42 , which has already created @entity133 glowing plants , to bring his vision ( illustrated ) to life it is a genetically - modified version of a regular pot plant called @entity138 and glows continuously during its lifetime			1
the firm is auctioning the first batch of glowing shrubs and taking pre-orders for further plants that it is currently nurturing			2
the phenomenon of living organisms glowing in the nature is called bioluminescence			1
there are over twenty independently evolved bioluminescent mechanisms found in nature as seen in glow worms , bobtail squids , deep - sea anglerfish and bacteria			0
a light - producing plant called @entity17 that glows like a firefly has already been created by @entity42			1
it is pictured in daylight ( left ) when it looks like a regular pot plant , but it can be seen to emit light in darkness autoluminescent plants - shrubs that produce light - are created by introducing the light - emitting pathway from marine bacteria into a plant 's chloroplasts			1
the company said that its plants are similar to fireflies			2
its light emission ‘ machinery ’ is encoded in its cells to let it constantly emit visible light during its life cycle of between two and three months			0
‘ the glow of @entity17 is best described as comparable in strength to starlight , ’ the company said			0
as well as mr @entity36 ’s work , another project called @entity57 is designed to make ‘ normal ’ tress glow without using genetic modification			1
the project would use a fine coating of ‘ biological paint ’ to make the trees glow at night			0
@entity64 and design consultancy , @entity66 , believes the cities of the future will be covered in ' glow - in - the - dark dust ' and fed by ' urban farms ' growing both on and inside buildings			2
the phenomenon of living organisms glowing in the nature is called bioluminescence			2

even trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches said the engineers who are behind @entity225 's @entity224 project - which hopes to build a new footbridge and public garden spanning the @entity228 linking @entity229 to @entity230			0
the spray - on dust and glowing trees would make street lighting less necessary , thus reducing the carbon footprint of urban centres , making them more environmentally friendly			2
to meet the increasing demand for food , vertical ' urban farms ' are also forecast with crops being grown in and on city buildings			0
@entity242 could also contribute to food supplies by providing places where people can forage for fruits , edible greenery and even insects			0
mr @entity36 believes that technology will ‘ completely disappear ’ in the future			2
‘ i do n’t think we ’ll be looking at screens so much … in the coming 10 to 15 years , ’ he said , but instead predicts that humans will be wearing technology and interacting with it in everyday life			0
engineering firm @entity66 thinks spray - on light absorbing dust would give public buildings , roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night , as pictured in this artist 's impression growing green : plant - covered high - rise city blocks could help increase life expectancy and reduce absences at work through sickness , according to the report by @entity66			2

@entity36 is interested in lighting streets without using electricity
the @entity10 designer has worked with the @entity40 and a company called @entity42 to bring his vision to life
the plans on using large number of genetically - modified glowing plants for a large art installation that will look like a glowing tree
other engineers are also planning on using bioluminescence to light cities in the future
