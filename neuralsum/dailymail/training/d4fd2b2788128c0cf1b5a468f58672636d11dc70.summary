by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 05:23 est , 4 october 2013 @entity1 backed @entity2 plans to strip the under - 25s of benefits if they refuse to take a job or training yesterday saying young people should not be allowed to simply ‘ cross their arms and sit on the sofa ’			1
the deputy prime minister said he would block any ‘ blanket removal ’ of handouts based simply on age			1
amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners , mr @entity1 said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s			1
the prime minister used his speech to the @entity2 conference to say that everyone under 25 should be ‘ earning or learning ’			0
aides said that would mean taking away @entity38 and @entity39 from those who refuse a job , a training place , an apprenticeship or a further education place			0
at the moment , @entity38 can be slashed if the jobless refuse to take work , but the @entity47 want to extend that to include @entity39 too			0
crackdown : mr @entity24 layed out his plans in his keynote speech at the @entity2 conference this week mr @entity1 told @entity53 radio station @entity27 : ‘ i think everybody agrees that if you can help it , you do n’t want youngsters on benefits , you want them either being active or earning or learning			1
‘ so i ’m all for making sure there ’s better conditionality so that the incentive to just rely on benefits is minimised			0
’ concessions : mr @entity1 said that he would not accept a blanket ban on handouts because of age he added : ‘ here ’s the big thing - and this is already in the rules by the way and i ’m a big supporter of this - if you do n’t take those opportunities up , do n’t expect you can go back home and just sit on benefits			1
' you ca n’t just say : “ i ’m going to cross my arms , sit on my sofa and not try ” , let ’s look at that			1
’ mr @entity1 said he would need to examine the detail of the conservative proposals and he rejected a previous @entity2 plan to simply strip @entity39 from everyone under the age of 25			1
he said : ‘ i ’m not in favour of just blanket removal of people just because they happen to be a certain age			2
‘ what if you ’re a youngster from @entity94 who ’s trying to make his or her way in @entity97 and you ’re trying really hard and then suddenly you ’re having the rug pulled from under your feet			0
’ treasury minister @entity100 sowed further confusion about what the plans would actually entail when he said the benefits crackdown would apply to ‘ all under - 25s ’			1
he said : ‘ it will affect all under - 25s			2
this is @entity2 policy , something we plan to put into our conservative manifesto			0
‘ for under - 25s , there ’ll be two options , which is earning or learning			2
' and that ’s not just because it ’s the right thing to do for those individuals concerned , but it ’s also right for hardworking taxpayers that are paying for these benefits through their taxes			0
’ trouble ahead ? but amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners , mr @entity1 said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s a senior @entity2 source said : ‘ we ’re not talking about a blanket ban			1
we ’re talking about conditionality if people refuse to take a job or a training place			2
' we ’ve said there will be exemptions for people emerging from care and for the disabled			2
we are also examining what to do about single mothers with young children			0
’ mr @entity100 admitted : ‘ there ’s a lot of detail to work out			0
this is something we ’ll flesh out over the coming months to get it ready for our manifesto			0
‘ but our intention is clear - that young people , too many of them , thousands each year slide into a life on benefits when they leave compulsory education			1
' that ’s not acceptable - it ’s not good for them , and it ’s not good for taxpayers			0

mr @entity1 said that young people should *n't* be allowed to ' simply cross their arms and sit on the sofa '
but he added that he would block any attempt at a blanket ban on handouts for under - 25s
