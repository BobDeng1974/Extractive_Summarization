' i do n't forgive anybody for what happened to me			2
that is very important , ' @entity8 told the court after describing the late - night assault in which a masked attacker threw acid from a jar in his face as he returned home from the @entity50			1
accusations : the defendants include @entity28 , a dancer at the @entity50 , and could face up to 12 years in jail if convicted of organising and staging the attack @entity28 has denied any role in the attack and his alleged accomplice , @entity58 , right , said he acted alone			0
