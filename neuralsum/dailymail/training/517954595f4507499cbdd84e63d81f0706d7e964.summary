@entity0 is not wasting time and energy fretting about @entity4 's mounting injury problems , although his frustration with the fixture scheduling is clear			1
saints are in their best - ever position at this stage of a @entity11 season , with the impressive win at @entity13 meaning they enter the weekend sat third			2
wednesday 's win at @entity15 also means they remain in the @entity17 , although these victories have come at a cost as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 have all been injured over the past week			1
@entity0 is frustrated with the fixture schedule despite his side 's impressive performances @entity22 's setback has been particularly frustrating for @entity0 , with the @entity28 midfielder facing a month out with a hamstring injury sustained during the third - round replay at @entity31 - a match the @entity33 sees no need for			1
' i do n't put too much energy in that problem [ of injuries ] because you ca n't do anything about that , ' @entity0 said			1
' you can always look to what you are doing in the training sessions and how we recover the players , but we have n't trained in the last few weeks because we played so much			1
' it 's a problem with the schedule that the players have during what normally has to be a winter break			2
' we have to play			0
another replay ? come on , please , play the @entity17 with extra time and penalties			0
why a replay ? another game - it 's crazy			0
' @entity0 saw @entity4 beat @entity13 at @entity57 to go up to third in the @entity11 the injuries brought on by that schedule compound the pre-existing problems @entity61 and @entity63 have , as well as the absence of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 due to international commitments			1
@entity0 is confident @entity4 can ' handle this ' number of missing key players , although concedes that will change if that list grows further			1
the @entity33 can at least call upon @entity73 against @entity74 this weekend , having been ineligible to face @entity15 , and @entity75 could come in , having returned from an injury lay - off with 45 minutes for the under - 21s on monday			1
@entity22 suffered a hamstring injury against @entity15 and is set for a month on the sidelines @entity80 will have also given @entity0 food for thought with his display against @entity15 , against whom his strike was enough to secure progress in the cup			1
' @entity80 showed his quality and his confidence , ' the @entity4 boss said			0
' it 's not a question about his confidence , it 's that in the last few games he did n't start in the team			0
' we need everybody and we need @entity80 , and if @entity80 gets the opportunity he has to show his qualities like he did			0
' if @entity80 is to feature , he may have to again play out wide with @entity100 likely to lead the line at @entity74 in saturday 's late kick - off			0
@entity104 's exit and murmurings of discontent at @entity107 would seem to make this a decent time to face the @entity108 , but @entity0 will not be taking them for granted			2
' i do n't think it is a good time or a bad time [ to face them ] , ' @entity0 said			2
' every game is different			0
' they play at home , they have had some defeats in the last few weeks and , for sure , they will have some fans feeling [ bad ] about the 4 - 0 that they got in @entity4			2
' but we know they are a strong team at home			0
they beat @entity125 at home , but it is not easy to beat @entity4			0

@entity0 's @entity4 sit in third place in the @entity11
@entity0 *admits* his players have n't trained much in the last few weeks
@entity22 suffered a hamstring injury against @entity15
