by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 8 march 2013 a recently discovered comet is closer to @entity2 than it has ever been - and stargazers in the @entity4 are finally going to be able to see it			1
called pan-starrs , the comet passed within 100 million miles of @entity2 on tuesday , its closest approach in its first - ever cruise through the inner solar system			1
the ice ball will get even closer to the sun this weekend - just 28 million miles from the sun and within the orbit of @entity15			1
@entity16 and @entity6 were both visible over the @entity17 in @entity18 last week last week @entity19 , between 10 to 17 metres wide , passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away			1
on february 15 , almost 1,000 people were injured when a meteor hit the town of @entity25 , in the @entity27 mountains in @entity28			0
a bright comet show is also now on the way - @entity30 may come close to outshining the moon in november			2
the comet has been visible for weeks from the @entity33 but now the top half of the world will get a glimpse as well			1
the best viewing days should be next tuesday and wednesday , when @entity6 appears next to a crescent moon at dusk in the western sky			0
until then , glare from the sun will obscure the comet			1
@entity45 astronomer , dr @entity44 , said the comet 's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it			2
binoculars likely will be needed for the best viewing , he said , warning onlookers to avoid pointing them at the setting sun. ‘ wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight , ’ dr @entity44 advised			1
pan-starrs ' name is an acronym for the @entity64 telescope used to spot it two years ago - the @entity65			2
@entity6 was observed on august 9 , 2012 , by @entity67 astronomer @entity66 in @entity68 this picture of @entity6 was taken on february 8 , 2013 , in @entity68 the volcano - top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way			2
- and in recent months there have been several last week , @entity19 2013 @entity19 is between 10 to 17 metres wide - roughly the same size as the one which exploded above @entity28 's @entity27 mountains last month , injuring 1,000 people			2
it was discovered on march 2 , and passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away in the early hours of this morning			1
thought to be billions of years old , the comet originated in the distant oort cloud - a cloud of icy bodies well beyond the orbits of @entity90 and @entity91 - and somehow got propelled toward the inner solar system			2
it has never passed by @entity2 before , dr @entity44 said			1
close - up of comet c / 2011 @entity96 as seen from @entity97 , @entity68 this , however , is far from the only comet that has been making headlines this year			0
on february 15 , almost 1,000 people were injured when a meteor hit the town of @entity25 , in the @entity27 mountains in @entity28			0
a thunderous ‘ sonic boom ’ shattered windows , rocked buildings and interrupted mobile phone networks			0
the burst of light and thunderous sound were caused by a 40 - ton meteor penetrating the @entity2 ’s atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000mph			1
as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time			0
for those in search of comet @entity96 , look to the west after sunset in early and mid-march			0
this graphic shows the comet 's expected positions in the sky a comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on @entity139 , astronomers say.according to current calculations , comet @entity131 ( @entity130 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity144 planet.but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity153 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course			1
respected astronomer @entity156 , author of @entity159 's @entity158 blog , has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with @entity139 would cause a one billion megaton @entity163 , he says , is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on @entity2			1
a bright comet show is also now on the way - @entity30 may come close to outshining the moon in november			0
it was discovered last september by @entity28 astronomers and got its acronym name from the @entity170			0
scientists have also identified a comet that is hurtling into our solar system from deep in space , and which could next year hit @entity139 with potentially catastrophic force			0
loudest ever infrasonic shockwave : this image from a @entity28 driver 's dashboard camera shows the explosion caused as a meteorite burned up in the atmosphere over central @entity28 a fortnight ago according to current calculations , comet @entity131 ( @entity130 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity139			2
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity153 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course			0
@entity197 / 2011 @entity198 as seen from @entity97 , @entity68			0
the lights on the distant horizon are from the city of @entity202 , which is southeast of @entity203			0

pan-starrs is to come within 28 million miles of the sun this weekend
follows a spate of comet and asteroid *sighting* in 2013
this is the closest the newly discovered ice ball has ever been to the @entity2
it will be visible in the @entity4 with binoculars
