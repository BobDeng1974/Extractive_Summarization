by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 18 november 2013 it was once one of the dirtiest and most polluted rivers in the @entity3 - but the @entity4 is now the best in @entity6 and @entity7 for salmon			1
over the past few decades the murky waters of the river have been transformed into a haven for wildlife - including thousands of salmon			1
a vast improvement in the quality of the previously heavily - polluted water has made as huge difference to conditions for the fish , combined with the introduction of baby salmon - or parr - from a nearby hatchery			2
@entity22 leaping upstream on the @entity4 , which according to the latest reports is the best salmon fishing river in @entity6 and @entity7 thriving : an @entity26 salmon caught by the @entity28 salmon hatchery , in the @entity4 in @entity29			2
the river was once heavily - polluted but is now an abundant source of the fish images of salmon leaping up the fresh waters of the @entity4 are a far cry from pictures showing the river 's grim industrial past			1
for centuries the river was choked with filth because it was used as a major route for the export of coal , from the 13th century until the decline of the coal mining industry in north - east of @entity6 in the second half of the 20th century			0
@entity48 , of @entity49 , which sells day passes for fishing on the river , said : ' the grading of rivers is based on statistical evidence obtained from @entity54 and @entity55 of the number of salmon running the river			0
' the @entity4 tops this list in @entity6 and @entity7 for salmon and is second in @entity6 for sea trout			2
return journey : earlier this year thousands of salmon made their way up the @entity4 to spawn after an ocean odyssey a salmon leaping upstream			2
the fish return to the exact spot they were hatched themselves after travelling as far afield as @entity72 and @entity73 anglers are now flocking to the river to try and hook themselves a salmon			0
just decades earlier this would have been unthinkable catch : hatchery assistant @entity79 , from the @entity28 salmon hatchery , checks an @entity26 salmon ' many people believe that this is the result of two factors , the improvement in quality of water in the @entity4 and the stocking of the river with salmon parr			1

a far cry : the @entity4 in its industrial heyday thanks to conservation efforts , many major @entity3 waterways have been transformed hatchery assistant @entity79 with newly hatched @entity26 salmon			1
much of reason for the abundance of salmon is the release of baby salmon by the hatchery many of the @entity3 's rivers have undergone an astonishing reversal of fortunes in just a few decades			1
not long ago many were little more than foul - smelling conduits for sewage and industrial waste - in the 60s the @entity114 was declared ' biologically dead ' and if anyone fell in , authorities would have to quarantine them			0
now , thanks to the decline of heavy industry , stricter legislation and conservation efforts , many are once again teeming with species of fish , birds and other wildlife			1
the @entity114 now has roughly 125 species of fish , while more than 400 species of invertebrates live in the mud , water and river banks			0
it now ranks among the cleanest metropolitan tideways in the world			0
fisheries officer @entity138 ( left ) and hatchery assistant @entity79 catalogue the fish fishing : workers from the @entity28 salmon hatchery drag a net through the @entity4 for centuries the river was choked with filth because it was used as a major route for the export of coal			1

the @entity4 , once clogged with industrial run - off , now has abundant salmon
the fish have returned in *droves* thanks to conservation efforts
many @entity3 rivers now teem with life after *shaking* off decades of pollution
