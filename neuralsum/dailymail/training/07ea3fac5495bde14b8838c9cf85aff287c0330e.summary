by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 08:43 est , 6 march 2014 scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of @entity6 patients to help them resist the @entity8 virus			1
the @entity10 researchers say the treatment seems both safe and promising			0
the results give hope that this approach might one day free patients from their grueling daily drug regime			0
scientists have found a way of modifying genes in the blood cells of @entity6 patients to help them resist the @entity8 virus			1
image shows @entity6 in human lymphatic tissue as a result , the researchers say it could offer a form of cure			1
the news comes just the day after doctors in @entity29 announced they hope they have cured a baby born with @entity6			1
the baby girl , who was born in @entity32 last year , is the second to have been put into remission - and possibly cured - by very early treatment			1
she was treated four hours after her birth and , now , shows no signs of being infected			2
the girl 's doctors say they are cautious about claiming she is cured but say they hope this is the case			1
the idea for the gene modification treatment came from an @entity8 patient who appears to be cured after receiving a cell transplant seven years ago in @entity45			0
the treatment could free patients from a daily regime of taking antiretroviral drugs the transplant came from a donor with natural immunity to @entity6			1
only about one per cent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection			0
so , researchers are seeking a more practical way to get similar results by using gene therapy to modify patients ' own blood cells			0
a study of this in 12 patients was led by dr @entity66 at the @entity67			0
@entity6 usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface - a ' docking station ' called @entity72			2
a @entity74 company , @entity73 , makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes @entity72			0
the 12 @entity6 patients involved in the study had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells			2
the @entity73 gene - snipping compound was added in the lab , and the cells were infused back into the patients			2
four weeks later , half of the patients were temporarily taken off @entity8 medicines to see the gene therapy 's effect			0
the virus returned in all but one of them , but the modified cells seemed to be protected from hiv infection and were more likely to survive than the cells that had not been treated			2
' we knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients , but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines , ' said dr @entity103 , one of the @entity67 researchers			1
that would be what doctors call a ' functional cure ' , because the virus would still be present but held in check without treatment			1
the lone patient whose @entity6 did not return turned out to have one copy of the protective gene , so ' nature had done half of the job already , ' dr @entity103 said			0
experts say the treatment could offer a ' functional cure ' as @entity6 would still be present in the patient but no further treatment would be required to keep it under control the @entity125 sponsored the work with @entity73 and @entity67			1
' the ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body that 's been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with @entity6 , ' said institute director dr. @entity131			2
' but we are a long way from there at this point			0
' @entity136 , 53 , who works for @entity137 , an advocacy and service organisation in @entity140 , had the treatment more than three years ago during an earlier study			0
although the virus rebounded when he temporarily went off @entity6 medicines , tests show his modified blood cells are still multiplying			1
' hopefully one day i 'll be able to say i 'm @entity6 negative again , ' he said .			0

scientists modified genes in cells of patients to help them resist the virus
if effective , this could mean they no longer need *antireteroviral* drugs
as a result , it could be *classed* as a ' functional cure ' - @entity6 would still be present in their bodies but they would need no treatment to control it
*yesterday* , doctors announced that they hope they have cured a baby girl who was born @entity6 *positive* but was treated within hours of her birth
