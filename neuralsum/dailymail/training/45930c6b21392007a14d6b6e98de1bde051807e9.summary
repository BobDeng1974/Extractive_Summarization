lord @entity12 , 81 , was incensed when the @entity15 murals he painted were removed from @entity16 , @entity17 , after his son @entity18 took over the running of the ancestral pile - which includes 900 acres of grounds and a safari park			1
now the flamboyant artworks will be reinstated - in a corridor one storey above their former home			2
feud : the @entity28 , 81 , with one of the @entity15 murals removed from his ancestral stately home of @entity16 , @entity17			1
the row prompted him to boycott his son 's wedding , the told the @entity35 anger : lord @entity12 and his son , whose title is @entity28 , in happier times at @entity40 mural : one example from what became known as the ' @entity15 corridor ' in the stately home @entity18 , whose title is @entity28 , sparked an apparent family feud earlier this year when his father 's hand - painted murals disappeared from @entity16			1
the painter did not attend his son 's wedding at the @entity53 stately home , telling the @entity35 : ‘ i only found out once the removal had started			1
it ’s my life ’s work and he ’s quietly binned it			1
lord @entity12 's daughter - in - law @entity56 , pictured , insisted the whole row was caused by a mix - up ' it ’s killed my relationship with him and i do n’t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding			2
’ instead of attending his son 's wedding , lord @entity12 and his wife pointedly went to the wedding of a family friend in @entity71			1
but his son 's new wife was devastated , saying it was a misunderstanding and the murals were simply in storage			2
@entity56 , a tv chef who became the first black viscountess when she married @entity18 this summer , said : ' i can assure you that none of the murals that were previously in place in our apartment have been “ binned ”			0
' the ones @entity18 has moved have been very carefully preserved			0
' @entity16 is one of the finest examples of @entity87 in @entity88 and has been in lord @entity12 's family for 473 years			1
bought by sir @entity91 for £ 53 in 1540 , the original house burned down a few years later but had been mostly rebuilt by 1580 and is now open to the public			0
it is home to one of the largest private book collections in @entity97 and the @entity98 contains the bloodied silk - sleeved waistcoat which was worn by @entity100 at his execution in 1649			0
a planning application lodged with @entity103 confirmed the murals will be re-hung in the south corridor on the second floor			1
the new home for the artwork is one storey higher than its original home , which became known as ' @entity112 passage '			0
a spokesman for @entity114 , a @entity116 architect firm , said : ' the @entity15 murals are currently held in store			0
' following careful checking of room sizes , it was confirmed the artwork would fit largely unaltered , within the second floor south passage			0
magnificent : @entity16 was built in the mid- 1500s and is one of the best examples of @entity53 architecture artist : lord @entity12 , whose full name is @entity129 , painted several murals in the house himself ' the height of the ceiling means the central inscription , a simple text on a plain board , will need to be smaller			2
' the artwork has been aligned to fit along the length of the existing passage without interfering with fire doors			0
' however , the current door positions in the murals will need to be closed off , and new openings formed , corresponding to the existing passageway door locations , serving the rooms beyond			0
' the proposed works are entirely reversible , thereby following good conservation practice			0

81 - year - old 's art removed after his son took over running of @entity17 pile
he *claimed* the works had been ' quietly binned ' , which his family *denied*
planning application reveals they will soon return to @entity16 after all
