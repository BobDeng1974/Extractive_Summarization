@entity0 says he wants to ' jazz up ' test matches by reducing them to four days @entity0 has risked offending cricket ’s purists , saying he wants to ‘ jazz up ’ test matches by reducing them to four days from the traditional five			1
@entity0 , who takes over as @entity10 chairman from @entity11 on may 15 , believes test cricket faces an identity crisis			1
and , while he was expressing his personal views only , it seems probable they will get an airing when he meets his international counterparts in the @entity20 boardroom			0
‘ you ca n’t continue to leave @entity12 as it is , ’ @entity0 told the lords.org website			2
‘ if you look at it worldwide , test cricket is shrinking in the number of people who are watching it on tv and in the grounds			1
‘ somehow , somewhere , there is a way to improve test cricket			1
it ’s the bastion , but we ’ve got to modernise it			0
we ’ve got to jazz it up			0
‘ i think we should look at four - day test cricket and play 105 overs a day starting at half past ten in the morning , with the ground drainage you ’ve got now , and finish when you finish , as all the grounds now have lights			1
‘ every test match would start on a thursday , so you have two days for corporates , and two days for families			2
from a cost point of view you ’d save that fifth day , which would save a hell of a lot of money from the ground ’s point of view and the broadcasters			0
‘ in reality , there ’s not many people who turn up and watch it on the fifth day			0
’ @entity0 ’ formula would trim a total of only 30 overs off a test : the current format is five days of 90 overs each )			1
but it leaves little wriggle room in case of bad weather – a perennial problem during the @entity71 summer			0
and , while he has a point about poor fifth - day attendances , his plan would risk sacrificing some of the thrilling finishes test matches have witnessed over the past few years			2
only last season the games against @entity78 at @entity79 and @entity80 both came down to the final over			0
@entity82 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity84 during day five of last season 's test match an attempt to squeeze in an extra 15 overs a day would not be without its drawbacks either : test teams habitually struggle to bowl the current minimum of 90 without making use of the extra half - hour allotted to them			1
cricket would also lose one of its enduring charms : the deteriorating fifth - day pitch , even if these are less common than they used to be			0
and that ’s all before the broadcasters have their say			0
at least @entity0 ’s thought process suggests the kind of open - mindedness too often lacking among cricket ’s administrators			1
too many have harrumphed ineffectually over the future of the @entity12 game in those parts of the world that favour the shorter formats – only then to announce the formation of yet another domestic twenty20 tournament			0
a few weeks ago , @entity0 insisted @entity113 , who recently joined @entity114 , must be playing county cricket to stand any chance of appearing for @entity117 whether or not his comments amount to anything other than a personal opinion , they confirm the view that @entity0 will be very much his own man once he replaces @entity11 , who will assume the new role of @entity10 president			1
that much was evident a few weeks ago when @entity0 appeared to offer a route back into the @entity117 team for @entity113 , saying he needed to be playing county cricket to stand any chance			1
@entity0 has been perplexed by the spin placed on those comments , insisting @entity117 ’s stance on the @entity113 issue has not changed			2
but , with six weeks still to go until he assumes office , @entity0 is already carving out a reputation as a man who means business .			2
