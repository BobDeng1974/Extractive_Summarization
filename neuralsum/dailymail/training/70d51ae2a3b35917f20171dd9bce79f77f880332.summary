by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 26 september 2013 a @entity2 mother says she 's cracked her son 's murder case eight years after his death was deemed an accident			1
@entity7 worked tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened on the rainy june day in 2005 when her son @entity10 , 34 , was fatally injured			1
she was told he died after falling off his bike and hitting his head on a curb but that explanation did n't add up			1
this week , thanks to her detective work , @entity18 , has been arrested and charged with @entity10 's murder			1
police now say he struck @entity10 in the head with a handgun when he tried to stop a fight			1
the impact saw the man fall to the ground and hit the concrete			0
' i 'm just kind of numb			0
i 'm very much relieved , ' @entity7 told @entity37			2
eyewitness accounts that are now considered to be false claimed @entity10 died after he was doing tricks on his bike and slipped , hitting his head on the curb			1
but @entity7 inspected the bike and saw no scratches or damage , and also learned there was no curb in the area that her son could have slammed his head against			1
suspicious , @entity7 managed to pinpoint @entity18 as a suspect just days after the incident , while her son was still clinging to life in a coma			1
@entity7 and her daughter , @entity55 , spread the word that @entity10 was recovering in hospital and giving details about what actually happened			1
' this is how we got people to talk ... @entity10 did n't actually speak to anybody , ' @entity7 told @entity37			1
nine days later , he was taken off life support and passed away on july 6 , 2005			0
fight : eyewitness accounts that are now considered to be false claimed @entity10 , left , died after he was doing tricks on his bike and slipped but police believe @entity18 , right , hit him in the head with a handgun but the ploy worked and @entity7 got a partial confession from @entity18 who admitted to hitting @entity10 with his fist , though he said it was an accident			1
he added that ' @entity10 was getting back up to beat him up , so he ran			2
' ' i think he was trying to deflect , pinning all fault on the others , ' @entity77 said			0
@entity7 went straight to the police with the information but they refused to believe her son 's death may not have been an accident			0
determined not to give up , @entity7 and @entity77 carried on their own investigation for the next eight years , keeping careful notes			0
' we worked good as a team , ' @entity7 said			2
she said once she had done the leg work , @entity77 helped her find the names , numbers , and locations , necessary to piece it all together			0
but the break they needed came in june 2012 when lt. @entity98 , a detective in her son 's case , came into the @entity102 restaurant where @entity7 was working			2
murder : @entity18 , pictured left and right , has been charged with second degree murder			1
he has yet to be arraigned and has not entered a plea relief : @entity7 is relieved that her tireless detective work has paid off and @entity18 will be tried without realizing who he was , she began talking about her son 's case to the officer , stirring his interest and the investigation was soon reopened			1
' i knew if we got the right people , eventually it would be solved			0
it 's getting the right person and eight years later , we got that right person , ' @entity7 told @entity37			2
' i never gave up			0
' now with the cold case reopened , police determined that the witnesses who said they saw @entity10 fall off his bike had changed their stories			2
one critical witness had suffered a stroke in the intervening years , and the health scare compelled him to come forward with the truth , feeling he owed it to himself and his family			0
police now say there was a fight between @entity18 and another man identified as @entity137 and @entity10 was trying to stop it when @entity18 struck him in the head with a handgun and fell to the ground , hitting the concrete			1
' my son was a good samaritan and he lost his life , ' @entity7 said			0
' if he had to lose his life , i 'm proud he lost his life doing a good thing			0
i think he is looking down on us and just so proud that we never gave up , that we got to the bottom of this			0
i feel him around me , and when i see him again , we will rejoice			0
' @entity18 has been charged with second degree murder			2
he has yet to be arraigned and has not entered a plea .			0
