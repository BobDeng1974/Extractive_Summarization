by @entity0 published : 00:27 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 25 september 2013 @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity1 opened a letter last month from an insurance underwriting specialist and learned he had seven months to find a new home for his family 's pit bulls or lose his home insurance			1
' due to a potential liability hazard , the aggressive dog should be removed from the premises , ' the letter from @entity12 read			2
' no aggressive dog or aggressive breed of dog should replace this dog			2
' such ultimatums are not uncommon for home owners who have what insurance companies deem ' dangerous dog ' breeds			1
@entity2 sits with his dogs @entity26 and @entity28 at his home in @entity3 , @entity1 just seven months before he may have to give them away dog bites accounted for more than one - third of all homeowners insurance liability claims paid out in 2012 , costing more than $ 489 million , according to the @entity33 ( iii )			1
there were 16,459 dog bite claims last year			1
the average cost of settling those claims was $ 29,752			0
@entity2 believes his insurance agency jumped to conclusions about his pit bull , however , based on what an underwriter saw through a window and what she heard : barking			1
' we 've been here for five of the seven years that we 've had this company insure our house , ' @entity2 , a highway technician at the @entity47 , told @entity52			2
' i do n't see how they can say they 're aggressive when they 've never met the dogs			0
this is pretty much discriminating against the breed , pretty much stereotyping the breed through the window			0
' insurance agency officials do n't disagree there is a bias , but say that 's based on past experience			0
when @entity2 's mother , @entity68 , a co-signer on her son 's mortgage , visited shelter insurance agent @entity71 in @entity3 , she accused him of being discriminatory toward pit bulls			1
' yes , i am , ' she quoted him as saying			0
' that 's exactly what he said			0
' owner @entity2 has seven months to choose between his dog @entity26 or his insurance policy @entity71 told @entity52 that excluding aggressive breeds of dogs from homeowners ' coverage is common in the insurance industry , and has been for decades			1
' if anyone in town knows you have a pit bull , no one is going to insure it unless you have a separate liability policy that you can buy for those breeds , ' @entity71 said			2
' i do n't sell it			0
' however , before he could help the @entity94 find a broker who would sell them a stand - alone liability insurance policy for the dogs , ' she threw the letter at me and called us dog racists , ' @entity71 told @entity52			1
' i could n't help her because she did n't want to be helped			0
we 're here to help people			0
that letter was meant for them to get coverage for those dogs somewhere else so they do n't have a gap in their policy			0
' pit bulls are not a common dog for homeowners , according to @entity71			2
' i have a thousand homeowner policies , he said			0
' if 1 percent have pit bulls , that 's probably pretty accurate			0
people who live in tenant property , non-owner occupants , have pit bulls			0
a lot of times , they end up at the pound and get adopted by people who are more responsible			0
it is what it is			0
some people are fans of the dog and seek it out			0
' owner @entity2 has seven months to choose between his dog @entity28 or his insurance policy @entity71 said he has no reason to doubt the @entity94 are responsible dog owners			1
' there are people who love this breed and think it can be saved and rehabilitated , ' he said			0
' i 'm not here to say it ca n't , but i offer a product that has rules with it			0
' some insurance companies do n't want to insure pit bulls or other dogs they consider high risk , said @entity33 vice president @entity148			1
' it really depends on the company how they handle what are considered aggressive dogs , ' she told @entity52			0
' some companies who have had large losses from certain breeds will not insure them			2
some companies will have what 's called a ' one bite rule			0
' if your dog bites someone , the company will pay for the occurrence , but then either will cancel the insurance or may exclude the dog from the policy , so if the dog bites someone again , the homeowner will be liable			1
' other insurers look at each dog individually and do not judge based on breed , @entity148 added			0
' they are aware that even normally docile dogs may bite when they are frightened or when defending their puppies , owners or food , ' she said			2
' the most dangerous dogs are those that fall victim to human shortcomings such as poor training , irresponsible ownership and breeding activities that foster viciousness			2
' @entity2 sits with his dog @entity26 at his home in @entity3 , @entity1 just seven months before his insurance policy may be cancelled neither of @entity2 's dogs has ever bitten anyone			1
' they 're not even remotely close to being aggressive , ' @entity2 said of @entity26 , a white female rescue dog whom he sent to obedience school as a condition of adopting her , and @entity28 , a black male with a white streak on his face and a white chest			1
when @entity52 visited @entity2 's home , both dogs barked , sniffed and wanted attention for a minute or two before calming down and posing for photographs			1
@entity26 seemed lazy , and sat on @entity2 's lap. when he let the dogs out in the front yard unrestrained , they did n't leave the property			1
@entity28 played fetch with a tennis ball			0
some insurance companies would take that into consideration when deciding coverage , but they do n't have to , which was the case with the @entity2 's insurance provider			1
@entity2 sits with his dogs @entity26 and @entity28 at his home in @entity3 , @entity1 seven months before he has to choose between his dogs or his insurance policy @entity221 , which insures one out of every four homes in @entity1 , asks each potential customer whether or not their dog has bitten anyone , said spokeswoman @entity226			1
' based on that answer and possible follow - up answers , we then determine if they qualify for homeowners insurance , ' she said			1
' we do not require a stand - alone liability policy			2
either they qualify for our homeowners policy or do not			0
' @entity221 alone had 3,670 dog bite claims nationally last year and paid more than $ 108 million as a result			1
among the top 10 states for dog bite claims in 2012 for @entity221 was @entity1 , coming in at seventh , one spot ahead of @entity241			1
man and woman 's best friend bites more than 4.7 million a year , according to the @entity245 , the @entity246 , @entity247 and the @entity248			2
each year , 800,000 @entity246 seek medical attention for those bites			2
shelter insurance has given the @entity94 until april to remove the dogs , which the couple have no intention of doing			1
@entity2 said he planned to start shopping around for a new policy after the first of the year .			1

such ultimatums are not uncommon for home owners who have what insurance companies deem ' dangerous dog ' breeds .
dog bites accounted for more than one - third of all homeowners insurance liability claims paid out in 2012
homeowner @entity2 has no intention of giving up his dogs and is shopping around for a new insurance plan for next year
