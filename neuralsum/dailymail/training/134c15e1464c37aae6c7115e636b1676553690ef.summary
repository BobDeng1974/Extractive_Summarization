children in older age groups were targeted more often than younger children , and overall boys outnumbered girls killed by about two to one , according to the research			0
the @entity8 said older boys in the 13 to 17 year old group were consistently the most frequent victims of targeted killings such as those involving sniper fire , execution or torture			0
the highest child casualty figures were in the governate of @entity30 , but relative to its size , the worst affected governorate was @entity54 , where roughly one in 400 children was recorded killed			2

co-author @entity94 added : ' what is most disturbing about the findings of this report is not only the sheer numbers of children killed in this conflict , but the way they are being killed			0
' bombed in their homes , in their communities , during day - to - day activities such as waiting in bread lines or attending school ; shot by bullets in crossfire , targeted by snipers , summarily executed , even gassed and tortured			0
' all conflict parties need to take responsibility for the protection of children , and ultimately find a peaceful solution for the war itself			0
' this study shows why explosive weapons should never be used where children live and play , how older children quickly become targets in a war and even the youngest suffer its worst abuses			0
