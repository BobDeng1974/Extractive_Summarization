by @entity0 with its manicured lawns , tropical foliage and neat bungalows , this idyllic setting on the edge of the @entity4 everglades would make for an ideal retirement community			1
@entity9 , however , is home to more than 100 registered sex offenders - half of its population - who have abused minors , viewed child pornography or even molested their own children			1
among them are a teacher , a pastor and a sports coach			0
more than half of the population of this @entity4 village on the edge of the everglades are sex offenders reminiscent of a retirement village : the area has manicured lawns , tropical foliage and neat bungalows the 24 - acre community was built in the 1960s to house sugar cane workers			1
in 2009 the @entity33 , a pastor with the @entity35 group @entity34 , began making housing available to sex offenders			1
@entity33 came up with the idea for the village largely because of a @entity4 state law that prevents offenders from living within 1,000ft of a school , park , day care centre or playground			1
some cities and counties have extended that to 2,500ft			0
forced out of densely populated areas , @entity9 offers sex offenders a place to live away from those restrictions - and it 's proved so popular there are between 10 and 20 applications from potential residents every week			1
the village is located about three miles from any other neighbors			0
it is self - contained , with its own water supply and sewage treatment plant			0
registered sex offenders living in the village include @entity63 ( left ) , the director of the christian ministry that offers the housing to offenders , and @entity68 ( right ) , 22 , convicted of having sex with a minor in demand : @entity9 has proved so popular there are between 10 and 20 applications from potential residents every week ' in the beginning , no one wanted us around , ' said @entity63 , a sex offender who is now director of @entity34 , in an interview in march with the @entity78			1
' but it 's totally changed , now we 're a part of the community			0
' married couple @entity82 and @entity83 said they would have no place to live if it were n't for @entity9			1
@entity82 was convicted of a sex offense for engaging in what he claims was consensual sex with his girlfriend at the time , who was 16 years old			2
' we had searched for places to live and nobody would rent to us , ' @entity83 told the @entity94			2
' if it was n't for this place we would be homeless			0
' the village does not allow offenders who are convicted of violent sex crimes against strangers			2
@entity101 , the intake coordinator for the ministry who is also a registered sex offender , told the @entity104 : ' we try not to accept people with a history of violence or drugs , or to take any diagnosed paedophile - that is , someone who can only become sexually aroused by a child			2
the village was set up in 2009 by the @entity33 , a pastor with @entity34 , in large part because of state law that prevents offenders living within 1,000ft of a school , day care centre or playground ' we want to protect the people who are already here and those who were living here before us			1
' some children do live in the village , however , as state laws allow sex offenders to live in the same neighborhood as minors , although some may be banned from having contact with them			1
one such resident is 22 - year - old @entity68 , who is barred from speaking to anyone under 18 after he had sex with a 14 - year - old who he believed was older			0
he was sentenced to two years ' house arrest followed by probation for eight years			0
after breaching the terms of his licence , he was ordered to the village by a judge			0
' it 's been a blessing in disguise ... i feel as though i have a destiny with @entity9			2
i feel at home and safe here - i love the people , ' he said			0
you can hear more about this story on the @entity152 programme assignment on thursday 1 august .			0
