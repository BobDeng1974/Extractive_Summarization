but that 's easier said than done			0

the @entity12 finalized guidelines wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories , which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people			1
in the @entity32 , adults get about 11 to 15 per cent of their calories from sugar ; the figure for children tops that at about 16 per cent			0
by comparison , sugar intakes ranges in @entity40 from about seven per cent in @entity41 to nearly 25 percent in @entity42			2
but research indicates that many people are n't aware of how much sugar they 're eating every day			1
in fact , that 's one reason the @entity48 is proposing the first overhaul of nutrition labels in two decades			0

healthy ? while salad might seem like the healthy option , the dressings used to add flavor to them are often loaded with sugars in the meantime , though , companies do n't currently disclose how much of the sugar listed in the nutrition panels of their products are from added sugars rather than naturally occurring ones			2
according to health experts , many everyday food products , which some might perceive to be completely healthy , are actually loaded with hidden sugars			0
salad dressings , soups , yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content ; the popular deluxe @entity86 salad dressing from @entity88 , for example , has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing			1
similarly , @entity94 's @entity93 contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can			1
' in reality , we find ( these sugars ) in the majority of products , ' @entity99 , who heads the @entity101 's @entity100 , said			0
salad dressing : picking a salad over a ham sandwich seems like a virtuous choice			1
but the amount of sugar it comes with can vary depending on the dressing you put on top of it			1
wish - bone 's deluxe @entity86 salad dressing , for instance , lists four grams ( about one teaspoon ) of sugar per serving ( two tablespoons )			1
soup : a cup of soup of soup is comforting thought , but even savory varieties can have sugar			2
a can of @entity94 's @entity130 has four grams ( about one teaspoon ) of sugar per serving , with a can containing two servings			1
@entity134 : another seemingly healthful choice that can come with lots of sugar			0
some of the sugar is naturally occurring from the dairy , but companies add sweeteners too			0
a container of @entity145 's 0 % fat @entity144 yogurt in black cherry flavor lists 17 grams ( about four teaspoons ) of sugar			1
bread : that toast you 're about to smother with jam might 've already been a little sweetened			0
a store brand of enriched white bread at the convenience store chain @entity153 listed two grams ( about half a teaspoon ) of sugar for per serving ( two slices )			1
@entity157 : it depends on the variety you pick , but peanut butter can come with added sugar too			0
@entity165 's @entity164 variety lists seven grams ( almost two teaspoons ) of sugar per serving ( two tablespoons )			1
@entity167 : most people know that cereal has sugar , especially the varieties for kids			2
in some cases , you might be surprised that there is n't much difference between options			0

frozen meals : in case it was n't clear by now , just because it 's not dessert does n't mean it does n't have added sugar			0
@entity191 's @entity190 microwavable pizza has seven grams ( almost two teaspoons ) of sugar in a single - serving pie .			2

the @entity12 is urging people to cut down on the amount of sugar they consume each day to between 25 and 50 grams
one can of soup can contain as much as two teaspoons of sugar , while some salad dressing has one teaspoon of sugar in every two tablespoons
