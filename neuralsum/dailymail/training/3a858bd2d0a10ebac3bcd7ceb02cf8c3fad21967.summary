the following year , on june 1 , 2005 , @entity2 was charged with financial transaction card fraud and sentenced to 200 days in jail and two years probation , alongside being given a $ 500 fine			1
living it up : @entity2 , 28 , gets behind the wheel of a @entity116 in @entity117 it is all a far cry to where @entity2 now finds himself : hobnobbing with @entity117 's a list at parties and award ceremonies			2

speaking about a future in acting , he told the @entity164 : ' yeah , i want to keep on doing it ... any role , as long as it ’s a good story , it does n’t matter ... i 'm moving to @entity141 and i ’m reading some scripts now , specifically there ’s a tv show that i ’m reading for			2
