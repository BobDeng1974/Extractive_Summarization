it sounds like they 're not ' lovin ' it ' as much as they used to			2
the world 's biggest fast food chain has unveiled a new slogan in an attempt to stop its sales from sinking			1
' @entity9 ' will be launched next year , and is a campaign aimed to spread happiness in the face of internet hate			1
@entity18 's new slogan ' @entity16 ' , will be launched next year at the @entity19 according to the @entity21 , the roll - out will include a spot during @entity23 on february 1			1
the marketing ploy comes at a time when worldwide sales dropped by 30 per cent in the third quarter of last year			1
the current catchphrase ' i 'm @entity9 ' it ' will still remain as a global slogan			1
an inside source said the change is aimed ' to spread happiness in the face of internet hate , ' but the @entity21 did not elaborate on what that precisely means			0
officially , the company is staying mum about the possibility			2
' we 're always working with our partners on great new creative , ' said a spokesperson			0
' it 's highly speculative and premature to talk about @entity19 ads and future campaigns for next year			1
' the reported change will come during a tough time for the world 's largest hamburger chain			1
after posting yet another disappointing quarter , @entity51 's ceo @entity50 admitted last week that the company has n't been keeping up with the times and that changes are in store for its @entity58 restaurants			1
bad food image to defend the image of its food , @entity18 's launched a social media campaign last week inviting customers to ask questions about the ingredients it uses			1
showing just how bad perceptions can be , among the first questions @entity18 's addressed were ' why does n't your food rot ? ' and ' do you use real chicken in your @entity73 ? ' the company has run similar programs in @entity76 and @entity77 , where it says the program has built trust with customers			1
lack of flexibility @entity82 has long been one of @entity18 's attractions - people like knowing exactly what they 'll get when they order a @entity87 now people are gravitating toward places like @entity90 that let people tailor their orders			2
to offer greater customization down the line , @entity18 's recently rolled out prep tables in its kitchens that can hold more toppings and sauces			2
the company is also testing a build - your - own - burger offering in southern @entity103 that lets people pick the bun , patty and toppings they want			2
in @entity77 , @entity18 's has already said it plans to roll out the format nationwide			2
@entity109 , inaccurate service @entity18 's executives have said they introduced too many items too quickly last year , such as @entity113 and the option to substitute egg whites for its breakfast sandwiches			1
that slowed down service and led to inaccurate orders			0
on tuesday , @entity18 's said it would focus on a simplified menu that highlights its most popular items but did not give specifics			1
price sensitivity raising prices without driving away customers has been tricky for @entity18 's			2
at one time , for instance , the popular @entity127 included a @entity129 , which was made with a quarter - pound of beef			0
but over the years , @entity18 's has had to swap out items as costs for beef and cheese have climbed			2
late last year , @entity18 's revamped its @entity127 to be called the ' @entity137 , ' with a range of prices up to $ 5			1
increased competition in addition to newer players like @entity90 , longtime rivals @entity143 and @entity145 have been intensifying competition , too			0
and @entity147 launched a national breakfast menu to go after the growing breakfast market			0
@entity150 reports that the new slogan has received negative comments online , with @entity154 users condemning the chain for their decision			1
@entity50 said that starting in january @entity51 will ' simplify ' its menu to make room for restaurants to offer options that are best - suited for their regions			0
to offer greater customization , he also said the company planned to expand its ' @entity166 ' offering that lets people pick the buns and toppings they want on burgers by tapping a touchscreen			0
the program is currently being offered in @entity103 , and @entity18 's has said it will roll it out nationally in @entity77			0
' we have n't been changing at the same rate as our customers ' eating - out expectations , ' @entity50 conceded during a conference call outlining the changes			0
feeling the pinch : while @entity18 's sales tank , restaurants with a more ' wholesome ' image are flourishing			1
as a result , people have been gravitating to places like @entity90 , which markets its ingredients as being of superior quality as more and more consumers turn their backs on the @entity192 , @entity18 's recently launched its first ever consumer outreach exercise , inviting customers to ask questions on their @entity196			0
the remarks came after @entity18 's said sales at established locations fell 3.3 percent globally and in the @entity58 division , marking the fourth straight quarter of declines in its home market			1
the changes come as @entity18 's continues to struggle with myriad problems			0
one of its biggest challenges in the @entity58 is long - held perceptions around the freshness and quality of its ingredients			0
the chain has been fighting to boost sales as people gravitate toward foods they feel are more wholesome			2
as a result , people have been gravitating to places like @entity90 , which markets its ingredients as being of superior quality			0
@entity18 's , which has more than 35,000 locations around the world , said it expects its challenges will continue into the current quarter , with global sales down for october as well			1
for the quarter , revenue declined to $ 6.99 billion , short of the $ 7.23 billion @entity228 expected			0
net income declined to $ 1.07 billion , or $ 1.09 per share			0
