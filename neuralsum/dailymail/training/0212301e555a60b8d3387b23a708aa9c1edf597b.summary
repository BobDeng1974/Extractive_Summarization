seventy years after helping recover stolen art from the @entity2 , @entity0 gets to see his story on the big screen in the searing heat , some 700 feet deep in the bowels of the @entity7 salt mine in @entity8 , @entity0 prised open one of the 40,000 mud - crusted crates stacked by the shaft			1
inside , piled high , were scores of paintings			2
haltingly , he unwrapped the first			2
inside the packing paper , its vibrant colours glancing off the flickering light of his pit lamp , the distinctive features of @entity16 gazed back			2
@entity0 recognised it at once			1
six years before , in 1938 , as a 13 year old art lover in his native @entity25 in @entity8 , he had yearned to see the @entity28 artist ’s iconic self - portrait that hung in the town ’s museum			2
but as a @entity32 jew , ostracised and under threat , he was n’t allowed inside the building			0
now , in 1944 with war raging around him as the @entity37 routed the @entity2 troops , @entity0 , who had fled @entity8 and was now an @entity40 gi , knew his discovery of the precious icon - one of five million art works looted by @entity45 ’s troops - would be saved for posterity			1
in all , that one cache of stolen paintings contained 900 stolen works , among them the precious @entity51 , a medieval panel painting of the baby @entity53 and @entity54 by @entity32 artist @entity55			2
all had been stashed by @entity45 ’s troops after their rampage across @entity57			0
their value was incalculable - one , alone , a self - portrait by @entity61 artist @entity60 , is worth £ 60m today			0
all had been destined for @entity45 , but even now with the @entity64 teetering , the fanatical @entity8 leader had ordered the irreplaceable iconic works should all be destroyed			0
in a few weeks time @entity0 , 88 , who now lives in @entity66 and is one of the few remaining members of the @entity68 , will finally be awarded the @entity69 for his bravery			1
the highest award to a civilian for an act of heroism that contributed to @entity40 ’s history , the medal will seal forever the brave and unflinching sacrifices he and his 350 colleagues made to ensure @entity45 ’s plan to destroy the majority of @entity57 ’s priceless art works was foiled			1
but it is n’t the only honour that @entity0 has received			1
@entity85 ’s iconic film @entity86 , depicting the men ’s heroic story , has now been released on dvd and blue - ray			1
directed by and starring @entity85 , as well as a star - studded cast including @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , it paints a vivid account of the heroism of the 400 or so art historians , museum directors and art curators - all more familiar with a @entity101 than a machine gun - who became entangled in a dramatic race against time in their bid to save some 1,000 years of culture			1
@entity0 pictured with his late wife @entity108 , who died 10 years ago			1
@entity0 is portrayed in the film by @entity111 actor @entity110 , but his character is renamed @entity113 although he fled @entity8 just prior to @entity114 , he said it was not hard to take up arms against his home country ‘ watching the film was such a humbling experience , ’ says @entity0 , a widower who has lived alone since his beloved wife @entity108 died 10 years ago			1
‘ it brought the powerful message that , not only did @entity45 want to annihilate an entire race , but he wanted its culture wiped from the face of the earth too			0
‘ i went back to the @entity127 two years ago and memories came flooding back			0
it was n’t hard for me to take arms against my home country			0
the day i left @entity8 i was no longer @entity32			0
' i have been an @entity40 citizen since i was 19 and i am an @entity40 patriot			0
i will never forget the bravery of the men			2
those @entity136 men , such as the @entity138 historian @entity137 ( played in @entity86 by @entity139 ) who was killed by a shell burst while trying to rescue a medieval altar from a church in @entity143 in @entity8 in march 1945			0
' and @entity40 architect @entity144 who was gunned down trying to rescue an altar piece near @entity146			0
’ an art lover from an early age , @entity0 is pictured with a @entity16 self portrait he helped recover the @entity150 film , featuring @entity93 , left , and actor and director @entity85 , right , is based loosely on the exploits of @entity0 who helped reclaim about 900 boxes of art stolen by the @entity2 the @entity150 is based on @entity157 ’s book charting the men ’s success			1
as a young man in @entity161 in 1996 @entity157 began to wonder how many great masterpieces had survived @entity114			1
his research into the men ’s unit became a labour of love			0
when @entity85 read his work he , too , became passionate about turning the incredible story into a film			1
these men , @entity85 realised , had been air brushed from history			1
‘ @entity85 helped me to lobby for the medal to be awarded to the few remaining men , such as @entity0 , ’ @entity157 says			1
‘ i had the honour of breaking the news of the award to @entity0			1
he looked just like a child who had seen @entity180			0
’ @entity0 , pictured left with @entity136 actor @entity110 and @entity85 , and right , with the wider film crew @entity0 and his parents and siblings were among the last @entity32 jews who managed to escape @entity8			1
his father , who helped run a women ’s fashion store realised that soon the persecution would go far beyond merely his shop being boycotted			0
the @entity150 was released in february this year and features a star studded cast that includes @entity85 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity193 , @entity139 and @entity95			2
the film is based on the book ' @entity86 : @entity196 , @entity197 and the @entity198 in @entity199 ' by @entity157 and grossed almost £ 91 million at the box office			2
it follows the team tasked with finding and saving thousand of important pieces of art and culture before the @entity2 could destroy them at the end of the war			1
although it was called the @entity210 , @entity85 's character assembles a team to enter @entity57 in the hope to identifying , finding and saving the valuable artwork which is nicknamed ' @entity86 '			1
@entity0 is played by @entity136 actor @entity110 in the film , although the character is only loosely based on him and is renamed @entity113			1
increasingly the family was ostracised and when neigbouring @entity32 made it clear the @entity0 family was not wanted he moved swiftly			1
@entity0 joined the @entity40 army at 19 , becoming an infantry man			2
but his fluency in his native tongue meant he was asked to join the @entity150			0
in the film his story inspired the character of @entity113 , played by @entity227 actor , @entity228			2
after the war @entity0 travelled back to @entity8 , hoping to find some of his own family ’s art treasures which had been stored in a warehouse in @entity233			1
he travelled with a @entity235 survivor and recalls : ‘ when we found the warehouse , my grandfather ’s art was there			2
but our jeep broke down and we had to stay the night			0
we ended up in the top suite of the best hotel in town			0
there we were , a @entity246 soldier and a @entity235 survivor			0
sleeping in a bed meant for the @entity32 kaiser			0
i ’m proud of that			0
’ he had the family heirlooms shipped back to @entity40 and , today , one piece he saved is still displayed on the wall of his apartment : a print of that @entity16 self portrait			0
‘ it reminds me of what we achieved and the sacrifices that people like my buddies made			2
‘ @entity265 offered me £ 500,000			0
but because of the proud memories it brings back it is beyond price to me			0

@entity0 fled the @entity2 then returned to help recover stolen art work
@entity114 hero 's story made into a @entity275 film featuring @entity85
@entity0 will soon be awarded the @entity69 for bravery
