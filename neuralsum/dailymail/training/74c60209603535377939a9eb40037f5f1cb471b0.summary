by @entity1 reporter the captain of the @entity5 women 's hockey team threw out the first pitch at thursday 's series finale between the @entity8 and the @entity9 at @entity9 's @entity10 , and the @entity12 native used her moment in the spotlight to take a dig at shamed @entity8 pitcher @entity16			1
@entity16 was suspended this week for 10 games after he was caught with pine tar on his neck in the second inning of wednesday night 's game between the two rival clubs - the sticky substance is a big no - no for @entity26 pitchers as the league believes it can give them an unfair advantage			1
so when @entity30 took the mound at @entity10 on thursday to deliver the first pitch , she had a little fun at @entity16 's expense			1
comedian : @entity30 mocks @entity8 pitcher @entity16 by reaching for her neck in the same spot umpires found illegal pine tar on the @entity8 pitcher last laugh : the @entity8 got the last laugh thursday , beating the @entity9 14 - 5 just before she threw her pitch , @entity30 jokingly reached to her neck in the same area where the pine tar was found on @entity16			1
the @entity8 got the last laugh , however , spanking the @entity9 14 - 5 for the team 's fifth win against @entity9 so far this season			1
@entity16 was ejected in the second inning of wednesday night 's 5 - 1 loss at @entity10 after umpires found the pine tar on his neck			1
after the game , @entity16 admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool , windy night			1
' i 'll learn from this mistake , ' he said			0
' it wo n't happen again			0
' pine tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the handles of their bats to improve grip			1
pitchers will use it for the same reason , particularly in cold weather			0
however , @entity26 rules say that a pitcher ca n't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball			1
so pitchers will often try and hide it			0
if they get caught , they are typically thrown out of the game - and that 's exactly what happened to @entity16			2
@entity16 walked from the mound without protest			2
both @entity16 and @entity86 said it was pine tar			1
' when it 's that obvious , something has got to be said , ' @entity91 explained after the game			0

rule 8.02 ( b ) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage , and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound			1
@entity16 was n't seen with the pine tar in the first inning , when the @entity9 roughed him up			1
@entity9 manager @entity91 asked plate umpire @entity86 to check @entity16 after two fast outs the next inning			2
got ya : umpire @entity86 determined that the substance on @entity16 's neck was pine tar , which is against the rules for pitchers earlier this month , @entity16 pitched well against the @entity9 at @entity134			1
television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â € ” @entity16 said it was dirt , not pine tar			1
among other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade , @entity145 's @entity144 was penalized eight games in 2012 , the @entity141 ' @entity140 10 days in 2005 and @entity143 ' @entity142 10 days in 2004			1
the suspensions of @entity140 and @entity142 were cut to eight days after they asked the players ' association to appeal , and @entity144 dropped his challenge with no reduction			0
@entity8 general manager @entity155 said @entity16 and the organization were ' embarrassed			2
' @entity8 manager @entity157 called it ' an error in judgment ' and a ' little bump ' and ' poor judgment			0
' ' he had a hard time gripping the baseball			0
unknown to us , he put it on and went out there , ' @entity157 said			0
' it 's a young kid			0
i do n't think he 's trying to do anything , cheat			0
i think he 's just trying to go out there and compete			0
' obvious : @entity9 manager @entity91 said that when it 's as obvious as it was on @entity16 , he has to alert the umpires in @entity16 's previous start against the @entity9 , a 4 - 1 @entity8 win in @entity181 on april 10 , television cameras caught @entity16 with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night			1
@entity91 did n't see a photograph of @entity16 's hand until the fourth inning ; when @entity16 came out to warm up for the fifth , his hand was clean			1
@entity16 said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers ' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights			2
on wednesday , with the game time temperature at 50 degrees , @entity197 started the first with a triple and scored on @entity202 's single			2
with one out , @entity203 singled @entity202 to third			0
