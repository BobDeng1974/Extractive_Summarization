@entity0 spoke of his relief at securing his @entity3 future on thursday night – and warned that he is now in the perfect frame of mind to fight a battle on four fronts			1
the impasse between the 31 - year - old and the club was ended when the midfielder signed a two - year deal to kill off former manager @entity14 ’s hopes of luring him to @entity15 under freedom of contract			1
commons , who @entity14 signed from @entity19 in 2011 , had looked to be on the way out of the club due to @entity3 ’s initial unwillingness to offer him a straight two - year deal			1
@entity0 is relieved to have signed a new two - year contract with @entity3 the @entity26 - born star underscored his worth to the club when he scored a spectacular second goal in sunday ’s @entity29 semi-final win over @entity31			1
and the club broke with recent policy for players over 30 by agreeing a deal which keeps him at @entity36 until 2017			2
commons said : ‘ it ’s a great feeling			0
it ’s a huge burden off my shoulders			0
now i can concentrate on the proper stuff which is playing football and winning trophies at this club			2
‘ i ’m delighted to be staying here			0
it ’s been a strange couple of months			0
speculation is never good for the mind when you are trying to concentrate on playing at the top level			0
@entity52 and @entity3 feel like home to myself and my family			2
‘ that ’s credit to the people of @entity52 and how they ’ve welcomed us right from the word go			0
it ’s a very family orientated club and it ’s a massive relief for myself and my family that our future is secure now			1
‘ i want to win more league titles here			0
it would be wonderful if we could add a few more cups to the cabinet but i think when you think of @entity3 it ’s all about @entity70 football and if we can get into the @entity71 again next year and hopefully the year after that it would be a huge achievement for us			1
the 31 - year - old was @entity3 's top scorer last season with 31 goals in all competitions ‘ the @entity77 game will be a big draw with a full house under the floodlights			1
that ’s always a magical experience so hopefully we can turn up for that game and give them a sense of what we are all about			0
‘ that ’s a good game to look forward to			0
but we ’re involved in all four competitions so hopefully we ’ll have a very successful year			0
’ the reigning @entity90 and @entity91 player of the year , commons scored 31 goals in @entity14 ’s final year in @entity52			2
but , despite his popularity with the fans , a string of substitute appearances at the outset of @entity97 ’s reign gave fuel to the theory that he was n’t in the @entity104 ’s long - term plans			0
@entity97 not only denied that , he predicted that @entity0 would remain at the club throughout the contract impasse			1
manager @entity97 has spoken of his delight that @entity0 has committed his future to the club @entity97 said : ‘ i am really pleased that @entity0 has committed his future to the club			1
‘ he is someone who has already made a great contribution to @entity3 and i am sure he will continue to be a very important player for us as we work hard to bring our fans the success they deserve			2
” ‘ we have had a good week after reaching the @entity29 final and following the fantastic signings of @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity0 ’s contract extension is even more great news for the club and our supporters			1

@entity0 speaks of relief at signing two - year deal with @entity3
the 31 - year - old future at the club was *uncertain* over new contract
he warns he is now in perfect frame of mind to battle on four fronts
