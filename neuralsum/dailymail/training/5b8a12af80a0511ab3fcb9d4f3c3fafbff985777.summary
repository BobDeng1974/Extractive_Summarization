a grieving mother has been asked to tear down a shrine to her stillborn baby daughter after council officials ruled it was not ' in keeping ' with the rural graveyard where it is situated			1
@entity7 , 24 , covered daughter @entity9 's grave in pink stones , put up a border fence and decorated it with children 's toys after the baby died following a 39 - week pregnancy last august			1
miss @entity7 said the feeling of doing something for her lost child helps to comfort her and partner @entity19 , 29 , but they have now been ordered to tear it down			1
@entity7 , 24 , has been asked to remove this shrine to her stillborn daughter from a graveyard in @entity25 , @entity26 , by council chiefs who say it breaches regulations the grave , which is inscribed with neon pink writing , features matching neon pink gravel , flowers , a series of children 's toys , and a photograph of her stillborn daughter wearing a pink onesie			1
council chiefs in @entity40 , @entity26 , have warned that she has until saturday to comply otherwise they will call in a team to do it themselves			1
a letter from @entity44 said that ' trinkets and lights ' placed on the grave violated rules at the council - owned cemetery			1
miss @entity7 , a supermarket assistant , said : ' it 's not got any lanterns so there 's no light bothering anyone , it 's not got wind chimes so there 's no noise bothering anyone			1
' as far as i am aware there have been no complaints from anyone about it			0
' it 's just a pink little grave for a little girl and i think they need to remember it was a little baby girl and her room was prepared full of her teddies and had pink walls and pink curtains			2
' we just tried to make her grave as much like her room would have been as we could			2
' they want to take it off her grave to make the mower 's job easier , well i want to have that stuff on the grave because it 's not even been six months since i lost my daughter			2
' that 's how me and my partner cope , it 's going down there and doing stuff for her garden			0
it makes us feel like she still needs us , she still needs us to do stuff for her			0
' if that 's taken away it 's like she 's being taken away from us all over again , because then she does n't need me anymore			0
councillors wrote to @entity101 and partner @entity19 telling them that the ' trinkets and lights ' around the grave are not in keeping with the cemetry 's appearance , and giving them until saturday to remove them miss @entity7 has refused to clear the tribute away , and has now got together a petition of 3,000 signatures asking for her to be allowed to keep the shrine in place ' they have n't handled it at all sensitively , and i feel angry about that because i just feel that if they had done their jobs properly and informed me about the rules in the first place then i would n't have had to go through all this heartache			1
' the support has been amazing and i think a lot of the people are thinking that if they lost a child they would want to feel that they would be able to do whatever helps them to mourn			2
' instead of complying with the council 's request , @entity101 and her friend , @entity132 , have drawn up a petition signed by 3,000 people asking councillors to back down			0
miss @entity132 said : ' when you lose someone you love it leaves a huge well of pain and hurt inside of you			0
sometimes having a grave for them gives you something to do to keep busy ; something to focus on			2
' simple things like erecting a border filled with stones and putting ornaments down can make you feel like you are actively doing something for them			0
' your signature might mean that @entity7 can have the beautiful garden she has created for her daughter			1
' @entity7 said she chose the council - run @entity154 because the village 's other cemetery , at @entity156 , did not have any room			1
explaining the council 's decision , chairman @entity160 said : ' we have a whole range of people buried there , they could be children , elderly people or parents			0
' we have a set of rules that were drawn up in order that we could provide some commonality at all places , sensitivity , and a private place where the majority of people can visit in quiet tranquility			0
' he said that he ' did not anticipate ' the council changing its rules and added : ' if we changed the rules it means there could be a big debate about what is allowed and what is n't , we could have a list of things			0
