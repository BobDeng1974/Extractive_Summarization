it was mrs @entity39 who helped pour a pot of warm water over @entity5 's head as part of the challenge , which has raised more than £ 3.2million for the @entity46			1
' @entity5 has loved the attention since the video has gone around the world , ' she said			1
' she might be just three but she already knows what she wants			1
she would love to be a singer or a rapper			1
we ’re going to try and get her on @entity13 ’s @entity12			2
' she might try out as a rapper but she ’ll have to watch her language considering it ’s a family show ! ' @entity5 begged her grandparents to take part in the challenge			1
they agreed but insisted on warm water back for more : @entity5 has a second go at the challenge - this time with a smile on her face polite : mrs @entity39 joked the three - year - old would have to watch her language on the television show she added : ' i think she ’d do well on the show , she ’s got great stage presence and is confident as anything			1
' i ’ve been on the @entity13 ’s @entity12 website and i ’m putting her name down			2
i know the auditions start next year			2
' i would do it for her			2

' children have brains like sponges and i ca n't stop it			0
but she does know it 's wrong			0
