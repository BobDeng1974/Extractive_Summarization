a former soldier is suing a hospital in @entity2 after he went to have a kidney operation and ended up having his penis amputated			1
@entity5 , 55 , had gone to the @entity6 in the town of @entity8 in eastern @entity2 suffering from kidney failure			1
although the operation , carried out by surgeon dr @entity12 , was successful , a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly , causing mr @entity5 's genitalia to become severely infected and leaving doctors with no option but to remove the penis in order to save his life			1
victim : @entity5 , 55 , had gone to the @entity6 in the town of @entity8 in eastern @entity2 suffering from kidney failure but an incorrectly - fitted catheter left his penis severely infected speaking of the botched catheter fitting , mr @entity5 said : ' after the operation they told me there were some complications			1
apparently the nurse had not properly fitted a small plastic pipe to help me urinate , and my penis became red and infected			1
' i was moved to intensive care and four days later was moved to the nephrology department where they took a sample , but then they just left me there for 10 days			0
eventually they did an operation , but then doctor went on holiday			2
' shortly afterwards mr @entity5 was transferred to the @entity43			1
there he underwent a series of examinations with doctors concluding that the only thing they could do was to amputate the infected penis , otherwise there was a strong possibility he would die			2
a spokesman for the hospital said : ' the foreskin was stripped away completely and most of the cells in the organ were dead			0
' the member was black and the only remaining skin was at the base of the shaft and highly infectious			0
it was recommended to remove the necrotic elements , meaning amputation			2
' surgeon : although the operation , carried out by dr @entity12 ( pictured ) , was successful , a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly , causing mr @entity5 's genitalia to become severely infected speaking of this shock after the operation , mr @entity5 said : ' it was totally cut off			1
now i urinate through an orifice that doctors made between my anus and my testicles			2
' i urinate just like a woman			0
' now the former soldier is demanding £ 362,450 compensation from the original hospital for malpractice			1
he said : ' if they had n't botched things up at the beginning this would n't have happened			0
' but professor @entity87 , head of @entity2 's @entity88 said : ' i 'm not sure he will win by saying he is devastated and has to go to the toilet like a woman			2
' it depends on the patient 's image of himself			0
if you cut my right hand with me being a surgeon , i will be devastated			0
if you cut the left hand of a violinist , he will be devastated , ' he said			0
' but should he be devastated by the loss of his penis ? i would say the man needs to be evaluated by a psychologist , ' he added .			0
