@entity11 , 39 , was charged after her estranged husband found the dead body of an infant in their garage
she is charged with killing six *newborns* in @entity4 and faces five years to life on each count of *felony* murder .
six of the seven children were born alive and @entity17 has *reportedly* admitted to either strangling or suffocating them all
*neighbors* noticed she gained and lost weight through the years but never suspected that she was *pregnant*
investigators do not believe the husband , who had just arrived home from prison , had any knowledge of the killings
