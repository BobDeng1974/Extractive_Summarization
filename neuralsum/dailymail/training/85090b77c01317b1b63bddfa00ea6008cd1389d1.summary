by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:33 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 02:44 est , 8 october 2012 @entity3 sweeps into the @entity5 conference today with a direct challenge to @entity7 to stand up for the ‘ struggling middle ’ who he claims are being ignored			1
the mayor of @entity12 arrives in @entity13 with a fresh attack on government policy towards cash - strapped working families , in a move which will fuel speculation about his hopes of challenging mr @entity7 for the leadership			1
with the @entity21 stung by criticism that it is giving millionaires a tax cut at a time of deep austerity , mr @entity3 launched a staunch defence of families struggling with living costs who are ‘ feeling utterly and understandably ignored ’			1
swashbuckling arrival : @entity12 mayor @entity3 ( left , pictured last thursday ) called last night for @entity33 prime minister @entity7 's ( pictured yesterday ) government to do more to boost growth mr @entity3 last night refused to say if mr @entity7 was a better prime minister than he would be , insisting the claim was ‘ unverifiable ’			1
the @entity12 mayor - branded a ‘ blond - haired mop ’ by his party leader yesterday - made a typically swashbuckling arrival at the @entity5 conference by also demanding a referendum on @entity39 , saying he does n’t know what the current @entity5 policy is			1
he called for the government to do more to boost growth , warning it is ‘ heading for disaster ’ by failing to build a hub airport			2
he also positioned himself as the champion of the ‘ struggling middle ’ who are feeling ‘ utterly ignored ’			2
in a newspaper article today , he says middle - class families earning between £ 30,000 and £ 64,000 a year face many difficulties with everyday life , especially housing costs			1
he writes : ‘ they are feeling utterly and understandably ignored			2
it is time to help them			0
’ mr @entity3 made clear yesterday that he would like the top job after his mayoral term is up in 2016 , insisting it was healthy that he is in ‘ competition ’ with mr @entity7 , an @entity66 and @entity67 contemporary			1
the mayor repeatedly refused to say whether mr @entity7 is a better leader than he would be			2
but he did concede : ‘ i ’ll tell you what i ’ll say			0
he ’s a better prime minister than @entity72 will ever be			1
’ pressed to admit that mr @entity7 was better than him , the mayor told @entity75 ’s politics on @entity76 : ‘ i think it ’s unverifiable			1
’ mr @entity3 said his rival was ‘ doing a fantastic job ’ and pointed out that he had urged mr @entity7 to run for the @entity5 leadership			1
party colleagues : @entity3 ( left ) said his rival was ' doing a fantastic job ' and pointed out that he had urged @entity7 ( right ) to run for the @entity5 leadership			1
they are pictured together in august but he was prepared to say only that mr @entity7 had been a better choice in 2005 , a time when mr @entity3 had been forced to resign from the @entity5 front bench and was in no position to challenge for the leadership			1
‘ it ’s self - evidently true that in 2005 , i thought he was the man for the job and i did n’t think i was the man for the job , ’ he said			2
‘ i want to be mayor of @entity12			0
after four years is up , heaven knows			0
’ mr @entity3 used his newspaper column to complain that for many people in @entity12 and the @entity99 , even those with incomes from £ 30,000 to £ 64,000 , struggle to buy a home near where they work and are priced out of the market for even modest properties			1
‘ we need to think how to target this group — the struggling middle — that is currently not being helped , and that is so vital for the economy , ’ he wrote in the @entity105			0
a ‘ huge chunk ’ of new houses are built as ‘ affordable homes ’ and ‘ another sizeable chunk [ was ] of top - end stuff – swish houses and apartments , often for foreign buyers ’			2
it what will be seen as a direct challenge to mr @entity7 ’s government , he adds : ‘ we are not doing as the @entity123 did , and providing new stock to be bought by the people in the middle – on household incomes from £ 30,000 to £ 64,000 ; and they are feeling utterly and understandably ignored			2
‘ they can not get the mortgages they would need , not at current prices , and not with lenders in their current mood			0
‘ they have to live at a great distance from their place of work , and spend huge quantities on travel and hardly get to see their children in the evenings			0
’ tensions have been clear in the relationship between the two men for years but they have flared in recent weeks after the mayor repeatedly upstaged the prime minister at the @entity148			1
' it ’s self - evidently true that in 2005 , i thought he was the man for the job and i did n’t think i was the man for the job			2
i want to be mayor of @entity12			0
after four years is up , heaven knows ' @entity7 , @entity12 mayor but mr @entity3 said : ‘ if senior politicians were endlessly pally and friendly with each other and there was no element of competition , i think people would think it was a plot against the electorate			1
’ mr @entity7 yesterday insisted there was ‘ no point trying to contain @entity3 ’			1
in an interview he said : ‘ he will always speak his mind			0
he ’s mayor of @entity12 , he can speak out if he wants to			0
so i am relatively relaxed about having the blond - haired mop sounding off from time to time			1
’ later , mr @entity7 said he did not think being mayor would be mr @entity3 ’s last job			1
‘ i have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome			0
i like having other people in the @entity5 who are popular , who get out there , talk our message and explain our vision and values , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity3 is fantastic like that			2
he is one of those politicians people warm to and i think it is great that we have in our party figures like that			0
i have said to @entity3 , “ once you have done your job as @entity12 mayor , do n’t think your job in politics is over ”			2
thumbs up : mr @entity7 and mr @entity3 cheer during the @entity192 in september ‘ i think he has got a huge amount to offer , a huge amount to give and i encourage him to do that			1
i think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor			0
’ but in comments likely to woo the @entity201 , mr @entity3 made clear he wants a referendum in @entity33 on any future @entity204 treaty			1
mr @entity7 ’s position is that such a referendum will be necessary only if it transfers powers from @entity208 to @entity209			2
but the mayor indicated that he thinks changes in the eurozone would affect the @entity33 and should be put to a vote here regardless			0
' i have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome			0
i like having other people in the @entity5 who are popular , who get out there , talk our message and explain our vision and values ' @entity7 , prime minister in a second dig at the pm , mr @entity3 suggested the prime minister ’s efforts to explain his position on @entity39 remain unclear and took a dig at mr @entity7 ’s abandonment of his ‘ cast iron promise ’ to hold a referendum on the @entity233			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t know exactly what the position is now			0
i think we were promised a referendum on the @entity233			0
my strong view is that it would be right to consult the people on any further constitutional changes within the @entity204			0
‘ if they do go forward as a consequence of the difficulties surrounding the euro with a new settlement , a fiscal union or there are big changes to the treaty which will inevitably affect us ... then i do think that must be put to the people of this country			0
it should be put in the form of a referendum on that particular treaty			0
’ last week mr @entity3 claimed @entity259 ’s slow progress in addressing aviation capacity risked ‘ economic catastrophe ’			1
last night he repeated those concerns			0
‘ i do think there ’s a major problem , ’ he said			0
‘ unless we make sure that we both increase our aviation capacity and close down the third runway at @entity269 option , i think we are heading for a disaster			0

@entity272 arrives at @entity5 conference today positioning himself as the champion of hard - pressed working families
@entity7 brands his rival a ' blond - haired mop '
