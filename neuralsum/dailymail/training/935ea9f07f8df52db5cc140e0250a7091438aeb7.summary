by @entity1 reporter published : 21:01 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 21:03 est , 20 march 2013 relatives of @entity4 bomb victims tonight vowed to relentlessly pursue the £ 1.6 million in damages that the men found liable for the attack have been ordered to pay			1
their pledge came after two republicans were ruled responsible for the 1998 atrocity at the close of a landmark civil case in @entity14			2
the families insisted they had also not given up on securing a criminal conviction for the dissident republican outrage that claimed the lives of 29 people , including a woman pregnant with twins			2
@entity22 and @entity23 , both from the @entity24 , had faced a retrial after they successfully appealed against a finding of liability made against them and two other republicans at the end of the original civil case four years ago			1
trial : @entity22 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) were ruled as being among the men responsible for the @entity36 attack but their second trial delivered the same outcome in the same court , with judge mr justice @entity41 today ruling the men were responsible for the @entity36 attack			1
between them , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity36 chief @entity43 and republican @entity44 owe the 12 bereaved relatives who took the case £ 1.6 million			1
however , the decade - long civil action , which could still be subject to another appeal , is estimated to have cost the taxpayer many millions more in legal aid and court bills			1
@entity53 , whose wife @entity54 was killed , said the families were determined to make the four men pay up			0
' when you go before a court and you are fined for whatever you do , you pay your fine , you pay your debt to society , whatever you do , so why should these people get away , why should these people live in the lap of luxury ? ' he said outside court			2
@entity67 ( left ) , who lost his son @entity69 , and @entity70 who lost his wife @entity72 , in the @entity4 bomb attack , stand outside @entity14 where @entity22 and @entity23 were found liable for the bombing following a landmark civil action taken by relatives of some of the victims @entity67 , whose 21 - year - old son @entity79 died in the blast , said retrieving the damages would send a signal to terrorists contemplating similar acts of violence			1
' we feel that the judgment that we were granted here in 2009 would be a very hollow judgment if the law was n’t seen to be carried through and that the people that we were given a judgment against were n’t pursued , that will be pursued of course , ' he said			0
' that would be the deterrent for others not to pursue terrorism			0
' mr @entity67 said the families ’ campaign for a full cross-border public inquiry into the bombing would go on and he urged the police on both sides of the border to examine the @entity14 judgment for evidential opportunities			0
no one has been successfully criminally convicted of the attack			0
' we have not given up on criminal conviction , ' he said			0
the devastation caused by the bomb explosion in @entity112 , @entity4 , @entity113 , @entity114 ' that ’s really what we wanted in the first place and sadly it was left up to the families to get a result and to hold people to account for this crime			0
' not all the @entity4 victims ’ families supported the @entity14 action , with some claiming it was a waste of time that would not deliver a prison sentence			2
at the conclusion of the original civil case , the families ’ groundbreaking action had already cost them an estimated £ 2 million , with more than £ 750,000 provided in the form of ' special status ' legal aid granted by the government			1
they were supported in their efforts to raise funds for the court case by former @entity141 president @entity140 , former @entity114 secretaries @entity142 and sir @entity143 , as well as musician @entity144 and boxing champion @entity145			2
mr @entity67 predicted the overall cost of the action , factoring in legal aid on both sides and the added costs of the appeal and retrial , was ' tens of millions '			1
' certainly i want to know the total cost of this trial and all the subsequent appeals and trials , ' he said			2
' we think it is scandalous that so much money , it has cost so much money to get justice for the families			0
' every time we meet politicians and ask for a public inquiry they always cite the fact it ’s going to cost too much money and take too long , well this process has now taken 11 years and has cost tens of millions of pounds			1
' @entity22 , a builder and publican from @entity172 , @entity173 , and @entity23 , a bricklayer from @entity174 , @entity175 , were found liable along with @entity43 and @entity44 in the initial civil judgment in 2009			1
@entity43 , who is serving a 20 - year prison sentence in the @entity178 for directing terrorism , and @entity44 , who recently successfully fought extradition proceedings to @entity181 on arms smuggling charges , failed in their bids to overturn the @entity4 civil judgment			1
they are now seeking to have their case heard in the @entity190			0
@entity22 and @entity23 ’s appeals were upheld but both men were ordered to face another trial			1
the retrial started in january and finished last month , with mr @entity195 delivering his reserved judgment today			0
neither defendant was in court for the judgment			0
both men also declined to give evidence during the trial .			0

@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity36 chief @entity43 and republican @entity44 owe the 12 bereaved relatives who took the case £ 1.6 million
decade - long civil action , which could still be subject to another appeal , is estimated to have cost the taxpayer many millions in legal aid and court bills
