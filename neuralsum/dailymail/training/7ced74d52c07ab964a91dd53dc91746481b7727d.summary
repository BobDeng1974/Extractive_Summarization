in recent years a handful of ' hybrid ' animals have been spotted in the @entity2 , such as this polar bear @entity5 hybrid in recent years a handful of ' hybrid ' animals have been spotted in the @entity2 but the number of these animals is set to increase , according to scientists			1
@entity12 researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change and now an artist has created images of what the animals at risk of crossbreeding might look like			1
the scientists believe that as @entity2 sea ice melts increasingly quickly , different species of animals such as bears and seals , which were previously kept apart by huge slabs of ice , are now mingling freely and breeding with each other			1
in 2006 a white bear with brown patches thought to be a hybrid of a polar and grizzly bear was killed by @entity2 hunters , while a hybrid of a white and a bowhead whale was sighted in the @entity37 four years ago			2
while crossbreeding might seem like a clever survival tactic , scientists from the @entity39 have said that hybrid animals are often infertile			1
in 2006 a white bear with brown patches thought to be a hybrid of a polar and grizzly bear ( illustrations of cubs are pictured ) was killed by @entity2 hunters the @entity49 ( right ) and @entity50 ( left ) species of seal both breed on pack ice of the @entity55 and extend into the @entity56 in summer months so they could easily meet and produce a hybrid pup the scientists said a hybrid animal ( illustrated ) has already been confirmed by molecular analysis consequently the trend is worrying as cross breeding could drive certain species to extinction as they are no longer able to mate with their own kind , @entity62 reported			1
the university 's study of 34 species that are at risk of cross breeding was published in the journal nature in 2010			0
artist @entity75 has created images of what hybrid @entity2 animals might look like if they did breed together and the results in some cases are quite subtle			1
@entity12 researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change			1
@entity85 ( left ) and narwhals ( right ) both inhabit the @entity56 and peripheral seas pictured is the imagined @entity91 hybrid			0
a skull intermediate in morphology was collected in @entity94 in the 1980s			0
local hunters reported seeing other whales of intermediate form in the region he was helped by writer and biologist dr @entity102 who described the features that the hybrid animals might have based on the dominant features of their distinct original species			1
dr @entity107 shared his knowledge of the real hybrid animals sighted and photographed in the wild , to inform mr @entity75 's creations			1
they include a hybrid of the harp seal and hooded seal , which appears to combine the two species ' colouring			2
polar bears ( left ) may spend more time ashore rather than on sea ice , where they will increasingly encounter brown bears ( right ) , some of which are expanding northward , according to scientists polar , brown and grizzly bear hybrids have been noted in captivity and confirmed by molecular analysis in the wild			0
pictured is an illustration of a brown and polar bear hybrid animal both types of seal breed on pack ice of the @entity55 and extend into the @entity56 in summer months so they could easily meet and breed			0
the scientists said a hybrid animal has already been confirmed by molecular analysis and diminishing ice will encourage the species to overlap			2
dr @entity107 and other researchers also noted that a hybrids of the harbour porpoise and @entity145 's porpoise have been found off the coast of @entity147 , @entity148			0
harbor seals ( left ) range widely in temperate and @entity151 waters of the @entity152 and @entity55 and north into the @entity37 and @entity153			0
a ringed seal is pictured right the two species likely will move north where they will increasingly overlap with ringed seals , breeding to create a hybrid perhaps like the one illustrated it is thought that this cross breeding occurred because of a very small population of @entity164 porpoises , which are found in temperate to boreal seas in the @entity55 and @entity152			0
experts believe this species will move north as temperatures rise , which will further increase their chances of breeding with @entity145 's porpoises , which are found in the @entity152 harbour porpoises ( left ) are found in temperate to boreal seas in the @entity55 and @entity152 and will likely move north			0
@entity145 's @entity172 ( right ) are found in the @entity152 up to 65 Â° n extensive hybridisation off the coast of @entity147 , @entity148 , has been attributed to locally low densities of @entity164 porpoises			0
similar hybridisation may occur as the species interact in newly - colonized @entity2 habitats where initial densities are likely to be low , scientists said			2
a hybrid is illustrated one of the most intriguing images of possible hybrid animals created by mr @entity75 , is the @entity91 , @entity186 hybrid , which curiously does not have the narwhal 's famous tusk			1
both species live in the @entity56 and peripheral seas and a skull of a hybrid animals was collected in @entity94 in the 1980s , while local hunters have also reported seeing whales of intermediate form in the region .			2

in recent years a handful of ' hybrid ' animals have been spotted in the @entity2 and their numbers are set to increase
scientists from the @entity39 blamed the *problem* on climate change and said infertile hybrids could lead to the extinction of species
