it shows a middle - aged man clasping the hips of a woman in a party frock , pursued by a gyrating blonde with her arms aloft , all shimmying in single file across the dance floor			0
‘ @entity19 ’s grandpa @entity18 doing ? ’ the prince will innocently ask			0
‘ that ’s called the conga , @entity23 , ’ an aide explains			0
‘ it ’s a dance popular on package holidays and often performed by people imbibed of drink			0
’ party time : @entity18 joined a conga line at a @entity32 @entity31 gala event in @entity33 celebrities : mr @entity18 danced his way past legendary footballer and football manager @entity36 good - hearted : the presence of the @entity39 at the charity ball suggested that their daughter @entity41 inherited her charitable streak from them big spender : mr @entity18 handed over £ 20 notes to a fundraiser who was dressed as a nurse @entity50 of @entity2 ’s father @entity51 was taking part in the dance at a @entity32 @entity55 ’ fund - raising gala in @entity56			1
ten minutes before midnight , as a flamenco band played , the 64 - year - old sprang to his feet and joined a line of guests snaking its way around dinner tables at a @entity33 hotel , where the £ 350 - a - head event was staged			1
it weaved enthusiastically past celebrities and notables from a guest list that included @entity72 actor @entity71 and his wife @entity73 , actress @entity74 and a number of footballers			0
not to mention @entity77 , the mother of our queen - in - waiting			1
friendly : the @entity81 posing with @entity71 and his wife @entity73 elegant : mrs @entity77 was dressed in a black gown with a stylish grey throw support : mrs @entity77 with @entity86 , chairman of the @entity32 @entity31 's international fundraising ball : the event was held in the @entity90 , a hotel in @entity33 mrs @entity77 did not join the hand - to - hip hangers - on with her husband in the conga , a spectacle that @entity95 , perhaps , could fairly have described as a mildly embarrassing spot of ‘ dad - dancing ’			1
mr @entity18 – who once donned an inflatable sumo wrestler suit to surprise the family at @entity101 dinner – looked less confident when singled out by the gala compere and a roving microphone			2
but even after apparently sticking to soft drinks for much of the evening , he did hand over a generous wodge of £ 20 notes to a fundraiser dressed as a @entity31 nurse , and happily posed for photo with celebrity guests ( although in fairness , it might have been the other way around )			1
the event raised more than £ 240,000 for the @entity32 @entity31			2
getting in the spirit : mr @entity18 showed he was a good sport as he hit the dancefloor observer : mr @entity18 looks out at the goings - on in the star - studded party embarrassment : the @entity122 ' father cringes as he is singled out by the event 's compere daughter : @entity50 of @entity2 met a number of @entity128 members selling poppies yesterday @entity130 : the £ 350 - a - head event was held in a well - appointed ballroom in the luxury hotel dance : a group of dancers showed off their skills to the appreciative crowd			0
