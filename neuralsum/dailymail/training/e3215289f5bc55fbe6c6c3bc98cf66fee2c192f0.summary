but it also raised concerns about the privacy implications for @entity1 , which already collects rafts of data about users ' online habits			1
@entity11 , which lets users monitor homes and offices via its camera hardware and software , will adopt @entity18 's privacy policy after the acquisition , the latter company said in its blog post			1

the camera is controlled from a special app which can show live footage as well as zoom in on areas and show a night vision view			1
the move comes as @entity127 is preparing to turn the @entity128 into a universal ' home remote ' that could control everything from tvs to washing machines and lights , it has been claimed			1
the project is set to be unveiled alongside an entirely new version of @entity127 's @entity136 and @entity128 software at its @entity138 in @entity114 next week , according to the @entity139 an @entity127 patent published in november last year gave the first hints of the system , showing a system that automatically turned on lights when a user comes home			1

at tonight 's event , @entity193 is set to unveil the next - generation of mobile software , dubbed @entity196 8			0
although many of the changes are likely to incremental , the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called @entity201 , which is believed to have leaked last month ( pictured ) and is designed to track and monitor fitness ' these people say that the feature will allow @entity128 users to run and interact with two @entity128 applications at once			0
' current users can swap between apps , but can only see one on screen at a time			0
the new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures , for example , between apps			0
the blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger - screened @entity128 , which @entity127 is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015			1
@entity127 is also expected to unveil a major new app for the @entity136 and @entity128 aimed at collecting health data at the conference - as well as possibly unveiling dr @entity221 and @entity222 as its latest employees if the much rumoured acquisition of @entity226 goes head			1
called @entity201 , the new app is expected to be unveiled in june at @entity127 's annual developer conference			1
