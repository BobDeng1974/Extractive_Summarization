tax hikes in the last five years have raised an extra £ 16.4billion a year , equivalent of around £ 255 for every person in the @entity2			1
a new study by the @entity4 found that by 2015 - 16 , will have imposed tax rises worth £ 64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £ 48billion			1
the figures come ahead of @entity9 's final budget before the election , with @entity12 warning they lay bare the full extent of the government 's failure to fix the economy			2
chancellor @entity9 , pictured today , is expected to use his budget on wednesday to announce a nother increase in the personal tax allowance tax rises introduced since 2010 include a £ 14 billion hike in vat and a £ 5.2 billion increase in national insurance contributions			1
at the same time the tax reductions of 48 billion include £ 8 billion from raising the personal threshold for income tax , £ 5.9 billion in cuts to corporation tax and £ 3.9 billion from real - terms reductions in fuel duties			1
however , the @entity4 said the changes were a ' missed opportunity to improve the tax system ' , because they had been introduced in a piecemeal way with little attempt to address ' fundamental structural deficiencies '			1
several of the changes have exacerbated ' unwelcome distortions ' in the system , said the @entity4			1
it was difficult to find a ' good economic reason ' for lifting ever - more lower - paid workers out of income tax while leaving national insurance thresholds largely untouched , and it was an ' absurdity ' that the two taxes had not been integrated			2
mr @entity9 is expected to use @entity47 to announce another big rise in the personal tax allowance			1
deputy pm @entity50 said : ‘ the main thing the government can do is just take less of your money away from you			0
‘ i very much want to give the biggest possible workers ’ bonus to millions of people on middle and low incomes			0
' the study by the @entity4 found that by 2015 - 16 , will have imposed tax rises worth £ 64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £ 48billion the @entity4 highlighted the ' problematic ' failure to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation , and warned of a ' rapid ' increase in workers paying higher rates of income tax as the economy improves			1
unless the phenomenon known as ' fiscal drag ' is dealt with , the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will double within a decade , the report predicted			0
the report also warned that council tax had been allowed to get ' ever more out of date ' , with bands in @entity81 and @entity82 based on property prices in 1991			0
and it said that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had ' seen a stream of ad hoc , often temporary , announcements overtaking each other without a clear statement of principles or long - run intentions '			0
@entity12 's shadow chancellor @entity95 said the @entity97 idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else has n’t worked authors @entity103 and @entity105 said : ' there is a better way to make tax policy			0
the corporate tax road map was a good start , setting out a direction of travel and providing an element of predictability			0
the next government would be well advised to apply this approach to more elements of the tax system , and indeed to the tax system as a whole			2
' that would help taxpayers to plan , provide a benchmark for assessing the policies actually implemented , and facilitate debate on whether the strategy laid out is the right one			0
taking the time to articulate a strategy might even lead to the adoption of better tax policy			2
' @entity12 's shadow chancellor @entity95 told the @entity132 : ' the old @entity97 idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else has n’t worked			0
and once again , a @entity97 chancellor is giving with one hand but taking away much more with the other			0
' no pre-election tax cut can mask the £ 1,127 a year which the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) says families have lost because of tax and benefit changes since 2010 — from higher vat to cuts to tax credits			1

by 2015 - 16 *coalition* will have imposed tax rises worth £ 64.3 billion
at the same time tax cuts will have saved the country only £ 48billion
@entity4 *slams* ' missed opportunity ' to improve system
@entity9 expected to announce more tax cuts in @entity160 next week
