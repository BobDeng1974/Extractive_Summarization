but this season the team finished with a lackluster 16 - 16 record and are now losing all of their starting players			0

over the years , the president , first lady and daughters @entity63 and @entity65 have *attended* several @entity0 games
in 2012 , @entity1 helped secure his sister as commencement speaker for the @entity54 , @entity53 school
