by @entity0 what ’s that about @entity3 being a burial ground for legends ? maybe in @entity6 , but clearly not for those of the golfing kind			1
to general astonishment and a fair level of hysteria , @entity9 showed up here in the nick of time on wednesday and played the most watched nine - hole practice round in the history of the game			1
was this the man who could barely lift himself off a buggy after withdrawing from the @entity22 on sunday — the one whose hopes looked buried amid his latest injury setback ? fair play to his physio			1
whatever he gets paid , he is worth it			2
a vast amphitheatre behind the green can accommodate thousands of spectators with the entire hole visible			2
reachable in two but well protected by a lagoon that runs its whole length and a deep bunker at the front of a devilish horseshoe green			0
woods was in such good spirits he even spoke at length with the media before walking the back nine			1
‘ the only good thing about sunday night was that i knew the pain was in a different place from where i had my surgery , ’ he said			0
‘ what had happened is that the sacrum ( a triangular bone at the base of the spine ) had popped out and pinched a nerve			0
once my physio popped it back in the pain went away			1
i feel fit and yes , i think i can win			0
’ asked if there was a danger it could pop out again , he replied : ‘ sure			0
but you wo n’t find me jumping back into bunkers any more			1
’ woods did n’t play in the @entity85 here in 2008 because he was recovering from yet more injuries — his knee and a broken leg on that occasion — but it sounded like a @entity85 when he walked to the practice ground			1
he hit a 20 - yard chip and 10,000 people started cheering			2
whatever happens to him over the coming months as he strives for a decent level of fitness , there will clearly be no shortage of people wishing him well			0
after warming up with a little pitching and a few short irons , he reached for the driver			0
but he swung fairly hard and not only did it go straight , he did n’t collapse on his haunches			0
@entity108 , fresh from being chosen as one of @entity111 ’s @entity85 vice-captains , @entity106 skipper @entity105 and young @entity38 @entity107 accompanied @entity9 alongside the madding hordes — and that was just the media inside the ropes , wondering if they could trust their eyes			1
empty space : there were doubts the former world number one would make it to @entity3 @entity9 took a three - wood off the first tee and struck it true			1
the same with his iron approach and again at the second hole			0
at the third he played his first bunker shot in public since jarring his back while tumbling into the sand last sunday			2
but that went well too			0
he splashed out and holed the three - foot putt			2
beware the injured golfer ? we will find out soon enough , given he is out this morning at 8.35 ( 1.35pm @entity136 time ) in the company of two more greats struggling to keep pace — @entity140 and @entity141			2
‘ i think you saw out there that my speed through the ball is pretty good , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ it ’s nice coming back to a place where i won ( the 2000 @entity28 ) but the greens are completely different so all my notes are of no use			1
’ the presence of @entity108 was surely telling			0
people can say what they like about @entity9 and the @entity85 , but one of the reasons @entity9 is playing is surely to try to prove his health for @entity157 , and find some semblance of form			1
take it as read that @entity108 will be like a personal captain for him			0
woods admitted he wished he had been able to play a full practice round			2
then again , given where he was on sunday evening , it seems truly amazing that he ’s here at all			0
wherever you look , then , the game is certainly keeping us on the edges of our seats right now , is n’t it ? ca n’t wait for 8.35am			0
@entity173 day 4 highlights injury : woods injured his back playing this shot last week			1

@entity9 was a major doubt for the @entity38 @entity28 starting in @entity3 on *thursday*
former world no 1 *confirms* he will play through the risk if injury having suffered from back *problems*
the 14 - time @entity190 winner *'s* body appears to be paying the price for gruelling training *regime* of early *career*
