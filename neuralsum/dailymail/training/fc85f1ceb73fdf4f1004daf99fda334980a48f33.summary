by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 12 september 2013 @entity3 is risking potential ' man - made catastrophe ' by turning on an ageing nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium for weapons and bombs , @entity2 sources have warned			1
a @entity10 research institute has captured images of steam apparently rising from the five megawatt reactor at the @entity15 complex which was closed in 2007			1
but a senior @entity2 diplomat has claimed that the outdated reactor is in a ' nightmarish state ' and that the nation could face a potential nuclear disaster if it has been made operational again			0
full steam ahead ? this satellite image of the five megawatt ( electric ) reactor at the @entity15 facility was taken on august 31			1
steam is seen coming from the electrical power generation building satellite imagery has captured steam rising from the nuclear facility , suggesting its reactor has restarted , according to a @entity10 research institute the source told the @entity34 : ' our main concern is linked to a very likely man - made disaster as a consequence			1
' the reactor is in a nightmarish state , it is a design dating back to the 1950s			0
' for the @entity44 this could entail terrible consequences , if not a man - made catastrophe			0
' the reactor , which was completed in 1986 , was decommissioned as part of a disarmament agreement six years ago			1
but @entity3 vowed to restart the facility , around 50 miles north of @entity51 , in april amid a series of threats towards the @entity10 and @entity54 over its latest nuclear and rocket tests			1
now , satellite imagery from august 31 has captured steam rising from the nuclear facility - suggesting the reactor has restarted , according to the @entity10 - @entity61 at @entity62			1
the @entity10 envoy on @entity3 said that the reported restart of the reactor would be a ' serious misstep on the part of @entity3			1
' he added that such an action would breach the @entity71 resolutions			0
the reactor produces 6kgs of plutonium a year , which could be used by @entity3 to make nuclear weapons			1
' the white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online , indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation , ' said a report published on the @entity85 - based institute 's website , @entity86 , yesterday			2
@entity3 has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 - however , the @entity15 reactor , that yields weapons and bomb - grade plutonium , has been technically out of operation for years			1
in 2008 , the @entity86 destroyed its cooling tower as a confidence - building step in the six - nation talks			0
however , in april , @entity3 announced that it would revive the aged reactor , but stressed it was seeking a deterrent capacity			0
@entity3 's @entity15 nuclear complex ( pictured ) is situated about 55 miles north of @entity51			2
the country is suspected of restarting a five megawatt reactor capable of producing weapons - grade plutonium @entity51 ( pictured ) has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 - however , the @entity15 reactor has been technically out of operation for years @entity102 have agreed to reopen the @entity103 on a trial basis next week at the time , nuclear experts said it would probably take about half a year to get the reactor up and running if it had not suffered significant damage from neglect			1
however , the report , written by @entity111 and @entity112 , suggests that the reactor has been started already and may , in fact , be nearing completion			0
' acknowledging that we are not completely certain yet , this is very disappointing but not at all unexpected , ' said @entity118 , an analyst for the @entity119 at the @entity120 , a @entity85 - based think tank			0
' it 's not unexpected because we 've been able to see for months through satellite imagery that @entity3 has been working on repairing the five - megawatt electric reactor			1
' restarting it is another slap in the face to the international community , indicating that @entity3 has no intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear weapons			2
' the @entity132 nuclear watchdog has said today that it is aware of the report , but it does not yet have a ' clear understanding ' of the situation			0
this week , the @entity10 ambassador to the @entity138 , @entity139 , said the @entity138 board of governors had ' reiterated overwhelmingly ' that @entity3 must cease all nuclear activities immediately and refrain from taking any steps to restart its nuclear facilities at @entity15			2
@entity3 said in july it would not give up its nuclear deterrent until @entity85 ends its ' hostile policy ' towards @entity51 , although it was ready to revive nuclear talks			0
the country tested a nuclear weapon in february and spent the first three months of 2013 issuing bellicose threats , including a warning that it would launch a nuclear attack against the @entity10 and @entity54			0
recently , however , @entity51 has been on what analysts describe as one of its ' periodic charm offensives ' - agreeing with @entity157 on wednesday to re-open a shuttered industrial park on a trial basis			0
the @entity103 industrial zone , which lies inside @entity3 , was closed when @entity51 pulled its 53,000 workers out in april amid rising tensions			2
but now , @entity86 and @entity54 have agreed to restart operations at the joint industrial park , which will be opened on a trial basis next week			0
@entity54 's @entity166 has said it can not confirm the suspected restarting of @entity15 's nuclear reactor because it involves confidential intelligence .			2

the *yongbyon* nuclear facility in @entity3 was closed in 2007 under the terms of a disarmament agreement
its five megawatt reactor can produce plutonium for weapons and bombs
new satellite images have captured steam rising from the complex
this suggests the nuclear reactor has been restarted , according to a @entity10 research institute
