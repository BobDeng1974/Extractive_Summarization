insisting there was ' absolutely no way i 'm a racist ' , she added : ' the only people i do have problems with are negroes			1
and i do n't know why			0
' i do n't know whether there is something in my psyche or whether it 's karma from a previous life or whether something happened to me as a very , very young person and i 've drawn a veil over it - because that sometimes happens , does n't it ? ms @entity6 denies being a racist , saying the ' only people i do have problems with are negroes ' ' but i really do have a problem with people with negroid features			1

now that 's no justification at all , it does n't answer the question " why is she like that with them and not anybody else			0

' i used the word " negroes " as you would do @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			2
it 's a description , it 's not an insult - in the same way as you would say " what do you mean by @entity80 ? " well , they belong to a community , they have got a certain faith , they have usually got noses that have got a bit of a curve to them , married women - if they are orthodox jews - wear wigs			0
' she added : ' i do n't regret saying it			0
i do n't regret anything , that 's the truth			0
