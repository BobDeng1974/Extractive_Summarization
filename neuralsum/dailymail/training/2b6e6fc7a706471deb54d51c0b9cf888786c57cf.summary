by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 21:05 est , 10 january 2014 @entity3 ’s @entity2 side have been the surprise package of the 2013 - 14 campaign in @entity6			1
they are locked on 49 points with @entity9 , with only the defending champions ’ superior goal difference keeping them top of the league , while rivals @entity14 are five points adrift			1
here , @entity0 previews the big match ... video : scroll down to watch @entity19 star in @entity9 keepy up challenge will he , wo n't he ? @entity19 ( centre ) is not guaranteed to start when @entity9 meet second placed @entity2 still got it ! @entity19 made a goal scoring return as a substitute against @entity26 in the @entity27 in the dugout : @entity9 head coach @entity29 is in his first season at the @entity31 while @entity3 ( right ) has been this season 's surprise package with @entity2 @entity9 coach @entity29 is contemplating leaving @entity19 on the bench for saturday night ’s potential title decider against @entity2			1
@entity19 came on as a substitute in midweek and scored twice in 25 minutes against @entity26 in the @entity27 but 50 days without a game prior to his return has left the @entity41 manager pondering his final decision			2
@entity29 said : ' @entity19 likes to finish games so sometimes the best way to make sure he does not over do it is to have him come off the bench			1
we are always thinking about the last game , but we have to remember he was out for almost two months before that			0
' he looked good on wednesday but we will decide on saturday whether or not he starts			0
' if any team in the world can afford not to rush @entity19 back then it ’s @entity9 who have averaged a goal every four games without him			1
for the first time in their history at this stage of the sesaon @entity9 have five players on more than 10 goals			2
@entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have joined @entity19 and @entity64 in double figures and leaving the four - times @entity67 winner on the bench would still leave @entity9 with a front three to frighten any defence			1
boy from @entity71 : @entity64 ( centre ) has been in fine form since his big money summer move from @entity75 @entity76 : fabregas goal getter : @entity61 hot stuff : @entity81 @entity80 @entity2 coach @entity3 said he doubted @entity29 would leave out @entity19 despite the form of his other strikers			1
he said : ‘ it is possible because @entity9 has a wonderful squad and thanks to @entity29 they now have a lot of different and very dangerous options			2
they have survived without @entity19			0
the other day @entity61 scored a hat - trick , then @entity62 scored a hat - trick			0
but i ca n’t really imagine @entity19 not playing in this game			0
’ @entity29 ’s final doubts may turn not just on @entity19 ’s impressive return in midweek but also on his incredible record against @entity2			1
@entity2 are his favourite victim			0
he has scored 20 career goals against them – 17 coming in 14 league matches			1
in what is the most eagerly anticipated game anywhere in @entity103 this weekend those sensational @entity9 striking options will be pitted against the meanest defence in @entity105			2
@entity106 ’s on loan keeper @entity107 will once again be behind @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
' we need to defend well and hurt them on the counter attack ' said the @entity71 left - back who believes @entity2 forward @entity116 could be just as decisive as any of @entity9 ’s attackers			1
playing for keeps : @entity106 's on loan keeper @entity107 is hoping to keep @entity9 's attack at bay hitman : @entity2 's @entity116 ( left ) is @entity105 's second highest scorer with 19 goals attacking intent : @entity2 's @entity123 , believed to be a @entity125 target , will be another one to watch costa whose 19 goals have him just behind @entity129 as @entity105 ’s second highest scorer , will partner former @entity9 favourite @entity131 for a game between two sides separated only by goal difference in the table			1
@entity3 admitted : ‘ individually they are better than us but we have a very strong group			0
we feel strong and very competitive			0
’ both teams have just one defeat and one draw and @entity2 have won every home game played this season			0
what they have failed to do over the last three years is beat @entity9 in any of the six league games played between the two sides			1
it is the biggest test of their title credentials but it will also test @entity9 who for all the glorious options going forward still creak at the back especially when defending set - plays			0
@entity29 ’s team have conceded five times already in the league from corners and corner - kicks will be cheered like goals by the expected 54,000 sell - out crowd			2
bogey man : @entity19 ( right ) has scored 17 goals in 14 league games against @entity2 bench mark : @entity6 football is waiting to see if @entity19 ( centre ) plays in @entity9 's biggest game of the season it has been ten years since neither @entity14 nor @entity9 won the league			1
@entity172 ’s win under @entity173 owed more to persistence and patience than sparkling football			0
@entity2 ’s adventure has so far been a lot more exhilarating with a @entity178 and last season ’s @entity27 win over @entity14 picked up along the way			0
coach @entity3 is facing a former player in one - time @entity183 striker @entity80 as well as fellow countryman @entity29 in the opposing dug - out			0
the @entity41 keeping both awake on friday night , however , will be @entity19 – @entity29 wondering whether or not to pick him ; and @entity186 wondering how to stop him .			2
