a mother - of - five was inspired to slim down eight dress sizes after a terrifying dream in which she was left trapped in a house fire because firemen could not lift her from her burning bed			1
teaching assistant @entity6 , 40 , reached 17st 3lb and wore size 26 clothing after years of comfort eating and grazing			1
her uncomfortably large @entity11 breasts made exercise difficult			2
she said : ' my breast size had caused problems since my teenage years			1
i had awful shoulder , back and neck problems which would n’t go away			0
' i used that as an excuse not to lose weight			0
being so top - heavy i thought it would n’t make any difference if the rest of me was slim or not , so the weight piled on			1
; right : @entity6 after she shed the pounds and had a breast reduction but then a horrifying dream , in which she imagined being left to burn alive because no one was strong enough to rescue her , motivated her to finally change her lifestyle			1
the mother - of - five from @entity42 started a diet and exercise plan that saw her shrink down to the 10st 7lb , size 10 she is today			1
she said , ' i woke up with a start - the dream felt absolutely real			2
it shook me to my core			0
' it was such a disturbing and embarrassing experience that i ’ve hardly told anyone about it			0
but it was enough to get me started on losing weight for good			0
' @entity6 , who is mother to @entity57 , aged 19 , @entity58 , 15 , @entity59 , 13 , @entity60 , 10 and @entity61 , nine , with her partner of 24 years , @entity62 , 43 , put on weight because of long - standing back problems caused by her top - heavy figure			1

' at each pregnancy i convinced myself i was eating for two , and as the kids grew up i found myself habitually eating their leftovers and grazing at their snack food during the day			0
' in july 2010 , when @entity6 was at her heaviest weight , she went to bed not anticipating the shock that awaited her			1
she said : ' i dreamt i was in our flat , when the whole place burst into flames			0
a fireman appeared at the window , and tried to lift me out of the room			0
' he could n’t get a grip on me because of my size			2
then he climbed back out of the window , and left me there to die			0
@entity6 before she lost weight and dreamt she was left trapped in a house fire ' it was terrible			1
i woke up with a start but was too shaken to talk to @entity65 about it			0
' @entity6 decided to hit the gym and cut out sugary and fatty snacks , losing more than two stone , before she decided to give the @entity102 programme a try			1
the programme focused on eliminating sugar and starchy carbohydrates coupled with daily 10 - minute workouts			1
@entity6 pictured recently , having lost weight and undergone breast reduction surgery she said : ' as i started to lose weight , i decided to address my back problems			1
i went to my doctor in the summer of 2013 and asked about the possibility of breast reduction surgery			1
' he was very supportive , but a consultant at the hospital told me i needed to lost another two - and - a - half stone before i would qualify for the operation on the @entity119			2
' i was sure i would n’t be able to get there but i asked my slimming consultant for support and through dieting and exercise i managed it by february this year			2
' miss @entity6 underwent breast reduction surgery in july 2014 and has managed to maintain her slim figure by continuing on her diet programme			1
at her heaviest weight , miss @entity6 typically ate three slices of toast with peanut butter for breakfast , followed by fried egg sandwiches for lunch , and a @entity137 takeaway for her evening meal			2
she would snack on crisps and chocolate , with cups of coffee and cans of coke throughout the day			0
today , she enjoys a boiled egg with asparagus for breakfast , with chicken salad for lunch and white fish with steamed vegetables for evening meal			0
she also tends not to snack			0
she said : ' now that i ’m slimmer and do n’t suffer with back problems anymore , i feel like a completely new person			0
' i used to struggle to climb the stairs and even walking was difficult - i could only waddle			2
