@entity0 may be single , but he wo n't be spending @entity1 alone			1
the 27 - year - old @entity2 started an online campaign last month to find someone to take his ex-girlfriend 's place on a round - the - world trip they planned back in march			1
the couple 's subsequent break - up left him with multiple non-transferable tickets in his ex 's name , so he set out to find another @entity2 called @entity14 to give the tickets to for free			1
and the search was a success			0
a 23 - year - old student and part - time office administrator named @entity20 , from @entity21 , took @entity0 up on his offer , despite her long - term boyfriend 's less than enthusiastic attitude			1
@entity21 student @entity20 , 23 ( right ) , agreed to join the stranger on the trip just friends : however , the trip will be completely platonic since @entity14 already has a boyfriend , who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man			1
pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on @entity44 pick me , pick me ! @entity14 tweeted this picture of her @entity2 passport when she heard @entity0 was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from @entity50 to @entity51 ' he understands that i 've always wanted to travel so while he 's not happy i 'm taking off for nearly a month at @entity1 with a random guy he 's smiling through it , ' @entity14 said of her boyfriend , who she plans to purchase a home with			1
@entity14 says she initially thought the trip was ' crazy ' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to @entity0 over the phone			1
' it definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that i talked to him it 's less creepy and more awesome , ' she said			0
@entity0 says the trip will be ' strictly platonic ' and he 's looking forward to jetting out of @entity50 on december 21			1
the original @entity14 : @entity0 ( left ) originally planned to spend this @entity1 holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend @entity14 ( left )			1
she broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets @entity0 and @entity14 will then travel to @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity51 before returning to @entity75 on january 8			1
because @entity0 stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend , he did n't book any hotels for the trip			1
however , after the story went viral online , @entity80 stepped up to provide @entity0 and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey			2
@entity0 plans to document the once - in - a - lifetime trip with a stranger online			1
the experience also opened him up to the realization of how lucky he is to be going on such a trip			2
of the thousands of emails he received in his search , he got one especially touching message from an 8 - year - old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision			1
that message inspired @entity0 , who works in international real estate , to start an organization with his brother called @entity102 to help people who want to travel but do n't have the money			2
@entity0 initially started his search on @entity105 last month , posting a plea that said : ' i need your help			2
you see , in march i booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this @entity1 for my ex and i. desperate : in november , @entity0 posted this message to @entity105 in an attempt to find another @entity14 willing to join him on the trip ' while our relationship has come to a close , i am still planning on going on the trip and she is not ( naturally )			1
' and because i hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste , i am looking for a @entity2 named @entity14 who could use the ticket			2
' anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible			0
' moreover , the flights were purchased during a massive blow - up on @entity132 and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they 're not worth the headache or money to cancel			2
' before potential candidates started applying to accompany him , he laid some ground rules , but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off			2
giving : the campaign opened up @entity143 to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation , and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who ca n't afford it he wrote : ' i am not looking for anything in return			0
i am not looking for companionship , romance , drugs , a trade , or to take selfies with you in front the @entity159 in @entity72			0
' if you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks , great			0
really the only thing i ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness			0
' we can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not			0
i 'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing ( see ya on the plane ! )			0
' embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing , though , so if you want to travel together ( and are not an axe murder ) i â€™m likely game			0
' this is for the flights only			0
in the wake of the breakup i have deferred all further planning for the trip			0
no hotels , trains or anything have been booked			0
you 're on your own , bucko			0
having said that , i will buy the first round of vino at @entity189 upon departure			0

@entity0 booked once - in - a - lifetime @entity1 trip with girlfriend @entity14 last year , but they broke up
the 27 - year - old @entity75 *resident* started an online campaign last month to find someone also called @entity14 to take tickets in her name
a 23 - year - old student named @entity20 agreed and is set to jet off with @entity0 on december 21
however , the trip will be strictly platonic since she already has a boyfriend
