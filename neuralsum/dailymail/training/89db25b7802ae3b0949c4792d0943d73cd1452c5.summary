by @entity1 reporter published : 08:37 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 17 april 2012 though she carried two beautiful daughters and gave birth to them nine months later , @entity3 citizen @entity2 can not call her daughters @entity3			1
that ’s because ms @entity2 , a single mother , turned to in vitro fertilisation to become pregnant while in @entity10 , giving birth to her girls there			2
when she tried to obtain citizenship for her twins at the @entity3 consulate in @entity17 , she was denied because she could not prove the egg and sperm used to conceive her children were from those of @entity3 citizens			1
even more humiliating , she said , was that the consulate worker asked her through a loudspeaker in a room teeming with people how she conceived the twins			0
ms @entity2 , who is from @entity44 , told the today that she was offended by the question , which she considered an invasion of privacy			1
‘ i was embarrassed , humiliated , horrified , ashamed , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s an outrageous question.in an interesting loophole , children adopted from other countries are eligible to become @entity3 citizens			2
the issue lies in a law that says , according to the @entity54 , that a child must have a biological link with at least one parent			0
@entity58 : @entity32 and @entity33 can not become @entity3 citizens unless their mother moves them back to the @entity3 and they live there six months - but their home is in @entity17 humiliation : ms @entity2 said she was angered and embarrassed when a staffer at the @entity25 asked her how her daughters were conceived because her twins @entity65 and @entity33 were conceived via in vitro fertilisation , there was no such link between ms @entity2 and her daughters			1
most fertility clinics do not keep records from donors , and are anonymous , thus making it impossible for ms @entity2 to prove the nationality of her daughters ’ biological parents			1
however , ms @entity2 carried the twins to term and delivered them , and her name is on their birth certificates – she , of course , is listed as their mother			0
ms @entity2 told today : ‘ @entity3 policy is not keeping up with the technology			2
that ’s essentially what the issue is			0
’ according to @entity86 , an @entity10 - based attorney who focuses on @entity3 immigration law , calls the probing questions ‘ profiling , ’ saying that the embassies only ask single , older women where their children came from			2
in vitro , veritas : because ms @entity2 does n't know the nationality of the sperm and egg donors , the @entity3 @entity25 denied her twins citizenship ; she said the law is lagging behind modern technology ( file photo ) as @entity38 notes , around 200,000 @entity3 citizens living in @entity10 have dual citizenship – which allows them to receive ivf treatments for free			1
@entity32 and @entity33 could become @entity3 citizens if they lived in the @entity107 for at least six months and completed other necessary steps			1
however , as today notes , the family is situated in @entity17			0
for the moment , ms @entity2 has given up the uphill citizenship battle			0
‘ if i ’d gone back to the @entity107 to give birth , my children would have automatically received @entity3 citizenship			1

@entity44 native @entity2 received ivf treatment in @entity17 and gave birth to twin daughters in 2009
