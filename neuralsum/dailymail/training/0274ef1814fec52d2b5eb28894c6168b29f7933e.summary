with around third of @entity2 admitting to believing in aliens , and more exoplanets being discovered that could harbour life , it is no longer unusual to believe in the existence of @entity8 now an astronomer has claimed that a person 's belief in extraterrestrial life varies according to whether they also believe in a @entity14 and even specifically which religion they identify with			1
in the new book he reveals that atheists are the most likely group of people to believe in extra-terrestrials , at 55 per cent , followed by @entity22			1
astronomy professor @entity25 , of @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ‘ when i did a library search , i found only half a dozen books and they were all written about the question of extraterrestrial life and @entity47 , and mostly about @entity36 , so i decided to take a broader look			1
’ ‘ very few among us have spent much time thinking hard about what actual knowledge about extraterrestrial life , whether viruses or single - celled creatures or bipeds piloting intergalactic spaceships , might mean for our personal beliefs [ and ] our relationships with the divine			2
’ his book , @entity62 and @entity8 , includes the results of a poll that found 55 per cent of atheists believe aliens exist , while 44 per cent of @entity22 and 37 per cent of @entity28 think that life is out there in the universe			1
around 36 per cent of @entity70 and 32 per cent of @entity71 believe in aliens as well as divine beings			1
of the @entity71 , the @entity74 faithful were the most likely to believe in aliens ( 41 per cent ) while @entity77 were the most sceptical at 29 per cent			0
catholic leaders have been debating about the possibility of life on other worlds for a thousand years.the crux of the debate is whether intelligent aliens would suffer from original sin , because they are not descended from @entity86 ( illustrated ) and if they do , did @entity87 visit them and was he resurrected on other planets ? professor @entity25 thinks that @entity90 religions would have the least difficulty in accepting the discovery of extraterrestrial life , because @entity38 thinkers have speculated that humans may be reincarnated as aliens , and vice versa , while @entity99 cosmology includes thousands of inhabited worlds			1
he found passages in the @entity102 that appear to support the idea that spiritual beings exist on other planets , but notes that these beings may not practice @entity107 as it is practiced on @entity108			0
however , professor @entity25 found very little in @entity35 scriptures or rabbinical writings hinting at the existence of aliens			2
the few @entity114 and @entity115 commentaries on the subject do assert that space is infinite and contains a potentially infinite number of worlds and that nothing can deny the existence of extraterrestrial life			0
he says that @entity28 do n’t believe the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have much effect on them , quoting a @entity28 anthropologist and scholar who concluded that the relationship between @entity28 and @entity14 would not be affected in the slightest by ‘ the existence of other life forms , newly discovered scientific realities or pan-human behavioural changes			2
’ if the rate of discovery keeps up its current pace , astronomers will have identified more than a million exoplanets by the year 2045 and some of them may harbour alien life ( a ' traditional ' representation of an alien is pictured ) leading more religious leaders to question the impact extraterrestrials may have on their beliefs professor @entity25 said that @entity145 have given the possibility of extraterrestrial life the most thought among @entity47 religions			1
catholic leaders have been having an on - off debate about the possibility of life on other worlds for a thousand years , he said			0
the crux of the debate is whether intelligent aliens would suffer from original sin , because they are not descended from @entity86 , and if they do , did @entity87 visit them and was he resurrected on other planets ? ‘ from a @entity145 perspective , if sentient extraterrestrials exist some but perhaps not all such species may suffer original sin and will require redemption , ’ according to professor @entity25			2
the debate may increasingly come to the fore , because astronomers are detecting exoplanets - some of which could harbour life - at a rate faster than ever before			0
in 2000 , astronomers had detected 50 planets orbiting other stars , while today that number has grown to more than 1,000			0
professor @entity25 believes @entity90 religions would have the least difficulty in accepting the discovery of extraterrestrial life , because @entity38 thinkers have speculated that humans may be reincarnated as aliens , while @entity99 cosmology includes thousands of inhabited worlds			1
a praying @entity99 monk is pictured if the rate of discovery keeps up its current pace , astronomers will have identified more than a million exoplanets by the year 2045			0
while there are many conflicting views in the @entity192 faith , he said that @entity195 theologian @entity194 ’s view are probably largely representative – that the ‘ saving power ’ of @entity14 must be everywhere			0
however , @entity14 ’s plan for human life may not be the same as his plan for aliens			0
professor @entity25 thinks that @entity202 and fundamental @entity71 may struggle the most to accept any discovery of alien life , because most of their leaders assert that extraterrestrial life does not exist			1
however , @entity207 and seventh - day @entity208 are two @entity47 faiths that embrace aliens			2
in @entity207 , @entity14 helps exalt lesser souls so they can achieve immortality and live as gods on other worlds .			0

astronomer @entity25 at @entity40 in @entity42 has written a book *discussing* which faiths are likely to embrace aliens
a study in it reveals that 55 per cent of atheists believe aliens exist , while 44 per cent of @entity22 and 37 per cent of @entity28 think that life is out there
around 32 per cent of @entity71 believe in aliens as well as divine beings
professor @entity25 thinks that @entity90 religions would have the least difficulty in accepting the discovery of extraterrestrial life
