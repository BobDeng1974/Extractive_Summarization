by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor foreign companies will be hit with huge fines if they break promises to protect @entity6 jobs			1
@entity7 said assurances made during takeover talks must be honoured , or companies would face the consequences			2
the business secretary said he wanted to tighten the law so there is ‘ no wiggle - room ’ to hold businesses to account			1
business secretary @entity7 said he wanted to tighten the law so there is ‘ no wiggle - room ’ to hold businesses to account the move follows controversy over the ultimately failed takeover bid by @entity25 pharmaceuticals giant @entity24 for @entity6 - based @entity26			1
while the takeover looked like it might still happen , the government insisted it was working to protect jobs and investment in research in the @entity6			0
but critics said that once a company takes control of a @entity6 firm , there is little that can be done to ensure they stick to their promises			0
now tougher laws are being looked at to bolster the ' national interest test ' following concerns about the acquisition of major @entity6 firms			1
pledges made during negotiations should be legally binding with penalties for breaking them running into millions of pounds , mr @entity7 said			2
he told @entity49 ’s @entity48 show : ‘ ' we ’re probably going to get other big takeovers coming down the track			0
‘ i think where we now have to strengthen that is to make sure that any commitments made , there ’s no wiggle - room			0
‘ and we ’re talking to the @entity57 about how to do that and we may well get into the area of having financial penalties in order to make sure that those commitments are binding			2
’ he said new laws were in the pipeline , and suggested the @entity65 could go further and demanded a tougher public interest test introduced on foreign takeovers			1
mr @entity7 added : ‘ supposing the company do n’t want to negotiate , or they ’re not willing to give the assurances you need , what do you do then ? ‘ and i think you then need some fallback powers , you need the last resort where the government can intervene , can invoke the public interest under the existing legislation			1
‘ what i would argue – and the @entity65 ’ view within the @entity80 – is we need to do this , as it were , with a laser missile rather than a cluster bomb ... ' we are going to need a last resort power such that if there is something that is very clearly against the national interest – and the loss of our r&d in pharmaceuticals is a very good example – the government can in those circumstances intervene			2
i made it very clear when the original takeover was taking place that we were reserving all our options			0
' the move follows controversy over the ultimately failed takeover bid by @entity25 pharmaceuticals giant @entity24 for @entity6 - based @entity26 ( pictured ) at the time of @entity26 deal , @entity104 called for the government to strengthen the public interest test for takeovers so any potential buyout would be subject to an assessment of how it impacted on @entity6 's strategic research and science base			1
today shadow business secretary @entity115 said : ‘ @entity104 has led calls for a strengthened public interest test to apply to proposed takeovers and mergers in order to protect @entity6 ’s r&d and science base , which the business secretary - three months on - now appears to be coming round to			1
' @entity7 says he wants commitments given by the bidders of target @entity6 companies to have more teeth , a move which @entity104 would welcome			2
my offer to work with @entity7 to achieve these aims , on a cross-party basis , remains open			0
' @entity134 general secretary @entity133 welcomed the move , which she said was evidence of the government tackling living standards rather than ' union - bashing '			0
she told @entity49 's @entity140 : ' i think it 's definitely a step in the right direction			0
' this is the kind of thing that the government should be concentrating on - how do we make sure that we get real investment for the future and we start tackling living standards instead of having a bit of old - fashioned union bashing			0

@entity7 says he wants ' no *wriggleroom* ' when promises are made
