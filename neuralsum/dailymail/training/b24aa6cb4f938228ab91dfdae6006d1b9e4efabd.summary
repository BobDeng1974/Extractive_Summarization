a farmer ’s £ 2million home was sold to his brother for a fraction of its value after a solicitor forged his signature on land deeds , his family claimed last night			1
the solicitor confessed to police that he had faked the signature of @entity12 on the sale of his 485 - acre farm and was charged with fraud			1
but days before the lawyer was due to appear in court he was found drowned and the criminal case was dropped as a consequence			2
however , it has led to a bitter feud between the children of farmer @entity12 , who died in november 2009 , and their uncle @entity23 , who with his wife @entity24 bought the farm near @entity26 , @entity27 , shortly before his brother ’s death			1
the home of @entity12 ( left ) , who was said to have mental health problems , was sold after solicitor @entity33 ( right ) allegedly faked his signature			1
a legal battle is looming after both men since died @entity12 ’s daughter @entity37 said her father was mentally ill and an alcoholic and so had no idea of the actions of his older brother in the sale of the farm			1
‘ he was a very poorly man , it ’s horrendous and quite unbelievable , ’ said mrs @entity37 , 34 , who claims the farm has since been valued at £ 2million			2
referring to the solicitor who allegedly forged her father ’s signature , @entity33 ( no relation ) , she added : ‘ we have a transcript of @entity33 ’s police confession and we know my father ’s signature was definitely forged , but his brother refuses to acknowledge it was illegal			1
if it was legitimate , why was my father ’s signature forged ? ‘ nieces and nephews have been done out of their inheritance but my uncle wo n’t enter into any dialogue with us about it , so now we are waiting to hear from the @entity64 as to whether we can get it back			0
it is not about the money , it is about getting justice for my father and getting back what was rightfully his			0
’ mrs @entity37 said she and her siblings @entity75 , 36 , @entity76 , 30 , and step - brothers @entity72 , 30 , and @entity73 , 19 , realised there were problems with their father ’s affairs after his death from liver problems aged 52 in 2009			2
they began looking into the sale of his farm , where he was born and raised , and employed forensic handwriting experts who proved the signature on @entity64 deeds , transferring the ownership of the farm to his brother in april 2009 , were fake , before alerting police			1
the family of ' vulnerable ' man who died after his north @entity97 farm ( pictured ) was sold following an alleged fraud by a solicitor , later found dead , face a potential legal battle to have the sale overturned it is understood @entity23 and his wife were questioned but never formally arrested and denied any wrongdoing			1
they refused to comment when contacted by the @entity106			0
even though the solicitor ’s confession was handed to the @entity64 in february , it has so far refused to overturn the sale			1
mrs @entity37 said that if the sale was declared invalid , the money could be returned to her father ’s estate and her uncle would then be entitled to claim compensation from the @entity64 , but ten months later they are still awaiting a decision			0
accountant @entity119 , 54 , @entity12 ’s first wife and mrs @entity37 ’s mother , said : ‘ @entity121 have done everything they can to dodge our application and have been reluctant to admit they made a mistake			2
‘ @entity33 was in a position of trust and he totally abused that			2
we ’ve got such indisputable evidence			0
you ca n’t get much better evidence than a confession , but still nothing has been done			0
’ the body of solicitor @entity33 was found on @entity137 after he allegedly admitted fraud to police at an inquest into @entity33 ’s death in july the coroner recorded an open verdict , saying he could not be certain the ‘ devoted ’ father of three had committed suicide			1
mr @entity12 , a former deputy high sheriff of @entity146 , had left for work as usual , asking his wife what was for supper , before his car was later found abandoned near a railway bridge			1
his body was found washed up near @entity153 , 15 miles away			0
at the time of his death his family said in a statement : ‘ as far as the family is concerned , @entity33 is innocent and not guilty of any offence			1
no court has found him guilty of any crime			0
this is an allegation of fraud and has not been proven			0
’ they were also asked to comment on the alleged confession but did not respond			0
a spokesman for @entity167 said : ‘ we can confirm that no one else has been arrested in connection with this case			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity64 said : ‘ we are in contact with the solicitors representing mr @entity12 ’s children about their application regarding their clients ’ claim to the property			2
this process has not been completed and we will continue to work with all parties to resolve the situation			0

@entity33 worked on sale of house owned by late @entity12
family say the property was sold for a fraction of its actual value
it is claimed the solicitor admitted the fraud to police before his death
he was then found dead on a beach in north @entity97 before fraud trial
family of *seller* are now considering legal action to overturn farm *'s* sale
relatives of the solicitor have *previously* *insisted* he is innocent
