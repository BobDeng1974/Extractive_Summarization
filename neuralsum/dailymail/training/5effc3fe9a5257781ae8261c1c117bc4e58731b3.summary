@entity1 ' ' outraged ' daughter will sue throat specialist to the stars dr @entity4 , friends have revealed			1
@entity6 is preparing to launch legal action against @entity8 , which was blasted yesterday in a damning report by the @entity11 @entity10			1
and she will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother 's personal @entity15 doctor as well			1
a source told @entity18 today : ' @entity6 is undaunted , she 's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved			2
these doctors will rue the day they went near @entity1			2
' the @entity23 report revealed a catalog of errors at the clinic where the legendary comic suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure that led to her death			0
both are believed to have been treating @entity1 when she went into cardiac arrest during a routine endoscopy on august 28 among the series of blunders , it was reported that staff at the @entity49 clinic failed to weigh @entity1 before sedating her with @entity50 - the anesthetic that killed @entity52			1
the clinic also comes under fire for allowing a doctor without privileges , known to be dr @entity4 , to practice at the medical center			1
indeed , dr @entity4 is said to have declared ' i 'll go first ' as she stepped into the operating room with dr @entity40 , the report says			1
it also confirms a picture was taken of the star while she was under anesthesia , alongside dr @entity4			1
heartbroken @entity6 , 46 , will file a multimillion - dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against @entity71 and is working with top firm @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 & @entity78			1
in a statement , attorneys @entity77 and @entity78 said : ' our client , @entity6 , is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the @entity88 report			2
' as any of us would be , ms. @entity1 is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before , during and after the procedure			2
moving forward , ms. @entity1 will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient			0
' meanwhile , the friend said that although grief - stricken , @entity6 wants to continue to produce her mother 's e ! show fashion police in memory of @entity1			1
the network is looking to replace the venerable @entity1 , although the star 's close friend @entity101 , who has been linked with the spot , told people : ' they did offer it to me			1
i do n't know if the situation is correct or right at this time for me			0
' @entity110 ’ official cause of death is “ anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation			0
” the firm needs to obtain @entity1 's medical records before filing a case in @entity119 and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge			2
on monday , the @entity23 reported that the legendary comic was in excellent health before undergoing what was supposed to be a routine endoscopy			0
while the doctors who treated @entity1 are not mentioned by name , they are believed to be her personal throat specialist dr @entity4 and @entity71 medical director dr @entity40			1
and most worryingly , both dr @entity4 and dr @entity40 failed to notice that @entity1 's vital signs were going down , as the report claims they failed to provide ' timely intervention '			1
according to the findings , @entity1 , 81 , arrived at @entity71 on the morning of august 28 for tests after suffering chronic reflux			1
she was in good health and her blood pressure was a normal 118 over 80 when her vital signs were first taken at 8.44am			0
her pulse was 62 and regular			0
the star was set to undergo an @entity143 ( @entity143 ) , where doctors insert a thin scope and camera into the area between the throat and upper intestine			0
however , even though @entity1 had only agreed to only the one procedure , the report states she underwent a @entity152 performed by her personal @entity15 doctor @entity4 - who was not authorized to practice at the clinic			1
this was stopped when dr @entity156 said she did not have a clear view			0
the @entity143 then went ahead , carried out by @entity158 , and dr @entity4 performed a second @entity152			2
worryingly , a staff member told the @entity23 investigators that @entity1 was not weighed before @entity50 was administered			0
this is ' critical ' according to the report			0
the records note an ' inconsistent ' log of the @entity50 dosage			0
although it says she was given a total of 300 milligrams , the clinic 's anestiologist said this was a mistake and only 120 milligrams was administered			0
@entity50 hit the headlines after the death of superstar @entity52 in 2009 , when it was revealed he had overdosed on the powerful sedative			0
bffs : distraught @entity6 posted a picture of her son @entity178 and her mother @entity1 , writing : ' @entity180 , 2004			2
mom + @entity178 = bffs ... a perfect day			0
@entity182 ' still working : dr @entity4 is still working at her @entity49 office			1
she charges $ 460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance			0
she is believed to have been in the room at @entity8 when @entity1 went into cardiac arrest on august 28 perhaps the most damning criticism of the clinic comes as the report says ' the physicians in charge of @entity1 failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention during the procedure '			1
indeed , by 9.30am , @entity1 's blood pressure had plunged to 85 over 49 and no pulse was recorded			2
the report , released after interviews with @entity71 staff and others , says there is conflicting information as to the time that @entity1 was resuscitated and transferred to @entity205			1
last month , it was revealed that @entity1 's daughter @entity6 has signed up a @entity49 legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion - dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma			1
today , dr @entity4 's lawyer , @entity213 , declined to comment			2
dr @entity4 is known as the throat specialist to the stars and counts @entity217 and @entity218 as well as a host of @entity221 stars among her patients			2
previously , mr @entity213 told @entity18 : ' @entity224 , @entity223 is a highly experienced , board certified otolaryngologist			0
she maintains privileges at one of the city 's most prestigious hospitals			0
she is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients			0
famous clientele : dr @entity4 , who is believed to have been in the room when @entity1 underwent her ill - fated procedure , counts @entity217 as one of her patients			1
in the singer 's 2010 documentary , dr @entity4 performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords ' as a matter of personal and professional policy , dr. @entity4 does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment			1
further , dr. @entity4 is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient			0
' for these reasons , neither dr. @entity4 nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice			0
we ask that the press please respect dr. @entity4 's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients , as well as the privacy of her patients			2
