by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 07:24 est , 6 october 2012 hit with the ladies : one in five @entity3 women would like to marry president @entity4 as president @entity4 prepares to turn 60 years old , it appears he is still a hit with the ladies as a new survey reveals one in five @entity3 women would like to marry him			1
the active president , who is often pictured horse riding topless , hand - gliding and driving @entity13 race cars , turns 60 tomorrow			0
but that does n't seem to have had any impact on his charm - with six per cent of @entity3 women saying they ' definitely would ' marry @entity4 while a further 14 per cent said they probably would			1
just 43 per cent said they ' definitely would not ' want to walk down the aisle the president , who has ruled the country for 12 years , in the survey by the independent polling station @entity27			1
but while the president may still appeal to a high percentage of the female population , it appears that he is n't as popular with the remaining electorate			0
@entity4 has been facing growing pressure as protests continue against @entity3 's rigid political system and repressive @entity37 laws that have provoked wide - spread discontent			1
utilities fees and other municipal payments rose during the summer and look set to continue to rise throughout the winter			0
analysts warn that the government would quickly run out of cash to pay wages and pensions if @entity3 ’s energy revenues dry up			2
even with the current relatively high oil prices , the @entity37 has been struggling to raise funds for a planned pension reform			0
@entity4 has pledged repeatedly to ease @entity3 ’s dependence on energy exports , encourage high - tech industries , create incentives for small and medium business and improve the investment climate			1
but oil and gas revenues still account for the bulk of the government budget , while red tape , rampant corruption and courts bowing to official orders have spooked investors and stymied economic development			0
@entity68 , a political consultant with past ties to the @entity37 , said : ' @entity4 has n’t moved a finger to change the economic model established during his 12 - year rule , and he ca n’t be realistically expected to make any changes now			2
but even @entity90 officials have acknowledged that his promises ca n’t be fulfilled without destabilizing the economy - meaning he could face trouble whichever way he turns			0
after his inauguration , @entity4 cracked down on his foes with a slew of draconian laws that hiked fines 150-fold for taking part in unauthorized protests , decriminalized slander and required non-government organizations that receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents			2
taking down the opposition : @entity4 during a judo training session at @entity108 in @entity109 soft side : @entity4 feeds a @entity112 whale named @entity113 as he visits @entity115 island , 440 miles northeast of the city of @entity117 @entity4 has suffered a gradual decline in popularity but he still enjoys majority support largely thanks to the absence of a strong alternative after years of @entity37 efforts to sideline the opposition			2
but for now he seems safe in his position and his adoring supporters will come out in their masses to celebrate his birthday tomorrow in cities from @entity80 to @entity130 in southern @entity3 , where the ruling party 's loyal @entity131 will unfurl a banner on a bridge which they say symbolises @entity4 's role by uniting @entity137 and @entity138			1
opponents will make their feelings known much closer to home , protesting near @entity143 's @entity142 under the banner : ' we 're sending the old man into retirement '			0
need for speed : @entity4 driving a @entity149 @entity13 car on a special racing track in the @entity151 outside @entity109 multitasking : @entity4 in the cockpit of @entity156 strategic bomber jet at a military airport , outside @entity143 , before his supersonic flight in the cruise - missile carrying bomber jet the organisers plan to send their own symbolic message by asking protesters to bring gifts suitable for a pensioner - anything , perhaps , from reading glasses to a pipe			2
the man himself will be relaxing with his close family and plans no special celebrations , @entity37 spokesman @entity166 said			0
just a few months into a third term as president , he may be reaching retirement age , but has no plans to retire			0
after 12 years as @entity3 's paramount leader , opinion polls show @entity4 enjoys higher ratings than most @entity178 politicians , but they are down from their peak during the oil - fuelled economic boom of his first presidency from 2000 until 2008			1
versatile : @entity4 plays the piano at a charity concert for children suffering from eye diseases and cancer in @entity109 free as a bird : @entity4 flying in a motorized deltaplane , with cranes seen in the background , in @entity193 district video : would you marry @entity4 ? one in five women say they would !			1
