at the height of the war in @entity4 , the @entity1 military required a prison camp to detain suspected jihadis not deemed dangerous enough to warrant being sent to @entity7			1

@entity11 , in southern @entity4 was home to more than 22,000 prisoners at its peak in 2007			2
it was where nine of the leading members of what would become @entity20 would meet			2
during these years , the camp provided the leaders of the embryonic @entity20 , the chance to form alliances with members of @entity41 's ousted regime			1
the camp was divided along sectarian grounds and militants enforced their own sharia law , indoctrinating many of those who would later join @entity20			2
among those held in @entity11 was @entity47 , the current leader of @entity20			1
he was held in the camp ' for several years ' before his release in 2009			1
now , the @entity1 @entity50 has sanctioned a $ 10 million bounty for information leading to the successful capture of @entity54			1
according to the @entity50 : ' @entity55 , also known as @entity47 , is the senior leader of the terrorist organisation , the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
' reflecting its greater regional ambitions , @entity57 in @entity4 changed its name in 2013 to @entity20 and stepped up its attacks across @entity61 and @entity4			2
' @entity20 attacks are calculated , coordinated , and part of a strategic campaign			0
@entity55 is in charge of overseeing all operations and is currently based in @entity61			0
the @entity1 @entity50 has a $ 10 million reward out on @entity54 despite releasing him in 2009 @entity11 , left , was opened in 2003 and was eventually closed in december 2009 when the final detainees were released including the current head of @entity20 , @entity47 , right , who was held for five years the @entity1 @entity50 has offered $ 10 million for the capture of @entity47 , pictured ' @entity55 has taken personal credit for a series of terrorist attacks in @entity4 since 2011 and claimed credit for the june 2013 operations against the @entity79 prison outside @entity80 , the march 2013 suicide bombing assault on the @entity82 , among other attacks against @entity84 and @entity4 citizens going about their daily lives			1
' @entity55 is a @entity87 under @entity88			0
he is also listed at the @entity91 @entity90 1267/1989 @entity92			0
' in june , @entity47 said he wanted to create a ' caliph for the @entity94 everywhere , ' essentially claiming the entire world for @entity20			1
@entity97 's deputy @entity96 was also held in @entity11 along with @entity98 , who is responsible for the terror organisation 's growing band of foreign fighters			1
the @entity1 military used the camp to detain suspected fighters but not worth sending to @entity7 @entity20 recruited thousands of fighters while under the guard of the @entity1 military in @entity11 , southern @entity4 terrorism researchers believe that @entity20 leaders used their time inside to make contacts with fellow fighters terrorism researchers the @entity113 , estimates that nine of @entity20 's top leaders all spent time interned at @entity11 , where they were able to establish contacts and organise the future insurgency			1
in an editorial in the @entity121 last month , @entity118 and @entity119 claimed the @entity1 made significant mistakes in the way it used @entity11			1
he said : ' before their detention , @entity54 and others were violent radicals , intent on attacking @entity1			2
their time in prison deepened their extremism and gave them opportunities to broaden their following			0
' at @entity11 , for example , the most radical figures were held alongside less threatening individuals , some of whom were not guilty of any violent crime			2
coalition prisons became recruitment centres and training grounds for the terrorists the @entity1 is now fighting			0
' @entity118 and @entity144 added : ' at @entity11 , the extremists forced moderate detainees to listen to clerics who advocated jihad			0
the majority of prisoners were illiterate , so they were particularly susceptible			0
prisoners frequently refused medical attention and vocational training for fear of breaking religious rules			0
the prisons became virtual terrorist universities : the hardened radicals were the professors , the other detainees were the students , and the prison authorities played the role of absent custodian			0
' when @entity11 closed in december 2009 , @entity1 officials were unaware of the danger posed by the likes of @entity54 and his fellow @entity20 leaders , leading to many of today 's problems			1
@entity170 , prisoners where allowed to hold discussions on @entity173 with each other , which have now been blamed on allowing illiterate detainees to be radicalised			0
after it was closed , the camp was used as a secure hotel for foreign businessmen looking to invest in @entity4 , where they were charged $ 200 - a - night			0
after its closure in 2010 , @entity11 was turned into a hotel for foreign businessmen at a rate of $ 200 a night			2

@entity20 leader @entity47 spent five years in custody in @entity11

more than 100,000 fighters were held in the camp between 2003 and 2009
