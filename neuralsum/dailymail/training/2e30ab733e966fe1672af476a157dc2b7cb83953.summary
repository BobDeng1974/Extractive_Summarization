by @entity1 reporter published : 10:59 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 16 april 2012 the @entity2 yesterday passed a resolution at its annual conference in @entity5 seeking fresh walkouts as early as this summer amid concerns over changes to public - sector pensions			1
it came just hours after the @entity11 conference in @entity12 agreed to escalate its industrial action campaign – raising the possibility of strikes in the autumn term			1
one day strike in march : teachers and lecturers marched through @entity20 to protest against staff and pension cuts just over a week ago school 's out : teachers protested in 2002 in @entity20 after government plans for changes to the @entity20 allowances @entity11 treasurer @entity28 said there had been an ‘ unprecedented , vicious , prejudiced and totally unjustified attack on the public sector ’			1
he added : ‘ as teachers we are supreme professionals and we must be treated as such			2
’ a @entity35 spokesman said : ‘ it is absurd to say our school reforms are a “ vicious assault ” on the teaching profession			0
we are putting power back into the hands of talented heads and teachers			2
’ the @entity11 is likely to need a fresh ballot of members to carry out strike action			0
the @entity2 balloted its members last spring			1
pupils and working parents face added disruption later in the year from further industrial action aimed at derailing plans to scrap national pay rates and step up performance - related pay for teachers			1
it is unclear exactly when industrial action will begin - although it could be as early as next term			2
the @entity11 resolution says : ' conference is committed to further extending the current national action instructions to restore teachers ' professionalism by attacking policies and practices which deprofessionalise teachers , including punitive fallout from the inspection and accountability regimes			2
' @entity2 general secretary @entity70 : ' our dispute is with the secretary of state ' speaking ahead of the debate , @entity11 general secretary @entity74 said : ' the @entity11 has been in continuous action short of strike since december 2011 in an attempt to get the government to focus on the real concerns of the profession and realise the effect their attacks are having , not just on teachers and their ability to do their job , but also on children and young people			1
' she added : ' teachers do not feel there is any area of their working lives the government has not trampled over and it is impairing their ability to focus on raising standards for pupils			2
' if the government commits to engaging constructively with the @entity11 there should be no need to move to further industrial action but we have reached a point where we feel we have no choice but to take steps to defend teacher professionalism from these attacks			0
' the @entity11 was the first teaching union to pass a resolution calling for further industrial action over government reforms			0
then the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) , which met for its annual conference in @entity5 yesterday , discussed a priority motion on government changes to public sector pensions			1
the motion , heard in private , could pave the way for fresh walkouts as early as this summer			0
it instructs the executive to ' seek to build a coalition of unions committed to further strike action in the summer term and beyond to defeat the government 's proposals '			1
and it calls for a discussion with those unions about ' all possible forms of joint strike and non-strike action , including national , regional and selective strike action , and campaigning activities such as joint national and local demonstrations and public meetings '			0
more strikes in 2008 : protesters march along @entity138 in a one - day strike over pay head teachers are letting bright children get away with bad behaviour because they fear that excluding them will affect their schools ’ position in league tables , it has emerged			1
last year , teaching union @entity11 launched 12 ballots in schools over ‘ poor management ’ which had an ‘ adverse effect ’ on teaching and led to ‘ general poor behaviour ’ in classes			0
reasons for the ballots included bright pupils not being excluded because ‘ the school needs their results so ca n’t afford to let them be out ’			0
@entity11 general secretary @entity74 said : ‘ what you will often get with brighter pupils is ... they will make comments to teachers like , “ my mother will complain and you will lose your job ”			1
the brighter pupils will often engage in far more back chatting with the teacher			0
’ the @entity2 , along with a number of other trade unions , has been embroiled in a row with the government over public sector pensions for more than a year			1
it took part in a walkout over pensions on june 30 last year , as well as joining the @entity178 's national day of action on november 30			0
@entity2 members in @entity20 also staged a one - day walkout last month			1
earlier this year the @entity2 , along with some other teaching unions including the @entity183 , declined to accept the government 's latest pensions offer			2
renewed action over the summer term would coincide with the main exams period , when teenagers across the country take qualifications such as gcses and a-levels			1
the @entity2 insisted that it was not the union 's intention to disrupt exams season			1
' our dispute is with the secretary of state , and ultimately , with the rest of the government in terms of public sector pensions , ' @entity2 general secretary @entity70 said			2
' we will obviously , when we discuss with other unions , discuss what timing makes sense and which regions make sense , but we would not be setting out , deliberately , to undermine the exams season			0
' the @entity210 is the only one of the big three teaching unions to accept the government ’s proposals			0
@entity2 figures suggest that a teacher with ten years of experience , working in inner @entity20 , will lose an extra £ 49 a month from april , rising to £ 123 a month by april 2014			1
a teacher with the same experience outside @entity20 will lose £ 30 a month from this april , rising to £ 74 a month from april 2014			1
this weekend ’s conference debated further strike calls over pay , workload and @entity224 plans to increase spot checks of teachers to improve their performance			2
a @entity35 spokesman said the teachers ' pensions deal is ' as good as it gets '			0
' it guarantees teachers one of the best pensions available but keeps a lid on rising costs for the taxpayer , ' he said			0
' we 've been in serious talks for months with unions to address their concerns and reach a final settlement			0
reforms to public sector pensions are essential - the status quo is not an option			0

teachers consider summer term strikes over pay cuts which ' will see them lose £ 30 a month '
@entity2 union pledges to avoid disrupting exam period
