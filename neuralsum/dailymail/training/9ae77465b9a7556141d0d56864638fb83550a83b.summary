the @entity1 licence fee could be cut after the @entity2 warned that it was a big expense for families and that ‘ nothing should be ruled out ’ when it is reviewed next year			1
in the clearest signal yet that the @entity8 are preparing to overhaul the @entity10 ’s funding and governance if they remain in government after the general election , @entity6 said the annual £ 145.50 payment would be scrutinised			1
mr @entity6 also said the @entity15 , which sets out its scope and remit and will be renewed for another decade in 2016 , must take into account big technological changes in how people watch programmes			1
culture secretary @entity6 said the £ 145.50 licence fee was a ' large amount ' of money for ordinary families the former economic secretary to the treasury was speaking to @entity28 ’s @entity27 yesterday in his first big interview since being appointed in april			1
the ex-banker was a surprise replacement for @entity32 , who stood down amid a scandal about her expenses			0
asked about the future of the licence fee , which raises £ 3.6billion a year for the @entity1 , he said : ‘ that ’s a very important issue			1
' one thing we did when we came into government was to freeze the fee at £ 145.50			1
i still think that ’s a large amount for many families up and down the country			1
this needs to be looked at when we have the @entity15 review process			0
’ @entity49 are considering scrapping the licence fee and replacing it with a subscription system or a household levy similar to council tax			2
@entity54 , chairman of the @entity55 , warned last month that the fee was ‘ designed for a different age ’ and ‘ will not survive ’			1
mr @entity6 said he would look at the alternatives after the election and when a new @entity1 chairman is appointed to replace @entity61 , who quit last month after heart surgery			2
he said : ‘ since the last charter review technology has changed			0
think of the number of people who consume programmes through platforms like @entity68 or @entity69 or even the @entity1 ’s own iplayer			2
lord @entity71 , the @entity1 's director general , could face a significantly smaller budget if the government slashes to licence fee in 2016 ‘ that ’s been a big technological change			1
when we have the review it needs to take all this into account ... nothing should be ruled out and nothing should be ruled in			0
’ the mp for @entity85 , who has taken criticism from some figures in the arts who say he lacks knowledge of the subject , also said he had always enjoyed the theatre and the last play he saw was ‘ @entity95 ’ with his daughter			2
his comments come after @entity54 , the chairman of the influential @entity55 warned last month that the licence was ‘ designed for a different age ’ and ‘ will not survive ’			2
mr @entity54 told the @entity100 it would either be dropped at the next renewal of the @entity15 in 2016 , or if no alternative is agreed on , it may be kept for the start of the next ten - year charter period			1
alternatives being considered by his cross-party committee of @entity49 , which will make recommendations to mr @entity6 , are a ‘ tv tax ’ for every home , perhaps added to council tax or another utility bill ; or a subscription service whereby people who want to watch television have to purchase a pay - tv box			2
he said last month : ‘ it ’s outmoded and was designed for a different age			0
we have a situation where if you watch live tv online you have to pay the licence fee and if you watch it on a five minute delay you do n’t			0
even if someone watches live tv online and does n’t pay its very difficult to detect			0
it ’s also regressive and there ’s no help for people who ca n’t pay			0
changes : on - demand service @entity70 does not require users to have a licence unless shows are watched live ‘ support for it is weakening by the day			1
the original settlement was that everybody gets something from the @entity1 so everybody pays it			0
but the explosion of choice in terms of channel and different ways to access it			0
’ @entity147 ’s culture spokesperson @entity146 has also conceded alternatives need to be looked at			0
there is understood to be no appetite among @entity49 for introducing adverts to fund the @entity1			0
in march @entity49 backed plans to decriminalise non-payment of the tv licence fee – which accounts for one in ten magistrates court cases , from next year			0
the @entity1 fears it could lose £ 200million a year from the change and could be forced to close channels			1
there is a growing clamour from mps and the public to reform the @entity163 , but mr @entity6 said this ‘ important decision ’ would also be left until after a new chairman has been appointed			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ he simply said that the next negotiation will need to consider changing technology , which is what every negotiation since the first has done			2
‘ the licence fee , at 40p per day , remains much more popular than alternative methods of funding the @entity1 and we are working hard to offer the public the best value possible for every penny			1

minister says £ 145.50 - a - year fee is a ' large amount ' of money for families
says fee needs to take account of ‘ big technological changes ’ like @entity70
clearest signal yet that @entity189 may cut @entity1 budget after next election
