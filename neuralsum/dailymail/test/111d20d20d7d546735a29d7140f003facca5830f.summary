life expectancy for older women has fallen after decades of rises as unhealthy lifestyles and cuts to social care take their toll life expectancy for older women has fallen after decades of rises as unhealthy lifestyles and cuts to social care take their toll			1
the predicted life spans of women aged 65 , 75 , 85 and 95 fell in 2012 – the first time since 1995 that falls in all four age groups were recorded			1
by 2013 , the average 75 - year - old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks – five weeks less than in 2011 , a @entity12 report shows			2
for a woman aged 85 , the expected span was six years and 42 weeks – two and a half months less			2
the study also found that increasing life expectancy for men in their sixties and seventies had stalled , and had fallen for those in their eighties and nineties			1
if the change becomes a trend , it could mark the end of an expectation by baby boomers that they will continue to live longer and longer			0
life expectancy for @entity33 women is already among the worst in @entity34			1
the findings will add to fears that the rising consumption of alcohol and unhealthy food is taking a terrible toll			0
poor standards in many care homes and reduced home help could also prompt early deaths , experts say			0
the deterioration follows three decades in which annual average life expectancy has increased by 1.2 per cent for men aged 65 and 0.7 per cent for women			1
the study by @entity52 said it was too early to say whether the change was a long - term one			0
professor @entity55 , president of the @entity57 @entity56 , said : ‘ one of the issues we have seen is women living lifestyle ’s becoming more like those of men over recent decades , with more smoking and drinking			2
recent governments had failed to invest in care for an ageing population , professor @entity55 said , leaving insufficient help for the frail and vulnerable			0
he added : ‘ there has been a failure of successive governments in that we should have seen that trends were changing , that more people would be living longer and we needed to put services in place to look after them			0
‘ we are letting down a generation which came back from the war and built the welfare state			0
’ by 2013 , the average 75 - year - old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks – five weeks less than in 2011 , a @entity12 report shows @entity52 said the fall among women aged 65 was the first since 1995 , while that among those aged 75 had not been seen for nine years			1
it called the falls statistically significant			0
since then , the figures for women in their sixties have recovered to their 2011 level , but the 2013 statistics for older women remained worse than those two years earlier			2
it means average life expectancy for a women of 85 is now two and a half months shorter than in 2011			1
health officials need a third year ’s data to establish whether the figures from 2012 and 2013 mean life expectancy is levelling off or entering a more worrying decline			1
the report said : ‘ within @entity52 , although female life expectancy at all four ages fell in 2012 , and for males it fell at ages 85 and 95 and remained static at ages 65 and 75 , it is too early to say whether this represents a slowing in the upward trend or the start of a downward trend			1
’ @entity52 said the impact of the recession could be one reason why life expectancy fell in several @entity127 countries			1
flu outbreaks and cold winters may also be to blame			0
@entity130 , of the charity @entity57 , said : ‘ this decrease in life expectancy , after many years of improvement , is like the canary in the coal mine			1
it is telling us that something has changed for the worse , so that fewer people are thriving in later life than they could or should			2
‘ the most likely culprit is the rapid decline of state - funded social care in recent years , which is leaving hundreds of thousands of older people to struggle on alone at home without any help			0
' this decrease in life expectancy , after many years of improvement , is like the canary in the coal mine ' ‘ more and more older people are living with several incurable conditions and illnesses			1
determined action now to sustain social care and to support older people with multiple long - term health conditions more effectively can hopefully make this a blip , rather than the start of a terrible trend			0
’ despite the new figures , a 65 - year - old man in the @entity57 can expect to live 18 years and six months – still almost five and a half more years than 30 years ago			0
a woman of the same age can expect 21 more years – a gain of almost four years in the last three decades			0
men of 75 can now expect to live 11 years and 15 weeks , with 13 years five weeks for women , while at 85 , men can expect five years and 42 weeks , and women six years and 42 weeks .			2

predicted life spans of women aged 65 , 75 , 85 and 95 fell in 2012
also found increasing life expectancy for men in *60s* and *70s* had stalled
life expectancy for @entity33 women already among worst in @entity34
