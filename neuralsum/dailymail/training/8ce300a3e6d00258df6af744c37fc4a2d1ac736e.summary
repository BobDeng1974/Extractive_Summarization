by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:11 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 18:11 est , 20 october 2012 earning power : @entity3 after winning the @entity4 olympic gold medallist and @entity4 winner @entity6 is slashing his tax bill by using an offshore scheme branded ‘ abusive ’ and ‘ artificial ’ by the @entity9			1
the @entity10 has learned that the seven - time @entity12 medallist , hot favourite for 2012 @entity14 , has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax			1
the 32 - year - old cycling hero who climbed to the top of his sport partly thanks to lottery funding , earned an estimated £ 5 million this year			1
he has joined a complex tax - avoidance partnership , @entity22 , which takes advantage of farming tax reliefs			1
but the @entity9 has taken action to close the loophole and the taxman last night pledged to ‘ investigate and challenge ’ any arrangements put in place before the change in the law			0
@entity33 is controlled by another company , @entity34 , based in the @entity36 tax haven			1
but the firm believed to have set it up , @entity39 - based @entity38 , is also linked to @entity41 ( ‘ no tax ’ ) advisors , the firm criticised for similar schemes involving comedian @entity44 and @entity46 star @entity45			1
@entity45 is also a member of @entity47 , along with @entity48 and 230 other rich investors			0
how much @entity50 invested is not clear , but his spokesman insisted it involved only a ‘ small percentage ’ of his income and the ‘ vast majority ’ of his earnings were taxed at the higher rate of 50 per cent			1
sources say the cyclist paid more than £ 1 million in tax last year			2
@entity62 records show @entity48 joined @entity47 on march 13 this year			2
on the same day , the @entity9 issued a strongly - worded press release referring to an ‘ abusive ’ tax avoidance scheme ’ without naming it			1
@entity66 ( @entity67 ) said it had shut down a ‘ contrived ’ scheme being marketed at the time , and that it would challenge any others put together before march 13			2
used artificial transactions to generate tax relief from a property business that owns agricultural land , ’ said the @entity9 at the time			1
involved : actor @entity45 , posing for a snap with his partner @entity77 taken for a ride ? the seven - time @entity12 medallist has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax ‘ although the land itself and the business owning it will exist , the transactions are not part of any genuine agricultural business			1
they are generated only to create an artificial loss that can be set off by users			0
to reduce their tax bill			2
’ in a @entity33 - type scheme , an individual could end up paying no tax at all , by investing around £ 100,000 yet claiming tax relief on £ 1 million			1
this is achieved as each £ 100,000 is supplemented by a £ 900,000 loan taken out by the partnership			2
that money , after being paid to the farmer , is swiftly repaid to the bank			0
the accountants find a way to artificially ‘ write down ’ the investment to become a loss on paper , even though there was no cash loss			0
the original £ 100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees , but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £ 1 million , which they set against their income			1
tax haven : @entity33 is controlled by another company , @entity34 , based in the @entity36 ( pictured ) last night an @entity67 spokesman , referring to the unnamed march 13 scheme , said : ‘ @entity67 reacted very quickly when this scheme was disclosed and ministers announced a change to the legislation within days			2
' this protected the exchequer by shutting down a scheme that was being marketed at that time			0
@entity67 will challenge any schemes of this type which were implemented before the announcement			0
’ a spokesman for @entity48 said : ‘ the vast majority of @entity3 ’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate			0
the investment in @entity135 involves only a small percentage of @entity3 ’s income			0
@entity3 has paid , and will continue to pay , his fair share of tax			0
’ @entity45 and @entity140 declined to comment			0
@entity38 could not be reached for comment .			0
