by @entity0 welcome to the stroppy summit			0
held in one of @entity5 ’s most spectacular cities , it was designed to discuss the stuttering global economy but overshadowed by the carnage in @entity8			1
and forget any idea of dignified diplomacy to resolve the planet ’s most pressing problems			0
when the world ’s most powerful politicians flew in to @entity16 , they indulged in an abject display of posturing , preening and petulance			1
the @entity20 began with juvenile jinks over the seating at dinner and ended with open feuding among presidents and prime ministers representing two - thirds of the world ’s population			0
all for show ? there may have been public smiles , but there remains much disagreement between @entity35 and @entity36 - not least with regard to @entity8 at the centre of it all was @entity35 , the prickly @entity40 president hosting the bash amid the baroque splendours of a @entity44 city built three centuries ago as a symbol of his nation ’s strength			1
his determination to protect @entity50 , his murderous @entity8 ally who buys so much @entity40 weaponry , intensified a new @entity52 with the @entity53			1
and it was a tough two days for @entity36 : shunted to the sidelines by @entity57 ’s reluctance to intervene against @entity50 , the butt of barbs from the @entity40 , and summoned to a testy meeting with @entity35 at 2am where they rowed for 20 minutes over @entity8			1
@entity36 also raised the issue of deteriorating gay rights , which have prompted calls for a boycott of next year ’s winter olympics in @entity67			2
his belligerent host replied that he needed @entity40 to make more children , but promised gay athletes and visitors faced no discrimination			2
even as world leaders tucked into their salmon blinis and venison at the showcase dinner in the @entity78 , @entity36 ’s advisers were frantically working out a response to the jibe that defined his trip to @entity40			1
welcome : @entity35 was his usual , boisterous self as he hosted the @entity82 in @entity16 @entity35 ’s spokesman was said to have dismissed @entity84 as ‘ the small island no one listens to ’ , going on to joke about his country ’s oligarchs ‘ buying @entity89 ’			1
yet the slur underscored @entity36 ’s reduced role at this surreal shindig – along with his nation ’s uncertainty over its rightful place in a fast - changing world			2
one source close to @entity99 president @entity98 said @entity36 had been neutered by the refusal of mps to back military action in @entity8			1
others were even more direct about the impact of the parliamentary vote ten days ago			0
‘ @entity84 has been made to look less reliable on the world stage , and @entity57 has diminished the @entity109 , ’ said one of @entity36 ’s closest colleagues			1
the prime minister responded to the @entity40 jibe by rhapsodising over our role in shaping the world – although his claim that @entity84 defeated fascism must have rankled in a country that lost 20 million people in the @entity119			1
say ' cheese ' : @entity40 's president @entity35 , center front , stands with @entity20 leaders during a group photo outside of the @entity125 in @entity16 , @entity40 on friday , where @entity8 's civil war became the hot topic of conversation @entity129 : the dinner table of the @entity20 summit at @entity78 in @entity16 , @entity40 , where the @entity20 summit took place but it diverted attention from the harsh realities of the summit , which as key @entity139 insiders admitted , must have been difficult for @entity36 given his deep - felt desire to respond to @entity8 atrocities			1
yet @entity36 , while still arguing passionately for intervention , had to focus on pushing the cause of increased humanitarian aid rather than play the pivotal role he so desired in the unfolding drama over possible @entity53 - led attacks on @entity8			1
so while @entity98 discussed war plans with @entity149 , @entity36 discussed a possible trade trip with @entity152 ’s leader @entity151			2
from the start of this fractious summit there were symbolic differences			0
all the leaders were delivered in @entity40 - assembled @entity158 – except for @entity149 , last to arrive in his own @entity159 for the briefest possible handshake with his host			2
tensions boiled over at the sumptuous dinner that evening in the gilded palace			0
@entity149 turned up late again after working phones to win support for the looming @entity168 vote on intervention , then went straight over for a strategic huddle with @entity36			1
for the next three hours , the leaders put their case on @entity8 while waiters bought a succession of desserts and topped up wine glasses			2
@entity36 , @entity149 and @entity178 premier @entity177 led arguments for a forceful response to the use of chemical weapons			2
@entity184 ’s @entity183 was more cautious , while @entity152 , @entity185 and @entity186 were among those joining @entity40 in opposing any attacks without @entity190 backing			2
conflict continues to rage in @entity8 , as men were pictured fleeing flames caused by a bombing in @entity8 's @entity196 province devastation : a video obtained from the @entity199 showed the bomb 's destructive aftermath the tension between the two key players – @entity149 and @entity35 – was palpable			1
‘ it was not exactly what you would call a debate , more the staking out of positions , ’ said one source			0
the low point came when @entity212 , the botoxed @entity213 president , droned on for 25 minutes about her country ’s history and past wars			0
@entity36 eventually took out his translation earpiece and swung it ostentatiously from his fingers			2
afterwards , the weary world leaders trooped outside to watch dancing and fireworks			0
following his late - night meeting with @entity35 , @entity36 snatched two hours ’ sleep before the second day ’s round of tense discussions and tetchy press conferences			0
on friday evening , as participants clashed publicly in their final pronouncements , @entity35 made an alarming pledge to ‘ help ’ @entity50 in the event of air strikes			0
even for this pugnacious president , it was a gobsmacking response after a gathering of global leaders and following the use of chemical weapons to slaughter civilians			0
last time some of these leaders met – at the @entity241 meeting three months ago on the banks of @entity243 – @entity35 cut an isolated figure defending @entity50			0
it came less than a week after the @entity53 announced plans to provide military support for rebels			0
the video , authenticated based on its contents and other @entity252 reporting , showed smoke rising from bombardments and clashes between free @entity8 army fighters and government forces in the town of @entity259 this time , however , the @entity40 leader clearly enjoyed exacting revenge on @entity36 and @entity149 , who after the @entity263 summit had compared him to ‘ a bored kid in the back of the classroom ’			1
as @entity36 left @entity16 he was given a @entity40 doll with his face on it			1
inside , were smaller and smaller dolls of his @entity139 predecessors going back to a tiny @entity273 at the core			0
was this a kind gift – or one more dig ? meanwhile , a weakened @entity149 flew back to @entity278 facing a battle to persuade @entity168 to authorise military action			0
ten of the other @entity20 nations signed a statement accusing @entity50 of carrying out the chemical attacks , yet only @entity99 among them is offering forces in support			0
there is no doubt who the biggest losers were after this motley collection of world leaders spent two days in @entity294 palaces striking poses over @entity8			0
as @entity36 said , there is one new refugee created every 15 seconds in a savage civil war that has left 100,000 people dead – and for all the pontificating in @entity16 , an end to their plight seems further away than ever .			1

plenty of disagreement over dinner in @entity16
@entity36 still *smarting* of @entity40 's ' little country ' jibe at the @entity84
is @entity36 shunted to the outside after @entity8 intervention vote defeat ?
