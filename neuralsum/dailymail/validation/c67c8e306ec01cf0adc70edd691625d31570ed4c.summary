an unusual time - lapse video made by a @entity2 nonprofit fundraiser and his friends shows former secretary of state @entity5 aging from her teen years to the present			1
@entity8 , 67 , is the presumptive @entity11 @entity10 front - runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections			1
that would make her the second - oldest chief executive to move into the @entity10 behind only @entity17 , who took office 17 days before he turned 70			1
' i will not exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience , ' he said during a memorable debate			2
the new video , from a trio calling themselves the ' @entity8 ' project , shows mrs. @entity5 in 28 separate photos , each morphing into the next at 2 - second intervals			1
one of the project 's creators told @entity51 that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer			2
' i do n't think her age disqualifies her from becoming president , but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s			2
' he said , requesting anonymity because his job does n't involve partisan politicking			0
' our video is simply an exercise in branding			2
we have no money behind us , ' he added , calling the effort ' just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people			0
' he said there will be more videos hitting the project 's @entity81 page if mrs. @entity5 takes the plunge and runs for president			1
there 's no indication most @entity27 today believe age should be a disqualifying factor for a presidential run			1
one poll even indicates @entity8 has hid hers well			2
a @entity93 survey released a year ago found that ' the public tends to underestimate @entity5 ’s age , ' with 60 being the median guess			1
a whopping 53 per cent of young voters , those under age 30 , told @entity93 's pollsters that mrs. @entity5 was in her 50s			1
another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50			0
age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on tuesday			0
@entity104 and beyond : @entity8 in 1969 at @entity106 ( left ) , in a 1975 portrait ( center ) and four years later in 1979 ( right ) , when she was 32 years old @entity10 years : then - first lady @entity8 pictured ( left to right ) in 1993 , 1995 and 1997 after a @entity21 session on women 's global progress where a @entity116 diplomat introduced her to cheers as a ' future president , ' she faced a gauntlet of hungry reporters in an attempt to explain an email scandal that has brought her an undesirable form of public attention			1
mrs. @entity5 told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state			1
she also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted , none of them vetted by the @entity134 for materials subject to the @entity136			0
that law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs			0
@entity8 , who has been an attorney , the first lady of @entity145 and the @entity27 , a @entity27 senator and @entity27 's top diplomat , is expected to make a decision on running for president – or staying on the sidelines – next month			1
in the public spotlight : @entity8 spent eight years as a @entity152 ( left , in 2001 ) , ultimately conceded a presidential primary race to @entity154 in 2008 ( center ) , and led the @entity156 for four tumultuous years ( right , in 2013 ) 1			2
@entity17 : 69 years , 349 days 2			1
@entity157 : 68 years , 23 days 3			0
@entity158 : 65 years , 315 days 4			0
@entity159 : 64 years , 222 days 5			0
@entity160 : 64 years , 100 days 6			0
@entity161 : 62 years , 98 days 7			0
@entity162 : 61 years , 354 days 8			0
@entity163 : 61 years , 125 days 9			0
@entity164 : 61 years , 26 days 10			0
@entity165 : 60 years , 339 days source : ' @entity167 ' by @entity168 and @entity169 the grueling schedule of a @entity10 run could take its toll no matter how fit mrs. @entity5 is , according to @entity173 columnist @entity172			1
' in secretary @entity8 's last year at her post , particularly the last few months at the @entity134 , the position clearly took a toll on her health ; she experienced an episode of fainting or passing out , and suffered a head injury , ' @entity172 wrote last month			1
' none of this necessarily is to argue against her running , but she would be undertaking something that , as she well knows , is considerably more physically demanding even than her previous position , and at an older age			0
' however history unfolds , the new time - lapse video 's soundtrack seems to describe the inevitable outcome of the 2016 campaign just right			2
' when the band stops playing , ' a soulful singer intones on the video 's backing track , ' only one will be left dancing in the round ' – or in this case , in the @entity197 .			2

video produced by nonprofit fundraiser and two friends shows former secretary of state 's *changing* looks through the years
@entity5 would be 69 if she were to become president in *january* 2017 , making her the second oldest to be inaugurated and less than a year younger than @entity17 when he took office
@entity27 *generally* think she 's younger than her actual age , especially voters under age 30 – most of whom say she 's in her 50s or *40s*
' @entity8 ' project promises more videos if the former senator and first lady runs for the @entity10
