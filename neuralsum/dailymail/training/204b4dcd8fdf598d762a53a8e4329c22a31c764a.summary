by @entity0 last updated at 1:52 am on 1st november 2011 it was supposed to be a symbolic gesture to mark a global milestone			1
but when the @entity5 declared a baby from the @entity7 the world ’s seven billionth human , it sparked worldwide howls of ‘ oh no she is n’t ’			1
parents from @entity13 to @entity14 scrambled to claim that their child was in fact the landmark baby			2
what 's all the fuss about ? @entity19 is oblivious to the significance of her arrival proud : @entity23 and son @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 and son @entity22 in @entity27 of course , with hundreds of thousands of births each day , it is impossible to pinpoint the true holder of the title			1
but the @entity5 chose to mark the event by welcoming @entity33 , who was born two minutes before midnight on sunday to a struggling family in @entity35 , with a chocolate cake marked ‘ @entity39 ’ and a gift certificate for free shoes			1
her mother @entity40 said : ‘ she looks so lovely			2
i ca n’t believe she is the world ’s seven billionth			1
’ not to be outdone , officials in @entity45 – the most populous state in @entity14 – appointed seven girls born yesterday to share the honour			0
they included @entity48 , daughter of @entity49 and @entity50			0
delight : @entity52 and his mother , left , and @entity49 and @entity54 with @entity55 , right @entity13 has a candidate , too			0
soon after his birth at @entity58 , @entity25 , at 6.58am yesterday , @entity24 was presented with a @entity60 teddy bear by @entity63 peer @entity61 , @entity65 mp @entity64 and hospital staff			0
mother @entity23 , from @entity67 , south @entity25 , said : ‘ we will be able to tell him he was the seven billionth baby when he gets older			2
it felt like he was fighting to get out			0
maybe he wanted to be famous			0
’ there were also celebrations following declarations by officials in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity27 – @entity26 ’s son @entity78 – and @entity79 – @entity52			0
sadly , it ’s unlikely to be a title that will carry much weight			0
the families of @entity84 from @entity85 , named as the sixth billionth baby , and @entity84 , from @entity87 , who was number five billion , have complained the @entity5 has ignored them ever since			1
something to celebrate : proud father @entity89 holds a cake marking the significance of his daughter 's birth the @entity7 ' health secretary @entity94 said the arrival of the world 's seven billionth baby presented his country with an opportunity to assess population related issues			1
according to the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) @entity103 , the @entity7 is the 12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people			2
@entity106 continues to have the biggest share of the population at 1.35 billion , followed by @entity14 at 1.24 billion .			1

@entity5 *recognises* @entity19 as one of the world 's symbolic ' seven billionth ' babies , presenting her with a *special* cake
the @entity5 say seven billion day **-** *october* *31* **-** is the date when the world 's population *reaches* landmark number
