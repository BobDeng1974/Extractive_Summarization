a @entity1 sexology professor is calling for students to view pornography films in class as part of changes to the country 's sex education curriculum			1
professor @entity9 said the changes would help students understand the differences between what they see in pornography and the reality of sex			1
his suggestion echoes similar calls made in @entity17 last year by a government - backed sexual health forum , which said youngsters must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life			2
@entity1 students could soon be watching pornography films in class in order to teach them the differences between what they see on screen and the reality of sex mr @entity9 told public broadcaster @entity30 : ' instead of having sex education be boring and technical , where you roll a condom onto a cucumber , i 'd rather have us educate our children to be critical consumers who see porn with a certain distance and reflection , ' according to @entity44			1
he added that teenagers attempting to copy what they saw in pornography was a ' recipe for broken necks and disappointment '			1
@entity1 is known for its liberal attitudes to pornography - it was the first country to legalise it , and a recent survey showed three quarters of @entity1 men , and a third of @entity1 women , regularly watch it , @entity44 reported			2
early last year in @entity17 , a document drawn up by sexual health charity @entity59 , the @entity61 and the @entity62 issued new guidelines for sex education in schools			0
the guidelines , criticised by an education campaigner for ' taking children 's childhoods away from them ' - also called for students to be told about the dangers of ' sexting ' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images			0
pupils must instead be taught the difference between real - life relationships and the distorted world of x-rated films			0
this could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘ @entity85 ’ or ‘ @entity91 ’ and a greater emphasis on relationships , sexuality and staying safe , rather than just the ' mechanics ' of reproduction .			0
