the 39 - year - old dreams of the day she can get her debilitating condition under control and settle down with her ideal partner			0
@entity7 , 39 , has severe obsessive compulsive disorder as well as asperger syndrome but dating poses a horrifying number of issues for ms @entity7 , who has n’t invited anyone into her flat for more than three years and who only leaves home to shop or visit her mother			1
she finds it extremely stressful to meet new people and to spend time in public places , and her aversion to eye contact means any first date could be disastrous			2
ms @entity7 , from @entity34 , said : ‘ any relationship i did have would have to be completely non-contact - an old - fashioned @entity37 style courtship			2
‘ my main worry is contamination from other people so there could n’t be any physical interaction - no hugs , kisses , hand holding - i would need to trust someone before anything like that could happen			2
‘ if i could meet the right person i would be so happy , but there are just so many extra obstacles that stand in my way because of my ocd and asperger syndrome			1
‘ my fear of germs makes it hard for me to go out for food in public too , even something as simple as sitting on a seat in public scares me			0
ms @entity7 is desperate to find love but her ocd and asperger syndrome make this very difficult ms @entity7 is terrified of germs so will not hold hands with anyone , kiss or cuddle			1
she only leaves her home to go to the shops and to visit her mother			2
she has not invited anyone into her flat for more than three years ‘ and i find social interactions very difficult especially with people i do n’t know or have never met before - it ’s all very stressful for me			2
dating just throws all of these problems at me in one go			0
‘ as much as i hope i might meet that special someone - i know they would have to accept who i am and be open about my mental health issues			0
’ ms @entity7 - who was diagnosed with asperger syndrome two years ago - believes that it has been subconsciously affecting her relationships her entire life			1

‘ but i found it was a huge relief when i was diagnosed			0
i had always known there was something different and not quite right			0
‘ i think i can live with the asperger syndrome , that ’s part of who i am			1
but i ca n’t live with the @entity3 being as bad as it is now - it ’s pretty much as bad as it gets			0
‘ people think @entity3 is all about cleaning , but it ’s not			2
for me , it ’s all about fear and fear completely controls my life and i need to do something to make life a bit more liveable			0
‘ it ’s like a snowball , it slowly gathers speed and over the years things have slowly got worse and worse			0
and the older i ’ve got , the more i have found to worry about			0
’ ms @entity7 ’s extreme @entity3 has left her terrified of even the most simple interactions leaving her confined to her flat for the majority of the time			1
the extremity of her condition has increased over the past five years and ms @entity7 turned to internet dating with the hope of meeting someone to share her life with			1
reluctant to give up her search for ‘ the one ’ , she said : ‘ i have used internet dating sites in the hope of meeting someone special but it is so hard to know when to be honest with people			1
‘ i have been open and honest on my profile straight away , and had absolutely no messages from anyone			0
‘ and i have hidden my mental health issues from people and we ’ve started talking , but as soon as i have been honest they have dropped off the radar and i never hear from them again			0
‘ it ’s just so difficult to know when to open up , but i just feel like why should i have to hide who i am ? ’ ms @entity7 says she has tried internet dating but that potential partners lose interest in her when they learn about her ocd and asperger syndrome ms @entity7 said : ' as much as i hope i might meet that special someone - i know they would have to accept who i am and be open about my mental health issues ' @entity187 , from the @entity126 , said : ‘ asperger syndrome is a form of autism , a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to others			1
‘ for some people with autism , even ordinary , everyday conversation and social interaction can lead to misunderstandings , confusion or upset , and so negotiating the ‘ minefield ’ of more intimate relationships can be challenging			1
‘ the social and communication difficulties that people with autism experience can sometimes make it hard for them to form close friendships and relationships , but the majority would like to have more friends			2
‘ it ’s vital that more is done to support those with the condition so that they do not become isolated , and befriending services and social groups can make a world of difference			0
