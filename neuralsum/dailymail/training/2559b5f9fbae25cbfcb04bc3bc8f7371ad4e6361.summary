an illegal immigrant who gave a face to the crime ' total identity theft ' has plea guilty for federal prosecutors in a plea deal on charges of stealing the persona of a @entity10 elementary teacher			1
@entity11 , 32 , pled guilty monday in a @entity13 courthouse to reduced charges of possessing fradulent identification documents			1
prosecutors agreed to recommend an 18 - month prison term when the @entity19 national who resides in @entity20 is sentenced in march			1
defrauded : @entity10 school teacher @entity23 , pictured had her identity stolen several years ago and has been battling with the government since @entity23 learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago			1
now she trudges to the @entity26 with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport to prove her identity she has agreed not to contest deportation once her sentence is complete			1
booked : @entity32 will likely be sentenced to 18 months in prison before being deported for her crimes defense attorney @entity35 told reporters after the hearing that @entity32 was sorry for her actions and did n't wish to hurt @entity23			1
@entity32 did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts			0
she assumed @entity23 's persona completely , using it to get a job , a driver 's license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children			1
all the while , the crook claimed the real @entity23 was the one who had stolen her identity			1
the women 's kafkaesque nightmare puts a face on ' total identity theft , ' a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go far beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person 's life			2
the scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen @entity26 numbers to get paid at their jobs , and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting @entity70			2
' when she claimed my identity and i claimed it back , she was informed that i was claiming it too , ' said @entity23 , a 31 - year - old @entity10 elementary school teacher			1
' she knew i was aware and that i was trying to fight , and yet she would keep fighting			0
it is not like she realized and she stopped			0
no , she kept going , and she kept going harder			0
' @entity11 used @entity23 's identity during a 10 - year period when she worked at a @entity20 company that packages refrigerated foods			1
for years , large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen @entity26 numbers			0
however , as electronic employment verification systems such as e-verify become more common , the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult			0
now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone			0
for victims , total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to @entity26 numbers get mixed up , putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life - threatening allergies			1
when @entity23 's identity was stolen , the thief did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts			1
she assumed her persona completely , using it to get a job , a license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children nationwide , employment - related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year			1
but in states with large immigrant populations , employment - related identity fraud was much higher : 25 percent in @entity120 , 15 percent in @entity121 , 16 percent in @entity122 , 12 percent in @entity123			2
prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else 's identity , the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working			1
' it is such a horrible nightmare			0
you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help			0
but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a big inconvenience			0
' once they have become established in a community , identity thieves do n't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else			0
that 's when they take the next step and get a driver 's license , a home loan and health insurance			2
' and so that is a natural progression , and that is what we are seeing , ' said assistant u.s. attorney @entity155 , who is prosecuting the case against @entity23 's alleged impostor			1
@entity23 first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago			1
now each year she trudges to the @entity26 with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record			2
she spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus , fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history			0
her tax records are a mess			0
she even once phoned the impostor 's @entity13 employer in a futile effort to find some relief			0
both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new social security numbers			0
the @entity26 turned down the request from @entity23 , instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her			2
@entity183 statistics show that @entity70 reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011 , up from 251,100 a year earlier and in another ironic twist , @entity23 was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants			2
' it is such a horrible nightmare , ' @entity23 said			2
' you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help			0
... but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a super big inconvenience			0
you have to find the time for someone who is abusing you			0
' when @entity23 recently got married , her husband began researching identity theft on the @entity203 and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at @entity206 , the same manufacturer where @entity11 worked			1
he contacted federal authorities in @entity13 and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife 's identity			1
the alleged impostor was arrested in august , and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered @entity11 in 1996 in @entity216 , @entity121 , and sent her back to @entity122 .			2
