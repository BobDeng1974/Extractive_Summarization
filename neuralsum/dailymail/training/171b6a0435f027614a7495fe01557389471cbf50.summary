published : 18:10 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 14:49 est , 27 february 2013 parents desperate to conceive feel they have no choice but to travel to @entity3 clinics to spend thousands of dollars in cash on a controversial and potentially dangerous blood therapy suspended in the @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity8 tried and failed at great expense to become pregnant using @entity10 - the technique pioneered by @entity12 lymphocyte immunization therapy or @entity10 is fast becoming a last resort for couples for whom @entity16 and natural conception has failed but because it is not offered by @entity6 insurance firms would - be moms and dads are flooding over the border in hope			1
pioneered by @entity6 fertility physician dr. @entity23 , his eponymous @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , is actively encouraging parents into shady dealings with @entity3 physicians during which cash is handed over in turn for access to treatment			1
dr. @entity23 , who died in 2006 , theorized that a woman 's immune system can become hyper - defensive , mistaking her partner 's sperm as a disease and actively stop a fetus from growing			2
' effectively , women become serial killers of their own babies , ' he wrote in his 2006 book , ' is @entity44 ? ' reported the @entity45			0
beer argued that @entity10 works by injecting a woman with her partner 's blood cells until her immune system fails to see them as foreign - much like an allergy shot in reverse			1
the science of @entity10 argues that the therapy blocks prospective mother 's antibodies who have been trained to see male sperm as foreign invaders			1
the course of treatment also is supposed to shift the body 's immune response to a state where it accepts foreign cells			0
beer claimed the credit for pioneering the treatment in the @entity6 and said that in @entity3 , @entity10 was responsible for achieving an astounding 78 percent success rate in parents who attended clinics there			1
dr. @entity69 pioneered the use of @entity10 before it was suspended in the @entity6 and claimed an extraordinary success rate for pregnancies with it however , a 1999 study by the @entity81 with women who had had more than three miscarriages came to different conclusions			1
eighty - six subjects over the course of their research underwent a course in @entity10 and 85 patients received a placebo according to the @entity45			1
one - third of the @entity10 patients became pregnant , but 50 percent of the control group also became pregnant			1
' this therapy , ' the researchers concluded , ' should not be offered as a treatment for pregnancy loss			2
' so , in 2002 the @entity97 suspended it , citing the scientific findings of the @entity81 that it does not work			1
however , that move left prospective parents such as @entity7 and @entity8 without another option once natural conception and @entity16 had failed			0
ruling out adoption , and feeling the advance of time , 38 - year - old @entity7 and her husband traveled to the @entity108 in @entity25 for help			2
despite @entity10 being illegal in the @entity6 , this has not stopped the doctors at @entity112 's from directing hundreds of patients to leave the country to undergo the procedure - all paying cash in hand			1
' they 're couples who are very , very frustrated , ' said dr. @entity119 , the clinic 's director			2
' they 've been through the system			0
they 've been told , ' oh , if you just do this , it 'll work			0
oh , if you just do @entity16 ( in vitro fertilization ) , it 'll work			0
' i 'm very convinced that this approach of going after the immune system , and making adjustments there , is an approach which is based rationally and does work			0
' @entity108 in @entity25 , @entity26 is not considered a bone - fide fertility clinic because it does not handle male sperm or female eggs encouraged by the physicians at @entity25 , the @entity7 's approached a clinic just over the @entity141 border in @entity142 , @entity3 , run by dr. @entity143			1
subsequently contacted via email by the doctor 's assistant , the @entity7 's were asked to travel to meet in a @entity147 's in @entity148 and to bring $ 600			2
' it seems so movie - like , ' @entity7 recalled later to the @entity45			2
' i did n't know what to expect			0
' the nervous couple were told to leave their hotel the next day and drove to the border where they were instructed they would be picked up			2
dr @entity119 of the @entity158 - is a staunch proponent of @entity10 a van arrived and inside was dr. @entity143 and another couple from @entity161 headed for the clinic in @entity142 also			1
altogether the group were transported across the border to @entity3 to @entity142 , known for its booming private cosmetic , dental and fertility clinics			1
taken up to dr. @entity143 's second floor office , he drew out @entity8 's blood and made a solution from his white blood cells and then gave @entity7 four shots in each arm			2
the procedure was so fast that later that afternoon they were back in @entity141			1
soon after , @entity7 developed red marks and itching on her skin - a common side - effect according to a 2006 survey of 2,600 @entity10 patients in @entity182			1
failing to fall pregnant over the course of the first treatment , the @entity183 paid for an additional four to the tune of $ 3,450 , plus travel costs - but they felt this was a deal compared to the $ 12,000 average cost of @entity16 they had paid before			1
' you have a therapy that does not cost nearly as much as what @entity16 costs , ' said @entity25 clinic director winger to the @entity45 , ' and you can prevent needing a second failed @entity16			2
' the @entity25 clinic is adamant it does not receive any money from @entity10 treatments that their patients seek outside the country			1
also , the @entity25 clinic does not perform any treatments in which eggs and sperm are handled , the @entity204 does not class it as a fertility clinic			0
however , because of this and their experimental approach to medicine , many experts are unconvinced			0
' there 's no scientific evidence that 's consistent to support this theory , ' said the @entity7 's own fertility physician at their local hospital to the @entity45			0
' but there have been a handful of patients who conceive after the immunotherapy			2
' ' it makes no sense whatsoever and it 's potentially dangerous , ' said dr. @entity221 , a physician at the @entity222 of @entity223 and a critic of @entity112			0
' i 'm surprised anyone in this country is still doing anything along those lines			0
' the @entity3 / @entity6 border - @entity141 is on the left and @entity142 is on the right despite all their efforts , last year , after another miscarriage , the @entity7 's decided to use a surrogate in @entity235 and halt @entity236 ' i do n't know if they ( @entity12 's clinic ) would have ever said , ' you guys ought to try something else , maybe we ca n't help you after all , ' said @entity7 to the @entity45			1
however , one patient , @entity242 , 41 , of @entity243 in @entity26 has given @entity12 's program the thumbs up after she became pregnant with twin boys			0
she already had a daughter in 2007 , but failed to conceive again and miscarried six times in three years			0
learning of @entity10 on the @entity249 , she went to the beer clinic who told her she had a two percent chance of falling pregnant without their help			1
deciding to follow their advice she made her way to @entity3 : ' i do n't believe that i would have my twins if i had n't gone through their protocol , ' she said			2
' the conception was never the problem , ' she added			0
' it 's holding onto the pregnancy that was the problem			0
so i think it 's the way my body reacted to a pregnancy that had changed			0
' however , @entity7 could never understand why she could n't fall pregnant , but is magnanimous about the program			0
' i know other women and they do go through the beer protocol and it works for them , ' she said			0
' but it did n't work for me			0

couples at their wits end hoping to conceive are being encouraged to travel to @entity3 to undergo a controversial blood therapy
lymphocyte immunization therapy or @entity10 has been suspended in the @entity6 since 2002
couples are paying thousands of dollars to undergo the therapy - just across the border from @entity141
