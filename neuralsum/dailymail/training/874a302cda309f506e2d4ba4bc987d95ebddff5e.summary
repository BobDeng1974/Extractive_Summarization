if you assumed the dirty grease from your sunday roast was useless , think again - it could soon be making you a cup of tea			0
scientists are on a mission to conquer the giant ' fatbergs ' clogging @entity11 's sewers by generating electricity from used cooking oil			2
so - called ' fat vats ' - resembling a kitchen - top compost bin - have been handed out to residents of @entity17 , @entity18 , in a trial which would be rolled out to thousands of homes			1
@entity29 , 19 ( pictured ) is part of the trial fancy a cuppa ? a water firm hopes these ' fatbergs ' in the sewers of @entity17 , @entity18 , will soon be a thing of the past			1
a five - litre ' fat vat ' filled by just one house would provide enough power for 1,250 cups of tea appetising : the water firm released revolting photos of its blocked sewers to stop people pouring oil away the 85 households will pour their leftover cooking oil , fat and grease into the five - litre plastic tubs which will be collected fortnightly by their local water firm			1
@entity53 will then take the samples to a centre near @entity56 run by the renewable energy firm called @entity58 , where they will be converted into bio-electricity			0
it is claimed 1,000 litres of oil - weighing about a tonne - would generate enough electricity to power an average home for a year			1
that is enough to make 250,000 cups of tea or power a microwave for 3,000 hours - the equivalent of 125 days ' continual use			2
just one of the household vats would provide enough energy to boil the kettle 1,250 times			1
the system works by pumping oil into ' settling tanks ' , where it is left for two to five weeks to let impurities settle to the bottom where they can be removed			0
trial : the system is beginning with 85 homes and could be expanded by politicians , volunteers and water bosses ( pictured at @entity17 's @entity89 ) blockage : the sewers of @entity91 , where the trial is taking place , have been obstructed 80 times pipe : water firms warn even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems down the drain the lighter , purer oil is then filtered and used in combined heat and power stations , where it produces heat for homes and electricity which can be used on the @entity108			1
it comes after warnings by water engineers that our love of fatty food is causing dangerous blockages in @entity11 's sewers			0
last summer a 15 - ton fatberg the size of a bus was found in sewers under @entity120 , south west @entity121 , after resident complained they could n't flush their toilets			2
the revolting mass of congealed fat and wet wipes took three weeks to remove and was said to be days from forcing raw sewage out of manhole covers across @entity120			0
water firms have warned that even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems once it goes down the drain			2
a @entity53 spokesman said 110,000 tonnes of used cooking oil is thrown away by @entity11 households every year , enough to provide carbon - neutral power to 110,000 homes			1
gross : this fatberg the size of a bus was found last summer under the streets of @entity120 , @entity121 the company spent Â£ 2.3million improving the region 's sewers last year to modernise them and prevent blockages			2
the scheme is being rolled out in 85 homes in co-ordination with the @entity89 in @entity91			0
the area has been hit particularly badly by sewer blockages with 80 in the last year			1
the water firm said the main cause was identified as cooking oils being poured down people 's sinks , which later solidify in sewers			0
@entity53 technician @entity158 said : ' a lot of people do n't realise the damage this can do because these liquids solidify when they get down to the sewers and that can cause blockages			0
' we are all now looking forward to experiencing the benefits that this new trial will be			0

kitchen - top plastic tubs are being trialled across @entity17 , @entity18
the contents will be collected fortnightly and sent to a *bio-energy* plant
sewers in the area have been blocked by fat 80 times in just one year
just one of the five - litre tubs is enough to boil the kettle 1,250 times
1,000 litres of oil would power the average home for a whole year
