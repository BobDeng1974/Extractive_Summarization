by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:14 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 05:58 est , 7 july 2013 rumours : @entity4 and wife @entity5 are said to have been heard arguing friends of @entity4 last night said they feared renewed strains in his marriage to wife @entity5 may have led to a series of volcanic outbursts at mps from the speaker ’s chair			1
mr @entity4 ’s fragile relations with conservative mps have been stretched to breaking point after the series of spectacular clashes in recent weeks			2
it has led to rumours at @entity21 that frustration over his marriage has spilled over into his job of chairing commons debates			0
an official close to the speaker last night insisted there was ‘ no truth ’ in the reports and said the couple were still together at their grace - and - favour residence overlooking the @entity33			1
however , it is not the first time the @entity38 ’ marriage has been thought to be under strain , with reports of the couple being overheard shouting and arguing with each other			1
until a few weeks ago , the tall figure of mrs @entity44 was a familiar sight in the @entity21 – either walking with her husband or driving to and from their apartment			0
but mps say they have not seen the mother of three around the @entity51 for weeks and claim her apparent absence has coincided with increasingly ‘ eccentric ’ behaviour from her husband in the speaker ’s chair – with @entity56 mps bearing the brunt			1
a series of explosions last week began when he bawled out mild - mannered @entity61 and @entity63 @entity56 mp @entity62 for apparently heckling a @entity64 mp			0
aggressive : speaker @entity4 has been erupting with anger more regularly in the @entity51 recently mr @entity4 yelled : ‘ be quiet , and if you can not be quiet , get out			1
you are adding nothing , and you are subtracting a lot			0
it is rude , it is stupid , it is pompous and it needs to stop			0
’ but to the speaker ’s embarrassment , @entity56 minister @entity73 owned up that he was the heckler , with mr @entity62 the innocent party			2
the eruption was followed up two days later with a withering rebuke of defence secretary @entity79 over his handling of a @entity51 statement on @entity83 reforms			2
to the fury of mr @entity79 ’s colleagues , mr @entity4 accused the minister of ‘ utter incompetent ’ and ‘ woefully inadequate ’ behaviour			0
one senior @entity56 mp said : ‘ i would n’t talk to my dog the way @entity4 spoke to @entity79			0
’ but unabashed , the speaker later that day reignited his long - running feud with @entity56 transport minister @entity93 after mr @entity93 clashed with @entity94 who were heckling him			1
happier times : @entity4 and @entity5 at his victorious election count when he was re-elected as mp for @entity97 in 2010 a furious mr @entity4 accused mr @entity93 of hypocrisy and said he was a ‘ slow learner ’ who had to ‘ raise his game ’			1
the previous week , @entity56 @entity94 claim the speaker failed to discipline a @entity64 mp who allegedly made an offensive gesture to chancellor @entity105 during his statement on the spending review			1
witnesses say @entity56 backbencher @entity109 wrote the name of the offending @entity64 mp on a note and handed it to the speaker only to see mr @entity4 rip it up in front of him			0
the speaker ’s office said they had found ‘ no evidence ’ of a @entity64 mp behaving in this manner .			2

the @entity38 ’ marriage is thought to be under strain
@entity94 have not seen mother of three @entity5 around the @entity51 for weeks
the speaker *'s* outbursts are *suspected* to be caused by trouble at home
