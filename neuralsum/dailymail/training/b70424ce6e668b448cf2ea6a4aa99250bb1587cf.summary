the first @entity1 - style burial chamber built in @entity2 for 5,000 years is set to open this weekend - and 45 customers have already paid for their ashes to be stored there			1
with space initially for 2,400 ‘ customers ’ , people can reserve a slot for £ 1,000 ( $ 1,630 ) each			1
the tomb , designed by farmer @entity11 , has been positioned to let the midwinter sunrise shine right down the length of the chamber where people ’s ashes will be placed in urns set into the walls			1
farmer @entity11 is preparing to open his neolithic - style tomb ( shown )			1
the chamber is located near the @entity22 town of @entity23			1
people can buy a space in the tomb to have their ashes stored after their death for £ 1,000 ( $ 1,630 ) the burial chamber sees an official opening reception party on saturday morning on farmland outside the @entity22 village of @entity23 , where it is based			1
mr @entity11 and his team began work in january to build the tomb from thousands of tons of rock , covered by grass			1
and mr @entity11 , who won planning permission last year , said : ' to see it finished after all the hard work - it ’s turned out far better than expected			1
' he ’s also a steward at @entity42 a few miles away and says the tomb is the perfect place for people who want to put the urns of their loved ones in a non-religious place			1
he said : ' i ’ve been amazed at the response - it ’s a different way to remember someone , and the place is modern and ancient at the same time			1
' initially he can store the cremated remains of 2,400 people in 250 niches inside four chambers , though the eventual plan is 350 niches in seven chambers			2
entire families can reserve their own ‘ room ’ in the tomb , which has no religious links although it ’s already attracting pagan worshippers , said @entity11 , a self - confessed atheist			1
' a lot of its appeal is down to the stonemason coming up with the idea of how to build it and insisting on doing it the proper way , using real traditional materials and methods			0
that ’s paying off in spades , with the quality of it and the feel of the place			2
' for some of it , the stone has almost told us how to do it			0
at the entrance , when they fitted together it just felt right and it looks right			0
' @entity22 is strewn with @entity1 burial mounds , or barrows , dating back to the new stone age period , beginning about 10,200 @entity94 and ending between 4,500 and 2,000 bc. they were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud , soil and grass			1
@entity101 , pictured , dates back to the @entity1 period but mystery still surrounds its original purpose @entity105 , six miles from @entity107 's barrow at @entity23 , is one of the largest , measuring 100 metres ( 330 feet ) long			1
excavations suggest work began on the tomb , which has five sarsen stone chambers , in 3,600 @entity94 - some 400 years before @entity42 was begun			2
@entity113 is the largest in @entity2 , a wedge - shaped burial chamber measuring 106 metres ( 348 feet ) long			2
it is believed to have been open for several centuries before being sealed up			0
@entity117 , near @entity118 , is a late @entity1 long barrow which was found to contain the remains of several people from the same family , ranging in age from 12 months to 60 years			2
@entity124 , near @entity125 , is one of the oldest known barrows in the country , dating back to around 3,200 bc. its two ends have been ploughed away and destroyed , but the remains of one of the @entity136 folk , migrants into @entity2 in 2,500 @entity94 who were notable for the beaker shape of their pottery , have been found in the barrow			0
@entity101 , a vast chalk mound 16 miles ( 26 kilometres ) from @entity42 , is not strictly a barrow but is a man - made mound from the same , @entity1 period and can be seen from many of the barrows that post-date it			2
despite various attempts to excavate it over the years , and despite a common assumption over the years that it must be a burial mound , its purpose is still a mystery			0

' i ’ve been amazed at the response - it ’s a different way to remember someone , and the place is modern and ancient at the same time , ' said @entity107 ( pictured ) @entity11 , who runs a 220 - acre farm , has always had a passion for archaeology and said the idea came out of a ‘ classic pub conversation ’			1
' we were saying would n’t it be nice to get buried in a long barrow and then i was walking round the farm one winter ’s morning and it was misty , very quiet and the sun was just rising , and i thought " i would n’t mind spending eternity here			0
" ' i thought " you could put a long barrow here with the winter sun coming in "			0
the idea all came together very quickly			0
' people have bought niches right from before we had even broken the ground			0
someone from @entity192 has bought a niche , and she ’s very welcome			0
' i ’d love to have this as a meeting place , as so much of the @entity1 was about in @entity22 , with people from all areas coming together			1
' initially the cremated remains of 2,400 people can be stored in 250 niches inside four chambers , though the eventual plan is 350 niches in seven chambers			2
entire families can reserve their own ‘ room ’ in the tomb , which has no religious links although it ’s already attracting pagan worshippers , said @entity11 , a self - confessed atheist stonemason @entity211 described it as ‘ not your usual job and a once in a lifetime opportunity ’			1
he said : ' i quite like archaeology			0
it ’s fascinating to go to @entity42 and see how they managed to construct that			0
' i ’m trying to build it in a way the @entity1 people could have done it in their time			1
' it ’s strange really			0
we have n’t built a long barrow for 5,000 years , but now we ’ve had another enquiry for one			0
' they want a burial chamber built in central @entity231 to hold some art. ' they ’re like buses			0
you do n’t get one for 5,000 years and then all of a sudden two come at once			0

i ’m trying to build it in a way the @entity1 people could have done it in their time ' one person who ’s signed up is @entity251 , 49 , of @entity252 , @entity22 , who said : ' i ’m interested in the alignment of ancient monuments			1
' what appeals to me about having my remains in this long barrow is the permanence of the structure and the landscape			0
' this long barrow is going to baffle archaeologists for ever			0
' the winter solstice will shine down the length of the inernal passageway , with the front of the barrow being made from one - tonne @entity268 stones , the same material used at @entity42 and the @entity125 stone circle near @entity271 , @entity22			1
retired archaeologist @entity272 , from @entity273 , near @entity274 , who worked on the repair of the ancient and mysterious @entity101 and has visited most of the country ’s long barrows , said : ' the facade looks very impressive and the chambers are very good			2
' it ’s not a direct copy of anything @entity1 and i think that ’s quite deliberate			2
it ’s distinctive and modern			2
