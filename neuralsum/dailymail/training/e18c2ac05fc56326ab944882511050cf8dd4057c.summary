by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:40 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 12 april 2013 pioneering : @entity2 , 22 , from @entity3 in @entity4 , was born without a womb a woman who underwent the world ’s first successful womb transplant is pregnant , it was revealed yesterday			1
the success of @entity2 ’s @entity12 fertility treatment could give hope to thousands of childless @entity15 women			1
doctors treating the 22 - year - old said early test results were ‘ consistent with the expected signs of pregnancy ’			1
mrs @entity2 was described as a ‘ medical miracle ’ when she became the first woman in the world to have a successful womb transplant , from a dead donor , in august 2011			1
since then other women have also been given a womb transplant , but mrs @entity2 is the first to become pregnant			1
doctors in @entity29 , @entity4 , waited for 18 months before implanting an embryo into the transplanted womb , to give the pregnancy the greatest possible chance of survival			1
however , mrs @entity2 still faces a high risk of miscarriage and other complications in the early stages of pregnancy			2
there is also a chance of birth defects linked to the immune - suppressing drugs used in transplants			0
mrs @entity2 was born without a womb , a rare condition which affects around one in 5,000 women			2
but her ovaries were healthy and she produced eggs , which doctors harvested before the womb transplant to create embryos fertilised with sperm from her husband @entity53			2
earlier this month at least one fertilised embryo was placed into the new womb by specialists at @entity58 in @entity29			0
any baby would be delivered via caesarean section after eight months , to reduce the chance of premature labour			0
artificial selection : mrs @entity2 had eight embryos frozen before her treatment			0
doctors thawed them before transferring them into her uterus - which she received in 2011 from a dead donor following a birth , doctors would then carry out further surgery to remove the donor womb , to avoid the risk of infection or rejection			0
a successful birth would give hope to the 15,000 women in @entity15 who are born without a womb or who have had hysterectomies			0
a team of @entity15 doctors is hoping to perform the first womb transplants in this country within two years .			0
