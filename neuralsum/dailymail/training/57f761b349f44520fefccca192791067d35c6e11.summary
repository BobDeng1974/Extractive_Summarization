when @entity1 was asked if a contest between @entity3 and @entity4 could ever be called a friendly , he replied : ‘ why not ? ’ he has been at pains to stress his fondness for the @entity7 in the last few days , summoning his father ’s @entity9 roots to somehow support his case			1
with @entity13 , it is not quite the same			1
@entity13 , after all , was on the pitch as a fan when the @entity16 invaded @entity17 in 1977 and on the pitch as a player when @entity20 headed the winner in the rain at @entity23 eight years later			1
@entity1 recalls the painful memory of @entity25 in 1967 , but @entity13 is connected to this fixture			1
when the nations met in the @entity29 play - offs , the last time @entity3 were in @entity30 , he was the manager of @entity31 and stirring mischief , by saying : ‘ the @entity33 stole our land ... the @entity33 robbed us of all our oil ... the @entity33 perpetrated the @entity38 clearances ... and now , the @entity33 have pinched @entity39			1
’ @entity4 skipper @entity40 leads the way during training on monday ahead of clash with the @entity33 @entity13 says his stars are all desperate to play against @entity3 on tuesday @entity45 keeper @entity44 is put through his paces during the session @entity13 joked in 1999 that the @entity33 ' pinched @entity39 ' ( above ) the @entity4 boss updated those remarks for the 21st century on monday as he relaxed amid the roaring fires , stag art and whisky bottles which gave his team ’s hotel base , on the banks of the @entity56 by the @entity58 hills , the feel of a scene from the @entity62 film @entity61			1
it was only a shame the 57 - year - old had opted for the man - made fabrics of modern sportswear as opposed to tweed			2
‘ @entity39 ’s back , we lost him for a while but now he ’s back , ’ quipped @entity13 , on the subject of @entity39 and who has rights to the much - loved comic			1
‘ that was 15 years back			1
did i really say that ? is my lawyer in here ? it was probably tongue - in - cheek , but that ’s the way it went years ago : the @entity83 at one table and the @entity7 at the other			1
’ the clod of turf he took from @entity17 in 1977 has long since been left in the back garden of a home he had in @entity92 , @entity93			2
‘ it was my honeymoon and i spent it in @entity95 , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ i took my wife and my best man to the game			2
unfortunately , his wife could n’t get in			2
we only had three tickets , so she had to stay in the hotel			2
‘ i was n’t one of the first on the pitch			2
i think there were only three of us left standing there and the policeman said : you might as well go on as well , son			2
’ the one - liners are delivered in a flash			2
it is like an audience with @entity117 without the undercurrent of menace			2
@entity13 says he has a selection headache for the game at @entity122 @entity13 oversees training on monday as his players try to stake a claim for a starting spot @entity4 star @entity127 was all smiles following friday night 's win against the @entity130 @entity13 admits the wise - cracking is a defence mechanism which kicks in when the questions turn to subjects he would rather avoid			1
but there ca n’t be many of those when his side are in such rich form			1
@entity4 have lost only once in 10 — a narrow defeat by @entity140 — and are giddy about the upturn after emerging from a period of national soul - searching which accompanied the independence referendum in september			2
when @entity13 went to see the band @entity146 in concert at @entity30 ’s @entity148 on saturday , he found the live acts talking on stage about @entity152 ’s winner against the @entity130 and the crowd abuzz			1
they are not quite ready to relinquish their underdog status to @entity3 — the manager pointing out his team against the @entity159 contained only three players from the @entity161 — but the first home game for 15 years against their oldest rivals could barely have been timed better			1
@entity13 takes a moment to mull over a question from reporters during his press conference @entity13 , pictured here up against @entity169 in 1984 , says the clash was the highlight of his calendar @entity40 shows off his keepy - uppy skills during training as he prepares to lead his troops into battle ‘ nobody wants to be rested , that ’s for sure , ’ said the @entity4 boss , when asked about the strength of his team			1
‘ a wee bit of that is because of the fixture			2
if we were playing some team 70 - odd in the rankings , we would n’t be as excited			0
‘ it was a bit like the first day of pre-season in training			1
we ’ve got so many players who want to play			0
there were a few bumps but it was old - school rub it down and get on with it			0
‘ top players have to play 60 games a season			0
if you want an easy life , go to a mediocre @entity204 club			0
you can get nine weeks ’ break			0
if you want to be a top player , get your mind around playing every week and deal with that			0
’ it was not signposted as a message for @entity211 , but relevant nevertheless			0
@entity13 grabs a word with in - form @entity214 forward @entity213 @entity215 briefs @entity4 's shot - stoppers before the session near @entity30 @entity3 must be fully focused and committed to pass this test in the face of a @entity7 renaissance			1
‘ this is a competitive game , even if there are no points available , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ it was the event of the season in my time , but we never had a lot of live football on the telly back then			0
‘ there are so many big games on now that it dilutes interest			0
but this still has an interest			0
’ this does not mean it will be a ‘ bloodbath ’ , he was quick to add			0
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity239 struck a nerve when he noted the @entity7 and @entity159 had been ‘ kicking lumps out of each other ’ on friday			1
‘ @entity239 does n’t need to worry because he ’s in goals , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ it ’s new to me , all this , we ’re only 5ft 6in			0
on friday , people went toe to toe			0
it was n’t a nasty game			0
i ’d have called it a really good game of football			0
there was a real intensity but no nastiness at all			0
@entity258 juggles with the ball as @entity4 's stars looked relaxed ahead of the friendly fixture @entity258 made light work of the slalom during the training session in @entity265 ‘ the game ’s changed			1
you ca n’t kick lumps out of people anymore			0
there are rules in place			0
a team like @entity267 could n’t have emerged 30 years ago because of the rules and the pitches			1
that ’s why @entity278 and @entity279 are able to flourish			0
‘ you have 22 cameras at every game and you get done retrospectively			0
if somebody elbowed you 30 years ago , you just had to wipe the blood from your face and get on with it			2
‘ that kind of intimidation in football is completely gone			0
’ @entity290 expecting fiery atmosphere in @entity4			0

@entity13 's side looked relaxed during training on monday
@entity7 *boosted* @entity296 qualifying hopes with *vital* win over @entity298
@entity13 is weighing up whether to make changes against the @entity33
said in ' 99 that the @entity33 ' pinched ' @entity39 and laughs 15 years on
