by @entity1 reporter published : 12:39 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:58 est , 24 february 2014 a man who claims to have captured and killed @entity5 after luring it with pork ribs has begun a tour across the south , showing off its corpse			1
@entity10 , who describes himself as ' best @entity11 in the world ' , claims to have shot the beast near @entity14 in @entity15 in september 2012			1
despite releasing various photographs supposedly showing the dead @entity5 , there is a great deal of skepticism over their authenticity			2
mr @entity10 , who is a used car salesman , was previously involved in a @entity5 hoax in 2008 when a ' corpse ' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit			1
he is now on tour with the corpse			0
@entity10 is the same person who staged a @entity5 hoax in 2008 but this time he swears he is not lying on display : @entity10 released this new image , supposedly showing the @entity5 he killed lying dead on the floor of his tent			1
he is now taking the corpse on a cross-country tour is he for real ? @entity10 calls himself a ' @entity39 ' but also knows there are people out there who are going to dispute his claim , and he does n't care raking it in : @entity10 is on a nationwide tour showing off his supposed @entity5 corpse for $ 20 per person the display is now in @entity50 and drew about 800 people to @entity52 in northwest @entity53 on sunday			1
' we got here a day early and we just wanted to show as many people as possible , ' said mr @entity10			2
' @entity5 is not the @entity56			0
' people of all ages shelled out money to enter his trailer to look into the 9 - foot case that holds the specimen @entity10 calls @entity64			2
the body of the creature can be viewed under a glass coffin adorned with camouflaged baseball hats			0
' i 'm not convinced , ' said @entity70 , after taking a look with his wife @entity72 and their three children			0
' i believe the @entity76 footage is authentic because you can see the muscles and everything on there , but this one was kind of different			0
but he did mention that after the autopsy the body kind of changes , ' he said to the @entity85			0
@entity76 is the man who filmed one of the most famous ' sightings ' back in 1967			0
@entity76 died in 1972 , and the man who wore the gorilla suit in the film even admitted it was a hoax , @entity92 was so convinced that she bought a shirt and had @entity10 sign it			2
' it 's amazing when you go inside , you feel different , ' she said			0
' i had never seen anything like this before , only on the @entity99			0
' body of the beast : @entity10 claims that this is a photo of legendary creature @entity5 , which he shot near @entity14 18 months ago mr @entity10 claims that he lured the 800 pound beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from @entity106 to a tree in @entity14 , @entity15 in september 2012			1
he initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature 's face , but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent			2
speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill , 36 - year - old @entity10 said he did n't regret his 2008 hoax , as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full - time @entity5 operations ever since			1
he claims that without the previous publicity stunt , he would never have been able to ' really capture ' a @entity5			2
' i have 13 months with it , ' @entity10 said last month			0
' then it will probably go into a museum as the first @entity5 ever killed			2
' on the @entity127 : @entity10 says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at @entity106 to a tree			1
while the creature was eating , mr @entity10 allegedly shot it speaking of the moment he killed the beast , he said : ' i nailed ... pork ribs from the @entity106 down the street to the side of the tree , and lo and behold , he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree			1
' mr @entity10 claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and ' with tears in my eyes ' shot it dead			1
the excitement surrounding mr @entity10 's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a @entity5 hoax back in 2008			1
back then , as now , he claimed he had the body of @entity5			2
but the @entity152 reported that , once the frozen body began to thaw , the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit			1
this time mr @entity10 is adamant that his @entity5 is ' for real '			2
he said : ' from dna tests to 3d optical scans to body scans			1
it is the real deal			0
it 's @entity5 and @entity5 's here , and i shot it and now i 'm proving it to the world			0
' video by @entity10 committed hunter : mr @entity10 is a self - proclaimed ' real ' @entity5 tracker , although he is a used car salesman in his spare time ' there was a hoax in 2008 , ' he said			1
' it did n’t start out as a hoax and that ’s what people do n’t understand			0
this is about redeeming myself			0
i do n’t want to go down as a hoaxer			0
i want to go down as the best @entity11 in the world			0
' however , mr @entity10 has yet to produce the results of the dna tests and optical scans			1
bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world , but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive			0
his tour has so far been traveling across @entity15 and will visit @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 over the coming @entity190 costs $ 20			1
@entity192 face : what appears to be a large humanoid creature scowls at the camera in this grainy still from video footage			0
