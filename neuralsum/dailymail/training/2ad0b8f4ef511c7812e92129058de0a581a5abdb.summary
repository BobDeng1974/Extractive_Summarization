by @entity0 @entity1 were handed a harsh reminder of the realities of life in the second tier as goals from @entity7 and @entity8 gave @entity9 a comfortable opening day win			1
@entity11 fielded a side unrecognisable from the one that suffered relegation from the @entity17 last season , with captain @entity18 joined by five academy graduates and five new signings , including £ 11m man @entity21			2
but they will need some time to gel and defensive frailties were exposed here by an @entity9 side who might be an outside bet for the play - off places			2
goals : @entity7 32 , @entity8 61			1
booked : @entity51 , @entity37 @entity1 : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 74 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity8 ( @entity59 46 ) , @entity18 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity21 ( @entity62 57 )			1
subs : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , burn			0
goal : @entity69 referee : @entity71 attendance : 17 , 218 @entity18 is usually mr @entity72 in the heart of midfield , but he was stripped of possession by @entity76 just after the half - hour mark			0
@entity39 slipped @entity7 through the right - hand channel and he breezed past the lightweight @entity54 before finishing low past @entity52			1
and @entity54 was exposed again when he only half - cleared a cross by @entity7 on the hour , the ball falling perfectly for @entity82 favourite @entity8 , making his first appearance since february , to crash home from outside the box			1
@entity9 were excellent value for their lead though they were forced to cling on after @entity1 ’s @entity88 pulled one back with a deflected effort four minutes from time that beat @entity91 at his near post			1
a @entity1 equaliser would have been undeserved , though @entity11 know it will take time to readjust to life in the championship after 13 years at a higher level , especially with such an altered team			0
slow start : @entity21 failed to have any real impact as @entity1 fell to a defeat in their opening game his was a bold selection , with great faith shown in the stars of @entity1 ’s run to the @entity108 final last season			1
@entity52 , @entity61 , @entity60 and @entity55 were among those named in the squad			0
@entity59 , the 21 - year - old @entity112 talent signed from @entity113 , was named on the bench			0
@entity52 , was called into action early on when he pushed @entity35 ’s goalbound header over the bar after @entity37 had delivered well from the left			0
@entity1 had a golden chance to take the lead when @entity91 spilt a @entity8 shot at the feet of @entity61 , his rebound blocked by the relieved keeper			1
and they would rue that miss when @entity7 opened the scoring just after the half - hour , to the delight of the 17,000 - plus crowd enjoying the return of regular football on a gloriously sunny august afternoon			2
work to do : there is plenty to think about for @entity11 and his @entity1 team , who need to adapt to this level @entity21 endured a frustrating start to his @entity1 career and was replaced before the hour by @entity62			1
he had barely had a sniff , marked out of the game by the @entity9 defenders			0
@entity11 afterwards admitted his expensive acquisition was some was short of the required match fitness			0
almost immediately , @entity9 doubled their lead and the stuffing looked to have been knocked out of @entity1			2
to their credit , they rallied , improving massively after the introduction of @entity146 , who cut inside from the right to good effect			0
but it was @entity69 , the right - back brought in from @entity151 over the summer , who actually made that tactic work to set up a grandstand finale .			0

@entity7 bursts past @entity54 to put @entity9 ahead
@entity8 doubles the *advantage* in second half
new signing @entity21 substituted after 57 minutes after poor debut
@entity88 pulls one back for @entity1 with *individual* effort
