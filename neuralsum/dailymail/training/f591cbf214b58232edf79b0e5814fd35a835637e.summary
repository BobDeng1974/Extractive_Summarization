by @entity0 published : 14:12 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 05:15 est , 23 december 2012 the @entity1 has pardoned his butler for stealing and leaking documents that alleged corruption in the @entity5			2
pope @entity6 made a surprise pre-christmas visit to the jail holding @entity9 , before the butler was allowed to return to his family			1
the pope and former butler spent about 15 minutes together before @entity9 was freed and allowed to go home to his family in their @entity5 apartment , a @entity5 spokesman said			1
@entity9 , 46 , was convicted of aggravated theft on october 6 in a case that shone unwelcome publicity on the @entity5 and had been serving an 18 - month sentence in a jail cell in the city state 's police headquarters			1
pope @entity6 talks with former butler @entity9 during a private audience at the @entity5 , and pardons him ' this was a paternal gesture towards a person with whom the pope shared his daily life for several years , ' father @entity26 , a spokesman , said			1
' this is a happy ending in this @entity34 season , ' he said			0
@entity9 was arrested in may after @entity5 police found many documents in his possession that had been stolen from the pope 's office			1
the former butler gave them to the media in what mushroomed into an embarrassing scandal for @entity6 's pontificate that became known as ' @entity9 '			2
@entity9 told investigators he had leaked the documents because he saw ' evil and corruption everywhere in the @entity49 ' and that information was being hidden from the pope			2
@entity9 told the court that convicted him at the trial - one of the most sensational in the recent history of the @entity5 - that he did not consider himself a thief and that he had done what he did out of ' visceral ' love for the @entity49			0
the former butler ( right ) was found guilty of stealing and copying the @entity1 's documents and leaking them to an @entity61 journalist in one of the most dramatic betrayals of trust in @entity5 history , @entity9 , who served the pope his meals and helped him dress , photocopied sensitive documents under the nose of his immediate superiors in a small office adjacent to the papal living quarters in the @entity75			2
he then hid more than 1,000 copies and original documents , including some the pope had marked ' to be destroyed , ' among many thousands of other papers and old newspaper clippings in a huge armoire in the family apartment inside the @entity5 walls			0
a former member of the small , select group known as ' the papal family ' , @entity9 was one of fewer than 10 people who had a key to an elevator leading directly to the pope 's apartments			0
he said during the trial that from his perch as papal butler he was able to see how easily a powerful man could be manipulated by aides and kept in the dark about things he should have known			0
in the course of the trial , intimate details emerged of the inner workings of an institution long renowned for its secrecy			0
the documents @entity9 leaked triggered one of the biggest crises of pope @entity6 's papacy when they emerged in a muckraking expose by an @entity61 journalist earlier this year			1
the case was all the more embarrassing for the @entity5 because it came at a time when it was trying to limit the reputational fallout from a series of scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by clerics around the world as well as from mismanagement at its bank			0
the @entity5 said the pope had also pardoned a second @entity5 employee , @entity122 , who was convicted in a separate trial of helping @entity9 and given a two month suspended sentence			1
@entity9 will no longer be able to work in the @entity5 but will be helped to find a job and start a new life outside its walls together with his family , the @entity5 said .			0
