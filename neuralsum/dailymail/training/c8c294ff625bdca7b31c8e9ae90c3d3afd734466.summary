by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 03:40 est , 11 april 2012 the wife of a senior @entity3 official could face the death penalty if convicted of the murder of murder of a @entity8 businessman after being named prime suspect in the case			0
@entity11 , the wife @entity12 chief @entity14 , is being held on suspicion of killing @entity15 , who died in the city last november			1
@entity14 has himself been suspended from the party 's 25 - member @entity18 on suspicion of involvement in ' serious discipline violations '			1
suspicious death ? @entity11 ( left ) , the wife of fallen @entity24 city leader @entity14 , has been accused of playing a part in the death of @entity8 businessman @entity15 ( right ) , who had close links to the family the @entity24 government said a fresh investigation into the murder is under way , and named @entity11 , mr @entity14 's 53 - year - old second wife , and @entity34 , ' an orderly at @entity14 's home ' as suspects			1
the pair have been ' transferred to judicial authorities on suspected crime of intentional homicide '			0
the maximum penalty for murder in @entity24 is death			0
@entity14 is the most senior leader to be suspended from the @entity18 since @entity45 's party chief was removed for corruption six years ago			1
the announcements provide details on what has been a lurid , divisive and embarrassing affair for the @entity24 's leadership			0
the scandal has brought political infighting out of the usually closed confines of elite party politics and into public view			0
the brief announcement about @entity14 's suspension did not elaborate on what rules he is suspected of violated			1
however , the charge is broad enough to cover everything from corruption to the mishandling of internal party affairs			0
initial reports from @entity24 officials told that mr @entity15 , a 41 - year - old @entity8 businessman , died in @entity67 last november from excess alcohol			1
but , in a startling and almost unprecedented leak , a senior police chief cast doubt on the official cause of death by claiming the father - of - two may have been poisoned			1
purged : allegations that the wife of @entity67 leader @entity14 ( above ) may have been behind mr @entity15 's death given an insight into events that forced him from office countless rumours and speculation , fuelled by @entity24 online whistleblowers , suggested his death was linked to his professional relationship with @entity14			1
in startling claims , the city 's former police chief , @entity86 , is said to have told @entity14 he believed his wife @entity11 was involved in mr @entity15 's death in the southwestern @entity24 city , according to a @entity93 source			1
it has also been alleged that a new report reveals how mr @entity15 told friends he feared for his safety after falling out with @entity11 , according to the @entity98			1
claims that she may have been behind his death were the first direct account of events which eventually led to mr @entity14 's downfall last month			1
mr @entity14 recently made a very public bid for a place in the party 's inner circle when new members are installed later this year			2
a source , citing accounts coming from an unfinished central investigation , said it was unclear how much truth there was to the claim by @entity86			0
but he said had ' no doubt ' that @entity86 had raised it with @entity14			2
the account helps explain the apparent rupture between the city chief and @entity86 , who led @entity14 's widely applauded crackdown on crime in @entity24 's most populous metropolis			1
in early february , mr @entity86 briefly sought refuge in the @entity125 consulate in @entity126 , several hours ' drive from @entity67 , which suddenly made the growing scandal public			2
power : @entity24 paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the @entity3 provincial head office in @entity67 which was the office of @entity14 mr @entity14 , 62 , and his wife had disappeared from public view since his abrupt removal on march 15 as party chief of @entity67			1
@entity11 was already believed to be under arrest , according to @entity139			2
they can not respond publicly to the rumours and reports , nor can @entity86 , who is under investigation			0
the @entity67 government has not answered repeated phone calls and faxed questions from @entity93 about the circumstances of @entity14 's downfall and mr @entity15 's death			1
the central government has said the results of its investigation into @entity86 's flight to the consulate will be released , but to date it has not offered a detailed account			0
the @entity156 has also not answered questions about @entity15 , with a spokesman saying that he had no information			2
in a news conference days before his dismissal , @entity14 scorned as nonsense unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said some people were pouring ' filth on my family '			2
@entity11 was formerly a high - powered lawyer			2
' @entity86 has told central investigators that @entity11 turned on the @entity8 man because of economic interests and that she wanted to destroy him ( @entity15 ) , ' said the source , who is generally sympathetic to @entity14			1
@entity174 and @entity175 - based relatives of @entity15 told @entity93 in separate interviews that they did not suspect foul play in his death			2
they both spoke on condition of anonymity			0
favours : mr @entity15 is said to have helped the @entity183 ' secure top @entity8 public school berths for their son , @entity184 , centre access : mr @entity14 's son @entity188 , seen here on the right with action movie star @entity191 , left , won places at @entity193 and @entity194 ' it 's preposterous			1
the more description ( in the media ) , the darker it becomes , ' the family member said , occasionally breaking into tears in an interview in the lobby lounge of a hotel on the outskirts of @entity174 late on thursday			0
the family denied reports that @entity15 was a spy and that he was cremated against their wishes			2
' we requested the cremation			0
we were not forced to do so			0
we have no doubts about the police report , ' said one family member			0
dismissed @entity67 party chief @entity14 had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among @entity24 's elite			1
but now a very different picture of his mafia - busting initiative — called da hei , or smash black — is emerging , since mr. @entity14 was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief @entity86			1
critics called his clampdown , launched in 2009 , the ' red terror ' , saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity : framing victims , extracting confessions through torture , extorting business empires and visiting retribution on mr @entity14 's political rivals			1
@entity234 , an analyst of the @entity24 leadership at the @entity236 , told the @entity237 : ‘ even by @entity3 standards , this is unacceptable			0
’ he added : ‘ this is red terror			0
’ in 10 months , 4,781 people were arrested , including business executives , police officers , judges , legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates , according to the @entity237			0
@entity67 ’s top justice official was even found to have buried $ 3 million under a fish pond , during the crackdown			0
he became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed			0
but mr @entity14 's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer , police chief @entity86 last month sought refuge in a @entity125 consulate			1
he apparently feared for his safety after telling mr @entity14 that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a @entity8 citizen , @entity15 , who was an acquaintance of mr @entity14 ’s family			1
the @entity262 in @entity174 has asked the @entity24 government to reinvestigate his death , attributed by @entity67 police to cardiac arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol			2
@entity15 married @entity24 national @entity269 after moving to the country and they had two children , @entity273 , 11 , and son @entity274 , 7			0
he was not a heavy drinker , but was a chain smoker			0
his father , @entity274 , also died of a heart attack after drinks over dinner at his @entity175 home in 2004 at age 63 , the family members said			0
it is understood mr @entity15 helped arrange business meetings with mr @entity14 when he was a government minister in the @entity286 in the capital , @entity174			1
it is also claimed mr @entity15 helped the @entity183 secure top @entity8 public school berths for their son , @entity184 , who studied at @entity193 and @entity194 , though this can not be confirmed			1
the source said that according to @entity86 , @entity11 believed @entity15 had abused or taken @entity14 family funds to which the @entity294 might have had access			1
@entity15 's family members said he had no business dealings with the @entity183			2
the source 's account of @entity86 's accusations tallies with details that have emerged about the drama that unfolded before he took flight to the @entity125 consulate in @entity126 , where he stayed for 24 hours before officials coaxed him out			0
the emerging accounts help explain why central leaders decided to risk the aftershocks triggered by unseating @entity14 , an ex-commerce minister known both for revolutionary style populism and for his courting of multinationals			0
by the time @entity86 arrived at the @entity125 consulate , his relationship with his long - time patron , @entity14 , had already curdled into mutual distrust , said the source			2
according to the source and previous accounts reported by @entity93 , @entity86 feared that @entity14 , eager to preserve his reputation and chances for a spot in the next central leadership , could turn on him after central party investigators began probing @entity86 's past			2
about a week before his flight to the consulate , @entity86 told @entity14 about his suspicions about the death of @entity15 , a business consultant who was instrumental in @entity14 's son attending @entity193 , an exclusive private school in @entity330			1
@entity15 knew the @entity14 family from the time when he lived in @entity24 's northeastern port city of @entity334 , where @entity14 was mayor from 1993 to 2000			1
' ( @entity86 ) told @entity14 that the problem could n't be covered up , ' said the source			2
@entity14 was outraged , said the source , who has met both men			0
days later , @entity14 demoted @entity86 to the much less powerful role of vice mayor for education , culture and science			0
@entity14 initially tried to muffle the allegations , but the former police chief 's flight to the consulate brought the rupture between the men into the open , said the source			1
even if @entity86 's suspicions over @entity15 's death prove unfounded , @entity14 's initial failure to report the case could end his political career , said the source			1
' in the central leadership 's view , that was too late			0
they said he should have reported the problem as soon as @entity86 raised allegations about @entity11			0

officials initially said fixer @entity15 died of excess alcohol
but police chief now fears that @entity371 schoolboy was poisoned
mr @entity15 had close ties to purged @entity67 leader @entity14
told friends he feared for his safety after fall - out with @entity14 's wife , @entity11
