the dramatic moment that @entity3 's @entity2 comet lander bounced back into space has been captured in a remarkable image			1
@entity2 successfully landed on comet @entity6 in november , but not before a failure to launch its harpoons and a thruster caused it to bounce twice before settling			1
the blurry image captures the rapid motion in which @entity2 was bounced back			1
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) before coming to rest			1
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) before coming to rest scientists described the comet 's ground as being more like a ' trampoline ' than rock , owing to its soft and powdery texture , which may have caused the unsteady landing of the probe			1
the image was taken by @entity2 's @entity33 camera , which was designed to capture the moment the probe settled on the surface			1
' that image was a shock because obviously we were not still - we were moving , ' co-principal investigator @entity37 told @entity41 at the @entity42			0
' it demonstrated together with [ other data ] that we were not on the comet			0
the team suffered an agonising wait before telemetry revealed whether the bounce velocity was high enough for the probe to escape the comet 's weak gravity			1

the probe landed on the comet at around 3.30pm gmt on the 12th of november but then bounced twice - first to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) before coming to rest			1
it is currently thought to be about 0.62 miles ( 1km ) from its intended landing site professor @entity37 also revealed a reprocessed @entity33 image taken by @entity2 at the @entity85 's @entity84 in @entity86			1
the image , named ' @entity66 ' , depicts one of the walls looming over the robot , with reflections from @entity2 shown by glare marks			1
the @entity3 probe , which was carrying @entity2 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity95 and @entity96 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity98			1
it chased comet @entity100 – @entity101 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity2 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			0
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			1
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity95 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			0
@entity33 took sharper images of the @entity135 's terrain , but these were taken after the probe had fallen into a dark ditch , unable to get the sunlight it needed to recharge its batteries			2
another image shows a reconstruction a model of @entity2 's final landing location			1
@entity3 engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as march next year , as comet @entity135 gets closer to the sun. the probe is currently only receiving around an hour of sunlight during the comet 's 12 - hour day , with its batteries frozen in temperatures of -170 ° @entity155 in a recent @entity158 ' ask me anything ' session , engineers at mission control said : ' we expect to have enough energy to boot around march next year			1
' then @entity2 needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery			2
the batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels , but because @entity2 hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown , it ended up in shadow			2
' it is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in @entity177 just below the @entity178 during the winter , ' said @entity180 , @entity2 systems engineer			2
but despite the probe losing power earlier than expected , @entity2 and the @entity3 spacecraft have already made a number of important discoveries			2
last week , @entity3 found water around the comet calling into question a leading theory about how the @entity95 got its oceans			0
the finding suggests that rocky asteroids rather than icy comets may have been chiefly responsible for bringing water to @entity95 early in its history			0
unlike the @entity95 's oceans , the vapour largely consists of water with a different atomic flavour containing deuterium , the ' heavy ' isotope of hydrogen			0
the amount of deuterium compared with normal hydrogen in the comet 's water is three times greater than it is in water on @entity95			0
this suggests that so - called @entity212 - family comets , such as @entity135 , can not be assumed to have created the oceans on @entity95			0
in contrast , meteorites falling on @entity95 that originate from the asteroid belt between @entity96 and @entity212 tend to match the composition of @entity95 ocean water			0
rough ride : the @entity221 camera on the @entity3 orbiter took a number images of @entity2 as it descended toward its touchdown on the comet on november 12			2
images showthe spacecraft rotating , and evidence of the lander 's touchdown on the comet surface			0
one final image , captured 9 minutes after the landing , sees the spacecraft bright against the comet 's surface true colours : the @entity237 in @entity238 has revealed the true colour of @entity135 ( left )			2
the image reveals what the comet would look like to the human eye			0
on the right is an image taken taken by a @entity3 instrument dubbed @entity221 bumpy ride : ahead of the landing , @entity3 took a number of images of @entity2 during its daring descent			2
this view shows the lander 's consert antennae deployed			2
it also shows three lander feet and the @entity258 descent camera boom major discovery : scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity95 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			0
pictured is an artist 's impression of the @entity3 spacecraft orbiting comet @entity135			0

in november , failure to launch @entity2 's harpoons and a thruster caused it to bounce twice before settling
a new blurry image by @entity280 captures the rapid motion in which @entity2 was launched back out into space
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres )
@entity280 has also released an reconstruction of its resting place , and a view of the cliff wall looming over the probe
