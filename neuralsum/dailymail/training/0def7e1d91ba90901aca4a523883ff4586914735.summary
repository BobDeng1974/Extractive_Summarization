@entity1 sporting director @entity0 is adamant the team has the funds to see out the season and are doing all they can to ensure they will be on the grid in 2015			1
speculation emerged over the course of the @entity8 that due to financial difficulties the @entity10 - based marque almost failed to make it onto the grid at the previous race in @entity15			1
that is a rumour @entity0 vehemently denies , and whilst conceding times are hard , they are nowhere near as black a picture as being painted by some			1
speaking to @entity21 , @entity0 said : ' we have an obligation to trade correctly , and if you do n't reasonably believe you can do that , you have to stop			1
' is it plain sailing , navigating a company through an industry that has the cost structure of @entity32 ? no. @entity1 sporting director @entity0 says his team is going nowhere amid rumours of financial strife ' but if we did n't think we could be here , then we would n't be here			1
' you do n't want to give the wrong impression by glibly saying " yes , we 're fine " because it 's always a challenge operating businesses in this environment			0
' i can say that , yes , we have the funds for this season			0
if we did n't , we should n't be here			0
' @entity1 have been linked to @entity45 , the @entity46 fashion industry billionaire who is understood to have spoken with @entity47 with regard to investment , only for talks to falter			2
@entity0 declined to comment on @entity51 , although at present it is understood no discussions have yet taken place with the team 's majority shareholder @entity55			1
as for 2015 , and with gossip rife @entity32 could be reduced to eight teams fielding three cars as three teams face going to the wall over the winter , @entity0 maintains @entity1 are working tooth and nail to be on the grid for the opening race in @entity68 in march			1
@entity1 driver @entity69 , of @entity70 , in action before failing to complete the @entity72 @entity8 ' nobody can state unequivocally they will be racing next season			1
not a single person in this pit lane can do that , ' said @entity0			2
' look at @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 who all pulled out at the drop of a hat			0
they were companies who had finances to be in this sport , but chose not to			0
' if it makes sense then people will be there , as simple as that			0
' the people involved in @entity32 are not crazy			2
we see long - term value in what we are trying to do , what we are trying to build			0
' obviously there are plenty of easier things in the world to do , and there are certainly easier ways to make money , that 's absolutely for sure			0
' but we believe in the long - term value of @entity32			2
we 've said this a number of times , the biggest asset @entity32 has to be its fanbase			2
@entity70 's @entity69 , with girlfriend @entity111 , faces an uncertain future with a cloud of @entity1 ' it 's enormous , unique , and is incredibly valuable , so that itself is sufficient for a team like us to build for the long term			1
' but that also means there can be difficult times along the way			0
' @entity0 can at least confirm @entity1 are currently in the process of building their car for 2015 , claiming it is ' moving along at speed '			1
@entity0 added : ' we 're quite happy with the progress we 're seeing			2
' we 're doing what any team could , would , should be doing at this stage			0
' the bottom line is : times are tough , but we 're still here , still on the grid , still fighting , and at this stage we 're doing everything to be on the grid in 2015			0
