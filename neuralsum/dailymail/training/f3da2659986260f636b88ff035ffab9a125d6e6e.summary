by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 15:00 est , 26 march 2012 a former hedge fund boss is taking the biggest gamble of his life by opening the country ’s newest and largest vineyard – with plans to produce one million bottles of fizz a year			1
@entity9 , 47 , and a team of 30 , will attempt to take on the @entity11 at their own game , producing quality sparkling wine to rival the best @entity15 has to offer			1
his picturesque 400 - acre plot , nestled on a south - facing slope , near the coast at @entity19 , @entity20 , is just 88 miles as the crow flies from @entity15 in @entity11 , and has a very similar soil and climate			1
the @entity24 will be one of the largest single site vineyards in @entity27 and aims to capitalise on the booming demand - both nationally and internationally - for high quality @entity29 sparkling wine			1
scroll down to see the first vines being planted ready for action : @entity9 , pictured with his wife @entity33 , on the freshly - ploughed @entity35 vineyard some fizz in @entity37 ? the @entity24 in @entity35 is only 88 miles from @entity15 in @entity11 , and is said to have similar growing conditions a taste of things to come : grape - pickers work in the @entity43 's vineyards in @entity45 - @entity44 @entity46 currently produces only four million bottles of wine each year - which is actually less than we consume each day			1
mr @entity9 , father - of - four , said : ' a lot of people do n’t realise that @entity29 wine producers are making some of the best sparkling wine in the world			1
@entity55 , another local @entity37 producer , won the prestigious @entity58 award in 2010 for its sparkling wine , the first time the award has been won outside of @entity11			1
' so , we know it can be done			2
we hope that opening such a large operation will help put @entity29 wine on the map			2
' i want @entity68 to be sold not just in the best restaurants in @entity70 , but in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 as well , ’ he said			2
he said that his aim was to produce sparkling wine that compared favourably with the likes of @entity78 and @entity79 , with a retail price of around £ 25 to £ 26			1
he said they would be using the same methods and grapes as they do in @entity15 , so the wine should be similar , although a touch fruitier			2
mr @entity9 , whose usual dress as a stockbroker and then co-manager of a hedge fund , was a suit and tie , now finds he spends a lot of time traipsing about in wellies on his 400 acre site , which he bought in october 2010			1
his ambitious plans are even more astounding , considering that he is in the middle of a degree – in wine - making			1
' i was lucky enough to be able to step down from my job and venture into something new			2
i ’ve always been interested in wine , i ’ve drunk a lot of it over the years , and i have a small , but growing , collection			2
it was from a personal interest that i decided to consider the idea of a vineyard ' the other students find it very amusing that i am opening up the largest vineyard in the country , when i have n’t even finished my studies , ’ said mr @entity9			2
' however , i think they believe it is great news for the industry and for them as i may be employing some of them in the future			2
’ mr @entity9 said that he had n’t anticipated buying land until after his degree at @entity123 , but when the @entity68 estate came up for sale the opportunity was too good to @entity127 ' we were originally looking for a 250 acre site , because we wanted the vineyard to be commercially viable , not just a hobby , so we needed a large plot of land			2
when this farm came up , we jumped at it			2
' we were incredibly lucky , as sites like this do not come up for sale very often in this part of the world , ’ said mr @entity9 , who is employing 30 people full - time and will need up to 200 seasonal workers to help pick the grapes			1
vision : this ruined farmhouse will be restored to its former glory and used as accommodation for workers when they come to pick the grapes mists and mellow fruitfulness : mr @entity9 said the chance to buy the @entity68 estate was too good an opportunity to miss the planting of the four varieties of grapes - @entity155 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 – started this week			1
around 50 acres of grapes will be planted a year until 2020 , when the full 400 acres will be under vine			2
the first still wine could appear as early as next year , with sparkling hitting the shelves in 2016 or 2017			2
' we will produce small amounts of still wine , but this is going to be a predominately sparkling wine vineyard			1
high quality sussex sparkling wine requires at least three years of bottle fermentation , so everyone will have to be patient while they wait , ' said mr @entity9			1
to help him with the wine production , @entity173 , estate manager at @entity68 , moved 12,000 miles from @entity175 to be part of the ambitious project			1
' you could n’t really ask for a better location than this for growing sparkling wine grapes			0
the soil , the climate , the geography - they are all perfect , ’ he said			1
a state - of - the - art winery will be completed by the summer of 2013			1
a staff hostel is also being built to accommodate seasonal workers , who will be needed during harvest and during the winter to maintain the vines			0
the hostel , which uses reclaimed old flint barns , is due to be completed in time for the winter of next year			0
@entity68 has also hired @entity195 , a renowned @entity11 winemaker , who has spent the last ten years working in @entity196 , to oversee the design and construction of the new winery as well as make all of the wines			0
joining @entity9 and @entity201 on the project are @entity173 from @entity175 as vineyard manager and @entity11 @entity204 , winemaker ' the soil , the climate , the geography - they are all perfect , says estate manager @entity173 working with @entity46 and the @entity210 , a programme of improvements is being made to enhance the local natural habitat while reviving and reclaiming the natural chalk grass downland and creating wildlife corridors to improve biodiversity			1
a new walk , the @entity218 , is being established , allowing the public access to parts of the @entity221			0
one of @entity68 ’s aims is to provide a sustainable built infrastructure to support the vineyard			0
buildings feature locally - sourced oak and flint			1
a renewable energy strategy is being implemented based on photovoltaic cells so that each building is energy self - sufficient			1
ground water is being sourced from the @entity24 ’s own bore hole , purified to removed calcium and microbes			0
can we compare ? the vineyards of @entity238 , in the @entity239 of @entity11 are about to face competition from @entity29 sparkling wine channelling the @entity11 flavour : around 50 acres of grapes will be planted a year until 2020 , leading to 400 acres of growing goodness @entity19 is already known for a wine heritage : the @entity246 is also based there the waste water used within the wine making process will be treated on site and released back onto the land			0
new windbreaks using indigenous hedge plants and trees are being grown to manage the micro-conditions on the slopes of the vineyard			1
@entity68 is also funding the construction of a new @entity259 at @entity123 , part of @entity261 , to support the development of skills that the @entity29 wine industry will require as it grows			0
mr @entity9 said : ' the @entity68 project is not just about making wine : we are committed to supporting the wider ambitions of the @entity29 wine industry and that means nurturing the skills it requires to fulfill its potential			1
' you ’ll find that every major wine area is supported by a research centre , which is why i was so keen to invest in one at @entity277			0
we will need skilled workers in this area as the industry takes off			0
' i do believe we are at the beginning of an emerging industry in southern @entity29 and i know the local people here are very supportive of what we are trying to do			0
we have also had encouragement from other local wine producers too			0
all we need to do is convince people in @entity70 and across the country to buy @entity29			0
’ as for the winemakers across the @entity292 , they are ' intrigued ’ to see what we are doing here , said mr @entity9			0
' several @entity11 vineyard owners are trying to purchase or rent land here because it is much cheaper than in @entity15			0
’ now , all there is to do for @entity9 and his wife @entity33 , is to watch the grapes grow and cross their fingers for some good weather			0
so , as a former stockbroker and hedge fund manager , how risky is this venture ? ' of course , we have done a lot of research , we know the land is perfect for sparkling wine , we ’ve brought in some experts to help , and we ’re feeling very confident			1
but of course , the one thing we ca n’t control is the vagaries of the @entity29 weather , ’ he said			0
@entity37 : achingly trendy coastal city @entity261 and @entity35 , @entity46 ’s newest national park , stretching from @entity319 to @entity320 in @entity321 @entity15 : @entity322 is one of the finest medieval cathedrals in @entity11 and is a @entity325 - and even better it is just 45 minutes from @entity71 on the high speed tgv train			1
@entity37 : @entity19 , a quaint village , is also the home of former prime minister @entity330 , and where @entity68 will eventually have a wine tasting shop and heritage centre @entity15 : the @entity334 was created in 1976 , and is a favourite of walkers and climbers , with magnificent views of vines and @entity340 in the distance			0
@entity37 : the tourist board lists 13 vineyards and wine estates in the county @entity15 : there are more than 15,000 wine - makers and around 100 @entity348 in the region			1
@entity37 : nearby @entity350 holds the record for the sunniest place in the @entity353			0
@entity15 : usually winters are cold and clear and summers are warm and dry			0
@entity37 : @entity357 , in @entity356 , won @entity358 in the @entity359 at the @entity360 , for its 2006 @entity361			0
@entity15 : @entity362 produces a staggering 24 million bottles a year and was established by @entity364 in 1743			0
@entity37 : try @entity365 , an ale brewery in the historic town of @entity367			0
@entity15 : try another speciality of the region the @entity370 , which is often used to dip in @entity15 or traditionally red wine			0
it ’s distinguishing feature ? it does n’t disintegrate .			0
