@entity2 looked to the floor as the jury returned their verdict , dismissing her suggestion that @entity23 car enthusiast @entity3 ’s death was ' a tragic accident '			1
the jury of six men and six women found @entity3 guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and not guilty of mr @entity3 ’s murder			1
the 49 - year - old was said to have flown into a rage after her ' quiet ' husband did not immediately stop tending to the garden and return inside their cottage in the village of @entity39 , @entity40 , in @entity41 to tidy up			1
the couple were expecting guests for sunday lunch and @entity3 had asked her husband for help , but he had apparently told her to ' shut up '			2
@entity47 heard the fatal wound was caused by dress - making scissors , which were embedded up to 4in ( 12cm ) into mr @entity3 ’s chest , having first pierced two layers of clothing before puncturing his heart and a lung			1
the mother - of - five told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband , but later changed her account , saying he had walked into the line of fire			2
finally , she told the jury she was unable to recall whether or not she let the scissors go from her hand			2
@entity3 had a history of violence against her former partners and children , and her eldest son told the court she would go into a ' rage ' when the ' red mist ' descended			1
she had hysterically begged medics to save her 48 - year - old husband , but he was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital , around midday on may 13 this year			0
' purely fanciful ' : the mother - of - five told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband , but later changed her account , saying he had walked into them by accident @entity3 had denied murder , and judge @entity81 asked the jury to consider a second charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility or lack of control			1
sentencing @entity3 , he said : ' you have been convicted by the jury of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
' your principal defence of an accident was nothing more than purely fanciful			0
' the jury were satisfied that you were suffering from a personality disorder at the time you killed and it was that personality disorder that affected your ability to exercise self - control			2
' it has been a regular feature during your life			0
the evidence established beyond doubt you have been aggressive , abusive and violent towards previous partners as well as your children			2
' you stabbed a previous partner with a carving knife and assaulted your children on a regular basis			0
' he ( mr @entity3 ) was a meek , mild - mannered and gentle man , who simply took what you handed out			1
' this time , when your temper exploded , you killed somebody : your husband			0
' i have no doubt on that evidence that you intended to hurt him badly and you embedded scissors in his heart and immediately after you regretted your actions			1
' the sentence i will pass upon you is that of nine years ’ imprisonment			0
' judge @entity81 told @entity3 that while in prison she would have to undertake work to deal with her violence and lack of self - control			1
prosecutor @entity133 said @entity3 had not thrown the scissors , but had stabbed her husband of nearly three years as she lost her temper			1
after @entity3 showed the jury how she thought she had thrown the shears on that fatal morning six months ago , mr @entity138 said : ' you ’re searching for the acceptable demonstration of a throw			1
' but as you did n’t throw the scissors , you have no set picture in your head			0
that ’s why your demonstration ( to police and in court ) wobbles and varies so much			0
' lethal : @entity47 heard the fatal wound was caused by dress - making scissors ( not pictured ) , which were embedded up to 4in ( 12cm ) into mr @entity3 's chest giving evidence , @entity3 replied : ' i ’m just not 100 % sure how i picked them ( the scissors ) up			1
it happened in a split - second			0
' she said she stopped herself from picking up the sewing machine - a recent gift from her husband - but just ' grabbed the scissors ' instead			2
experts told the jury that severe force would have been required for the blades to pierce two layers of mr @entity3 ’s clothing before imbedding so deeply into his chest			1
but @entity3 said she had never intended to seriously injure the ' kind , gentle ' mr @entity3 , described by friends as a quiet man who was known locally for his charity work			2
asked by defence counsel @entity178 about how she treated her late husband , @entity3 replied : ' not that well			2
' she broke down upon recalling how mr @entity3 - who the defendant ’s children said would often simply walk away from confrontation - would aim to defuse arguments by putting his arms around hers			1
she said : ' if i was shouting at him , he would put his arms around both my arms			0
he would usually give me a kiss and i would calm down			0
' guilty : @entity3 was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , but cleared of murder at @entity47 ( above ) @entity3 ’s temper frequently got the better of her throughout her life , the court heard			1

the court was told @entity3 had also stabbed her second husband , @entity215 , with a kitchen knife , requiring him to undergo major surgery and spend three weeks in hospital , following a spat in 1989			2
other witnesses recalled how @entity3 had bit a neighbour ’s hand during an argument , while @entity3 herself admitted driving her car at a teenage man she suspected was a bad influence on one of her children			1
it prompted one young neighbour in @entity41 to refer to @entity3 as ' the @entity234 '			2
the court also heard @entity3 would regularly lose her temper with her own offspring , eventually leading to all five leaving home by the time they were 18			0
on one occasion , she told her then - 13 - year - old son @entity245 to lie to his school about the injuries she inflicted upon him , and also left scarring to his temple when she hit him with a porcelain bowl			0
and @entity252 , now 32 , said of his mother : ' ( @entity254 ) was often a violent person , a red mist would come down and she would suddenly go into a rage that would be over the smallest of things			0
' her rage would then stop like nothing had happened			0
it was like a light switch			0
' @entity3 ’s eldest daughter , 24 - year - old @entity263 , told the jury she called the police on her mother nearly a decade ago after her mother hit her , but did not press charges because she did not want to be taken into care			1
her youngest child , 19 - year - old @entity270 , added that her mother had once tried to push her down the stairs , and , on another occasion , threw a glass picture at her head			0
speaking of her mother ’s arguments with mr @entity3 , miss @entity270 said : ' he ( mr @entity3 ) would try his hardest to defend himself , but he was weak compared with my mum			0
