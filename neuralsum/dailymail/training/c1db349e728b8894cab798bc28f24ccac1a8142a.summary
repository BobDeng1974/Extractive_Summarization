by @entity0 @entity1 is a tiny @entity3 village with barely 20 homes ; boring is a @entity7 town of 10,000 , which proudly boasts two golf courses and its own brewery			1
but the two communities , which sit more than 4,500 miles apart , are today celebrating perhaps the only feature they have in common - their uninteresting names			0
after teaming up in 2012 , the governor of @entity14 declared saturday , august 9 as a public holiday across the entire state - which would be known as @entity17 and @entity18			1
the farming communities of @entity17 , @entity14 and @entity1 , @entity3 partnered up in june 2012 in an effort to boost tourism boring has around 8,000 residents and @entity1 has only about 80			1
both are farming communities boring commemorated the first ' boring and @entity1 ' state holiday last year with an ice cream social in the local park , something they plan on doing again this year this year , the @entity7 are celebrating the public holiday with free ice cream in the park and a piper , who is appropriately playing @entity37 music			1
nobody from @entity1 was able to travel from @entity3 to represent the village , but boring will share the celebrations with its friend by posting photos on their @entity44 page			1
@entity45 , chairman of the @entity46 , told the @entity47 : ' unfortunately nobody could coincide a visit to mark the day			0
' ' we are having free ice cream in the park			2
we will also have a bagpiper playing @entity37 music			0
he was trained in @entity14			0
' we had also hoped to have the sir @entity54 from @entity55 , but they are over in @entity3 taking part in a competition			0
' the two places teamed up last year in a canny effort to boost tourism and combat the notion that their namesakes define them			0
the decision meant both places can sell novelty tourist items , get quirky road signs made and plan exchange visits			0
but the difference in size between @entity17 and @entity1 meant they could not officially become twin towns boring is located about 20 miles southeast of @entity55			2
it has two golf courses and a few restaurants , as well as brewery			1
but the town has no movie theaters , grocery stores or hotels @entity1 is located about 75 miles north of @entity84 and has only 20 homes boring is located about 20 miles southeast of @entity55			1

but the town has no movie theaters , grocery stores or hotels			0
@entity1 is similar but much smaller			0
the @entity3 town is located about 75 miles north of @entity84 and has only 20 homes			1
@entity1 is believed - although it is not confirmed - to have got its name from the leather straps used to carry coffins in @entity3			2
the idea for a partnership came from a @entity1 resident who stumbled on boring during a trip from @entity105 , @entity106 to @entity107			2
a church in @entity1 is pictured @entity109 got its name from @entity109 who moved to the area after the @entity7 civil war			2
the idea for a partnership came from a @entity1 resident who stumbled on boring during a trip from @entity105 , @entity106 to @entity107			0
she took a photo of the @entity17 town sign and sent it to a friend back home in @entity1 , with a message jokingly suggesting that the towns should pair up			0
her friend , @entity123 , then took the idea to a meeting of the @entity1 women 's book club , and before long , leaders from each town were in contact discussed the possibility of a partnership , according to a 2012 story in @entity133			2
