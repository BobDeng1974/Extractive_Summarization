by @entity0 holidaymakers en route from @entity3 to @entity4 on a coach were left stranded at the roadside for 12 hours – after their driver was arrested by police			1
more than 60 passengers – including @entity10 - on the budget @entity12 service were ' abandoned ' at a @entity3 motorway service station after the company failed to send out another driver			1
many people were forced to call and pay for taxis to stay in nearby hotels after discovering it was too late to make alternative travel arrangements			0
officers phoned @entity12 to ask if it was going to send a replacement after detaining the 48 - year - old @entity35 for allegedly using another driver 's tachograph card			1
customers were kept waiting for several hours before being told the company could not send anyone			2
speaking from the scene , one passenger said : ' there 's people of all nationalities on board including @entity10 and @entity47 and none of us know what to do			0
' holidays have been ruined			0
we 've spoken to one man who has a plane to catch tomorrow in @entity47 and has no idea now how he 's going to arrive on time or if the company is going to reimburse him if he misses his plane			0
' police gave some passengers a lift to @entity63 near the border with @entity47 - more than 12 hours after the coach was stopped - so they could continue their journeys			1
the driver was on monday being held at a police station in @entity69 near @entity63			1
he was expected to be questioned by a judge in a private hearing before being released on bail ahead of a full court probe			0
' holidays ruined ' : passengers were left at services on the @entity31 motorway 50 miles north of @entity32 , pictured he was taken into custody at 5pm on sunday after being stopped at @entity80 a half - hour drive north of the @entity83 capital			1
a spokesman for the @entity86 regional police force said : ' officers discovered during a routine stop that the driver was using a tachograph card belonging to someone else and arrested him for using false documentation			1
' we immobilised the vehicle and after considerable effort managed to get through to someone at @entity12 to explain what had happened and ask if the firm would send a replacement driver			1
' the hours went by and we did n't get an answer and some passengers began to make alternative travel arrangements with some leaving by taxi			2
' but ten people ended up spending the night on the bus and as a gesture of goodwill we took them to @entity63 this morning so they could continue their journeys			0
' the coach was travelling from @entity32 to @entity4 via @entity113			0
' there were several nationalities on board including @entity10 nationals			0
@entity118 said the driver on board its @entity32 to @entity4 coach had the right documents ' we understand customers did receive text messages in the end from the company saying it would n't be sending a replacement driver but would reimburse them for any extra costs			1
' but they did n't get those messages for several hours and the company did n't come back to us at all			0
' it 's very rare for us to have to get involved in something like this			0
' it 's not the first time we 've had to immobilise a coach but normally companies send replacement drivers fairly quickly			1
' we do n't know why the arrested driver was using someone else 's card			2

it added : ' our driver had the correct documentation and identification for his journey and was well within his legal driving hours			2
' there appears to have been a technical issue with the way the journey was being recorded			0
' to be very clear , we arranged two buses , supplied by a @entity3 operator , which arrived on site to take passengers onwards to their destination			1
' however , we are concerned that passengers were prevented from using these vehicles by local @entity3 police which obviously led to significant delays for our customers			1
' it added : ' the service was delayed overnight following a technical issue involving the journey recording equipment that arose during a check in @entity3			2
' our team kept in touch with passengers by email throughout the night and attempted to find accommodation for them which unfortunately was not possible			2
' we advised that we would cover all costs for passengers who made their own arrangements for onward travel			0
we will also be issuing a full refund and providing complimentary return travel for all customers affected			0
