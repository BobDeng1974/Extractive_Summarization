although invisibility suits and hover cars are yet to become a reality , it turns out we might be closer to the future than we think			0
@entity7 designers , @entity8 , 24 , and @entity9 , 25 , have created a robot that takes the effort out of applying make - up - by doing it for you			1
the device applies eyeliner with a long black brush , while an attachment smears lipstick on lips , before lighting up when the process is complete			1
the machine is composed of three components : a lipstick wheel , an eyeliner applicator , and a mask which illuminates when the ' beautification ' was complete			1
women were then filmed testing the machine for the two @entity45 students ' art project entitled @entity46			1
when creating a device for such a personal ritual as applying make - up , anyone would think that the robots would favour precision and speed , but this was - hilariously - not the case			0
the beginning of the video shows the designers setting up and creating the machine 's frame which includes two magnified mirrors			1
each device is fitted with chin rests in order to let the user know where to position their faces			0
another girl has felt the wrath of the machine , which has dealt her face many random strokes of eyeliner a gallery visitor rests her head on the chin rest , expecting eyeliner to be expertly applied the eyeliner is fixed to a robotic arm , which moves the brush in a movement intended to mimic that of a hand , against the backdrop of a mirror with the motto , ' with determined brush strokes the cosmetic ritual takes its course ' inscribed into the glass			2
the lipstick wand is secured to a crank which rotates in small circles			2
once each area has been completed , a mask threaded with @entity96 lights up in the corresponding part of the female face			0
the video shows how it 's only when visitors begin trying out the make - up robot that they realise precision is not the machine 's greatest attribute			0
each woman rests their chin on the chin - rest and the eyeliner brush is seen swiping wildly , leaving them with smears of kohl on their foreheads , eyelids and along the bridge of their nose			2
at one point the robot actually smears the eyeliner directly into a unsuspecting girl 's eye			2
the lipstick robot is slightly more successful than the eyeliner robot , as the user can control how much lipstick is applied next a woman trials the lipstick wand but the speedy circular rotation of the lipstick is n't well aligned to the natural shape of a pair of lips			1
the user is left with a circular smudge over her lips and chin			0
but @entity8 and @entity9 say the robots were n't intended to revolutionise make - up , explaining : ' we wanted to explore the relationship between humans and machines			1
' the designers found the results of the art project were differed from their initial expectations			1
' we expected the outcome to be threatening and a little creepy but instead we discovered a very affectionate side in our robot			0
one woman is waiting for her eyeliner to be applied , with her face directly aligned with the brush she gets a shock when the eyeliner brush swipes directly into her eye ' the interaction with our machine made people smile			2
its tireless spins , the way it did nâ€™t quite succeed , it seemed to have its own ideas of what looked good in a human face			0
' on their @entity171 page , the pair explain the inspiration for the project : ' without us paying much attention , many processes and rituals in our lives have been taken over by machines which are said to be cold and unemotional			1
' the designers added : ' our machines , however , have their own will , their own ideals			1
we want to put users in the beauty care of robots , to experience what it feels like when delicate decisions that are usually made by themselves are now determined by machines			0
' the third component of the make - up robots is a light mask ( pictured ) , which is meant to illuminate parts of the face it is satisfied with			0
