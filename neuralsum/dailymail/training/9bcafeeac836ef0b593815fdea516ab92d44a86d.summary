@entity0 cut a confident figure on declaring that leaders @entity2 would definitely win the title in any other country from this commanding position			1
the @entity7 comfortably beat a gallant @entity8 at @entity9 to maintain their blistering start to a season which some believe could end with them emulating the @entity14 ' invincibles ' of a decade ago			1
looking as relaxed as he has done all year , @entity0 had two words to describe why @entity2 did n’t succumb to defeat as they did at @entity8 in march , scribbling ‘ big balls ’ on a pad of paper			1
he had written ‘ balls ’ to sum up what they had lacked on losing four months ago			0
they may have to do that while constantly managing the fitness of @entity47 , who is ruled out of the @entity49 clash against @entity50 on tuesday			2
once again the manager chose to snipe at the way in which @entity53 have treated his star striker			2
‘ if you were in another league i would say immediately “ yes , we ’ll do it ”			0
in the @entity32 the only thing i can say is that we can do it , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ in the @entity32 it is stupid to say you ’re going to do it because there are so many good teams and a long way to go - some very difficult runs in front of us			1
@entity34 celebrates scoring @entity2 's second goal in the win at @entity9 @entity72 ( left ) celebrates his opening goal from a free - kick with team - mate @entity75 @entity47 takes on @entity38 's @entity76 earlier in the campaign , with the @entity2 striker 's injury a cause of much frustration for @entity0 ‘ what is obvious - what you all feel - is that we are a better team than last season			1
there is a clear evolution			0
it ’s not based on the fact that we bought two fantastic players [ @entity47 and @entity34 ]			2
’ @entity47 was absent for the first time this campaign and remains a doubt for next sunday ’s trip to @entity96			0
‘ after @entity14 he went to the national team , played two big matches against @entity99 and @entity100 and has come back in a condition where he is n’t available for his club , ’ @entity0 added			1
asked if he had spoken to the @entity53 medical staff , the 51 - year - old was sardonic in reply			2
‘ for what ? to spend money on calls ? no. @entity0 makes a point with the fourth official during the @entity9 clash palace boss @entity113 greets @entity0 before his side 's 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity2 @entity113 was furious with the decision to send off of @entity118 ( not pictured ) ‘ i think he ’ll be in great condition in mid-november to be back for the national team			1
we ’ll take good care of him			0
he ’ll play for me when he has free time from the national team			0
’ despite @entity0 's humorous scribblings it was no laughing matter for @entity113 , who bemoaned big - club bias after claiming a number of @entity130 's decisions were unfair on the @entity8			1
‘ half the team surrounded the referee , ’ he said			0
‘ i thought they influenced him at times today			0
i thought @entity135 should have been booked early on [ for a late challenge on @entity36 ]			0
he left a lot to be desired - the ref has had better days			0

blues beat @entity8 2 - 1 at @entity9 to maintain *unbeaten* start
