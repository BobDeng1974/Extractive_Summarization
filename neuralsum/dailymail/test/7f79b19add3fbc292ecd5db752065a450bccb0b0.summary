@entity0 allegedly insisted her 44 - year - old assistant be the surrogate for her and then fiancé @entity3			1
the revelation comes just after reports that the former couple are embroiled in a legal fight over her frozen eggs , which they planned to have children with before their bitter split			1
according to a thursday report by @entity13 , @entity3 claimed that @entity0 demanded her friend and employee serve as the surrogate over his ' objections as well as the recommendations of the parties ’ doctor '			1
a source for the publication added : ' @entity37 insisted on it			0
she said the assistant was the only person she could trust			0
' the insider added that @entity3 would like to keep the embryos in tact to have his own children : ' he told @entity37 he would raise the children himself , they would be very well taken care of			0
he would n’t sue her for child support			0
she would have no parental responsibility			0
she refuses to allow him to take charge of the embryos			0
' on wednesday it was reported @entity3 has filed a lawsuit in @entity52 in a bid to prevent the @entity55 actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through @entity57 , according to @entity58			1
legal fight : a magazine claims @entity3 has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee @entity37 in a bid to prevent her from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through @entity57 , pictured here in 2011 @entity0 ’s representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by @entity68 on wednesday			1
court documents , filed under pseudonyms @entity71 and @entity72 , detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in november 2013			1
@entity3 , 39 , is seeking to ensure the female embryos are not destroyed , but @entity0 has refused to ' agree to their preservation under all circumstances , ' according to the legal papers			2
the lawsuit was first filed in august 2014 before it was refiled again on april 1 with updated information and after @entity3 sought new legal representation			2
another claim in the documents is that , previously , the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate , but the procedure failed			2
elsewhere in the lawsuit , it is claimed 42 - year - old actress @entity0 - who got engaged to @entity96 hunk @entity94 on christmas day after six months of dating - was ' physically and mentally abusive ' to @entity3			1
wrangle : the lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms @entity72 and @entity99 no directive : ultimately , the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge , but it would be unlikely that @entity3 would be able to use the embryos without @entity37 's consent , according to a legal expert who spoke to @entity58 the documents state : ' she punched him in the face on two occasions , kicked him , and threw her phone at his head			1
she also routinely bullied him , calling him a " loser , " " worthless " and other degrading names			0
' in april 2013 , @entity0 - who has a 23 - year - old son @entity116 from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children			1
she revealed that she and @entity3 - who she dated on - off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and , as a result , had a lot of radiation			2
complicated matter : in this page of the document it states @entity37 and @entity3 were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that @entity37 had insisted on using a 44 - year - old friend and emloyee arduous process : after the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate getting ugly : page five of the document further details @entity37 and @entity3 's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges @entity37 was physically , emotionally and mentally abusive to him @entity58 has previously claimed that now @entity0 and 38 - year - old @entity94 have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own			1
the actress recently told @entity150 magazine that while having another child would be ' weird ' , it something she might do if it made @entity94 happy			0
she told the magazine : ' my son , @entity116 , is 23 years old , which is going to be really weird if i have another baby			0
but , you know , @entity94 wants babies and if it 's going to make him super-happy , then ... ' the complicated legal wrangle with @entity3 still stands , though			0
moving on : the @entity55 actress is now engaged to @entity94 and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate other documentation obtained by @entity58 which forms part of the lawsuit shows that @entity99 ( @entity0 ) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death , while @entity3 refused to agree to this condition			1
no agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended their relationship			0
ultimately , the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge			0
however legal experts told @entity58 that it would be unlikely that @entity3 will be able to use the embryos without @entity37 's consent			2
