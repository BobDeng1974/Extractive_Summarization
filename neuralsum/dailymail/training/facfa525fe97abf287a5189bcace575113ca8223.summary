@entity0 is desperate to be offered the platform to show @entity2 he is equipped to be their @entity4 fly - half			1
@entity0 orchestrated @entity6 's 19 - 12 victory over @entity7 at the @entity8 on saturday with his 14 - point haul restoring @entity10 to the @entity12 summit			2
@entity2 name their squad for the autumn series against @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 on october 22 with head coach @entity20 blessed with options at fly - half			1
@entity0 kicks a penalty during @entity6 's victory over @entity7 on saturday @entity0 ( centre ) tries to stop @entity7 's @entity26 @entity27 is clear favourite to pull the strings at next year 's @entity4 , but the @entity30 is currently struggling with a thigh strain and has also been hampered by a knee injury this year			1
snapping at his heals are @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity0 , who believes the chance to add to his solitary cap will enable him to press his own claim			1
' i 'm craving the opportunity			0
once you get that opportunity it 's up to you , but that 's all i want , ' @entity0 said			2
' i 'm not sure what 's going on in the minds of the selectors , but i 'm just playing the best rugby i can for my @entity49 are a few players who have been doing well in my position			0
@entity36 is one of a number of @entity54 fly - halves looking to break into the national set up @entity56 's @entity34 ( centre ) is another contender who @entity20 could turn to at fly - half @entity59 's @entity35 passes the ball during the match against @entity62 on saturday ' that 's good from a national point of view , but also personally because to be in contention you have to play the best you can			1
' my aim is to play the best i can for @entity6 and see where that takes me			0
' far less clarity exists at inside centre , a position that is giving @entity20 his most troubling headache			0
one of @entity2 's options @entity73 used his speed and power to score the only try at the @entity8 , but his handling was otherwise poor			1
@entity73 makes a long for the try line as he is held up by @entity7 's @entity79 @entity80 celebrates scoring his side 's second try during @entity56 's game against @entity84 @entity80 is the @entity12 's form centre and @entity86 is an admirer of @entity88 is , but @entity0 views his @entity10 team - mate @entity73 as an irresistible force			2
' @entity73 has a lot of positive attributes and he 's always trying to improve , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity73 is a very physically capable man with good speed and good strength			0
' he 's deceptively quick			0
you would n't say that his main attribute , but he can move for a big man , so it 's nice having him in the team			0
