a couple are searching for answers after a police officer shot dead their beloved dog @entity3 after he escaped their yard - but will not face a review			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , said they were shocked when the officer knocked on their door on thursday to say he had shot a dog and wanted to see if it was theirs			1
they assumed it would n't be their 35 - pound mixed breed dog @entity3 , a loving pet who they thought was safely contained in the yard			1
so they were stunned to see his body on the ground			0
' when i saw @entity3 , i lost it , ' mr @entity30 , 24 , wrote in an account of the incident on @entity35			1
missed : @entity3 the dog , pictured with one of the family cats , was shot dead by a police officer on thursday evening after he reportedly became aggressive towards a woman while she was walking her dog despite never having escaped before , @entity3 had somehow got through a gate in their yard and had wandered into the street			1
the police told the @entity46 that @entity3 had run over to a woman walking her dog and became aggressive so she sprayed him with pepper spray			1
he continued to be aggressive , she said			0
she called police and when the officer , @entity51 , arrived , @entity3 again became aggressive , police said			1
@entity51 shouted at the dog to stop and when he did not , he shot the animal twice			1
officer @entity54 told the @entity46 that the police report - which is not yet available - did not mention any injuries to the woman who had called police			1
he added that the officer will not face a review board for the shooting , as is protocol , but that he did have to explain in detail his decision to use deadly force			2
questions : @entity3 pictured with his family 's other dog , @entity69			2
his owners say they find it hard to believe that he became so aggressive - and questioned why the officer did n't tase or hit the dog before shooting him gentle : @entity3 was shot after he somehow got out of the couple 's yard - which he had never done before when @entity30 went into the street and learned what had happened , he ' lost it ' , he said			1
' i yelled at the police asking them why they had to shoot him , ' he wrote			0
' he is a 30 pound dog for goodness sake			0
what about a taser , a baton , or even a kick to the face ? ' family : @entity8 and @entity9 said they have no children so it was as if @entity3 was their son he said that he was horrified when the police said that he should be fined for having the dog out			1
' again , i lost it , ' he wrote in the @entity35 post			0
' i yelled at them that it was absurd that i had to pay a fine for them to unjustly ( my opinion , obviously ) kill my dog			0
' i wish it were easy to believe that the police were honest and telling the truth but things just did not make sense			0
' how they described his behavior was totally uncharacteristic of @entity3			0
' he said that the dog , who was adopted by his brother - in - law a few years ago , took a liking to him and his wife and they ultimately took him in when his brother - in - law could not longer look after him			0
' it is hard not to get attached to a dog that loves you so deeply , ' @entity30 wrote on @entity35			2
' @entity9 and i do not have children yet so - in a way - @entity3 was like our little boy			2
' he recounted how @entity3 doted on their other pets , and when one of their cats had feline leukemia and could no longer look after herself , @entity3 would clean her instead			0
' i know " every dog owner thinks their dog is the sweetest dog in the world " but @entity3 really was one of the sweetest in the world , ' he said			2
loving : @entity8 explained how gentle the 35 - pound dog was with their other animals , recalling how he would clean one of their cats when she developed leukemia and could no longer clean herself home : mr @entity30 said the police officer knocked on his door to say he had shot a dog outside but he never thought it would be @entity3			1
he was stunned when he saw the dog 's body in the road ' he lived to be petted , eat wet dog food and doggie bacon , and sleep on our laps			0
' speaking to the @entity46 , @entity30 said he was skeptical of the police 's version of events and that his dog likely approached the woman because he wanted to be petted			1
he also said he has no idea how the gate opened , and suggested that children in the neighborhood might have opened it			0
' i trust the police , ' he said			0
' i trust that they 're here to protect us			0
it 's just hard for me to believe that this was the only option available - to shoot a dog that had only loved people his entire life			2

@entity3 was in his owners ' yard in @entity10 , @entity11 on thursday when he somehow got out into the street
police say he approached a woman walking her dog and became aggressive towards her , so she pepper sprayed him and called the cops
an officer arrived and shouted at him to stop and then shot him twice
@entity30 was stunned when he learned that the dog was @entity3 , a loving 35 - pound former *shelter* rescue dog
he said the police officer 's account does n't add up
the officer , @entity51 , had to explain to his *superiors* why he felt it was necessary to shoot the dog but will not face a review
