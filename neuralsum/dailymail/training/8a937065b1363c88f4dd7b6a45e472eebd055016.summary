goodbye to the @entity3 , farewell to the @entity0 and anybody sporting a @entity2 had better start growing out that fringe fast			1
this autumn it 's all about the @entity6 , or wavy bob			1
yes , after the long bob , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) bob and the fringed bob , the wavy bob is the only hairdo in town			2
queen of the wob brigade is @entity17 , who grew out last year 's pixie cut into the casual flicky style			1
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 have gone for the chop - and every time i switch on strictly i see @entity27 's wob bouncing across the dancefloor			1
what 's more , it is supposed to work on almost every face shape			2
' the wob is carefree , ' says @entity46 - based celebrity stylist @entity45			1
' the waviness brings out the sexiness in women			2
' well , it certainly looks lovely on @entity51			2
but would it suit me , 20 years her senior at a ripe old 44 , at least a stone heavier and with no hairstylist in my entourage ? i was n't so sure			2
my hairdo is n't so much low - maintenance as no - maintenance			1
i do n't even own a can of hairspray and the last time i visited the salon with a photograph , saying ' i want to look like her ' , it was the mid-nineties and i was clutching a picture of @entity71			2
on me , the ' @entity72 ' was a disaster			2
i could n't be bothered to style it properly , so it ended up more @entity75			2
i grew out the layers and since then i 've kept my hair one length , usually just below the collarbone			2
so maybe it was time for a style reboot , and perhaps a wob would be the answer			1
my ten - year - old daughter was solidly behind the idea			1
but when i sat down in @entity88 's @entity87 salon , i found myself feeling wobbly			2
all around were chic - looking women with cascades of glossy hair - yet i was sacrificing my long locks for a short , deliberately scruffy bob			1
was i insane ? stylist @entity94 was reassuring			2
' it will definitely suit your face shape , ' she said			0
but was i too old for such a trendy look ? ' oh no ! we 've had all sorts of people asking for them			0
' the @entity103 brigade : @entity17 , left , and @entity22 have both got the haircut then she sliced through six inches of hair in a single snip and there was no going back			1
a wob may look carefree but it 's quite complicated to create			1
@entity110 snipped my hair off in a straight bob just below the chin			0
then she set to work with thinning scissors to reduce the volume - a relief , as otherwise i could see myself with a triangular ' do ' like @entity118 , @entity120 's love interest in a @entity121			1
' the problem is you 've got about five times as much hair as @entity17 , ' @entity110 explained			1
once my hair was lying closer to my face , she chopped into it at the bottom to add the required touch of shagginess			0
finally she added a few romantic waves with curling tongs			0
' do n't curl the hair right to the end , ' she counselled			0
' you want to leave a little flick out at the bottom , so it looks very casual			0
' for the final touch she sprayed my hair with @entity141 's @entity143 spray , which contains cottonseed oil for shine - free hold ( glossiness is a no - no in a wob , apparently )			1
et voila ! two hours later , i had the season 's ultimate un-do			0
looking in the mirror , i was shocked to see air where i 'd once had hair			0
but gradually i found myself warming to my wob			1
the casual waves added width to the top half of my face and made my eyes look wider and my jawline slimmer			0
less time on hair styling means more time on rehearsing : @entity163 's @entity27 is another fan of the style ' wow ! ' said my husband that night			0
my eldest daughter loved it too			0
' it 's epic ! ' she shrieked			0
the eight - year - old was n't so sure			1
' you look messy , ' she said , fetching the hairbrush			0
it was next morning that the wob 's real benefits started to reveal themselves			1
i leapt out of bed , flung on my clothes and hustled the children off to school without bothering even to comb my bed - head			1
but as i crashed through the school gates , i had a smug conviction that this morning i looked chic rather than shabby			0
then i went to the gym and did n't get my hair caught in the machinery			0
my friends said i looked younger			0
my wob was n't too hard to style			1
that night , for a party , i re-did it using my sister 's hair tongs to add the waves , then glued them in with @entity194 's @entity193			0
not everyone liked the look			0
my mother was frankly puzzled			0
' what does it mean ? ' she asked			0
and in truth , the style is not quite as easy to wear as its fans claim			0
a messy hairdo can look fabulously edgy with smoky eyes , glossy lips and a designer outfit , much less so with no make - up and yoga pants			1
i 've cut down on hair - brushing time in the mornings but have to spend extra minutes applying mascara and lipstick			1
that 's a small price to pay , though , for never having a ' bad hair day '			0
and the wob 's real secret is that if you do need to look sophisticated , a few brush - strokes and a blast with the dryer can turn it into the sort of sleek bob even your mother would admire			1

queen of the wob brigade is @entity17
the look is sizzling : youthful , edgy and seemingly low - maintenance
