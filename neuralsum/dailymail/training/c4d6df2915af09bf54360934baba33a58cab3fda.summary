walking the dogs very early yesterday , i thought long and hard about saturday ’s match			2
the @entity3 was there to be won and we came up short			2
november 8 , 2014 must go down as the day this @entity7 set - up started smelling the coffee and really taking stock of where they are			1
@entity7 need to move on from all this team - building , pride in the shirt , old players ’ names in the tunnel , tweets from fans , ‘ you do n’t play for @entity7 , you represent @entity7 ’ , all that stuff			1
@entity7 complain about a refereeing decision , but the time for excuses is running out @entity25 runs at the @entity27 defence , but @entity7 need to start playing nuts - and - bolts rugby , and winning @entity7 21 - 24 @entity27 highlights these are all a given in any high - performing team and we do n’t need this corporate jargon			1
far too much was made of @entity34 ’s ‘ failure ’			2
@entity7 won 10 out of 13 games in 2011 under @entity34			1
i ’d love to know what he is making of all of this			0
from now on it has to be all about nuts - and - bolts rugby			1
we have lost the last five against @entity27 and now we have to circle the wagons , get some sulphur flying around , add some real anger into this team and concentrate on playing ruthless and world - class rugby			1
winning the next match is all that matters			0
create a siege mentality it is time for the @entity7 coaching team to step up to the plate			1
and i mean that positively			0
what an opportunity for a coach			0
@entity7 will go head to head with a stack of good sides in the next 12 months , with hard - nosed ‘ winning ’ coaches who all have @entity7 in their sights			1
@entity64 and @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , a new - look @entity68 under @entity69 , @entity70 with @entity71 , @entity72 for the @entity73 and , of course , @entity75 and his @entity27			2
@entity76 is about to come up against some of the best teams , and coaches , in world rugby we may love beating them but they love beating us more , especially at @entity83			1
this will only intensify as we begin celebrating a home @entity85			2
we do not have exclusivity over ‘ pride in the shirt ’			0
we need to create a siege mentality now			0
put a kicker at @entity92 when the game develops like it did on saturday , @entity7 badly lack a natural kicker at @entity92			1
@entity95 was excellent in @entity27 territory for the first 20 minutes , but @entity7 ’s lack of a tactical kicking game was so evident in the second half when they got pinned in their own half			1
i ’ve been advocating this for a long time now and i see one or two commentators are beginning to back the notion ! @entity25 kicks clear on saturday , but @entity7 need a second option for their tactical kicking game with @entity107 out of favour , @entity25 ( left ) could be picked to play outside @entity109 ( right ) there is a strong argument for moving @entity25 to 12			1
in my ideal xv i ’d do just that and start with @entity107 at @entity114			0
those two in harness would give me the midfield options i am looking for			0
i ’m not sure yet whether @entity109 is ready to start at fly - half but i ’d love to be proved wrong and to see @entity118 and @entity25 being given a chance to play alongside one another for 80 minutes			1
tick some more boxes @entity7 must think seriously about the structure of the team			1
what do we need to beat the world ’s best ? firstly , a nasty , aggressive , ball - winning front five who come out on top at the set - piece			2
@entity132 ticked , @entity133 has done an outstanding job in this department			0
secondly , a well - balanced back row with pace			1
@entity140 , for all his virtues , has n’t got the pace for this level at present and ca n’t play 80 minutes			1
@entity7 's pack demonstrated that they could dominated at the set - piece , with the front five excellent the back row is a problem , and @entity140 lacks the pace to perform at the very highest level we have options although for unfathomable reasons @entity151 has been declared ineligible			1
i ’d play @entity154 at @entity155 , @entity156 at @entity157 at openside			0
and if we pick dangerous attacking wings , we need to use them			0
other than returning kicks , if @entity162 touched the ball in attack on saturday , i must have missed it			0
lack of caps no excuse everyone has to stop talking about @entity7 as this young , inexperienced side			2
this is not an @entity172 , this is the @entity7 xv			2
i applaud the selection of the debutants , even if @entity176 ’s first cap was well overdue			0
but to suggest their inexperience is a definitive factor is not accurate			0
the likes of @entity181 in the second row demonstrated that inexperience is not an issue the evidence for this is in the front five where @entity7 dominated			1
we had @entity189 and @entity190 , effectively fourth and fifth - choice second rowers , and and an unfamiliar front row – all were magnificent			2
what we lacked was the game plan and key selection decisions to utilise the platform the pack provided			2
beware the @entity199 this week is going to be one of the toughest of @entity76 ’s career			0
there will be a huge backlash from @entity73 after losing to @entity67			0
my team from those available : @entity176 ; @entity162 , @entity207 , @entity25 , @entity208 ; @entity107 , @entity209 ; @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity190 , @entity213 , @entity156 ( c ) , @entity151 , @entity154			2
the @entity73 will be up for it physically more than ever , so @entity7 must look to out - think and outsmart them and that needs great coaching and great selecting			1
@entity217 is experiencing a dip in form and confidence — it happens — so i would go for broke and introduce @entity176 at full - back			2
make hq a fortress the @entity83 crowd can still go horribly quiet and @entity7 need them to up their game if home advantage is to count for anything at the @entity85			1
building an atmosphere is much more than putting white flags on seats and playing patriotic music			0
are you really going to start cheering for @entity7 just because the big screen says ‘ @entity236 ’ ? the @entity83 crowd may have drowned out the haka , but they were still quiet in patches the boards flash up the message come on @entity7 , as @entity241 dives over for a @entity27 try i was put out to see a huge @entity27 billboard just outside the ground , even the electronic boards in the stadium said : ‘ we welcome @entity27 ’			1
the fans have a big role to play but first they must be excited by the team			0
it was very flat on saturday and as a coach you need to ask why that is			0
@entity83 must become a fortress , not the home of rugby			1
life after @entity259 in @entity67 , the king is dead , long live the @entity260			0
@entity259 is gone but @entity67 have a wonderfully gifted talisman in @entity262			0
that was a fantastic , totally convincing win over @entity73			0
@entity67 are profiting from having a nailed - on half - back pairing in @entity262 and @entity265			1
@entity262 holds off a tackle during a game in which he showed he can be @entity67 's talisman optimistic over @entity65 @entity65 can still score tries against the best and if i was @entity7 that would concern me			1
i do n’t share some people ’s pessimism over @entity65 falling short against southern hemisphere sides			0
once they secure that breakthrough win , there will be others			0
@entity65 showed they can score tries against the best teams , and that 's bad news for @entity7 next year hail the great @entity280 @entity68 are alive and kicking and i expect them to give the @entity27 a good run for their money on saturday			1
do n’t underestimate their win over @entity285			0
i enjoyed @entity68 ’s speed of thought and deed			0
the @entity280 are always at their best playing at pace .			2

@entity7 should move @entity293 fly - half @entity25 to twelve
@entity95 started well but @entity7 need a greater tactical kicking game
back row needs a shake - up , @entity140 lacks the pace for this level
@entity7 need to make @entity83 a fortress , not just the home of rugby
