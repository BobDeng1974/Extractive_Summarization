they said the quantity of the deadly substance found on his remains pointed to the involvement of a third party			0
the remains of @entity6 were exhumed from his grave in november 2012 so international forensic experts could search for additional clues to his death work underway : in november 2012 , workers began prying open the concrete - encased tomb in @entity6 's former government headquarters in the @entity110 city of @entity111 @entity66 's @entity112 ( @entity112 ) has yet to release its findings			1

today a @entity15 investigator said he would soon name the people he believed were responsible for the death almost a decade after he started searching for suspects			0
many @entity15 have long believed @entity47 killed him - a charge @entity47 flatly denies - but an official @entity132 investigation headed by @entity133 has yet to produce any evidence			0
' i promise that the next press conference will be the last , and will cast into the light of day everyone who perpetrated , took part in or conspired in the matter , ' @entity133 told @entity142 television			0
' we are in the last 15 minutes of the investigation , ' he added			0
@entity47 president @entity145 , who shared the 1994 @entity146 with @entity6 and @entity47 prime minister @entity147 , said last month that the reports of polonium poisoning were unbelievable			2
' if someone had wanted to get rid of @entity6 , it would have been easier to do it with a bullet , ' he said			2
cause of death : @entity15 leader @entity6 saying goodbye as he boarded a @entity156 army helicopter to fly to @entity37 to seek medical treatment			2
@entity6 died a month later in a @entity4 military hospital the @entity26 team 's findings sparked fresh accusations from the @entity15 and increased tensions with @entity47 at a delicate time			1

@entity47 and the @entity165 blamed @entity6 for a wave of suicide bombings and other attacks on @entity47 during the uprising , while @entity6 insisted he was powerless to prevent @entity15 from retaliating for deadly @entity47 military operations in the occupied territories			0
