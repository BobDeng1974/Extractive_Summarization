a woman who was given just five years to live with an aggressive cancer claims she has beaten the disease - by eating pineapples			1
@entity5 - @entity4 , 31 , found out she had thyroid cancer and reluctantly went under the knife to remove more than 20 lumps three years ago			1
but when the disease spread and doctors said she had a maximum of five years to live , @entity5 rejected life - lengthening chemotherapy which she claims had ' killed ' friends			1
@entity5 - @entity4 , 31 , found out she had thyroid cancer three years ago and decided to battle the disease by eating healthily she gave her life an overhaul to try and banish the disease , eating up to three pineapples a day - as well as dozens of grapefruits , lemons , apples , kiwis and bananas			1
the fruits are high in a cancer - zapping proteins - called bromelain - which some scientists claim ' eat away ' at tumours			1
the former model also ditched other ' toxins ' in her life - including alcohol , meat and even her husband - and within just six months she says that her grade four cancer was almost gone			1
medics have now confirmed the marketing worker is completely free of tumours and she now runs a website encouraging others to take control of their health			0
@entity5 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' i changed my whole outlook on life			1
@entity5 reluctantly went under the knife to remove more than 20 lumps ' instead of living for parties and weekends and working and doing the same stuff i did day in , day out , i changed my whole view			1
' i decided to live for me and love life for what it is			0
it sounds so away with the fairies , but it is the only way to live - and it worked			2
' i got rid of everything toxic in my life and became so grateful for life			0
' i had got rid of the massive tumours by arresting and starving them with the pure science of food			0
' like pineapple , kiwi and papaya - i found out that the bromelain eats away at a particular protein layer of the cancer			1
' there is a protein in animal products that feed the cancers and when i was eating big hefty meals my body could n't heal because all of my energy was going into digesting the meal			0
' if i was eating one bit of fruit at a time , which eats away at the layer of the cancer , i was killing it and within six months my cancer was gone			2
' there are now no tumours left in me			0
i 'm so grateful for the cancer now in hindsight because it turned me into the person that i was meant to be			1
' @entity5 found a lump above her left collarbone in 2011 and an ultrasound revealed around 20 papillary thyroid carcinomas			1
doctors said if the parcel courier did n't have the lumps removed she would lose her voice and possibly die within a year , so she endured a four - and - a - half hour operation			2
@entity5 now runs a website encouraging others to take control of their health			1
she also had radioactive treatment to ' mop up ' any cancer that was left and two months later doctors performed a scan to check			2
but she was horrified when it revealed the cancer had spread to her liver and the back of her neck - with pre-cancerous cells also in her lung - and she had a maximum of five years to live			1
doctors told her to come back in six months for chemotherapy to reduce the incurable cancer but @entity5 refused			1
she had lost both her best friend @entity120 , 31 , and cousin @entity121 , 13 , to cancer in 2009 , and blames body - weakening chemo for their demise			1
@entity125 @entity5 , who was living in @entity126 , @entity127 , at the time , recalled : ' i was a blubbering mess			1
' i thought , ' what have i done to get myself in this situation ? ' that was the darkest point i have ever been when i was in hospital			0
@entity5 pictured with her friend 's children making one of the fruit smoothies which she claims has cured her cancer @entity5 continued : ' [ the doctor ] said come to come back in nine months because they had done too much to me there , and we can give you chemo			1
' instantly alarm bells went off in my head			0
my best friend and my cousin died because of chemo and there was no way i was doing that			0
' i got strong from that point			0
i stopped going into myself and crying			0
' i decided i had five years left , or six months to get rid of this crap , and show them that i can do it on my own			2
' i started eating so much fruit - sometimes weeks on a fruit only diet			2
' @entity5 researched on the internet and switched to an almost entirely fruit and vegetable diet			2
she gorged on fruits like pineapple which are high in bromelain which some nutritionists claim ' eats away ' at cancer , and ditched heavy meals which zapped energy away from ' healing '			2
@entity5 binned chemical - filled beauty products and cleaning sprays , quit smoking and took up yoga in order to get rid of the disease she binned chemical - filled beauty products and cleaning sprays , quit smoking and took up yoga , as well splitting up with her husband of two years			1
as well as joining a positive - thinking dance group which performs in public places , she took up meditation and gave up her un-fulfilling job as a courier			2
she explained : ' stress , chemicals and animal products all feed cancer , so i just got rid of them			2
' my husband was not supportive and it was n't working , we we split up too			2
' i had got rid of the massive tumours by arresting and starving it with the pure science of food and a positive attitude			0
' medics have now confirmed @entity5 is completely free of tumours when she returned to her doctor six months after her dire diagnosis tests confirmed she had almost completely killed her cancer			1
a test for thyroglobulin - a protein produced by cancerous cells - revealed she had reduced her levels from 13 to 0.7 nanograms per millilitre			2
recent tests showed her cancer was at a 0.2 level - just 0.1 above they expected healthy level , and in the normal range for healthy people			1
@entity5 , who runs a modelling agency said : ' i 'm living life on my terms now			1
i 'm not upset , i 'm not waking up sad , i 'm waking up choosing what i want to do with my life			0
' @entity218 , director at the @entity219 in @entity220 , has helped @entity5 , and has seen her test results			2
he said : ' at this point in time , we can say that there is ned - ' no evidence of disease ' in @entity5			1
' her tumor markers which reflect the number of cancerous cells has been well within the normal range for over two years , so we can confidently say that her stage four thyroid cancer is under effective management			1
' he continued : ' @entity5 possesses a level of faith , self - love and purpose that i am sure is a factor in her remarkable healing journey			1
' i can tell you that most thyroid cancer patients with similar circumstances to @entity5 who follow the conventional path do not survive or experience a very poor quality of life			1
' @entity248 is an infection of aberrant cells and treating cancer is like dealing with a bacterial infection			0
' we attempt to maintain an environment not conducive towards tumour growth and proliferation			0
' diet plays a major role along with regular exercise , positive attitude and even spirituality			0
' fruits like pineapple contain a mixture of proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain known to have anti-cancer activity			0
' science does not provide all the answers and we most remain open to forces beyond our comprehension and understanding			0
' @entity5 ate up to three pineapples a day to try and get rid of cancer when asked about whether pineapples and other fruit could have helped to beat @entity5 's cancer , oncologist professor @entity275 said : ' the truth is we just do n't know			1
' it 's much more likely that the cancer is going through a quiescent phase			0
' doctors say that there is a year to live or a specific amount of time but they really do n't know definite times			0
' there may be some truth that pineapples would help to beat cancer and we do in fact use some plant extracts in chemotherapy drugs , including yew trees and periwinkles			0
' but there is no evidence to say that this would be the case			0
' @entity300 , senior information nurse at @entity301 says there is no evidence that fruit like pineapples can cure cancer			0
she said : ' there 's no scientific evidence that eating pineapples , or large amounts of fruit , can cure cancer			0
' a cancer diagnosis can sometimes prompt people to make lifestyle changes like taking exercise and eating healthily			0
' while studies show that having a healthy diet can reduce the risk of developing cancer , there 's no strong evidence to show that diet can cure cancer			2
' leading a healthy lifestyle , including eating a balanced diet can make people feel better and may reduce the likelihood of other medical conditions			0
' anyone with cancer who is considering a particular diet or alternative therapy should discuss it with their doctor			0
