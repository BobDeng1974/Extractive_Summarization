by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 7 june 2013 just 20 minutes of yoga a day sharpens the mind , researchers say			1
the ancient practice was found to be more effective at boosting brain power than conventional aerobic exercise			1
researchers in @entity8 discovered that a single session of @entity11 yoga significantly improved a person 's speed and accuracy when tested on their working memory and concentration			1
relax : the ancient practice of yoga provides almost instant mental benefits			1
scientists found that a 20 - minute session of @entity11 yoga outperformed a run on the treadmill in terms of boosting memory and concentration lead author of the study , @entity27 , professor of kinesiology ( human movement ) , health and sport studies at @entity31 in @entity32 , explained : ' yoga is an ancient @entity37 science and way of life that includes not only physical movements and postures but also regulated breathing and meditation			1
' the practice involves an active attentional or mindfulness component but its potential benefits have not been thoroughly explored			0
' during the experimental yoga sessions participants were asked to assume postures stood up , sat down and laid down , while keeping their breathing steady			2
the exercises included isometric contractions of different muscles in the body , where the muscles are tensed and relaxed without moving any limbs			2
the exercises were followed by a mediation session , when participants focussed on posture and deep breathing			1
researchers also put the guinea pigs through their paces on a treadmill for the same 20 - minute period , keeping their heart rate up between 60 and 70 per cent of the maximum			0
working up a sweat is good for heart health but it is not as effective as yoga at calming the mind they found that people who had been for a 20 - minute jog were less able to focus mentally on tasks than they were following a yoga session			1
@entity27 said : ' it appears that following yoga practice , the participants were better able to focus their mental resources , process information quickly , more accurately and also learn , hold and update pieces of information more effectively than after performing an aerobic exercise bout			2
' the breathing and meditative exercises aim at calming the mind and body and keeping distracting thoughts away while you focus on your body , posture or breath			1
'' maybe these processes translate beyond yoga practice when you try to perform mental tasks or day - to - day activities			2
' @entity27 conceded that the team could not pinpoint any specific process that takes place during yoga that boosted the mental state of the participants , suggesting the relaxation from meditation could hold the answer			0
she said : ' many factors could explain the results			0
' enhanced self - awareness that comes with meditational exercises is just one of the possible mechanisms			0
' hatha yoga is an ancient form of yoga that was first described in 15th century @entity37			2
it may have existed well before this however			0
hatha yoga is sometimes called ‘ dual ’ yoga because it includes a duality between two opposites : the sun ( in @entity124 , ‘ ha ’ ) and the moon ( ‘ tha ’ )			0
it uses physical positions to help control breathing , which in turn helps to calm the mind and prepare a person for mediatation			1
many modern forms of yoga use @entity11 yoga positions as their foundation			1
' besides , meditation and breathing exercises are known to reduce anxiety and stress , which in turn can improve scores on some cognitive tests			1
' the study , published in the @entity146 and @entity147 , involved 30 female students at @entity150 's @entity149			0
kinesiology and community health professor @entity151 , who directs the where the study was conducted , said : ' yoga is becoming an increasingly popular form of exercise in the @entity8 and it is imperative to systematically examine its health benefits , especially the mental health benefits that this unique mind - body form of activity may offer			1
' but professor @entity151 stressed it is early days for study of yoga and its effects on the body and mind			2
he said : ' we only examined the effects of a 20 - minute bout of yoga and aerobic exercise in this study among female undergraduates			0
' however , this study is extremely timely and the results will enable yoga researchers to power and design their interventions in the future			0
' we see similar promising findings among older adults as well			0
' yoga research is in its nascent stages and with its increasing popularity across the globe , researchers need to adopt rigorous systematic approaches to examine not only its cognitive but also physical health benefits across the lifespan			0

experts found a single session of @entity11 yoga improved cognitive skills
the ancient practice was compared to running on a treadmill
it is thought that breathing and meditative exercises help to calm the mind and body and keep *unhelpful* , distracting thoughts at *bay*
