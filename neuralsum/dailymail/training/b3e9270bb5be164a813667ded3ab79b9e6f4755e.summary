it is almost 75 years since they enjoyed their finest hour in the @entity3			1
and now , an @entity5 flying club has marked the momentous occasion by creating a classic @entity7 , albeit in a slightly smaller form than the @entity10 version			1
led by flying instructor @entity12 , the club hope to build a new squadron of @entity14 in time to mark the 75th anniversary of the campaign which helped @entity17 defeat @entity19 's @entity18			1
the first @entity7 - a @entity20 , a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original @entity7 design has been created by @entity23 the plane cost £ 210,000 to produce , funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £ 17,000 or £ 11,000 and was built by a team of volunteers @entity12 ( pictured ) , the manager of the project , told @entity30 : ' what 's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations			1
she 's absolutely beautiful ' mr @entity12 , 53 , has a mission and dream to build 11 more spitfires to fly a squadron down @entity39 in formation at 11am on september 15 , 2015			2
this will mark the 75th anniversary of the @entity3 in @entity10 the first @entity7 - a @entity20 , a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original @entity7 design - is now ten days away from its maiden flight			1
twenty volunteers - ranging from a @entity48 engineer to a @entity51 pilot - helped construct the first @entity7 , but more helpers are needed to build the other 11			1
@entity12 , the manager of the project , told @entity30 : ' what 's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations			0
' what has been created is remarkable and not far short of a miracle and it has spurred me on to do more			0
' mr @entity12 said : ' what we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world			0
it 's also absolutely @entity17 ' the plane weighs 810 kg and is a 90 per cent scale version of an original three - tonne @entity7 which helped @entity17 defeat @entity19 's @entity18 in the @entity3 the planes are created by a team of volunteers and funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £ 17,000 or £ 11,000 the @entity17 date the battle from 10 july to 31 october 1940 , which represented the most intense period of daylight bombing mr @entity12 , 53 , has a mission and dream to build 11 more spitfires to fly a squadron down @entity39 in formation at 11am on september 15 , 2015			1
this will mark the 75th anniversary of the @entity3 in @entity10			1
he told @entity30 : ' what we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world			0
it 's also absolutely @entity17			0
' i wanted to create something exciting and different to get people interested in flying and aeroplanes			0
' it is hoped the @entity14 , built in @entity97 , will be flown by @entity99 pilots with the @entity10 veterans in the back of the aircraft			2
mr @entity12 will ask the @entity104 @entity103 to teach the pilots who will fly the @entity14 the formation flying skills required to perform the mission			2
mr @entity12 said : ' in order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 spitfires down @entity39 next year we need a lot of money very quickly ' one of the aims of the project was to recognise the ' massive effort ' that went into creating them during @entity10 the @entity7 produced by @entity23 burns 38 litres of fuel an hour , rather than the original @entity7 which used four and half litres a minute the planes are produced by volunteers which mr @entity12 said is the ' whole ethos ' of the project			1
when completed , each plane will weigh 810 kg and will be a 90 per cent scale version of an original three - tonne @entity7 which helped @entity17 defeat @entity19 's @entity18 in the @entity3			1
mr @entity12 added : ' it 's slightly smaller and it also burns 38 litres of fuel an hour , rather than four and half litres a minute			0
it costs about £ 110 an hour to run , whereas the @entity10 planes cost between £ 2,500 and £ 3,000 to run			2
' he said the plane cost £ 210,000 to produce , funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £ 17,000 or £ 11,000			1
mr @entity12 is relying on sponsors and donations to complete the squadron			1
he needs to raise a further £ 3.7million to fulfil his dream			1
' in order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 spitfires down @entity39 next year we need a lot of money very quickly and we need to work quicker and ramp it up a bit			2
' mr @entity12 said he hoped to ' keep the @entity7 legend alive forever ' and said he first became interested in planes at the age of eight mr @entity12 said : ' i came up with the idea of the @entity7 club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying			1
i want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft ' the flying club hope to hold events across the @entity17 and in @entity161 to build up a picture of the heyday of the @entity7 seats : 1 ( but training version was two - seater ) speed : 378mph weight : 2,309kg length : 9.12m height : 11ft 5in engine : @entity171 seats : 2 speed : 200mph weight : 810kg length : 8.15m height : 7ft 1in engine : @entity179 @entity178 mr @entity12 , who said the aim was to ' keep the @entity7 legend alive forever ' , first became fascinated by flight at the age of eight when he jumped off the roof of his parents ' shed with a pair of cardboard wings strapped to his back			1
' i was n't very aerodynamic , but it certainly made me want to become a pilot			0
' i came up with the idea of the @entity7 club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying			1
' i 've found over the years that many of them give up once the excitement of learning to fly evaporates			0
' i have always been interested in military history but was always trying to find a way of bringing more people into aviation			0
it really came about by a bit of frustration and trying to find something people were really interested in and everybody loves the @entity7			2
' he also wants to make aeroplanes more ' accessible ' to enthusiasts			0
' i want to give them some hands - on experience , because having met many through the flying club , they almost seem afraid to even touch aeroplanes			2
' i want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft			0
' mr @entity12 said he hoped to stage events across @entity161			0
he said : ' we want to hold events , where the aircraft will fly in displays and be the focal point , but we also want to build up a picture of the heyday of the @entity7 , with people dressed up in 1940s gear for example			2
' he said another aim of the project was to recognise the ' massive effort ' that went into creating them during the war			0
' i have been lucky enough to meet people who were involved in the original production			0
i have met some of the design team and people who worked in production at @entity246 , in @entity247			0
some people worked there 12 hours a day , six days a week during the war and did the same job every single day			2
' the ones i have met love the spitfire we have created and it is great we have been able to recognise those people who helped produce it			0

@entity23 , in @entity5 , hope to build 12 @entity14 to mark the 75th anniversary of @entity3
the first one of the @entity14 has now been completed and is ten days away from its maiden flight
it cost £ 210,000 to produce , funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £ 17,000 or £ 11,000
