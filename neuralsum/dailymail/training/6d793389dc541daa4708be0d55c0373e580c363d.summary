by @entity0 he is fashion 's lifelong enfant terrible who created that iconic conical bra for @entity5			1
and now @entity6 is being honoured with the first major exhibition dedicated to his work in his 40 - year career			1
the @entity10 of @entity6 from the sidewalk to the catwalk is being held in @entity14 's @entity13 , and displays some of his most controversial pieces for stars such as @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
the designer said gratefully that the @entity33 capital embraced his controversial designs from the outset : ' @entity14 loved it , @entity37 did n't give a sh * *			1
' in @entity33 you say it is " no sex we are @entity43 " but that is so not true			1
it is almost the opposite in fact			1
' seated in a wheeled armchair - one of his own creations - the 61 - year - old spun around on stage as he discussed his work			1
he described discovering corsets with his grandmother as a child			1
the designer has created outfits for some of world 's most famous celebrities , including the late @entity62 - one of her ensembles , pictured far right the exhibit showcases some very original designs , such as a feathered corset for men ( left ) and a @entity69 puppet of the designer himself ( right ) ' i was going to my grandmother 's more and more			1
she was a faith healer			1
she was making beauty masks and doing tarots			1
she was telling me the same thing - " you will have a good life and be loved "			1
' she would tell women to change their hair for their husbands , it made me think how you can change the way you look			1
' one time i was there on my own and saw a corset			1
and she told me she was wearing it , during last century , and she told me she drank vinegar to contract her stomach to make her waist teeny			2
twenty years later i made a dress like that , because of that			2
' @entity6 became interested in corsets at a young age because his grandmother wore them often the conical bra became one of the designer 's signature creations at school , while the other boys played football , he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights			1
' my teacher made me put my hand out and hit me , she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade around the class			2
she wanted to humiliate me			2
but in the end , all the boys were saying " can you do a sketch for me ! "			2
' it showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and people could love me			2
so i went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and then made clothes			2
' his schoolboy dream led him to become a catwalk pioneer , introducing latex and s&m to the world of high fashion			1
@entity6 originally rejected the idea of an exhibition as he was n't sure if fashion would work in a museum the designs on show trace the evolution of @entity6 's glittering 40 - year career the designer has always been a fan of @entity142 and invited a queen elizabeth look - a - like to the opening last night known for being inspired by strong female muses , including @entity5 and @entity19 , @entity6 says he set out to change the image of women as passive , subservient characters			1
he said : ' i always found it strange that models were told to be beautiful and shut up			2
i find that very scandalous			2
i like girls to speak during the show , not to be a robot , to express themselves			2
' women were just seen as a sex object			2
i wanted them to express and i wanted a man to be a sex object too			2
' @entity6 says he was sick of women just being sex objects and that he wanted his models to express themselves on the catwalk and in photographs despite his extravagant creations , @entity6 has gained a wide celebrity following , from @entity5 to @entity167 he jokingly added : ' i think that 's happened now as you get so many cougars ... ' the controversial fashion genius originally rejected the idea of an exhibition			1
he said : ' at first i did n't want it because a museum is for when you are dead			2
and i did n't think it would work in a museum , fashion			0
' but once he got on board , he applied his notorious inventiveness to develop an original and fascinating show			0
@entity6 's classic nautical stripe also appears regularly throughout the exhibition fashion today has been swept by a wave of androgyny , with girls swapping heels for trainers , dresses for boyfriend jeans			1
' i have nothing against that			0
on the contrary , i think it is good to have it			0
' even if it looks the opposite , i am a minimalist			0
you have to be creative with a simple thing to make an effect			0
' but i try to make novelty out of things i like			0
to be honest , i do n't think i can follow the trends			0
people copy each other , i do n't think i can do that			0
for me , if you propose a different thing you can attract other people			0
if you are creating the same outfit as everyone else people will just say " why you " ? ' sex and bondage are regular themes in the designer 's work the exhibition will open to the public tomorrow and run until august this year the designer , who was heavily influenced by @entity14 's dandies , punks and @entity225 , said he has waited years to look back on his history with the city			1
he said : ' this show is like an homage to everything i love about @entity14			0
' i am super excited that the show is coming to @entity14 for two reasons			0
the first reason is that i always want to go to @entity14 , because @entity14 , for me , is a special place			0
' in @entity43 i 've got so many memories and i 've had so many experiences and the @entity43 were the first ones to come to my shows and appreciate my fashion			0
the designer was joined by many celebrities at the exhibition 's launch last night , including the heavily pregnant model @entity246 , pictured here ' i like the spirit , the humour and little adventures that were funny , like @entity225			1
' i am very proud to show it to you			0
even though i am a frog , i hope you enjoy it ! ' what 's next ? he does n't know : ' i think i 'm very lucky			1
' i did fashion because there was a 1940s movie showing couturier and i said i want to do that profession			0
he has a muse , i wanted to have a muse and do a fashion show			0
other celebrity guests included @entity266 ( left ) and hat designer @entity267 ( right ) guests were served champagne by waiters who wore the designer 's signature nautical stripe and sailor hats ' i never expected to be famous			1
' ' before i started to work i was lying a lot , inventing things that were not real to make me interesting			0
but after i tried not to lie			0
and it led me to incredible things			0
' i got to collaborate with ballet shows , @entity5 , @entity18 , directors			0
they were asking me to work with them			0
it was an honour and an adventure			0
i still love making collections			0
' i definitely want to make another show , and i do need to leave something for the next young designers			0
' the @entity10 of @entity6 from the sidewalk to the catwalk is open to the public from tomorrow until 25 august 2014 , at @entity14 's @entity13 .			1
