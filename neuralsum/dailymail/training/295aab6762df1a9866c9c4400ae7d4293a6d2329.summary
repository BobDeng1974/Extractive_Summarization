' the offender approached mr @entity1 who was facing him with his arms held out and palms open , ' she said			2
she told how @entity5 punched mr @entity1 , 24 , to the ground , and threw another punch as the young man fell , before finally moving in on the unconscious mr @entity1 and stomping hard on his chest			1
