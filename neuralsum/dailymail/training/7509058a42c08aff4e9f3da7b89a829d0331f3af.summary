@entity0 admitted on thursday that @entity1 missed out on signing ' one more player ' during the summer — something the @entity5 boss will try to rectify in january			1
the @entity5 are currently facing a severe injury crisis with nine players unavailable for saturday 's @entity9 clash against @entity10			1
but it is the defence that is most stretched with @entity13 ( achilles ) , @entity14 ( ankle ) and @entity16 ( suspended ) all missing			0
@entity0 has vowed to strengthen his squad after missing out on ' one more player ' in the summer speaking at @entity1 's @entity19 , @entity0 said : ‘ i agree we could have bought one more player but we did n’t find one			1
‘ but we will try in january to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we 've had			2
’ here @entity26 highlights seven of the defenders on @entity1 's scouting list			1
@entity29 @entity30 will sell the 21 - year - old @entity31 and have strong interest from @entity33 and @entity34 but @entity1 have the ready cash			1
valued at £ 12m , they may sell for less			0
chances : 4/5 @entity29 has fallen out of favour at @entity30 and could be available for less than £ 12million @entity39 @entity1 looked into the prospect of signing @entity41 , 23 , on transfer deadline day but could n't get a deal over the line			1
the @entity47 defender would fetch a fee of around £ 7m chances : 4/5 @entity1 attempted to sign @entity39 on transfer deadline day but could not get a deal over the line @entity53 age : 19 @entity56 defender can also play in defensive midfield which is ideal for @entity0 ’s plans			1
his contract runs out in december and he is available for nominal compensation should he leave			0
chances : 3/5 @entity53 can play also as a defensive midfielder and his versatility could appeal to @entity0 @entity64 age : 29 @entity67 defender has yet to agree to a new contract and is free in the summer			2
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 are among others monitoring his situation			0
chances : 3/5 @entity64 has been linked several clubs in recent weeks , including @entity69 and @entity71 @entity77 age : 26 @entity79 are hoping to open contract talks next week but the @entity81 looks set to see out his contract and leave on a free unless a deal can be struck			0
not top of @entity1 list but an option			1
chances : 2/5 @entity77 is out of contract in the summer and is an option for @entity1 , although he is not first choice @entity92 age : 21 @entity95 defender has been on @entity1 ’s radar since he was a teenager and club scouts watched him last week playing for @entity99 under 21			2
may not yet be at the club 's desired level			0
chances : 1/5 @entity95 's @entity92 , 21 , has been on @entity1 's radar since he was a teenager @entity103 age : 26 @entity105 want £ 17m for the @entity107 international and are unlikely to sell while in the @entity108			2
the same applies to their other defenders until next summer			0
chances : 1/5 @entity103 is the most expensive option and would depend on @entity105 's willingness to sell @entity115 to search for defensive cover			0
