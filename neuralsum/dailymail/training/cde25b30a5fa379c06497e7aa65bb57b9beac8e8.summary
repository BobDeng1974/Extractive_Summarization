by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 04:07 est , 7 february 2013 it seemed turtle was definitely on the menu when one was cornered by two giant crocodiles			0
but , incredibly , instead of becoming lunch it was allowed to bask in the hot @entity8 sun on the back of one of the predators			1
the amazing picture was taken by photographer @entity13 , who had to set up an intricate camera rig to capture the creatures in their natural habitat			1
unlikely alliance : instead of eating the turtle the alligator allows it to sit on its back as they bask in the river mr @entity13 spent four months in the stifling heat of the @entity24 tracking the animals			1
but he was unable to get the picture he wanted because the shy creatures would sink into the water when he appeared			1
so the photographer built a rig on the log to allow him to catch the animals behaving naturally			1
the high - tech camera took a picture every five minutes over two weeks so the alligators and turtles could go undisturbed			2
it was only when mr @entity13 went through the images that he realised he had caught the rare image			0
mr @entity13 said : ' i was actually nowhere in sight during this photo			0
i tried for nearly a month to make photos of this behaviour but had no luck because the alligators and turtles would just slide off into the water anytime i came near			0
on the run : the turtle looked in trouble when it was caught on the same log as the alligator in @entity8 cornered : the amphibian 's escape route is blocked by a second alligator , which do eat turtles in the wild ' so , i built i custom rig for my camera to mount atop the log and used what 's called an intervalometer to take a photo every five minutes throughout the day for two weeks			1
' every morning , i would paddle out to the log and set up the camera and then return in the evening to retrieve the camera			0
' the gators and turtles did n't mind the camera and continued to clamour for space on the prime basking spot in the swamp			2
' what was revealed was an interesting series of photographs that shows how gators and turtles interact when prime real estate is limited			0
' @entity77 alligators can grow up to 11ft and eat a range of animals and fish , including turtles and snakes .			2

@entity84 spent months tracking creatures in @entity8 swamp
used special rig to capture the animals undisturbed in natural habitat
