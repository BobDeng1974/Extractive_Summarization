pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months , official safety figures reveal			1
twelve of the cases resulted in the pilots requesting a priority landing , one flight was diverted and on two flights the pilots made an emergency @entity13 call			1
among the worst cases , one incident report in february noted : ‘ fumes in cabin			2
eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during flight , with symptoms of light - headedness , nausea and “ sea sickness ”			2
’ victim ? it is suspected @entity30 pilot @entity29 , who died in 2012 , had @entity31 the figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe for passengers and crew			1
details emerged in a report broadcast last night by @entity41 , which has seen copies of the @entity44 ’s safety reports from december 2014 to march 2015			0
these reveal 167 cases of fumes or smoke in the cabin , not attributable to faulty ovens , coffee brewers or toilets			1
in february a coroner warned that airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins			2
@entity59 coroner sheriff @entity58 said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes			2
he issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of @entity30 pilot @entity29 in 2012			0
the 43 - year - old , from @entity69 , @entity70 , had suffered years of persistent headaches , nausea and chronic fatigue , which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits			1
mr @entity58 ’s warning came days after the @entity77 revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years			2
the coroner ’s intervention was the first official recognition of @entity31 , thought to be linked to memory loss , tremors , lethargy , headaches , tinnitus , confusion , breathing difficulties and even death			0
safety questions : pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months			1
the figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe warning : @entity59 coroner sheriff @entity58 said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of those travelling on planes			1
it followed initial investigations into the death of @entity30 pilot @entity29 many former pilots , co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have suffered long - term illnesses because of the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and ‘ toxic fumes ’			1
the pilots ’ union @entity120 has raised concerns			0
since 1999 , the air industry has denied a link between ‘ fume events ’ and medical problems			0
but a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous			1
the problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines			0
passengers are usually isolated from this ‘ bleed air ’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘ organophosphates ’			0
in small quantities , these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff			0
the @entity44 said several expert studies on cabin air quality have been carried out in recent years			0
‘ the overall conclusion has been that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible long - term health effects – although such a link can not be excluded , ’ it added			1
‘ passenger and crew safety is of paramount importance to the @entity44 and we are constantly working to enhance safety standards			0

pilots reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in four months
twelve cases led pilots to request priority landing , with @entity13 call in two
