@entity3 @entity2 front - runner @entity1 's security detail led a handful of journalists on two lengthy high - speed chases to homes of influential @entity3 on monday			1
her lone official appearance on her first day in @entity9 was a carefully stage - managed small - business roundtable in @entity11			2
but a lunchtime visit to a main - street bakery and two more appointments later in the day were off - the - books and under the public 's radar			2
if police radar had been engaged , however , it would have clocked @entity1 's signature black conversion van - ' @entity20 ' , for the uninitiated – hitting 92 mph in a driving rainstorm on @entity24 , where the top speed limit is 65			2
no one in the motorcade displayed flashing lights or blasted a siren			0
the home belongs to one of @entity42 's trusted aides @entity46 : @entity34 returned to her beloved @entity20 following her afternoon house party @entity49 : @entity34 's entourage dined and partied at the home of former @entity9 state @entity53 president @entity52 @entity55 : the first photos of the custom van 's interior – complete with entertainment center ( at top left ) – were shot through the vehicle 's tinted glass at a gas station in @entity38 , @entity9 , under the watchful eye of a @entity66 agent after @entity34 emerged from @entity70 , a children 's furniture manufacturer , her black @entity68 conversion van raced an hour north to the town of @entity38 , hitting 73 in a 55 mph zone			1
two hours later @entity20 was on the move to @entity75 , bookended by a @entity66 detail that parted the puddles and kept the motorcade nose - to - tail – with the caboose car slamming on the brakes time and again			0
the @entity38 event took @entity34 to the home of @entity84 , a constituent services ' special assistant ' to @entity9 @entity3 sen. @entity42			1
@entity84 is not a @entity87 heavy - hitter , but is part of @entity42 's inner circle			0
a political operative close to @entity42 's @entity9 office said the meeting was meant to include a discussion about nudging the senator toward a presidential endorsement			1
in the nation 's first presidential primary voting state , an early nod from a sitting senator to a former senator could carry enough weight to ward off @entity34 's potential competitors			1
@entity84 did not respond to phone messages seeking comment , and @entity34 's campaign made arrangements only for the @entity107 to attend			2
scooby sightings : on monday the @entity34 campagin - mobile made stops in three @entity9 towns @entity112 : @entity20 's @entity66 driver gassed up @entity1 's chariot before opening up her engine and pushing it to 92 mph meet molly : @entity34 enjoyed the oldest campaign tactic in the book – posing with a baby – on monday in the @entity9 town of @entity11 , and gushed that she wanted to bring the infant home with her in @entity38 , according to tweets from a @entity107 reporter , the wealthy former secretary of state 's messaging featured progressive - friendly lines about income inequality			1
' the deck is stacked in their favor , ' she said of @entity133 's super-rich			0
' my job is to reshuffle the cards			0
' @entity34 and her husband , the former president , are themselves among @entity133 's much - derided ' one per cent ' richest			2
she also sounded an alarm about capital gains tax cuts for big banks being the ' root ' of @entity133 's economic malaise			0
that seems calibrated to appeal to @entity3 on her left flank – those who are pining for @entity151 sen. @entity150 to enter the race			0
@entity34 's @entity75 stop was a 7:00 dinner event at the sprawling home of former @entity9 state @entity53 president @entity52			1
good night 's rest : @entity34 and her traveling campaign team stayed monday night at the @entity162 hotel , a @entity164 property full of ' boutique furniture pieces and chic art taken from the pages of @entity168 ' @entity169 : @entity170 , @entity1 's right - hand woman , is on the campaign trail and stayed by @entity34 's side as they stopped at a bakery in @entity11 on monday @entity174 is a longtime @entity34 loyalist who endorsed @entity1 's first presidential bid in 2007			1

that house is steeped in @entity34 lore			0
when then - governor @entity34 filed his papers to run in the 1992 @entity9 primary , it was @entity1 who delivered the documents to the state capitol			1
her last stop before making that trek in the rain was a gathering of professional women at @entity174 's home			1
