by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 could be facing a @entity4 nightmare draw on thursday , with a group containing @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 a possibility			1
the @entity10 are only in pot three after a five - year absence from the competition , and so will be pitted against the continent 's heavyweights			0
the best case scenario for @entity2 would be a group containing @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 or @entity21			2
pot 1 : @entity6 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity18 pot 2 : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity7 , @entity31 , @entity19 , @entity32 , @entity33 pot 3 : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity2 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 pot 4 : @entity41 , @entity8 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 new signing : @entity47 will hope to inspire @entity2 to @entity4 glory this season champions : the galacticos of @entity6 are the @entity4 holders and could face @entity2 old boy : @entity2 could be drawn in a group with @entity22 , which would mean a reunion with @entity55 glory days : @entity2 last won the @entity4 in 2005 , and are desperate to win the trophy again dare to @entity58 : @entity7 , led by @entity58 , are the strongest side in pot two should @entity2 avoid @entity6 , they would still be paired in a group with one of the top seeds , including @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity26			1
a group with @entity22 would mean a possible return to @entity66 for controversial striker @entity55			0
@entity2 failed to make it out of the group when they were last in the competition , in 2009 - 10 , and will be hoping for as kind a draw as possible to help them progress			0
@entity72 : @entity8 , captained by @entity73 , are in pot four and look to be a team to avoid outclassed : @entity2 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity33 on monday and will need to improve video we 'll get better and better - @entity77			2

@entity2 are in pot three and could face @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8
the @entity10 could also be drawn with @entity55 's new team @entity22
the best case scenario would be a group with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20
the draw is made on thursday *afternoon*
@entity2 were last in the competition in the 2009/10 season
