@entity0 will die taking a bullet for his gay best friend			2
the famous freckle - faced comic book icon is meeting his demise in wednesday 's installment of ' life with @entity0 ' when he intervenes in an assassination attempt on @entity9 , @entity10 ' first openly gay character			1
@entity0 ' death , which was first announced in april , will mark the conclusion of the series that focuses on grown - up renditions of @entity0 and his @entity17 pals			1
he dies in the manner that epitomizes not only the best of @entity17 but the best of all of us			2
it 's what @entity0 has come to represent over the past almost 75 years			0
' @entity9 's character first joined @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 in the @entity10 spin - off ' @entity36 ' in 2010			2
he later appeared in his own solo title			0
in ' life with @entity0 , ' @entity9 is a married military veteran and newly elected senator who 's pushing for more gun control in @entity17 after his husband was involved in a shooting			1
' we wanted to do something that was impactful that would really resonate with the world and bring home just how important @entity0 is to everyone , ' said @entity27			0
' that 's how we came up with the storyline of saving @entity9			0
he could have saved @entity54			0
he could have saved @entity36			0
we get that , but metaphorically , by saving @entity9 , a new @entity17 is born			0
' courageous act : @entity0 's death will mark the end of the ' @entity60 ' series which focuses on the grown - up versions of the @entity17 characters			1
however , he will continue to exist in the other @entity0 comics end of an era : @entity0 is just one of many high - profile comic book characters to be killed off in recent years , joining @entity67 ' @entity66 and @entity70 ' @entity69 ' @entity68 who shot @entity0 ? @entity27 is n't spoiling the killer , only teasing it 's a stalker who wanted to take @entity9 down			1
@entity0 's final moments will be detailed in ' life with @entity0 ' no. 36 , while issue @entity77 will jump forward a year and focus on the @entity17 gang honoring the legacy of their red - headed pal , who first appeared in comics in 1941 and went on to become a colorful icon of wholesomeness			1
other incarnations of @entity0 will continue to live on in @entity10 series			1
in recent years , deaths of high - profile comic book characters like @entity67 ' @entity66 and @entity70 ' @entity69 ' @entity68 have made headlines and garnered intense reaction from fans			2
@entity27 notes that @entity0 ' passing is n't just a publicity stunt but also a lesson about gun violence and a declaration of diversity in the new age of @entity10			1
' @entity0 is not a superhero like all the rest of the comic book characters , ' said @entity27			1
when you wound him , he bleeds			0
if anything , i think his death is more impactful because of that			0
we hope by showing how something so violent can happen to @entity0 , that we can — in some way — learn from him			0
