we know the @entity39 is difficult and anything can happen , ' @entity20 said after @entity0 beat @entity46 2 - 0 in its last warm - up game			1
ahead of the team 's arrival , an @entity9 federation official had a greeting put up on the gate of the team base in @entity54 saying ' welcome future champions			1
' he acknowledged that some players , including @entity20 , were n't thrilled by the triumphalism , and the sign was quickly removed			2
