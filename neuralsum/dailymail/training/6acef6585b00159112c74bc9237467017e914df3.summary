by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 political editor a @entity6 state school where most children are brought up with @entity8 as a foreign language offers a better education than the private school attended by @entity12 and @entity13 just around the corner , @entity4 claimed today			1
the @entity15 vowed to ‘ break down the @entity16 ’ between state and private schools to drive up standards			2
and he claimed the @entity21 primary school in @entity6 is now better than the £ 17,460 - a - year @entity22 which taught the heirs to the throne			2
prince @entity12 and prince @entity13 in april 1990 being dropped off by mother @entity25 at @entity26 , which education secretary @entity27 says is now matched by nearby state schools @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity6 , is regularly cited by politicians for its strong performance in a tough area in speech to the @entity35 today , mr @entity4 said the evidence shows ‘ beyond any reasonable doubt ’ that @entity8 state education is starting to show a ‘ sustained and significant improvement ’			1
he said state schools could become the best in the world by tapping into the expertise of the independent sector			2
but he went further in claiming that @entity46 school in particular may already have been overtaken by nearby state schools teaching much poorer pupils			1
@entity12 and @entity13 both attended the prep school in @entity30 in the 1980s before taking up places at @entity50			1
other former @entity46 pupils include @entity53 creator @entity52 , composer @entity54 and actor @entity55			1
mr @entity4 said he wanted to make it impossible to tell if a school is private or state - run mr @entity4 insisted that the expensive and exclusive education on offer there was now matched by state schools ‘ every bit as good as excellent private schools ’			1
he added : ‘ there are state primary schools every bit as ambitious , as supportive , as exciting , as the smartest of private prep schools			1
‘ like , for example , @entity21 primary in @entity6 – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years , a majority coming from homes where @entity8 is not their first language – which is just as good , if not better , than the pre-eminent @entity6 prep - @entity46 school - just a mile or so away			1
‘ under the changes we 're making , it ’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools			2
‘ instead of reinforcing the @entity16 between state and private , as the current @entity89 leadership appear to want , we should break it down			0
’ mr @entity4 was speaking at the @entity35 , a new free school in @entity92 , @entity93 , which has managed to secure places in @entity95 and @entity96 for six of its pupils – the same number achieved last year by @entity100 , an independent school that charges annual fees of up to £ 32,385			2
the education secretary also wants state schools to make pupils sit the ‘ robust ’ common entrance exam used by leading private schools and subject them to old - fashioned classroom discipline			1
he suggests that all 13 - year - olds should study for the 100 - year - old test to indicate how well they are ‘ performing against some of the top schools around the world ’			2
mr @entity4 argues that it is wrong that between national curriculum tests at age 11 and gcses at 16 , children have no formal , externally assessed examinations			2
founded in 1951 , it was originally in upmarket @entity122 before moving to @entity123 in 1971			0
former pupils include prince @entity12 , prince @entity13 , @entity55 , lord @entity54			0
uniform : @entity126 and red blazers and caps number of pupils : 244 age of pupils : 4 - 8 gender of pupils : boys fees : £ 17,460 - a - year named after a 19th century campaigner against slavery from @entity140 , twothirds of pupils use @entity8 as an additional language , and one third of these speak @entity144 as their first language			2
uniform : blue sweatshirts and cardigans number of pupils : 235 gender of pupils : mixed age of pupils : 3 - 11 fees : £ 0 mr @entity4 wants state school pupils to take the exams used by private schools to drive up standards he also urged head teachers to go further by adopting traditional methods of discipline			1
new guidance being sent to schools today sets out suggested punishments for misbehaving students , including being sent for a run around a playing field , picking up litter or writing out hundreds of lines			0
it also suggests that detentions can be issued at lunchtime , after school or weekends , with no notice for parents			0
mr @entity4 said that his ambition for the education system is ‘ simple ... when you visit a school in @entity181 , standards are so high all round that you should not be able to tell whether it ’s in the state sector or a fee - paying independent ’			1
he argued that the state education system is ‘ starting to show a sustained and significant improvement ’			0
but he warned schools must go further – setting out his proposal for 13 - year - olds to sit the common entrance exam			1
‘ privately educated children often benefit from rigorous testing of ability – and , crucially , knowledge – at regular points throughout their school career , ’ mr @entity4 said			0
‘ but since the last @entity89 government abolished tests for 14 - year - olds , we have had no rigorous externally set and marked measures of progress for students in the first five years of secondary school			1
‘ it is often during this period that performance dips and students suffer			0
‘ i am open to arguments about how we can improve performance – and assessment – in this critical period			0
' but there is already one widely available , robust and effective test of knowledge for just this age group : the common entrance test papers			0
‘ they are designed for 13 - year - olds – they are used by private schools to ensure students are on track for later success – they are already available on the web , and are a fantastic resource			0
‘ so i want state schools to try out @entity227 exams – giving them a chance to check how well they and their pupils are performing against some of the top schools around the world			1
’ there is , however , no suggestion that taking the @entity227 test will provide a path into private schools			0
on discipline , mr @entity4 said every head in the state sector must have the ability to ensure children behave as ‘ impeccably as in the most successful state and private schools ’			1
he added : ‘ that means giving heads the power to ensure there is exemplary behaviour – and giving teachers the power to keep control in the classroom and the playground			0
' because without excellent behaviour , no child can learn – and a tiny minority of disruptive children can absorb almost all of teachers ’ time and attention , in effect holding the education of the rest hostage			0
‘ so we have given teachers more freedoms to keep control in the classroom , and to discipline pupils for misbehaviour			0
‘ we trust the professionalism of our teachers			0
so we ’ve given them the tools to keep control of their classrooms , and allow every student to learn in peace			0
’ exams will test how pupils are getting along compared to other schools , and will not be used to give out places the @entity282 said while current guidelines make clear the legal backing for setting school punishments , they fail to outline potential sanctions , leaving many heads and teachers unclear of what action they can take			1
mr @entity4 also suggested he wanted to see more state schools offer extra-curricular activities to extend the school day to fit in with the lives of working parents			1
he said he did not support shorter holidays but said free schools and academies could vary term dates to allow parents to avoid the expense of holidaying during rigidly fixed half terms and other holidays .			0

education secretary says state school now better than @entity46 prep
he wants all school children to sit exams used by @entity50 and @entity311
pupils should also be subjected to more old - style punishments
the tests would be to gauge progress , not to win entry to schools
