a female @entity1 astronaut has shared the hair - raising experience of getting a salon trim while floating through space			1
in a video uploaded to @entity7 , @entity9 - born @entity8 , 37 , is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander @entity12			1
as her short dark crop is trimmed into shape , she uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters			1
she also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment			0
an ' after ' photograph of the salon session shows it was a success , with no strands out of place or chunks missing			1
@entity12 , 47 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , joked that he could be gearing up for a ' second career after astronaut '			1
they are set to return to @entity43 on may 14			0
to date the clip of their hairdressing antics has been watched more than 50,000 times			0
many fans have thanked them for sharing the behind - the - scenes footage			2
it 's not the first time @entity54 has cut @entity8 's hair			1
on january 1 he gave the flight engineer a trim to ring in the @entity60 , with photographs uploaded to @entity62			0
luckily her short hair is easy to manage but female astronauts with longer locks often find ' bad hair days ' are part of the job			2
in 2013 , @entity69 revealed how it was difficult to wash her long blonde hair in space			2
the mechanical engineer was on board @entity74 to the @entity39 at the time			1
in a video uploaded to @entity62 ms @entity69 was seen placing water on to her scalp , battling with a few escaping bubbles			0
smooth hair : a head shot of @entity8 before her space mission perfect cut : an ' after ' photograph of the salon session ( right ) , shows it was a success , with no strands out of place or chunks missing two person job : as her short dark crop is trimmed into shape , @entity8 uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters - she also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment she then worked leave - in shampoo through her hair			1
it was seen stood on its end as she worked a comb through it			0
her tools were stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping			2
to finish , she towel - dried her head dry			2
she claimed the results left her barnet feeling ' squeaky clean ' for men , shaving is the same as it is on @entity43			0
although , again , they use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away			1
elsewhere on the grooming front , astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity , there is a limited supply of water on the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) - no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water			1

in space , astronauts use a no - rinse shampoo to wash their hair , and apply the shampoo using a towel , vigorously rub their hair and scalp			1
they then use a towel to wipe their hair clean			0
the reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs do n't float around the station			1
' astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts ' eyes , ' explained the @entity157			1
' loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration			2
' shaving in space is similar to shaving on @entity43 ; astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air , like with a haircut			2
astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor , but most are said to prefer the latter , because it does n't require water and automatically collects hair			0
and , no water is wasted , because as it dries on a person 's head , it is collected by the air conditioning system , which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water			0
space woman : it 's not the first time @entity54 has cut @entity8 's hair - on january 1 he gave a trim to ring in the @entity60 , with photographs uploaded to @entity62 welcome to the space gym : along with keeping her grooming in check , @entity8 also works out twice a day in space , astronauts use a no - rinse shampoo to wash their hair , and apply the shampoo using a towel , vigorously rub their hair and scalp			1

other @entity7 videos show her in the ' space gym ' doing rowing pulls , shoulder presses and squats			0
as their bodies are not working against the force of gravity , astronauts exert little effort to get around			0
therefore , they face bone density and muscle loss if they do n't keep their fitness levels in check during missions			0
to enable them to use gym equipment in zero - g , they wear harnesses and bungee straps			0
@entity8 says training and nutrition is very important to her while working in such tough conditions .			2

@entity9 - born @entity8 , 37 , is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander @entity12
the duo are currently on a six - month mission with @entity38 to the @entity39
as her short dark crop is trimmed into shape , @entity8 uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters
an ' after ' photograph of the salon session shows it was a success
