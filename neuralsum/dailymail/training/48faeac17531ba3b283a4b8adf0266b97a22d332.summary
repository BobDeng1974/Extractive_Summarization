the body of a notorious criminal who confessed to being ' the @entity3 ' will be dug up this week so scientists can prove beyond any doubt that he raped and murdered 19 - year - old @entity7 in 1964 after an incredible breakthrough in the cold case			1
it was widely thought @entity7 was the last of 11 women murdered by the @entity3 nearly 50 years ago after @entity12 confessed to the killings , and an additional two murders , in the 1960s			1
but he was never prosecuted			0
authorities today revealed they believe with 99.9 per cent certainty that @entity12 , who was stabbed to death in @entity20 state prison in november 1973 , was the killer after semen found on @entity7 's body and on a blanket discovered nearby was linked to him			1
while similar dna evidence is unavailable for the other 10 victims , if found guilty of slaying @entity7 , it strongly suggests @entity12 was the @entity3 , as per his confession , because of the blinding similarities in the murders			1
detectives with the @entity42 then conducted undercover surveillance of @entity12 's family members and retrieved a discarded water bottle from one of the man 's nephews			2
they tested dna from fingerprints and it proved a familial similarity to the dna found on the victim			2
@entity12 's body , which has been buried for some 40 years , will be exhumed this week and his remains will be sent to the chief medical examiner 's office where dna samples will be collected and sent off for testing			1
results should prove once and for all whether he murdered @entity7			0
@entity61 district attorney @entity60 , @entity63 police commissioner @entity62 and attorney general @entity64 announced the ' major development ' at a press conference this morning and officials met with relatives of the women murdered by the @entity70 today			0
@entity62 said : ' the ability to provide closure to a family after fifty years is just a remarkable thing			0
' @entity12 can not be charged but the authorities hoped the breakthrough would bring closure to at least the @entity7 family , some five decades after their loved one was senselessly murdered			2
victims : this picture shows eight of the women strangled to death in the spree			0
from top left to bottom right : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , mrs. @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , mrs. @entity96 killed : @entity12 was stabbed to death in prison in 1973 , aged 42 before his death , @entity12 , a blue collar worker and @entity100 veteran who was married with children , admitted he was the @entity3 who terrorized the greater @entity63 area in the 1960s , killing 11 women			1
but he was never prosecuted for the heinous crimes , according to the @entity108 , because of a deal negotiated with then - attorney general @entity110 and @entity12 's attorney , @entity111			2
he was brutally murdered in prison , aged 42 , while serving a life sentence for armed robbery and sexual assault in a separate series of ' non-fatal ' attacks on women			1
authorities said today that no dna evidence exists for any of the @entity70 's 10 other victims			2
this means that a similar definitive link is unlikely in those cases			0
until now , @entity12 's confession was the only evidence in the fascinating case , allowing room for the community , and even some high up in the police department , to doubt whether he was in fact responsible			1
as recently as 2012 , @entity134 cast doubt over whether @entity12 was in fact the @entity3			1
' even to this day , i ca n't say with certainty that the person who ultimately was designated as the @entity3 was the @entity3 , ' @entity134 told the @entity108 last year			0
@entity12 's surviving relatives and @entity141 , the nephew of @entity7 , organized dna testing a decade ago on @entity7 's remains but the technology at the time meant it was not possible to get a usable sample			1
at that point , authorities decided to halt testing , which destroys the evidence , until advancements in technology were strong enough to get a result			0
family : in this undated black and white file photo , @entity156 , left , and son @entity141 hold a photo in @entity158 , @entity159 , of @entity156 's sister @entity7 , who was found strangled in january 1964 and is believed to have been the last victim of the @entity3 those breakthroughs occured last year and the cold case was reopened with two of six remaining semen samples sent to two difficent labs			1
both came back with the same results			0
a sample from @entity7 's body showed the unique genetic profile of two people - the teen herself and a white male - while a sample from a blanket showed dna of the same white male			1
police then searched high and low for anything that would still have @entity12 's dna on it			2
they attempted to get a sample from a pair of letters he wrote to the parole board but failed			0
however , thanks to the new technology they knew they could use dna from one of @entity191 's male descendents instead as the y chromosomes among men of the same family are as good as identical			2
@entity195 , a 55 - year - old @entity196 seamstress , was the @entity3 's first victim			1
she was found dead in her @entity198 apartment by her son on june 14 , 1962			0
the teen had moved from her @entity203 home to @entity63 just three days before her death			0
@entity12 was pinpointed as the killer when he confessed to the string of strangling deaths to his cellmate , @entity208			0
confession : factory worker @entity12 , who was married and had children , told police he was behind the killings @entity208 told @entity12 's defense lawyer @entity111 , who struck a deal with @entity134 which outlined that @entity12 would n't be prosecuted if he admitted he was the @entity3			1
at his robbery and sexual assault trial in 1967 , @entity111 said @entity12 was consumed by ' one of the most crushing sexual drives that psychiatric science has ever encountered			1
' thirteen acts of homicide by a completely uncontrollable vegetable walking around in a human body , ' he said in opening his defense , according to the @entity108 archives			0
his psychiatrist , dr. @entity227 , testified that he was suffering from ' schizophrenia of the paranoid type			0
' he said each of @entity12 's alleged slaying would be preceded by a night during which would be tormented ' with a burning up inside ... like little fires			2
' according to the article , dr. @entity227 testified that @entity12 told him he killed his victims with nylon stockings			1
' he tied the victims up usually with scarves or stockings , the stockings being the terminal means by which , though unconsciousness had of course , ensured , the terminal means by which life ended , ' he said			0
he added the victims were tied ' in a frog - like position , ' and that @entity12 had relations with the dead or unconscious body			1
jan. 4 , 1964 – @entity7 , 19 , the last of the 11 victims , found murdered in her apartment in the @entity257 section of @entity63			1

dec. 6 , 2001 – forensic scientists announce that dna evidence taken from @entity7 's body does not match @entity12 's @entity267			1
dec. 24 , 2001 – judge says state does n't need to share forensic evidence with the @entity191 and @entity7 families because the investigation into the killings remains open			2
july 11 , 2013 – @entity61 district attorney @entity60 says advances in dna technology have allowed investigators to link @entity12 to @entity7 's killing			1
@entity60 says the dna produced a " familial match " with @entity12 , and he expects an exact match once @entity12 's remains are re-exhumed .			0

@entity12 confessed to the killings but was never prosecuted
@entity303 found on the body of @entity7 , 19 , who was thought to be the @entity3 's final victim in 1964 , was tested and showed dna believed to belong to @entity191
@entity12 was stabbed to death in prison in 1973 , aged 42 , while serving a life sentence for robbery and sexual assault
authorities are digging up his body this week to prove beyond any doubt that his @entity267 matches the sample and is guilty in the slaying
if proven guilty , it strongly suggests he was in fact the @entity3 , as per his confession
man strangled victims with nylon stockings then tied them in ' frog - like ' positions and ' had relations ' with their dead or unconscious bodies
