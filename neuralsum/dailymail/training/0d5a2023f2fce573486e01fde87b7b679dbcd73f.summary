by @entity0 ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants ’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from @entity8			2
the new push , which could see unemployed @entity11 nationals kicked out of the country after just six months , was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the @entity8 surge in last week ’s elections			1
currently , new arrivals can not claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can			1
unemployment : ministers announced new plans to crackdown on migrants ' access to benefits			2
but with most @entity11 migrants in work and not claiming , it would most likely have little effect on soaring net migration figures yesterday home secretary @entity33 confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months			1
and work and pensions secretary @entity38 told @entity39 it would be ‘ bye bye ’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the @entity42			2
however , the policy faces opposition from the @entity46 , who are yet to sign off on the idea			1
critics claimed the policy would have little impact on @entity52 ’s drive to reduce net migration below 100,000 before the next election , as it would have no effect on the tens of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work			1
and questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of unemployed @entity11 nationals being removed from the @entity42 when ministers struggle to throw out foreign criminals			1
crackdown : : home secretary @entity33 yesterday confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months despite concern about the rise of @entity8 , mr @entity52 appears to have escaped the harsh criticism from backbenchers that has dogged @entity74 and @entity75 since thursday			1
yesterday the only murmurings of discontent came from former shadow home secretary @entity78 , who called on mr @entity52 to bring forward by a year to 2016 the proposed referendum on membership of the @entity11			1
he said the current policy lacked ‘ clarity and credibility ’			0
and he criticised the government ’s failure to bring immigration ‘ back under control ’			0
he wrote : ‘ the conservative party has to decide pretty soon where its blue lines are and make them very clear			0
if we do not grasp this nettle , i can see the @entity8 resurgence carrying all the way through to the @entity94			0
’ a poll carried out by conservative peer @entity96 in marginal seats , suggested @entity99 had a comfortable 12 - point lead over the @entity101 and showed there was still strong support for @entity8			0
the survey of key ‘ swing ’ seats put @entity99 at 41 per cent , the @entity101 on 29 and @entity8 was on 18 per cent			0
if repeated next year it could hand @entity74 a comfortable majority			0
defence secretary @entity109 said he believed most of those who voted @entity8 at the local and @entity112 elections last week were ‘ lender voters ’ who would return to the @entity101 for the @entity94 next year			0
he told @entity115 the government had to address ‘ specific concerns ... about immigration and about @entity112 ’			0
he added : ‘ @entity8 is a protest party ; most of the people who are voting for @entity8 – not all of them , but most of them – are disillusioned voters of other parties who moved to @entity8 to send us a message and we ’ve got a year to show that we ’ve got that message			0
’ curbs : @entity129 migrants sleeping rough on the central reservation of @entity131 , central @entity132 good show : @entity8 leader @entity134 , celebrates with newly elected councillors in @entity136 on saturday after his party 's local election successes @entity140 sources dismissed mr @entity78 ’s call to move the referendum forward , saying it would n’t make the ‘ slightest difference on the doorstep ’			2
however , mr @entity109 said ministers would try to resurrect a proposal to enshrine the @entity11 referendum pledge in law			1
' grasp the nettle ' : @entity151 backbencher @entity78 called on @entity52 to bring the proposed referendum on @entity11 membership forward to 2016 mrs may accepted it had ‘ become more difficult ’ for ministers to hit their target of cutting net migration – the number of people arriving minus those departing - to below 100,000 by the time of the next election			1
last week figures showed a sharp increase in arrivals from the @entity11 made that target a distant prospect			2
but she said should would ‘ continue working to bring it down ’			0
she also indicated the proposals on benefits were facing opposition from the @entity46			1
at the moment arrivals have three months to try and find work during which they can not claim benefits , followed by six in which they can			2
she added : ‘ we have n't yet got agreement across the coalition to do that			2
but these are the sorts of measures we keep looking at because in immigration you can never stand still			0
’ ‘ it is no surprise to anybody that there have been some long - standing , possibly heated at times , discussions among the coalition on some of these issues of immigration			0
’ the effect of the change would be to halve the length of time when migrants can claim benefits in @entity42 from six months to three			1
however , there were immediately questions about the likelihood of large numbers being removed from the country even if they were n’t working			0
even if it was implemented , such a policy would have little difference on overall numbers of migrants because most @entity11 immigrants do not claim benefits and are in work .			1

new proposals could kick unemployed @entity11 migrants out after six months
but it faces opposition from the @entity46 , who have to sign off
unlikely to have big impact on migration as most @entity11 migrants do n't claim
