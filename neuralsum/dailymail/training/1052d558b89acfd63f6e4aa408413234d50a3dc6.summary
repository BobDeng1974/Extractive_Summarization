climbing trees , chasing mice , showing off to the ladies			0
four legs were always handy for @entity4 the cat			2
when @entity4 was three , the handsome grey @entity7 was run over by a car and lost his left hind leg			1
he happily carried on with three , thanks to a £ 3,500 series of operations that stitched up the damage and made the best of his front left paw , which was also injured in the crash			1
but four months ago he developed a malignant growth on the repaired front leg			1
his owner @entity36 , 58 , could n't bear to have him put down or put him through the pain of chemotherapy with no guarantee of success			0
so she pleaded @entity42 reports ' he does n't seem bothered at all ' for option three – amputating the leg , leaving him with only two , both on the right side			1
when her vet sought opinions from four colleagues , all said it should n't be done			0
they insisted he would be unable to walk and his life would not be worth living			2
caring : @entity4 with his best friend and neighbour @entity55 pain : the unlucky moggie was forced to have his leg amputated recently , which left him with no limbs on one side well , @entity4 , take a bow			1
and a run around the garden			2
and just for good measure , try a ballet - style pirouette			0
although he was expected to spend weeks recovering at home in @entity70 , @entity71 , within days he had achieved near perfect balance – helped by next door neighbour @entity55 , eight , who joined the campaign to nurse him back to health			0
and less than two months after the £ 4,000 operation , he is skipping along like a cat on a hot tin roof			1
' everyone who sees him is astonished at what he can do , ' mrs @entity36 said			0
' he does n't seem bothered at all by having only two legs			0

black @entity7 lost his left hind leg some ten years ago after being run over by a car aged three
after £ 3,500 worth of operations , he battled on with his life
the tragedy struck four months ago when he was forced to have his front left leg amputated
another £ 4,000 operation and the *fearless* *feline* is still *bounding* about despite having no left - side legs
