by @entity0 an @entity2 soldier accused of strangling his pregnant wife during a sex game so he could pocket $ 500,000 in insurance and benefit money , was convicted thursday by a military judge			1
the case hinged on dueling medical experts who could n't agree on how the woman died			0
pvt. @entity11 , 22 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , was on trial for four days during a @entity16 court - martial			1
he was convicted of murder and causing the death of an unborn child after his wife , 24 - year - old sgt. @entity20 , was found dead at their apartment july 17 , 2011 , when she was about seven months pregnant			1
the charges carry an automatic life sentence			0
money trail : an ex-girlfriend of pvt. @entity11 , pictured at his preliminary hearing on august 30 , 2012 , testified that the soldier told her to expect ' a lot of money ' just hours before his wife was suffocated to death leaving him to collect $ 500,000 in insurance expectant mother : sgt. @entity36 , 24 ( pictured left and right in 2011 ) was seven months pregnant when she was found dead july 17 , 2011 , with abrasions on her wrists in her bedroom strewn with sex toy the verdict should have little impact on @entity11 's overall fate			1
he 's already serving life without parole at a @entity47 prison after pleading guilty last summer to murder charges in a double slaying that occurred nearly five months after his wife died			1
prosecutors had no problem presenting a possible motive for why @entity11 would want his wife dead			2
the @entity2 paid him $ 100,000 to cover funeral costs and other expenses after his wife died , and a month later her life insurance policy paid out $ 400,000			1
the court heard how @entity11 's rocky marriage and the hefty insurance payout prompted him to kill his wife , who was about seven months pregnant			1
a former @entity2 buddy testified earlier this week that @entity11 told him that he handcuffed his wife during sex and suffocated her by putting a plastic bag over her head			1
evidence showed that hours before his wife died , @entity11 sent a text message to a former girlfriend that read : ' we 'll have plenty of money			1
all need is your body whenever i want it			0
' but evidence of what specifically killed @entity20 proved scant			2
the military 's autopsy found more than 20 bruises and scrapes on the body including on her head and back , but nothing fatal			0
wounds on both wrists appeared to match a pair of handcuffs found on the couple 's bed			2
@entity11 ( right ) , pictured here in 2011 with his co-defendant @entity91 ( left ) , is already serving a sentence of life without parole in a @entity47 state prison after he pleaded guilty last year in a double slaying @entity11 told them he had woken up from a nap to find his wife dead on the couch			1
paramedics found marks on her wrists , but no other obvious wounds			0
military police found a pair of handcuffs on the couple 's bed , along with a number of other sex toys scattered around the room			1
@entity11 told them he had cuffed his wife during consensual sex earlier in the evening , before he nodded off for a nap , said @entity114 , the @entity2 's lead investigator on the case			1
' he stated that she enjoyed being tied up and that night they used the handcuffs , ' @entity114 said			0
' he said she enjoyed having her hands behind her back and laying on the handcuffs			0
' but the official cause of death was not determined			0
the military could n't decide whether she had been slain or died from natural causes			0
last year , a @entity47 state medical examiner offered a second opinion			0
by ruling out illnesses , drugs or poisons , allergic reactions and other potential causes â € ” and by noting the wrist wounds and other injuries â € ” dr. @entity128 concluded @entity20 was strangled while struggling violently against handcuffs behind her back			2
he said a certain chokehold taught to @entity2 soldiers could kill while leaving virtually no telltale marks			2
' that 's why this is such a great way to kill someone if you want to get away with it , ' @entity2 prosecutor @entity140 said in her closing argument			2
' you put this hold on someone and it could leave almost no finding			0
' @entity11 did n't testify during the trial			2
the defense 's only witness was its medical expert			0
high stakes ; @entity11 , seen in court in july 2013 , now faces the rest of his life in jail after being convicted of killing his wife defense lawyers noted in closing arguments that the military medical examiner and three additional specialists who took part in the autopsy were unable to find a decisive cause of death as @entity128 had			1
another medical expert called by the defense said it was more likely @entity20 suffered a sudden heart attack , though prosecutors insisted his diagnosis was based on a faulty reading of her medical history			2
radicalized : @entity11 , pictured at the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity177 , allegedly founded an anti-government militia group called @entity179 ' all the government has presented here today is one man 's theory that is no more possible than any other possibility that no other doctor could rule out , ' said capt. @entity185 , one of @entity11 's @entity2 defense lawyers			1
a former @entity2 buddy , @entity187 , testified that a month after his wife 's death , @entity11 gloated that he had handcuffed her during sex and strangled her with a plastic bag over her head			1
defense attorneys noted that @entity187 , who had spoken to @entity2 investigators and testified previously at a pre-trial hearing , had never before mentioned a confession			2
@entity11 told investigators his wife liked to have her hands bound during sex and that she wore the handcuffs consensually			2
the judge , col. @entity199 , deliberated about three hours before convicting @entity11			0
the soldier showed no visible emotion as the verdict was read			0
as the judge heard testimony before sentencing , @entity20 's parents said they and their six surviving children are still grieving nearly three years later			0
when one of their daughters married recently , the family left an empty seat for @entity20			0
" one of the hardest questions for me still is how many children do you have , " said @entity211 , the slain woman 's father			0
" how do you answer that ? i still do n't know			0
" last july , @entity11 pleaded guilty in the december 2011 slayings of former soldier @entity221 and his girlfriend , @entity222 , who were shot in the head in rural @entity224 near @entity16			1
more victims : @entity221 , 19 ( left ) and his girlfriend @entity222 , 17 ( right ) were found shot in the head in december 2011 to stop them from revealing @entity179 's illegal activities combination photo of @entity11 ( @entity227 , top row ) , @entity230 , @entity231 ( @entity232 , bottom row ) and @entity91 pictured in this @entity224 , @entity47 , @entity234 booking photograph civilian prosecutors say @entity11 used the money from his wife 's insurance policy to fund an anti-government militia group of disgruntled soldiers and ordered the couple killed to protect the group			1
records show he bought at least $ 30,000 worth of guns and ammunition			0
@entity2 prosecutors never mentioned the militia allegations and said @entity11 wanted the insurance money and the weapons to start a private security business .			1
