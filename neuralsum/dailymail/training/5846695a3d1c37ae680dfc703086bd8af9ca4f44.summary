’ the average price of a litre of petrol is currently £ 1.32			2
the number of refineries in @entity5 has fallen to seven from 22 in 1973			1

@entity134 , who lost his job as @entity11 secretary in the recent cabinet reshuffle , said closure would be an ‘ act of industrial vandalism ’			0

@entity65 says closure *reflects* concerns in the refining industry
rise would be caused by @entity5 having to rely on *imported* fuel
