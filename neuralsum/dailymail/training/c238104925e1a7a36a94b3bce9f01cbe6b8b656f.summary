@entity0 stands poised on saturday night between the pinnacle of a mega-fight with world heavyweight supremo @entity3 and the abyss of absurdly premature retirement , at just 26			1
the giant @entity7 traveller can nail down a multi-world title challenge to @entity3 with an impressive victory over @entity10 at @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
alternatively , @entity0 is vowing to hang up the gloves if he loses to his little - known and lightly - regarded @entity15 opponent			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity10 had to be pulled apart as they clashed at the weigh - in on friday the prospect of @entity0 being granted his wish of taking on @entity3 , the long - time holder of all but one of the heavyweight belts , will be strengthened by the presence at ringside of @entity26 tv mogul @entity25			1
the president of sports for the giant @entity30 cable tv network has flown to @entity12 to evaluate the box office potential of @entity32			2
@entity25 comes to town just as promoter @entity34 has agreed a @entity0 - @entity3 fight in september			1
@entity34 says : ‘ i have no doubt that this fight will happen now			0
we are looking at a football stadium in september			0
’ tempers flared as the two heavyweights and their entourages clashed at the weigh - in @entity3 is set to fight @entity44 in @entity46 's @entity45 at the end of april whether that open - air spectacular takes place here or in @entity15 remains a matter of on - going negotiations			1
@entity34 always tries to secure home advantage for his boxers but @entity3 has regularly been drawing 60,000 - plus crowds to football stadiums in his adopted @entity15 throughout his 10 - year reign as the titular heavyweight champion			1
as their man is champion , @entity59 will carry greater weight in such decisions			0
all depends , of course , on @entity0 not being caught out by his occasional vulnerability to meaty blows to his chin and @entity10 vows : ‘ i ’m coming to spoil the party by knocking him out			1
’ @entity0 should handle @entity10 comfortably , however , and he knows it			1
he says : ‘ if i ca n’t beat this guy i have no place even thinking about fighting @entity3			2
if i were to lose this one there would be no point me carrying on			0
i would give up boxing			0
’ fury during the weigh - in ahead of his heavyweight fight with @entity10 , will hope to face @entity3 next yet he needs to keep active in the ring , especially given a long spell of inactivity following the cancellation of two big dates with @entity84			1
‘ boxing is a risk business , ’ he says			0
‘ i need the fights			0
’ these best - laid plans would also collapse if @entity3 were to lose to unbeaten @entity26 @entity44 in a voluntary defence of his titles at @entity46 ’s iconic @entity45 on april 25			2
that , too , is highly unlikely but with the heavyweights one punch can change the world order			0
but unless that happens @entity0 will not face @entity26 knock - out sensation @entity95 , who has just won the @entity97 world title which is the only belt not in @entity98 the @entity100 ’s possession , before challenging @entity3			1
@entity34 says : ‘ @entity3 will be first for @entity0 , although @entity95 is another big fight waiting to happen after that			1
’ @entity103 and @entity104 show off their physiques during the weigh - in at the 02 @entity108 would appear to face a somewhat sterner test at the 02 than @entity0			2
the son of @entity103 challenges @entity104 for the @entity112 interim middleweight title			0
but although most of @entity113 seems to fancy the @entity115 ’s chances , his lack of speed and mobility ought to be ideal for @entity103 and i expect him to join @entity0 in the winner ’s enclosure , both by mid-fight stoppage			2
@entity123 should make it a clean saturday night sweep for @entity127 boxing in the home - town @entity129 defence of his world super-bantamweight title against @entity132			2
the @entity133 is a born fighter but his slugging aggression leaves him an open target and @entity123 , a natural counter-puncher , will likely break him down inside eight or nine rounds			0
as @entity123 brings boxing the welcome boost of a return to mainstream terrestrial broadcasting with @entity142 , that channel and @entity144 are trying to finesse times so that viewers can watch @entity103 and then fury immediately before switching to @entity123			0
@entity147 also weighed in ahead of his fight with @entity149 on saturday @entity150 and @entity151 will be live on @entity144 from 7 pm			0
@entity152 will be live on @entity142 from 10 pm , preceded by the undercard on @entity142 .			0

@entity0 takes on @entity10 at the @entity155 in @entity12 on saturday
fury is the *mandatory* challenger to world champion @entity3
he believes a future fight against the @entity160 would be an easy one
@entity0 's dad has been in his camp following his release from prison
