if the company makes good on its threat to close the @entity2 , it would further rock an already shell - shocked casino market in what just a few years ago was the nation 's second - largest gambling market after @entity67			1
now , @entity68 has fallen behind @entity69			0
three other @entity4 casinos closed this year , as the industry struggles with competition in nearby states			1

@entity113 said that even if the union agreed to those concessions , they would only total $ 11 million per year , which would hardly make a difference in the company 's finances			1
' if our members were to work for minimum wage with no benefits , it would n't be enough to keep this property in the hands of its current owners for a year , ' he said			0
