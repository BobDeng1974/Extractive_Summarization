@entity0 has been accused by @entity1 of using its universal service commitment as an excuse to raise stamp prices			1
first and second - class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on march 30 , sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues			1
an influential committee of mps said that if @entity0 wanted to increase profits , it must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency , rather than simply increase prices			1
first and second - class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on march 30 , sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues			1
@entity18 , chairman of the @entity19 , said he was ‘ not very pleased ’ to hear they had taken the ‘ easy option ’ of raising stamp prices			1
citizens @entity23 also urged @entity0 to ‘ focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying upon raising prices ’ and expressed concern that consumers were held to ransom because they ‘ have no choice but to pay the increased prices ’			1
the cost of posting a large letter weighing up to 100g first class will rise by 2p to 95p			1
@entity0 has warned it faces aggressive competition in the parcels market from delivery firm @entity37 and called for regulators to rein in its rivals			2
the company says it is at a disadvantage to competitors because it must fulfil a 175 - year - old ‘ universal service ’ obligation to deliver to all @entity45 addresses for the same price			0
it said this obligation , which requires it to deliver six days a week to even the most rural communities , could soon become ‘ financially unsustainable ’ if @entity51 does not impose restrictions on its rivals			0
but the @entity53 will say today that there is no ‘ immediate risk ’ to the service and that , far from being a ‘ burden ’ , the service brings ‘ revenue and status ’ to @entity0			2
a new report says : ‘ @entity0 should not increase postal and packaging prices simply in an attempt either to increase its own profit levels or to protect the @entity65 , without increasing the efficiency of its operations			2
‘ while we accept that @entity0 has done much to improve efficiency , it still has to match the technical innovations introduced by many competitors — innovations that more clearly match the expectations of consumers			2
’ @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19 , said he was ‘ not very pleased ’ to hear they had taken the ‘ easy option ’ of raising stamp prices @entity79 , of the @entity80 , said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies			1
he said : ‘ while prices have only gone up by a penny , this still represents an above inflation rise			2
‘ businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers			2
’ they said they expected royal mail to use the additional money raised ‘ to invest in improving their performance and meet delivery targets ’			0
mr @entity79 added : ‘ @entity51 should carefully monitor how @entity0 is doing , and use their powers to fine should customers ’ expectations fail to be met			1
’ since 1840 , everyone in @entity45 , from the @entity103 coast to the @entity104 , has paid the same price to post a letter			0
@entity0 says this expensive obligation is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil because firms such as @entity37 ‘ cherry pick ’ deliveries in more lucrative city locations and can therefore under - cut them on price			1
but when asked for evidence that it cost more to deliver in certain geographical areas , the company was apparently unable to provide this			0
@entity18 felt the @entity0 should be trying to make efficiencies instead of raising prices the report said : ‘ we were concerned to note that @entity0 were unable to provide a regional breakdown of the cost of the @entity65			1
‘ we also surprised to learn that there is no consensus between @entity0 and @entity51 over what constitutes to cost , revenues and profits of the universal service			2
’ the report did concede that there could be a future risk to the universal service , however , ‘ given the rapidly changing postal sector market ’			0
it said @entity51 , the postal regulator , may need additional regulatory powers to ensure the future of the service			0
mr @entity18 said : ‘ the universal postal service is available to everyone living in every part of the @entity45			0
it is an essential service to many people , especially those living in rural areas , to those less able to travel , to older people , and also to blind and partially - sighted people			0
‘ while our evidence indicated the universal service is not under immediate threat , we believe @entity51 needs to outline in more detail how it would respond quickly to changes in postal market conditions which may endanger the universal service			0
’ the @entity19 also called on @entity51 to help combat any ‘ race to the bottom ’ with regards to postal workers ’ wages			0
it recommended @entity51 investigates the impact of providing the universal service on workers ’ wages and conditions			0
an @entity51 spokesman said it had the powers to ' step in quickly to protect the needs of @entity45 postal users ' if a situation ever arose			0
meanwhile , a @entity0 spokesman said they welcomed the report , and shared in some of the committee 's concerns and contribution - including the fact ' @entity51 may not be able to respond fast enough to avoid a failure in the @entity65 , even in the short term '			1
the spokesman added : ' we recognise and accept the @entity19 ’s finding that @entity0 has done much to improve efficiency , but there is still more for us to do to match the most efficient postal operators			1
we are continuing to invest in our business transformation programme and are becoming even more efficient			0
’ last year , business secretary @entity188 said @entity0 should stop ‘ whinging ’ about its obligation to deliver to all parts of the country and accused it of ‘ scaremongering ’ by claiming its future was in jeopardy .			1
