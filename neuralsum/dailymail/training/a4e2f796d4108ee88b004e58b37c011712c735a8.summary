by @entity0 last updated at 8:03 pm on 25th october 2011 if you went down under to this @entity3 zoo today , you would have been in for a triple surprise			2
because three extremely rare @entity6 tiger cubs were wowing both young and old visitors on their debut appearance at @entity9 , in @entity10			1
two of the cute triplets were curious at all the human eyes tracked on them as they happily played beside their mother			0
but one big scaredy cat was so timid it had to hide behind some foliage , away from the many camera flashes and excited children looking in to the enclosure			0
scroll down for a video of the triplets at @entity9 scaredy cat : one of the two - month - old cubs hides in the foliage , away from the flashes of cameras at @entity9 with wide eyes the two - month - old cub wonders who on earth all the people taking photos are mummy 's favourite : two of the more curious cubs perch by their mother , under the gaze of the many viewers the mother , @entity38 , took the attention in her stride , and perhaps her two - month - old cubs have been keeping her busy as at one point she produced a yawn which showed her huge mouth			0
she gave birth to the two male and one female cubs on august 20 , after mating with father @entity48			1
and the cubs will only be on show for short periods of time , as they tire very quickly for the moment , but as they age , they will spend more time on view in their enclosure			0
sumatran tigers can only be found on the @entity59 island of @entity60 - the only remaining stronghold for tigers in the country			2
experts estimate that there are just 400 such tigers left in the wild - and only 7 per cent of their original habitat remains , which is why these triplets are so important			1
sumatran tiger @entity38 enjoys a big yawn and shows all her teeth - her little ones are obviously tiring her out @entity38 is seen playing with one of her cubs on display at @entity9 here 's licking at you , kid : mother @entity38 is seen pruning one of the tiny cubs @entity79 , carnivore supervisor at @entity9 , said she was purring with delight that all three tigers are healthy and strong , after @entity48 had been flowing in from @entity82 to breed with @entity38			2
' @entity48 was brought to @entity9 from @entity83 as part of the international zoo breeding program for @entity6 tigers to mate with our @entity9 - born female @entity38 and introduce new genetics to our region , ' she told @entity90			1
' the female cub is really cheeky , with a lot of attitude and is the first one to check out new things			0
' the boys are more cautious , but they â€™re growing in confidence and body size each day , now tipping the scales over 6kg each			0
' ms @entity79 continued : ' there are only about 400 @entity6 tigers left in the wild , so to see them here at @entity9 and know that they are part of a safety - net in case wild populations go extinct is pretty remarkable			1

trio born in august after father flown in especially from @entity83
there are only 400 @entity6 tigers left in the world
