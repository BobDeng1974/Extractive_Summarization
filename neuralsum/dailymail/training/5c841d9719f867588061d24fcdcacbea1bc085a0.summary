by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 secretary @entity2 today turned in her resignation to president @entity5 in a stunning shift in the continuing @entity8 saga			1
@entity9 , who heads the @entity10 , will be nominated to take her place , according to multiple @entity10 sources			1
the @entity10 press office announced thursday night that he would announce the nomination at 11:00 a.m. friday , a few hours before he departs for fundraisers , and a speech to @entity19 's @entity18 , in @entity20			1
@entity2 was not expected to remain in the @entity5 administration through the end of the president 's second term , and several news outlets reported late thursday that a @entity10 official said she told @entity5 in march that she would be ready to leave ' once open enrollment ended			1
' she said in an interview with the @entity30 on march 31 , however – the last day of that six - month period – that she would stay at the top of the @entity3 organizational chart until @entity8 's second open enrollment period arrived in november			1
' i 'm in , ' @entity2 said then			2
but now she 's out			0
the @entity10 aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president 's flagship policy			1
republicans were quick to pounce thursday , confounding those hopes			0
' @entity2 had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as @entity8 , ' @entity69 chair rep. @entity68 said in a statement			1
' her tenure as the head of the @entity3 may be at an end , but @entity1 will be dealing with the repercussions of the president 's health law for a very long time			0
' on the @entity79 side of the @entity80 , minority leader @entity77 called it ' fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of @entity8 predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning			1
' ' regardless of the administration ’s public explanation for the secretary ’s exit , @entity8 has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of @entity1 who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families			2
' the train - wreck reference was a nod to former montana democratic sen. @entity99 , now @entity5 's ambassador to @entity100 , who warned @entity2 on april 17 , 2013 that the @entity8 was headed for the rocks			1
' i just see a huge train wreck coming down , " he said then			0
' you and i have discussed this many times , and i do n't see any results yet			0
' other @entity79 @entity64 echoed @entity109 's stern tone			0
' this is the right decision , ' according to @entity112 @entity111 sen. @entity111			0
' the challenge for ms. @entity9 , or any other successor , is to help @entity49 find the right way to repair the damage @entity8 has done to @entity1 families			1
' @entity119 sen. @entity118 said in a statement that ' [ a ] nybody put in charge of @entity8 would be set up to fail			1
secretary @entity2 was asked to promote something unready , poorly structured , and unpopular			2
' the @entity8 has indeed been fraught with disaster since its official rollout in october			2
its website crashed , cost estimates quickly rose , and public dissatisfaction has dogged the initiative for more than two years			0
the october 1 online launch was nothing short of disastrous , with even liberal commentators and @entity134 in @entity49 conceding that the government 's effort was not ready for prime time			0
contractors ' efforts were incompatible , data servers were inadequate , and payment systems linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day			0
@entity2 presided over all of it , producing misgivings across the @entity80 capital that she was up to the task			2
she has , however , been the administration 's designated spear - catcher , attracting slings and arrows from both houses of @entity49 and the public at every turn			0
kiss off : @entity2 had served in @entity5 's @entity155 for five years and was favored by the president			1
but after months of defending her she 's on her way out the president raised eyebrows nationwide on april 1 when he failed to acknowledge her contribution to the program 's recent momentum during a high - profile @entity164 victory speech			0
@entity2 , who has served in @entity5 's cabinet for five years , was not there alongside him but sat , unnoticed , in the front row			1
as the @entity10 shifted from shame to fist - pumping , @entity2 continued to attract scorn			1
@entity2 joined the @entity5 administration in april 2009 as a figure unknown to @entity1 in 49 states			1
she had been governor of @entity174 from 2003 to 2009 , and that state ; s insurance commissioner for eight years before that			0
her only national platform prior to @entity5 's election came in 2008 when , as a former chair of the @entity181 , she was tapped to deliver her party 's response to president @entity184 's final @entity186 address			1
she was n't expected to play a role in the new administration until former sen. @entity189 , a @entity190 politician who had once been @entity191 , withdrew his candidacy for the top @entity3 job following a tax scandal			2
he had failed to pay taxes on more than $ 83,000 in earnings in 2007 , and claimed tax deductions for nearly $ 15,000 of donations to charities that did n't meet the @entity201 's tax - deductibility standards			2
@entity2 has n't said where she will go after she leaves the president 's cabinet			1
her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner ( @entity209 ) , a university professor ( @entity211 ) and a think - tank chief ( @entity212 )			0
none of them , however , presided over a program that , like @entity8 , was controversial , partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning			2
she said during a @entity219 hearing on thursday that more than 7.5 million @entity1 had chosen health insurance plans through the @entity8 system			1
she could not , however , answer a question from @entity224 sen. @entity223 about how many subscribers were uninsured before the law took effect			0
additionally , she has n't provided @entity49 with answers about how many @entity8 enrollees have paid premiums , a necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans			1
a recent @entity234 study estimated that no more than 1 million @entity1 both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system			0
the @entity10 has not announced the date of @entity242 ' departure , but a senior aid to a @entity64 senator told @entity245 that a quicker resolution to the @entity3 vacancy would benefit both sides of the aisle more than a long , drawn - out process			1
her resignation will also leave @entity79 @entity64 with an unusually irresistible opening to drag more details of the @entity8 's implementation into public view			2
although @entity134 will likely have more than enough votes to confirm @entity5 's nominee , more than a half - dozen liberals facing difficulties re-election fights will likely be forced to moderate their enthusiasm for @entity242 's replacement			2
public hearings could become a spectacle of republicans demanding internal documents and the @entity10 claiming executive privilege			2
at the least , the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives ' objections to @entity5 's new insurance model			2
' the president does n't need more @entity8 controversy so close to november , ' a senior aide to a @entity79 @entity64 told @entity245 shortly after the announcement of @entity2 ' departure			1
' and if @entity64 object too much to @entity9 , the @entity134 will trot out the " war on women " narrative even more			2
we do n't need that in an election year			1
' @entity10 sources were at pains to point out on thursday that @entity2 was n't forced to leave , but she told @entity30 on march 31 that she planned to stay through november the administration was insistent that that @entity2 was not forced out			1
@entity10 chief of staff @entity287 told the @entity289 that @entity2 had approached @entity5 months ago with the idea that a less maligned figure could better serve in her position as the public face of @entity8			1
' she 's made it clear in other comments publicly that she recognizes that she takes a lot of the incoming [ criticism ] , ' he told the @entity289			0
@entity2 said she hoped her resignation would be the start of an era of cooperation in @entity303 to help make healthcare better			0
but , she said , she did not expect it to be the case			0
' if i could take something along with me , ' she told the @entity289 on thursday			0
' [ it would be ] all the animosity			0
if that could just leave with me , and we could get to a new chapter , that would be terrific			0
' @entity2 accepted a herculean task when @entity5 tapped her to quarterback the implementation of the @entity8			1
@entity189 , a former @entity181 @entity191 , withdrew his nomination in 2009 after scandal erupted over his past income taxes			0
she was seen as a consensus second - choice within the @entity134 , a relative unknown despite her terms as governor of @entity174 and a stint as the state 's insurance commissioner			0
but her legacy , like the president 's , is intertwined with @entity8 – a policy initiative that is increasingly unpopular			1
an april 3 - 6 poll released thursday by the @entity330 and @entity331 found that more than half of @entity1 disapprove of the new system			0
and more than 80 per cent say their views on @entity8 will strongly influence their @entity337 decisions seven months from now			0
@entity10 minority leader @entity338 , a @entity339 @entity181 former @entity10 speaker , insisted that @entity2 has discharged her duties with honor			1
' from day one , secretary @entity2 has remained laser - focused on a single purpose : to make health care a right , not a privilege , for all @entity1 , ' @entity338 said			0
' her leadership has been forceful , effective , and essential			0

@entity8 quarterback leaves after *informing* @entity5 in march that she was ready to resign
@entity2 claimed less than two weeks ago , however , that she would remain in her job at least through the november elections
move comes a week after president announced @entity8 had hit target of 7 million enrollees – without her by his side
@entity10 insists she was n't forced out , but republicans are set to exploit the nomination of her successor in an election year
@entity9 , who leads @entity10 , will be nominated to take her place friday *morning*
