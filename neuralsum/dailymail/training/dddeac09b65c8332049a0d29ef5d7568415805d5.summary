by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 21 november 2013 she has won three @entity3 style awards and was even dubbed ' beautiful ' and a ' phenomenon ' by @entity5 and @entity6			1
so what 's @entity9 's secret ? ' since turning 30 , i have n't really changed my attitude towards health			1
i 'm still smoking like a chimney			2
' its not going to happen overnight because i 've only been 30 for like , a week			1
but approaching 30 , i started thinking about being healthier			1
i 've started doing ballet and being conscious of what i put in my body			1
oh , and i eat fish oils now as well , ' the model told @entity20			1
beauty secrets : it girl @entity9 shared her new outlook on her health with @entity24 ( and it consists of cigarettes and fish oils ) the tv presenter and fashionista was speaking at the launch of her cosmetics line with indie brand @entity31 , which lands in @entity32 today			1
in her new role as creative consultant at @entity31 , @entity33 has used her beauty know - how , as well as her illustrative and photographic talents , to custom - design the first in a line of limited edition sets			1
to launch the range the star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature cat flick eyes			2
sharing her top tips for achieving the iconic @entity33 flick , she said : ' i started doing this cat eye flick when i was about 17 and i do it every single day , so i 've had years of practice			2
beauty queen : the tv presenter and all - round fashionista was speaking at the launch of her cosmetics line with indie brand @entity31 , which lands in @entity32 today cool as a cucumber : @entity33 , who donned an all - black ensemble an on - trend @entity60 pumps , says her beauty icon is @entity63 ' i do the outside flick first , just one line , then see if they 're even and level then i 'll just draw the rest in to match it but sometimes i do it too thick and have to start again ; i am obsessed with perfecting it			1
my record time is about a minute and half on a good day , ' she said			2
@entity33 hopes her new products , which have quirky names such as ' eye do ' liquid eyeliner , will help her fans emulate her look			2
speaking about her eyeliner , she said : ' the nib is the perfect shape and size to give you control			0
it gives you the precision to draw on the perfect cat eye			0
' it ’s pitch black and waterproof so it does n’t move even on the waterline			0
i love that it enhances my lashes each time i use it			0
' speaking about her mascara , which is packed with @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and botanical proteins that claim to promote lash growth , she said : ' i love a @entity105 doe - eyed look and this gives me longer , thicker , blacker lashes without the hassle of falsies			2
' it stays on forever but feels amazing thanks to all the lash enhancing magic in the mix. ' quirky : @entity33 has created the eye make - up and the packaging herself and it comes complete with kooky sketches she cites her all - time beauty icon as @entity63 but says she 's ' too selfish ' to think of a modern day version ( although she would love to raid @entity125 's beauty bag )			1
despite being one of fashion 's most famous muses , who has taken home the @entity131 at the @entity132 for three consecutive years , @entity33 is n't up for a gong this time around - but she is n't too bothered			1
' i have won it for the past three years , which is great but it 's nice that other people are up for it this time around			0
' at least i do n’t have to do a speech , which i 've been very awkward about giving the last three years			0
' also i think it 's quite a good indication of fashion and how it moves , how you 're in and you ’re out			0
maybe in ten years time people will start wearing me again ! '			0
want to look like @entity33 ? now you can ! the model and muse has unveiled a new eye make - up range with @entity31 2013 will see @entity147 and @entity148 take on @entity149 and @entity150 for the title - and it 's the men who 've got @entity33 's vote			1
' i would love to see @entity156 win			2
@entity148 's on the list , i 'd love to see him win			1
let 's give it to him. , he 's got a lovely suit			0
' @entity33 , who turned 30 earlier this week , celebrated with celebrity friends @entity147 , @entity163 and @entity164 in the trendy @entity165			1
' my birthday was epic			0
the thing about that cake was we did n’t cut it , which was weird			0
@entity171 : @entity33 celebrated her 30th with @entity163 , @entity147 and @entity164 at the swanky @entity173 hotel ' people in the morning just scooped fistfuls of it into their mouths			1
when i walked past the cake in the morning it was literally as if a gang of children had come and attacked			0
so that was nice , ' she said			0
@entity33 , who counts herself as a contributing editor to @entity185 and style ambassador for the @entity187 , seems set on building an empire			0
she recently turned author and penned a book - titled it - which invites fashion fans into her stylish world			2
and now with a book under her belt , @entity33 says she is keen to develop her career further , with forays into music and acting			0
brains behind the brand : established in 1999 , @entity31 was devised by make - up veterans and partners @entity204 and @entity205 ( pictured here with newest recruit , @entity33 ) @entity33 the author : @entity9 's debut book , it , featuring her witty musings on life and style was unveiled in september @entity213 : as a front row regular , @entity33 possesses all the best insider knowledge @entity9 for @entity31 will cost £ 35 per set and be exclusively pre-launched at @entity32 , @entity216 on november 14 where she will be meeting and greeting fans			1
desperate to emulate @entity33 's signature cat flick eyeliner and smokey eyed look , @entity24 writer @entity0 put her new range to the test ... ' a lot of girls want to look like @entity33 , she has that " just rolled out of bed " indie girl style so when she unveiled her debut make - up range , we were keen to give it a spin			1
the mascara is good , very thick and lasts all day and it 's good to know that it 's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it			0
it 's pretty tough to get off though , we recommend using a gentle eye make - up remover like @entity239 's @entity238 remover as it can be quite stubborn			1
as for the eyeliner , if you have the knack for applying it , it looks great			0
however , it is very , very black so may be too heavy on some fair - haired ladies			2
the packaging is what wins us over and would be great as a @entity250 stocking filler			0
