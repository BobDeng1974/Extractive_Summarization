' it is a disgrace when a person who 's working for @entity1 does n't get paid for his labour , ' @entity2 said in comments reported by @entity0 , which said he agreed to pay after talks with sports minister @entity14			2
@entity1 boss @entity5 has not been paid by the @entity7 since june it was not immediately clear how the @entity7 , which has repeatedly said it lacks the funds to pay @entity5 , would be able to pay back the loan to @entity2 , or how it would afford future wage payments to @entity5 , who was contracted through 2018			1
