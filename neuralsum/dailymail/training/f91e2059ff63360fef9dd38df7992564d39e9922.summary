@entity1 's youngest competitive bodybuilder has revealed that the secret to his muscular body is down to sibling rivalry			1
@entity5 , 15 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , has competed in a major national competition and is more likely to be honing his abs in his local gym than gaming on his playstation			1
but @entity5 's unusual passion for the sport is something that runs in the family with his sister and father providing healthy competition for the young athlete			1
and while the brother and sister duo continually push each other to improve their personal bests , @entity5 admits that there is some bubbling sibling rivalry between the pair			1
' i 'm very competitive with @entity24			1
' says the 15 - year - old			0
' if she 's going to do 12 reps on something , i 'll do 15			0
it 's a sibling thing			0
' at just 14 @entity41 took part in his first national competition in @entity45 in november 2014 as well as his sister providing plenty of stiff competition , @entity5 's father @entity29 , left , is also a body builder @entity29 says that when the siblings visit the gym together they will often challenge one another their father says that although @entity24 is lighter than @entity5 she is probably stronger and provides a fair amount of competition for her younger brother @entity5 also admits that although his family offers him plenty of support their competitive streak can also become a nuisance			1
' my dad and sister were a big inspiration , but sometimes my sister can be a big irritation			0
' and the rivalry has not escaped the attention of dad @entity29 who says that he often sees the siblings go head to head while working out			1
the siblings with their mum @entity80 ( centre ) with the pair 's daily diet which includes plenty of protein ' sometimes in the gym there can be a competitive edge to them , depending on who 's working what particular exercise that night , and if they both happen to be working the same exercise , they will feed off each other			1
' he added that although @entity41 is heavier than his sister that does not stop her from providing some stiff competition for her younger brother			0
' @entity24 being that bit older , although she 's a girl and lighter than @entity5 , she will often just reel @entity5 in , ' he said			1
as a competitive family , their living room is littered with trophies from the family 's achievements ' she 'll let him go so far , but then she pulls it right back because she 's got a lot more experience than @entity5			1
' @entity110 she 's probably just as strong and in a lot of events she 's still actually stronger than @entity5 , something that @entity5 finds difficult to accept at times			2
but that 's just the way it is because @entity24 does tend to catch everyone out with the way she looks			2
' breakfast : scrambled eggs and porridge oats mid-morning : roast chicken and salad lunch : chicken , pork , steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice dinner : chicken , pork , steak or fish with salad and sweet potato @entity29 added that you should n't be fooled by @entity24 's feminine looks			1
' she 's very slim , slender , tall , elegant , but you put weights on the ground and she will outlift most people , even @entity5 , and that 's something he 's got to live with for a little while			2
' @entity24 , who competes at national and international powerlifting events , works for the family 's removals business - and @entity41 is more than happy to lend a hand when he can			2
she says : ' doing removals keeps me mobile but i would n't class it as training , it 's a different type of strength but it allows me plenty of free hours to pursue my interests that i would n't have with a nine to five job			0
' @entity5 , who started training informally at the age of 11 , competed in his first show , the @entity164 in @entity45 , in november 2014 , and has plans to enter more competitions in the future			0
@entity5 says that he is enjoying all the attention his muscles receive at school the siblings combines muscles come in handy for lending a hand in the family 's removal business but for now @entity5 says that he is enjoying the attention that his super-sized muscles bring him at school			2
' some people want to see my abs , see my arms , they think it 's really cool			0
some people even want me to be their personal trainer ! ' i think it 's quite funny , but they 're always supportive , asking me if i 've got any events coming up , there 's a really good atmosphere			0
' and while some people have expressed concerns about @entity5 competing at such a young age , he is adamant that he is not putting himself at risk			2
' i 've been training for almost four years now and i 've been injury free			0
if you 're going to do something stupid , that 's how you 're going to injure yourself			0
it 's the same with any sport			0
