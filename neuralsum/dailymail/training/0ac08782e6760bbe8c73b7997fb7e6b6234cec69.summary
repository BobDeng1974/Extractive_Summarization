@entity4 , a @entity7 - born , @entity6 - raised model , is one of seven in the new ad campaign , starring alongside the likes of industry heavyweight @entity10 and @entity13 model @entity11 @entity0 rarely hires @entity15 and black models so the 19 - year - old 's inclusion in the campaign is something of a milestone			1
