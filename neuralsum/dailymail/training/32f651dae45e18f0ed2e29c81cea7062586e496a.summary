mrs @entity2 , who is married to @entity33 , said : ' i have had headaches for 10 to 12 years but i was never referred to the hospital for an x-ray or anything			1
' the medication kept going up and up and they said it was all sorts of things , such as depression			0

@entity2 had a ct scan at the @entity11 last july
the mother - of - four had been suffering headaches for more than a decade
days after her scan the 42 - year - old was given the all - clear
but in august she collapsed at work , suffering a brain haemorrhage after an aneurysm - a swelling of blood in an artery or vein - burst
the hospital has apologised telling mrs @entity2 part of her scan results were missing from her patient folder , as a result of a ' computer failure '
@entity11 said it is ' likely ' with the missing results they would *'ve* seen the aneurysm and given a correct diagnosis
@entity11 said changes have been made to prevent a similar incident in *future*
