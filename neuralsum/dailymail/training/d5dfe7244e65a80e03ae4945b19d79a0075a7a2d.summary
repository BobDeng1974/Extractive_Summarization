by @entity0 those who frequently use the word ' like ' in conversation may be more thoughtful , research shows it is , like , a really annoying habit			1
but do n’t be too swift to dismiss those who pepper their conversation with ‘ like ’			2
because far from being a sign of low intelligence , it may signal thoughtfulness			2
those who frequently use the ‘ discourse marker ’ may be simply taking time to think about what they are saying , if you know what i mean			1
the theory comes from @entity21 researchers who analysed recordings made of more than 200 men and women as they took part in conversations in their everyday lives			1
the team , from the @entity29 , looked at how often the volunteers used the word ‘ like ’			1
they also counted up mentions of ‘ i mean ’ and ‘ you know ’			0
so called filled pauses – ‘ ums ’ and ‘ uhs ’ were also totted up and the results compared with information about the volunteers ’ personalities			0
despite frequent use of ‘ like ’ often being seen as a sign of empty - headedness , the word was a particular favourite of conscientious types			0
the researchers admitted this could be a rogue result			0
but , assuming it is reliable , it may be that ‘ like ’ , as well as ‘ i mean ’ and ‘ you know ’ are signs of more considered speech			1
in other words , footballers who fall back on it in @entity60 interviews , and starlets who say it over and over may be more thoughtful than you give them credit for			0
the study , published in the @entity66 , also found that the three discourse markers were more popular with women than men and with the young than the old			1
the researchers said : ‘ as people become older , the gender effect disappears			2
this may be indicative of normative life transition into adult roles , such as when one graduates from college and enters a job market			0
‘ a career role change may be a possible factor that leads people to change their use of filler words			2
’ similarly ‘ ums ’ and ‘ uhs ’ were more common in the young			0
however , their use was not linked to gender or to personality , despite their often been seen as a sign of anxiety			0
the scientists from the @entity29 anaylsed 200 people 's conversation - and found those who used ' like ' and other filler words had more considered speech ( library image )			1

scientists at @entity29 analysed conversations of 200 people
found those who frequently use ' like ' have more considered speech
