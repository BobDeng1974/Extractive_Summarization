@entity0 believes @entity2 chief executive @entity1 was ' spot on ' to describe @entity6 's @entity5 performance as unacceptable - but the @entity7 and @entity8 full back still thinks @entity10 's side are genuine @entity11 contenders			1
@entity6 were only narrowly pipped to the @entity12 on points difference by @entity14 after a dramatic final day and have had praise lavished on them from all quarters for their attacking brand of rugby , which saw them score 18 tries in five matches			1
but for @entity0 , like @entity1 , second place is simply not good enough			1
@entity0 is adamant that second place is not good enough despite @entity6 's impressive performances the @entity8 full back was in fine form for @entity6 throughout the @entity5 ' we 're not in there to be second so he 's spot on really , ' he said			1
' we did n't have an aim of coming second , we had an aim of winning silverware and coming first , so he has n't said anything we do n't agree with or think ourselves			0
' we do n't accept coming second because we want to win , and that 's it			2
' @entity0 has been forced to sit out @entity8 ' trip to @entity39 to face @entity40 in the @entity41 on saturday with concussion			1
if you include the @entity46 match , when he was taken off after being knocked out in the opening minutes , it will be the third match out of five he has missed through concussion for country and club			0
with no game next week though , @entity0 is hoping an extended break and a holiday in the sun will have him fit and raring to go for the season finale			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's disappointing but first and foremost it 's about my health and with a big year coming up that 's the most important thing for me and @entity6			1
' i got a couple of knocks right near the end of the @entity65 game and on sunday and monday had a little bit of a headache so we 're being cautious and doing the right things			0
' i was off next week anyway , the @entity6 guys have a week off and there is n't a game so that was always the plan			1
' so we 'll see how i am after that , hopefully a bit of sun and a tan will cure it			0
' @entity0 lies motionless after being knocked out against @entity46			1
he was taken off and missed the @entity14 game with just six months to go until the @entity11 it is a nervous time for any @entity6 hopeful but , typical of the man , @entity0 is adamant the only way to approach the next two months of club rugby is to go hell for leather			1
' it can be difficult because it 's always in your mind , such a big goal , ' @entity0 said of balancing club and country ambitions			1
' i 've never played in a @entity11 so for me it 's everything , it 's what i 've worked towards			2
' and the fact it 's in our home country adds a bit extra and we have got a realistic chance of winning the thing because of the way we are playing and the way we have progressed			2
' it 's hard not to think about but once you 're back at your club the games come so thick and fast you leave it in the back of your mind and focus on just giving it your all			2
' with five matches to go , @entity8 are down in eighth place in the table , nine points off an automatic @entity118 spot and four off a play - off place			1
for a side that won the title just three years ago and have finished in the top four in the last two seasons , it has been a campaign of disappointment so far			0
but with @entity0 , @entity6 captain @entity126 , club captain @entity127 and veteran no 8 @entity129 all back in their ranks from international duty for the final push , they have more than a fighting chance of salvaging it			1
@entity0 trudges off the @entity137 pitch after @entity6 were pipped to the @entity12 by @entity14 attention switches to club rugby now for @entity0 as @entity8 look to finish in the top six @entity0 says : ' we want to be playing at the top level of @entity143 rugby , we want to have those great nights at the @entity145 , so we 're desperate to try and get that top six spot and we know we can do it			1
' whatever the outcome , next season holds exciting prospects for @entity8 with legendary @entity151 prop @entity152 and former @entity154 captain @entity153 joining their ranks			2
brown enthused : ' those two guys have played at the highest level , so that sort of experience will be great for us and great for our young guys			0
' @entity152 will be great for our two young tight heads ( @entity165 ) @entity164 and ( @entity167 ) @entity166 who are going to turn out to be two world class players			0
' i 've heard he 's a good character off the field as well so to have another guy like that to go with @entity174 ( @entity175 ) and @entity176 ) will be great for the squad and give it a good blend			0
' @entity0 works closely with @entity180 and backs them as part of the @entity184 fund , which launched this week			2
he has donated all of his autumn international man of the series prize money to them in 2013 and also sells his kit viainmylocker.com to raise money for the team			0
it is something that is close to his heart , as he explains			0
' i got introduced to wheelchair rugby through my future father - in - law , he saw it on the internet and thought it might be something i 'd be interested in , knowing the sort of fast - paced sports i like			0
' there is a little link with my @entity203 as well because he 's got mild @entity204 and sometimes has to use a wheelchair			0
it 's great to help in any way i can			0
' @entity0 poses in january with @entity180 duo @entity208 ( left ) and @entity209 ( right ) @entity0 was speaking about his support of @entity180 at the @entity212 launch , a nationwide initiative from @entity41 , title sponsor of @entity215 , which offers support and funding to causes close to your heart			2
