@entity0 knew who to call when he first clapped eyes on a young , raw but gifted @entity3 at @entity5 eight years ago			1
‘ i ’d never compare him to people who have gone before , including someone i was close to , but i remember speaking to that certain all - rounder when @entity3 was about 15 and the cheeky little sod had come into our dressing room , ’ said one of @entity8 ’s best modern fast bowlers			1
‘ i rang him and said , “ i ’ve just seen you ”			0
’ the call was made , of course , to @entity18 , inseparable from @entity0 during their @entity8 days , and the comparison has proved to be a valid one , with @entity3 conjuring up echoes of the @entity23 both on and off the pitch			1
@entity0 believes that @entity3 ( pictured ) can be as good as @entity18 for @entity8 @entity3 possesses a rare ability with bat and ball , but also a propensity to self - destruct - much like @entity18 ‘ @entity29 asked me what i meant , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ and i said , “ well , he goes out to bowl with no socks on and just picks up a bat and goes out to bat ”			1
everything is an event with @entity3 and he has gone on to be a phenomenal cricketer			2
’ of all the promising young players who have emerged for @entity8 in the past year , none has the potential to excite — and perhaps frustrate — as much as @entity3 , who joined the team in leaving for their one - day series in @entity44 on sunday			1
he has already shown , at 23 , that he possesses rare ability with both bat and ball but also the propensity to flirt with the self - destruct button a @entity50 , as most spectacularly shown when he thumped a locker in frustration in @entity53 in march and badly broke his right wrist			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity18 were inseparable at times during their @entity8 careers @entity3 kicks the ground in frustration during a test match against @entity59 in july ‘ @entity3 can be as good as he wants to be , ’ said @entity0 , speaking to promote @entity61 ’s sponsorship of the @entity62 ’ @entity63			1
‘ but he needs to be used in the right manner and @entity8 must n’t stop him being the explosive , charismatic character he wants to be			2
personally , i would take a bit of pressure off his bowling and put more onus on his batting			0
‘ i think the frustrations of playing on a big stage and then going to a smaller one can get to him			0
he went last winter from @entity73 , with everything going well for him on fast wickets , to the @entity76 on slow ones being watched by one man and his dog			0
that ’s when frustrations come out			0
he ’s had to learn			0
because of his own doing in punching that locker he ’s let in two players in @entity84 and @entity85 who are now competition for places			0
but @entity3 is one of the best young players i ’ve ever seen			2
it ’s hard to put that on one man ’s shoulders but if he is batting at six and bowling well , @entity8 have a very good team			2
’ @entity95 can be ' as good as he wants to be , ' according to former @entity8 fast bowler @entity0 @entity3 has also impressed for his county side @entity5 , pictured celebrating in september at @entity97 @entity0 believes @entity8 are approaching the most intensive 18 months of cricket in their history with a bowling attack that stands comparison with the fabled quintet of @entity0 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity18 and @entity105 from the 2005 ashes			1
‘ @entity107 is the key to how @entity8 do in @entity44 and the @entity109 , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i believe that , if they are all fit and firing , ( @entity114 ) @entity113 , ( @entity116 ) @entity115 , @entity107 , @entity3 and ( @entity117 ) @entity110 is as good a line - up as we had in 2005 , i really do			2
and @entity107 is the key to that			0
‘ if he can get back to his best it makes life easier for others			0
and they could be better than we were because , other than @entity114 , they have youth on their side too			0

@entity3 possesses a rare ability with both bat and ball
he also has the propensity to flirt with the self - destruct button

the former @entity8 bowler says he can be as good as @entity18
