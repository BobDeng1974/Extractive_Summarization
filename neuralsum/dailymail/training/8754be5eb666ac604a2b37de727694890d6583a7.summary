top secret papers used to break the @entity1 were discovered at @entity2 - because they were used as draught excluders			1
the papers include the only known examples of ' @entity7 sheets ' which were devised by @entity8 to speed up the process of decrypting @entity11 messages			1
they were found in @entity13 of @entity15 's main codebreaking centre , codenamed @entity2 , in @entity16 , @entity17 , in september 2013 by builders who were renovating the unit			1
they are the only examples of @entity7 sheets ever to be discovered			1
during the war , @entity13 had poor heating , no toilets and nothing in terms of insulation			2
@entity39 , from @entity40 in @entity41 , who is now in her 90s , was a member of the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			0
she worked on @entity45 police messages in the mansion at @entity2 , which revealed the beginning of the @entity48 with the massacres of thousands of @entity50 on the eastern front			2
' the huts we slept in were thrown up in a great hurry and had thin walls so in the winter one 's flannel would be frozen by the morning			0
' they were very , very basic conditions , but we were young , we did n't mind , ' she said			0
top - secret papers used to break the @entity1 were used as draught excluders by cold codebreakers at @entity2			1
they were devised by @entity8 , left , and portrayed by @entity64 , right amongst the documents found in the roof of @entity13 were notes made by @entity8 's team of codebreakers ( left ) and a banbury sheet ( right ) devised by @entity8 as part of the efforts to crack the @entity74 code the @entity75 , which also stars @entity76 , left , is based on @entity78 ' book @entity8 : the @entity74 @entity2 's codebreakers provided vital intelligence which helped win the @entity81			1
their contribution to the war effort is told in @entity85 , starring @entity64 as @entity8			2
@entity8 was praised by @entity86 as having made ' the single biggest contribution ' to the @entity89 victory			2
the @entity15 mathematician and pioneer in computer science hastened the end of the @entity94 by cracking @entity45 's wartime communications code			0
notes made by the @entity2 codebreakers during the @entity94 ( pictured above ) were found along with parts of an @entity99 , a pinboard and a fashion article from a magazine in the space between the roof beams he devised the process of ' @entity107 ' in 1940 in order to glean information about the likely daily setting of the enigma machine used by the @entity45 to encrypt messages			1
it involved aligning two @entity7 sheets and placing them over a light			1
if two holes corresponded , then the light would shine through and using this , likely settings could be deduced			0
@entity2 has now undergone an Â£ 8million renovation to restore the codebreaking centre			1
the papers found in @entity13 have been frozen to prevent decay and will go on display there next month			1
@entity126 , chief executive of the @entity127 , told @entity128 : ' discovering these pieces of code - breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how the codebreakers actually worked			0
' the fact that these papers were used to block draughty holes in the primitive hut walls reminds us of the rudimentary conditions under which these extraordinary people were working			2
' the work carried out in the mansion at @entity2 was kept secret for decades and many of the women who worked there thought they would take their experiences to the grave in the early 1940s , @entity15 was losing the @entity81 and was on the verge of being invaded by @entity45			2
geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code @entity45 used to communicate with their u-boat submarines			0
@entity8 's top - secret work with cryptologists at @entity15 's main decryption centre at @entity2 saved countless lives by breaking @entity45 's enigma machine code			1
the codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission			0
and @entity8 was praised by @entity86 as having made ' the single biggest contribution ' to the @entity89 victory			2
but the computer pioneer received no credit and as a gay man in an era when homosexuality was illegal , was convicted of gross indecency in 1952			0
he committed suicide two years later			0
he was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality 60 years after his death in 1954			0
the story of @entity8 and the codebreakers is told in @entity85 starring @entity64 and @entity76			0
it has been nominated for eight @entity176 , including @entity177 and best actor for @entity64 's performance			0
@entity39 , today , left and right during the war , said she struggled to find a job after @entity2 because she was n't able to tell anyone what she had been doing in the @entity184 a handwritten notebook by mathematician @entity8 is expected to fetch $ 1million at auction in april			1

the discovery includes the only known examples of ' @entity7 sheets '
they were devised by @entity8 to speed up decryption of @entity11 codes
found in @entity13 of the codebreaking centre in september 2013 by builders
they had been stuffed in holes in the walls and ceilings to keep out cold
