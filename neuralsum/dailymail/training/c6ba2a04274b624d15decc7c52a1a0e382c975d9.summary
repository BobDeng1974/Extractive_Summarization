by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has been given the unwanted title of @entity5 's accidental overdose capital while @entity6 comes in at a close second with the rise in the misuse of painkillers labelled as the reason for the increase			1
@entity13 was next on the dreaded list followed by @entity15 and then @entity16 while figures were not provided for @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity20			1
the @entity22 capital city rate of 5.6 overdose deaths per 100,000 rose above the national average of four deaths per 100,000 , according to the @entity27 mortality data			0
the number of these accidental overdoses had more than doubled in @entity2 in 2012 with 106 deaths compared to only 49 deaths a decade earlier			1
a rise in misuse of prescription painkillers , now dubbed as ' harmaceuticals ' , including powerful opioids - oxycodone and fentanyl - has been linked with the alarming increase in deaths			1
former junkie @entity40 , who turned to prescribed medication when he could n't get this hands on heroin , was not surprised by the data saying the access to such drugs had ' boomed ' in recent years			2
the data from a decade up until 2012 shows that @entity2 has the most accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country the increase has been linked with the rise in misuse of prescription painkillers , now dubbed as ' harmaceuticals ' , including powerful opioids - oxycodone and fentanyl former junkie @entity40 was not surprised by the alarming data saying the access to such drugs had ' boomed ' in recent years mr @entity40 said the two most common types of users were those with genuine pain who misused prescription medication and those who were n't in pain but illegally obtain legal pharmaceuticals			1
the latter was the path that mr @entity40 went down			0
' i got them on the black market - just off the street - it was really easy , ' he said			0
' it 's demand driven - people will resort to whatever mechanisms they can to get them			0
' but he said prescriptions were also easy to obtain through the legal avenues of a doctor 's clinic			0
' there seems to have been a change in the way doctors prescribe because they are much more available now , ' he said			0
meanwhile , accidental drug overdoses are happening more outside of @entity5 's capital cities for the first time as more remote areas have less access to adequate treatment and services			1
experts say a reason for the shift was a lack of choice when ' doctor shopping ' in the areas away from the @entity101 which has seen more people relying on prescribed drugs and even accessing medication through the black market			2
after living in @entity15 for 25 years , mr @entity40 moved to @entity107 to start a new life and although he has been clean for the past 16 months , he said prescribed medication was a big problem in the northern @entity112 town			1
' there is no heroin here - in the big cities like @entity15 and @entity16 you have got a pretty available heroin market - but here it 's all black market pharmaceuticals , ' he said			1
' it all comes back to the fact that heroin was available on prescription for people they would not be using oxycodone and fentanyl - it 's a pretty strong convincing argument for regulated supply			0
' mr @entity40 said prescriptions were also easy to obtain through the legal avenues of a doctor 's clinic the accidental overdose death rate is now higher away from the east coast 's city lights in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity112 , according to the latest statistics commissioned by the @entity139 in @entity16			1
' which means that it 's almost certainly due to prescription drug misuse , ' mr @entity140 said			2
the institute 's ceo @entity140 said there has not been a shift in heroin use in regional areas ' for example , oxycodone and fentanyl are powerful opioid painkillers and the number of prescriptions is rising			2
' overdose deaths involving these types of drugs are increasing as community use levels go up			0
' other reasons for the increase in accidental overdoses has been put down to waiting lists for methodone programs and inevitably longer ambulance response times in the regional and rural area			1
mr @entity40 said access to methodone was rare in the @entity107 area			0
' here the drug that is used is buprenorphine which is not as strong - it does n't have that same kind of bang and it can be difficult of people to access treatment , ' he said			0
mr @entity140 said people rely on painkiller prescriptions more outside of city because there is less access to specialist pain treatment			0
' methadone programs reduce overall overdose , but in regional and rural areas there are no where near enough prescribers and waiting lists can be years in some parts of country @entity5 , ' mr @entity140 said			2
' doctor shopping is undoubtedly an issue , and in many regional areas there are extensive black markets involving networks covering hundreds of square kilometres , ' he said			0
the number of accidental drug deaths ( per 100,000 people ) in the regional and rural areas has risen by 127 per cent in the past decade up until 2012			2
however , it 's a different story on the west coast with , @entity2 coming out on top with more accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country			1
@entity6 was the only other capital city that remained higher in mortalities than the rest of the state with more than double the amount of accidental drug - induced deaths compared to the rest of @entity5 during the 10 year - period			1
although figures were not provided for @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity20 .			0

@entity2 has more accidental overdoses than the rest of @entity5
while @entity6 has come in at a close second
followed by @entity13 , @entity15 and then @entity16
the increase is *believed* to be due to the misuse of prescribed painkillers
