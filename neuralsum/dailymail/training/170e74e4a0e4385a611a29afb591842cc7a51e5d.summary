‘ i remember saying , “ i 'd better put my mac on , ” because i wanted to cover up and @entity49 [ @entity8 ’s grandson ] saying “ no , not right now			0
” ‘ i 'd just about got outside and the rain was pouring down and i did n't have my contact lenses in , but i was making my way out and @entity6 and her two children were behind me			2
