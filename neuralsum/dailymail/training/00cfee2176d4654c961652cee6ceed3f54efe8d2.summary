@entity0 believes the confidence instilled in many clouds when winning the @entity3 at @entity4 in november has made his gelding a genuine @entity6 contender			1
the @entity10 trainer ’s assertion will be tested at the track on saturday when the @entity13 - owned eight - year - old lines up in the @entity14 against a line - up which includes last month ’s @entity17 runner - up @entity19 plus solid marker @entity20 , winner of the race 12 months ago and placed in the last three @entity23			2
victory for many clouds would carry @entity0 to the brink of a notable landmark			1
he needs only two more successes to reach 1,000 career wins			1
many @entity25 ( left ) sprints clear to win the @entity3 at @entity4 back in november but he would probably swap plenty of them to get his hands on the most prestigious prize in steeplechasing			1
@entity0 said : ‘ my instinct is he is good enough			1
he used to make the odd jumping mistake as a novice but he is confident now			2
his schooling has been electric			2
his work is more confident			2
he is cocky – he thinks he is @entity41			2
‘ the proof of the pudding is on the racecourse but my gut feeling is that he has improved again			2
‘ confidence is a huge thing in horses as well as humans			2
he knew he won the @entity3			1
i am a huge believer in building a horse up gradually			2
you can aim too high too quickly and ruin a horse ’s confidence			0
going slowly can pay dividends			0
’ that policy has paid off for @entity0 with a gelding , who only cost £ 4,500 ( 6,000 euros )			1
he ran in the 2012 @entity59 won by @entity60 , finishing ninth but on the heels of reigning champion @entity62 and his big @entity64 rival for that crown , @entity66			1
@entity0 steered many clouds away from the @entity68 the following season before a return last march ended when he and regular jockey @entity70 were brought down in the @entity71 won by @entity72			1
@entity0 believes many clouds is therefore a contender for this year 's @entity6 however , this particular cloud had a definite silver lining			1
@entity0 said : ‘ the winner had beaten him many clouds in the @entity80 but we were giving him 4lb so we had to be knocking on the door			1
‘ i was gutted but then a week later i thought it might be a blessing in disguise because had he won or been second he would not have been weighted to win a @entity3			1
’ if confidence is sky - high in the star of @entity92 ’s @entity91 , from where @entity93 trained @entity94 to win the 1938 @entity95 , it is also back coursing through the veins of a trainer relishing being back on the big saturday stage			0
when he started training in 1984 , the @entity100 supporter who had been a champion amateur in the 1978/80 season and served an apprenticeship with legendary @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , was regarded as champion trainer material			0
a seamless flow of headline winners with horses like @entity111 , @entity112 , lord of @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , a 15 - time winner who was second to @entity119 in the @entity120			0
but the @entity122 crash hit him hard , horses numbers fell and he tumbled down the fashion scale			0
his last @entity127 win came via @entity128 in 2000 before being switched by owner @entity129 to the @entity131 stable and the last of @entity0 ’s six @entity68 winners came 20 years ago when @entity133 - ridden @entity112 won the @entity134			1
he was even forced to sell @entity135 before leasing it back			0
that back story was why @entity138 ’s @entity3 win was welcomed with emotional scenes in the @entity4 winner ’s enclosure			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it was tough			1
i would never have walked away because i ca n’t do anything else			0
but i got down big time			0
my wife @entity144 was a huge positive			0
i did lose confidence and doubted myself big time			0
‘ when i started training it was boom time			0
you did n’t have to sell yourself			0
i was having had that success it was tough and was spoilt			0
‘ in racing success breeds success but i am the world ’s worse at selling myself			0
it is like chatting up a girl who is not interested			0
’ it is hard not to be interested now			0
many clouds , who will have a @entity95 entry as a back - up to his potential @entity6 bid , would be only a second @entity6 runner for his trainer			1
the first was 1990 @entity170 winner @entity171 , who was pulled up behind @entity173			0
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity174 is a better horse than him			1
it is a very open race this year			0
( @entity179 ) @entity178 has to prove himself around @entity68 and the @entity180 have n’t got a stand out contender			1
many clouds has improved every chase he has run			2
