to wear the clothes i like ; even if my spirit roams naked			0
' my choice ; to be a size 0 or a size 15			0
they do n’t have a size for my spirit , and never will , ' to use cotton and silk to trap my soul is to believe that you can halt the expansion of the universe			0

@entity94 writer @entity96 wrote in a blog post : ' when it says " @entity100 , my mind , my choice " , what is the video really trying to convey ? whose choice ? urban women ? educated urban women ? educated , working urban women ? is there any choice for those unexposed to this video ? no ! ' there are thousands of women in lanes and by - lanes of cities and villages of @entity94 who do n't have a choice			1
choice is too fancy a word for them			0
they just take orders and obey			0
' they take orders in every step of their lives as their choices are not for themselves alone , but for their families as well			0
' are they wrong in thinking beyond themselves ? are they wrong , if they chose to compromise to make room for those they love ? these are far more real choices , much more significant than clothes and sex			0
