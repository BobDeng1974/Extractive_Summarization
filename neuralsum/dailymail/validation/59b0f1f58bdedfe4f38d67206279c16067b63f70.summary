despite a promising league position and a place in the @entity3 a real possibility , @entity0 appear to have had a solid season - but their misfiring strikers continue to be a hot topic			2
@entity8 is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of @entity0 deciding not to sign @entity15 on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances			1
club legend @entity18 formed a formidable partnership with @entity20 during their years at the @entity22 and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at @entity30			1
@entity18 scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for @entity0 and sir @entity33 speaking to the @entity34 he said : ' i 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before things click , but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen			1
for me and ( @entity45 ) @entity44 , we were blessed , as we had the likes of @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 providing the ammunition			0
it was dead easy for us , we just had to put the ball in the net			0
they were magical times and we had many magical moments			0
' hopefully the same thing can happen again for this @entity0 side			0
' @entity20 and @entity18 were formidable but had @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity48 providing them @entity60 is the clubs current top - scorer with 11 goals in all competitions , with the @entity66 captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months			1
with @entity69 recently suffering an injury , @entity18 feels that @entity60 and @entity15 could be the pairing to set @entity30 alight again			1
he said : ' @entity0 have world class strikers in the likes of @entity60 , @entity69 and @entity15 , but they do n't seem to have found the ideal combination			2
@entity60 is the clubs top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions despite playing recently in midfield @entity15 has failed to impress at @entity0 and was hauled off against @entity80 in the @entity81 ' @entity60 and @entity82 as a pairing has n't really clicked , so maybe a @entity60 - @entity15 combo might provide the answer for @entity0 long - term			2
' the former @entity86 international was also keen to pass on some words of wisdom to @entity90 and the @entity0 players with a place at @entity93 just one win away			0
' go out and express yourselves ! ' @entity69 has found it hard to click with @entity60 and has struggled since his blistering first season			0

@entity0 have struggled to win the fans over since @entity8 's *tenure* started at the club despite being fourth in the table
@entity18 feels their current crop of forwards have n't clicked yet
@entity18 and @entity20 were formidable at @entity0 and the club legend feels they need to find that winning formula like he had with his strike partner
