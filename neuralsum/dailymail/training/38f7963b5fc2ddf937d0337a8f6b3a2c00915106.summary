by @entity0 published : 15:45 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 15:47 est , 26 june 2013 disgraced congressman @entity1 is frontrunner in @entity3 's mayoral race @entity1 did n't stay up for very long			1
the former @entity5 congressman who wants to be @entity3 's next mayor had a five percentage point lead in a @entity11 - @entity10 @entity3 - @entity9 poll released tuesday			1
but on wednesday afternoon , a @entity13 poll showed he was trailing the openly gay city council speaker @entity14 by 2 points			1
@entity16 has the support of 19 per cent of registered @entity18 in @entity3 , compared to 17 per cent for @entity1 and 16 per cent for former city comptroller @entity19			1
the @entity20 is calling those results ' a three - way tie ' since the poll 's statistical margin of error is 3.4 percentage points			1
fully 28 percent of @entity18 polled said they have n't yet made up their mind about whom they 'll support in the september 10 primary contest			0
if @entity1 should emerge on top , it would cap an improbable political comeback from the depths of disgrace just a few years ago			0
the then - newlywed congressman resigned in disgrace after confessing that he tweeted indecent photos of himself to women who were not his wife			0
that acknowledgement followed weeks of false denials prompted by a relentless campaign from the late conservative firebrand @entity45			0
former @entity5 congressman @entity1 with his wife @entity47 in @entity48 in @entity3 @entity1 is married to @entity47 , a former @entity49 insider who was a close adviser to former secretary @entity50			2
his campaign has been based on the hope that @entity3 will give him a second chance			0
although @entity1 's numbers are soft , he would still claim @entity56 if he were the @entity18 nominee , the @entity13 poll shows			1
as the @entity18 ' standard - bearer , @entity1 would collect 36 per cent of the overall election day votes			2
@entity59 , who will run as an independent , would get 27 per cent for second place			0
city council speaker @entity14 is in the running for @entity3 mayor			1
on the same question , @entity16 would still win , but with just one more percentage point than @entity1 -- 37 per cent			2
@entity1 is also under water on @entity3 @entity18 ' favorable - versus - unfavorable views of him			1
he has a 37 per cent favorability rating among all @entity3 , according to the new @entity13 poll , but 43 per cent of them find him unfavorable			1
in march 2009 , his favorable / unfavorable numbers were 31 per cent and 13 per cent , respectively			0
even among @entity18 alone , fewer than half -- 44 per cent -- like @entity1			2
@entity14 's number on that score is 52 per cent			0
the only subset of @entity18 voters in which half have a favorable impression of the former congressman is african - americans , 50 per cent of whom have positive things to say about him			2
that could signal @entity1 's campaign to spend more time and money in parts of the city where black turnout is high			0
' former comptroller @entity19 ’s spurt – no doubt spurred in part by his endorsement last week by the @entity93 – is the big news in this new poll , ' said @entity96 , director of the @entity20 ' the other news is council speaker @entity14 ’s slide and that ’s more puzzling			1
a few polls ago , she was edging close to the magic 40 percent			0
now she ’s down with the guys			0
' @entity96 also noted that @entity1 , whose online @entity103 dalliances and serial fibbing made him the butt of jokes , ' does almost as well among women as @entity16			2

@entity11 - @entity10 @entity3 - @entity9 poll had him up by five per cent over city council speaker @entity14 just *24* hours ago
now @entity1 is trailing by 2 percentage points in a @entity13 poll that found only 17 per cent of registered @entity18 support him
most @entity115 @entity18 are still undecided
the married @entity1 was *drummed* out of the @entity117 after he *covered* up his use of @entity103 to send pictures of his *privates* to women
