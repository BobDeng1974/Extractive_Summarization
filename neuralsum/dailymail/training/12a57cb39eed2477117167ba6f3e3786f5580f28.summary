slept badly ? had strange dreams ? blame the moon			1
people have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon , a @entity3 study found			1
the content of our dreams does n’t vary with the seasons or with the days of the week , it showed			2
but in the week or so surrounding a full moon , they are decidedly more ‘ weird and bizarre ’			1
psychologist @entity15 made the surprise discovery as he analysed the experiences of 1,000 volunteers who were played sounds as they slept			1
people have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon , a @entity3 study found he said : ‘ for instance , someone might dream that they are flying on a dragon , then get off the dragon and go and have a cup of coffee with @entity30			1
some people dreamt they were superheroes			0
‘ they thought they were @entity34 or @entity35 , fighting crime			0
whereas most dreams were very pedestrian , things like being in the office all day , typing			0
’ the findings build on @entity43 research last year which found we take longer to fall asleep , sleep for 20 minutes less and sleep less soundly at full moon			1
production of the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin is also altered			0
professor @entity15 believes that this may disturb our dreams			1
another , stranger explanation is that we evolved to be sensitive to the moon ’s rhythms			0
according to this theory , sleeping lightly at the full moon would have made us more alert to predators , who might take advantage of the stronger moonlight to go hunting			1
study concluded the ' completely bizarre ' finding while analysing the dreams of people who listened to sounds as they slept our ancestors may also have hunted when the moon was full , with the result that we still find it hard to settle on bright nights			1
while professor @entity15 is n’t convinced by the evolutionary explanation , he does acknowledge that the moon seems to affect our sleep			1
he suggests those with a partner who is particularly affected make use of the sofa or spare room during a full moon			1
he made the ‘ completely bizarre ’ finding while analysing the dreams of people who listened to sounds as they slept			2
half a million people took part using a free mobile phone app that plays a range of noises			0
the user sets an alarm , and if the phone ’s motion sensor detects that they are dreaming in the 40 minutes before the alarm is due to go off , the sounds are played			0
after the alarm goes off , they are asked to record their dream			0
we are most likely to remember dreams from just before waking			0
a study of 1,000 such records showed that hearing birdsong or rustling grass led to dreams about greenery and flowers , while the squawk of seagulls led to thoughts of days at the beach			2
car horns and traffic provoked unsettled dreams			0
professor @entity15 , who describes his findings in his book @entity117 , said having more uplifting dreams has advantages beyond leaping out of bed in a good mood			2
he said : ‘ we have discovered a way of giving people sweet dreams , and this may also form the basis for a new type of therapy to help those suffering from certain psychological problems , such as depression			2
’ people who are depressed dream more than others , probably because their brain is using the downtime to work through their concerns			0
the hope is that better dreams will make it easier for them to rationalise their worries and so improve their health .			0
