by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 20 november 2013 a cash - strapped council has been attacked for installing expensive bins that cost £ 5,000 each , provide free wifi and send a text message when they 're full			1
@entity7 in west @entity8 , which must make £ 9.5million in cuts by 2015 , is under fire after setting up five ' @entity12 ' solar - powered bins in seaside locations at a time when it is cutting teaching jobs , and has to dig deep even to fund public toilets			1
the hi - tech ' compacter ' bins use energy from the sun to crush waste put inside it , which its makers claim gives it between six and eight times the capacity of a regular bin			1
councils in @entity39 and @entity40 have already trialled the devices			0
it has been claimed the bins will save more than three times as much as they cost , but local people have attacked them as a waste of public money that could be better - spent elsewhere			1
in @entity50 , one of the towns which now has a @entity12 , local representatives complained that the money could be better - spent keeping public toilets open			1
councillor @entity55 said : ' we have to pay £ 4,000 to keep our public toilets open yet they are spending £ 5,000 on a bin			2
' i know it is different funding pots but it ’s still public money			0
' however , according to claims by @entity69 , which distributes the bins in the @entity71 , the bins will in fact the council money by reducing how often collections need to be made			2
the devices , which cost £ 21 per week each to lease , are said to save £ 77 , reduce the number of bin collections needed by more than 70 per cent and scare off vermin			1
as the bins do not leave their rubbish exposed to the elements they are also said to cut the number of pests , as well as the problem of overflowing			0
the ability of the bins to text and email when they are full is also said to eliminate ' milk - round ' stye collections , as collectors will only need to empty the bins when they know they are nearly full			0
a @entity37 spokesman said : ' bins in coastal towns , especially @entity31 , @entity93 , @entity50 and @entity94 , experience heavy use during the tourist season			0
' much of the litter is fast food litter that is bulky and attracts seagulls and rats			0
the innovative @entity91 compress the litter using solar power			1
the bins can hold six to eight times more waste than the average bin			1
pilot : one of the bins has been installed by the @entity108 in @entity31 , pictured ' the bins also eliminate smells and do not attract vermin			0
the bin will send an email and text when it has reached 85 per cent capacity			0
' this means it can be emptied when needed rather than having to empty bins on a ‘ milk - round ’ type basis			2
' @entity120 has been under fire recently for implementing spending cuts , including one of £ 210,000 to school budgets , which will cost five teachers their jobs			2
budget announcements last month revealed that @entity7 would lose almost £ 5million in funding			1
the council 's leader said at the time that the cut was ' unprecedented ' and would prompt tough choices			0
@entity37 councils have faced less pressure in the past years to save money than @entity137 counterparts , and have kept the ability to hike council tax by as much as 5 per cent a year to make ends meet			2
@entity7 has increased council tax by 3 per cent per year every year since 2011 , which has helped it to avoid making the severe cuts seen elsewhere			1
but in the @entity37 's draft budget this year it was made clear that councils would have to make significant savings			0
@entity7 was given a 4.6 per cent cut , roughly £ 5million			1
taking inflation and existing spending plans into account , it will have to make £ 9.5million of cuts in the next tax year to balance its books			1
the change will be even more severe after the rural council 's share of central government funding was revised down due to its declining population			0
when the cuts were announced , council leader @entity159 said : ' we will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services , and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut			2
' the council is still deciding exactly what will be done to make the savings , but it has been suggested that libraries , refuse collection and public toilets will be in the firing line			0

@entity7 in @entity8 has installed five of the ' @entity12 ' bins
they cost £ 1,000 a year each , run on solar power , and beam out free wi - fi
manufacturers claim they hold eight times as much as than a *normal* bin
but local representatives *questioned* the squeezed council
@entity7 is facing a £ 5million funding cut in the next tax year
but combined with inflation and current spending *commitments* , this means finding £ 9.5million of cuts
