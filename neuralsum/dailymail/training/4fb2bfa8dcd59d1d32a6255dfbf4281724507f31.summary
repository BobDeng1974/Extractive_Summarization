by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 22 june 2012 there ’s a disturbing new theory behind the @entity4 ’s lack of success in the @entity7 - racism			1
senior figures linked to a number of former @entity4 entries have told me they experienced racism behind the scenes and were openly told that acts ­ featuring ethnic minorities would not be supported by many of the voting nations			1
since 2005 , @entity4 acts including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 have done badly in the contest , despite strong performances			1
fair play ? @entity19 was one @entity4 star who flopped now several industry figures are pressing the @entity27 to cut ties with the competition for good			2
one entry tells me : ‘ we were told repeatedly when we were touring our song around @entity33 that we did n’t have a chance because of the race factor			1
‘ we did n’t believe it at the time			2
then on the night our vote was very low in certain countries			2
@entity39 were very open that there is a track record for some nations refusing to cast votes for acts featuring ethnic minorities			1
‘ we found the entire experience devastating and strongly believe the @entity4 needs to withdraw			2
’ @entity21 , left , and @entity20 , right , have both flopped at @entity7 a manager of another former @entity4 hopeful says : ‘ when we returned home and everyone was asking us what went wrong , it did n’t feel right to mention the race factor but it ’s well known in the industry the impact it has on votes			1
’ even @entity60 is believed to have been caught up in the @entity7 race debate			1
he co-wrote the song that @entity21 , who has a @entity64 mother , came fifth in 2009			2
a member of the @entity4 camp that year adds : ‘ @entity21 won a tv talent show in the @entity4 to perform @entity60 ’s song			1
@entity60 lobbied for her around the @entity7 countries before the contest			1
at least once he was asked at a press conference why he had ' cast a black girl ' because it meant he could never win			1
‘ he was so shocked , he had to ask several times for a translator to repeat the question			2
’ this week , pop flop @entity76 ruled herself out of being our next @entity7 entry , and song contest sources pointed out the @entity4 has struggled with all - white acts @entity82 and @entity83 in recent years — and tv ratings have stayed stable , despite the results			1
a @entity27 spokesman said : ' the @entity27 is committed to @entity7 and has no evidence of any ­ racism around the event			1
' @entity90 is at the top of every tv boss 's wish - list @entity90 is at the top of the presenting wish - lists of @entity27 and @entity97 bosses — but she ’s not taking on any new work after her marriage split			2
my source says : ‘ @entity90 is hot property			0
everyone wants to get her for a big show			0
she ’s always been popular with broadcasters			0
’ but after @entity90 ’s ­ husband @entity106 walked out on her in april — on her ­ birthday — a pal says : ‘ she just needs some time to get her head together			0
‘ it ’s not about work right now , regardless of what offers come in			0
’ hard - up @entity27 bosses have confirmed that the saturday night tv series @entity117 has vanished from our screens			0
i ’m told the decision to axe the show was a major surprise to producers of the series — in which magicians taught celebrities how to perform elaborate tricks on live tv — but the @entity27 needs to save money after committing £ 25 million to flop show @entity130 for two years			2
a show source tells me : ‘ this is a huge disappointment			0
viewers loved @entity117 and on some nights we got more viewers than @entity130 , despite far less promotion			0
’ the @entity27 and producers @entity138 said last night : ‘ we can confirm that a third series will not be commissioned by the @entity27			0
’ in this age of equal opportunities , @entity97 had to agree that women would be eligible to audition to play @entity144 in its upcoming @entity60 musical talent show superstar			1
so imagine the relief of show executives when only two out of more than 10,000 auditionees were female			0
both have now been ruled out — so the sex of @entity144 will not need to be adjusted for the upcoming @entity4 arena tour of the show			0
however , one of the women who auditioned for @entity60 and acclaimed director @entity157 wo n’t regret her efforts — the pair are ­ considering her for a role in another famous @entity162 musical , possibly @entity163			1
@entity164 was devastated when @entity165 revealed their romance in his book my show source reveals : ‘ searching for @entity144 on a tv talent show is ­ controversial enough before adding in a chance of a woman in the role			0
‘ but @entity60 and @entity157 eagerly watched both performances			1
one girl was so good @entity60 has asked that she be put forward for another one of his shows			1
’ it ’s not been decided if the ­ women ’s auditions will be screened when the show , hosted by @entity181 , begins next month			0
just one phone call from @entity165 could have got @entity164 back on the @entity183 judging panel			0
‘ @entity97 were desperate to get @entity164 back , ’ says my source			0
‘ @entity186 was only a fallback option , but @entity165 needed to pick up the phone to @entity164			0
' she was devastated that their relationship appeared in his biography , that needed to be resolved			0

@entity7 acts have experience racism behind the scenes
@entity60 told ' black acts wo *n't* win '
