@entity0 got straight back to business after their disappointing @entity3 exit as the squad remained in @entity5 overnight and held a session at @entity8 's training ground on thursday			1
@entity10 's side were dumped out by @entity5 after a 1 - 0 defeat at the @entity12 on wednesday night but were put through their paces ahead of a return to @entity17 action			1
the champions host @entity19 at the @entity20 on saturday lunchtime as they bid to get their title challenge back on track after a shock defeat by @entity25 last weekend			1
@entity0 players trained in @entity27 on thursday following their @entity3 exit the night before the @entity0 squad are put through their exercises at @entity8 's training ground in @entity5 the players were given no time to mull over their @entity33 exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs to find themselves on the wrong end a 3 - 1 aggregate result			1
after such a commanding performance by the @entity40 leaders captain @entity41 was forced to admit that @entity0 are still a long way behind the very best in @entity44			1
' the reality is they were a better team , there is no shame in admitting that			2
for me there is a big , big difference			0
' i will just mention @entity53 and @entity5 , and then there are the rest of the teams , with @entity57 probably in between			1
' ultimately we have always said our goal is to become as good as them , but it will take some time			0
goalkeeper @entity62 and captain @entity41 train ahead of their @entity17 return on saturday @entity64 shares a joke as @entity10 's side prepare to face @entity19 at the @entity20 on saturday ' @entity53 and @entity5 are not just @entity3 - winning teams , they are @entity70 - winning teams as well			1
they have generations that have played together a long time			0
' of course we want to make up the gap but you just have to be true to yourself			0
we have the ambition to be as good as they are one day , but it is not going to happen overnight			2
' @entity0 's exit meant that @entity80 will not have a representative in the quarter - finals of the @entity3 for the second time in three seasons			1
' the gap will eventually get closer , ' said @entity41			1
' whether it is @entity86 , @entity87 , ( @entity89 ) @entity88 , the gap will become closer and i just hope it is us that gets there the first			0
' @entity41 and @entity62 , who produced a fine goalkeeping display against @entity5 , take a break from training @entity0 were outplayed in the first leg at the @entity20 three weeks ago but had hoped @entity62 's late penalty save , which kept the score 2 - 1 , might have proved the tie 's turning point			1
it proved anything but as @entity5 dominated from the outset , hitting the post within moments through @entity109			1
@entity110 was at his inspirational best , setting up @entity112 's 31st - minute goal and generally running @entity0 ragged			2
it was remarkable the scoreline stayed at 1 - 0 , with @entity115 also hitting the woodwork twice and @entity80 goalkeeper @entity62 producing a series of stunning saves in one of the best performances of his career			2
@entity0 might have made the latter stages interesting had @entity123 not had a penalty saved by @entity125 but they could complain little about the result			2
@entity112 beat @entity62 with a brilliant lob over the @entity0 keeper to give @entity5 a 1 - 0 win at the @entity12 the @entity131 midfielder celebrates with his team - mates after opening the scoring the hosts asked about @entity62 's display , centre - back @entity41 said : ' it was phenomenal			1
on that side of the pitch i felt we had all the luck we needed to get a result			0
' it was probably just the penalty - if we had scored a goal it could have been a different game			0
it would have been a great way to get back into the tie and it would have been interesting to see what the last 15 minutes would have been like back at 1 - 1			0
' if you want to win against those teams you need a very special performance and a little bit of luck on your side			2
then you can beat them , but every team can lose			0
' despite progress always seeming unlikely , the defeat is another blow to @entity0 's morale after an indifferent spell in the @entity17			1
@entity165 disappointed after @entity3 exit @entity0 's players leave the @entity12 looking glum after being eliminated @entity110 tries to take the ball around the onrushing @entity0 goalkeeper @entity62 having fallen six points behind @entity87 , who have a game in hand , it now seems unlikely @entity0 can retain their title and their season is in danger of fizzling out			1
they could even face a battle to hold onto second place as the likes of @entity86 , @entity181 and @entity88 gear up for a strong finish			0
@entity41 is determined to ensure that does not happen			2
the 28 - year - old said : ' forget about @entity87			0
we owe it to ourselves , to our fans to have a good end to this campaign			0
then again if we finish this campaign as good as we can , maybe there is still something in it			0
we will have to see			0
' it is not in our hands by any means , but we just have to go back and work hard and improve			0
