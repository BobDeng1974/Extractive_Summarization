by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 11 december 2013 @entity1 tonight blocked a bid by the @entity4 mp @entity3 to conduct a high - profile interrogation of the boss of @entity7			1
mr @entity3 had wanted his @entity9 committee to be allowed to question @entity10 over the damage caused by the @entity14 ’s @entity13 revelations			1
the session would have been guaranteed enormous tv coverage and publicity			2
@entity1 has blocked a bid to publicly interrogate the boss of @entity7 over the @entity13 leaks but , to the fury of mr @entity3 , the home secretary has intervened to stop the committee ’s plans			1
at the same time , prime minister @entity24 refused a similar request for the national security adviser to give evidence			2
mr @entity3 responded by threatening to haul mrs may before his committee more often			1
the row centres on the decision by the @entity14 to print intelligence secrets stolen by the fugitive @entity34 operative @entity13 , who is currently holed - up in @entity36			0
@entity3 wanted to question the head of @entity7 over the impact that @entity14 's publishing of the leaks had on the agency mr @entity10 says that , by disclosing surveillance techniques used by spies to monitor emails and the internet , the newspaper has handed a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists and put lives at risk			1
some @entity4 mps are keen for him to give specific examples			0
in an historic first , mr @entity10 – flanked by the heads of @entity54 and @entity55 - gave evidence to @entity9 ’s @entity57 on the subject last month			2
the @entity57 is conducting its own probe into @entity13 and yesterday announced a ‘ call for evidence ’ on whether the right balance is being struck between privacy and national security			0
@entity65 , the editor of the @entity14 newspaper , carried a copy of @entity69 's book spycatcher as he arrived to be questioned by the committee on december 3 but mr @entity3 decided his committee should have its own turn at quizzing mr @entity10 , and issued a formal invite last week			1
mrs may , who is the cabinet minister in charge of @entity7 , yesterday intervened to block the request			2
she said any appearance would ‘ duplicate ’ the existing oversight provided by the @entity57			0
a similar request for @entity80 , the prime minister ’s security adviser , to give evidence was blocked by mr @entity24			0
he said ‘ it was not a good idea ’ because mr @entity80 's role focused on providing private advice to him			0
the @entity87 and @entity88 were concerned about setting a ‘ precedent ’ in which mr @entity3 and mps could regularly haul security chiefs in front of the cameras			2
mr @entity24 said it should be left to the home secretary to give evidence to the @entity90 over the @entity13 row			1
she is due to appear before mr @entity3 ’s committee on monday			1
mr @entity3 responded : ‘ i am disappointed by the prime minister ’s and home secretary ’s responses , which are not helpful to the @entity57 ’s inquiry into @entity105			1
‘ we can not play pass the parcel on the issue of accountability on these important issues			0
‘ ministers should take care not to dictate to @entity113 which witnesses can be called and for what reasons			0
witnesses , no matter how senior , should not be afraid of answering questions from @entity90			0
‘ as a result of this correspondence our session with the home secretary next monday will be longer and more detailed than we originally anticipated , and she needs to prepare to come before the @entity57 more often			1
’ former @entity123 spy agency contractor @entity13 who leaked classified information to @entity14 @entity125 , legal director at human rights charity @entity126 said : ‘ this is a scandalous attempt by the government to insulate itself and the security services from anything even approaching genuine accountability			0
‘ @entity1 ’s claim that the @entity57 is providing real “ oversight ” would be laughable were it not so depressing			0
‘ this is a committee which has missed every scandal from @entity136 complicity in rendition and torture to the more recent revelations on excessive surveillance			2

@entity3 wanted the committee to be able to question @entity10
but the home secretary has *stepped* in to block the plans
