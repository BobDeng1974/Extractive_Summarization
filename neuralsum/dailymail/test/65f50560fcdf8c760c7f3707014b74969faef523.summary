baggage handlers at @entity1 have been caught on video as they steal items from passenger luggage			1
the @entity5 set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft , and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft 's belly			2
this as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $ 2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014			1
incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that @entity24 's @entity34 , which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country			2
in 2013 , @entity39 set up a hidden camera at that airport , and found workers stealing cash , jewelry , iphones and @entity46 , which led to six arrests			0
across the country in @entity50 , 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed			2
' we cut theft in those two terminals by 60 % because of doing that aggressive investigative work , ' said @entity62 , the police chief at that airport			0
overall , there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010 , with most of these coming from checked luggage			1
of those claims , 2,493 occurred at @entity23			0
airline customers have reported $ 2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 ( above a @entity23 employee ) most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal , with only @entity75 and @entity1 screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only @entity1 screening them when they leave			1
since 2002 , the @entity79 has fired 513 workers for theft , though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges			1
@entity62 believes that theft is not the only problem either , as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation 's airports			0
' i absolutely think that if we do n't pay attention to the small things that happen around here , that it could lead to much larger things			0
so there is , i believe , a connection between baggage theft and terrorism			0
