by @entity0 for the @entity1 if your walls are covered in your child ’s drawings , they may be worth a closer look			0
because artistic talent early in life provides an indicator of intelligence later on , scientists have found			1
children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years , according to a paper published today			1
psychologists at @entity18 studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four - year - olds			1
those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later			1
drawings of more than 15,000 children were graded for the study each drawing was given a grade between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head , nose , ears , hair , body and arms			1
the scoring system ignored features such as proportion for the study the research , conducted on 7,750 pairs of identical and non-identical twins , also found a strong link between genetics and artistic talent			1
identical twins were much more likely to draw pictures of a similar quality than non-identical twins			1
dr @entity53 , of the @entity54 at @entity18 , said : ‘ our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life			1
‘ through drawing , we are attempting to show someone else what ’s in our mind			0
' this capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability , in a similar way to writing , which transformed the human species ’ ability to store information and build a civilisation			2
’ however , she added : ‘ but this does not mean parents need to worry			0
it is really important that parents do not think , “ oh no , my child is terrible at drawing , they will be flipping burgers for the rest of their life			0
” each drawing was given a mark out of ten			0
the one on the left was given a four while the one on the right a ten more than 15,000 children , all aged four , were asked to draw a picture of a child for the @entity18 study there are countless factors , both genetic and environmental , which affect intelligence in later life			1
‘ drawing ability does not determine intelligence			2
the findings show there is a link , but it is only a moderate link			2
’ the children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child			2
each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head , nose , ears , hair , body and arms			0
the scoring system ignored features such as proportion , but the children were given a point for including clothing			2
the children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing , and again at the age of 14			1
the researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores			2
while some drawings received a 0 ( left ) , others were marked up because of their knowledge of features ( right ) dr @entity53 , of the @entity54 at @entity18 ( pictured ) , said of the study : ‘ our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life ' dr @entity53 added : ‘ there is no evidence that drawing makes you more intelligent			1
but i think drawing will make a child more observant and able to pay attention to what is around them			0
‘ children love drawing ; give them a crayon and let them get on with it			0
’ her team also tested the link between genes and artistic talent , using twins because each pair has a similar background , allowing the scientists to disregard outside influences			1
' overall , drawings from identical twin pairs were more similar to one another than drawings from non-identical twin pairs			0
dr @entity53 said : ‘ this does not mean there is a drawing gene – a child ’s ability to draw stems from many other abilities , such as observing			0
' we are a long way off understanding how genes influence all these different types of behaviour			0
’ the research is published in the journal @entity189 .			0

children who can depict human form at age of four more likely to be brighter
psychologists at @entity18 analysed 15,000 pictures by children

research on 7,750 twins also found strong link between genetics and talent
