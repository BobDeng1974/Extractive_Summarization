by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 9 may 2013 @entity2 council workers painted two sets of double yellow lines down a cycle path which is too narrow for a car to squeeze down			1
motorists in @entity8 were baffled when the lines appeared down both sides of the 136cm wide lane which motorists could n't park in even if they wanted to			1
the average width of a five - door hatchback such as a @entity15 is 174cm , so would be unable to get down the path			1
tight squeeze : the cycle lane with double yellow lines in @entity8 is just 136cm wide and is too narrow for cars to get down cycle lane : the path can not fit a car down it - but the council insist the lines are needed to protect cyclists in @entity8 however the council insist the lines are necessary to protect cyclists			1
@entity30 , service manager for traffic and safety from @entity33 , said : ' we realise how this may look peculiar to the casual observer , but we are committed to making @entity8 accessible and safe for cyclists			1
' sadly , sometimes drivers park half or wholly on pavements making it difficult for cyclists and pedestrians			2
' for the avoidance of doubt and so that we can enforce the restrictions , we have placed yellow lines on both sides of the track			0
' this covers the whole area from the centre line of the track all the way back to the building line			0
measured up : the lane is just 136cm wide so even a small car like a @entity15 at 174cm wide will not squeeze down ' we hope this prevents further parking in this area and keeps things accessible for cyclists and pedestrians			1
' but @entity61 , director of a property advising firm which faces the road , said : ' parking in @entity8 is bad enough but this is just bonkers			2
clearly anyone who could wedge a car in that gap deserves a ticket			0
' but when you look i 'm not even sure a smart car could find its way in there			0
i just think that it is rules gone mad and clearly a waste of time and money			0
' people are being pushed into car parks because free areas are constantly being restricted			0
' some of the car parks are ridiculously expensive and a lot of people do n't see they have any other choice but to use them			0
' parking in the city needs to be made easier or else we will start pushing people away			0
' only the world 's smallest car could fit down the road - the @entity93 , which is just 99cm wide			2
narrow : this path is clearly too narrow for a car to fit down - and has been criticised by local residents in @entity8 tight spot : locals have accused the council of wasting money by painting the lines down the narrow cycle path			1

cycle lane is just 136cm wide while a @entity15 is 174cm
@entity33 say double yellows are needed to ' make @entity8 safe for cyclists '
