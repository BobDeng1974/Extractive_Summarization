by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 20 march 2012 @entity3 could face another house price boom , fuelled by the ageing population and the rising number of immigrants , a @entity2 expert said yesterday			1
in a research paper , professor @entity8 predicted ‘ a rising trajectory for real house prices ’			0
his report comes as the average asking price in one exclusive corner of @entity15 , the @entity16 , hit £ 2million for the first time			1
a decade ago , the average asking price in the area was £ 650,600 , which means it has trebled in ten years			1
house prices have recorded their biggest ' spring bounce ' in eight years , fuelling hopes that the property market will be more robust in 2012 than last year professor @entity8 , who sits on the @entity2 ’s interest rate - setting monetary policy committee , also warned that changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch meant that young people will have to wait longer before they can afford to buy a home because they will be saving for a larger deposit			1
@entity35 prices have dropped since the last boom , but professor @entity8 said : ‘ the trend of rising real incomes and the likelihood of rising population density means we should anticipate a rising trajectory for real house prices over the longer term			0
‘ this is particularly likely in a country like the @entity3 where population density looks set to rise relatively fast			0
’ he singled out the ageing population , with one in six people currently alive in the @entity3 expected to celebrate their 100th birthday , as well as the growing number of immigrants			0
@entity15 asking prices reached a new high of £ 455,159 , up 7.3 per cent year - on - year and all 10 regions in @entity54 and @entity55 recorded monthly price rises this month at present , 62.2million people live in @entity3 , but the @entity58 expects this number to balloon			1
by 2020 , it is expected to hit 67.2million , rising again to 71.4million by 2030 , according to the @entity58 ’s latest population estimates			0
the prospect of a further rise in house prices will be a cause for celebration for millions of homeowners , but a blow for an equal number trying to get onto the housing ladder			2
over the past 25 years , house prices have reached levels which leave many people unable to afford to buy their own home			2
in 1986 , the average home in a @entity3 city cost £ 35,209			1
today the same property would cost around £ 170,000			2
in his report on population growth , house prices and mortgages , professor @entity8 also painted a dramatic picture of how fundamental changes to the mortgage industry since the credit crunch will affect young people			0
@entity87 : @entity88 , in @entity89 , where homes easily sell for over £ 2 million he said the mortgage market has changed in a ‘ permanent ’ and ‘ very abrupt ’ way which has been ‘ stark , particularly for new buyers ’			1
professor @entity8 said : ‘ the first effect is likely to be prospective buyers postpone their purchase , while they save more to accumulate a larger deposit			2
‘ as a result , the average age at which people would buy their first home will rise , and the share of owner - occupied houses will fall			1
’ the average age of a first - time buyer is currently 29 , but this is heavily skewed by the fact that many only managed to buy after getting help from their parents			1
professor @entity8 said the change in the mortgage market is not a bad thing			2
he said the fact that banks and building societies insist on large deposits to get the best loan deals is not the sign of a damaged market , or one which is not functioning properly			0
he singled out the 100 per cent mortgage deals , prevalent during the last boom , which allowed people to buy without saving a penny for a deposit			0
record highs : the average asking prices in west @entity15 's @entity133 and @entity89 have surged past £ 2m for the first time professor @entity8 said : ‘ it probably never made sense for there to be 100 per cent mortgages			1
‘ there may be no price at which it makes commercial sense for such a loan to be available			0
’ the report comes at a time when soaring numbers of families are being forced to rent because they can not afford to buy			0
the government ’s @entity148 shows 16.5 per cent of households in @entity54 are renting their home privately , the highest number since the 1970s			1
meanwhile , the number of homeowners is falling			0
of the 21.9million households in @entity54 , 66 per cent own their home , compared with 70.9 per cent in 2003 , the year that it peaked			2
by comparison , the number of private rents has jumped from two million in 2000 to 3.6million in 2010			0
@entity161 , from the first - time buyer campaign group @entity160 , warns : ‘ a new generation of families will be growing up in insecure rented accommodation			1
‘ they will face the possibility of eviction at short notice , making it much harder to settle down and have stability in where your children go to school or nursery			0

all 10 regions in @entity54 and @entity55 record monthly price rises this month
warnings that the *recovery* remains patchy and market is still ' very *sensitive* ' to *external* *influences*
average price of home in @entity133 and @entity89 tops £ 2million
first - time buyers face ' double blow ' with end of stamp duty *holiday* and 3 *%* target price leap
