so sometimes it must be nice for the @entity23 to be the one behind the camera – as these pictures prove			2
@entity5 took the photographs in september , when she and prince @entity9 visited @entity27 , and they were published on the couple ’s website , www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org , yesterday			1
@entity5 and @entity9 spent a day at the @entity30 to highlight the work being undertaken to protect the rainforest and its wildlife , including the orang - utan			1
a keen amateur : the duchess of @entity37 taking aim on a previous trip the @entity27 rainforest is one of the oldest rainforests in the world and the @entity44 and @entity23 visited it during their @entity47 tour to @entity48 and the @entity49 the pictures capture the couple 's awesome surroundings in the jungle and include photographs taken on their private walks through the @entity27 forest as well as images captured while the @entity44 and @entity23 were flying to the @entity58			1
the couple travelled into the jungle to the research station in the @entity63 state of @entity64 where they were hoisted more than 40 metres up into the rainforest canopy to see the eco-system			2
they also saw orangutans during their time on the island and @entity5 captured one of the endangered species in silhouette			1
the trip to @entity27 took place at a testing time for the couple , in the midst of the publication of pictures of the @entity23 sunbathing topless on holiday in @entity83			2
the @entity44 and @entity23 flew over this palm oil plantation on their way to the research station			0
these plantations are vital to the production of many products used in daily life , from cooking to biofuels the @entity27 rainforest provides natural habitats for many species of birds and animals			0
most notably the endangered @entity96			2
the @entity44 and @entity23 were fortunate enough to spot one during their short visit @entity98 of @entity37 , who is a keen photographer , took the shots on her own camera during the visit @entity103 is the highest point in @entity27 , this image was taken by @entity5 as the couple flew to the @entity58 the website was recently redesigned and it relaunched on novermber 3rd to coincide with the their @entity108 ’s @entity47 tour to @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
the site is designed to bring together information from three individual websites , www.princeofwales.gov.uk , www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org and www.princehenryofwales.org and features a ' life in pictures ' section with many rarely seen archive photos , a children 's section and even @entity121 clips			1
more features focusing on the many different elements of @entity108 ’s work and lives such as @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 of @entity44 and @entity23 and prince @entity129			2
the site was recently redesigned as a way to bring together information on the @entity44 and @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity23 and prince @entity129 and features a rarely seen archive photos , a children 's section and even @entity121 clips this picture was taken as @entity5 and @entity138 were travelling by car through the rain forest in @entity141 in @entity63 and does not even begin to give a sense of the size of these jungle giants , which are truly one of @entity147 's most awesome sights they follow the release yesterday of never - before - seen photographs of prince @entity9 in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot			1
there were red faces at the palace though as the publicity exercise back - fired as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four of the shots			1
the @entity159 was yesterday forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of @entity163 staff following the embarrassing security blunder			1
the pictures , taken by an @entity163 photographer , had been intended to show off a ‘ day in the life ’ of the prince on base as flight lieutenant @entity170 at @entity172 on @entity173 , north @entity170			2
this photo of a jungle clearing was taken by @entity98 during her and the @entity44 's private walk			1
in rare clearings , when the sunlight does shine though , it creates the most spectacular effect through the architectural structures of the trees and leaves this photograph was also taken on a private jungle walk			2
every tree is itself a kingdom of creatures and plant life with a surrounding atmosphere of light and noise and humidity @entity5 , who has a degree in the history of art , is a keen supporter of the arts as reflected in her first @entity197 and volunteer activities since becoming @entity23			1
it is understood her photos were taken on a @entity201 , which retails for about £ 285			0
in january she became patron of the @entity203 and her first official solo engagement without husband @entity9 was at a @entity207 preview at the gallery in february this year			1
she has also become a patron of the @entity210 , a charity that works with children to increase their self - esteem , self - confidence and independence through art. the charity ’s emphasis is on teaching life skills while encouraging children and young people to both relate and engage with each other			0
@entity222 has worked as a @entity224 staff photographer on two national titles for over 30 years			0
in that time he has travelled the world covering major news stories , royal tours & celebrity events			0
he says : ‘ it ’s a good first effort and full marks to her for putting them out there and inviting critique , that is very brave as an amateur , but technically they are not brilliant			0
‘ it looks like the pictures have all been take in colour and then turned to black and white , meaning they lose a lot of impact			0
‘ she was in a lush rainforest in a beautiful part of the world which would have been filled with amazing colours and shades so to lose all of that is a real shame			0
‘ black and white pictures can be more interesting but here it adds nothing to the picture			0
‘ my least favourite shot is the one of the orangutan – i thought @entity262 ’s @entity261 had curled up and died on film			0
‘ but some of the jungle shots are good , and she definitely shows potential			0
‘ my advice to her is to get some proper lessons from a professional photographer			0
‘ she is in such a privileged position and will spend the rest of her life travelling around the world with unique access to the most amazing sites , a few professional pointers would enable her to make the most of her potential			0
' the trip to @entity27 took place at a testing time for the couple , days earlier a @entity83 magazine had published pictures of the @entity23 sunbathing topless on holiday in @entity83			0
@entity5 , though remained cool and calm as she was pictured at the @entity287 in @entity288 before heading in to the jungle the royal couple were hoisted up a 42 metre rainforest tree during their visit ( this picture is not part of @entity5 's photography collection )			1
