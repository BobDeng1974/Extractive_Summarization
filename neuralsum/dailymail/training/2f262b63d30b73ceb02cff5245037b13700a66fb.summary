by @entity0 a £ 1 billion ' time machine ' , which could reveal mysteries of the universe , is finally complete			0
the last giant antenna for @entity5 , the world ’s largest land - based observatory , recently arrived in @entity8 allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before			1
it is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed			0
the last giant antenna ( pictured ) for @entity5 , the world 's largest land - based observatory , recently arrived in @entity8 allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before the @entity5 array is situated high on the @entity25 , a remote area of the @entity26 in northern @entity8 at 16,400 feet ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			1
there , the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky			0
with the latest arrival , the observatory combines the forces of 66 radio antennae , most almost 40 feet ( 12 metres ) in diameter			1
combined , they make the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles ( 15 km ) away			1

this is where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered , said project director @entity64 , who added @entity5 is poised to reach its full potential next year			1
‘ up to now @entity5 ’s observations and data were published with 16 to 20 antennae , now we 're going to have double that or more , hence there will be a jump in sensitivity : better , quicker and more data , ’ @entity64 said			1
i think there will be a real stream of scientific results in the coming months and years			0
’ the new dish is the 25th @entity79 antenna to be transported up to the observatory			2
it will work alongside 25 other antennae from @entity83 and four from @entity84 , as well as 12 smaller 22ft ( 7 metre ) dishes from @entity84			0
some of the @entity5 antennae bathed in red light			1
in the background there is the southern @entity90 on the left the $ 1.6 billion telescope , which began full - scale operation in march , has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the centre of the @entity90 's supermassive black hole			1
it also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star			0
by collecting radio waves rather than optical light , @entity5 can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space			2
this will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the @entity111			0
it can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed			0
this could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun , the planets and , eventually , humans			0
radio telescope antennas of the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) project the secret to @entity5 's incredible resolution comes from two factors : height and distance			1
the observatory 's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			2
this is far above most of @entity137 's atmosphere and water vapour , which obscures observations			0
astronomers working in @entity5 's facility at 9,500 feet ( 2,900 meters ) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays			1
the system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas			0
when the array is finished , there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km ( 9.9m ) apart			2
the antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually , then combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information about where the signals come from			0
researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us , but on a universe - size scale			2
this high - resolution not only lets @entity5 observe young planetary systems , but also pin down hydrogen and life - building blocks in gas clouds			2
the array can also track the evolution of galaxies .			0

last giant antenna for @entity5 recently arrived in @entity8 's @entity25
@entity5 is the world ’s largest land - based observatory and uses 66 antennae
@entity5 's antennae are accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles away
@entity5 began full - scale operation in march and it has already spotted a star formation near the centre of the @entity90 's supermassive black hole
scientists say the @entity5 array is poised to reach its full potential next year
