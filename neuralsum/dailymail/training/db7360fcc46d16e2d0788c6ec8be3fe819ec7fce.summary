with a $ 700,000 advance and a first run of 200,000 copies , gov. @entity1 's book turned in dismal first - week figures with less than 1,000 copies sold – but the @entity8 quarantines could pick up hisnumbers governor @entity1 is so sure @entity11 health care workers wo n't mind mandatory @entity8 quarantines that he 's giving them reading lists – starting with his own poorly selling memoir			1
' all things possible : setbacks and @entity17 ' sold just 945 hardcover copies during its first week , despite a $ 700,000 advance from @entity21 and a first print run of 200,000			1
@entity1 , well aware the book has quickly become a punch - line bookstore remainder , worked it into his remarks about @entity8 quarantines on monday – as a joke to soothe the tempers of @entity11 doctors and nurses who have returned from west africa only to find themselves confined to their apartments for three weeks			1
' i 'm asking those people who were in contact with infected people – stay at home for 21 days , ' he said			2
' ' you do n't have to read my book , ' @entity1 added after a comic beat			1
' but stay at home for 21 days			2
' ' all things possible ' has performed so abysmally at the cash register that @entity52 until sunday did n't have it listed as a top seller in any of its thousands of book categories			0
one accolade emerged monday morning : the @entity1 volume is ranked # 36 among books on leadership			2
but ranked ahead of him are a two - year - old tome titled ' @entity61 ' ; a three - year old remembrance of @entity64 dictator @entity63 ; and a four - year - old treatise by @entity66 titled ' @entity68 @entity67			0
' @entity1 ( left ) and @entity71 gov. @entity70 ( right ) have both run afoul of the @entity72 by instituting state - level quarantines for people who came into contact with @entity8 patients in @entity77 science lesson : @entity1 was at a @entity80 middle school on monday to ceremonially receive a statewide report on progress toward education goals @entity84 aside , @entity1 said he 's deadly serious about enforcing a quarantine policy that 's more sweeping than what the @entity72 , the federal government 's public health pronouncer , requires			1
' i disagree with the @entity72 , ' he told reporters monday after an appearance at a @entity80 middle school			0
' at the end of the day , i am the governor of the state of @entity11			2
i would rather be , in this situation , a little over-cautious			0
' and inconveniencing health care workers for three weeks , he said , ' is greatly outweighed , in my opinion , by the potential risk			1
' the policy @entity101 defended is the same one that got @entity70 , his counterpart in @entity71 , in hot water over the weekend			1
@entity103 , a @entity104 nurse who returned to the @entity105 from western @entity77 by way of @entity107 found herself in a hospital isolation tent for several days while @entity72 officials evaluated her symptoms			1
she had volunteered to treat @entity8 patients there , triggering the first of several conditions that made her subject to increased scrutiny upon her return			1
@entity103 was released monday and sent home to @entity104 at @entity71 taxpayers ' expense			2
but @entity70 insisted he had n't backed down			0
' i did n't reverse any decision , ' he told reporters in @entity125 , where he was campaigning with gov. @entity126			0
' if she was continuing to be ill she would have to stay , ' @entity70 said			0
' she had n't had any symptoms for 24 hours and she tested negative for @entity8 so there 's no reason to keep her			2
' if @entity103 had been a @entity71 , she would have been permitted to quarantine herself at home			2
the same policy is now in place in @entity11 , @entity133 , and – with some nuanced differences – in @entity135			0
' this is going to become a national policy eventually , ' @entity70 said monday			0
' eventually the @entity72 will come around			0
' @entity103 , a @entity104 nurse who returned to the @entity105 from western @entity77 by way of @entity107 , @entity71 , was kept in isolation against her will for several days no regrets : @entity70 said monday in @entity125 that he put the right policy in place , and denied reports that he took a u-turn to satisfy the @entity147 @entity1 , too , said he 's enforcing the same policy he started out with on friday			1
and he denied the @entity150 administration was leaning on him to come in line with the @entity72 's more relaxed , voluntary , guidelines			1
' there was no pressure from the @entity147 , ' he said , ' and as a matter of fact i am in disagreement with the @entity72 's policy – and i still am in disagreement with the @entity72 's policy			1
' @entity1 also said that public health workers check up on quarantined @entity163 twice every day at random times			1
' you 'd better be home when they come , ' he warned			0
' if you 're not home then you 've violated the quarantine			0
' the governor insisted that for @entity163 who fall in that category , there are legal measures at his disposal			0
' if – if people did n't comply , ' he said , ' by law we can mandate it			0
