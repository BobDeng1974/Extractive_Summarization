it is a remarkable , eye - popping portrait of @entity2 's first minister , @entity1			1
entitled ' @entity4 ' , the painting depicts her as a dominatrix in a short red dress , black suspenders on display and whip in hand			1
but instead of being offended , ms @entity1 is ' tickled ' by the image , so much so it is believed to grace the wall of her suburban @entity16 home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband , @entity18			1
he is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power			1
eye - popping : the painting allegedly hanging in the home of @entity28 leader @entity1 shows her as a dominatrix ( pictured ) couple : the image is said to grace the wall of @entity1 's ( left ) suburban @entity16 home after she was given it as a birthday gift by her husband , @entity18 ( right ) softly spoken , bespectacled and almost unknown outside the @entity2 political village , he can walk the busiest streets in @entity2 without being recognised			1
@entity28 colleagues reveal that within the party , @entity18 is affectionately nicknamed @entity39 , after @entity39 's loyal hamster sidekick in the 1980s cartoon series			1
@entity42 , myopic and chubby , @entity39 dutifully shouts ' coming chief ' , whenever his superior summons him in the cartoons			2
some say the similarity extends further			0
@entity1 does n't drive and her husband frequently acts as chauffeur			2
he also carries out the lion 's share of the domestic chores			0
when @entity53 's @entity52 remarked on the immaculate condition of the couple 's detached house last month , @entity1 , 44 , said : ' that 's because i had my husband up most of last night cleaning			1
' @entity2 's most powerful politician also leaves the cooking to her spouse , stating : ' i do n't cook			0
i have had lots of disasters and now i prefer not to try , but @entity18 is a good cook and enjoys it			2
' however , anyone assuming that @entity18 's only role is that of dutiful house - husband would be sorely mistaken			2
as chief executive of the @entity28 , he has transformed its fortunes , creating a formidable electoral machine			2
transition : @entity18 ( right ) is the man credited with transforming the nationalist leader ( left ) from surly apparatchik to national stateswoman – on the brink of holding the balance of power portrait : instead of being offended , ms @entity1 ( pictured ) is ' tickled ' by the image depicting her as a dominatrix in 2001 , when he took on the role , the party had a paltry 6,000 members ; today the @entity28 is the third - biggest party in the @entity87 , with a membership of 110,000			1
@entity18 , who earns about £ 120,000 a year , and his wife first met when ms @entity1 – an 18 - year - old firebrand left - winger – attended an @entity28 gathering which he helped to organise			1
they were married in 2010 with a wedding cake created by the @entity2 confectionery dynasty @entity93 's			0
so was @entity16 - based @entity96 artist @entity95 making her own comment on the @entity99 relationship when she dreamt up @entity4 in 2009 ? ' no , not at all , ' ms @entity95 , 35 told @entity100			0
' at the time she was very prominent , but i knew nothing about her partner			0
' her image was quite mousey and she often wore a red suit , so i just wanted to explore her sexy side			0
' mr @entity18 certainly liked what he saw and snapped up the work for £ 1,500			0
he said : ' @entity4 was tickled by the depiction			0
' perhaps he was following orders from the chief whip .			0
