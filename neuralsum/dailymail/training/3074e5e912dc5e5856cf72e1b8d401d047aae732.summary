the 41 - year - old computer technician , from @entity35 , @entity36 , accidentally took five times the fatal amount of the unregulated substance , known commercially as @entity39 , and never woke up			1
until now most legal highs have been designed deliberately to mimic existing banned substances , such as cocaine and @entity43 , but chemically just outside the control of the @entity45			1
but now ministers are worried about the development of chemicals created to replicate the effects of other @entity51 drugs			1
mr @entity14 said : ‘ the fact is there is a problem that has n’t yet been dealt with satisfactorily , both in this country and elsewhere			1
and that ’s a challenge which we collectively face			0
‘ in particular i ’m concerned by the shocking emergence of new substances designed to have similar effects to heroin and synthetic opiates , one of which was reported last month to have caused the tragic death of @entity29			1
tragic : @entity65 , 18 , from @entity66 , died last summer after taking a legal high he bought online ‘ we have a changing landscape in the drug world			1
the drugs which we have traditionally wrestled with , which have been there for decades if not longer , are now being added to by these new psychoactive substances			2
‘ it presents a challenge because if they are perceived to be legal and they suddenly arrive in our country before they have obviously been banned , then young people in particular can conclude that they are safe when they are nothing of the kind			2
’ he has now asked the @entity81 , which advises the government on whether a drug should be banned or reclassified , to study the developments			0

ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs , including mephedrone — known as meow meow — @entity112 and @entity113			0
but mr @entity14 said : ‘ if you ’re having new substances created almost on a weekly basis then inevitably we ’re chasing after those substances			2
’ he has also vowed to tackle the growing problem of ‘ head shops ’ which sell legal highs on the @entity122			0
