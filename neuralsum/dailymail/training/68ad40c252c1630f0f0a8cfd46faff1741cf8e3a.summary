by @entity0 , consumer affairs editor and @entity3 reporter published : 19:18 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 28 october 2013 a chronic lack of homes for sale is continuing to drive up house prices with a return of sealed bids and gazumping in some areas			0
the number of homes on the market has fallen by 1.6 per cent in the past month , however there was a 2 per cent increase in buyers registered with agents , according to research by @entity20			1
the situation is giving sellers , particularly those in @entity24 and the @entity25 , a strong hand , it said			2
this echoes a @entity29 report showing asking prices up by £ 220 per day in october to hit an average of £ 252,418 - largely driven by a @entity24 spike			1
in demand : the number of would - be buyers looking for properties like these ones in @entity38 and @entity39 , in north west @entity24 , has gone up six per cent month - on - month @entity20 said the percentage of the asking price now being paid by buyers is up to 95.2 per cent , which is second only to the figure of 95.7 per cent seen at the height of the 2007 property boom before the crash			1
there are fears that a new property bubble is being stoked by the addition of the government 's help to buy boosters to the cheap mortgage cash pushed by the @entity57 's funding for lending scheme			0
the market in @entity24 and the @entity25 are most at risk of seeing an artificial bubble as buyers , including wealthy foreigners with cash , battle for homes and flats before they are even built			1
nationally , prices have risen by 0.5 per cent in the past month , according to @entity20			1
however , the figure is a higher 0.7 per cent in the @entity25 and 0.8 per cent in @entity24			2
prices have risen by 3.1 per cent over the past year			2
it puts the annual rise in prices as lower than the @entity29 asking prices report , which showed them up 3.8 per cent over the past year			2
the most recent @entity75 monthly report showed house prices up 3.4 per cent in the year to september , while @entity77 reported a 6.2 per cent rise and @entity80 a 5 per cent increase over the same period			1
on the up : @entity83 prices are rising in more than a third of postcodes , while in most others they are stable and just 1.6 % saw a decrease			0
demand from prospective buyers in @entity24 surged by more than 6 per cent month - on - month , helping to maintain the upward pressure on prices			1
houses in @entity24 take just over four weeks to sell on average amid continued demand from wealthy overseas buyers in the capital , compared with slightly more than eight weeks across @entity96 and @entity97			1
sellers in the capital are typically achieving 97.2 per cent of their asking price , while the figure is 95.9 per cent in the @entity25			0
one of the major factors driving the turnaround in the property market this year has been a decline in mortgage rates and increase in availability			2
this has come as cheap money has filtered through banks and building society 's from the @entity57 's funding for lending scheme			0
for borrowers with the biggest deposits , two - year fixed rate mortgages have fallen below 2 per cent , while those with 25 per cent of a property 's value to put down can fix their mortgage for five years at less than 3 per cent			1
but savers have suffered as rates on accounts have plummeted due to lenders no longer needing to compete to get their cash in to fund mortgage lending			0
a separate study published by the @entity77 today found 70 per cent of the nation expects house prices to rise over the next year			0
@entity20 said the @entity130 was the only region not to see any change in prices over the month			0
prices increased by 0.1 per cent in the @entity133 and the @entity134 , by 0.2 per cent in @entity97 and @entity135 and @entity136 , by 0.3 per cent in @entity137 and the @entity138 , by 0.4 per cent in the @entity139			0
the situation is giving sellers , particularly in @entity24 and the @entity25 , a strong hand a new phase of the government ’s flagship help to buy scheme launched this month is set to inject further activity into the housing market as lenders offer state - backed mortgages to aspiring first - time buyers and home movers with deposits as low as 5 per cent			1
lenders representing most of the mortgage market have now come on board the scheme , although only state - backed lenders @entity157 ( @entity157 ) , @entity159 , @entity77 and @entity160 have unveiled their products under the initiative so far			0
in a sign that house prices could push up further amid surging buyer demand , the shortage of homes for sale continued in october as the number of new properties listed dropped by 1.6 % , while the number of new buyers registering with agents rose @entity174 , director of research at @entity20 , said that a ‘ chronic lack of supply ’ has been driving house price growth			1
he said : ‘ growth in new sales being agreed is running at 4 - 5 % per month and this is continually eroding the stock of homes for sale			2
‘ in contrast , levels of demand have grown by 3 % in the last two months			0
improving confidence amongst buyers has been fuelled by low mortgage rates and positive news on a recovering housing market			0

number of homes on the market has fallen by 1.6 per cent in past month
but a 2 per cent increase in buyers registered with agents
@entity24 saw demand rise 6 per cent month - on - month
