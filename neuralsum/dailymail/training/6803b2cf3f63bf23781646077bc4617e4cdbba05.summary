@entity1 chiefs have met supporters in a bid to improve the atmosphere at @entity5 , with proposals for designated singing sections and individuals to lead the songs			1
@entity10 complained last month that it was like playing in ‘ an empty stadium ’ and , though he apologised , the issue is being taken seriously in the boardroom			2
after meeting supporters ’ groups over the last month to canvass opinions , chairman @entity15 presented some of the ideas to the club ’s fans ’ forum in a meeting at @entity24			0
@entity10 said it was so quiet during the win over @entity27 that it was like playing at an empty stadium fans in the @entity30 are acknowledged to be the rowdiest at @entity5 @entity5 attracted a full house for the visit of @entity27 , but @entity10 was unhappy with noise levels @entity35 introduced a permanent singing section at @entity37 in april 2014			1

@entity35 's official website explained a singing section is designed to ' promote increased competition between the home and away fans '			2
@entity1 want to trial a new singing section in the @entity5 , which is shared with away supporters , in the hope it will spark more noise from other parts of the ground			1

the noisiest @entity1 fans are usually at the other end of the ground in the @entity30 , and another idea is to move away fans and create a second large groundswell of vocal support in the @entity5			1
away fans used to sit behind the dug - outs in the lower @entity68 but @entity10 complained in his first spell at the club that they were too close to him and could easily influence the linesman and fourth official			0
@entity1 may even consider moving the dug - outs across the pitch if the away fans are moved back and the manager is unhappy			0
such problems are by no means limited to @entity1			0
