about seven out of every eight @entity1 insurance customers who enrolled between november 15 and mid-december are poor enough to qualify for taxpayer - funded subsidies designed to lower their monthly premiums			1
the @entity4 reported that number tuesday , saying it 's up from 80 per cent a year ago			1
@entity7 who participate in government - brokered medical insurance can get subsidies from the federal treasury if their households earn less than four times the government 's official ' poverty ' level			1
that situation describes 64 per cent of all @entity7 residents , according to the @entity16			2
but far more are qualifying , suggesting that the @entity1 subscriber base is dramatically tilted toward low - income earners			2
and as poor @entity7 depend inreasingly on handouts to manage their monthly health insurance bills , the @entity7 @entity19 could be months away from invalidating the entire subsidy system that supports the 34 states that chose not to run their own @entity1 marketplaces			1
@entity26 : about 7 out of every 8 @entity1 enrollees will get a government subsidy to pay for part or all of their new medical insurance more expensive : with $ 65 billion in subsidies at risk , the @entity1 is falling short of fulfilling president @entity37 's pledge to lower costs outgoing @entity41 @entity40 rep. @entity39 estimated two weeks ago that as much as $ 65 billion in government payments to @entity7 in those states is at risk			1
the @entity19 case , @entity46 , hinges on whether the government can legally distribute subsidies in states that use the @entity51 online exchange instead of running their own			1
the law ’s language is plain : subsidies can only be paid through exchanges created by the states			0
democrats in @entity59 , defending president @entity37 's signature law , insist a drafting error is to blame			0
they say they intended for people in all 50 states to be eligible for subsidies			2
but @entity68 , the one - time @entity1 ' architect ' whose unguarded , videotaped comments about the law drove him to apologize before @entity59 this month , thought differently in 2012			2
' what ’s important to remember politically about this , ' @entity68 told a group of consultants at the management firm @entity76 , ' is if you 're a state and you do n’t set up an exchange , that means your citizens do n't get their tax credits – but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill			0
' ' so you ’re essentially saying [ to ] your citizens you ’re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country , ' he warned			0
' i hope that that 's a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges			0
' insurers are bracing for the possibility that 87 per cent of their new customers in the 34 states without insurance exchanges could suddenly find @entity1 policies financially out of reach – leading to lapsed premiums and a systemwide collapse			1
some companies have slipped excape clauses into their policy contracts , @entity105 reports , allowing them to cancel the plans if the high court invalidates the subsidies			0
tuesday 's @entity4 report included data from only one month ; the open enrollment period stretches through february 15			1
' about 87 percent of people who selected health insurance plans through @entity51 for coverage beginning jan. 1 , 2015 were determined eligible for financial assistance to lower their monthly premiums , ' the agency reproted , ' compared to 80 percent of enrollees who selected plans over a similar period last year			1
obamacare subsidies can come in the form of tax credits that compensate for varying percentages of premiums			0
they can also consist of government payments that directly lower enrollees ' out - of - pocket costs			2
tax credits are available to everyone earning less than 400 per cent of the poverty limit			0
those under 250 per cent of that benchmark can get the direct subsidies for ' silver ' level insurance policies			1
. the final cost of insurance is capped at 9.5 per cent of total income for anyone who qualifies			0
@entity7 can apply different levels of health insurance subsidies next year , depending on the size of their families and how much they earn ; about 87 per cent of enrolees so far this fall qualified for at least some taxpayer - funded payout at 138 per cent of the poverty level , @entity7 become eligible for @entity151 and pay nothing for their care			1
the poverty limit for a family of four in 2014 was $ 23,850 , and will increase in 2015 with inflation			0
that means a two - parent household with two children can get government help for @entity1 this year unless its earnings top $ 95,400			1
income below $ 32,913 makes the family eligible for @entity151 coverage			0
according to a @entity167 online calculator , the same family could opt for an $ 8,290 ' silver ' level insurance policy and pay about $ 600 for it after subsidies are applied			2
with a $ 50,000 family income , they would only be responsible for $ 3,300 in premium payments for the year .			0

@entity4 said tuesday that about seven out of every eight @entity1 enrollees will get government help paying for their medical insurance policies
that number was 80 per cent a year ago
people on @entity1 can get subsidies if their households earn less than four times the federal government 's official ' poverty ' level
sixty - four per cent of @entity7 have small enough incomes to qualify , meaning that @entity1 customers are *disproportionately* poor
entire $ 65 billion subsidy system could become *illegal* next year , depending on how the @entity19 rules in a *landmark* case
