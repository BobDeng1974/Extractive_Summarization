by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:38 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 5 august 2013 when first - time mother @entity3 found out she was expecting a girl , she was determined that her daughter would want for nothing			1
in her excitement , the 25 - year - old managed to spend £ 3,000 on clothes , toys and nursery furniture , all in the most girlish shade of pink			2
@entity14 was , when the big day finally came , the ' little princess ' they were expecting turned out to be a little boy			0
pretty in pink : @entity3 and her husband @entity19 were told by doctors they were expecting a baby girl so spent £ 3,000 on pretty baby essentials ... but then she gave birth to a little boy and is now stuck with a wardrobe full of pink clothes is that you , @entity30 : when baby @entity32 was born he was quite a surprise , not only because he was a little bit early , but also because he was a boy ... and his parents thought he was going to be a girl so now @entity3 , who lives in @entity36 , @entity37 , with husband @entity19 , 37 , who had already eagerly decorated the pink nursery with stencils of their supposed daughter 's chosen name , @entity42 - are adapting all their preparations to make them more suitable for their new son , @entity32			1
@entity3 said : ' i could n't understand it when the midwife said it was a boy			1
all our scans had confirmed it was a girl and i had everything prepared in pink			0
' we had picked her name , @entity42 , and had the room decorated with her name stencilled across the pink feature wall			2
we even had personalised blankets as gifts from family and friends			0
' when @entity3 found out she was pregnant , she and @entity19 decided they wished to know the baby 's sex so they could be fully prepared for everything to come			1
discovering it was a girl meant the forward - thinking couple could purchase all they needed for their ' little princess '			0
a room fit for a little princess : the nursery was designed for @entity42 , and even had her name stencilled on the walls , but it has now been decorated with @entity82 to make it more suitable for @entity32 every girl 's dream wardrobe : @entity86 already had a closet full of pretty dresses and fluffy booties before she was born ... but then little @entity32 came along instead mother - to - be : the eager couple spent £ 3.000 on their unborn daughter , and were even give a personalised blanket embroidered with her name , @entity30 friends and family bought lots of pink clothes and accessories as gifts , and their own spending began to mount up too			1
but @entity3 always knew having a baby was n't going to be cheap , so the couple were happy to spend the money			1
she said : ' it was my first baby and so we had to buy all the essentials			0
' i wanted everything to be perfect for her so that she would want for nothing			0
being prepared was my main concern , and seeing as i knew i was having a girl i did n't see the harm in buying everything in pink			2
' little princess ? luckily the couple bought most of the clothes in @entity121 , who let them take them back and exchange little dresses for dungarees and blue t - shirts for baby @entity32 @entity3 said : ' the midwife said to @entity19 that there was something we needed to see			1
i instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong			0
she then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son ' @entity32 's new room : the couple 's baby now has a @entity82 - themed room and when @entity3 went into labour four weeks early , she knew everything was ready for their new arrival			1
but when the midwife went to hand the newborn to her she could n’t believe what she was hearing			0
@entity3 said : ' the midwife said to @entity19 that there was something we needed to see			1
' i instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong			0
she then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son			0
' we looked at each other and could n't believe that @entity30 was actually a boy			0
' we decided to name him @entity32 as we did n't think he would appreciate the name @entity30			2
' @entity3 and @entity19 then had to start the mammoth task of trying to get back the staggering £ 3,000 they had spent so that they could get @entity32 everything he would need			1
so prepared : the couple were very pleased with themselves for preparing so well for the birth of their daughter do you know who i am : doctors told @entity3 that she was definitely expecting a girl when they gave her her 20 - week scan @entity19 said : ' there was so much to change and friends and family have been so helpful			1
' we had bought most of the clothes from @entity121 and they were fantastic and let us exchange everything			0
' but we still have a lot of pink things that we ca n't return and so we ’re just keeping them and hoping , at some stage , we have a girl			2
' the nursery is now redecorated with a @entity82 theme , so we think @entity32 will prefer that to a pink room			2
' i 'm sure it 's a girl : doctors were wrong about the sex of the couple 's baby ... as he turned out to be a boy baby love : @entity3 and @entity19 were surprised to meet baby @entity32 , but thrilled nonetheless			1

@entity3 , 25 , and husband @entity19 , 37 , were told they were having a girl
the couple from @entity37 discovered baby was a boy after birth
they were going to call her @entity42 , but named him @entity32 instead
have tried to swap pink items for blue ones , but could n't swap everything
