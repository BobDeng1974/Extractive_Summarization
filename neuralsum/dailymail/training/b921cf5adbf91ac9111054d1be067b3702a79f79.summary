by @entity1 reporter published : 14:12 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 22 december 2012 president @entity2 has scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with @entity5			1
instead , he 's calling for a limited measure sufficient to prevent the government from careening off the ' fiscal cliff ' in january by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set of agency budget cuts			1
in a @entity14 appearance friday , @entity2 also called on @entity15 to extend jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off for 2 million people at the end of the year			1
@entity20 president @entity2 delivers a statement on the fiscal cliff at the @entity23 of the @entity14 thursday @entity2 's announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement before year 's end have probably collapsed			1
it also suggested that any chance for a smaller deal may rest in the @entity31 , particularly after the collapse of a plan by @entity14 speaker @entity34 , @entity35 , to permit tax rates to rise on million - dollar - plus incomes			1
' in the next few days , i 've asked leaders of @entity15 to work toward a package that prevents a tax hike on middle - class @entity20 , protects unemployment insurance for 2 million @entity20 , and lays the groundwork for further work on both growth and deficit reduction , ' @entity2 said			2
' that 's an achievable goal			2
that can get done in 10 days			0
' maybe , maybe not			0
the latest plan faces uncertainty at best in the sharply divided @entity31			0
@entity5 leader @entity52 of @entity53 , who wields great power even in the minority , called friday for @entity31 action on a @entity14 bill from the summer extending the full menu of bush - era tax cuts			1
he promised that it will take @entity5 votes for anything to clear the @entity31 , where 60 votes are required to advance most legislation			0
@entity34 , giving the @entity5 weekly radio address , said , ' of course , hope springs eternal , and i know we have it in us to come together and do the right thing			1
' the president called on congressional leaders to work out a solution on the fiscal cliff over the @entity78 break			2
he also said ' because we did n't get this done , i will see you next week			0
' earlier , @entity34 said @entity2 needs to give more ground to reach an agreement and that both he and @entity2 had indicated in a monday telephone call that their latest offers represented their bottom lines			1
' how we get there , ' he added , ' @entity90 only knows			0
' @entity15 shut down for @entity78 and @entity2 flew to @entity91 with his family for the holidays			0
but both men indicated they 'd be back in @entity95 , working to beat the fast - approaching jan. 1 deadline with an agreement between @entity78 and @entity98 's			1
@entity2 announced his plans after talking by phone with @entity34 and meeting with senate majority leader @entity101 , @entity102 , who had previously pinned his hopes on an @entity2 - @entity34 agreement and is wary of dealing with @entity105			1
president @entity2 speaks to reporters about the fiscal cliff in the @entity108 at the @entity14 in @entity95 at the @entity14 , @entity2 projected optimism despite of weeks of failed negotiations			2
' call me a hopeless optimist , but i actually still think we can get it done , ' he said			0
@entity34 spoke in the morning , describing the increasingly tangled attempts to beat the jan. 1 deadline and head off the perilous combination of across - the - board tax hikes and deep spending cuts			1
' because of the political divide in the country , because of the divide here in @entity95 , trying to bridge these differences has been difficult , ' @entity34 said			2
' if it were easy , i guarantee you this would have been done decades before			0
' @entity2 said that in his negotiations with @entity34 , he had offered to meet republicans halfway when it came to taxes and ' more than halfway ' toward their target for spending cuts			1
it 's clear , however , that there 's great resistance in @entity5 ranks to forging a bargain with @entity2 along the lines of a possible agreement that almost seemed at hand just a few days ago : tax hikes at or just over $ 1 trillion over 10 years , matched by comparable cuts to federal health care programs , @entity145 benefits and across federal agency operating budgets			1
@entity148 skies cover the @entity149 in @entity95 as @entity15 closes down for the holiday without a compromise on the ' fiscal cliff ' @entity2 said he remains committed to working toward a goal of longer - term deficit reduction to reduce chronic trillion - dollar deficits while keeping tax rates in place for nearly everyone			2
' even though @entity65 and @entity5 are arguing about whether those rates should go up for the wealthiest individuals , all of us - every single one of us - agrees that tax rates should n't go up for the other 98 percent of @entity20 , ' @entity2 said , citing statistics associated with his promise to protect household income under $ 250,000 from higher tax rates			0
neither the @entity14 nor the @entity31 is expected to meet again until after @entity78			0
officials in both parties said there was still time to prevent the changes from kicking in with the new year			0
the week began amid optimism that @entity2 and @entity34 had finally begun to significantly narrow their differences			2
both were offering a cut in taxes for most @entity20 , an increase for a relative few , and cuts of roughly $ 1 trillion in spending over a year			2
also included was a provision to scale back future cost - of - living increases for @entity145 recipients - a concession by the president that inflamed many liberals			0
. @entity5 officials said some senior republicans such as rep. @entity187 , @entity188 , the most recent @entity5 vice presidential nominee , opposed the possible agreement			0
but no. 2 house republican @entity190 of @entity191 has joined arms with @entity34			1
@entity34 stepped back and announced what he called @entity194 , legislation to let tax rates rise on incomes of $ 1 million or more while preventing increases for all other taxpayers			1
speaker of the house @entity34 , ( left ) and senate majority leader @entity101 ( right with the president ) must compromise together along with president @entity2 on the looming ' fiscal cliff ' despite statements of confidence , he and his lieutenants decided late thursday they were not going to be able to secure the votes needed to pass the measure in the face of opposition from conservatives unwilling to violate decades - old party orthodoxy never to raise tax rates			1
the retreat came after it became clear that too many @entity5 feared ' the perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes , ' @entity34 said			2
@entity34 also said that last monday he had told @entity2 he had submitted his bottom - line proposal			1
' the president told me that his numbers - the $ 1.3 trillion in new revenues , $ 850 billion in spending cuts - was his bottom line , that he could n't go any further			1
' that contradicted remarks by @entity14 press secretary @entity227 , who said on thursday that @entity2 has ' never said either in private or in public that this was his final offer			0
he understands that to reach a deal it would require some further negotiation			0
there is not much further he could go			0
he understands that to reach a deal it would require			0
