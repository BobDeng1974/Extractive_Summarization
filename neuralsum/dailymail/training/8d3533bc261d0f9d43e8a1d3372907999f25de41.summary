the personal aide of one - time @entity2 presidential nominee @entity1 blasted @entity4 's former top adviser on wednesday for saying @entity1 once claimed the president 's win in 2012 was the product of an aggressive get - out - the - vote operation tageting blacks			1
@entity11 said political strategist @entity12 told a ' ridiculous ... lie ' about a phone call between the two politicians on @entity16			1
@entity1 , according to a new memoir by @entity12 , ticked off @entity4 on one of the most important nights of his life when he called to concede the race , saying , ' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like @entity26 and @entity27			1
' that 's how @entity4 remembers it , according to @entity12 , who writes that the president concluded : ' in other words , black people			1
that 's what he ( @entity1 ) thinks this was all about			2
' @entity36 told @entity37 on wednesday that he was in the room listening to @entity1 's end of the conversation , and it never happened			2
... there are a lot of tough issues facing the country ... and i hope you tackle those tough issues			0
' ' i 'm happy to help in any way , ' the aide recalled @entity1 as saying on the phone			0
' @entity80 and i will pray for you daily ; you have a tough job ahead			0
' @entity12 , a longtime @entity4 campaign insider , made the claim that @entity1 linked his loss to the race of @entity4 's political base in a book due for a feb. 10 release @entity4 was ' unsmiling during the call , and slightly irritated when it was over , ' he wrote			1
@entity11 said neither man was on a speakerphone – something photos of the historic moment on both ends of the call confirms			0
so no one in @entity4 's @entity99 hotel room , other than the president himself , could know what @entity1 said			1
the call was brief , @entity11 said wednesday , and included no specifics about turnout in any area of the country – something he said ' i know for a fact			0
' @entity1 's personal assistant @entity11 ( right ) saw and heard everything the @entity2 candidate said and did during the last presidential race , and he suggests @entity12 is lying to make the @entity2 look like a race - obsessed sore loser ' i just hope this lie is the work of @entity12 and not the president , ' he told @entity37			1
i was very disappointed they would make that up			0
' the revelation appeared timed for release when @entity1 would be teeing up his third attempt to win the @entity127			0
he announced on jan. 30 , however , that he wo n't be running			0
@entity12 – ' axe ' to @entity130 power players – may have been playing to the political world 's baser instincts by linking @entity1 to a race - based attack when he was expected to be building support for the 2016 election			1
if his account is accurate , though , it shows how frustrated the former @entity44 governor was after late polling showed he had a reasonable chance to win			0
@entity12 also writes that @entity1 was genuinely surprised he had failed to pull it off			2
the @entity143 got an advance copy of @entity12 's memoir , ' believer : my 40 years in @entity148			2
' now the founding director of the @entity150 at the @entity151 , @entity12 cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the @entity156			0
three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting @entity160 senator @entity159			2
@entity12 later managed the re-election campaign of @entity162 , @entity99 's first black mayor , he later worked for then - senator @entity164 ' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to @entity4 's 2008 effort			1
@entity11 ( right ) shadowed @entity1 everywhere during the 2012 presdiential campaign , and says he heard what the @entity2 said when he called to concede the race to @entity4 justice clinton ? the president briefly considered appointing @entity171 to the @entity172 after he clobbered her in the 2008 @entity130 primary ultimately he became one of the president 's most senior advisers before departing the @entity127 in 2011			1
his career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in @entity180 and @entity181			0
this year he 's consulting with @entity183 's @entity182 in advance of may 7 elections			1
@entity182 has said @entity12 is being paid a ' six - figure salary ' for his advice , and that he is working with @entity188 , @entity182 ’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls			2
other tidbits from his book include the claim that @entity4 briefly mulled putting @entity171 on the @entity160 @entity172 as a consolation prize after he trounced her in the @entity130 primary			1
close @entity4 adviser @entity195 , @entity12 writes , made @entity4 's first chief of staff @entity196 so uncomfortable that he tried to shunt her out of the @entity127 by enticing her to run for @entity4 's vacated @entity199 seat			2
' i do n't want to manage the president 's best friend , ' @entity196 said in @entity12 's retelling			2
ultimately , @entity4 scotched the idea and kept @entity205 in his @entity127 inner circle			0
conservatives consider her the president 's sinister , @entity210 - like policy whisperer , even casting her in the role of the president 's final arbiter on key issues			0
@entity1 has decided not to run again in 2016 , disappointing liberals who yearned to hammer him on income - inequality issues ( again ) @entity217 ? @entity4 joked that he would vacate the @entity127 and let @entity219 's then - senator @entity218 live there if she would only vote for @entity220 and @entity12 writes that during the legislative battle over the @entity220 – obamacare – @entity4 was so convinced he needed a few @entity2 senators on hs side that he joked about letting one of them , @entity219 's then - senator @entity223 , live in the @entity127			1
' we 'll call it the @entity218 plan			0
hell , she can live here in the @entity127 ! @entity233 and i will get an apartment , ' @entity4 's adviser recalls him saying			0
@entity12 also tells readers that the president got a sneak preview of the original @entity239 from the late @entity241 ceo @entity240 , that he rejected the idea of being anyone 's vice president , and that @entity4 – not @entity245 – was president @entity247 's first choice to be his communications director during his initial presidential run in 1992 .			1

@entity12 wrote that losing @entity2 sniped during his *concession* call that the president ' did a great job of getting the vote out in places like @entity26 and @entity27 '
the @entity4 campaign strategist claims @entity4 was annoyed by the *insinuation* but a @entity1 aide says his account is ' ridiculous ' and a ' lie '
@entity12 memoir also claims president considered putting @entity171 on the @entity172 , but said he would never accept a vice presidential post
and @entity4 , he writes – not @entity245 – was @entity247 's first choice to be his communications director during his 1992 campaign
@entity12 has a long career in @entity130 politics and is consulting with @entity183 's @entity182 during this year 's elections
