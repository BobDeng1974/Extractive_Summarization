from the mysteries of how life starts to the intricacies of how animals things , microscopic photography has opened up a whole new world for researchers			1
today , the best images of the year were honoured in the 2014 @entity8			1
first prize went to an extraordinary movie of a fruit fly developing from a trembling bars of cells			1
@entity36 appendages that sweep plankton and other food into the barnacle 's shell for consumption			1
confocal microscopy , 100x from algae to zebrafish , life under the microscope can be beautiful , surprising and mysterious			2
this week , amazing glimpses of the unseen universe earned top prizes in the 2014 @entity50 , the world 's foremost forum for showcasing microscope images of life science subjects			1
@entity15 went to an extraordinary movie of a fruit fly developing , captured by a team including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 of the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity59			1
in the fascinating video , a trembling ball of cells turns into a fully developed fly larva that actually starts to crawl off screen by the movie 's end			1
it was selected from among nearly 2500 entries to earn $ 5,000 worth of @entity8 equipment			1
' for 11 years , @entity8 has sponsored this competition to shed light on the importance of research and draw attention to the amazing intersection of science and art , ' said @entity78 , chairman of @entity79 , part of @entity81			1
' @entity8 movies and images have spurred public interest in and support of microscopy , drawn attention to the vital work that goes on in laboratories worldwide , and inspired young people to seek careers in science			1
' the @entity15 movie is a good example , say organisers of the contest			1
high - speed videos like this allow researchers , almost for the first time , to follow the fate of individual embryonic cells from shortly after fertilization to the time the fly larva hatches ; the cells divide , migrate , diversify and eventually become the varied organs and systems of the fly			1
understanding exactly how an animal develops and how different cells develop separate functions can lead to a better understanding of life processes , and ultimately may contribute to disease research			1
@entity114 weevils up close , captured using @entity116 microscopy rat brain cerebral cortex ( left ) depicting cell nuclei ( cyan ) , astrocytes ( @entity122 , yellow ) , and blood vessels ( @entity125 , red )			2
taken by @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128			2
on the right , @entity131 polychaete worm larva from a plankton samplecollected in @entity133 off the south coast of the @entity136 specimen size approx 2mm , and it weas taken by @entity137 , @entity138 a butter daisy ( @entity140 ) flower at 2xmagnification			2
@entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145			2
the movie , captured using a custom - built simultaneous multi-view light sheet microscope , includes more than two million images in the complete data set ; its true potential is extracted by using complex mathematical models to learn the fate of every cell			1
@entity25 was a brilliant photo of a rat cerebellum , part of the brain , captured by @entity30 of the @entity31 's @entity158			2
the image , captured using multiphoton imaging , was captured at 300x			2
other images offer additional eye - opening glimpses of life on a microscopic scale as captured by scientists , hobbyists and students			2
@entity169 , another researcher at @entity170 , earned @entity171 for his colorful confocal image of the parts of a barnacle that sweep food into the barnacle 's shell for consumption			0
fourth prize was an amusing image of two weevils staged and captured by @entity126 of @entity182 , @entity128			0
3 4 one of the most interesting images this year was the @entity185 image of the gears of a green coneheaded planthopper ( @entity189 ) nymph			0
the insects are accomplished jumpers , able to accelerate at staggering 500 times the force of gravity			0
to synchronize the movement of their hind legs , their trochanters are coupled with a pair of cogs			0
images such as this one help demonstrate that gears , which until recently were thought to be a human invention , exist in the natural world			0
the confocal image was captured by @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity24 , in @entity59			0
@entity207 ( mouthparts ) of a vampire moth ( @entity209 )			0
@entity210 was captured by @entity211 in @entity212			0
the probosciswas imaged at 10x and shows the dorsal legulae , tearing hooks , and erectile barbs that facilitate the acquisition of fruit juices andmammalian blood when feeding			1
@entity221 and @entity222 , @entity223 @entity224 coneheaded planthopper ( @entity225 ) nymph with its gears			0
the insects are accomplished jumpers , able toaccelerate at staggering 500 times the force of gravity ( 500xg ) ; tosynchronize the movement of their hind legs , their trochantersare coupled with a pair of cogs			0
image shows dorsal view ofthese trochanteral gears			0
the insect demonstrates that gears , which until recently were thought to be a human invention , existin the natural world			0
confocal microscopy , magnification ca.200x			0
it was taken by @entity169 at the @entity170 in @entity24 , @entity59			0
@entity248 this year went to a fascinating video of the neural activity in an entire living zebrafish brain captured by @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity252 of @entity170 , @entity24 , @entity59 the video shows fast 3d recordings of the entire larval brain ( about 100,000 neurons ) and depicts , for the first time , an almost exhaustive view of single - neuron activity in the brain of a vertebrate .			0
