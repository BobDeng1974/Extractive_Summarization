a man who paid out around £ 30,000 to the @entity1 for a child he has proved is not his will not get his money back despite a promise that he would			1
the @entity1 wrote to him twice saying that if he could prove he was not the father of the girl then he would get a full refund			1
but now the 49 - year - old has been told that even though he has provided a dna test showing that he is not the father , he will not get a penny back			2
a @entity19 ( @entity19 ) spokesman said today : “ if a person continues to make child support payments for year after year , the assumption has to be that they accept parentage			0
“ when there is a dispute , then the onus is very much on the father to prompt action and have a paternity test , rather than pay and wait until the child is an adult			0
“ reimbursements can only be considered after a paternity test is taken			0
” a @entity19 source said a rebate would not be considered if the paternity test is taken after the child has become an adult and the case is closed			0
a dna swab is taken : a private dna test which took place in february 2014 and confirmed that @entity13 was not the father mr @entity13 ’s lawyer @entity45 said : “ i will continue to represent my client and take his complaint to the next stage			1
” @entity49 said payments of £ 86.31p per week were deducted from his salary from june 2007 up until april 2014 when she got the payments stopped - a total of around £ 31,000			1
she added that there was a level of miscommunication between 2003 and 2013 between her client and the @entity1 because he does not understand letters he receives due to his dyslexia , which he told the @entity1 about			1
she said : “ he has disputed parentage from the outset from 2003			2
he requested a dna test by letter in april 2007			2
“ we got involved in july 2013 and asked for a breakdown but we did not get one			2
” @entity49 said her firm located the ‘ child ’ - now a young woman - and arranged a private dna test which took place in february 2014 and confirmed that @entity13 was not the father			1
the lawyer wrote three letters to the @entity1 asking for a refund as well as a breakdown of how much he had paid but ‘ these letters were ignored ’			1
mr @entity13 , from @entity77 , @entity14 , who runs a security company , suffers with dyslexia and because of this ‘ would not a clue ’ about the @entity1 procedures			1
he said : “ the @entity1 say they set up two dna tests but that is an absolute lie			2
and they knew i was dyslexic			0
i told them to speak to me on the phone , do n’t send me letters			2
but i did keep all the paperwork which i gave to my solicitor			0
” and one @entity1 letter dated august 2013 from a general manager states : “ as mr @entity13 failed to attend the @entity88 the child support agency arranged for him , he will have to pay for a private dna test			1
“ if this shows that he is not the parent of the child then he will be refunded back any money he has made			0
” and a second letter written to his then mp , @entity104 @entity103 , in september 2007 , written by a complaints resolution officer , said : “ until the @entity1 receives a declaration of parentage confirming mr @entity13 is not the father of the qualifying child , we will continue to request payments by deductions of earning order and maintain the case until such time as the case closes			1
“ should mr @entity13 obtain a declaration of parentage showing he is not the father , any payments he has made will be refunded to him in full			1
” but in june 2014 his lawyer received another letter from the @entity1 which read : “ as his dna test proves he is not the father , a refund could be considered , but only for payments made against any charges for maintenance due from march 2014 , when his test was taken , onwards			1
“ however as his case was closed from september 2009 ( when the girl ended full time education ) there are no ongoing maintenance charges against which payments were made and a refund is therefore not possible			2
“ whilst i appreciate that mr @entity13 will be disappointed , i trust i have explained the reason for our decision clearly			1
” the letter also admitted that the @entity1 continued to take money from mr @entity13 ’s salary after 2009 ‘ in order to recover the outstanding balance of arrears ’			1
the @entity1 admitted that since 2003 mr @entity13 disputed he was the father of the girl - but he did not have the dna test until 2014			1
he said : “ i had a one - night stand with the mother of this girl , on two occasions			1
she was with a boyfriend at the time			2
“ she obviously looked at me like a cash cow			0
it was a fling 23 years ago and the girl is now 22 - years - old			2
“ i work in a nightclub and the @entity1 contacted my employers and took my money			2
they accepted her word with no proof at all			0
“ i always said she was not my child			0
it was basically a one night stand but i wore protection which i know is not 100 % but from day one i knew she was not my child			1
“ now the government seem to be penny pinching off me			0
i work all the hours i can every day and have not had a holiday in nine years			0
” mr @entity13 , who has two grown up children who he has paid maintenance for , said he was shelling out £ 70 a week from his wages for the girl since 1995 - £ 35 a week plus another £ 35 a week in back pay			1

it can also tell who is not the father as was the case in mr @entity13 's case he said over the years he has made hundreds of phone calls to the @entity1 who told him to prove he was not the father			1
he said : “ i could not afford a solicitor			0
but when i was told i had to pay another £ 8,000 back pay i got one because i had been hitting brick walls			0
“ they have said in black and white that if i can prove i am not the father they will refund all the money			0
“ i have had to borrow £ 20,000 from my father to keep going			0
over the years the @entity1 has taken all my money			2
but i am not giving up on this			0
i do n’t care what it costs			0
“ i do n’t know if the girl knows who her real dad is			0
i feel sorry for her but i have had no contact with her mother			0
“ but whoever her biological father is has got away with it and not paid a penny			0
