@entity1 senators @entity0 and @entity3 's row over the resuscitation of relations with @entity6 has continued to escalate , with the @entity8 lawmaker now calling @entity0 the ' chief cheerleader of @entity11 's foreign policy ' and the @entity13 legislator accusing his colleague of funding the @entity15			1
@entity0 's latest attack on @entity3 , a possible opponent in the @entity1 's 2016 presidential primary , relates to ongoing monetary aid to @entity19 , where the @entity15 once held sway over the government but was banned from participating in politics earlier this year due to its terrorist ties			1
in a tweet trolling @entity3 , the libertarian lawmaker said he ' forgot to mention his support for @entity11 's funding of @entity28			1
@entity15 , arming @entity30 rebels , and @entity32 's war in @entity33			0
' @entity13 sen. @entity0 and @entity8 sen. @entity3 are feuding over president @entity11 's announcement last week that the @entity35 had resumed high - level diplomatic relations with @entity6			1
the two potential 2016 rivals have been taking public digs at each other for days now - but they swear its not related to the presidential election after @entity3 called @entity0 the ' chief cheerleader of @entity11 's foreign policy , ' the @entity41 directed this tweet at him , accusing him of indirectly funding the @entity15 by supporting ongoing aid to @entity19 freshman sen. @entity0 notably opposed legislation this fall to train and equip moderate @entity48 rebels to fight @entity49 in a ground war			1
the war - weary lawmaker was also a vocal opponent of the @entity11 administration 's use of airstrikes - without the approval of @entity57 - during a 2011 military intervention in @entity33			2
@entity3 voted in favor of a resolution backed by the @entity11 administration to fund the @entity48 opposition movement and urged @entity57 in 2011 to give @entity11 the authority to bomb former @entity33 dictator @entity64 and his regime			2
@entity0 's hard - hitting tweet to @entity3 was the latest jab thrown in a feud between the frenemies that began last week after president @entity11 suddenly announced that the @entity35 and @entity6 were back on speaking terms after a 53 - year embargo on the country			1
the @entity13 senator said that lifting the unilateral embargo was ' probably a good idea ' because it ' does n’t seem to be working			0
' ' probably , it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship , ' he contended			0
@entity3 , whose parents immigrated from communist @entity6 , then asserted that @entity0 ' has no idea what he ’s talking about			1
' since the president made public his administration 's secret talks with @entity6 , which took place throughout the fall , @entity3 has become the face of the @entity1 opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president , @entity97			1
' i would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that , they would realize that the embargo is not what 's hurting the @entity6 people , ' he said last week on @entity105 in response to @entity0 's support for the move			2
' it 's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders			0
' in the pages of the @entity114 , @entity3 called the declaration ' a victory for oppressive governments the world over ' and a policy shift that is based on a ' lie			1
' ' @entity6 already enjoys access to commerce , money and goods from other nations , and yet the @entity6 people are still not free , ' he argued			0
' they are not free because the regime — just as it does with every aspect of life — manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island			0
more economic engagement with the @entity35 means that the regime ’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come — dashing the @entity6 people ’s hopes for freedom and democracy			0
' smackdown : @entity0 trolled @entity3 with the above tweet in response to his claim that his colleague ' has no idea what he ’s talking about ' when it comes to @entity6 laying out his own views on the issue in @entity150 , @entity0 made clear on friday in an op - ed that his family ' despised , not only communism , but collectivism , socialism and any “ ism ” that deprived the individual of his or her natural rights			1
' ' i ran for office to fight for the individual and against statism of any kind anywhere and yet … i think a policy of isolationism toward @entity6 is misplaced and has n’t worked , ' he said			2
@entity0 explained that he supports engagement with ' many countries with less than stellar human rights records , because i believe that once enslaved people taste freedom and see the products of capitalism they will become hungry for freedom themselves			0
' furthermore , ' it is an inconsistent and incoherent position to support trade with other communist countries , but not communist @entity6 , ' he wrote , pointing out that the @entity35 does not prohibit trade with @entity180 nor has it cut off relations with @entity182 over the past 70 years			2
' let ’s hope cooler heads will ultimately prevail and we unleash a trade tsunami that washes the @entity187 once and for all into the sea , ' he concluded			0
but in a tweet that afternoon @entity0 accused @entity3 of ' acting like an isolationist who wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moat			2
' ' i reject this isolationism , ' he added			0
and in a tv appearance that evening @entity0 again ripped into @entity3 and derided his retaliatory comments as ' a little bit rude and intemperate			1
' defending himself , @entity0 told @entity201 host @entity200 that he 's not responsible for beginning the dispute , however			2
@entity3 is to blame for that , he said			0
' i never start a fight , but i 'm happy to finish a fight , ' he stated			1
@entity0 also denied that the squabble was related to either man 's political aspirations			0
' i think it 's about the issues , i do n't think that there 's any certainty that either one of us will run at this point , ' he said			0
he added , ' it 's also about a fellow @entity1 who chose to , i think , use rude and inappropriate language with regard to a fellow @entity1 , and i think that ... i wo n't stand for it , frankly			0
' and if someone 's gon na cast aspersions on me , and not talk about policy , then there will be an altercation			0
and i wo n't shy away from a battle , and i think that i 've shown that			0
' @entity3 , whose parents immigrated from communist @entity6 , has become the face of the @entity1 opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president , @entity97			1
he is pictured here last wednesday at a press conference in @entity236 , where he spoke out against the policy shift not one to walk away from a fight himself , @entity3 said sunday that if @entity0 ' wants to become the chief cheerleader of @entity11 's foreign policy , he certainly has a right to do that			1
' i 'm going to continue to oppose the ... @entity11 - @entity0 foreign policy on @entity6 because i know it wo n't lead to freedom and liberty for the @entity6 people , which is my sole interest here , ' he argued			1
he later stated , in response to a question about former @entity8 gov. @entity252 's candidacy for president , that his own decision in 2016 wo n't be based on ' anyone else who would decide to run			2
' ' if someone makes the decision that the best place for them to serve their country , the best place for them to achieve , in my case , an agenda to restore the @entity35 dream , if i make the decision that the best place for me to do that is the presidency , then i 'm going to run for president , ' he said			0
the @entity8 senator followed up his remarks with , ' i have n't made that decision yet			0
' a staffer for @entity0 responded to @entity3 's attacks on his boss by bringing attention to @entity3 's views on arming @entity48 rebels , striking @entity33 and giving aid to @entity19			1
' with all due respect , senator @entity3 was captain of the @entity1 cheerleading team for @entity11 ’s arming of @entity48 rebels , bombing @entity33 resulting in a jihadist wonderland , and illegally giving foreign aid to @entity19 ’s military government , ' @entity0 aide @entity281 said in a statement			2
' the @entity290 foreign policy has made the @entity291 and @entity292 less safe , ' he said , echoing @entity0 's comments on twitter .			1

feud began after @entity3 hit @entity0 for supporting president @entity11 's decision to resume diplomatic relations with @entity6
@entity3 believes that lifting the 53 - year - old embargo on the communist country is ' a victory for oppressive governments the world over '
*yesterday* he called @entity0 the ' chief cheerleader of @entity11 's foreign policy ' and labeled the @entity6 shift the ' @entity309 foreign policy '
@entity0 insists dispute is not about 2016 , it 's about @entity3 's ' rude and intemperate ' comments ; ' i never start a fight , but i 'm happy to finish a fight '
