education secretary @entity10 has scrapped regulations which dictate how much space schools should provide for their pupils for team games			1
new rules state merely that ‘ suitable ’ outdoor space must be provided for sport and play			1
thing of the past ? schools will no longer be required to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the @entity9 the move calls into question the @entity28 ’s strategy on school sport and building a lasting @entity9 legacy which boosts competitive games			1
critics warned that more playing fields could now be sold off , undermining the @entity28 ’s commitment to strengthening competitive sport			1
@entity36 recently pledged to put sports such as netball , tennis and football on the national curriculum for primary school children and said the ethos of schools must change so pupils learn that ‘ winning and losing is an important part of growing up ’			2
the new rules on school playing fields were drawn up on july 19 , laid before @entity50 on july 30 and come into force in october			2
under current regulations , dating from 1999 , schools are expected to follow detailed rules on outdoor space laid down in a table which is enshrined in law			1
primary schools with fewer than 200 pupils , for example , should set aside 30 square yards or 25 square metres of ‘ game playing field ’ for every child			2
up and running : @entity65 chariman @entity63 and prime minister @entity36 have praised the success of the @entity9 and pledge to build a lasting legacy which boosts competitive sport larger primaries must set aside 50 square yards , or 42 square metres			1
secondary schools must set aside up to 60 square yards , or 50 square metres , depending on its size			2
but a recent @entity74 consultation found many state schools were struggling to meet the requirements and suggested they be modified			0
school sport has proved a tricky issue for the @entity28 during the @entity9 after it emerged that it has scrapped a target for schools to provide two hours of @entity81 a week			1
it also emerged that mr @entity10 has sanctioned the disposal of 22 playing fields , although most were at schools that had closed or were merging			0
the @entity86 said it would soon consult on a new minimum requirement for playing field space , which would be simpler than the current ‘ bureaucratic ’ table of ratios			0
this would be non-binding guidance			0
contradictions : despite a pledge by mr @entity36 to put team sports on the national curriculum , education secretary @entity10 ( pictured ) has scrapped regulations which dictate how much playing field space schools need to provide officials insisted the new policy states for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal pe lessons and for outdoor play , rather than simply team sport			1
but @entity108 , of the charity @entity109 , warned that playing fields could be cut back and called for a ‘ firm commitment from the government to prioritise school sport and facilities ’			0
@entity116 , chief executive of the @entity117 , an umbrella organisation for sports bodies , said the old regulations had been a ‘ key tool ’ in preventing playing fields being sold			0
‘ without a minimum requirement , the danger is that short - term expediency could jeopardise the ability of schools to deliver sport for future generations , ’ he said			2
@entity130 education spokesman @entity129 said : ‘ this just shows how out of touch @entity10 is			0
' not satisfied with getting rid of the target of pupils playing two hours of sport a week , he is now weakening the standards @entity130 introduced to protect school playing fields			0
‘ if we are to ensure the @entity9 legacy , the government must ensure that schools provide a decent amount of space for competitive sports and play			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity86 said : ‘ these regulations set out for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal pe lessons and for outdoor play			2
‘ by removing pages and pages of bureaucratic restrictions we will make it easier and cheaper to provide the badly needed extra school places that this country needs so urgently			0
‘ our extremely strict rules on playing fields will stay firmly in place			0
this government has only approved sales if the school has closed , has merged or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place			0
