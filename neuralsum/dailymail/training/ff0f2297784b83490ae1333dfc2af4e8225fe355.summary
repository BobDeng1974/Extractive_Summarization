by @entity1 reporter published : 22:22 est , 20 may 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 21 may 2012 getting married was a savvy business decision as well as a personal milestone for @entity6 founder @entity5 , divorce lawyers claimed today			1
the timing of the wedding , the day after the company 's initial public offering , could be particularly advantageous for @entity5 , who saw his net worth soar to $ 19.1 billion			1
any pre-nuptial agreement signed by the couple , commonplace for the super-rich when they marry , would have forced @entity5 and his new bride @entity16 to agree exactly how to split assets - including his @entity6 stock - if their marriage broke up in future			1
in a marriage without a pre-nup , or if the couple had remained unmarried , she could be entitled to half of his wealth under @entity29 law			2
@entity16 and @entity5 share a modest house in @entity33 , @entity29 , where they were married on saturday			1
the couple met as undergraduates at @entity41 in 2004			0
@entity5 , now 28 , dropped out of college to work on @entity6 , while @entity43 , a pediatrician , stayed to earn her undergraduate degree in 2007			1
@entity43 's work led to @entity6 creating an organ donation page			2
had they continued just to live together without getting married , @entity43 could potentially lay claim to a much larger portion of assets , including a chunk of his $ 20 billion in @entity6 shares , lawyers said			1
@entity53 , a lawyer based in @entity54 , @entity29 , said : ' in @entity29 , people who live together without the benefit of marriage could claim they had an agreement to pool resources and efforts			0
' status update : mr @entity5 announced the news on his own personal @entity6 page he said although they are hard to prove , ' those claims can get really ugly '			1
mr @entity53 cited the case of @entity66 , the founder of the company that makes @entity69 flashlights			0
in 1994 , an @entity71 court awarded $ 84 million to @entity66 's girlfriend @entity72 , who took his name and lived with him for 23 years			2
although an appeals court reversed the award in 1998 , she later negotiated a $ 29 million settlement			2
the same logic - avoiding messy court fights - is part of the reasoning behind a prenuptial agreement			0
' one of the primary reasons that wealthy people enter into prenups is to prevent the type of carnage that can come with divorce , ' said @entity89 , an appellate attorney in @entity90			0
' @entity91 to sort it out in advance			0
' a prenuptial agreement in @entity29 typically states how spouses would divide assets in the event of a divorce			0
the couple usually waives the right to make claims based on community - property laws , which state that any property created after the marriage is essentially community property and should be split evenly after any divorce			0
married : the couple have been together for nine years , but did not reveal their engagement @entity29 is one of a handful of states with community - property laws			2
most states rely on equitable - division rules , which give more flexibility to a judge in dividing assets			0
in @entity43 's case , she could lay claim to a portion of the options and grants in @entity6 stock that vest during the time of their marriage , lawyers said			2
if there were no prenup , or if there were and @entity43 contested it , she could also try to go after stock @entity5 held previously if she could claim it increased in value during the relationship and the increase was due directly to @entity5 's efforts			2
lawyers said that is hard to prove for publicly - traded companies			0
' in an organization of this size , that 's not going to happen , ' @entity53 said			0
but still , in case of such a clash , it would likely help @entity5 that the marriage took place the day after the initial public offering			1
sold : @entity6 founder @entity5 is thought to have bought this $ 7 million mansion in @entity33 , @entity29 as his first ever home ' the value of the company is absolutely known , ' said @entity89			1
' there 's no dispute over it			0
' if the timing of the marriage so close to the ipo was accidental , ' then it was a very nice coincidence , ' said @entity53			0
getting married after @entity5 achieved such a high level of success probably made the couple at least consider a prenuptial agreement			1
' if they had gotten married in college , it probably would n't have occurred to them , ' said @entity172 , an attorney at @entity173 in @entity174			0
lawyers said there was no guarantee the couple signed an agreement , citing divorce cases involving wealthy people such as actor @entity182 and singer @entity183 who skipped prenups			0
but they say it is likely they did			0
' in every single state , a wealthy person is better with a prenup , ' said @entity89			0
' i can not comprehend @entity5 marrying without one			2
' flotation : mr @entity5 opened trading on the @entity193 on friday , the day of @entity6 's ipo @entity195 took to the airwaves in an effort to encourage @entity6 founder @entity5 to insist upon using a pre-nuptial agreement before marrying his longtime girlfriend @entity16			1
the only thing ' @entity195 ' did n't know was that said advice was more timely than he expected			2
the real estate tycoon phoned in an appearance on a @entity206 financial show last tuesday , just four days before ms @entity16 and mr @entity5 tied the knot in a secret ceremony in their @entity33 backyard			1
low - key : the newlyweds got married in their back yard in @entity33 , @entity29 because @entity6 's long - awaited @entity194 was due to take place last friday , mr @entity195 decided to steer the conversation onto mr @entity5 's increased wealth			1
having been divorced twice himself , and going into a very public court battle with wife number 1 over their pre-nup , mr @entity195 could be considered an expert on the problem of shielding riches from ex-wives			1
' so the question is [ that @entity5 ] has this lovely girlfriend - i 'm sure she 's lovely - and they get married , and if for some reason over the next couple years they get divorced , and then she sues him for $ 10billion and she hit the jackpot like no body ! ' he said on @entity234			1
' in @entity235 , she would get a big chunk of what he has			0
' that total continues to grow , and the launch of the @entity194 increased his net worth to $ 19.1billion			0
while host @entity241 made the point that since ms @entity16 has been dating mr @entity5 since the beginning of @entity6 , she could make the case that she would deserve a sizeable amount of her husband 's assets			1
mr @entity195 , who low - balled her deserved earnings , said that he could predict her lawyer 's case if the issue ever went to court			1
he predicted that her hypothetical lawyers would argue ' without her and her brilliant decision making it would 've never come through and it would have never existed , she advised him and she made dinner for him and she 's entitled to $ 10billion			2
' look , i am notoriously cheap with these things so i would say if she made a million dollars that would be very good			0
' financial analysts would likely side with mr @entity195 , as agreeing to a set pre-nup saves much legal hassle in the case of divorce			1
couple : ms @entity16 and mr @entity5 met when they studied at @entity41 and have been together ever since watch the video here			1
