@entity1 morality police attacked a young @entity3 woman dressed in a full burkha and face veil - because they thought her eyes were too exposed			1
the @entity7 said the woman was arrested in @entity8 , in the east of the country , along with two men who tried to protect her			1
the charity also claimed women living in @entity15 who offended the militant group 's strict dress code were being beaten by iron rods , @entity12 reports			1
strict : women living under @entity1 control must abide by rules governing their dress , which is enforced by morality police in each city			1
the @entity7 reports one group beat a woman for showing too much eye women living in @entity1 - controlled territory in @entity3 and @entity30 are made to follow strict rules , which they claim are based on @entity33 law			1
the @entity34 has reported the group demands women wear double - layered veils , loose abayas and gloves			2
they are also made to go everywhere with a male guardian			2
but it is not just women who are made to live within draconian laws			0
last month , @entity1 published a code of conduct - including which horrific punishment went with each crime			0
for example , those who commit adultery will be stoned to death if the adulterer was married and lashed 100 times and exiled if he or she was unmarried			0
those engaged in sodomy ( homosexuality ) will be sentenced to death , along with those who ' spy for the unbelievers '			0
those who steal ' as part of banditry ' will have their right hand and left leg cut off , and the punishment for terrorising people is exile			0
beating : this boy was lashed 60 times for calling @entity1 ' @entity75 ' - a name with negative connotations people can also be punished for more minor infringements - including a boy last week , who was flogged 60 times for using the word ' @entity82 ' - a loose acronym for the @entity1 ( @entity84 ) , used by the enemies of @entity1 and seen as having negative connotations			0
enforcing the lesser rules - like dress code - is a job given to the morality police			1
last year , it was reported @entity91 , 20 , of @entity92 , was a key figure behind the morality police in @entity94 , @entity3 - known as the @entity96 brigade			2
it is thought the women were charged with seeking out people engaging in @entity101 culture in @entity94 .			0

woman attacked and two men arrested in @entity3 , @entity7 reports
the men had *stepped* in after she was accused of showing ' too much eye '
those who break dress code in @entity15 , @entity30 , are being beaten by iron rods
rules demand women keep covered up and always with a male ' guard '
