what will weather reports be like in 2050 ? rather dramatic and unnerving if climate change gets out of hand , researchers have claimed			1
in a series of videos the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) will reveal how the effects of global warming could affect our planet in the future			2
the fictional weather reports describe how droughts , floods and heat waves could cause problems in the next 30 years			1
these are based on what happens if climate change is allowed to continue according to the researchers , if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase , the average temperature of @entity29 ’s atmosphere could rise more than 4 ° @entity32 ) by the end of the 21st century			1
a report released earlier this year came to similar conclusions , that emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases			0
if agricultural emissions are not addressed , nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070			0
this alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible			0
' we have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels , ' said @entity52 , @entity53			0
' broad dietary change can take a long time			0
we should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly			0
' by 2050 , estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions , while only contributing three per cent of human calorie intake			0
cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution			0
to find out what this might mean for people on @entity29 , the @entity5 invited television weather presenters to imagine giving a weather report from the year 2050			1
the result is a dramatic compendium of possible scenarios based on the most up - to - date climate science			2
the news forecasters include people from channels across @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80			0
a ‘ teaser ’ video was released today , while videos from the various networks will gradually be released throughout september at the @entity5 website			2
‘ while climate change is global , the impacts will be local , ’ the video states			2
the project is aimed to support discussions that will be held at the @entity90 2014 on 23 september			1
here @entity90 @entity92 ’s @entity91 will hope to convince world leaders from government , finance , business and civil society to take decisive action against climate change			1
the @entity5 is hoping that a meaningful legal agreement can be made to begin seriously reducing greenhouse gas emissions from next year			0
@entity29 's average temperature could rise by more than 4 ° @entity32 ) by the end of the 21st century , according to the researchers			1
this could lead to more extreme weather around the world such as storms , droughts and flooding			1
the videos are being released ahead of the @entity90 2014 on 23 september			1

the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , headquartered in @entity19 , is releasing videos that predict what weather reports will be like in 2050
these are based on what happens if climate change is allowed to continue
@entity29 's average temperature could rise by more than @entity122 ( *7.2* ° f ) by the end of the 21st century , according to researchers
this could lead to more extreme weather around the world such as storms , droughts and flooding
the videos are being released ahead of the @entity90 2014
