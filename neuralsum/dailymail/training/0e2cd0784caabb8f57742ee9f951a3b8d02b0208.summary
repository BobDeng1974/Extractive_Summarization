experts fear this group , driven on by fiction such as @entity5 , might find themselves picking up sexually transmitted infections when they embark on new partnerships			1
the @entity29 , formerly the @entity30 , said older people are dating with little idea about how things have changed			1
acting chief executive @entity34 said : ‘ early in their relationship older couples should be talking about going for a sexually transmitted infection test … they need to be aware they are equally at risk as young people			1
’ she told @entity40 that older people who have been through divorce ‘ are entering the dating scene with little idea about how things have changed			1
‘ they are likely to know even less about sexual health than young people , who have been the target of services and campaigns , ' she said			2

it warned that limits on contraceptive availability could cost taxpayers £ 110billion ( sub : billion correct ) by 2020 in extra costs on the @entity108 for abortion , maternity and child health , and for education and state benefits for children produced by unwanted pregnancies			0
in 2011 there were 8,000 people aged between 35 and 44 known to have the @entity118 chlamydia - up 9 per cent in five years , but fewer than 4,000 45 to 64 - year - olds , though this is up 13per cent since 2008			0
