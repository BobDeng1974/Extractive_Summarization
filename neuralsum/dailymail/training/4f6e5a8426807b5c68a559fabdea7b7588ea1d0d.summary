by @entity0 ' i 'm wearing a shirt by @entity3 and a pair of @entity6 jeans , ' beams @entity7 , a trader from @entity9 's capital , @entity10			1
' it happens like that sometimes			0
' but mr @entity7 's designer threads did n't come from a boutique			2
instead they arrived in a batch of second - hand clothes sourced from a @entity19 charity shop			1
rather than being donated to the world 's poorest people , as a new @entity23 documentary makes clear , cast - off clothing has become a multimillion pound business - and the poor are paying			1
big business : a trader in @entity29 in the northern town of @entity31 shows off her pile of cast - off clothes the @entity19 spends £ 60bn a year on new clothes and much of what is discarded ends up in high street charity shops			1
clothes that are n't sold to shoppers go to recycling plants and from there , to @entity41			1
although the majority of @entity41 countries import cast - off clothing , @entity9 gets the most with 30,000 tonnes arriving in capital @entity10 each year			1
locally , it 's known as ' oboni wawu ' or ' dead white man clothing			1
' ' @entity47 goes fast because it 's a little bit cheaper for the masses to afford , ' explains @entity7 , who owns one of the biggest wholesale businesses in @entity10			2
' if you have 50 @entity54 ( approximately £ 8 ) , you can go to the market and buy a lot of shirts , ' he explains			2
' if you go to the shop , you buy only one or two shirts			2
people prefer to go to the market and buy the used ones			2
' big business : @entity9 imports 30,000 tonnes of second hand clothes each year , much of which arrives in @entity10 lucrative : wholesalers importing second hand clothes from the @entity19 can make up to £ 25,000 a day much of what they do buy comes from the @entity19			1
' we used to get from @entity71 , ' adds mr @entity7			0
' now we go to @entity72			0
this , ' he says , gesturing at a bale of clothes , ' is from @entity78			2
in terms of second hand clothing , @entity19 stuff is the best			1
many people import it more than the other stuff			2
' according to @entity86 , the owner of a boutique selling upmarket second hand clothes to @entity10 's elite , the reason for buying @entity19 comes down to two things : size and quality			1
' we prefer the smaller sizes , ' he explains			0
' that 's why we prefer the @entity19 over the @entity99 clothes			1
' you can get @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106			0
so many , many , things			0
clothing is graded with buyers like @entity110 taking the best pieces , while second and third grade clothes are sold on - the tattiest ending up in the hands of the very poorest who buy them for as little as 25p			1
but while @entity9 's second hand clothing boom is making some people rich , for indigenous textile producers , it has been nothing short of disastrous			1
@entity120 : the poorest quality cast - offs end up in village markets where @entity9 's least well - off buy them report : the @entity23 's @entity125 met some of the traders making money from selling on charity shop clothes end of the road : second hand clothes trader @entity131 sells clothes to the poorest for as little as 25p ' in 2009 , we were producing two million metres of cloth a month , and over that period , it 's gone down by 75 per cent , ' explains @entity138 , the @entity71 - born overseer at the @entity141 factory near @entity142 , which employs 2000 people			1
' it 's quite an urgent situation and we 're on the brink of saying , we ca n't go on			2
' and it 's not just local textile producers that are suffering			1
' second hand clothing brought in from the @entity19 and @entity99 is cheaper , far cheaper , ' adds @entity149 , a local historian			1
' we were trained , even when i was young , to believe that everything western was civilised			0
our belief and respect for our own things has faded to the point where if we are not very careful , some day somewhere , we will not see our own things any more			0
' these days , everybody is keeping an @entity159 name in addition to his own name			0
and they prefer being called their western name to their own name			0
' that alone should tell you			0
the food that we eat has changed			0
we now eat western food as much as our own food			0
it is killing our culture			0
' not that the traders making a killing off the back of @entity19 charitable donations care			0
' it 's a big and very lucrative business , ' says one			0
' you can make money every day			2
on a good day , you can make , lets say , 100,000 @entity9 cedis ( £ 25,000 )			1
i 'm telling you , this business is very lucrative business			0
' this world : the @entity186 of your clothes , tonight at 9pm on @entity188			0
