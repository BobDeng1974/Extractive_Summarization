by @entity0 they are two of @entity3 ’s most acclaimed comedy writers , between them responsible for @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
but there is one @entity9 sitcom so bizarre , and deemed such a dud , that it has been airbrushed from the cvs of @entity12 and @entity13 – and never screened in the 30 years since it was made			2
the pair wrote a show in which @entity17 was a space alien who had been recalled to @entity20 – then replaced as prime minister by @entity22 from the pop group @entity23 , with his bandmates as the @entity25			1
the show called ' @entity23 ' featuring the band was never commissioned by @entity9 and the pilot show was never broadcast a clip from the show , called simply @entity23 , will be seen for the first time tonight as part of @entity9 ’s 50th birthday celebrations			1
described as a ‘ dummy run which did n’t make it out of the starting blocks ’ , the show was never commissioned as a series			0
jokes in the 1984 episode – in which the seat of power has been transplanted to a room above a cafe – include one musician telling @entity22 : ‘ prime minister , i do n’t want to scare you – but boo ! ’ in another scene @entity22 discovers that he has carried saxophonist @entity49 all the way from @entity51 in @entity52 to @entity53 in his saxophone case			2
an unrepentant @entity49 tells @entity22 , ‘ you ought to be glad i do n’t play the piano ’ , and @entity22 turns directly to the camera and says : ‘ good point ! ’ the clips are included in a documentary called @entity61 : @entity9 ’s @entity62 , which celebrates trial shows ‘ made for little money and usually not for public consumption ’			2
other clips include scenes from @entity69 ’s @entity68 from 2008 , which became the hugely successful @entity69 , and the now forgotten @entity71 , in which @entity70 asked celebrities for their ideal dinner party guests			0
in the pilot , @entity75 tells the @entity78 host ‘ not to try any of your fascist prostitute stuff ’			0
another of the shows which had never been broadcast featured @entity83 the documentary also includes a recently discovered performance from @entity83 in his 1966 series on the margin			0
the playwright , who turned 80 on friday , plays a businessman who signs off a telegram to his wife with ‘ @entity92 ’ , which he explains is code for ‘ @entity94 off , ready when i come home ’			0
until the clip was found , it had been assumed the entire series of on the margin had been wiped by the @entity9			0
tonight ’s documentary , which airs at 9pm , also includes footage of @entity103 and @entity104 in their stage show behind @entity106 , which has not been shown on @entity3 tv for 45 years , and the pilot episode of @entity109 from 2002			1
