new parents @entity0 and @entity2 say all they want is a screaming child and long , sleepless nights			0
instead , their six - week old baby , @entity6 , is quietly fighting for his life at @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity6 was born at 35 weeks with an extremely rare brain disorder , @entity12 , which means he will never cry or feed properly , and will probably not live past the age of five			1
' we just want him to cry , ' ms @entity14 told the @entity16			2
@entity6 's brain is abnormally smooth , without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses			1
' i had to come to terms with @entity6 possibly being blind , deaf and having seizures , ' wrote his mother to a @entity35 page marking her son 's journey			1
' the word seizure makes me gasp			0
it is a fact and it will happen			0
' a rare birth defect of the brain caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short ( p ) arm of chromosome 17			1
people with lissencephaly have an abnormally smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which cause intellectual disability , seizures , abnormal muscle stiffness ( spasticity ) , weak muscle tone ( hypotonia ) , and feeding difficulties			2
feeding and swallowing problems are common , and can be complicated by aspiration pneumonia			0
seizures usually begin before six months of age , and some occur from birth			0
children with this condition usually die in infancy or childhood and it is normally caused by respiratory complications			1
@entity71 is usually not inherited from the parents a milestone for the family was when @entity6 managed to suck 6 - 10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed			1
another was when they heard him ' squeak '			0
' @entity6 has no ability to cry however we also witnessed a sound today when he got restless			1
. not a cry or scream but definitely a squeak ! , ' ms @entity14 posted			2
but after just four days at home , @entity6 developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency			2
his mother thought he was dieing			0
' @entity90 & i watched @entity6 lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air , dropping saturations & an excessively weak heart rate , white with blue lips , eyes rolled in his head , body flopped , ' she said			2
@entity100 is now recovering with mum in hospital			0
she calls him her ' silent fire			0
' ' today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things i can not change for my son and except reality as it challenges me , ' ms @entity14 wrote on saturday			0
' no one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ... stand up , be an advocate for your child , do n't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because i learnt today that i 'm educated in what a palliative care patient is			1
' @entity14 with her son @entity6 who has been diagnosed with @entity126 , a rare congenital birth defect with no cure the @entity128 say it is especially hard to explain to their older sons , @entity131 and @entity132 , what is happening to their baby brother			1
but they hope to be home as a family again soon			2
friends and family have launched a @entity141 fundraising campaign to help pay for @entity6 's care and more research into the condition			1
they hope to raise $ 100,000			1
' research is majorly lacking in @entity146 , ' @entity2 told @entity147			0
' the more awareness the better for other families			0
' the campaign has so far raised over $ 11,000			0
' with this current money we can provide @entity6 with a respiratory sleep machine , correct bedding and feeding apparatus at home for the next few months without having to worry , ' says ms @entity14			2
for now , the family are fighting with @entity6 and trying not to think too far ahead			1
the hardest thing , they say , is ' the not knowing			0
' @entity160 has difficulty taking a bottle by himself and will be lucky to live up to the age of five ' my silent fire ' : friends and family have launched a fundraising campaign to help the @entity128 pay for @entity6 's medical care and greater research into @entity12 in @entity146			1

six - week old @entity160 was born with @entity12 , a rare defect of the brain which means he ca n't cry
@entity6 's family hope to raise $ 100,000 to pay for his care and brain research
there is no cure for the condition and babies rarely live out their childhood
