once outside , she saw the school and @entity40 had tried several times to call her , so she rang them			1

@entity2 walked the 1.5 mile route through woodland and roads he barely knew from his nursery on @entity84 to his home in @entity86 , @entity41 ‘ then within seconds , i got a phone call from my next - door neighbour saying @entity2 had arrived home			1
i burst into tears with relief			0
that night , i could n’t sleep			0
i just kept thinking of what could have happened			0
’ yesterday @entity2 explained his journey home , saying : ‘ i walked past the lollipop lady and she went on to the road and stopped all the cars and then i went over the road and down an alley and came home			2
’ he was vaguely familiar with part of the route , having used it during summer bike rides with his father @entity105 , a maintenance engineer			0

@entity2 went missing from @entity40 playgroup in @entity41
it happened during the *cross-over* between nursery and after school - club
his mother @entity0 was called by staff and told ' we seem to have lost @entity2 '
she raced to nursery but a neighbour called soon after to say he *'d* arrived
he had only *joined* the nursery that day and had found his way home alone
