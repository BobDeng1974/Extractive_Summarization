@entity1 have been criticised for selling key rings that seem to promote drink driving at the same time as police are trying to crack down on the illegal activity during the festive season motoring groups have called the £ 1.99 items ' silly ' and ' irresponsible ' and are asking people not to buy them ' they make light of a serious problem on @entity8 roads - traffic is the biggest killer of young people			1
' a combination of age and inexperience , means that young drivers are hugely overrepresented in road crashes			0
she stressed it 's particularly important to send out the right messages to young drivers as they are more likely to take risks and are less able to deal with the consequences of the risks			0
' that ’s why it ’s so important that we send out the right messages to young drivers - that risk taking on roads is deadly serious			0

' do n’t they know how many people die every year because of drink driving ? '' @entity77 , director of policy for the @entity79 said : ' these are silly gifts for silly people			1
' clearly these keyrings are totally out of touch with most people ’s views on driving - sadly safety messages are n’t seen as being as cool as this sort of thing			2
they ca n’t be banned , so our simple message is do n’t buy one			0
@entity93 , director of @entity94 , also criticised the key rings : ' alcohol and cars just do n’t mix , ' obviously these key rings are supposed to be a bit of a laugh , but i doubt anyone who ’s suffered as a result of drink driving will see the funny side			1
' the novelty items , which @entity1 described as ' fun ' , were on display with @entity109 products at the checkout the key chains were seen on display at the motoring chain 's @entity65 store ( pictured ) , but were also thought to be on sale in stores across the @entity8 the government advises that any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive and say ' it ’s better to have none for the road '			1
