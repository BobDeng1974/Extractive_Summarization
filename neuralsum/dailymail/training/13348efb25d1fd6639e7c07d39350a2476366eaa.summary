@entity28 said : ' it 's always interesting to visit new circuits			0
' it 's fun to get out and explore the contours of the track , the kerbs , the run - offs , the camber			2
' they 're all the things you do n't really fully experience until you 're on - site and able to see the track for the very first time			0
that 'll be my priority on thursday			0
' assessing the venue from what he has seen so far via a simulator , @entity0 added : ' from what i 've seen of the place it 's sort of a mix between the tracks we raced on in @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity0 in action during a wet @entity55 @entity9 on sunday in his @entity56 the @entity57 says he expects the @entity18 track to be a mix between @entity60 and @entity53 ' there are plenty of long , fast straights hemmed in by concrete walls and high barriers , and a selection of medium - speed corners that seem to have been designed to test the abilities of a car			1
' as with all these new venues , they only really begin to unlock themselves once you get out on the track for the first time			0
' i 've lost none of my enthusiasm for going to new places , so i 'll be keen to get out there on friday and get a feel for the place			0
