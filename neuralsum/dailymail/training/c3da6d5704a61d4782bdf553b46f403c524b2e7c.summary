by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 5 june 2013 drugs used for treating alzheimer 's disease may protect against heart attacks and death , claim researchers			2
scientists found medication such as @entity8 was linked to a 38 per cent cut in the risk of heart attack , compared with people suffering dementia not taking it			1
those on the highest doses of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors ( @entity16 ) , which are used to treat mild to moderate disease , got the greatest reduction in risk			1
research claims : drugs used for treating alzheimer 's disease may protect against heart attacks and death the drugs are thought to have a beneficial effect on the vagus nerve , which controls how fast the heart beats , and may be anti-inflammatory			1
professor @entity26 , of @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , who led the study , which included the drugs donepezil ( @entity8 ) , rivastigmine and galantamine			2
he said : ' if you translate these reductions in risk into absolute figures , it means that for every 100,000 people with alzheimer 's disease , there would be 180 fewer heart attacks - 295 as opposed to 475 - and 1125 fewer deaths from all causes - 2000 versus 3125 - every year among those taking @entity16 compared to those not using them			1
' as far as we know , this is the first time that the use of @entity16 has been linked to a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in general or from any cause			2
' in the study over 7,000 people with @entity57 's were monitored from may 2007 to december 2010 , says a report in the @entity60			0
those who were on @entity16 had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from any cause , a 38 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack and a 26 per cent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes such as stroke compared to people not taking @entity72			1
patients taking the highest recommended doses of @entity16 had the lowest risk of heart attack or death : 65 per cent and 46 per cent lower compared with those who had never used @entity16			1
in hospital : those on @entity72 had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from any cause and a 26 per cent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes compared to people not taking @entity72 the researchers also checked whether the cut in risk applied to other drug treatments for dementia such as memantine , which works in a different way , but it made no difference to the risk of heart attack or death from any cause			1
prof @entity26 said : ' we can not say that @entity95 use is causing the reduction in risk , only that it is associated with a reduction			0
' as far as we know , this is the first time that the use of @entity16 has been linked to a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in general or from any cause ' professor @entity26 , @entity27 ' however , the strengths of the associations make them very interesting from the clinical point of view , although no clinical recommendations should be made on the basis of the results from our study			2
' it would be of great value if a meta - analysis of previous , randomised controlled trials could be performed , as this might produce answers on which clinical recommendations could be based			0
' as the findings came from a nationwide group of patients , prof @entity26 said they were likely to apply to other countries			0
@entity126 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity128 , said : ' the link between this particular @entity57 's medication and heart health is interesting , but by no means definitive			0
' we do n't know if the medication itself caused the drop in heart attack risk or if another factor was involved			1
this is the first study to link an @entity57 's medication to reduced risk of heart attacks so we need to see much more research before we can draw any conclusions			0
' in the meantime , there 's lots you can do to protect your heart without a prescription			0
quitting smoking , eating a balanced diet and getting enough exercise are all great ways to keep your heart healthy			0
if you 're over 40 you can ask your gp for a free health check			0

scientists found @entity8 was linked to 38 *%* cut in the risk of heart attack
that figure was compared with people suffering dementia not taking it
those on highest doses of drugs called @entity72 got biggest risk reduction
the drugs are thought to have a beneficial effect on the vagus nerve
