@entity0 thought occasions like this had passed him by and you might say it passed him by again			1
first start for two - and - a - half years and then hooked after 45 minutes			1
every silver lining comes with its own cloud			0
it just goes to emphasise how fleeting chances can be in international sport and how vital it is to grasp your opportunity when it comes and make the most of it			0
take a bow @entity15 , who has proved precisely how it can be done			0
only four days into his @entity18 career and @entity15 , who extinguished the threat of winger @entity21 on tuesday night , looks like he will take some moving from the right back spot			1
@entity28 is strong and quick and more composed on the ball in the heat of @entity37 than a teenager has any right to be			1
he will surely improve as a defender as he matures , just as @entity41 has rapidly developed as a deep - lying playmaker , because he has the necessary tools and a good football brain			2
@entity41 has been outstanding in the last four @entity18 games , dictating tempo , organising those around him , passing the ball , biting in the tackle and controlling his instinct to dribble the dangerous areas			1
@entity15 extinguished the threat of @entity21 on tuesday night in his second @entity18 game he also produced the pass of the match for @entity56 to score the opener			1
it was an @entity18 goal made in @entity59 , with a little help from @entity61			1
eight of @entity64 ’s 22 - man squad have strong connections to @entity61			2
but where the @entity67 flourished , with a reminder of his energy and his goal threat , @entity0 ’s chance came and went			2
he held his shape on the left of a tight midfield trio , with @entity41 and @entity76 , and patrolled the areas he was expected to			0
but the ability to produce something special under intense scrutiny is what international football is about , especially if your role carries creative responsibilities			0
@entity28 's hour on the pitch issued a warning to left back rivals @entity33 and @entity34 @entity90 came on and immediately the team played with a happier rhythm , with more balance			2
@entity0 is entitled to counter that the hardest part of tuesday night ’s game was the opening half - hour , where @entity18 had to be disciplined			1
he played his part in helping @entity18 take the lead and take a grip			2
they were two up within minutes of @entity90 coming on , and he was able to play with more freedom			2
he may not have @entity0 ’s determination to track back to the edges of his own penalty box simply to deny the opponents space , but @entity107 were a wilting force by then			1
spaces were starting to open up and @entity90 ’s fluency does not help @entity0 ’s chances of adding to his 35 caps			1
at the age of 30 , will he be back ? who knows who will be fit and in form by the time these players meet again for international duty in march			0
@entity0 did nothing wrong but lacked the creativity to produce something special when it matters @entity0 ’s confidence has been built at @entity123			1
the test is to return to @entity125 and impress again			0
according to @entity127 ’s statistics , he has created 34 chances , more than any other @entity130 player in the @entity131 this season			0
modern coaches love to have tactical flexibility at their disposal and his ability to play in different roles is an advantage			0
it has helped him into tournament squads in the past , but it will only help again if his form holds			0
too often in this match his touch let him down			0
it might have been nerves playing their part			0
he found it hard to get on the ball as @entity107 disrupted @entity18 during an opening passage of play which was still reverberating from an extraordinary pre-match atmosphere featuring flames and bagpipes ( together at last , although perhaps not in a way the @entity130 were hoping )			1
@entity0 falls over a ducking @entity155 during an unimpressive performance for the @entity123 star amid the din , @entity0 ’s first touch was inconsistent			1
poor control encouraged @entity161 to snap into an early tackle which had @entity18 ’s no 8 hopping around in pain			2
having aggravated an injury during the warm - up at @entity167 on saturday , he did not want another setback			0
perhaps this was a factor in his subdued performance			0
others were able to thrive in the atmosphere and @entity64 will be delighted with the work - rate and willingness to match @entity107 ’s aggression and desire			1
@entity177 , another enjoying the rare treat of an international start , might have liked more activity to prove what he can do but it is a fine line for a goalkeeper			0
@entity177 was alert to save from @entity184 , when he needed to be , but could not protect his clean sheet			0
as for @entity0 , he will hope there is another chance to come next year			2
if there is n’t , this was a night for all @entity18 players to savour : an @entity18 win in @entity192 .			1

@entity18 defeated @entity107 3 - 1 at @entity37 on tuesday night
@entity0 made first @entity18 start for two and a half years
the @entity123 midfielder was replaced by @entity90 at half - time
