an unnamed man approached him in a pub suggested @entity0 turned his home into a cannabis farm to pay off his loan			1
but his crop of the drug , worth £ 115,000 in total , was seized when police raided it on may 19			1
his decision was similar to the one taken in drama series @entity7 where terminally - ill chemistry teacher @entity42 turns into a drug baron to ensure his family 's financial future			1
@entity46 , defending , said : ' the state of his finances was very much concerning to him and then he attended the funeral of his nephew			0
' that young man was in debt , heavily in debt , and the defendant saw the impact of that on his family			0
' he saw the upset and distress it had caused to them , and it concerned him , him being in ill health , the level of debt he was leaving to his family			0
' youngs suffered his third heart attack on the day he was due to be sentenced for producing cannabis , the court heard			2

he was jailed for five years in 1962 for wounding with intent , and for four years in 1974 for non-dwelling burglaries and theft			2

he was given a two - year prison sentence , suspended for two years and will also be supervised for 12 months			0
the judge said a prison sentence was called for , but he accepted that @entity0 had done his ' level best to lead a decent life ' in recent years , and because of his ill health , and other mitigating features , he was able to suspend the sentence			2
he said : ' to suggest that you were naive , i think , is absolute nonsense			0
' this was a sophisticated set - up and you were more than happy to go along with it			0
' at the age of 74 , it 's very sad to see a man who had managed to turn his life around back in court facing a charge like this			0
