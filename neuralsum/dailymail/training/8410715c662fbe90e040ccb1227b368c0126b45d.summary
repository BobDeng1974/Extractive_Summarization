by @entity1 reporter published : 16:07 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 16:21 est , 10 january 2014 @entity3 has released a family portrait styled like the poster for @entity6			1
the former @entity8 presidential candidate posted the picture of her family on her @entity12 account but gave no explanation for why they were dressed in black tie attire or when the photo was taken			2
and considering the acclaimed series ' fourth season premiered last sunday , the reference is either five days too late for the first episode or two days too early for the second			0
best guess : congresswoman @entity3 posted this family portrait on thursday the @entity3 's imitation of the @entity26 family looks like a fair interpretation but two key components are missing : any staff and a grand manor house in the background			1
instead of taking their unusual portrait in front of their @entity38 home , the politician 's family apparently decided that the january temperatures were not befitting the bare arms that the ladies had as a result of their sleeveless gowns			2
mrs @entity3 stands next to her husband @entity45 and is flanked by their five children - @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52			1
the eighth person in the photo is @entity55 , who is dating @entity48			0
inspiration : a large staff and massive estate were two of the missing parts in the @entity3 's version though mrs @entity3 shared the photo on @entity12 yesterday , it was actually her daughter @entity52 who posted it originally to her @entity66 profile with the caption ' @entity68 '			1
many commentators praised @entity52 's posting , saying that it was ' fantastic ' and hilarious , while the comments were much more harsh on mrs @entity3 's @entity12 post			0
some likened it to the promo photos for @entity76 , @entity78 's @entity77 , @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 .			0
