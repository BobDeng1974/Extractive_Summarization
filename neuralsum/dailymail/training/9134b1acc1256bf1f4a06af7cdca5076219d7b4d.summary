by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 14 february 2013 new sat - nav technology will tell drivers how much to adjust their speed to sail through uninterrupted green lights			1
the project , masterminded by academics at @entity7 , is being developed to ease traffic jams , as well as cut the pollution caused by start - stop driving			1
set for trials in @entity7 and a range of other @entity15 cities , the system will set a particular speed to ensure vehicles hit the next four sets of traffic lights before they turn to red			1
soon to be a thing of the past : @entity7 is to trial a new sat - nav technology which will help drivers avoid heavy traffic and could even tell them how fast to drive to avoid getting caught by red lights @entity28 , professor of intelligent transport systems at @entity7 , said : ' what 's unique about this trial is that we will be giving information directly to the driver			1
' for example , the system might advise a driver that if they travel at 24 miles an hour they will hit the next four sets of traffic lights on green			1
' in more congested areas or particularly busy times of the day , then key roads might be given priority in order to keep the traffic flowing			0
' two other benefits of the system will be a forward collision warning and a red light violation warning , which tells drivers when someone has jumped a red light			1
' unique ' : @entity28 , professor of intelligent transport systems at @entity7 , is one of the academics behind the £ 8.6million scheme the pilot is part of a £ 8.6million project called @entity62 involving @entity7 and six other @entity15 cities			2
dr @entity64 , from @entity7 , who is leading the project in the @entity66 , said : ' @entity7 is already leading the way in intelligent transport systems and this work will allow us to build on the infrastructure that is already in place to provide personalised information to drivers			0
' every year there are more cars on the road and although there are initiatives in place to keep our cities moving congestion is still a major problem			0
' and it ’s not just car drivers			0
by creating a joined - up information system for all road users we can give other users such as the emergency services and bus drivers information which can help them get to their destination quickly and safely			1
' the new project will link an in - vehicle communication system directly with the @entity7 ’s @entity97			2
information collected by the centre will be sent directly to drivers , warning them away from jams to speed up journeys through the city and ease traffic congestion			1
at the same time , drivers can also be warned of approaching danger such as an accident or reckless driver			2
among the systems being implemented by the team are : @entity110 's @entity97 : the centre will send updates to drivers warning them of congestion and approaching danger or how fast they need to drive to move efficiently @entity110 's @entity97 : the centre will send updates to drivers warning them of congestion and approaching danger or how fast they need to drive to move efficiently other cities taking part in the @entity15 - wide project include : @entity122 , @entity123 ; @entity124 , @entity125 ; @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ; @entity130 , @entity131 ; and @entity132 in @entity133			2
councillor @entity134 , deputy cabinet member for environment and transport at @entity137 , said : ' @entity137 supports co-operation with @entity15 partners as a means of learning from one another to address our common challenges			0
' by being outward facing , the free flow of ideas and experiences can help all cities meet their goals for a cleaner environment			0
in particular , @entity150 builds on our strong track record in @entity153 , benefiting from our close links with the @entity7			0
' as partners , we will actively support @entity62 as we share its vision towards developing sustainable transport solutions , safety and environmental care			0
' professor @entity160 added : ' this project builds on many other world - leading research projects that the @entity7 has led over the years - bringing @entity164 to @entity7			0
' the in - vehicle unit will communicate with the smart traffic lights controlled by the city ’s @entity97			1
' this will be the first trial of its kind in the @entity66 , putting the city at the forefront of new and innovative thinking as to how emerging technologies can help us better manage our increasingly congested roads in the future			0

aims to ease traffic jams and cut pollution caused by start - stop driving
system will be trialled in seven cities across @entity15
information will tell drivers about road conditions around the town
a @entity192 , which notifies drivers of *obstacles* on the road such as an accident , broken down vehicle or even just *stationary* traffic
a @entity200 , which tells drivers when someone on the road ahead has jumped a red light
and an @entity207 service , which advises the driver of the best speed in order to pass through a series of traffic lights on green .
