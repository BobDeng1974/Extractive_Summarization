it was the most eagerly anticipated handset launch this year , and now @entity2 ’s @entity1 has been named the fastest on the market			1
independent researchers tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from @entity2 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
processing speed determines how quickly the phones can open apps , play videos and games , multitask and more			1
@entity2 ’s @entity16 came out on top in which ? magazine ’s poll , ahead of the firm ’s supersized @entity22 and @entity8 ’s @entity21			1
independent researchers tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from @entity2 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
they found that @entity2 's @entity16 was the fastest , followed by the firm 's larger @entity16 6 plus handset and the @entity21 ( all pictured ) @entity2 's older @entity26 model came fourth , followed by the @entity9 and @entity27			1
the @entity28 came in seventh place , ahead of the @entity10 and @entity30			0
however , in a blog post which ? noted that ‘ we ’re only ever a month or two away from the next breakthrough in mobile phone speed			0
‘ the @entity16 and @entity22 might be the fastest smartphones around right now , but do n’t expect that to last for long			2
’ experts will soon test the raw speed of @entity8 ’s @entity40 and @entity41 , which are both expected to give @entity2 ’s new handsets a run for their money			1
to put the phones through their paces , researchers used ‘ @entity50 software ’ to calculate their speed			2
this graphic shows how they compare - with @entity2 performing well to put the phones through their paces , researchers used ‘ @entity50 software ’ to calculate their speed			2
the software is designed to replicate how people use their phones in the real world and calculates single and multi-core performance			0
the phones were given a score for the numerous performance tests , which were then combined and weighted			0
the higher a phone 's score , the better and faster it is and if a score is double , for example , the phone offers double the performance			0
the raw speed of @entity8 ’s @entity40 ( pictured left ) and @entity41 ( right ) - which have yet to be tested - are both expected to give @entity2 ’s new handsets a run for their money both the @entity16 and @entity22 models have a dual core , @entity74 processor			1
their rivals , such as the @entity21 have quad - core processors			0
quad - core processors are believed to be faster , yet having more cores does n't necessarily increase speed			0
it instead increases the phone 's ability to do more things at once , faster , which is a small but significant distinction			0
last year , which ? crowned the @entity26 the fastest phone , followed by @entity10 's @entity88 and the @entity89			0
the @entity26 was recorded to have a multi-core speed of 3,971 , which is almost 600 points lower than this year ’s fastest – the @entity16 6 at 4,569 – showing how quickly technology improves			2
while processor speed matters when it comes to opening apps and playing games , which ? did not compare the quality of the phones ’ cameras or screens .			2

independent researchers at which ? tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from @entity2 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10
processing speed determines how quickly the phones can open apps , play videos and games , multitask and more
@entity2 's @entity16 came first , followed by the @entity22 and @entity21
the speed of @entity8 ’s @entity40 and @entity41 are yet to be tested and it 's thought both could be as fast as @entity2 ’s new handsets
