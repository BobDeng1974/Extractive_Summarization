' the last campaign i let everyone down , but @entity1 had a word with me and it really hit home			0
i 'm probably glad he did that , ' said the man who now occupies second place on @entity2 's scoring charts with 14			1
' @entity1 is the best manager i 've played under and he gets the best from me and pulls me to one side before every game			0

i scored two goals which is brilliant for me personally , but if i do n't score another goal in the campaign and we qualify i 'll be happy enough			2

but belief is starting to turn to expectation before the players ' eyes			0
