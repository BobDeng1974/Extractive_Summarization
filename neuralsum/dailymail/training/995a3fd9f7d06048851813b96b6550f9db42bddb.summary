by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 02:12 est , 15 august 2012 rail passengers face fare rises of up to 11 per cent next year after a higher - than - expected jump in the inflation rate			1
the increases will add hundreds of pounds to annual season tickets , with some commuters seeing season ticket fares to @entity10 crash through the £ 6,000 barrier			2
and there is no end in sight to the inflation - busting hikes , as ministers admitted they will continue every year until at least 2015			1
from next january 1 , train firms can raise their ‘ regulated ’ fares – which include rush - hour commuter travel , season tickets and off - peak fares – by three percentage points more than the @entity24 inflation figure for july , which was revealed yesterday as 3.2 per cent			1
that means commuter and other ‘ regulated ’ fares will be allowed to rise by 6.2 per cent			1
but the companies also have the flexibility to add another 5 per cent to respond to changes in demand for particular services – meaning some fares could rise by 11.2 per cent			1
if they do so , they will have to make fare cuts elsewhere in compensation			0
ministers said the extra cash from fare - payers was needed to fund billions of pounds of rail investment			2
but passenger groups , campaigners and unions said it was a ‘ rip - off ’ and yet another ‘ @entity63 ’ that would benefit only rail bosses and their bonus pots at the expense of hard - pressed travellers and commuters			2
rail fares have risen by more than inflation every year for the past ten years			1
rail passenger groups , transport campaigners and unions yesterday held protests at more than 40 stations			0
they called on transport secretary @entity77 to rein back on the rises , which come at a time when @entity80 has some of the highest fares in @entity82 and when passengers spend up to 15 per cent of their income on commuting			0
the @entity85 said commuters from @entity87 in @entity88 could see their annual fare rise to £ 4,872 from next year , a £ 284 increase			2
those commuting from @entity92 face a £ 356 rise to £ 6,104			0
a season ticket from @entity95 to @entity96 will increase by £ 167 to £ 2,855 ; @entity97 to @entity98 will rise by £ 331 to £ 5,663 ; @entity99 to @entity100 will go up by £ 183 to £ 3,127 ; and @entity101 to @entity102 by £ 133 to £ 2,281			0
by 2015 the annual cost of commuting to @entity10 from @entity104 will have soared from £ 9,004 to £ 10,663 , which accounts for 28 per cent of the average @entity10 salary , says the campaign group			0
' cut rail fares , not rail staff ' : protesters at @entity111 this morning hold a banner as part of a demonstration against the continued hikes in rail fares the group ’s chief executive @entity117 said : ‘ if the government sticks by its policy , rail fares will rise three times faster than salaries			1
with the economy flat - lining , this is untenable			0
our railways need to be affordable to ordinary people , not just “ train - toffs ” on high incomes			0
’ miss @entity77 said she would try to persuade the chancellor to cut the ‘ inflation plus 3 per cent ’ formula down to ‘ inflation plus 1 per cent ’ for the next two years			1
treasury sources indicated last night that there was no scope to make the cut			0
@entity137 , leader of the @entity138 , said : ‘ this is a bigger rip - off than the @entity63			0
‘ this money will not be invested back in services , it will be trousered by the greedy train operators			0
’ @entity144 , chief executive of the @entity145 , said : ‘ the government decides the average increase of commuter ticket prices and other regulated fares which train companies will be required to introduce in january			1
’ the row comes as sir @entity153 ’s @entity152 is expected to lose its franchise to run the @entity156 mainline to arch - rival @entity158 , which is understood to have offered up to £ 7billion for a 14 - year contract			2
rail fares protesters wearing evening dress sit in mock @entity163 pose a photo of @entity165 's exclusive @entity163 from 1986 , featuring @entity166 , now mayor of @entity10			1

latest inflation figures put @entity24 at 3.2 per cent - up from *2.8* per cent in june
the government is allowing rail companies to increase average prices by @entity24 plus 3 per cent , making average increases of 6.2 per cent
campaigners warn that *unregulated* fares , to which an extra 5 per cent can be added , could now rise by up to 11 per cent
rail fares have now risen by more than inflation every year for the past ten years in a row
