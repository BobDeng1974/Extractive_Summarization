a woman has created a unique family album by photoshopping herself into snapshots from her mother 's childhood , in order to imagine the kind of friendship that the two might have shared growing up			1
@entity9 , an art director from @entity10 , @entity11 , managed to seamlessly merge a series of images of herself as a child with older snapshots of her mother in order to create the heartwarming collection of photos , titled if i had known my mother back then			1
' i 've always wondered if my mom and i would have been friends had we grown up together , ' @entity9 wrote on her website			2
then and now : @entity9 ( left ) wanted to imagine a friendship between her mother and herself peas in a pod : in many of the images , it 's almost impossible to tell which person is which friends forever : @entity9 ( right ) and her mother are as close now as they would have been back then ' would we be in the same classes ? would we have the same sense of humor ? would people tell us we were inseparable ? ' after seeing myself in her childhood photos , i 'm pretty sure we would have been great friends			1
' the images show the pair ' posing ' together at various stages of their lives , from early childhood right up until what appears to be their teenage years			0
in one of the snaps , @entity9 has edited herself into an image so it seems she is posing alongside her mother before a night out , with both women sporting smart dresses and glamorous make - up looks			2
in another , the pair can be seen as young children wearing costumes , perhaps in preparation for @entity65			0
@entity9 revealed to @entity66 that the whole process to six months to complete			2
' it took about six months ; harassing my mother to send me every old photo of her life was tricky because we had lost the majority of both our childhood photos when @entity77 destroyed our home in @entity79 , @entity80 , ' the 25 - year - old said			2
' so i had a limited amount of photos to work with			0
' i 'm pretty sure we would have been great friends ' : writing on her website , @entity9 confessed that she thinks the pair would have bonded charmed : in this image , @entity9 ( left ) is actually wearing her mother 's charm bracelet ' i scanned all the images where we were the closest in age , and hunted through my @entity93 photo albums to find childhood photos of myself			1
from there , i tried different juxtapositions in @entity97 trying to tell the story of two little girls growing up together			0
' i 'm really happy with how the project turned out			0
i was surprised at how natural the interactions were considering i was working with images of two little girls born a generation apart			0
' in addition to posting the images on her site , @entity9 also took the opportunity to pay tribute to her mother , writing : ' @entity110 for being the same friend to me now , that you would have been then			1
' @entity9 confessed that she gave her mother little warning about the project and asked her to send the childhood snaps without knowing what they would be used for			1
unsurprisingly however , her mom was thrilled with the outcome			0
friendly fun : @entity9 managed to seamlessly merge herself into many of the images ' [ my mom ] is miles away so i did n't get to see her reaction in person , but she tells me it 's just so special , ' @entity9 added			2
' she looks at the site everyday - well now she calls it our site - and it makes her cry			0
' she made an interesting comment about how it feels really deja vu , which is strange , almost as if now when she thinks back on those moments from her childhood i was actually there			0
' in many of the images , it 's almost impossible to separate @entity9 from her mother thanks to the art director 's seamless editing process			1
and in the final photo shared by @entity9 , a recent picture of herself with her mother , it 's clear to see that the pair still bear an uncanny resemblance to one another , despite being separated in age .			1

@entity9 , 25 , wanted to imagine a childhood friendship with her mom
the art director titled the picture project if i had known my mother back then
she thanked her mom for being ' the same friend to me now , that you would have been then '
