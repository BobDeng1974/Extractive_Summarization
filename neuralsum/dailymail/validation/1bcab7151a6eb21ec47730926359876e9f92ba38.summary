' ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night , ' said @entity1 , one of four men condemned to death for the hideous sex attack that shocked the world two years ago			1
' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy			2
boy and girl are not equal			0
housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes			0
' about 20 per cent of girls are good			0
' the depraved murder of @entity5 in december 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in @entity41 , where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women			1

once inside , bus driver @entity1 , his brother @entity51 , gym instructor @entity52 , 20 , bus cleaner @entity53 , 28 , fruit - seller @entity55 , 19 , and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape			1
she died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen , genitals and intestines			0

but even today , @entity1 remains unrepentant			1

' when being raped , she should n't fight back			2
she should just be silent and allow the rape , ' he said			1
' then they 'd have dropped her off after " doing her " , and only hit [ her friend ] the boy			0
' his impending execution , he suggests , is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims			2
' the death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls , ' he said			2
' now when they rape , they wo n't leave the girl like we did			2
' before , they would rape and say , " leave her , she wo n't tell anyone			0
" now when they rape , especially the criminal types , they will just kill the girl			0
' @entity1 and his accomplices treated @entity65 no better			1
after luring her aboard the bus , they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off			0
two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus ; medical staff confirmed that ' it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals , uterus and intestines '			1
and after the rapists had enough , rather than ' dropping her off ' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus			0
@entity1 then allegedly tried to run them over , but her friend had enough strength left to pull @entity65 out of the way			1
despite efforts to get her the best medical care , even flying her to a hospital in @entity132 , @entity65 died 13 days later , having suffered brain damage , pneumonia , and abdominal infection			0

it was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about @entity65 's death for filmmaker ms @entity76 it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary , but the outpouring of anger in @entity41 at the social conditions that allowed it to happen			1
' when news of this gang - rape hit our tv screens in december 2012 , i was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of ‘ civilised ’ society , ' she said			2
' but what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape			0
' courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of @entity41 braved the december freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers , withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells , lathi charges and water canons , to make heard their cry of " enough is enough "			2

in my lifetime , i ca n’t recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women ’s rights			0
