@entity1 travel to @entity2 on sunday having won their opening two @entity5 qualifying matches			1
@entity7 's men followed up september 's 2 - 0 victory in @entity9 with a 5 - 0 win against @entity11 at @entity12 on thursday night			1
here , @entity13 looks at the three men who will be looking to ruin @entity1 's perfect start			1
@entity17 's @entity16 ( second from right ) scores to secure a 1 - 0 win against @entity2 in qualifying @entity2 's @entity21 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity17 's @entity24 ( left ) in @entity25 on thursday @entity27 ’s midfield partner @entity28 position : manager age : 38 previous clubs : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 only hardcore @entity39 fans will remember @entity28 ’s one - month loan spell in @entity1			1
with @entity41 in charge of the side in 1996 , @entity28 played just once , alongside @entity27 in central midfield			1
@entity2 manager @entity28 will be hoping to ruin @entity1 's perfect start to qualification @entity28 played alongside @entity27 ( pictured ) for @entity39 during a loan spell back in 1996 @entity48 may also remember @entity28			1
he was manager of @entity50 side @entity34 , who almost knocked them out of the @entity53 in 2009			2
@entity39 were cruising 2 - 0 ahead from the first leg and there were five minutes to play in the second with the score goalless when @entity34 netted twice , including a stoppage - time penalty			0
@entity59 was the eventual hero as @entity39 edged through 4 - 3 on penalties			0
@entity28 has also worked alongside @entity1 manager @entity7 on a number of occasions as a pundit for @entity66 television			1
@entity68 bargain @entity69 position : forward age : 25 previous clubs : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 @entity77 forward @entity69 was @entity68 manager @entity79 ’s first signing in his so far short but torrid time at the club			2
@entity2 forward @entity69 , pictured against @entity82 , joined @entity68 on a one - year deal in july he was the first of 14 free or dirt - cheap players as @entity86 had to sign virtually an entire new first team with barely any money			2
@entity69 moved from @entity89 side @entity74 , where he had spent six years , for free on a one - year deal			0
he is yet to score for @entity68 in 10 games and they are second - from - bottom in the @entity5			2
but @entity1 would be wise not to underestimate him			2
@entity69 surprised the @entity93 by scoring against them in a @entity96 qualifier			0
@entity69 looks to keep the pace with @entity17 's @entity98 during @entity2 's @entity100 defeat the chemist @entity102 position : striker age : 28 previous clubs : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 @entity102 has been nicknamed ‘ @entity114 ’ back in @entity2 due to having completed a degree in chemistry			1
it is also , apparently , due to his chemistry in the box , according to @entity77 media , yet that does not extend to the international scene			0
@entity102 has scored just one goal in five appearances for their national side , and that was in a friendly against @entity126 , who are not even recognised by @entity128 as an official team			0
he is , however , taking to the @entity130 well			0
that is where @entity102 now plies his trade , at @entity134 , and he is one of the league ’s leading scorers with eight this season , two off the top			0
previous to that move , @entity102 spent his entire career playing for @entity77 club sides .			0

@entity1 face @entity2 in next @entity5 qualifying match on sunday evening
@entity7 's side have *beaten* @entity9 and @entity11
@entity2 manager @entity28 will be looking to ruin @entity1 's perfect start in @entity100
