@entity0 has been heavily criticized by customers after listing a black @entity3 doll on its website for two times the price of the near - identical white alternative			1
according to @entity8 , the glaring error was first brought to the attention of the retailer - and the public - by @entity11 resident @entity10 , who noticed the bizarre price discrepancy when he logged onto the @entity0 website to buy a @entity14 present for his daughter			1
after noticing the difference in cost between the @entity18 , which was until recently priced at $ 23.49 , and the @entity19 , which was priced at $ 49.99 , the outraged 30 - year - old contacted the store to ask why there was such a difference in price between the two toys			2
spot the difference : @entity0 had listed these two near - identical dolls for two very different prices , with the black version costing more than double the price of the white one ' it rubbed me the wrong way ' : @entity11 resident @entity10 was furious when he saw the difference in price between the two dolls the 30 - year - old spoke to three different stores and while two told him the price difference was an error , a third admitted that the white doll was cheaper because it was more popular with customers			1
an official spokesperson from @entity0 's corporate office was quick to reject this theory however , but admitted that she could not give any real reason as to what could possibly make one doll so much more expensive than the other			2
' [ the @entity0 saleswoman ] was speechless and said she really did nâ€™t have an explanation and she was apologetic , and she told us that a change would be made , ' mr @entity10 told @entity8			0
' then she gave us the doll for the price that the white doll was			2
' he added to local @entity11 news station @entity56 : ' when my daughter asked the question " why is the black doll more expensive than the white doll ? " i really did n't have an answer			2
' it kind of rubbed me the wrong way			0
' @entity0 later released a statement blaming the shocking price discrepancy on a ' system error '			1
' it is never our intention to offend our guests with our product assortment , ' the spokesperson said			0
' both dolls should have reflected the same pricing , however , due to a systems issue this change did not occur			0
repeat offender : @entity78 currently list the black version of the doll for $ 49.99 , more than double the price of its white counterpart discriminatory pricing : online retail giant @entity78 has priced this white @entity3 at $ 17.88 , which is almost a third of the price of the black alternative ' we appreciate the guest bringing this discrepancy to our attention and have since adjusted the pricing and product detail listing			1
if you have any further questions about these items , please let us know			0
' the retailer 's explanation did little to placate its outraged customers , many of whom took to @entity101 to voice their anger at the error			0
hundreds of people responded to mr @entity10 's original tweet , which featured a picture of the two dolls and their different price tags accompanied by the comment ' whats wrong with this picture ? ' with many saying that @entity0 should be made to undergo an official investigation			0
' @entity0 should be fined twice as much , ' one user wrote , while another added : ' what is wrong with you , @entity0 ? ? ' shockingly , @entity0 is not the only retailer to have made the error ; @entity78 is currently listing the two dolls for two completely different prices , with the white toy listed for the bargain price of $ 17.88 , while the black option is still on sale for the full price of $ 49.99 .			1

the retailer has now *increased* the price of the cheaper , white doll to match its black counterpart
both toys are currently on sale for $ 49.99 each on the @entity0 website
a spokesperson for the store blamed the price discrepancy on a ' system error '
@entity78 also lists the two toys with different prices
