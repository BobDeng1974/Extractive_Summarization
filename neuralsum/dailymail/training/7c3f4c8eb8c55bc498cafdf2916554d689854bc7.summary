the reforms are expected to be unveiled before @entity12 following mounting pressure on the government to curb the explosion of shops containing high stakes gambling machines			1
measures being drawn up by ministers will mean local authorities effectively being able to cap the number of bookmakers opening up , according to well - placed sources the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , which represents more than 370 councils in @entity23 and @entity24 , has called for sweeping changes to the licensing system to limit the growth of betting premises			1
@entity29 , chief executive of @entity30 , has also backed calls for councils to be handed greater powers to block new betting shops where there are existing clusters			1
changes to planning rules last year made it easier for bookmakers to convert empty shops on the high street without needing permission			2
over the last decade , the number of betting shops in some areas has doubled			0
campaigners against fixed odds betting terminals ( @entity49 ) , dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of gambling , accused firms of opening more shops to get round limits on the number of machines in each			1
@entity30 's chief executive @entity29 said that he backed calls for councils to be handed greater powers to block new betting shops where there are existing clusters critics of the machines , which allow people to wager up to £ 100 a spin every 20 seconds , say they are highly addictive and have made casino - style gambling accessible on the high street			1
@entity67 ’s 33,000 @entity66 , also dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of gambling , have been under increasing scrutiny in recent months			0
the terminals are increasingly key to the bookmaking industry , now raking in more than £ 1bn a year in profit			0
in january , @entity73 admitted that there is a ‘ problem ’ that needs to be addressed and offered to work with @entity76 to tackle the rising number of betting shops and fixed - odds betting machines			2
@entity76 has suggested putting betting shops in a separate use class so that councils can use planning powers to control the number opening in their area			2
another proposal being considered is to allow councils to consider the ‘ cumulative ’ impact when making licensing decisions which would force betting companies to prove that new shops would not have a negative effect on the local economy or existing @entity93 , the @entity21 ’s licensing spokesman , said : ‘ councils are n’t anti-bookies but need powers to tackle the damage that can be caused to high streets and town centres by the clustering of betting shops			0
‘ planning and licensing controls are supposed to ensure new shops or business will benefit an area but the current system is preventing councils from acting on community concerns			0
the result is many of our high streets becoming saturated with betting shops and councils left powerless to act to limit the number opening up in their area			2
‘ licensing laws must be updated to allow councils to consider the impact a new betting shop would have on their local economy and existing businesses			0
this would protect the power of local communities and democratically - elected councillors to shape their area			0
’ a government source said : ‘ we have said that we will look again at the issue of betting shops and fixed odds betting terminals			0
for now , we would urge local authorities to use the range of powers and tools they already have under gambling and planning legislation where particular problems arise			1
