my son wants to know what will happen if aliens attack @entity4			2
the seven - year - old is lying in bed asking me earnestly about a possible extra-terrestrial war , which he seems to think i 'm in on			2
despite my reassurances , he ’s still worried about imaginary space invaders when i turn out the lamp and leave			2
' nothing will survive , you wo n't feel a thing , ' i mutter on my way downstairs			0
actually there is one thing that would be left if aliens invaded during the summer of 2014			0
there 's only one thing strong enough to survive an intergalactic battle of epic proportions : loom bands			1
there will be no humans ' to experiment on ' as he fears , just a bizarre legacy of billions of piles of multicoloured miniature elastic bands woven into ridiculous neon jewellery			1
craze : children aged three to 11 love making loom bands ( posed by model ) the captain 's log of the invading ship will record that humans were a weird race of accessory - obsessed simpletons			1
and that the bigger ones put the smaller ones to work making all manner of multicoloured whatnots for their own sartorial pleasure			0
the opposite of which is true , of course			0
this week i risked ridicule at work wearing three fluorescent @entity53 bracelets just to please my offspring ( the purple one is grape - scented , they said , ' because we know you like wine ' )			0
rainbow bracelets : the bands can be made in all sizes and colours these tiny bands are everywhere			1
there was one in my cereal bowl this morning , the tumble dryer is full of them and the dog has taken to eating them			0
and when we went swimming this weekend i noticed them lying all over the bottom of the pool			0
this epidemic has caught us by surprise , spreading through my four children , aged three to 11 , as fast a virulent tummy bug			1
they 're all at it , even ' baby @entity82 ' who has taken to looping elastic bands over her toes until they turn red and get ' hurty '			1
it 's worse than the addictive computer game @entity87 that absorbed them last year , worse than the obsessive collecting of the small plastic @entity90 moshlings i kept treading on			1
they start ' looming ' first thing and are still at it when i get in from the office , comparing their different styles			0
@entity97 , ten , has started to make her dad a loom bobble hat which i am really looking forward to him wearing			1
when not actually looming , they watch @entity103 videos of other people doing it , marvelling at the nitwits who have made loom bikinis ( further evidence of our inferior intelligence for alien invaders )			1
they take pictures of their jewellery efforts to send to friends , who are also busy looming away			0
i do n't remember the @entity118 or @entity120 dolls ever being this popular			0
the sensible - mum side of me is thinking of staging an intervention			0
they 've got to go out at some point during the school holidays , have n't they ? plus , where on earth will i store all this tat when they 've outgrown it ? but the ' little - bit - lazy - glad - it 's - not - the - tv - occupying - them ' side of me is secretly relieved and loving the loom			1
besides , the ever - increasing school holidays are costly when you 've got four children to occupy			1
an @entity138 buyer who bid £ 170,100 for a loom band dress made out of 20,000 elastic bands pulled out of the deal , confessing she could n't afford it after our annual family break in @entity146 we have four weeks to fill , which for urban kids is a financial and creative conundrum ( especially when there 's an eight - year age gap in play )			1
i grew up in a @entity154 village on the edge of @entity156 and as a child my younger sister and i would just ' go outside ' to play			0
this is n't an option for city youngsters , so the end of term heralds the start of my role as chief events organiser			0
this year i 've been saved by the unexpected sunshine and the proliferation of @entity169 's ' city seasides '			2
' to the beach , ' i command over breakfast			0
they grip their bag of bands tightly and look at each other nervously for support			2
' i suppose we can loom in the sand , ' remarks @entity97 as they head off for another trip to the fake coast			2
@entity182 is the editor of @entity183 .			1

these tiny bands are everywhere
it 's worse than the addictive computer game @entity87
@entity182 's four children ' loom ' all day
