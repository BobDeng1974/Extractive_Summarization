the political action campaign @entity7 was started by supporters and has not been formally connected or endorsed by the former secretary of state			2
that has n't stopped them from advertising three pages of products on sale at their website ranging for every kind of supporter			2
those who take fashion cues from the former first lady can use lapel pins to show their support			0
pointed message : cell phone covers drawing on the popular ' texts from @entity3 ' @entity27 ( left ) and baby onesies priced at $ 20.16 ( right ) are being sold by the @entity29 for @entity3 pricey product : the most expensive item is the @entity33 tote bag , on sale for $ 60 meme aficionados will recognize the @entity37 case with the picture of her that was used on ' texts from @entity3 ' on the back			1

the @entity77 reports that they have raised a total of $ 4.1million already			1
some of her close advisors at first thought that the @entity29 could be damaging if they were off their official message , but it seems that others have begun to embrace the group - monetarily			0

@entity108 , a @entity109 strategist and head of progressive priorities @entity29 , donated $ 2,500 even though his group will likely end up backing @entity89 as well			1
