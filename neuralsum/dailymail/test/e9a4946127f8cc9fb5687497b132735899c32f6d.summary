@entity6 had been the subject of a permanent domestic violence protection order that prohibited him from ever having firearms when he allegedly bought a @entity15 pistol in january 2013			1

in court : @entity7 walks out of the @entity24 in @entity8 on thursday after he pleaded not guilty to illegally possessing a firearm			1
his son @entity26 used the gun to kill four classmates last year support : @entity6 , who is accused of lying about whether he had a restraining order against him when he bought the gun in january 2013 , attended court with eight friends and family members he allegedly bought the firearm from a gun shop and answered ' no ' on the federal firearms purchasing form when asked if he was the subject of a restraining order that prohibits him from ' harassing , stalking or threatening your child or an intimate partner '			1
@entity6 's lawyer , @entity45 , previously said that ' there was never an order prohibiting him from owning or even purchasing firearms ' from the tribal court			2
the issue in court will be whether he lied on the federal purchasing form , @entity50 said			2
@entity54 , a lawyer with @entity50 's firm who attended the arraignment , said ' there is a distinction between what comes from a state court and a tribal court ' in terms of restrictions placed on the subject of the order			0
@entity54 said they would secure the tribal order through discovery to make that point			0
had the protection order been filed in a state court instead of the tribal court , it would have been entered into a criminal records database and would have surfaced during a background check			1
gunman : @entity6 , a freshman , shot dead four of his classmates then himself last october but the order was never entered into any state or federal criminal databases because of a flawed reporting system between tribes and outside authorities			1

after the @entity90 reported on the problem last week , the @entity89 @entity88 announced that it would host a conference in august with the tribes to try to resolve the problem			0
