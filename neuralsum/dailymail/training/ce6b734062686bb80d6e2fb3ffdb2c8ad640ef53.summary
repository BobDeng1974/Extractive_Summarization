concrete evidence for the existence of @entity2 has so far failed to materialise , but a man who ’s spent 37 years hunting the beast hopes to change all that by funding expeditions using money from an initial public offering ( @entity9 )			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , hopes to raise $ 3million by selling stock in @entity13			1
this money will be funnelled into making dvds , but a large slice - $ 113,805 a year – will be used to fund @entity2 - finding missions			1
this image is from the famous 1968 @entity26 video ‘ capture the creature known as @entity2 ’ is listed as a company priority on documents filed to the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , according to @entity30			1
many are likely to consider this plan unrealistic , but it certainly wo n’t stop the ipo going ahead			0
the @entity29 has said in the past that it ‘ does not evaluate the merits of any ipo or determine whether an investment is appropriate for any investor ’			0
@entity10 told 2014 @entity21 documentary shooting bigfoot : ‘ i 've seen the creature with my own eyes			1
i was 12ft away from one once and i freaked out			0
i made a dedication to myself that day that i 'm going to bring one of these things back because i know they exist			0
37 years later , i 'm still doing it			1
' quite what mrs @entity45 makes of it all is anyone 's guess , although his son @entity50 has been known to team up with his father and his crack ' a-team ' of @entity2 hunters			1
travelling with @entity50 and @entity10 is @entity55 , described by @entity56 as his ' chief tracker and sharpshooter ' and @entity59 , an elderly survival specialist			1
when @entity56 is n't out hunting for @entity2 , he 's busy making documentaries ; among them @entity62 , @entity2 lives 2 and @entity63			1
it might sound bizarre but @entity10 is convinced he knows what he 's doing			1
' you hear about people saying they 're a @entity2 hunter , @entity2 researcher , @entity2 this and that , crypto zoologist , ' he complains			1
' crypto my ass - the name of the game is this : you either heel and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or you 'll never find anything			0
' 10 : the photographic and video evidence is awful : besides the famed 1968 @entity26 video that purports to show bigfoot walking all footage is grainy and photographs blurred			0
we wonder why ? 9 : @entity2 fails to fit into the food chain in @entity89 : the beast is supposed to be 9ft tall and weigh 600 pounds			2
that would mean it would need to eat 5,000 calories a day to survive - which would lead to a huge unexplained dent in the natural food chain			0
scientists have said they have never detected a gap this size before			0
8 : @entity2 is just too big : logically , a 600 - pound , 9ft tall ape - man would not go unnoticed by people not even on the trail of the @entity2			2
basically , if the creature did exist , we would have found it by now			2
7 : there is no fossil or bone record : a creature this big would have left bones or fossil records behind			2
however , never once have any ape - like creature 's remains or bones been found			2
6 : breeding is impossible : if bigfoot is an ape , it would live a longer lifespan than other mammals in @entity89 and the population would run into the thousands			0
apes are not solitary creatures - unlike how all @entity124 are presented			0
5 : wrongly identified : most experts point out that the majority of @entity2 sightings could simply be black or brown bears walking on their hind - legs			2
4 : explosion in sightings after the @entity132 of 1958 : like @entity133 in 1947 can be seen as year dot for @entity136 sightings , so the discovery of several large footprints in 1958 at @entity139 in @entity140 can be said to have started the @entity2 phenomenon			1
after that there were a spate of sightings which have n't stopped to this day			0
3 : lack of a body : there is a long standing $ 1,000,000 reward for the body of sasquatch			0
2 : hoaxes : but exactly because of the immense financial rewards should a hunter be proved correct , people try to seek fame and fortune with fake @entity124			0
1 : no evidence : if @entity2 exists , all scientists need is one strand of hair to determine through dna that a new ape - like creature has been identified			1
that has not happened .			0

@entity10 from @entity11 has been hunting @entity2 for 37 years
he wants to *float* his @entity13 firm to fund the hunt
@entity10 is hoping to spend $ 113,805 a year looking for the creature
