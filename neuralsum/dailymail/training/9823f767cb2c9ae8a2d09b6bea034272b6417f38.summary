by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 25 july 2013 expensive case : @entity2 , a lawyer with @entity4 firm @entity3 , is embroiled in a costly divorce with his estranged wife @entity6 a millionaire couple who met via an internet dating agency have risked ‘ financial suicide ’ fighting over a divorce , a court heard yesterday			1
lawyer @entity2 and anaesthetist @entity6 have spent more than £ 860,000 on legal fees since separating two years ago			1
a high court judge begged the warring couple to abandon the court battle , which has eroded almost a quarter of their combined wealth			1
mr @entity2 , 41 , who is a partner at the international law firm @entity19 , is a specialist in dispute resolution			1
he owns property in @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24			0
dr @entity6 , 39 , is a paediatric anaesthetist who had worked at @entity25 and had been living in @entity26 , @entity27			1
the court ’s family division heard that the ‘ highly intelligent , successful ’ professionals were married for less than two years , after meeting through an online dating agency in december 2008			0
mr @entity32 said : ‘ they met through an online dating agency when each was in their mid-thirties			1
‘ they were already mature people			0
they were – and are – each highly intelligent , successful professional people			0
‘ they each felt that what they lacked in their lives was a long - term partner or spouse			0
’ the couple married in december 2009 , a year after they met , and had a son another year later			0
but within months of the birth they began having violent arguments , and separated soon afterwards			0
the judge said : ‘ this case is the story of a tragedy ... under two years after a marriage with so much promise , divorce became inevitable			2
’ he said the couple , who are both of @entity59 origin and currently live in @entity60 , have spent a fortune arguing about where their divorce should be heard , even before the proceedings have begun			1
dr @entity6 , who qualified as a doctor in @entity59 in 1996 and trained as an anaesthetist in @entity24 , issued divorce proceedings in @entity24 last april			1
the city has been nicknamed the ‘ divorce capital of the world ’ in legal circles , because its reputation for generous pay - outs for wives mean women are eager to have their divorces heard in @entity74			2
concern : a judge at @entity27 's @entity80 said that he begged the couple to resolve their differences or face possible ' financial suicide ' dr @entity6 has argued that she put her successful career on hold to have the couple ’s son , and should receive compensation from her husband as well as maintenance payments while their son is dependent on her			1
mr @entity2 , who studied at @entity94 and @entity95 , opposed the application			2
the court heard that much of the couple ’s combined wealth was tied up in property he bought before he met dr @entity6			1
however , mr @entity32 ruled that dr @entity6 was entitled to pursue proceedings in @entity24 because both she and her estranged husband had been legally ‘ domiciled ’ in @entity103 during their marriage			1
neither dr @entity6 nor mr @entity2 attended the hearing			1
the judge told the court : ‘ somewhere the husband will have to make fair provision for the wife			2
’ he said he had begged the couple to drop the costly legal fight about where their divorce should be decided during an earlier hearing in may this year			2
‘ each has spent a staggering sum of about £ 430,000 on worldwide legal costs , a combined total of over £ 860,000			2
‘ i begged these parties to resolve their differences			2
i referred to financial suicide			0
‘ the sustained forensic struggle throughout the hearing was painful to observe			0
’ he added : ‘ these parties are successful and prosperous but they are not multi-millionaires			0
their total combined wealth is around £ 4million			0
they have therefore spent just under a quarter of that wealth on highly - charged litigation			0
’ no date has yet been set for the actual divorce proceedings .			0

@entity2 and @entity6 have each spent £ 430,000 on their divorce
high court judge mr @entity32 ' begged couple to resolve differences '
mr @entity2 and dr @entity6 are of @entity59 origin and both live in @entity60
but they are pursuing a divorce in the @entity74 as they were ' domiciled ' here
