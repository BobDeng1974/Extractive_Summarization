mr @entity161 , 29 , was rushed back to @entity166 's @entity165 for life - saving care in this high level isolation apparatus @entity9 is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood , sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease what is @entity9 ? @entity9 is a viral illness			1
initial symptoms can include a sudden fever , intense weakness , muscle pain and a sore throat , according to the @entity151 ( @entity151 )			0

@entity230 does it spread ? it spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood , bodily fluids or organs , or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments			0
when are people contagious ? @entity9 is n't contagious until symptoms appear			1
the incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - is two to 21 days			1
is there a vaccine ? there is no licensed vaccine for @entity9 available			2
this month scientists said they may have developed an effective vaccine for the ebola virus after an experimental immunisation gave monkeys long - term protection from the deadly disease			1
when did it first emerge ? @entity9 first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks , in @entity258 , @entity259 , and in @entity260 , @entity261			1
the latter was in a village situated near the @entity264 , from which the disease takes its name			0
@entity230 was it introduced to humans ? in @entity40 , infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees , gorillas , fruit bats , monkeys and forest antelope			2
the current epidemic is the largest @entity9 outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people a pair of experimental @entity9 vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging @entity40 have been developed			1
the vaccine is effective for at least five weeks in lab monkeys but requires boosting with an additional vaccine to extend its protection to 10 months , according to a new study			0
a pair of experimental @entity9 vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging @entity40 have been developed the findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the @entity9 vaccines in development will prove effective , and in what form			1
pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide @entity9 vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the virus tears through @entity40 , killing more than 2,000 people			1
the results of the new study suggest , for instance , that a vaccine by pharma giant @entity304 ( @entity304 ) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect against @entity9 infection in the short term , but may have to be augmented for long - term protection			2
the study , published in @entity310 , is the first to report that a vaccine regimen produced ' durable immunity ' against @entity9 , protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 months			2
' he 's had a little chicken soup ' : wife of @entity318 missionary with @entity9 says he is showing signs of improvement since arriving for treatment in @entity322			2
the vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus , closely related to a human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections , into which scientists spliced an @entity9 gene			2
the adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal , causing them to take up the gene and produce @entity9 proteins			2
that primes the immune system to attack the proteins of @entity9 viruses when an infection occurs .			2

@entity3 revealed the blood tests had a *negative* result
27 - year - old man was rushed to @entity7 this morning after complaining he felt sick
paramedics suited up in protective gear after identifying the patient had ' symptoms of ebola virus '
