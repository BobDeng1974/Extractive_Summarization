@entity0 have been coming to terms with the ‘ big loss ’ of @entity3 for their entire @entity5 campaign and bracing themselves for further upheaval , with @entity7 destined to be ruled out of the opener , at least			1
the @entity9 confirmed on tuesday that the most experienced fly - half in the squad had sustained a ‘ high - grade ’ medial ligament strain in his left knee during @entity18 ’ @entity17 defeat at @entity19 and would miss the championship campaign			1
that bleak bulletin was accompanied by updates on the state of other frontline casualties , including his clubmate @entity7 , who was on course to start at inside centre against @entity29 in @entity30 a week on friday			1
@entity3 and @entity7 are set to miss @entity0 opening @entity5 owing to injury @entity3 ( far left ) suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from @entity19 's @entity35 instead , the man whose bloody , selfless heroism underpinned the victory over @entity39 at the end of november is almost certain to be counted out of that explosive fixture at the @entity42 , having also strained a knee ligament in @entity44 on sunday			1
the upshot is that @entity0 find themselves with an alarming dearth of fit and firing centres as they prepare to face an onslaught from the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
@entity52 has already all but counted himself out of the whole tournament because of his persisting groin injury , while @entity55 suffered concussion during @entity58 ’s loss to @entity59 on saturday and will be monitored for the remainder of this week			2
his hopes of being available to play in @entity30 are in the balance			0
meanwhile , @entity64 ’s @entity63 went off with another ‘ stinger ’ blow to his left shoulder — his second in successive matches — early in the @entity70 ’s win over @entity71 , so he is also in doubt			0
the @entity0 management have been assailed by bad news and uncertainty at just the wrong time			1
@entity78 ’s broken leg has robbed them of the leading performer in the autumn series , while leading locks @entity82 and @entity84 are both absent — the latter for the whole championship			0
there have been further disruptions to the pack , with @entity90 nursing a sprained ankle and @entity92 ruled out with a knee injury			1
@entity7 walks away during his return to club side saracens last weekend in a 33 - 10 victory over @entity97 after having a scan , @entity90 tweeted on tuesday night : ‘ aside from the obvious bruising / swelling , the scan revealed some potential issues			1
i ’m not ruling myself out just yet			0
’ in total , 12 @entity0 players who would be considered for selection are likely to be unavailable , but the biggest concerns , without question , are in midfield			2
at present , @entity0 have only two fully - fit centres — @entity109 and @entity110			1
they may have to settle for a selection that ignores form , with fitness being the deciding factor			0
@entity55 has been outstanding for @entity58 this season , but he has had a dip in recent weeks			0
@entity109 , meanwhile , has been unconvincing for @entity118 , with frequent lapses in concentration and execution undermining his undoubted all - round class			2
whatever the misgivings , there is every chance that the combination , which featured in all five games in last year ’s tournament , will be reunited next week			0
the loss of @entity3 is of symbolic concern for @entity0 as he is an established leader in the squad whose mental strength and goal - kicking quality make him a reassuring presence when the fur is flying			1
he would have been the replacement fly - half in @entity30 , deputising for @entity138 , but instead that role will be a two - way tussle			2
@entity0 head coach @entity141 is having to contend with a host of injury headaches unless @entity141 chooses not to put a specialist no 10 on the bench , which is unlikely but not unthinkable , @entity144 and @entity145 will go head to head to claim that place			1
the exploits of @entity145 since joining @entity151 were acclaimed yesterday by @entity152 , the recalled @entity153 8 , who played with him when the newcomer ran @entity156 ragged at @entity157			0
‘ one of the most enjoyable games i played with @entity0 was with him at 10 versus @entity156 in 2008 , ’ said @entity152			2
‘ he suffered a bad ankle injury after his golden year , but he has knuckled down			2
he looks to me to be more of a complete player now , with less of the showman stuff that he had in him			0
now it ’s more about , “ right , how do we get over the gain - line and get into good positions ? ” ’ @entity170 acknowledged @entity3 ’s absence would be keenly felt , saying : ‘ he is one of the key leaders ; a driving force of the attack and the gameplan			1
he has clearly proved his status on the international stage and will be a big loss			0
’ however , @entity170 is convinced @entity0 can cope with the injuries which have drastically undermined their preparations , adding : ‘ the strength in depth in rugby in this country is fantastic			1
we ’re equipped to deal with that			0
’ @entity170 has profited from the broken leg suffered by @entity78 to end his three - and - a - half year international exile			2
@entity188 is higher in the @entity190 pecking order but @entity170 said : ‘ the intensity and training will step up over the next week and that ’s a chance for me to show what i ’m about			0
but i do n’t want to be holding tackle bags			0
i want to get selected and show what i can do in a white shirt again .			0

@entity0 's @entity200 account confirmed that @entity3 is set to miss the entire @entity5 campaign through injury
it is expected that @entity18 team - mate @entity7 will also miss the @entity5 opener against @entity29 on *february* 6 because of injury
@entity3 and @entity7 both picked up knee injuries in their club 's @entity17 defeat against @entity19 in @entity44
