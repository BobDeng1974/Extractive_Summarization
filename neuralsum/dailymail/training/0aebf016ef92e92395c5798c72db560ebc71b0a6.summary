these chilling images of a young @entity2 girl at @entity3 are among thousands that have haunted a @entity7 photographer all his life			1
@entity9 was forced to take photographs of frightened children and victims of gruesome medical experiments moments from their death at the extermination camp where some 1.5million people , mostly @entity2 died in the @entity17			1
mr @entity9 , who died this week aged 94 , has had relive those horrors from inside @entity3 but is considered a hero after he risked his life to preserve the harrowing photographs , which later helped convict the very @entity7 monsters who commissioned the photographs			1
frightened victims : @entity9 took some 40,000 - 50,000 photographs inside @entity3 for the @entity26 including these shots of @entity28 after she was beaten by a guard haunting : the identity photographs of an @entity3 inmate that @entity9 took as part of the @entity7 @entity35 effort to document their activities at the camp @entity40 truth : @entity41 inmate @entity9 was among many put to work capturing such images distressing : @entity9 was given the job of taking pictures for the @entity26 because he had been a professional photographer before the war after the war , mr @entity9 tried to return to photography but it was too traumatic			1
he said : ‘ when i started taking pictures again , i saw the dead			1
i would be standing taking a photograph of a young girl for her portrait but behind her i would see them like ghosts standing there			1
' i saw all those big eyes , terrified , staring at me			1
i could not go on			1
’ he never again picked up a camera			1
instead , he set up a business making sausage casings and lived a modestly prosperous life			2
before the war , mr @entity9 trained as a portrait photographer in a studio owned by his aunt in the @entity41 town of @entity68			1
he had an eye for the telling image and an ability to put his subjects at ease			2
but his peaceful , prosperous existence was shattered with the @entity7 invasion of @entity41 in september 1939			2
he was the son of a @entity35 father and @entity41 mother			2
too traumatic : mr @entity9 never picked up a camera again after the war because when he picked up a camera he ' saw the dead ' he said : ‘ when the @entity35 came , they wanted me to join them and say i was loyal to the @entity82 , but i refused			1
i felt @entity41 and i was @entity41			2
it was my mother who instilled this in us			2
’ considering the @entity26 ’ capacity for brutality , it was an extraordinarily brave thing for 22 - year - old mr @entity9 to do			1
after several @entity92 interrogations he tried to flee to @entity93 but was caught at the border			2
he was imprisoned for four months and then offered another chance to declare his loyalty to @entity97			2
he said : ‘ they wanted me to join the @entity35 army and promised everything would be ok for me if i did			2
’ but again he refused and on august 31 , 1940 he was placed on a train for the newly opened concentration camp at @entity3			1
in february 1941 , he was summoned to the camp commander ’s office , the notoriously brutal @entity105 , who would later be hanged for his crimes			2
mr @entity9 was certain that this was the end but when he arrived he discovered that the @entity109 was looking for photographers			1
there followed what must have been a bizarre and terrifying experience			0
the assembled men were tested on their photographic skills			0
each must have known failure would mean a return to hard labour and death			0
he said : ‘ we were five people			0
they went through everything with us - the laboratory skills and the technical ability with a camera			0
i had the skills as well as being able to speak @entity35 , so i was chosen			0
’ the @entity26 wanted documentation of their prisoners			1
the @entity82 was obsessed with bureaucratic records and setup ‘ @entity130 , ’ the photographic identification unit			0
based in the camp , it included cameramen , darkroom technicians and designers			0
@entity3 bound : mr @entity9 became the @entity7 's photographer after being sent to the camp as a prisoner			1
he managed to hide thousands of negatives which were later used as evidence against the nazis who commissioned them extermination : some 1.5million people , mostly @entity2 , were killed at @entity3 during @entity146 he said : ‘ the conditions for me were so much better then			1
the food and warmth were heavenly			0
’ soon began a daily parade of the doomed in this makeshift photographic studio			0
each day he took so many pictures that another team of prisoners was assembled to develop the pictures			0
the photographer estimates that he personally must have taken between 40,000 and 50,000 portraits			1
one day , a prisoner was sent to him because one of the camp doctors , the infamous @entity7 dr @entity160 , wanted a photograph of the man ’s unusual tattoo			0
he said : ‘ it was quite beautiful			0
it was a tattoo of @entity167 standing before the tree in the @entity169 , and it had obviously been done by a skilled artist			0
’ about an hour after taking the photograph , he learned that the man had been killed			0
he was called by another prisoner to come to one of the camp crematoria where he saw the dead man had been skinned			0
family moment : @entity9 took this photo of @entity180 resistance fighter @entity179 with his wife and son jailer : @entity109 officer @entity184 was also captured on film by prisoner @entity9 in the photography department at @entity3 mr @entity9 said : ‘ the skin with the tattoo was stretched on a table waiting to be framed for this doctor			1
it was a horrible , horrible sight			0
’ ‘ @entity160 liked my photographs and said he wanted me to photograph some of those he was experimenting on			0
‘ the first group were @entity2 girls			0
they were ordered to strip naked			0
they were aged 15 to 17 years and were looked after by these two @entity41 nurses			1
' they were very shy and frightened because there were men watching them			0
i tried my best to calm them			0
’ mr @entity9 and another inmate managed to bury thousands of negatives in the camp 's grounds which were later recovered .			1

photographer @entity9 died this week aged 94
he had taken up to 50,000 photos in @entity3 for the @entity26
mr @entity9 hid negatives which were used to convict the very @entity26 who commissioned them
