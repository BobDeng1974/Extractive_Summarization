they seem friendly enough when they ’re discussing the creations of the @entity3 contestants			1
when it comes to @entity8 ’s cooking , however , @entity5 is prepared to ditch the sweet talk			1
speaking ahead of the final of the @entity13 show tonight , the master baker declared he would beat his co-judge ‘ hands down ’ if they were to go head - to - head in a baking competition			1
master baker : @entity5 has said he thinks he would beat @entity8 ' hands down ' in a bake off earlier this year miss @entity8 , 79 , was asked who would win in a bake off – but gave a much more diplomatic answer			1
‘ he ’d win the bread , hands down , but i ’d win the cakes , ’ she told @entity26 magazine			0
but @entity30 , 48 , did not admit to any weakness in either specialism			2
in the magazine ’s latest issue , he said : ‘ i ’d beat @entity8 hands down			1
’ firm friends : the baking experts remain chummy off camera after meeting on the first season of @entity3 off in 2010 if you want to stay trim and healthy look to @entity8 , according to an obesity expert			1
the @entity3 judge famously allows herself cake – but only a sliver			2
and a leading nutrition expert has recommended that this is the best way to stop us craving fatty foods and overindulging later			0
miss @entity8 , 79 , has previously revealed how she is very ‘ disciplined ’ with her portion sizes and has only a small piece of cake when sampling the bakes for the @entity13 contest			1
the best - selling cookery writer also said she used to be ‘ large ’ but felt obliged to stay in shape in case the public looked at her and thought ‘ that ’s what happens when you eat a lot of cake ’			0
professor @entity67 , an expert in nutrition at @entity69 , said : ‘ i like @entity8 , she bakes cakes with everything that you think is awful ; sugar , fats , cream , but she says , “ i only eat a bit of it ”			1
that ’s the key to it			0
’ he also called on shops to ban the ‘ walk of shame ’ whereby they place chocolate bars next to the till to tempt customers queuing			0
‘ people are having food pushed on to them , ’ he said			0
‘ we have people who are susceptible and ca n’t say no. ‘ this business of being offered bars of chocolate when you buy a newspaper			0
i think it is part of the problem			0
’ since the tv cooks shot to fame when the show started four years ago , both @entity30 and miss @entity8 have developed a firm off - screen friendship			1
he often stays at her flat in @entity102 , and once said she ‘ looks after me like i ’m one of her family ’			2
for her part , miss @entity8 has said she is full of respect for @entity30 ’s professional skills , despite the fact she has decades more experience than him			1
she once said : ‘ we respect each other			0
i would never argue with him over a loaf of something because he knows the science of it – how they ’ve achieved it and everything			0
’ just who would be victorious in a baking battle is unclear			0
after joining the family baking business at 18 , @entity30 went on to work as head baker for exclusive hotels including @entity126 and the @entity127			1
and he famously created an @entity130 and @entity131 sourdough bread that was sold for £ 15 a loaf at @entity133			0
meanwhile miss @entity8 trained at the @entity135 cookery school in @entity136 before embarking on a career as a food writer in the 1960s			2
today she has more than 70 books to her name , compared to @entity30 ’s five , which has helped her make an estimated fortune of £ 5million .			2

@entity30 thinks he can beat @entity145 , he announced ahead of final
@entity8 however thinks she is better at baking cakes than @entity5
@entity5 also revealed @entity8 often stays at his flat and *treats* him like family
