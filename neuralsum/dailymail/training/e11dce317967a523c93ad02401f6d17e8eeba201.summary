he was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who , having seen what had happened , postponed pulling their own cords and instead dived towards mr @entity5 , grabbing hold of him and deploying his parachute			1
these pictures , taken on mr @entity5 's head - camera , show the other divers making signs to check he is ok before realising he is not and taking the action that saved his life			1
moment of realisation : this picture , also from mr @entity5 's head - cam , shows his colleagues realising he is not ok with the unconscious mr @entity5 's blue gloved - hand in the foreground , this picture shows the others ' concern mr @entity5 only regained consciousness as he drifted safely down to the ground , where he landed safely and with no memory of what had happened			1
he said : ' i 've been skydiving for five years and this was my 1,050th jump			2
there were 12 people in this skydive , with others leaving the plane just after we jump off			2
' one of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin			0
' they were falling faster than i was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force , knocking me out			2
' he went on : ' i am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realised something was wrong			0
' they chased after me and fortunately i roll into a more stable position - still quickly drifting in the sky			0
mr @entity5 regained consciousness as he floated down , with no memory of the accident ' at first the other skydivers give basic hand signals that we teach our students to correct their body position and find i am still not responding			1
' they manage to get hold of me to try and stop my body tumbling again as we get closer to the altitude where , as a group we separate to deploy our parachutes			0
' they signal to the other jumpers to get away as they were unaware of what was happening			0
they then deploy my main parachute			0
once i was clear they deployed their own			0
' it was nâ€™t until mr @entity5 was under the canopy that he began to regain consciousness , and he landed safely on the ground with no memory of the drama that had unfolded seconds earlier			1
he was taken to hospital where he was treated for an injury to his head , and then given the all - clear and discharged			2
now he says the accident , which happened last july , ' has not put me off at all			0
' mr @entity5 added : ' i am very glad that everything unfolded how it did			1
' this is not something you are taught to do or practise for as it is very uncommon			0
i think my mum and girlfriend are more relieved than i am			0
' help arrives : this head - cam shot shows one of mr @entity5 's friends grab his arm to steady him before pulling the cord with his body now stabilised in the air , another skydiver on mr @entity5 's right goes to pull the parachute cord coming in to land : the head - cam shows @entity131 and the landing zone as mr @entity5 drifts down safely down : this picture shows the grass where mr @entity5 landed , without any idea of what had just happened mr @entity5 , shown here on another jump , is an experienced skydiver who has completed more than 1,000 jumps			1
