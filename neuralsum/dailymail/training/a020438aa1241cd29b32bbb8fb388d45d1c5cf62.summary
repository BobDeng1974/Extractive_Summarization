@entity1 's stars may have had a difficult week , but they looked focused and ready to put it behind them as they arrived at @entity4 on tuesday			1
a thrashing at the hands of @entity8 champions @entity7 last wednesday was followed up with a dour draw at home to @entity11			0
but @entity1 will be hopeful that they can get back to winning ways in the @entity13 against a @entity15 side who have won just one of their last four games			2
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 look focussed on the task ahead as they get off the team bus @entity1 keeper @entity25 has come under fire this season , but could start in a strong team on tuesday and the likes of @entity20 and @entity21 looked to have their game faces on as they arrived at @entity4 ahead of tuesday 's game			2
@entity33 , who managed his opposite number @entity34 at @entity15 when @entity34 was a player there , is likely to name a strong side for the game			0
however it is still not clear whether @entity40 , who missed his side 's best chance on the weekend and has been widely criticised , will play			0
@entity43 looks in a hurry while @entity45 has time to wave ahead of the @entity13 clash @entity47 , who has played in each of @entity1 's last three games , arrives at @entity4 on tuesday @entity40 could continue up front for @entity1 despite his poor form in recent games for @entity1 @entity34 ( left ) played under @entity1 manager @entity33 ( right ) when he was a @entity15 players			1

@entity1 face @entity15 in fourth round of the @entity13
@entity1 lost to @entity7 last week , and drew with @entity11 on *saturday*
