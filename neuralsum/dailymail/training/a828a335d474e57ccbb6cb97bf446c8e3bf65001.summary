by @entity0 secretary of state for communities and local government @entity1 mp has granted 17 appeals rural towns and villages are being placed under siege by the threat of 700,000 new homes in the countryside , according to a hard - hitting report			1
almost 200,000 of these are earmarked for supposedly protected @entity14 land thanks to the government 's changes to planning laws , the @entity11 warns today			1
its report reveals that just 84 local authorities – a quarter of those outside @entity20 – propose to prioritise building on brownfield sites			1
a study of planning decisions also shows that 39 major housing developments in the year to march 2013 , totalling 8,700 new houses on greenfield land , were given the green light after an appeal by developers – double the number the year before			1
some 17 appeals were granted personally by communities secretary @entity1			1
in another 14 cases councils simply abandoned their objections because they feared losing on appeal			0
the @entity11 claims that the overall proportion of major appeals granted has risen to 46 per cent , up from 31.7 per cent in 2008 - 09			1
the report has been written to coincide with the second anniversary this week of the @entity40 's @entity39 , which established a presumption in favour of ' sustainable development ' to kickstart house building			0
but a third of all councils still do not have a local plan for development in place			2
these are supposed to give more power to residents and town hall chiefs to resist unwanted development			0
the @entity11 says the changes have led to an ' unnecessary loss of countryside ' and have left some towns and villages facing the prospect of changing out of all recognition			2
at @entity64 in @entity65 , proposals for 340 new homes are expected to double the size of the village			0
at @entity69 in @entity70 , 1,365 homes are to be built in a town of just 3,573 houses – expected to lead to a population increase of up to 92 per cent			0
the report says : ' the most recent government figures state that there is enough suitable brownfield land available for 1,500,000 new houses			2
emerging and adopted local plans are , however , proposing significant amounts of building on greenfield land			1
( @entity84 picture ) @entity14 land in @entity86			2
the @entity11 says the changes have led to an ' unnecessary loss of countryside ' ' we estimate that land has been allocated for 729,000 new houses , of which 190,000 are in the @entity14			1
these sites are often on the edge of country towns and villages			0
' it adds : ' many of these “ villages under siege ” are faced with planning applications proposing development well in excess of the amount envisaged in emerging or adopted @entity104			0
' @entity105 , chief executive of the @entity11 , said the report provided ' firm evidence ' that the government 's planning reforms were not achieving their stated aims			2
he added : ' far from community control of local development , we are seeing councils under pressure to disregard local democracy to meet top - down targets			0
' local authorities are having to agree fanciful housing numbers and allocate huge areas of greenfield land to meet them			1
where they lack an up - to - date plan , the countryside is up for grabs and many villages feel under siege from developers			0
' planning minister @entity130 said the report was ' inaccurate , exaggerated and based on a spurious analysis of the facts ' , adding : ' we have given councils the power to shape where the new homes our country needs should and should n't go			0
