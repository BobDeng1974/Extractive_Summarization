embattled cabinet minister @entity0 today insisted she will pay capital gains tax on the sale of the £ 1.4million house part - funded by the taxpayer			1
the @entity5 faced fresh questions about her finances as it emerged she stopped claiming expenses on the south @entity11 home just as parliamentary officials were demanding mps sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax incurred on future sales			1
mrs @entity0 bought the house almost 20 years ago , claimed expenses on it for four years and sold it for a profit of more than £ 1million in february this year			1
culture secretary @entity0 has vowed to pay capital gains tax on her house sale as the row over he expenses refuses to go away mrs @entity0 ’s position in the @entity26 has become increasingly precarious after she was forced to apologise to the @entity27 and pay back £ 5,800			1
@entity28 has refused to sack her , despite a poll showing 78 per cent of people think mrs @entity0 should be fired			0
last week the independent standards commissioner @entity31 said mrs @entity0 had overclaimed for expenses on her mortgage by £ 45,000			2
but in a dispute about the rules at the time , miss @entity31 was overruled by mps on the @entity38 which said she need repay only £ 5,800			1
mrs @entity0 caused further outrage with a 32 - second apology to the comments , after she was criticised for her attitude to the year - long inquiry into her claims			2
1996 : bought double - fronted @entity46 terrace house in @entity47 , south - west @entity11 , for £ 234,000 2005 : elected @entity49 mp for @entity50 2005 - 2009 : claimed £ 90,718 in expenses on the property 2007 : increased the mortgage for a second time to £ 575,000 , with taxpayers meeting the cost 2009 april : stopped claiming expenses 2009 may : commons officials wrote to mps demanding they sign a declaration agreeing to pay capital gains tax on second homes 2010 : became minister for disabled people 2011 : started claiming expenses on renting a property in her @entity50 constituency 2012 : joined @entity26 as @entity5 2014 : sold @entity11 home for £ 1.47million , a profit of £ 1.236million when the expenses scandal broke in 2009 , several mps were accused of ‘ flipping ’ the declaration of their second home in order to avoid capital gains tax			1
sales of a main home do not carry capital gains tax , but it is levied at 28 per cent on profits made on second homes			1
it was legal for mps to declare one property as a second home for expenses , but as a main home for tax purposes			2
in may 2009 @entity89 officials wrote to mps asking them to sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax due			1
but weeks before mrs @entity0 instead stopped claiming for any expenses on the @entity47 property she shared with her parents			2
she later designated the @entity11 house as her main home and from 2011 claimed expenses on a property in her @entity50 constituency			1
a spokesman for the @entity5 said : ‘ this is nonsense			0
it is well documented that @entity0 stopped claiming any accommodation allowance at all in april 2009			0
the sale of the @entity47 property in february , falls in a tax year that has not yet been assessed			1
she will of course deal with the matter in accordance with @entity111 rules and pay any tax that is due			2
' aides deny @entity114 ‘ flipped ’ her designation in order to avoid capital gains tax , noting that she stopped claiming expenses on the @entity11 house five years ago			1
however , the row has reignited public anger over the expenses scandal and fuelled calls for her to be sacked			2
former conservative chairman @entity123 became the most senior conservative to call for her to go , writing on the @entity127 website that her ‘ arrogant ’ handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over @entity90 ' expenses and adding : ‘ the best way out of this is for @entity114 to resign			0
’ a poll by @entity135 for the @entity136 found that large majorities of voters believe she should forfeit her @entity26 post ( 78 per cent ) or be sacked as mp for @entity50 ( 68 per cent )			0
this is the house in @entity47 , south @entity11 , which @entity114 owned for 19 years , claiming expenses to pay the mortgage for four years , before selling it for £ 1.4million dream home : this is @entity0 's new £ 1.2million converted @entity148 barn in @entity149 , bought after selling her family home in @entity47 for £ 1.4million mrs @entity0 's husband @entity152 was seen outside the couple 's home in @entity155 , @entity149 today , but there was no sign of the minister expenses watchdog sir @entity159 , chair of the @entity161 , said it was time for mps to stop ‘ marking their own homework ’ and give ms @entity31 the final say in standards investigations			1
and @entity169 's shadow leader of the @entity170 promised a shake - up if the party wins next year 's election : ‘ we need a system which commands public confidence , and what we have at the moment clearly does n't do that			0
prime minister @entity28 had vowed to stand by @entity114 and refused to sack her but his judgment was came into question from other @entity181 ‘ we need reform so that people have faith that mps are properly held to account			0
@entity28 has failed to act but @entity169 wo n't let this failing system go unreformed			0
’ but @entity38 member @entity187 warned that handing the right to sanction mps to an external regulator could raise constitutional issues , as the watchdog could have the power to change the shape of a government - particularly in times of a narrow majority - by handing down a lengthy suspension or even expulsion from the @entity27			2
mr @entity187 told @entity201 's @entity200 : ‘ anybody who has the power to expel a member of parliament from the @entity204 has an enormous power to alter governments , to change the shape of political history			0
‘ i think what the critics of the current system have to answer is if external regulation is going to be introduced , who is to do it , and to whom is that person or regulator to be accountable ? ’ while mps are accountable to the electorate through the ballot box , in the case of an independent regulator ‘ the only conceivable possibility would be to hand it to a court ’ , said mr @entity187			0
‘ that would involve real problems , constitutional problems , of the separation of powers			0
i 'm not at all sure the judiciary would want to have the powers , ’ he said			0
and the @entity234 mp added : ‘ nowhere in the world - certainly in no major democracy - has there been complete external regulation			0
