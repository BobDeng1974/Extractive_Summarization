@entity0 , 44 , the married vice principal of @entity14 , is accused of having a sexual relationship with a former pupil			1
but today jurors at his trial were told the girl , now aged 19 , is a ' psychopathic liar ' who thought ' everyone fancies her			1
' the woman , who can not be identified for legal reasons , claims that during her relationship with @entity0 , which began when she was 15 , the pair had sex ' all over ' the school			1
she told jurors that @entity0 took her virginity in one of the store cupboards , and claimed he had once taken her for a day - long sex session at his home while his wife at work			1
but at the @entity38 today , @entity0 argued that the girl had stalked him , and used details gleaned from calendars , computers and gadgets in his office to construct her fantasy			1
@entity0 's defence barrister @entity46 said : ' he 's a man who did n't look behind his back , and he was stalked , and information was found out about him for this carefully constructed elaborate ruse			2
' why ? we do n't know , it 's not up to the defence to prove			0
' @entity53 , a librarian at the school , also gave evidence to support @entity0 's account , calling the girl a liar , and saying that she used to take @entity0 's @entity59 to play games on			1
in court today @entity0 also denied buying a @entity62 keychain - based on the erotic novel - for the female student , saying it was a ' joke present for his wife instead			1
he also denied carrying condoms in his suit jacket at the school , saying his wife would have noticed as she often hung up his jacket and removed things from the pockets			0
the court had previously heard that the girl had lied about being in a car accident to skip school			2
mr @entity46 added : ' this particular lie , of the accident , was so elaborate it fooled people for weeks , even her friends did n't know about it , even her mum did n't know about it			0
' it 's not pleasant to talk about [ the girl ] in terms of being a liar , but the issue really is a credibility point			0
' the alleged victim , who can not be identified , said @entity0 took her virginity in school cupboard when she was 16 , after which they had sex ' all over ' @entity14 where he was vice principal the girl claims that her relationship with @entity0 began when she was 15 - years - old after they became close , spending time in the school library where she had volunteered since year 9			1
according to prosecutors the girl 's intimate knowledge of @entity0 's private life , including birthdays and the fact he always wore a crucifix under his work attire , point to th truth of her claims			2
however defence barristers argue that the crucifix detail came from a photo of the teacher and his son kept in his office			0
the girl also claimed that , after seeing the teacher undressed , she noticed a scar on his back			0
however , it was argued he told her about the scar when he gave her sympathy following her false claims that she had been injured in a car crash			0
in an interview with police the girl claimed the pair slept with each other in the same week that his wife , @entity132 , suffered a miscarriage in late 2012			0
mr @entity46 said his client knew nothing of the allegations against him until the police interviewed him			0

he has nothing to hide , nothing at all			0
