@entity0 will be keen to avoid a third defeat on the spin when they take on rivals @entity3 in sunday ’s crunch derby after floundering in recent weeks without banned striker @entity5			1
it is @entity7 ’s side who are struggling at the foot of the @entity11 table – sitting perilously one point above the bottom three - but @entity13 can reveal that @entity15 ’s team would be two points adrift of their foes in the relegation zone if it were n’t for @entity5 ’s goals			1
the @entity22 forward is @entity0 ’s top scorer this season with 11 goals , with 10 of those decisive in changing games in the @entity26 ’ favour			1
@entity5 is @entity0 's top scorer this season with 11 goals - 10 of those were decisive 20 september @entity31 ( h ) 2 - 2 ( 2 goals ) 4 october @entity34 ( a ) 2 - 2 ( 2 goals ) 2 december @entity35 ( a ) 1 - 1 ( 1 goal ) 6 december @entity37 ( h ) 2 - 1 ( 2 goals ) 26 december @entity40 ( a ) 1 - 3 ( 1 goal ) 28 december @entity42 ( h ) 3 - 2 ( 1 goal ) 11 february @entity45 ( a ) 1 - 1 ( 1 goal ) 28 february @entity47 ( h ) ( 1 goal ) since his double against @entity31 rescued a 2 - 2 draw in september , @entity5 has earned @entity0 11 points with his goalscoring heroics — almost single - handedly lifting them to mid-table			1
take those goals away and the @entity11 reads somewhat differently			1
@entity0 languish in 18th place on 24 points in the fantasy table behind @entity3 on 26			2
they would have scored just 22 times — the second fewest in the division behind @entity47 — and won only six games			0
six of @entity5 ’s strikes have been against sides in the bottom half and @entity35 , @entity31 , @entity42 , and @entity47 would have leapfrogged a @entity0 side shorn of the striker			2
after his brace against @entity71 ’s side , @entity5 scored another double to clinch a 2 - 2 draw against @entity34 two weeks later			1
his next goal was a second - half equaliser in a 1 - 1 with @entity35 in december and , four days later , hit another two to seal a 2 - 1 victory over @entity37			0
later that month he netted in a 3 - 2 triumph over @entity42 while in february he scored against his former manager @entity78 at @entity45 in a 1 - 1 draw			0
@entity5 also supplied the cutting edge to snatch a 1 - 0 victory against @entity47			2
the @entity83 striker is currently serving a seven - game ban after clashing with @entity85 5 april @entity3 ( a ) 13 april @entity86 ( a ) 19 april @entity87 ( h ) 25 april @entity34 ( h ) 2 may @entity90 ( a ) his only goal which has n’t had affected the outcome of a match was a late consolation penalty in a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity97 on @entity98			1
even when @entity5 has n’t found the net , however , he still has a beneficial impact			2
@entity0 have a points - to - games ratio of 1.37 when the striker plays but just 0.9 when he does n’t			0
in reality , there is little cause for concern as @entity15 ’s side currently sit 10 points clear of the drop zone			0
but after their trip to the @entity112 they will face top - four chasing @entity86 and @entity87 in the coming weeks			0
@entity0 will be hoping they are n’t looking over their shoulders when @entity5 returns for their final three games of the campaign			0
@entity5 nets against @entity35 at @entity116 , a goal that saw @entity0 earn a point in december			0

*newcastle* hope to avoid third defeat in a *row* when they face @entity3
@entity5 has scored 11 @entity11 goals this season
10 of those have been decisive , and the @entity26 would be in the relegation zone behind @entity3 without his goals
