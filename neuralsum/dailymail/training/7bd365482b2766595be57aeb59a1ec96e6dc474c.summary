by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 two days before what would appear to be his inevitable coronation as a @entity6 winner , @entity2 sat behind a desk in a @entity8 at @entity10 ’s training ground and stuck rigidly to a favoured formula			1
‘ it is a normal game , ’ @entity2 said on friday			1
‘ just one more game			2
after the finish on sunday i will tell you what i feel			0
’ friday afternoons with @entity2 never tend to be very exciting			1
rarely , if ever , does he tell anyone what he really feels			0
even his players claim not to know much more than they absolutely need to			2
control : @entity2 looked relaxed during training with @entity10 on the verge of the title preparation : @entity10 face @entity25 at the @entity26 in their final game of the season champions elect : @entity10 need just a point against @entity25 to win their second title in three years the title if @entity25 win at the @entity26 , @entity33 can pip @entity10 by beating @entity34 at @entity35			1
@entity36 @entity37 qualify through the @entity38 and fifth - placed @entity39 are in			0
@entity40 will get the final spotwith a point against @entity43			1
if @entity40 lose , @entity44 can pip them with a win at @entity46			2
is there a bonus place from @entity48 ? no. only the top three nations in @entity51 ’s respect rankings get an extra @entity36 spot			0
@entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 will receive that honour			0
@entity57 @entity58 still have a mathematical chance ofsurvival but need to beat @entity60 and hope @entity61 lose to @entity62 with a 17 - goal swing in the @entity58 ’ favour			0
‘ it ’s hard to really get to know him , ’ said a source close to one of @entity10 ’s @entity68 players this week			1
‘ he ’s just a nice bloke			0
his training is straightforward , nothing amazing			0
but he just gets the job done and lets the players do theirs			2
‘ what is important to them is that he is straight			0
he is approachable and if you ask him a question , you get an answer			0
too many managers bulls * * * * players or , even worse , ignore them			2
you do n’t get that with @entity2			1
you get an answer and — even if it ’s not the answer you want — the players appreciate that			2
’ if friday press conferences and weekday training sessions are nothing to get excited about under @entity2 , saturdays and sundays tend to be different			1
one more point at home to @entity25 tomorrow will bring @entity10 their second title in three seasons			1
the @entity93 club know all about @entity10 ’s power			1
already this season , @entity10 ’s threshing machine has brought them 12 goals in three games against @entity100 ’s team			1
@entity2 ’s football has been expressive , aggressive and relentless			1
it is the way @entity10 football director @entity104 de- manded it to be when @entity2 was hired last summer			1
‘ that was absolutely a prerequisite , ’ said a club source			0
the football flies in the face of @entity2 ’s character and demeanour , though			1
hungry : @entity33 will be ready to pounce should @entity10 slip up on the final day of the season party time : a 4 - 0 win over @entity43 on wednesday put @entity10 on the brink of the title changes : @entity2 has steadied the ship at the @entity26 after a poor last season under @entity121 city should be pleased to see @entity123 in charge			1
in his first @entity6 game @entity10 won 3 - 0 at home , he was in charge when they won the 2011 fa cup final and when they won the @entity129 in march			1
but he allowed @entity130 to score the 96th - minute winner in the @entity133 derby — a 4 - 3 thriller in 2009			0
he claimed he was ‘ a dog ’ as a player and had to completely and deliberately change his character in order to bring about the calm that now personifies him			0
whatever the case , when he arrived at @entity10 last july , @entity2 soon realised he was inheriting a dressing room badly in need of soothing			1
‘ @entity2 was n’t hired because of his calm or because he is a nice man , ’ another club source told @entity145 this week			1
‘ he was hired for his reputation as a coach			0
‘ having said that , he had done his research before he arrived			0
he knew what had happened last season			0
’ it ’s hard to assess @entity2 ’s impact on @entity10 without mentioning his predecessor @entity121			1
the @entity157 was a successful @entity10 coach and popular in some quarters			1
none the less , the dressing room he left behind was fractured and one of @entity2 ’s clearest triumphs has been to apply some glue			1
the end : @entity121 was popular among fans after guiding @entity10 to the title in 2012 but left last season ‘ even the best players could feel like s * * * under @entity121 , ’ said a dressing room source			1
‘ for example , @entity170 signed a new contract at the start of last season and reached the end talking about leaving			0
that was how bad it got			0
even @entity177 got fed up			0
‘ @entity2 put a stop to that			1
he does n’t scapegoat players			2
dressing room b * * * * * * ings are n’t really his style			0
we never really get them now			0
we just go out and play			0
’ if all this sounds too simple , that is because it is			0
however , @entity2 ’s ability to drag something approaching the best from the playing squad built in part by @entity121 has been fundamental to progress and @entity170 hinted at that in an interview he gave in the run - up to sunday ’s game			1
‘ having @entity2 here has helped me personally , ’ said the @entity199 international			1
‘ it ’s been really good for me			0
he ’s made it a happy place and has changed our style of play , too			2
you see that in the way we play , attack minded , lots of goals			0
silverware : @entity2 lifts the @entity129 after @entity10 beat @entity212 in the final at @entity214 rejuvenated : @entity170 is happy with @entity2 's appointment after become disillusioned under @entity121 ‘ his calmness has been obvious and it really helps us at difficult moments			1
it ’s nice to have that calm attitude around you when things get tough			0
’ if good coaches can be identified by an ability to improve players then there is evidence in @entity2 ’s favour			1
players like @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 have taken steps forward this season and even those written off by some supporters — such as @entity237 and @entity238 — are ending the season well			2
that is down to subtle handling , at least in part			0
players left out of the team , meanwhile , have benefited from some honesty			2
one of @entity2 ’s biggest calls was to drop @entity247 for a month in early winter			1
in @entity250 season it could have demoralised the @entity252 goalkeeper			0
‘ @entity247 came back from that a better goalkeeper , ’ revealed a source close to him			0
‘ he was disappointed and hurt but @entity2 explained the reasons honestly and clearly			2
@entity247 had little choice to accept it and deal with because it was all up front			0
’ on arriving at the club , @entity2 soon established a reputation as a measured coach who talked but also listened			2
living in the nearby football enclave of @entity263 , the 60 - year - old plays the occasional round of golf and has now brought his wife @entity266 to join him , something he had never done in a decade working outside @entity268			0
decisions : @entity247 was dropped for a month after a number of mistakes , but has turned his form around shake it off : @entity274 confronts @entity2 during a game against @entity34 in january there have been some hiccups this season			1
defeat by @entity279 in the @entity280 at the @entity26 prompted a rather embarrassing attack on the @entity54 match official			0
‘ within half an hour of that he knew what he ’d said was wrong , ’ said the club source			0
briefly an old adversary , @entity286 , threatened to interrupt progress as @entity288 dismantled @entity10 on their own turf and , just for a few days , @entity2 allowed himself to be pulled towards a public argument with the @entity291			1
@entity2 soon reverted to type , though , and the incident that perhaps best summed up his approach in the rather frenetic , emotional world of the @entity6 came at @entity296 in january when @entity34 manager @entity274 called him a ‘ f * * * * * * old c * * * ’ on the touchline			1
@entity274 subsequently wrote to @entity2 to apologise , something the city manager never publicised			1
it was @entity2 ’s reaction after the game that said most about him , though , when it was explained to him in @entity199 exactly what @entity274 had called him			2
‘ is that all ? ’ @entity2 smiled , with a raised eyebrow			2
‘ i have been called much worse			0
’ @entity25 will have the fate of the @entity6 title in their hands , but can they pull off a shock at the @entity26 ? why they can ... @entity25 have a habit of doing well on the last day of the season			1
in 2006 they denied their sickness - stricken rivals @entity40 a place in the @entity280 with a 2 - 1 home win and in 2007 @entity317 ’s goal at @entity318 ensured the club escaped relegation on the final day			1
@entity10 should beware a sunday roast			2
they have lost six league games this season , and four of those came on a sunday			2
why they ca n't ... @entity25 do not travel well to the blue half of @entity133			2
in their last 25 away games at @entity10 , they have won just twice , drawing three times and losing a whopping 20 games			2
1 - @entity10 have lost just one of their last 13 @entity6 matches against @entity25			1
they have won nine and drawn three			0
city do n’t so much have home advantage as home domination			0
they have won 49 points at home this season , more than any side , and they have a phenomenal goalscoring record at the @entity26			2
12 - 1 - after three games this season , one in the league and two in the @entity129 semifinal , @entity10 are beating @entity25 by an aggregate score of 12 - 1			1
do n’t bet against them extending that score - line on sunday .			0

@entity10 lead @entity33 by two points heading into final day
@entity10 need just a point against @entity25 to win @entity6
@entity33 can win league with win over @entity34 and @entity10 loss
@entity2 has made @entity121 's squad perform well
@entity357 manager is popular among @entity10 's players
