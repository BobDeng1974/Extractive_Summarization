he also dismissed suggestions that there are other ways of tackling the cost of modernising the railways			0
warning : @entity2 told the @entity12 conference that @entity9 opponents are putting the @entity5 at risk in a clear swipe at @entity26 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ to people who say there is some other cost - reduction plan we could also have , i say that is nonsense			1
‘ people who are against it , in my view , are putting our country ’s future at risk , they are putting the future of the @entity5 at risk			1
‘ we need to have a concerted consensus across business , across politics , that we are going to get behind these large infrastructure projects			0
’ the prime minister said he was ‘ passionate ’ about the @entity9 scheme , which will initially link @entity48 with @entity49 before being extended into a y - shaped route that will reach @entity51 and @entity52			1
he added : ‘ we need to build new railway lines in our country			0
we have n’t built a line that is north of @entity48 for 120 years			0

controversial : the @entity9 rail line will initially link @entity48 with @entity49 , before being extended into a y - shaped route that will reach @entity51 and @entity52 ‘ it is going to unite our country , it will help drive economic growth , it will make sure our economy shares growth between the @entity64 , it will link eight of our ten biggest cities			1
’ mr @entity2 also rejected arguments that the cost of @entity9 will divert investment away from other work on the @entity71 ’s transport network			1
he pointed out that planned spending on the project between 2015 and 2020 totals £ 16billion – less than a quarter of the £ 73billion earmarked for improvements to roads and railways			0
attempting to shore up support for the faltering scheme , the prime minister went on to announce that sir @entity81 , the new boss of the planned rail link , had been tasked with finding ways to cut the estimated £ 50billion price of the scheme , drive down costs and ‘ make it affordable for our country ’			2
speech : mr @entity2 also dismissed suggestions that there are other ways of tackling the cost of modernising the railways the former chief executive of the @entity96 , sir @entity2 - who takes over as @entity9 chairman next year - believes the scheme can come in ‘ substantially ’ under current estimates if cuts are made to the £ 14billion contingency costs			1
mr @entity2 told the @entity12 : ‘ i want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this @entity9 investment			1
i think it is fantastic that sir @entity81 - the man who built the @entity108 on time and on budget - is going to be running @entity9			2
‘ i think with sir @entity81 in charge , with the budget we have and the contingency we have , this is a good investment for @entity71			2
’ he added : ‘ one of the first things he is going to do is make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can , so it comes in under the budget that ’s been set			0
‘ there is already a contingency of £ 14billion there			0
i know he will do a good job and make it affordable for our country			0
’ the scheme will need cross-party approval if it is to succeed , but at the same conference , shadow chancellor @entity135 announced that @entity26 was still concerned about spiralling costs			2
he told business leaders that he was not going to be signing a ‘ blank cheque ’ for the plans			0
in his speech , mr @entity135 went on to say : ‘ @entity26 supports @entity9 because of the capacity constraints on the existing rail network			1
‘ but our support for it is not at any cost			0
the @entity26 can not - and will not - give the government a blank cheque			2
building a consensus about long - term infrastructure does not mean turning a blind eye to value for money			0
