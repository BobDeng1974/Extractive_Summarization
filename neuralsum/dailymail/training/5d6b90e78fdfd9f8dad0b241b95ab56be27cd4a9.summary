they will only be allowed to spend a net figure of £ 48.8m ( € 60 ) in the transfer market this summer — meaning @entity33 can generate extra finances by selling players — and the wage bill has been frozen so it remains at the same level as this season			1

of this € 60million an amount of € 40million will be withheld conditionally and will be returned to @entity0 if the club fulfills the operational and financial measures agreed			0
’ @entity0 said they had considered challenging @entity5 ‘ through every avenue of recourse ’ , but decided to compromise safe in the knowledge that they ‘ will be operating without sanction or restriction at the commencement of the 2015 - 16 season ’			0
the club believe that the sanctions will only have a limited impact because they are on course to break even for the financial year ending may 31 , so the issue of losses for over the next two years is not important			0
@entity0 also insisted that the transfer and wage cap ‘ will have no material impact on the club ’s planned transfer activity ’ with several players — including @entity96 and @entity97 — set to leave and thus reduce the wage bill			1
