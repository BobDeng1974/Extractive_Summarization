@entity0 's company : @entity2 and husband @entity3 settle in at @entity4 the @entity5 my husband @entity3 and i knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time			1
our baby girl is due on june 4 and , when we touched down in @entity12 , i was 28 weeks pregnant			1
you ca n't fly after that without a doctor 's note			1
we had left it until the last minute and , by the time we arrived , both of us were ready to relax			2
i 'd been to @entity12 once before as a swimmer , when we stayed in an apartment			1
this was completely different - and utterly amazing			1
the @entity22 is part of @entity25 project and is like nowhere else			2
because it has over-the - water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the @entity31 , but when we went to the @entity33 themed restaurant , i imagined i was back in the jungle on i 'm a celebrity — even though there were n't any luxuries in that jungle			1
you have to see @entity12 to believe it			1
everything is so clean , luxurious and new — even the main tourist areas			2
and everywhere hotels are being built			2
we kept asking ourselves how they will all survive , but somehow they will			2
our room was on the lagoon , which meant we had direct access to the water			1
we tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool , then , after lunch , we retreated to our gorgeous room , where we had sun beds on the balcony			1
@entity3 is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies			1
by 4pm , it gets hazy in @entity12			1
some days we went for a wander around the whole resort , which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out			1
jump in : the @entity22 has three turquoise - blue ' lagoons ' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels we had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby			1
we always wanted to know what to expect — we 're having a girl — because we are both impatient people and are keen to plan ahead , but we ca n't agree on a name			2
naming something before you see it is strange and it 's vital that her first name goes with her last , which will be @entity3 's name , needs			1
we want a name that wo n't sound as if she is ' @entity82 ' , if you see what i mean			2
one day , we went out on a boat and i hoped to see @entity88 's house , but no one seemed sure where it was exactly			1
but what we did see were some of the most expensive properties ever			2
there 's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world			1
we also made a trip to the famous @entity101 , which is bigger than a football stadium — or so it seems			2
and guess what ? we bought our not - born - yet baby her first swimsuit			1
it has a @entity109 look to it , with jaunty stripes			2
my plan is to take her swimming as soon as i can			2
it 's something we will always be able to do together			2
retail therapy : @entity118 did a spot of shopping at the famous ( and enormous ) @entity101 more importantly , i regard swimming as a valuable life skill and i was surprised to see at the hotel that some children had never learned			0
that 's why i 've started @entity125 for three to 11 - year - olds			1
already we have 17 venues taking part and 3,500 children are learning to swim with us			0
there were lots of @entity133 people in the hotel and they were all very friendly			0
it never bothers me if someone wants to come up and have a chat or have a photograph taken			0
athletes are different to film stars in that people see us as we are , not playing a particular role			0
and we are used to having a microphone shoved in our faces immediately after we have competed			0
it teaches you to be natural			0
one thing i enjoyed at the @entity4 was looking at all the baby equipment people have			1
it started to give me ideas			0
i was also pleased to see how kind everyone was to the children			0
the staff went out of their way to be helpful			0
this is a real family resort			2
paradise pictured : the @entity158 offers over-the - water villas which provide the perfect sea view after i retired from competitive swimming at the age of 23 , i did n't go near a pool for six months			1
then i started to swim again as a way to keep fit and i still love it			0
i love the feeling of being weightless and this is especially welcome when you 're pregnant			0
@entity3 and i went to the gym a few times at the hotel and i did a bit of this and that , but i am not used to high - impact sport			1
a gym is difficult on my knees			0
there is not the tiniest bit of me that ever wants to compete again			0
as an athlete , i was so focused and driven and i left the sport knowing that i could not have given more of myself			0
all that training was really tough , but i chose to do it			0
flashback : @entity2 survived daunting trials when she appeared on i 'm a celebrity ... in 2013 now , i have a chance to get on with the rest of my life and i 'm excited about that , too			0
it gives me an opportunity to try new things — like coming to @entity12 with @entity3 and spending most of the time lying around			1
in the @entity33 restaurant , an @entity195 man came up to me and said he recognised me			0
' you 'll feel at home in this restaurant , then ? ' he said			0
' why ? ' i said			0
' i 'm not @entity33			0
' ' because you were on that programme in the jungle , ' he said , without mentioning my swimming			0
i am so pleased to have done i 'm a celebrity			0
it helped me find my feet and i 've always loved @entity207 and dec. but it was scary not knowing what would happen and suddenly finding myself with 11 strangers			0
what 's for sure is that it really made me appreciate a holiday like the one in @entity12			1
@entity214 ( 0333 7000 747 , www.jasmineholidays.co.uk ) offers seven nights ' stay at the @entity217 , @entity22 on a half - board basis - from £ 1,150 per person , based on two adults sharing , including flights and transfers			1
