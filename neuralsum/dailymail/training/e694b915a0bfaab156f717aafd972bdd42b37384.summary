@entity1 's world tour took another embarrassing turn on tuesday when a top aide told reporters at a @entity6 holy site to ' kiss my a * * ' and ' shove it ' when they shouted questions at the @entity10 presidential candidate			1
@entity11 , @entity1 's traveling press secretary , flew off the handle at the @entity13 in @entity14 and was forced to apologize -- marking the third - straight country where sideshow remarks have distracted from intent of the resume - boosting international trip			1
in @entity19 last week , @entity1 was jeered by politicians and booed by crowds after he suggested the city was n't ready to for the @entity23			1
' his campaign has vehemently denied those allegations			0
mr @entity11 's remarks came hours before a major foreign policy speech in the @entity6 capital in which @entity1 praised the central @entity46 nation for becoming what he said was a model of small government and free enterprise			1
the former @entity52 governor said that ' rather than heeding the false promise of a government - dominated economy , @entity6 sought to stimulate innovation , attract investment , expand trade and live within its means ' after the @entity61 era			2
' the world should pay close attention to the transformation of @entity6 â€™s economy , ' @entity1 said			2
' a march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards , a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad , and an important and growing role on the international stage			0
' mr @entity11 's angry words to reporters were made tuesday morning when @entity1 visited a monument to @entity6 's war dead with the @entity14 mayor			2
reporters began shouting questions at the presumptive @entity10 nominee from behind a rope line because , they said , he has answered only three queries from the traveling press corps			0
a @entity88 reporter shouted : ' @entity89 are you concerned about some of the mishaps of your trip ? ' ' @entity89 do you have a statement for the @entity37 ? ' a @entity97 reporter @entity95 about your gaffes ? ' chimed in a @entity100 writer			2
' governor @entity1 do you feel that your gaffes have overshadowed your foreign trip ? ' asked the @entity97 journalist			1
honoring the dead : @entity1 laid a wreath at the @entity105 before visiting with the mayor of @entity14 praise : @entity1 said @entity6 was a model for small government and free enterprise during a foreign policy speech at the @entity112 ' governor @entity1 just a few questions sir , you have n't taken but three questions on this trip from the press ! ' the @entity88 reporter protested			1
that 's when mr @entity11 stepped in : ' show some respect , ' he told the @entity121 journalists			0
when a @entity97 reporter said he was trying to get answers to his question , @entity11 responded harshly			0
' kiss my a * *			0
this is a @entity127 site for the @entity6 people			0
show some respect , ' he said			0
going home : the foreign policy speech was on the last events of @entity1 's world tour			1
he returns home on wednesday later , he told a @entity137 reporter to ' shove it			0
' about 30 minutes later , the spokesman called reporters and apologized			0
however , it 's likely that for all the media bluster , @entity1 's ' gaffes ' on his foreign trip will effectively zero impact on his chances in the november election			1
a poll in may found that only one percent of voters said foreign policy was the most important issue in the race			1
the foreign trip also garnered front page coverage in several newspapers in the swing states of @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 -- with on - message stories about his support for @entity35 , not articles about his slip - ups .			2

latest distraction comes on final leg of international trip to @entity19 , @entity35 and @entity6
@entity10 presidential candidate was accused of making ' racist ' remark about @entity37 on visit to @entity35
@entity174 politicians jeered @entity1 last week for suggesting @entity19 was n't ready for @entity23
gaffes might not matter to voters , though -- only one percent say foreign policy is the most important issue
