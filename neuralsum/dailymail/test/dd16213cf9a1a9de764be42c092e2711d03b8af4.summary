a small ' hot spot ' in the @entity1 is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the @entity4 - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why			1
the hot spot , near the @entity9 intersection of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , covers only about 2,500 square miles ( 6,500 square kilometers ) , or half the size of @entity15			1
a recent @entity17 map shows is produces more than triple the standard ground - based estimate - and researchers say they do n't know why			0
the hot spot , near the @entity9 intersection of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , covers only about 2,500 square miles			1
methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere			2
like carbon dioxide , it contributes to global warming			0
to calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air , the authors performed high - resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model , which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds			1
researchers from several institutions are now in the @entity9 region of the @entity1 with a suite of airborne and ground - based instruments , aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane ' hot spot ' detected from space			1
' with all the ground - based and airborne resources that the different groups are bringing to the region , we have the unique chance to unequivocally solve the @entity9 mystery , ' said @entity59 , a scientist at @entity17 's @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , who is heading @entity17 's part of the effort			2
other investigators are from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) in @entity68 , @entity11 ; the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) ; and the @entity70 , @entity71			2
last fall , researchers including @entity59 reported that a small region around the @entity9 intersection of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the @entity4			1
an instrument on a @entity81 satellite measuring greenhouse gases showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between 2003 and 2009			1
the amount of methane observed by the satellite was much higher than previously estimated			2
the satellite observations were not detailed enough to reveal the actual sources of the methane in the @entity9			1
likely candidates include venting from oil and gas activities , which are primarily coalbed methane exploration and extraction in this region ; active coal mines ; and natural gas seeps			2
researchers from @entity67 , @entity69 's @entity98 and @entity99 are conducting a field campaign called @entity101 ( @entity102 and natural gas emissions ) 2015 , bringing airborne and ground - based instruments to investigate possible sources of the methane hot spot			1
@entity108 , @entity12 , is in the @entity9 region where an atmospheric methane " hot spot " can be seen from space			1
researchers are currently in the area , trying to uncover the reasons for the hot spot			1
the @entity60 team will join the effort on april 17 and fly two complementary remote sensing instruments on two @entity102 research aircraft			0
the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , which observes spectra of reflected sunlight , flies at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region			0
using this information and ground measurements from the other research teams , the @entity129 ( @entity130 ) will fly over suspected methane sources , making additional , highly sensitive measurements of methane			0
depending on its flight altitude , the @entity17 aircraft can image methane features with a spatial resolution better than three feet ( one meter ) square			2
in other words , it can create a mosaic showing how methane levels vary every few feet , enabling the identification of individual sources			0
hotspot of total column methane anomalies centered over the @entity9 region from 2003 to 2009 , when a satellite - based methane - measuring instrument was operational			1
the april study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane sources producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentrations			1
with the combined resources , the investigators hope to quantify the region 's overall methane emissions and pinpoint contributions from different sources			0
they will track changes over the course of the month - long effort and study how meteorology transports emissions through the region			0
' if we can verify the methane detected by the satellite and identify its sources , decision - makers will have critical information for any actions they are considering , ' said @entity67 scientist @entity176 , one of the mission 's investigators			0
part of president @entity181 's recent @entity180 calls for reductions in methane emissions			0
the research team also includes scientists from the @entity186 at the @entity187 ; the @entity4 @entity188 ; and the state of @entity12			1
is this the cause ? the @entity9 coal - fired power plant , near @entity192 , is one of the targets @entity17 wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane in each of the seven years studied from 2003 - 2009 , the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere			1
this is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the @entity202 's widely used @entity203			0
in the study published online today in the journal @entity207 , researchers used observations made by the @entity81 's @entity209 for @entity212 ( @entity211 ) instrument , which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012			0
the atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period			1
a ground station in the @entity217 , operated by the @entity219 's @entity218 , provided independent validation of the measurement			0
to calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air , the authors performed high - resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model , which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds			2
research scientist @entity59 of @entity17 's @entity60 ( @entity60 ) in @entity61 , @entity62 , first noticed the @entity9 signal years ago in @entity211 data			2
' we did n't focus on it because we were n't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error , ' @entity59 said			0
the study 's lead author , @entity237 of the @entity70 , @entity71 , noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking , near the hot spot			1
this indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in @entity12 's @entity249 , which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country			1
natural gas is 95 - 98 percent methane			2
methane is colorless and odorless , making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments			0
' the results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried , ' @entity237 said			0
' there 's been so much attention on high - volume hydraulic fracturing , but we need to consider the industry as a whole			0
' in just one place in the @entity4 do four states meet			2
the borders of @entity13 , @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity10 intersect at @entity9 , west of the confluence of the @entity270 and @entity271			1
coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal			2
in underground coal mines , it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock			0
after the @entity4 energy crisis of the 1970s , techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel			1
by 2012 , coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the @entity4			1
@entity59 noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space - based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases			0
' satellite data can not be as accurate as ground - based estimates , but from space , there are no hiding places , ' @entity59 said			0
in march 2014 the @entity296 announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its @entity299			0
the strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data .			0
