the secret to successfully adapting from city to country life is to spend as much time in the pub as possible and to take the dog for a walk , research has revealed			1
a survey , which spoke to 501 people who had recently ditched the rat race for rural life , asked how they had adjusted to their new community			1
it found the pub to be one of the best ways to mingle with locals , as well as joining the church and using stores in the area as frequently as possible			1
file photo the research , commissioned by @entity28 , also revealed that more than a quarter of those who have recently moved to the countryside admitted it was harder than they thought it would be			1
a yearning for the bright city lights and the dramatic change in the pace of life proved to be some of the most difficult hurdles to overcome			0
it also emerged that typically it takes people a year and two weeks to feel totally settled in their new surroundings			2
but despite extensive efforts , around one in ten said they had ' failed ' to integrate , and were happy to consider themselves ' not part of the community '			1
the survey also found those who enjoyed a seamless transition from city to country made an effort to go to as many local events as possible in a bid to meet people			1
walking a pet around the streets was also revealed as an effective way to get to know neighbours and other villagers			0
buying all produce locally also helped as did volunteering where possible			2
throwing parties for @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 also made a significant difference in the amount it took people to settle after moving from a city			2
holding coffee mornings and offering to ' pet - sit ' are also tactics which appear to have worked			0
the study also showed that more than half of those polled who had made the move had since managed to persuade friends or family to come and join them away from the hustle and bustle of a city			0
most of those ( 23 % ) who quit city life said they did so because they wanted to escape the rat race , while one in five moved for employment reasons			0
@entity92 , moving back to their roots , or upping sticks to move closer to an elderly relative were also common reasons for making the move			0
others moved after retiring or to downsize			0
and the move is clearly one worth making , as three quarters of the respondents stated they were ' much happier ' in the country than they were in the city			0
but almost one in three said they had mulled over the possibility of returning to city life			0
a @entity28 spokesperson said : ' moving somewhere new can leave us feeling like a fish out of water			1
' so it makes sense that popping into the local for a pint or a meal from time to time can help people ease themselves into a new area and way of life			1
' good village pubs are alive and kicking , and they are often still seen as the heart of smaller communities , so they are an obvious place to start socialising with local people			2
