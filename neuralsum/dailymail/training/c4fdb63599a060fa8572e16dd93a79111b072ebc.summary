by @entity0 a top @entity2 private school has agreed to settle a landmark lawsuit brought by former pupils who claim its former football coach sexually abused boys there over a 20 - year period			1
@entity10 in @entity11 was accused of covering up abuse allegedly carried out by @entity13 in a case that shockingly mirrors the @entity16 scandal			1

accused : former football coach @entity13 ( no deceased ) is accused of abusing hundreds of boys at @entity10 in @entity11 over a 20 - year period a sexual abuse lawsuit was filed in 2009 by ten former students and two day campers at @entity10			1
at a hearing earlier this year , a lawyer representing the 12 victims argued that the abuse could have been prevented had the school not buried the football coach ’s abuse in a bid to protect its reputation and athletic program			2
@entity38 claimed that the school ’s cover - up prevented @entity13 ’s victims from taking legal action against the school in time , before the statute of limitations expired			2
but in what could be a landmark decision for sexual abuse survivors , @entity47 district court judge @entity46 ruled in august that portions of the lawsuit could proceed because administrators may have lied when they said they did not become aware of the abuse allegations until 1991 , according to the @entity55			1

the cover - up continued for another 25 years until @entity81 , a @entity82 - based journalist and former student , told of the abuse he had suffered at the hands of the coach and wrote about the scandal			0
he was contacted by mr @entity38 , who filed the civil suit which sought damages of $ 20 million for each of the plaintiffs , in 2009			1
