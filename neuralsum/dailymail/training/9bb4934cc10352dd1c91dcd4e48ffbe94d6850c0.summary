by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 11 october 2013 an overweight shepherdess who kept being outrun by her sheep can now keep up with the flock after losing six stone			2
@entity5 , 39 , tipped the scales at 20st after years of eating rich dairy products like cheese			1
her weight meant she found it difficult to herd her 62 pedigree sheep and often ended up out of breath when chasing after them			2
shepherdess @entity5 with her husband @entity14 on their wedding day in april 1999 @entity5 , pictured before her weight loss with one of her prize winning sheep ( left ) has dropped to a trim 13st 8lbs and size 14 she embarked on a diet last year and after reigning in her love of cheese , she has dropped from a size 28 to a size 14			1
@entity5 , from @entity27 , near @entity28 , @entity29 , is now a healthy 13st 8lbs and has been nicknamed the @entity30 by friends			1
she said : ' i breed and show a flock of pedigree sheep as a hobby and when they had lambs in the spring they used to outrun me			2
' i have n’t got a sheepdog so i have round them up myself but i would look really silly because i could n’t keep up with them , especially the lambs			0
' i started putting on weight in my teens because i was eating the wrong things like lots of cheese and milk			0
@entity5 , pictured with her prize winning pedigree sheep , found it increasing hard to keep up with her flock ' in my late teens i started getting teased at school about my size and i was just known as the large , jolly one			1
' i joined @entity56 once and lost about two stone but i did n’t have the motivation to keep it up , so i put the weight back on and more			0
' the maximum weight i reached was about 20st and i started having health problems so my gp offered to put me on an @entity64 - funded diet plan for 12 weeks			1
' this time i saw it through and i have got down to 13st 8lbs			0
@entity5 can now keep up with the demand of the flock after losing an incredible 6st on an @entity64 funded 12 week diet ' i met my husband when i started putting on the weight and by the time we got married i was much larger			1
looking back at pictures , i look like a sack of spuds on my wedding day			0
' i now look in the mirror and often do n’t recognise myself and i ’m still getting used to being slimmer			0
' the hardest thing to cut back on has definitely been cheese and milk , i used to milk cows so the temptation to have a bit of milk was very hard to resist			0

@entity5 began gaining weight in her teens by *over-indulging* in dairy foods
the shepherdess reached 20st and could **n't** keep up with her flock
does **n't** use a sheepdog , instead rounding up her pedigree sheep herself
was put on a @entity64 funded diet and cut down on her beloved cheese
now weighs 13st 8lbs and has gone from a size 28 to a size 14
