by @entity0 @entity1 : 22:36 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 23:37 est , 30 december 2013 a @entity4 bar owner hit with a cease and desist order from @entity6 responded sarcastically and even proposed a mock settlement			1
the sarcasm - filled letter was sent from @entity10 and @entity12 owner @entity11 to lawyers for the coffee giant demanding he change the name of one of his in - house brews from ‘ @entity19 ’ so it was not confused with a the chain 's popular ‘ @entity21 ' drink			1
mr @entity23 referred to the beer as ‘ @entity25 ’ throughout the letter , mockingly apologized for ‘ any damage ’ caused and cut a check for the $ 6 in profit earned from the three beers sold under the similar name			2
funny man : @entity23 's humorous response has drawn a lot of attention to his @entity4 brewpub hilarious : @entity10 and @entity12 owner @entity23 's response to a @entity6 cease and desist letters mocks the coffee giant 's lawyers and even proposes a $ 6 settlement the row began when @entity6 lawyers became aware of the ‘ @entity25 ’ beer after a handful of customers checked un on beer social network @entity50 saying they drank it – they soon sent a letter to mr @entity23 , which he posted to his bar 's facebook page			1
the letter was first spotted by the website @entity60			0
the letter from the attorneys accused mr @entity23 of trying to ‘ cause confusion , mistake or deception ’ among people who may think he is affiliated with @entity6 – his response put those fears to rest after first apologizing for his poor spelling			0
the name of his beer was spelled ' @entity73 , ' @entity6 spells their frozen coffee drink as ' frappucino			2
' ‘ we never thought that our beer drinking customers would have thought that the alcoholic beverage coming out of the tap would have actually been coffee from one of the many , many , many stores located a few blocks away , ’ the bar owner wrote			0
settlement proposal : a check for the $ 6 profit he made from selling the three beers it does n't look like a @entity6 : owner @entity23 mockingly claimed that the sheer number of @entity6 locations may have convinced people they were able to get coffee from his bar 's beer taps a batch of his own : mr @entity23 's bar serves beers brewed across the country , as well as his own brews - he is shown here making a batch of an unnamed beer ‘ i guess that with there being a @entity6 on every corner of every block in every city that some people may think they could get a @entity6 at a local bar , ’ he continued			1
‘ that was our mistake			0
‘ we are bad people			0
we feel shame … we also promise to stop production of our ‘ @entity118 ’s - @entity117 ’ for fear of further repercussions , ’ mr @entity23 sarcastically wrote			0
he also included a $ 6 check that was the sum total of profits received from the sale of the three beers in question , because ‘ us small business owners need to stick together			1

the coffee giant sent a cease and desist order to @entity130 over a similarly named beer
the bar spelled the beer 's name ' *frappicino* , ' the @entity6 drink is spelled ' frappucino '
owner @entity11 's *saracastic* , mocking reply even included a $ 6 check to cover the profits he made
