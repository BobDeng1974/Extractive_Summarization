by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:42 pm on 2nd december 2011 a police officer was so determined to get justice for an elderly war veteran robbed in his own home that he studied law in his spare time to force reluctant prosecutors to act			1
detective constable @entity9 was appalled when the @entity10 refused to take action against a woman suspected of stealing £ 600 from 85 - year - old @entity13			2
but instead of accepting its decision , he researched the law and consulted a @entity18 professor to prove it was possible to charge the alleged thief , even though the only witness – mr @entity13 – had died			1
impressive : detective constable @entity9 , left , from @entity21 , was honoured for his determined out of hours work to secure a conviction for @entity24 hero @entity13 who died after an attack in his own home @entity29 ’ perseverance paid off when a woman of 21 was jailed more than two years after the crime			1
his hard work and dedication was recognised last night when he was named runner - up in the @entity36 ’s first - ever @entity35			1
the 38 - year - old , who serves with the @entity38 , said : ‘ i wanted to get justice for the victim and his family – i could n’t let the attacker get away with it			1
’ mr @entity13 , who served in the @entity44 during the @entity24 , and was battling cancer , was targeted in a distraction burglary in @entity21 in november 2007			2
a woman , claiming to be from the council , conned her way into his home before letting in her male accomplice			2
the pair then assaulted mr @entity13 and fled with £ 600 in cash			2
fingerprints were discovered in the house but no immediate match was found and , in the days after the incident , mr @entity13 asked for the case to be dropped because he was too ill to pursue it			0
high level advice : @entity61 contacted @entity18 law experts in his drive for justice for war veteran @entity13 he was battling both lung and prostate cancer			1
he moved in to a residential home and died five months later			0
in may 2009 , a young woman was arrested following a violent dispute and her fingerprints matched those taken from mr @entity13 ’s home			0
she was interviewed but denied involvement , claiming instead that mr @entity13 had attempted to sexually assault her			0
she later admitted lying and confessed she was present during the robbery but denied taking part in the violence			0
however , the @entity10 refused to charge her because of human rights laws which state that a defendant ’s lawyer should be allowed to cross-examine the only witness			0
but once mr @entity13 died , police had only hearsay evidence in statements from his daughter and granddaughter , whom he phoned immediately after the robbery , and the first police officer at the scene			1
@entity61 said : ‘ i started studying the law on hearsay			1
i looked into @entity95 case law , @entity97 judgments and the principles of the @entity99 , in relation to when a witness has died			2
’ @entity61 also contacted @entity18 professor @entity102 , an expert on hearsay evidence			1
prosecutors relented and in early 2010 the woman admitted robbery and was jailed for four years			1
her accomplice is still being sought			0
the case is now used as an aide in the training of prosecutors			0
mr @entity13 ’s granddaughter @entity110 , 36 , said her family were extremely grateful to the detective			0
‘ he went above and beyond his duties , ’ she said			0
mr @entity9 ’ boss , chief superintendent @entity114 , said : ‘ this is an excellent detective case , it is a little bit like an episode of @entity118 , but this is reality			0
’ @entity29 won a commendation by @entity38 police authority – its highest accolade – before being nominated for the national award .			2
