by @entity0 babies will be born deaf and blind unless they are given the @entity3 jab , a leading expert has warned			1
professor @entity5 said the measles epidemic that has centred in @entity7 is just one part of a much wider problem that could lead to disabling and even life - threatening outbreaks of mumps and rubella			1
the reluctance to immunise babies came about in 1998 after a scientific paper was published by @entity16 in @entity17			0
it claimed that children who had the combined vaccine were at a greater risk of developing autism and colitis			0
unvaccinated teenagers are putting their future children at risk of catching mumps and rubella which could leave them blind , deaf and with heart problems rates of immunisation plummeted after the article and although numbers have risen steadily since the study was discredited , more than 300,000 @entity36 children aged between 10 and 16 remain unvaccinated			1
a further 300,000 have only had one of the recommended two doses of the vaccine			0
professor @entity5 , the former chief executive of the @entity41 , wrote in the @entity42 that children who missed out on the jab are now teenagers and that many will soon become pregnant			1
he explained that mumps can render young men infertile and added that women infected with rubella have a 20 per cent chance of abortion			2
a large number of babies who survive will suffer with permanent deafness , blindness and heart problems associated with rubella syndrome			1
pregnant women with rubella ( pictured ) have a 20 per cent chance of abortion ' we might think that the measles epidemic is the last gasp of mr @entity16			0
but i fear he still has more damage to wreak , ' professor @entity5 said			1
he added that people were in danger of forgetting the ' miraculous ' powers of vaccines because immunising causes us to forget quite how dangerous infections disease are			0
rubella numbers have risen in recent years			2
last year there were 65 cases in @entity76 alone - the highest number for over a decade			1
@entity78 of deaf blind charity sense added that people who were born deaf and blind in the 1950s and 1960s still require long - term care			1
he said : ' a baby born affected by rubella is said to have congenital rubella syndrome			2
many will have hearing loss , cataracts , other eye conditions , heart problems requiring significant hospital treatment and ongoing health concerns that affect a person throughout their lives			2
' you ca n't wait for an outbreak and then react			0
the only want to to protect women is to stop the disease [ with universal immunisation ]			0
' dr @entity99 , action on @entity101 , added that congenital rubella syndrome could have social consequences too : â€˜ it is really important that people take up the @entity3 vaccine , which offers protection against rubella			0
' although not life - threatening , hearing loss has significant personal and social costs and can lead to high levels of social isolation , with research also showing people with severe and profound levels of deafness being four times more likely to be unemployed than the general population			0

professor @entity5 has urged teenagers to get vaccinated to *prevent* wave of mumps and rubella
said their babies could be born deaf , blind , with heart problems as well as other congenital *abnormalities*
last year the number of rubella cases in @entity76 were at their highest in ten years
