monday evening is set to see @entity1 's closet call with an asteroid until 2027			2
the asteroid , designated 2004 @entity4 , will safely pass about three times the distance of @entity1 to the moon on january 26 - so close			1
it will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 @entity9 flies past @entity1 in 2027			2
scroll down for animation where to watch : observers in the @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time : from 8 p.m. @entity19 on monday evening , january 26th , until about 1 a.m. est on the 27th			1
observers in the @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time : from 8 p.m. @entity19 on monday evening , january 26th , until about 1 a.m. est on the 27th			1
during this time 2004 @entity4 will be heading northward through the dim constellation cancer			1
it skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the @entity26 ( or @entity26 ) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. est. from its reflected brightness , astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile ( 0.5 kilometers ) in size			1
at the time of its closest approach on january 26 , the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity1			2
' monday , january 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 @entity4 will get to @entity1 for at least the next 200 years , ' said @entity37 , who is retiring as manager of @entity40 's @entity39 at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , after 16 years in the position			1
' and while it poses no threat to @entity1 for the foreseeable future , it 's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid , so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more			1
' observers in the @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time : from 8 p.m. @entity19 on monday evening , january 26th , until about 1 a.m. est on the 27th			1
during this time 2004 @entity4 will be heading northward through the dim constellation cancer			1
it skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the @entity26 ( or @entity26 ) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. est. because it 's relatively large , 2004 @entity4 will brighten rapidly as it approaches @entity1			1
but this object should be bright enough to follow with a 3 - or 4 - inch - diameter telescope as it moves among the stars			0
' to track down the asteroid , you 'll need a detailed star chart that shows the exact path of 2004 @entity4 , ' explains @entity66 , a senior editor at @entity67			1
' our charts were specially prepared for this event			0
' the asteroid 's closest approach to @entity1 actually occurs hours earlier , around 11 a.m. est on the 26th			2
lmost exactly when it becomes brightest ( about 9th magnitude ) , asteroid 2004 bl86 skirts very close to the @entity26 , @entity26			2
during this time 2004 @entity4 will be heading northward through the dim constellation cancer			1
it skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the @entity26 ( or @entity26 ) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. est. the asteroid orbits the @entity81 every 1.84 years			0
it was discovered 11 years ago by the @entity83 telescope in @entity84 , which was designed to hunt for such objects			0
despite the asteroid 's two close visits then and now , it wo n't approach @entity1 again this closely for another 200 years			2
astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number , 357439 , but it has not yet been named			0
but at that time it 's predicted to be somewhat dimmer , about magnitude 10 , because @entity1 will see only a portion of its illuminated side			0
the asteroid brightens , despite the increasing distance , because we 're seeing its face become more fully illuminated			0
' one good technique for fast - movers like 2004 @entity4 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path , ' explains @entity103 , also a @entity67 senior editor			1
' then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star			0
' one way @entity40 scientists plan to learn more about 2004 @entity4 is to observe it with microwaves			1
@entity40 's @entity111 antenna at @entity112 , @entity43 , and the @entity113 in @entity114 will attempt to acquire science data and radar - generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to @entity1			1
' when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby , we will have the first detailed images , ' said radar astronomer @entity124 of @entity41 , the principal investigator for the @entity112 radar observations of the asteroid			0
' at present , we know almost nothing about the asteroid , so there are bound to be surprises			0
' asteroid 2004 @entity132 was initially discovered on jan. 30 , 2004 by a telescope of the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) survey in @entity135 , @entity84			0
the asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars			0
' i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself , ' said @entity37			0
' asteroids are something special			0
not only did asteroids provide @entity1 with the building blocks of life and much of its water , but in the future , they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources			2
' they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system			0
there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up			0
' see the asteroid 's route below at the time of its closest approach on january 26 , the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity1 .			2

2004 @entity4 will pass about three times the distance of @entity1 to the moon
estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile ( 0.5 kilometers ) in size
@entity40 says it poses no threat to @entity1 ' for the foreseeable future '
observers in the @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 have the best seats
