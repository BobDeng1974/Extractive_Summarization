who could possibly have imagined even a year or two ago that @entity5 would have a chance of overhauling @entity0 ? but that was the prospect savoured by @entity61 ' double promotion - winners and it was enough to fill the @entity63 even with live television cameras peering in			1
@entity61 rated it the biggest league game of his career as well as being the biggest of @entity5 's modern history			2
at the start only three points - in @entity0 favour - separated these @entity72 sides who ordinarily could never be described as rivals			1
but @entity45 scored against the run of play to cushion the threat			1
@entity46 split the @entity5 rearguard and as defenders looked for offside , @entity45 timed his run and calm finish to perfection			1
either side of the @entity87 's third @entity0 goal , @entity84 failed with a great chance for a @entity5 and @entity10 forced @entity34 into a full - length save			1
@entity27 fired home from 25 yards for his first goal since £ 350,000 club record move from @entity93 but @entity0 were increasingly menacing on the break to justify their advantage			0
it was their first meeting in ten seasons			0
the @entity99 ' @entity23 and @entity17 had spells at @entity101 - and midfielder @entity102 is a lifelong supporter			0
@entity103 fired @entity0 ahead in the 30th minute at the @entity63 on friday night @entity5 's @entity20 battles for the ball with @entity0 midfielder @entity42 @entity0 boss @entity3 has recorded two draws and two defeats in his first four games in charge @entity5 's rushed start to the second half was rewarded when @entity0 fan @entity102 made a surging run into the area			1
his fierce shot was parried by @entity34 and @entity10 expertly hooked in the loose ball			0
then substitute @entity14 exploded off the bench as @entity61 ' team seized the lead with a second goal in six minutes			0
@entity27 thundered in from 25 yards , the youngster 's first goal as a £ 350,000 club record signing from @entity93 .			0

@entity45 put @entity0 ahead against the run of play in @entity72 derby
@entity10 and @entity14 score in second - half for @entity5
