last night , a spokesman for the @entity68 ’s @entity67 said : ‘ “ viewers will be left wondering why the cost of a tv licence is not coming down when they are being subjected to more and more repeats			0
amusing as it is , licence fee payers will question why it costs £ 145 a year to watch @entity20 for the umpteenth time - if they wanted to watch it on endless repeat , they could buy the dvds			2
the @entity15 has to focus on delivering better value for money or sympathy for the tv tax will continue to wane			0
