@entity4 of @entity5 , @entity1 was shocked when she realized her brand new 2015 @entity7 had been stolen from her driveway on monday night , just a little over a month after she took the car home			1
then , on april 1 , @entity4 was shocked to learn that police had found her car after receiving a tip from a man who recognized the vehicle as @entity4 's and would be returning it to her - but with a few minor changes			1
this b * * * h is pimpin now ! ! ! ' as the car pulled up , @entity4 noticed that the rims had been spray painted red , there was red detailing on the sides of the car , and her steering wheel now had some orange accents			1
rather than get upset however , she simply took to @entity24 and posted a photo of her and her new ride , writing ; ' i want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me ...			1
this b * * * h is pimpin now ! ! ! ' she also attached a photo of the car which , given the date , many thought was a joke			2
it was not all ' lollipops and rainbows ' though @entity4 told @entity51 , and she is now getting the vehicle professionally cleaned to deal with the strong smell of cigarettes and marijuana			0
she is also creating a smoothie at the restaurant she owns , @entity58 , to honor @entity59 , the man who located her car and notified police			0
