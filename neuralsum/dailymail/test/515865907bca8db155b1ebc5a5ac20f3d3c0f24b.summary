president @entity0 and @entity2 president @entity1 shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see @entity2 declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism			1
the two leaders , who clasped hands yesterday at a brief meeting , are both attending the @entity9 in @entity10			1
the gesture of friendships is an outward symbol of @entity0 's project to thaw diplomatic relations with @entity2 , which have been frozen since the 1960s			1
the @entity17 has set expectations for a ' substantive ' exchange between @entity1 , brother of revolutionary leader @entity21 , and @entity0 today			1
speculation is high that a result of the exchange could be the official removal of @entity2 from the @entity27 's list of state terror sponsors			2
that removal would also lift some economic sanctions on @entity2			1
the president 's eventual aim is to restore full diplomatic relations and boost trade and travel between the two countries			0
their rapprochement , first unveiled in a historic policy shift in december , is the central issue at the @entity9 meeting in @entity10			2
@entity0 said : ' as we move towards the process of normalization , we 'll have our differences , government to government , with @entity2 on many issues			2
just as we differ at times with other nations within the @entity67 , just as we differ with our closest allies			0
' but the 53 - year - old @entity0 , who was not even born when @entity21 and @entity1 swept to power in @entity2 's 1959 revolution , also said the @entity71 is no longer interested in trying to impose its will on @entity74			1
' the days in which our agenda in this hemisphere so often presumed that the @entity71 could meddle with impunity , those days are past , ' he said			0
apart from a couple of brief , informal encounters , the leaders of the @entity71 and @entity2 have not had any significant meetings since the @entity1 brothers toppled @entity71 - backed dictator @entity84 and then steered their @entity86 country into a close alliance with the @entity88			1
last time : @entity0 and @entity1 are pictured above shaking hands at the funeral of @entity44 , held in @entity91 , @entity45 , in december 2013 out of the deep freeze : @entity0 and @entity1 are expected to meet again on saturday and talk about their efforts to restore full diplomatic relations and boost trade and travel between the two countries @entity100 's all here : president @entity0 ( far right middle row ) and @entity2 's president @entity1 ( far left middle row ) attend the @entity9 opening ceremony @entity107 president @entity106 hailed @entity0 's push to improve relations with @entity2 , saying it was helping to heal a ' blister ' that was hurting the region			1
however , @entity2 dissident @entity113 said civic groups in @entity2 have been sidelined from talks and appealed to @entity0 to support their push for more democracy			2
' the @entity2 government is showing no goodwill ... they do n't want to make any kind of concessions , ' he said			0
@entity0 , who met with activists from across @entity74 , including two @entity2 dissidents , appears to be close to removing communist - run @entity2 from a @entity71 list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism			1
its inclusion on the list brings a series of automatic @entity71 sanctions and @entity2 is insisting it be taken off as a condition of restoring diplomatic ties			2
@entity136 imposed trade sanctions on @entity2 from 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 , but the ensuing freeze did it no favors , said @entity141 , @entity0 's deputy national security adviser			1
' our @entity2 policy , instead of isolating @entity2 , was isolating the @entity71 in our own backyard , ' he noted			2
the two countries have maintained contact through interests sections in @entity148 and @entity136 since 1977 , and in recent years they have increasingly cooperated on issues such as migration and drug trafficking			0
the @entity27 has now recommended that @entity2 be taken off the terrorism list , a @entity71 @entity153 aide said			2
@entity0 is expected to agree , although it is not clear whether he will announce it during the summit			0
historic : president @entity0 ( right ) waving among @entity1 other presidents before the opening ceremony of the @entity159 @entity0 has already used his executive authority to ease some trade and travel restrictions , and is seeking to encourage nascent small businesses in @entity2 by allowing more exports there			1
but only @entity166 , controlled by @entity165 , can remove the overall @entity71 economic embargo on the island			0
the rapprochement by @entity0 has met some resistance in @entity136 and among some influential @entity171			0
critics say @entity2 should not be rewarded unless it changes its one - party political system			0
while @entity0 's policy has been widely praised around @entity74 , this was tempered last month when his administration imposed sanctions on @entity178 , @entity2 's closest ally and main benefactor			1
that controversy now hangs over the summit this weekend			0
@entity178 president @entity182 plans to present @entity0 with a petition signed by millions of people demanding that the sanctions be reversed			0
he is certain to receive support from @entity1 and other left - wing leaders in @entity74			0
' it is no time for imperialism , threats , it is time for peace , co-operation , union , progress , prosperity , ' @entity182 said on arrival in @entity10 .			0
