finally , he drove into a cul - de - sac where he jumped out of the moving car and ran off after it crashed into a parked vehicle			2
at @entity13 crown court , @entity2 , from @entity30 , @entity13 , admitted dangerous driving , failing to stop for the police , having no insurance and having no @entity35			2
he told the court he illegally drove the @entity7 - which he owns - because his mother was unable to pick him up			1
when police officers - investigating reports of a stolen @entity7 - checked his number plates they found it related to another car - @entity2 's father 's @entity44 , which made them suspicious			1
judge @entity46 gave him a six month jail term suspended for a year and banned him from driving for 30 months			1
@entity49 , defending @entity2 , told the court the day started badly for @entity2 when his mother - who had arranged to pick him up and take him to the test centre - rang to say she could not make it because her car had broken down			1
' he knew he had a driving lesson at 7am , an hour before the test , and he took the impulsive and very foolish decision to drive himself to the centre , ' said mr @entity49			2
' it is something that one could n't really make up , but there you are			0
' he was very anxious to take his test			0
i have asked him repeatedly to try to explain why he did what he did			0
' there were two bad decisions			0
one was to get in the car at all and much worse was to take off when the police stopped him			0
' it is all the more ironic given that he is a man of good character who has worked constantly since leaving school , has a regular job and leaves home every morning at 6am for his work as a plant fitter			0
' all he can say is that when he was stopped he panicked and made a decision which was totally out of character			0
it is baffling that he behaved in this way			0
illegal : @entity2 was pulled over by police officers as he travelled to this test centre in @entity13 in a high - powered @entity7 ' he wishes to say how very remorseful he is for what he has done			1
' prosecutor @entity84 said police on patrol at 6.30am on april 11 had been told to look out for a stolen @entity7			0
they saw @entity2 in his @entity7 and decided go check it			1
@entity2 was signalled to pull in and when the officers checked his number plates they found it related to another car - @entity2 's father 's @entity44			1
as an officer was telling him to open the door and switch off the engine , @entity2 raced off and the patrol car went in pursuit			0
he sped through red traffic lights without stopping and reached 70mph over speed bumps and in 30mph zones			1
at one point , a ' stinger ' was deployed by officers but @entity2 carried on driving until he turned into a cul - de - sac			2
he flung open the driver 's door and jumped out before it collided with a parked car			0
sentenced : at @entity112 , judge @entity46 gave @entity2 a six month jail term suspended for a year and banned him from driving for 30 months @entity2 was then arrested and explained he had been on his way to take his driving test but knew that as a learner he should not have been driving alone			1
' he explained to the police that as he did n't have anyone to take him to the test centre he was driving himself there , ' mr @entity84 added			1
in sentencing @entity2 , judge @entity46 said : ' your explanation for being in that car that day is that you were off for a driving lesson and your test having been let down by your mother 's car breaking down , ' said the judge			2
' that is a tall story but i am prepared to believe it for the purposes of sentencing today			0
' this was an idiotic decision and you are now sensible enough to realise how idiotic it was			0
' but that decision was nothing like as idiotic as the next decision you made , which was to drive off when the police officers caused you to stop			0
' the way @entity2 drove was ' highly dangerous ' to other road users and it was lucky it was such a quiet time of day , the judge said			2
judge @entity46 also fined gough a total of £ 1,100 and ordered him to pay costs of £ 330 .			0
