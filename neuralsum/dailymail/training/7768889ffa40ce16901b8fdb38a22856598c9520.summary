by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 11 july 2013 a grieving father has been banned from the gp surgery he has attended for more than 60 years after raising concerns about @entity4 who failed to spot his son ’s deadly brain tumour			1
last week @entity8 , 62 , spoke of his devastation that his son , @entity10 , 34 , died of a brain tumour after being told his symptoms were caused by depression			1
he has now been left stunned after receiving a letter informing him he has a week to find a new doctor as his name is to be removed from the register at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			2
@entity8 has been banned from the @entity19 after going public about his concerns that his son could have received better treatment if he had not been repeatedly misdiagnosed the shock move came just days after mr @entity8 raised concerns about three of doctors at the surgery who treated his son			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ i ’m convinced this is the direct result of me raising concerns about my son ’s care in the local paper and the doctors clearly do not like any criticism			1
‘ people should be aware that if they complain about their gp , they could be struck off			0
‘ i have been at the surgery 62 years with no previous issues and could now struggle to find another practice			0
’ mr @entity8 claims he was given no warning of the removal - a move required by @entity46 guidelines - and was handed ‘ veiled threats ’ about going to the press with his concerns			1
the senior councillor at @entity50 was shocked when he received the letter which stated : ‘ @entity19 has asked contractor services to remove your name from its list of @entity57 patients			1
‘ if you are not accepted by another doctor then your name will be removed from your present doctor ’s list on july 16 when his responsibility for your treatment will cease			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s son had seen three doctors at the surgery over a year who prescribed him with anti-depressants and sleeping tablets to deal with his developing symptoms			1
@entity72 , 34 , died of a brain tumour in may after being told repeatedly that he was suffering from depression it was not until mr @entity8 ’s son lost the use of his hand that the tumour , which was the size of a tennis ball , was discovered following a trip to @entity81			1
despite a four - hour emergency operation to remove the bulk of the tumour , he died on may 2 this year			2
@entity85 , speaking on behalf of @entity19 , said : ‘ the practice has removed mr @entity8 from its list because the doctor - patient relationship , based on trust and mutual respect , has broken down irretrievably			1
‘ the partners respected mr @entity8 ’s right to complain - indeed we have continued to offer @entity38 medical services throughout the complaints procedure			2
‘ mr @entity8 has articulated in no uncertain terms that he has no confidence in three doctors in the partnership			2
‘ the partners are on call in rotation and there may well be a situation when the only doctors available will be one or more of the three concerned			0
‘ under these circumstances the practice believes it is in mr @entity8 ’s best interest and that of the partnership that he register with another practice			2
’ mr @entity8 ’s son went to @entity111 in @entity20 , @entity21 , in december 2011 because he was struggling to talk and could not remember some words			1
@entity85 , speaking on behalf of the surgery , said : ' the practice has removed mr @entity8 from its list because the doctor - patient relationship , based on trust and mutual respect , has broken down irretrievably ' he visited the surgery with girlfriend @entity118 who had to speak for him because his speech had got so bad and was prescribed with antidepressant citalopram and sleeping tablets			2
his condition worsened over the @entity123 and he saw another doctor who prescribed more antidepressants			0
but by the end of january mr @entity8 was barely able to speak and he was referred to a mental health unit at @entity81			0
but when he got to the mental health unit , staff were unable to understand him and he left			0
when father and late mother , @entity131 , 59 , noticed that he could not use his right hand they were told by @entity134 to take him to @entity81 where the tumour was discovered			0
he was transferred to @entity136 , @entity137 , where drugs improved his speech but two months later his situation deteriorated rapidly and he died			0
@entity8 believes his son may have received better treatment sooner if he had been properly assessed and diagnosed			1
a practice spokesman speaking on behalf of @entity111 said : ' even though mr @entity8 has spoken publicly , we are unable to discuss confidential details of patient care			0
' the @entity146 conducted a thorough investigation and made no recommendations for action			0
we offer our sincere condolences to the family			0
