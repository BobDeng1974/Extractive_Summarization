@entity1 ’s biggest provider of laser eye surgery has been accused of using ‘ hard sell ’ tactics on its customers			1
the instructions for securing new patients for corrective treatment were uncovered in a confidential training booklet for staff at @entity11			1
the guidelines , which were marked as confidential , reportedly encourage front - of - house patient advisers to ‘ take control ’ of possible customers when they come in			1
‘ if you can find that personal connection , you can refer to it later and share it with your optometrist			0
a good nugget can be the difference between a booker and a thinker , ’ the instructions say , according to @entity28 , which has seen the leaked document			2
the guide suggests that if the potential customer is a ‘ thinker ’ they may need reassurance , the newspaper reports			2
‘ face your patient , put the pen down , and look them in the eye , ’ the instructions state , adding : ‘ use statements like : “ what price can you put on your eyesight ? ” , “ remember you do this for the rest of your life ” , ie @entity45 investment			2
’ other instructions include briefing optometrists about the ‘ type ’ of patient they may end up operating on and to do so ‘ out of sight and hearing of patient ’			0
this briefing would include ‘ things to avoid ’ discussing with the patient , @entity28 reports			0
it comes amid calls for tougher regulations of the industry including from the @entity72 mp @entity71			0
the guidelines , which were marked as confidential , encourage front - of - house patient advisers to ‘ take control ’ of possible laser eye surgery customers when they come in ( file picture ) the newspaper quotes @entity79 , a campaigner calling for tighter regulations , as saying : ‘ these “ hard sell ” techniques may not be illegal , but they are totally inappropriate for a medical procedure and they should be illegal			1
