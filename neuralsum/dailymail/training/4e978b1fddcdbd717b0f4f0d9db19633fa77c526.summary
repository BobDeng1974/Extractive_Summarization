@entity0 has been seen wandering barefoot in the @entity1 after reportedly separating from her @entity4 ' warrior ' partner the report in a @entity7 newspaper does not mince words			1
it talks of a ‘ crazed ’ englishwoman arousing concerns for her safety in the @entity4 holy city of @entity14 in @entity15			1
it claims that in the confines of a @entity4 temple , she has been seen bathing in sacred pools ‘ without clothes ’ — which , if true , is an outrageous act in such a conservative , deeply spiritual society — and keeping her underwear near the holy book , akin to sacrilege			1
lately , it states , she has been seen wandering around in the streets , bazaars and temples alone , like a ‘ crazed person ’ , and has become the talk of the town			2
@entity33 , chief executor of the @entity34 @entity4 temple , is quoted asking for the @entity36 @entity35 to take her back and hand her over to her family			1
‘ if someone misbehaves with this foreign woman , ’ he is reported saying , ‘ then @entity15 will gain a bad reputation			1
’ the article — which claims the woman was left by her husband — suggests that some locals are worried she could be a @entity36 government spy , so bizarre is her behaviour			2
so who is this woman , the source of such worrying gossip ? none other than former socialite @entity0 , daughter of disgraced former @entity52 minister @entity51 and @entity4 convert who now goes by the name of @entity55			1
the unsubstantiated report , published in november , could n’t be in starker contrast to the glossy 2010 hello ! magazine spread celebrating the marriage of the former ‘ it - girl ’ , now 34 , and @entity61 , a @entity4 ‘ warrior ’ from the @entity1			1
it was an unlikely union from the start — @entity0 ’s life once centred on @entity67 parties , posh boys and polo — and rumours it was in trouble have been rife for months			1
last weekend , @entity0 ’s father finally confirmed it was over and that the couple , who met at a yoga retreat in the @entity78 of @entity79 , were now ‘ detached ’ — if , indeed , they were ever legally married			1
although they affirmed their commitment to each other in a ceremony in @entity79 attended by 150 holy men and 300 guests , there is doubt that the marriage was ever officially registered			2
according to a report in the @entity93 newspaper last september , the union came under strain when @entity0 did not appear before a magistrate to register the marriage and did n’t attend the funeral of @entity61 ’s father			1
this week , approached by the @entity99 as she attended a @entity4 festival , @entity0 politely declined to comment on her marriage or the report of naked bathing in holy pools ( @entity4 women usually go in fully clothed )			1
‘ i am really happy that you approached to speak with me , but i do not wish to speak to anyone			0
have a nice day , ’ she said , before disappearing into the crowd			0
while the marriage may be over , @entity0 ’s passion for her adopted religion remains undimmed			1
it is thought to be why she remains in @entity14 , even if her presence appears to cause consternation to other residents of the sleepy ‘ @entity116 ’			1
here , she is one of the few , if not the only , unattached @entity119 woman in the 16,000 population — such a rarity that police apparently turned up at her lodgings recently to ask why she was there and check all was well			2
according to a police officer , she was asked to fill out a foreigner ’s registration form — to ensure the safety of foreign nationals — on which she listed her status as ‘ unmarried ’ and named her father as an emergency contact			0
she then asked to be left alone			0
home for the privately educated art school graduate for the past few months has been a £ 12 - a - night room in a guest house , with nothing more than a bed , toilet and tv			2
transformation : @entity142 at a @entity144 film premiere in 2003 ( left ) and with @entity145 after their ' marriage ' described by staff as ‘ kind - hearted ’ , she is so environmentally conscious that she asks them ‘ not to waste water and electricity ’			1
‘ madam does n’t talk much , ’ said one			0
‘ she keeps to herself most of the time , but she would get really angry if someone left the lights on during the day			0
she would make sure the taps in her room never dripped water			0
’ according to locals , @entity142 first stayed in @entity14 last year with her husband , a member of a @entity4 order called the @entity162			1
when she returned six months ago , however , she was alone			0
for a month she stayed in a dera , or @entity4 seminary , before moving into lodgings			1
@entity166 , a caretaker at the @entity167 attended by @entity142 , told us : ‘ i was told that her husband was a @entity162 and that they had a break - up			1
‘ so when she came here , i could see she was heartbroken			0
in this house of @entity173 , she found peace			0
since then she comes to prayers at the gurdwara ( temple ) regularly			0
’ @entity51 , 72 , told the @entity99 : ‘ my daughter is still a very devoted @entity4 and i am personally still on good terms with @entity145			1
miss @entity0 's father told the @entity99 she remains a devoted @entity4 despite separating from her @entity15 ' husband ' ‘ they remain friends , but the marriage is not working in any sense that we would understand , and there is considerable doubt whether it was a lawful marriage ceremony — or so i am told			1
’ dismissing reports of her ‘ crazed ’ behaviour as ‘ nonsense ’ , he said : ‘ she likes to maintain her privacy			2
she does n’t have a mobile and it ’s hard to get hold of her			0
she tries to stay clear of the world			0
‘ i ’m absolutely confident that she is safe and knows what she is doing			0
she has lodgings which my ex-wife and i pay the rent for			2
‘ she was here in @entity36 until october and has been visited by several people since who have all said that she is safe and happy			0
’ @entity207 later confirmed : ‘ they were not married and are now detached			1
it was more a colourful , folklore ceremony than a proper one			0
i think both sides know the marriage is over , if it ever was a marriage			0
’ certainly @entity0 ’s faith appears to be deeply held			1
last month , she posted a new profile picture on @entity215 showing herself wearing a @entity4 turban			1
completely divorced from her old life of @entity144 parties — dwarves dressed in @entity221 outfits once served up toffee vodkas for guests at her 22nd birthday bash — @entity142 is devoted to spreading @entity4 principles and extols the @entity7 way of living on two websites			1
the former actress , who once posed naked for @entity229 , now writes about the benefits of wearing a chunni ( long scarf ) made of cotton rather than silk because it is ‘ cooling and calming for the mind ’			0
mr @entity51 added he remained on good terms with his daughter 's former partner devoted to charitable work and helping the poor , she has a vision of building schools , hospitals and meditation centres			0
in 2013 , her father revealed that when she returned to @entity36 to visit she refused to sleep in a bedroom , instead camping in the garden of her aunt , actress @entity250 , so she could lie on the earth			0
‘ it ’s all part of being close to the soil , ’ said mr @entity51			0
‘ i find it very hard to get my head around all this , but i love her dearly			0
’ formerly effusive about her ‘ noble ’ husband and their shared spirituality , @entity0 has kept quiet since their ‘ rough patch ’ became public knowledge			1
‘ many believe , do n’t talk unless it improves on silence , ’ is all she would say			0
asked about her marriage at a @entity4 conference in @entity144 in 2013 , she became defensive and finally replied : ‘ @entity173 is my true love			1
’ perhaps the only clue to what went wrong can be found in a cryptic message posted on the @entity274 website for which she occasionally writes			0
under the heading ‘ a biography — @entity55 ’ are the simple words : a lover			2
@entity282 ( @entity173 is the @entity283 )			0
a family friend said that @entity142 had been wrestling with the fact that , apart from their faith , she and @entity61 had very little in common : she saw herself as a free spirit , in touch with @entity290 , while he was more traditional and felt that her place was at home with him			1
‘ there ’s a feeling among her friends and family that she rushed into marriage , ’ says the friend			2
@entity0 and @entity145 met in 2009 and it was her love of @entity301 yoga , which is associated with @entity302 , that first drew her to the religion			2
by then her privileged upbringing had been shattered after her father was jailed for 18 months in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice			0
she had also discovered that her friend @entity309 was , in fact , her half - sister — the result of an affair between @entity51 and @entity314			2
‘ she could n’t be more different from the girl who used to walk down @entity317 , ’ said one old friend			2
‘ she looks unkempt , she does n’t cut her hair and when she was here she was telling everyone what they should and should n’t eat			0
’ yet , despite the end of her short - lived marriage , is she happy ? her father certainly believes so			2
and so does @entity142 .			2
