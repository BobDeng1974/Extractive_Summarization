on nights as dramatic as this , the temptation is to start with the match - winner and go from there			1
at the final whistle @entity7 ’s manager @entity6 marched across the turf to seek out @entity9 and throw his arms tightly around the @entity7 goalkeeper in a bear hug			1
without @entity9 between the posts against @entity15 , who knows whether @entity17 would have gone on to score @entity7 ’s corkscrew winner in the 89th minute			1
@entity17 is jubilant as he celebrates his late winner with substitute @entity20 , sending @entity21 into pandemonium @entity17 takes a moment to look to the heavens after sealing a precious victory in @entity7 's title charge the @entity7 players bundle on top of goalscorer @entity17 after his goal maintained their seven - point lead over @entity31 @entity32 clashes heads with @entity34 ( top right ) as ref @entity35 talks to @entity36 after @entity38 's red card @entity32 appeared to headbutt @entity34 as tempers flared in west @entity40 during a bad - tempered end to the game @entity32 also grabbed the @entity15 substitute round the neck in an ugly incident which could have repercussions for the @entity47 @entity6 marched onto the pitch after the final whistle to congratulate his players on a precious three points more on @entity9 in a minute because his performance against @entity54 ’s team is worthy of much more than a few token sentences in his honour			1
@entity15 lost this fixture because for one moment , one crazy moment , they failed to re-organise when @entity38 was sent off			1
in the pushing , the shoving and the shouting match that followed , @entity32 almost throttled substitute @entity34 , and then pushed his forehead into the side of the @entity15 player ’s head			1
but that was not the most damaging allegation laid at @entity32 ’s door			2
the question being asked on social media about the @entity47 was : did he actually bite @entity34 ? it is an amazing charge considering it was @entity32 who was bitten by @entity75 striker @entity74 two years ago			1
but because this is @entity7 , because this is @entity6 , the repercussions and the recriminations for @entity32 ’s actions are likely to last for days			2

for more stats visit out @entity123 @entity124 glides effortlessly with the ball with the @entity127 winning hearts and minds on his first full debut at @entity21 @entity36 was fortunate to escape without punishment after appearing to handle the ball in the area in the first half @entity107 had an excellent chance to break the deadlock , but saw his effort saved by @entity9 that is sad , because we should be celebrating a masterful performance by @entity9			1
@entity7 won this game , their 18th in the league this season , because @entity9 saved brilliantly twice , once in each half , from the feet of @entity107			1
for the first , he threw out a left leg to deflect @entity107 ’s effort wide of his post when @entity105 had split the @entity7 defence			1
he had to be on his game again in the second half when @entity107 , unmarked six yards out , should have put @entity15 in front			1
@entity9 ’s save was breathtaking			2
@entity92 will be sweating ahead of tuesday ’s @entity154 clash with @entity155			0
it is no longer clear cut who is no 1			0
‘ he touched the ball twice , he was a spectator , ’ said @entity6			0
‘ this is what we need — competition with @entity9 and @entity92			2
the focus must be permanent and also a keeper can be tired — it can affect your nervous system			0
@entity9 worked hard and i believed he was the best option because @entity81 was ill in the morning			2
’ this was a functional @entity7 performance , an average game against average opposition			2
@entity17 ’s finish was stunning , reading @entity97 ’s punched clearance and twisting his body to send his angled drive beyond the @entity15 keeper ’s near post			2
@entity81 and @entity100 battle for the ball as @entity7 threaten the @entity15 goalmouth @entity88 sticks out a hopeful boot but @entity15 keeper @entity97 was relieved to see the chance go begging @entity17 drops the shoulder and attempts to outfox @entity114 in the centre of midfield as the battle for possession heats up it did not help @entity54 ’s mood that the man who headed the @entity86 free kick into the penalty area was that man @entity32			1
was he was lucky to be on the pitch ? ‘ do n’t make me laugh , ’ claimed @entity6 when he was quizzed about the incident with @entity34			2
the @entity197 will decide upon the next course of action			0
the referee had 101 things to think about as players from both sides puffed out their chests			0
from the free - kick @entity7 scored a goal that keeps @entity31 at arm ’s length in the title race			2
to @entity17 ’s credit , it was a stunning finish			0
‘ when i have won titles in the past , there are always a couple of games when you win in the last minute , ’ admitted @entity6			0
they could easily have been ahead in the first half , particularly when @entity36 ’s bizarre ball - juggling act in the @entity15 penalty area went unpunished			1
this was a frustrating evening for @entity7 , one of those games they will be glad to have got out of the way			0
@entity88 was their chief threat and poor @entity114 had to be replaced by @entity34 at half - time having been booked for a foul on the @entity229			2
@entity34 then did a decent job of spoiling in midfield , but eventually @entity17 rescued @entity7 with his powerful strike from the edge of the area			1
undoubtedly , it was the save of the season so far			0
hazard gets combative as he attempts to stop the battling @entity114 from breaking away with the ball former @entity7 player @entity107 goes tumbling on his return to @entity21 after a tackle from @entity7 's @entity80 @entity7 players surround referee @entity35 as they attempt to curry favour with the @entity243 official @entity38 and @entity32 battle for a 50 - 50 ball as both sides shape each other up in the early stages @entity89 goes to ground and grasps on to @entity38 's shirt as the @entity7 striker seeks a free - kick @entity85 grapples with @entity101 as @entity7 and @entity15 do battle in an engaging first half @entity85 sees his shot fly past @entity257 as the @entity127 makes his first outing in a @entity7 shirt since joining from @entity260 @entity85 was it again early on , firing in another shot which had the @entity15 rearguard at panic stations @entity85 steals the ball from team - mate @entity83 and surges forward past @entity15 's @entity101 ( right ) to prompt another @entity7 attack @entity97 returned to the @entity15 starting line - up after recovering from a calf injury , despite the good form of back - up @entity109 @entity6 observes proceedings from the touchline with a trademark stare as @entity7 face @entity15 in west @entity40 @entity54 speaks to the assistant referee during the first half as the @entity15 boss attempts to make his point @entity9 was preferred to @entity92 in @entity7 ’s			1
@entity6 probably would n’t call it a dropping , but that ’s what it seemed like			0
@entity92 took his place on the bench , suggesting there was no injury to the @entity229			0
with the @entity154 clash against @entity155 on the horizon , on tuesday to be exact , it ’ll be interesting to see who the special one plumps for			0
@entity6 has enough time to think about his decision with @entity7 without a game this weekend following their shock @entity294 exit to @entity296			0
@entity297 was at @entity298 to watch the club he served as a player and coach			0
he was sat just behind the dug - outs			0
perhaps it rekindled memories of his bygone days in the @entity306 technical area under @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309			0
if @entity6 told his charges to keep a particular eye on @entity15 midfielder @entity312 , here ’s why			0
ahead of the encounter , the @entity314 international had scored in three of his last four @entity318 appearances against the @entity306			0
it would had been @entity312 ’s handball in the first - half that caught @entity6 ’s eye , though .			1

@entity7 left it late to break down @entity15 and maintained their seven - point lead at the top of the table
@entity17 struck the winner with just two minutes remaining at @entity21
@entity36 was lucky to go unpunished for a handball in the @entity15 *box* in the first - half
@entity32 could face *retrospective* punishment for apparent bite on @entity34
@entity84 saw his deflected shot ruled out for *offside* in the closing stages
@entity38 was sent off after receiving two *yellow* cards
@entity124 played in his first full start for @entity7 since his *£* *27m* move from @entity260
@entity107 should have scored against his former club but saw his shot saved by @entity9
