the frail pensioner thought so much of her ‘ best friend ’ that they even went on holiday together but @entity4 , 46 , was no @entity16 – she was ‘ grooming ’ mrs @entity2 in a bid to plunder her life savings , eventually stealing almost £ 2,000			1
friends : @entity2 , 76 , ( right ) was so close to @entity4 , 46 , ( left ) that the pair even holidayed to @entity22 together			1

the court heard @entity4 of @entity67 , near @entity68 , used the cash to pay for holidays and manicures			0

mrs @entity43 said : ‘ my mum could n’t cope with the fact somebody had done that to her			0
