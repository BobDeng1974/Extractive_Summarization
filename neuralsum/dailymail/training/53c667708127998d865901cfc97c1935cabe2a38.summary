@entity0 was named ‘ word of the 2013 ’ by @entity1 but now there 's a new term on the block : the usie			1
pronounced ' uss - ee ' - and rhyming with ' fussy ' - the word marks the growing trend for people squeezing their friends into their camera frame , as well as themselves			1
examples include the famous @entity15 usie taken by @entity16 and featuring @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , among others			1
say cheese ! there 's a new word to describe a group selfie and it 's usee ( pronounced uss - ee )			1
this is perhaps the most famous example , taken by @entity16 and featuring a host of @entity31 stars at the lastest @entity15 ceremony the ubiquitous selfie taken by @entity16 on @entity22 ’ phone was all over the media following the @entity15 the problem that many people highlighted was the fact that @entity16 's arms were n’t quite long enough to fit everyone in - but now there ’s a solution , dubbed the ' selfie stick			1
' a number of companies are now selling ' arm extenders ' that not only hold the camera , but are also used to take the shot and even focus the image			0
the trend for cameras on sticks , also known as monopods , is n’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including @entity58 and @entity59			0
monpods work by holding the camera in landscape mode , with the screen facing the photographer , and using the front - facing camera			2
buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device			0
depending on the model , some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm , or similar			0
others connect remotely via @entity76 and take the photo using software controls			2
some people think selfies are a mark of vanity and @entity83 , a professor of marketing at @entity85 in @entity86 who studies consumer behaviour , said : ‘ @entity88 are a growing trend that i think have far more social value than selfies			1
’ in contrast to one - person selfies , usies are ‘ more about the relationship , and less about you and your hair , ’ he said			1
the word , which can be spelled usie , and ussie , has been showing up in written material since at least april 2013 , according to @entity103 , executive producer of @entity104 and language columnist for @entity106			2
a business insider story from january noted that the outstretched arm of the photo - taker in usies is a ‘ signature ’ of the image , because the shooter has to get the camera far enough away to get the group in the frame			2
in march , @entity117 said pope @entity119 with visitors at the @entity121 last year ‘ could possibly be the first chronicled celebrity usie			1
’ other publications have proclaimed the selfie trend dead , with usies rising in popularity to replace them			2
‘ there are countless variations on the theme , including “ twofie , ” “ threefie , ” et cetera , if you want to specify the number of people photographed , ’ said @entity127			0
a recent study found that selfies taken of a couple , known as relfies , are a sign of a strong relationship , but can make people unpopular with their friends			0
@entity83 , a professor of marketing at @entity85 in @entity86 , said : ' @entity88 are a growing trend that i think have far more social value than selfies			1
' here , prime minister @entity149 takes an usie with locals during campaigning for the local election in @entity153 , northwest @entity154 in march , @entity117 said pope @entity119 ( pictured ) with visitors at the @entity121 last year ' could possibly be the first chronicled celebrity usie ' dr @entity156 , of the @entity157 in @entity158 , found that people tended to think their friends were in happier relationships when they first started posting pictures together , or referred to each other in relationship statuses on social networks			1
' the take home message is that others will assume you are in a good relationship if you post relfies , change your status to ' in a relationship with … ' , and talk about your relationship on @entity173 , ' he wrote			0
' in addition , people viewing your profile are pretty accurate in their ratings of your relationship			0
if you are in a strong relationship , viewers can pick that up from your @entity173 profile			0
' however , there is some danger in getting too schmoopie about your relationship on @entity173 ; although your friends will think your relationship is going well , they will like you less			0
' the relfie , or ' relationship selfie ' can quickly become annoying for friends , researchers have warned - but is a sign of a strong relationship .			0

the photo taken at the @entity15 by @entity16 is perhaps the most famous example of an usie
