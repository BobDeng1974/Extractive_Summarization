detective superintendent @entity101 , of @entity220 , said : ' without a doubt mr @entity0 went to great lengths to hide the body to make sure that we never found @entity2			1
he made every attempt to frustrate the subsequent police inquiry			2
' @entity0 received a number of injuries to his hands during the attack , mr @entity101 said , and explained those away to friends by telling them he had been chased through woods by a group of people			2
but he went on to give numerous varied accounts of how he obtained those injuries			0
' what he said then to what he said in interview and what he 's subsequently then said in his defence statement it becomes clear that @entity0 is a habitual liar , ' mr @entity101 said			0
it is not known if the injuries on @entity0 ' hands happened as a result of mrs @entity2 trying to fight him off			1
mr @entity101 added : ' the only person who knows what happened in that wood at the moment is @entity0 and to what extent @entity2 fought back , it 's only him that knows			1

in the @entity73 period of 2009 and 2010 he was employed as a casual worker at @entity15 , at the same time as mrs @entity2 worked there , but there was no evidence to suggest they ever met or that she became a target of his during that time			1
@entity0 had a good upbringing in @entity264 , @entity65			0
his parents were a professional couple and his brother was at university			0
it was only following the break - up of his relationship with a local girl , with whom he had a young son , that his family relations became strained because of concerns over childcare and he found himself homeless			2
he registered himself as homeless and it was this that led detectives to him when they searched the register after receiving a description of a man in the woods around the time of the murder who looked dishevelled and unkempt			0
almost immediately after mrs @entity2 's murder , @entity0 got a job as a waiter at the @entity292 in @entity188 , @entity65 , and was able to stay in the flat above the premises			1
it was there that he was arrested for mrs @entity2 's murder and subsequently charged .			1
