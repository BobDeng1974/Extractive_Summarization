by @entity0 the scale of the divisiveness on the @entity4 tour which ultimately cost @entity5 his international career extended beyond a push for the removal of team director @entity9			1
while @entity5 ’s barely disguised contempt for @entity14 ’s management and methods boiled over during a players - only meeting after the fourth test in @entity19 that left most of the squad flabbergasted , sources claim he had also had captain @entity21 and vice-captain @entity22 in his sights for much of the tour			1
@entity5 has never hidden his dislike and distrust of @entity9 ’s approach , so there was shock but little surprise when he tore into the coach at that meeting , forcing @entity21 and @entity22 to intervene more than once			1
in happier times : @entity5 wanted @entity9 replaced as @entity35 's team director and also had @entity21 , left , and @entity22 in his sights relationship broken : @entity5 never hide his dislike for @entity9 's methods during his time as @entity35 team director but it is now emerging that as well as wanting @entity9 replaced as coach , @entity5 had grave misgivings about @entity21 ’s captaincy and tactical approach and he further thought @entity22 was not worth his place — and he made those views known to various colleagues on the tour			1
furthermore , it is known he had little time for batting coach @entity52			0
there is debate over his motivation for pursuing an agenda of wholesale change from within the dressing room			2
his supporters suggest it was based on genuine and objective concern for the future prospects of the team			2
others say he never got over losing the captaincy in the fiasco which resulted in his sacking and that of coach @entity70 in the winter of 2008 - 09 , and that he saw the @entity4 loss as an opportunity to grab it back			2
fall out : @entity5 lost the captaincy in the fiasco which resulted in his sacking and that of coach @entity70 in the winter of 2008 - 09 whatever lies behind his thinking , the disappointment felt by @entity21 and @entity80 is all the more acute because @entity5 is aware that , were it not for them , his international career might have ended in 2012 after the @entity84 storm that enveloped @entity86 cricket in crisis			1
then , when @entity5 was dropped for the final test against @entity91 after it emerged he had sent derogatory text messages to ‘ close friends ’ inside the opposition dressing room about @entity9 and @entity96 , then skipper , certain powerful voices were dead set on ending @entity5 ’s seven - year @entity99 career			2
had @entity96 carried on , it may have spelled the end for him			0
history : @entity5 sent derogatory text messages to ' close friends ' in the @entity91 side about @entity9 and former @entity35 captain @entity96 but , after @entity5 said it was ‘ tough being me in the @entity35 dressing room ’ in an extraordinary press conference following his brilliant hundred at @entity110 , prior extended the hand of friendship			1
the wicketkeeper was the only player to call his troubled team - mate in an effort to move forward			0
later , even though @entity5 was not at first selected for the tour to @entity118 , new captain cook sought to canvass the opinions of his senior players and then made decisive moves to bring him back into the fold			2
flower was uncertain , but felt he had to support his new skipper			0
@entity5 repaid them with a wonderful century in the second test in @entity127 and the uneasy peace held through last summer ’s 3 - 0 @entity4 victory , until it all ended in tears this winter			0
as the fallout from the 5 - 0 defeat spreads , @entity9 has relinquished day - to - day control of the @entity35 team — he will continue to exert an influence in his new role with the @entity138 — and prior ended the series on the sidelines			1
in addition , observers with no axe to grind have proposed @entity21 should quit the captaincy to concentrate on his batting			2
tough tour : @entity21 , left , and @entity9 presided over a humiliating whitewash in the ashes against @entity150 on saturday , @entity151 not only called @entity9 ’s style domineering , but also accused @entity21 of letting things ‘ stand still ’ as regards team planning and insisted that simply blaming @entity5 was ‘ just not right ’			1
‘ it ’s when you ’re not doing well that you need team spirit , and i have n’t seen too many people coming out and accepting responsibility for this one , ’ said @entity151 , the captain when @entity35 were whitewashed by @entity150 in 2006 - 07			2
‘ the group do n’t seem to be a group any more			0
they ’ve got one player who can take the blame and the rest of them want to go about their business and let him take the fall			0
‘ it ’s not that we could n’t bowl them out , not that we could n’t score runs , not that we got outplayed — it ’s @entity5 ’s fault			0
i ’d have more respect for some of the senior players if they held their hands up , rather than letting it all get heaped on one bloke			0
’ backing : @entity151 , right , has defended @entity5 and says he ca n't take all the blame for @entity35 's woe in @entity150 yet senior figures consider @entity5 ’s actions undermined team spirit from the start			1
they point out that his silence over an all - out attack on @entity21 by his close friend and ally @entity191 before the series , when the @entity193 called for the captain to be replaced by @entity5 , and @entity5 ’s disinclination to offer public support thereafter left more questions than answers			1
and his refusal to counter the assault on @entity21 by his no 1 cheerleader , @entity201 , who tweeted ‘ @entity203 ’ at every available opportunity , did little to help team unity			2
when @entity5 hijacked the team meeting in @entity19 — called with @entity9 ’s support and aimed at urging players to take more responsibility for their performances — he tried to press for a regime change			1
that was seen as final confirmation that he had no qualms about undermining team unity already rocked by the trauma of @entity217 ’s early departure and the continuing struggles on the field			0
when , before making the decision to sack @entity5 last week , new managing director @entity220 took soundings from all concerned , he was left in no doubt of the general belief that @entity5 ’s actions and behaviour concerning @entity9 , @entity21 and @entity22 were not merely divisive , but bordered on a deliberate attempt to undermine the leadership of the group			1
early blow : @entity35 batsman @entity217 came back home early because of a stress - related illness indeed , any lingering support from within has been blown away following @entity201 ’s efforts to drag prior into the row over that meeting in @entity19 , and what some see as wilful twisting of @entity22 ’s words in order to misrepresent his position over @entity14 and demonstrate his support for @entity5			1
@entity201 accused prior of being a hypocrite to his five million @entity246 followers , claiming the wicketkeeper had ‘ stabbed [ @entity5 ] in the back ’ by failing to support the batsman when @entity220 was taking soundings over his future , even though he had backed him in the meeting			1
@entity5 had initially complained he did not want to attend because it would cut into ‘ family time ’ , then used the opportunity to launch a broadside on @entity14			0
@entity201 stated @entity22 had joined in , attacked @entity14 ’s dictatorial style and said : ‘ @entity14			0
’ support : @entity201 is @entity5 's no 1 cheerleader and has been championing his cause on @entity246 prior , enraged by @entity201 ’s attempt to enlist his support for @entity5 ’s @entity265 stance , responded by pointing out that his words were intended to underline that the team had to face their own failure without blaming the management or @entity9			1
@entity5 misjudged the mood of the meeting when @entity22 and @entity21 attempted to steer the discussion back to the issue of personal responsibility			1
what did not help @entity5 ’s cause was his ‘ that ’s the way i play ’ batting in the first three @entity278			0
the deal has always been that if you take his runs , you take the rest			0
but the manner of his dismissals in five of the first six innings in @entity150 led @entity286 to savage him and former @entity35 batsman @entity287 to remark ‘ his absolute insistence to try to dominate at all costs , to show his ego at all costs , cost @entity35 dear ’			2
criticism : former @entity35 cricketer @entity286 was not impressed with @entity5 's batting @entity295 those who have followed @entity5 ’s extraordinary journey from a young @entity300 off - spinner who found his prospects for advancement limited in his home country , to one of the most destructive batsmen in the world , have witnessed just how disruptive he can be ... without trying			1
what happens when he is trying can be devastating , as @entity70 , @entity96 and many others have discovered to their cost			0
one man who saw it coming was @entity313 , @entity314 ’s director of cricket , who fell out with him when they were at @entity316			0
familiar story : @entity5 fell out with @entity314 's director of cricket @entity313 while he was at the club at the time @entity5 was reintegrated after of @entity84 , @entity313 said : ‘ he ’s @entity35 best player but i think it ’s a short - term fix ... somewhere down the line it will go wrong again			1
if @entity35 beat @entity150 [ in the summer of 2013 ] , they ’ll be ok and they ’ll get through the ashes in the winter			0
but in a year , i ’m afraid , you can see it all kicking off again			0
’ the only thing wrong about that forecast was the timescale			0
the @entity333 led the way with news that @entity5 ’s @entity35 career was over after the humiliating 5 - 0 @entity4 defeat in @entity150			2
cricket writer @entity0 revealed three weeks ago that the top brass had run out of patience with @entity35 ’s record run scorer			0
and @entity341 summed up the mood in the team over @entity5 , who was unhappy with @entity21 and @entity22			1

@entity5 did not just want to get *rid* of team director @entity9
batsman had issues with @entity35 captain @entity21 and @entity22
misgivings over @entity21 's captaincy and did n't think prior was worth his place
supporters say he was pursuing agenda for the future of the team
critics believe he was trying to get revenge for his sacking as captain
