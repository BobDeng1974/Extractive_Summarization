@entity1 striker @entity0 is in contention to make his @entity4 debut on friday night against @entity5 in their @entity7 qualifier			1
the 21 - year - old has been in sparkling form for @entity1 this season - having netted 29 goals in all competitions so far			1
1966 @entity14 winner sir @entity13 believes @entity0 has what it takes to shine on the international stage for @entity19 's side			1
1966 @entity14 winner sir @entity13 ( left ) believes @entity0 has what it takes to be an @entity4 star thrill of a debut i ’ll never forget what it was like getting that first call			1
it was the start of 1966 and @entity31 ’s manager @entity30 took me aside in training and said i had been picked for a game against @entity34			2
it was real elation even if i did n’t play			2
i made my debut a month later against @entity38			2
why this is relevant to @entity0 is the confidence you get from reaching that level			1
that could be a very big factor for this lad			2
@entity13 made his debut for @entity4 in a 1 - 0 friendly win against @entity38 in february 1966 confidence self - belief is a huge thing in football , especially for strikers			1
when i got my @entity4 debut i felt 10 feet tall			1
with the season @entity0 has had , and now this selection , his extra confidence means we should be able to expect even more from him			1
the challenge will be doing it again next season			2
people will analyse how you mark him , how you stop him			2
it will be very interesting to see how he reacts to that			2
i would say he is not vulnerable to that , when i think about his character			2
@entity0 could make his @entity4 debut against @entity5 in their @entity7 qualifier on friday night at @entity72 character what i like is that @entity0 has not had it all his own way - he had to fight to get in , he had to go out on loan			1
it has not been smooth			0
i was n’t a world - class player coming through but we have seen lots of players who have become more successful than those around them with more talent			0
dedication and attitude are such key traits and @entity0 has those in abundance			1
i saw him receive an award recently at a charity dinner			0
you could see how level - headed he is			0
@entity0 has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the @entity1 first - team this season the ingredients looking at @entity0 , i am reminded of a speech i heard years ago by @entity97			1
he was talking about @entity99 ’s @entity98 and said : ‘ @entity98 is deceptive - he is much slower than you think he is			0
’ i liken that to @entity0			1
he is deceptive - he is much better than you think he is			0
@entity0 is a bit like @entity105 , the @entity106 and @entity38 forward			1
on your first glance at @entity105 , he does n’t look like a footballer			0
he has his socks down his shins , looks ungainly			0
but he ’s a fantastic player			0
i liken @entity0 to that type of all - round player			1
@entity13 believes @entity0 's deceptive style of play can be compared to @entity38 forward @entity105 ( right ) strengths i like how he shoots			1
he is almost always on target			0
he can score from distance or a tap - in - and that is a whole different skill			0
he can anticipate and poach			0
he strikes the ball cleanly and that is why he is often on target			0
it is also why he is so good at keeping the ball low			0
how often do you see him shoot over ? the other thing is they come from all directions			0
he will still be unpredictable next year because there is not one set place he shoots from			0
@entity0 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity1 team - mate @entity137 during @entity4 training on thursday it helps that he is so comfortable with each foot , unlike a lot of players today			1
more than that , @entity0 has football intelligence which is especially important for strikers			1
his awareness of space on the pitch is very good			0
throw in the fact he is very , very good in the air , strong physically and willing to press and defend , and you have a striker to be excited about			0
he is a team player			0
i will save my excitement until the end of next season to see if he has done it again - look at @entity158 - but @entity0 looks very good			1
@entity13 is impressed with @entity0 's ( right ) ability to shoot off either foot as well as his ability in the air weaknesses i do n’t think he has electric pace			1
but i did n’t have that and it did n’t do me any harm			0
he is not slow - he can still run at players - but it is not electric pace			0
@entity171 was like that and i think @entity0 has @entity171 ’s intelligence			1
despite a lack of pace , @entity171 made 51 appearances for @entity4 - scoring 11 goals sir @entity13 is encouraging communities to nominate a local @entity178 for the @entity180 & @entity179			2
nominations in @entity182 close on march 27 ; to make your nomination , go to : @entity185			2

@entity4 host @entity5 in their @entity7 qualifier on friday night
@entity1 forward @entity0 could make his @entity4 debut at @entity72
