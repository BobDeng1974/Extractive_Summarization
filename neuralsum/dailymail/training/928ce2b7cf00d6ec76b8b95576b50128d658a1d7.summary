by @entity0 there have been countless @entity3 6 concepts that show how designers would like the handset to look , but not necessarily how it will look			0
a @entity8 industrial product design student has addressed this balance by creating a series of mockups based on leaked specifications , images of dummy models and current handsets			1
all the elements were modelled from scratch , and any dimensions that have n’t been leaked have been based on the @entity19			1
the mockups ( pictured ) were created by @entity8 design student @entity20			1
they are based on leaked and rumoured specifications , and @entity20 modelled every part from scratch , including the ports and cameras @entity28 's @entity27 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity30 ' version			1
up until august last year , @entity31 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity35 , at 0.24 inches ( 6.18 millimetres )			0
this was then replaced by the @entity37 at just 0.23 inches ( 5.75 millimetres )			0
by comparison , @entity28 ’s current @entity19 has a depth of 0.3 inches ( 7.6 millimetres ) , while the @entity40 is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches ( 7.5 millimetres )			2
@entity42 's @entity41 is 0.32 inches ( 8.1 millimetres ) thick , while the @entity44 m9 is 0.37 inches ( 9.4 millimetres )			0
the concepts are the work of @entity8 project design student @entity20 , and show a sleek , thin and rounded design			1
the home button is shown with a metal ring , expected to be @entity28 's next - generation fingerprint scanner , and the rear of the case features black stripes along the top and the bottom			1
@entity20 told @entity56 : ‘ the antenna stripes are 1mm wide - significantly thinner than on the dummy models - and have a ‘ black glass ’ idea to them , similar to what the @entity19 has on the back			1
‘ i modelled every part , from scratch , [ including the ] headphone jack , cameras , lightning port , and all the buttons			1
‘ as far as i can tell , the dimensions are correct down to the millimetre			0
' i used the dimensions of the ‘ leaked ’ @entity3 schematics , and the dummy dimensions			2
’ the design ( pictured ) resembles the rounded edges of @entity28 's @entity78			1
any dimensions in @entity20 's mockups that have n't been leaked were based on the current @entity19 rumours suggest the @entity3 will be 6mm ( 0.2 inches ) thick , which is smaller than the @entity82 ( 0.3 inches ) design			1
this has led to rumours the handset will be known as the @entity87			2
the antenna stripes on @entity20 's mockups ( pictured ) are 1mm wide - thinner than what 's appeared on the leaked dummy models any dimensions that have n’t been leaked or hinted at were designed as they appear on the @entity19			1
@entity20 's home button is shown with a metal ring ( pictured ) expected to be @entity28 's next - generation fingerprint scanner this includes the lightning port , headphone jack and volume rocker , which @entity20 thinks are unlikely to change			1
' there are some parts where i had to take a good guess of course , ' continued @entity20			0
‘ it 's hard to model the @entity3 6 without exact dimensions for everything			0
' overall , it 's extremely close to the dummy model and probably the real thing			0
’ rumours suggest @entity28 is working on two versions of different sizes , with one being 4.7 inches ( 11.9cm ) diagonally , the same size as the @entity44			0
a larger version is also expected to be released , measuring 5.5 inches ( 14cm ) - slightly larger than @entity42 's 5.1 - inch @entity41			0
a recent selection of leaked images revealed changes to button placements			0
the power button , usually found on the top of @entity122 for example , appeared to be located on the side of the device			0
the volume and lock buttons , however , will seemingly remain where they are			0
latest images of @entity28 's supposed @entity3 were leaked last month ( shown ) , showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images			1
the power button , typically found on the top of previous @entity122 , appears to have been moved to the side , making the device easier to operate with one hand the rumoured back of @entity28 ’s new @entity3 6 ( pictured left ) looks similar to that of the @entity44 ( pictured right ) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges			2
it also suggests @entity28 may have found a way to make its ' @entity145 ' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an @entity19 it is believed the @entity3 6 , which some think will go by the name of the @entity30 , will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display , and an @entity152 processor			2
the @entity19 , by comparison , has a 1136 x 640 resolution , and the @entity156 chip			0
these hardware changes will be in addition to the features of @entity28 's latest @entity161 software , unveiled last month , which include health monitors and smart notifications .			2

the mockups were created by industrial product design student @entity20
they are based on leaked and rumoured specifications and dummy models
@entity20 modelled every part from scratch , including the ports and cameras
dimensions that have n’t been leaked were instead based on the @entity19
@entity28 's device , *dubbed* @entity87 , should be on sale by *september*
