by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity2 owner @entity1 has given his unequivocal backing to beleaguered manager @entity4 , whose two assistants have been suspended pending an investigation amid allegations of bullying			1
the @entity10 billionaire praised @entity4 ’s ‘ total loyalty and commitment ’ to the club and acknowledged that the loss of @entity12 and @entity13 could have proved difficult for the @entity14			1
but the removal of two people who were intrinsic to @entity4 ’s success at @entity21 and have formed part of his coaching team for the past eight years , dating back to @entity24 and @entity25 , does leave him in a difficult position and desperate for a quick improvement in results			1
they point to a record 10 home defeats as evidence that the club have stagnated			2
should that become 11 on saturday when @entity53 visit , then there is likely to be open revolt in the stands			0
@entity4 , 44 , relied on @entity56 but has now turned to club legend @entity57 , who has been promoted from development coach , and goalkeeper @entity59 , who in february stated that @entity2 ‘ want me out of the door ’			1
the 37 - year - old @entity61 international has two years left on his contract but has not played a league game for the club since august 2012			2
@entity12 was said to have cultivated a ‘ poisonous ’ atmosphere with his methods during training			1
several players are believed to have grievances , with @entity71 and @entity72 particularly upset at an incident in the week preceding the @entity75 match			2
upset : @entity71 was thought to have been affected by an incident during training disappointed : @entity72 was left out against @entity75 but returned in the defeat at @entity30 the defender started his career at @entity81 in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at @entity21			2
during nine years at @entity83 he played 370 times for the club , including in the famous win over @entity87			2
he is in the @entity88			0
he then moved on to @entity89 and @entity90 and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became @entity4 's assistant at @entity25 in 2008 before following the @entity94 to @entity21 and then to @entity45			1
it is understood allegations of bullying by @entity12 and @entity13 have been made by others who work at @entity2 , forcing chief executive @entity99 to act			1
the move was supported by @entity4 , whose relationship with @entity12 had broken down beyond repair and came to a head during the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity30 , @entity2 ’s fourth consecutive loss			1
the players were told about the changes at training on tuesday and the following session laid on by @entity57 was said to be the ‘ best in ages ’			1
@entity1 said : ‘ our manager has been faced with some unexpected issues that could have very easily set the club back			2
' in watching him handle matters , along with our chief exec , i ’ve seen total loyalty and commitment to @entity2 , while @entity57 , a @entity2 man through and through , has repeatedly stepped up to support the club regardless of the ask			1
showdown : @entity2 chief executive @entity99 ( right ) met with @entity4 at the training ground lots to think about : @entity2 lost their fourth @entity38 game on the spin at @entity30 on saturday @entity13 did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at @entity129 in 1998 , where he was football and community officer			1
he then moved to @entity133 ( where he joined up with @entity12 ) but his big break came when he became head of youth at @entity24 in 2006 under @entity4			1
he followed @entity4 to @entity25 , where he became football operations manager , and was part of the team that moved to @entity21 and then @entity2			1
‘ @entity59 , too , has been unhesitating in answering the manager ’s call			1
i could n’t ask for more from people who are up for this challenge and the very real obstacles we have to overcome , as is everyone at the club			2
’ @entity2 lie 14th in the @entity38 with 34 points , four above the drop zone , and are fighting relegation for a second season under @entity4			1
fans were promised an exciting brand of football when he replaced @entity155			0
‘ if they lose against @entity53 , the atmosphere will turn , ’ said @entity156 , who runs the @entity158 fan site and is a director at @entity160			0
‘ this now is almost a trial			0
i ca n’t see the fans standing for him if we end up on anything below 40 points			0
his position may become untenable			0
’ walking into trrouble ? fans have turned on @entity4 , increasing the chances he could be leaving can we be of any assistance ? @entity57 ( left ) and @entity59 will help @entity4 4 @entity2 have lost four @entity38 games in a row			1
they last lost five on the spin in january 2001			0
1 @entity178 has managed only one shot on target in eight appearances			0
0 @entity72 has not scored or assisted a goal in any of his last eight @entity38 games			0
despite this he tops @entity2 ’s assists list this season with five			2
@entity187 have scored a paltry 42 goals in 36 @entity38 home games under manager @entity4			2
@entity191 six starts and no goals this season			0
he cost £ 2m from @entity196 in 2013			0
@entity197 signed from @entity198 for £ 500,000 in 2012 , has made only four starts			0
@entity200 ( above ) cost £ 2m from @entity201 but struggled to adapt			0
@entity202 likely to leave in the summer after £ 2.5m move from @entity204 last june			0
@entity205 yet to make a start this season			0
striker cost £ 1.2m from @entity209 last june .			0
