no wonder they are smiling			2
on the sunny seafront at @entity4 , two @entity2 migrants look forward to a new life after a hazardous journey across the @entity7 hidden in a refrigerated lorry and almost suffocating to death			1
now , eight days after arriving , they live at the taxpayers ’ expense in a @entity13 holiday hotel with a swimming pool and champagne on offer while @entity18 officials search for @entity20 homes for them			1
‘ we are so happy and our only worry is whether we will need coats for the cold weather in your winter , ’ says @entity21 , 30 , in his good @entity22 as he puts his arm round his friend , @entity25 , aged 20			1
the @entity18 officials say we will stay in this hotel , where we get three meals a day and nice rooms , until october 6 and then i go to @entity43 and @entity32 is to live in @entity44			1
is @entity43 colder than @entity44 ? ’ he produces a bunch of official papers in a brown envelope with a @entity18 stamp on the top to show me he is telling the truth			1
the two migrants were among a group of 24 @entity54 men and women who paid £ 400 each to trafficking agents for the final leg of their journey to the @entity20 – a place in a refrigerated lorry which arrived in @entity61 on a ferry from @entity63 , eight days ago			1
they were discovered after seven hours in the truck when the foreign driver parked near @entity61			2
the migrants , frightened of being suffocated , had begun banging on the sides of the lorry			1
a mechanic from a nearby workshop broke the security seal to the vehicle and found them gasping for breath			2
the migrants get three meal a day and comfortable rooms at @entity78 with views of the @entity80 of @entity4 they survived a hazardous journey across the @entity7 hidden in a refrigerated lorry and almost suffocating to death the incident , filmed on mobile phones , made national headlines			1
it also raised questions over how hundreds of migrants from impoverished @entity2 and beleaguered @entity91 countries still slip over the 22 miles of water from @entity63 each month despite @entity18 promises that @entity20 border controls at the @entity95 port have been tightened up			1
this week , as 1,500 migrants waited in @entity63 to try their chance of smuggling themselves to the @entity20 , the government pledged £ 4million a year until 2017 to counter organised trafficking gangs			2
crucially , new technology at the port to look inside refrigerated lorries – the vehicles where migrants appear to routinely escape detection – is expected to be introduced too			1
back in @entity4 , holiday makers at the @entity107 hotel where @entity109 and @entity32 stay voiced disapproval over the new arrivals			1
back in @entity4 , holiday makers at the @entity107 hotel where the asylum seekers stay voiced disapproval over the new arrivals around 130 migrants moved there by coach on tuesday from the overcrowded @entity118 ’ hotel near @entity119 , which was dubbed @entity120 by locals and guests when they found 500 asylum seekers squashed into 98 rooms last weekend			1
now the @entity125 is being called @entity126			2
it will cost taxpayers £ 72,000 to keep the migrants from @entity119 there for two weeks in £ 40 - a - night rooms			0
as @entity4 councillor @entity137 said : ‘ a lot of residents and business people are disgusted the migrants have been sprung on us			0
they ’re worried about tourism			0
‘ we do n’t want this to become another @entity63			0
’ @entity139 , a 52 - year - old from @entity141 , who was last week enjoying a holiday at the @entity107 with her daughter @entity143 , 27 , said : ‘ it makes us feel uncomfortable			1
we do n’t know who they are and whether they have criminal records			0
there ’s old people staying here who are petrified			0
’ another holidaymaker , a @entity154 user , @entity153 from @entity155 , left a review on thursday of the experience at the hotel after being surprised to meet migrants there			2
she wrote : ‘ we booked the weekend for our wedding anniversary , but as soon as we checked in we could see it was a lovely hotel , so we booked an extra night			2
however on the evening of our extra night , 130 asylum seekers arrived			1
‘ it worried the life out of me , with all that ’s going on we did n’t know if we were in any danger			0
‘ we did n’t sleep , we went back to our room early as we were worried about our belongings and even worried about our car			0
‘ if my husband had n’t had two glasses of wine with dinner we would [ have ] left that evening			0
’ however – oblivious to the hostility – the migrants , mainly from @entity54 but also from the @entity91 troublespots , are delighted with their new abode			0
both @entity180 and @entity32 were housed temporarily at other hotels near @entity61 after being rescued from the lorry			1
they were then sent to @entity4 earlier this week to join the 130 from @entity119 at the @entity125			0
the migrants i met are claiming asylum and will be given free housing plus cash benefits of £ 150 a month while the @entity18 decides if they can stay in the @entity20 , a process which could take years			1
the @entity191 driver of the refrigerated lorry carrying the @entity54 group , which included nine children , has been charged with assisting the entry of illegals and is due in court next week			1
the @entity54 are @entity198 who flee a dictatorship where every male over 18 is forced to serve in the @entity201 – although @entity180 claims he was forced into service at the age of 13			0
they start their journey to the west by paying trafficking agents to guide them in lorry convoys over the @entity208 desert to @entity209 and , from there , by boat to @entity211			2
a trickle of @entity54 smuggling themselves to the @entity20 is now a torrent			0
their asylum claims are often granted because of the oppression in their country			2
as i sit with @entity180 on a harbour bench outside the @entity222 , he explains : ‘ i was made to serve in the @entity201 from when i was a young teenager			0
it is a frightening country and so we want to get to @entity22			0
‘ my family paid £ 1,200 to a trafficking agent put me on a lorry across the @entity208 to the @entity209 seaport of @entity229			1
then they paid £ 1,400 to another agent for my place on a small boat to the @entity211 coastline			2
‘ i made my way to @entity236 and stayed with a group of @entity54 there to rest			0
i then took a train through the @entity211 - @entity95 border to @entity240 in the south of @entity95 , before getting others to @entity243 and @entity63			0
‘ i was in @entity63 for seven weeks trying to get on a lorry day and night			1
i hid my @entity198 cross under my t - shirt because i was afraid i would be attacked by the @entity248 migrants there			0
’ he continued as the voice of @entity251 ’s @entity80 rang out from a nearby cafe : ‘ a week ago i got my chance			0
my family paid more money to an agent for my place on the refrigerated lorry			1
’ the migrants say they were around seven hours inside the lorry before the doors opened and they could breathe properly again			2
‘ we were desperate , gasping for air , ’ says @entity180			0
then he gives another broad grin before adding : ‘ but , at last i was in @entity22			0

@entity21 , 30 , and @entity32 , 20 , are living in a @entity13 holiday hotel
asylum seekers travelled across the channel hidden in a refrigerated lorry
the pair now get three meals a day paid for them at @entity78
