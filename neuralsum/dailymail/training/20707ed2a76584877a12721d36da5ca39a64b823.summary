@entity0 and @entity1 could team up in their own backyard to form a highly - charged doubles partnership for @entity5 against the @entity6 in next week 's @entity8 first round in @entity9			1
the less celebrated @entity1 sibling was recalled to the @entity12 side for the first time since 2011 when the squad was announced on tuesday morning for the prestigious fixture starting a week on friday at the @entity16			2
there is every likelihood that he and his brother will be thrown into the doubles to tackle the world number one twins @entity22 and @entity24 , although captain @entity25 has also included @entity12 doubles number two @entity26 as another option			1
@entity29 is set to play in all three of @entity5 's @entity8 matches against @entity6 next month @entity1 could be partnered in the doubles alongside his brother @entity31 for the clash at the @entity33 @entity1 has earned his place having reviving his career in the last two years after it had slipped into the doldrums			1
he is now ranked the world 's 31st doubles player following victory in the @entity41 @entity40 and reaching the final in @entity43 earlier this month with @entity46 foil @entity44			1
the presence of him and @entity0 in the team promises to make it an emotional three days , as this will be the first time they have played in @entity50 since his younger brother won the @entity54 title			0
the world number three is likely to have to take on the responsibility of playing three days in a row , although that could depend on the outcome of the first two singles matches			0
this will be the first tie in the elite @entity8 knockout held in the @entity63 since 2002 , with the winners going through to face either @entity65 or @entity66 in the last eight			0
the doubles could decide the tie unless @entity69 can produce one of his outstanding @entity8 performances and upset one of the higher ranked @entity6 as second singles player			1
@entity75 youngster @entity74 will be the travelling reserve			0
@entity1 ( right ) has been recalled to the @entity12 side for the first time since 2011 after an upturn in form ' from a selection point of view we 've been able to choose our strongest possible team which is spearheaded by @entity29 who is significantly ahead of where he was 12 months ago , ' said @entity25			1
' the tie will be a huge deal for him personally as he returns to play in @entity50 for the first time since winning @entity54 in 2013			0
in @entity69 we have somebody who has already proven himself against the @entity6 @entity8 team , and i 'd back him again to put in another excellent performance after some consistent recent form has seen him on the verge of cracking the top 100 for the first time			0
' i 've selected our top two doubles players in @entity31 and @entity26 , and again they 've showed real consistency this year to earn their place in the team			2
as a group , all the guys deserve this opportunity			0
' the @entity6 team , captained by @entity104 , is expected to be made up of world no 20 @entity106 , no 44 @entity107 and the world champion @entity24 brothers @entity5 captain @entity25 will be hoping @entity69 ( right ) can repeat his @entity8 heroics vs @entity6			2

@entity29 will be competing in the singles with @entity69
@entity1 is set to play in the doubles too - alongside brother @entity31
doubles *specialist* @entity117 *completes* the four - man line - up
