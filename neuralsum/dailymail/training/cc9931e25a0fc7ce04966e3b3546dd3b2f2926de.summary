by @entity0 a dramatic supermoon is set to accompany this year ’s perseid meteor shower , one of the most anticipated events on the skywatcher ’s calendar			1
given a dark , clear sky in a normal year , it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in august			0
but this year the @entity10 have a bright shining rival - a larger and brighter moon			1
this year the streaking balls of fire may be outshone by the supermoon , which occurs when the full moon coincides with its closest point to @entity22			1
however when the @entity10 peak on tuesday they should still be visible on sunday , two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak , the moon will become full			1
coincidentally , it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the @entity22 , known as ' perigee '			2
the supermoon will be up to 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than other full moons during the year			2
on one level , this is bad news , according to dr @entity36 from the @entity38 space agency @entity40 ’s @entity39			0
' @entity42 glare wipes out the black - velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors , and sharply reduces counts , ' he said			0
a supermoon occurs when the moon is both ' full ' and at its closest point to @entity22			1
astronomers call this phenomenon a ' perigee moon , ' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to @entity22 each year			1
@entity55 marks the closest point a body reaches as it orbits around its host object such as @entity22 , while apogee marks the farthest point from its parent body			1
almost every orbit has an apogee and perigee because orbits tend to be elliptical rather than perfectly circular , so even @entity22 has an apogee and perigee around the sun. but the debris stream left by comet @entity70 , which produces the @entity10 , is wide so the shooting stars could make an appearance well before the moon becomes full			1
dr @entity36 added that the @entity10 were also ' rich in fireballs as bright as @entity77 or @entity78 ' that would remain visible despite the moon ’s glare			2
a study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the @entity10 to be the undisputed ' fireball champion ' of meteor showers			0
' we see more fireballs from @entity70 than any other parent comet , ' said dr @entity36			0
@entity88 , director of the @entity91 ’s ( @entity90 ) meteor section , also urged skywatchers to stay optimistic			0
' the @entity10 are rich in bright meteors and so many @entity10 will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background , ' he said , writing on the @entity90 ’s website			0
' you can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the @entity103 / @entity102 / @entity101 area			0
' if possible , keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building			0
' the @entity10 will be visible from @entity38 and @entity107 from saturday to wednesday			1
the meteors can also be viewed from elsewhere in the northern hemisphere			1
in this picture a @entity10 meteor is seen shooting above an aurora in the night sky in @entity114 , @entity115 on 12 august 2008 astronomers observe a perigee moon in @entity118 on 12 july			2
on sunday , two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak , the moon will become full			1
coincidentally , it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the @entity22 , making it 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than other full moons during the year he pointed out that at this time of year the moon is relatively close to the horizon , leaving much of the sky dark			1
mr @entity88 also suggested looking at an area of sky 20 to 30 degrees away from the @entity10 radiant - the spot near the constellation of @entity135 that the meteors appear to fly out from			0
every 133 years , comet @entity70 swings through the inner solar system leaving behind a trail of dust			0
when the @entity22 passes through , the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 miles ( 225 km ) per hour and burn up in streaking flashes of light , creating the spectacle known as the @entity10			2
the best time to see the meteors is between saturday and wednesday , with activity peaking on tuesday			2
an unusually bright full supermoon was also seen on 12 july , and another is due to appear on 9 september			0
but the supermoon of sunday promises to be the most dramatic since this is when the moon will be at its closest point to the @entity22 all year			1
at perigee , the moon is around 31,000 miles ( 50,000 km ) closer than when it is furthest away from @entity22			0
supermoons occur relatively often , with four to six occurring on average every year , but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather .			0

yearly meteor shower event could be ruined by brighter and larger moon
the @entity10 will be visible from @entity38 and @entity107 from saturday to wednesday
the meteors can also be viewed from elsewhere in the northern hemisphere
but this year the streaking balls of fire may be outshone by the supermoon
@entity172 occurs when full moon coincides with its closest point to @entity22
however when the @entity10 peak on tuesday they should still be visible
