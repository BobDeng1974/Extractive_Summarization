death : @entity1 , pictured , was found dead in her hospital bed by her own daughter on a routine visit a pensioner 's daughter found her mother dead in a hospital bed as she arrived for a routine visit - and medics had not yet noticed			1
@entity1 was admitted to @entity11 with a chest infection following a fall last march at her home nearby in @entity14 , @entity15			1
but her daughter @entity16 said that when she paid a visit six days later , she discovered her mother 's body ' still warm ' in the hospital bed			1
mrs @entity16 raised the alarm only to discover a ' @entity22 ' notice had been put on her mother 's notes without her consent , despite mrs @entity1 having a history of depression			1
according to mrs @entity16 , nurses said they had checked on her mother half an hour before she arrived for the routine visit at 2.30pm on april 3 , and the 88 - year - old was alive			2
but she hit out at the hospital over its care of her mother , who died of pneumonia and frailty			1
' she deserved better care , ' the school dinner lady told the @entity37			2
' the hospitals are bursting at the seams , so i have tried to make allowances for that			1
but she was failed , in some aspects , at the most basic levels			0
' i arrived on the ward and had to tell them that she was dead			2
' they felt her pulse , and they said " no i 'm sorry , she 's gone "			0
i said , " can nothing be done ? " - and they said " no , because she 's agreed to this @entity22 "			0
it was the first i heard of it			0
if she had been so poorly to discuss a @entity22 with her , why on earth had n't they called a member of the family ? ' @entity62 had n't even been mentioned to me			0
we had seen her the previous day and not one of us thought that this could have happened within 24 hours			0
instead of being seen by the critical team , the nursing staff washed her hair			2
' the hospital has apologised to mrs @entity16 after she lodged a catalogue of claims , including that nurses miscalculated the pensioner 's ' early warning score ' showing how ill she was			2
had they calculated it correctly , claimed mrs @entity16 , it would have led to an immediate call to the critical outreach team and a junior doctor			0
justice : the pensioner 's daughter @entity16 ( pictured ) said : ' the hospitals are bursting at the seams , so i have tried to make allowances for that			1
but she was failed , in some aspects , at the most basic levels ' and she said nurses failed to check on aspects of the grandmother 's care for more than seven hours , instead of every 30 minutes , and failed to give mrs @entity1 her anti-anxiety medication @entity98 for three days			1
@entity11 apologised to mrs @entity16 in a letter , which admits her mother was ' let down ' , and have mounted an investigation into the full circumstances of the incident			1
she added : ' if they had observed my mum like they should , and alerted the critical team like they should , it 's possible she would n't have died that day			2
' observations were missed , medication was missed , documentation was missed and communication was awful			0
' on the surface her care appeared ok , but when i looked at the medical notes they told a different story			0
' they let @entity121 down , they let me down , they let the family down			0
so i think they looked at her and thought " well , she 's 88 "			2
i think that does go on a lot in hospitals today			2
' tales : @entity11 made headlines just days ago for not realising a pensioner was virtually blind mrs @entity1 was admitted to the hospital by paramedics on march 28 following a fall at her home			1
she had visited her gp the day before with a small chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics			1
she died on april 3 from pneumonia and frailty			1
mrs @entity16 added : ' my mum had a long history of depression and anxiety			0
mrs @entity1 ' daughter said : ' i do n't want another family to go through this ' ' without my knowledge her medication had n't been given to her for three days			1
we had been warned by her gp that this could lead to serious side - effects			0
' alone , feeling ill and depressed , i doubt she had the mental capacity to make such a weighty decision regarding a " @entity22 " notice herself			0
' i do n't want another family to go through this			0
i could have looked after her better at home			0
' @entity158 , the hospital 's managing director , said : ' we take the safety and care of all of our patients very seriously and have undertaken a detailed investigation into the care mrs @entity1 received			1
' i would like to apologise to mrs @entity16 and would welcome an opportunity to meet with her to discuss any aspect of her mother 's care during her time here			0
' the case was revealed days after it emerged a pensioner was found dehydrated and groping for food at the same hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind			2
@entity11 also apologised for its care of 82 - year - old @entity177 , who was admitted following a fall in june			1
staff were told the pensioner 's eyes could only pick out light and dark , said her daughter @entity183 , but put food and medicine out of her reach			1
mrs @entity177 later suffered a serious infection which has impeded her brain function and left her in a care home for the rest of her life .			0
