by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 23:20 est , 16 february 2013 you perhaps would n’t expect the brash tv presenter @entity2 to live in a such an elegant house , with calm neutral shades throughout and beautifully co-ordinating fittings			1
but @entity2 and his wife @entity7 ’s home in @entity8 is exactly that : a tranquil oasis in a busy part of @entity11			1
with a secluded walled garden at the back , their property has given them both privacy and a great space for entertaining for 14 years			1
but now @entity2 – whose new series of @entity20 , which sees him digging around in @entity22 mud unearthing relics from the past , will be shown on the @entity23 next month – is ready to move on			0
absolute gem : tv presenter @entity2 is selling his £ 3.5million @entity26 home in @entity11 's @entity8 he and @entity7 have already found a bigger house nearby that better suits them and their two children – @entity31 , 12 , and @entity32 , nine			1
their current home is on the market for £ 3.5 million			1
houses in their street were built as show homes for the @entity39 , which drew hordes of people to @entity11 from around the @entity43			1
at that time , much of the area was still fields , while @entity47 station – now the busiest in the country – had n’t even opened			0
the road forms part of a conservation area , with @entity52 close by			0
most houses are semi-detached , though some , like the @entity55 ’ , are detached			0
time to go : @entity2 and @entity57 are leaving their home after 14 years almost all the architectural styles of @entity11 are here – gothic gables , classical designs , @entity63 – and they also feature bay windows			1
@entity2 , 46 , can thank @entity7 for the tasteful renovation of their four - storey gem			0
the lower - ground floor has a family room and a large kitchen / dining room with limestone steps leading to the garden			2
on the upper - ground floor , the main sitting room has two sets of @entity77 windows opening on to a balcony , again with steps to the garden , and a second reception room			2
there ’s plenty of space for four bedrooms on the two top floors , although the @entity55 use the first floor for a master bedroom suite with a large dressing room , and the top floor for the children ’s bedrooms and a bathroom			2
@entity7 , 42 , used the skills she learned on a course with interior designer @entity95 to complete the project , and clearly no expense was spared			0
her favourite room , the kitchen , was redesigned to make the most of the link with the garden			2
the back wall was replaced with glass folding doors , and a limestone terrace for @entity106 leads to steps up to the garden			2
the clean lines of the contemporary kitchen , with its smooth @entity111 worktops and large central island , were chosen by @entity7 , as were the bespoke wooden shutters on all the other floors			2
the house is a hymn to harmony , with polished wood floors , limestone fireplaces and @entity121 bathroom fittings			1
underfloor heating , @entity124 lighting with multiple settings and surround - sound systems on three floors add to the high - spec finish			0
the @entity129 knew they were stretching their budget when they bought the house for £ 900,000 in 1999 , but @entity7 wanted it more than any of the others they saw			1
@entity8 has since moved dramatically upmarket , with demand from the so - called @entity138 set – families searching for good - sized houses , decent schools and green spaces			1
@entity143 : the first floor master bedroom in the property , built in the mid- 19th century space to breathe : the airy front room has a view of the secluded back garden property website @entity150 says a detached home in @entity8 averages £ 1.6 million , but estate agent @entity154 gives the @entity55 ’ a top - end guide price of £ 3.5 million due to its position and high standard of the interior			1
the house – the childhood home of broadcaster @entity162 – is painted in neutral shades for good reason , says @entity7			1
‘ you need somewhere calm if you live with my husband , ’ she laughs			0
‘ i like things to be simple but of really good quality			0
i loved the course with @entity95 because it made sense of everything i ’d always been drawn to – smooth shapes , symmetry and neutral shades			0
’ so be warned , @entity2 : do n’t spoil the look by trampling that @entity22 mud indoors			0
