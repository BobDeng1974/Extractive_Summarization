trappers place their lures at night			0
early the next morning , they return for their grisly harvest , ripping the terrified birds from the fine - mesh ‘ mist ’ nets or glue - covered branches , often leaving the entangled feet behind , then killing them with a cocktail stick or a penknife to the throat			1
many will be used in the dish @entity54 , in which the boiled or fried birds are eaten whole , save for the beak			2
@entity4 regards the meal as ‘ natural viagra ’			2
trapping takes place during the autumn and spring migrations , and the illicit and sickening trade is worth £ 12 million a year			2
in his letter , prince @entity0 writes : ‘ disturbingly , autumn mist - netting levels are now much higher on this @entity9 soil than in the @entity4 , with mist netting in the @entity72 estimated to have increased 180 per cent since 2002			1
’ the trapping , made illegal in 1974 , is sophisticated and large - scale			2

the glue sticks , coated with a tacky lime solution , are placed in the tree branches , and vertical mist nets erected between the rows of acacia bushes which entangle not just the blackcaps , but all flying creatures , from robins to song thrushes and even small owls and other birds of prey			1
@entity0 calls for the acacia groves and their irrigation system to be ripped out			2

‘ in particular , to ask you to have the infrastructure which permits this illegal slaughter ( planted avenues of invasive acacia ) to be removed from the @entity137 - administered land there by the start of the autumn migration period in september			0
‘ this would not only at a stroke save hundreds of thousands of birds being killed illegally on @entity9 soil , but would also prevent significant profits from flowing into the pockets of the serious organised criminals who control this barbaric practice			1
’ he says the bird haul includes ‘ many species which are much - loved by the @entity9 public , such as robins , song thrushes and barn owls ’			0
@entity155 , @entity4 representative of @entity156 , said : ‘ an @entity3 training ground has been turned over to wildlife crime			1
