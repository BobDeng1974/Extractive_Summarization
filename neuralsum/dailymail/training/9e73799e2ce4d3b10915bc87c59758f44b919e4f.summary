inventions from the @entity3 brother ’s flying machine to @entity5 's @entity4 are some of the most instantly recognisable in the world and define entire eras			1
now a group of artists have sourced the patents for the game - changing gadgets and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints to celebrate the iconic designs			1
they include inventions as simple as the @entity20 brick and other more complex designs , such as the first typewriter or a @entity24 motorcycle			1
a group of artists have sourced the patents for iconic objects and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints			1
they include the print for @entity33 's @entity32 ( pictured ) which together with the later @entity34 , sold almost 119 million units across the world the designs were the idea of the @entity40 - based art company @entity39 , whose works feature not only the intricate designs of the objects , but also the history behind each			1
the company hopes that in a world where inventions that are becoming ever more complex , the images will stand as a reminder of the thinking that went into each of the classic designs			1
the reworked blueprints include some of our favourite toys such as the @entity20 brick , which was awarded it ’s for @entity61 patent for a ‘ toy building brick ’ in 1961 – and has now expired – meaning that anyone can copy it			1
another design featuring in the series includes the first @entity4 , which was released on october 23 , 2001 , just over eight months after @entity67 was released			0
it had just @entity69 of storage and because it was expensive and only compatible with @entity73 , sales were pretty slow until 2004 world - changing inventions such as the gun and first flying machine are also included in the series of blueprints			1
one of them ( pictured ) shows the firing mechanism of the revolver handgun , which was patented on december 6 , 1881 since the @entity83 company began making its interlocking bricks in 1949 , around 560 billion have been produced			2
the blueprints also feature another childhood favourite - the @entity87 - which was patented in 1947			1
the toy was invented by naval engineer @entity89 in 1943 and was a sell - out hit when it launched for $ 1 two years later			2
in 60 years it has sold over 300 million units and has been used as a toy , teaching tool , wartime radio antenna and even as a physics experiment by @entity98			0
blueprints of the @entity100 go some way as to explain its fiendish difficulty to solve			2

the method for stringing the racket ( pictured left ) was patented in 1907 and the design of boxing gloves ( pictured right ) was patented in 1923 in more modern times , objects such as the vinyl record , the @entity4 and @entity32 are easily recognisable and are part of the series of artwork based on their original blueprints			1

the first @entity4 was released on october 23 , 2001 , just over eight months after @entity67 was released with @entity257 of storage but because it was expensive and only compatible with @entity73 , sales were pretty slow until 2004			0
since then there have been six generations of @entity4 , the largest of which has @entity261 of storage , as well as more compact @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 and the @entity266 , which has a touch screen much like the @entity268			0

the motorcycles ( pictured ) are known for the tradition of heavy customisation that gave rise to the ' chopper ' style of motorcycle it is hard to believe that @entity5 's first personal compute , which was patented in 1983 , ( pictured left ) led to the development of the company 's super slim offerings like the @entity311 and @entity312 today			0
the blueprint for an elaborate cash register with beautiful art nouveau style detailing is pictured on the right			0

the designs were the idea of the @entity40 - based art company @entity39 , whose works feature not the intricate designs of the objects and their history
the company hopes that in a world where inventions that are becoming ever more complex , the images will stand as a reminder of the thinking that went into each of the classic designs
