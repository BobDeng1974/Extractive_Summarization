by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 3 september 2013 a driver has been unwittingly given a £ 60 fine for driving in a bus lane when the actual offender was the council ’s own roadsweeper			2
@entity7 , 32 , was stunned to receive the penalty notice from @entity9 despite having never visited the city			1
the fine was sent to mr @entity7 ’s house , almost 100 miles away in @entity13 , @entity14 , along with a photograph of the offending vehicle			1
@entity18 's wrong : @entity7 was unwittingly fined £ 60 for driving in a bus lane in @entity26 - a city he had never visited before - after the council mixed up the ' e ' in his number plate with ' b ' in the offending vehicle 's plates is it ' b ' or ' e ' ? the council included this image of the offending vehicle , its number plate in clear view but it is not mr @entity7 's @entity38 kit car , rather it is a council roadsweeper in the bus lane but the photo revealed a @entity9 roadsweeper in the bus lane driven by a council worker wearing a fluorescent jacket on august 21			1
on closer inspection mr @entity7 , who drives a @entity38 kit car – not a roadsweeper , noticed that his number plate was exactly the same as the roadsweeper ’s bar one letter , the council mixing up a ‘ b ’ for an ‘ e ’			1
but when @entity7 contacted the authority to point out their mistake , he was stunned to be told by council workers that he must still go through the authority ’s official statutory complaints procedure before the fine could be overturned			1
he was also told the penalty could rise up to £ 90 if he failed to pay the fine within 28 days and threatened with possible legal action if it still was n’t paid after that			2
' bureaucratic nightmare ' : mr @entity7 contacted the council about the fine ( right ) after noticing that the offending roadsweeper ( left ) had a very similar number plate , but was told that he still had to go through the authority 's official complaints procedure			1
the council have since cancelled the fine bus lane bumble : this intersection on the @entity77 in @entity78 is where the bus lane camera caught the roadsweeper mr @entity7 said today : ‘ it ’s just been a bureaucratic nightmare and it makes you wonder if it has happened before			1
‘ it makes you want to know if it ’s all automated or if someone looks at what they are actually sending out			0
‘ i think i might write back on the form “ have a look on the back ” so they look and see their own sweeper			0
‘ when i first got it i just thought “ oh my god , where have i been ? ” i thought i was going to have to pay the fine			2
then i realised i have never been to @entity26 in my life , let alone driven there			0
‘ when i turned over the form i just laughed , there was the picture of this huge sweeper just sweeping the curb			0
‘ they must have just mistaken the @entity108 in my car ’s registration for the b in the sweepers , that ’s the difference , other than them being completely different cars			0
should check their records : mr @entity7 , who has owned the £ 17,000 @entity38 kit car for three months , said he has felt angry but not ca n't help but laugh at the mix up ‘ i ’m almost tempted to wait and take this to court and see what they say when it all gets to court			1
‘ i ’ve felt every emotion going - at first i was angry , then confused and now i ca n’t help but laugh about it			0
‘ to send a picture of their own vehicle , which they will have records of is brilliant			0
‘ they should really check those records from time to time			0
’ mr @entity7 has owned the £ 17,000 kit car for three months			1
he said : ‘ i ’m happy with my kit car for now but perhaps i could avoid any potential parking and speeding tickets in future if i bought a council road sweeper			2
’ the letter from @entity9 informed mr @entity7 of his @entity139 under the @entity141			1
it read : ‘ the alleged contravention has been detected and recorded by an @entity145 device			0
‘ @entity9 having reason therefore to believe that a penalty charge notice is payable , serves this @entity148 on you , as the person appearing to the @entity9 to be the owner of the vehicle of the person liable to pay the penalty charge			2
’ @entity9 today apologised for the embarrassing error and agreed to cancel the penalty notice			2
a spokesperson said : ' the ticket has now been cancelled and we apologise for the confusion			0
this is the first time this kind of mistake has happened			0
