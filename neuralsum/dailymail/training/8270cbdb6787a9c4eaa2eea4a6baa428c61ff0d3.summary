@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
the boy needs help as a manager you 're dealing with problems and situations with your players day in day out			2
many of them you keep out of the public eye if possible			2
@entity23 has quite clearly got some major issues going on in his life which he and @entity37 have to face up to			1
he fell into @entity26 ? that 's rubbish			1
admit you 've got issues			1
sit down and deal with them			2
his rabid , animal - type behaviour is unacceptable			0
it reminds me a couple of weeks ago when i was on holiday and a little boy had his ice cream snatched out of his hand by his older brother			0
loose cannon : @entity23 should make the most of the help available through the @entity33 and @entity34 video i did n't mean to bite - @entity23 the little kid chomped his older brother 's arm and just walked off			1
maybe @entity23 had his ice cream nicked off him when he was a little kid ! whatever is the reason for his biting habit , he needs sort it out			1
@entity60 is bad , but it could be worse @entity62 player @entity61 was accused of biting an opponent in the unmentionables last year			1
it was in a @entity67 league game between @entity68 and @entity69			0
i was reading about it in a newspaper while on holiday			0
@entity61 denied it , but he was handed an eight - match ban			0
ouch : @entity61 was accused of biting an oppenent 's genitals during an @entity62 match banned : @entity61 denied the offence but was suspended for eight matches after the incident saints stripped at the end of last season it looked like a very exciting time to be a @entity88 supporter , player or member of staff			1
now new manager @entity92 is faced with a very tough task			0
with @entity96 leaving six months ago , @entity95 gone to @entity37 , @entity97 to @entity98 , with @entity99 set for @entity37 and @entity100 looking on his way to @entity102 , those core , key players will be very difficult to replace			1
the owner , @entity104 , will be absolutely delighted to have banked more than £ 60m			0
but for @entity88 fans it is worrying times for them after an incredible ride over the last few years			1
i fear , unless @entity92 works miracles , they wo n't be far off relegation next season			2
summer sale : @entity97 is among the @entity88 stars to secure a move away from the club @entity118 woes the @entity118 is an amazing event , but with @entity120 out it really does gnash me off			1
it 's just not the same when we 're not in it anymore and all the players have come home			2
who will win it ? i think it 'll be the @entity128			2
they are disciplined , honest , mobile , athletic , can defend set plays , are strong in the air and they have a team spirit that will continue to grind out results			0
a lot of people are backing @entity139 , and i 'm sure they will go close , but at some point @entity141 will make a massive mistake – he always does – and that 'll be it for them			0
always deliver : @entity147 has backed @entity148 to go on and win the @entity118 my week ... my last week on holiday has been spent constantly on the phone , trying to find players through their agents to put a decent team together at @entity6			1
we 're starting pre-season on thursday and all my focus is trying to build a team , like a jigsaw puzzle			0
i 'm trying to put together all the ingredients for success			0
when signing players , you 're trying to find speed , experience , good character , reliability , a few personalities , a few on their way out , a couple on their way down			0
as @entity173 once said to me , you ca n't have 11 choir boys in your team .			0

@entity37 striker @entity23 must accept that he needs to face up to his issues
an @entity62 player was last year accused of biting an opponent 's genitals
@entity88 will need to work miracles to *overcome* their summer *exodus*
@entity148 should be *favourites* to win the @entity118
