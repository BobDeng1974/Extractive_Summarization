nothing will have gladdened @entity1 more this season than what happened in the aftermath of @entity6 ’s third and final goal against @entity7 on @entity8			1
no sooner had @entity9 expertly headed in @entity11 ’s pinpoint diagonal cross than the @entity12 turned to his team - mate , pointed at him in gratitude before they embraced like old friends			1
it has n't always been like that			2
sir @entity19 and @entity20 could n't get two of the most talented players in the @entity23 to put aside their egos , and felt forced to take sides			1
they would go on to win the match 3 - 1 @entity32 connects firmly with a header after getting free of @entity7 defender @entity34 ( left ) goalkeeper @entity35 can only watch on as @entity32 's well - directed header flies beyond him @entity37 has succeeded in repairing the sometimes fractious relationship between @entity32 and @entity11 @entity19 was a @entity32 man to the extent that @entity11 ended up hellbent on trying to move to @entity40			1
@entity20 was a @entity11 man , leaving @entity32 ’s friends angry that their striker was being over-trained in spite of being vulnerable to injuries			1
as he prepares to enter a cauldron at @entity46 on sunday — @entity37 spurned @entity28 earlier this year once the opportunity arose at @entity48 — the @entity12 can be proud of his biggest achievement at his new club , making @entity32 and @entity11 live up to the @entity7 part of their club ’s name			1
@entity11 has been given the captain ’s armband that @entity32 coveted , @entity9 has the main centre - forward ’s position that @entity11 coveted			1
and it has n’t seemed to cause any ill - feeling			2
against @entity7 , @entity32 peeled wide from his no 9 berth to give @entity11 the space to run from deep and score twice in the first half			1
@entity11 then unselfishly planted a ball on top of @entity32 ’s head to set up a 3 - 1 victory			1
@entity67 ( left ) posted this picture on @entity69 of himself and @entity70 on the way to @entity28 @entity11 scored twice in the comfortable @entity7 victory on @entity8 as they cemented third in the league @entity7 are 10 points behind leaders @entity40 and seven behind @entity77 in the @entity23 table the relationship between @entity32 and @entity11 has n't always been easy , especially last season remember , this was a pairing who passed to each other only once in the entire 90 minutes against @entity84 in the @entity86 first leg last season — and that was from a kick - off			1
they did n't even celebrate goals together at times			0
the word @entity37 uses often to try and explain the camaraderie inside the @entity7 camp after seven wins and a draw in their past eight matches is ‘ social ’			1
it means a set of players who are happy to work and play together , only interested on the pitch in benefitting the team rather than themselves			0
‘ the attitude of my players is excellent and they have a very high social standard , ’ says @entity37			1
‘ that is very important because football is a team sport between co-operating human beings			0
you have to be social			0
we have a high social standard in the team			0
' wherever i am in my career , i shall guide and manage the team in a social way of treating each other			0
it is also part of my philosophy			0
i can not explain that in one page , it is a lot of pages			0
if you read my book , it is all in it			0
but things have improved this campaign as @entity7 continue their march up the table @entity37 is hoping to make it eight wins from nine matches when @entity7 travel to @entity28 on sunday @entity40 december 28 @entity136 ( a ) january 1 @entity28 ( a ) january 10 @entity7 ( @entity137 ) january 17 @entity138 ( a ) january 31 @entity77 ( @entity137 ) february 7 @entity139 ( a ) @entity77 december 28 @entity140 ( @entity137 ) january 1 @entity141 ( @entity137 ) january 10 @entity142 ( a ) january 18 @entity143 ( @entity137 ) january 31 @entity40 ( a ) february 7 @entity144 ( @entity137 ) @entity6 december 28 @entity28 ( a ) january 1 @entity145 ( a ) january 11 @entity136 ( @entity137 ) january 17 @entity146 ( a ) january 31 @entity147 ( @entity137 ) february 8 @entity148 ( a ) ‘ @entity11 and @entity32 are very social players			1
they have trained together already for six months this season so it is normal they shall improve			2
when we are half a year further on , it shall improve even more			0
that ’s why we have training			0
’ the simplicity of the message makes you wonder why @entity19 and @entity20 could not pull off the same trick , particularly when the pair ’s children attend the same school , to help their off - field relationship			1
@entity37 has managed some of the biggest names in football with @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , so he has made solving one or two personal issues at @entity7 look a doddle			1
@entity11 is happy to play in midfield for the team , @entity32 respects @entity11 as his captain			1
@entity32 says of his relationship with the manager : ‘ i worked with @entity37 for two years with @entity171 so i knew how he trained			1
i knew exactly what to expect			0
' he warned me after the @entity181 that it would take time for me to get there ( top form ) but i would be very very fit			0
@entity11 has thrived in the captaincy role and also in a deeper midfield position during recent matches @entity32 and @entity37 forged a close relationship when the latter coached the @entity12 national team @entity32 headed straight for @entity37 after scoring his wonderful diving header against @entity192 ‘ i am feeling very well now , which i was n’t at the start of the season			1
every single player , when you are working under @entity37 , is balancing on the edge — physically and mentally you are concentrating every single minute of the day			1
' he expects us to think about football just before we go to bed as well			0
but i love it and it is a very good way			0
‘ straight away when he got the job , i realised it would be very intense years but great years as well , because of the way he trains			0
every session he puts on there is always an idea and he explains himself well			0
’ former player @entity214 noted in friday ’s match programme that @entity7 seem a happier club			2
@entity37 agrees : ‘ i think so , i think when you win six times in a row , and you draw , and you win again , then the spirit is fantastic			2
@entity37 , pictured handing out presents to @entity7 fans on @entity8 , was linked with the @entity28 job instead , @entity28 appointed @entity224 , who joined from @entity136 in the summer ' i think there is happiness in the club because we are together working for one goal			1
we have a very good communication between all the employees in @entity6 and that is very important			2
‘ and we can celebrate parties , @entity236 parties , and that is also important			0
we can work but we can also celebrate and that is very good			0
’ of course , in - form @entity28 will provide a sterner test than an under - strength @entity7 did			1
@entity28 fans will remember the club thought @entity37 was going to be their new boss until @entity7 fluttered their eyelids while he was at his holiday home in @entity246 and prompted a u-turn			1
@entity37 is expecting a hot reception but it does not bother him			2
‘ i can not change that			0
i do n’t have any influence on it so i wo n’t make any trouble with them ( @entity28 fans )			1
i ’ve managed with this kind of thing at a lot of clubs			0
' we have to play and speak about what is happening now			0
now it is ( @entity224 ) @entity224 , the new manager , and i am the new manager of @entity6			2
’ @entity28 celebrate after @entity264 's goal secured a 2 - 1 @entity8 win at @entity147 @entity266 had handed @entity28 the lead inside the first minute at the @entity268 of greater concern will be @entity28 ’s run of four wins in a row under @entity224 , who eventually filled the vacancy from @entity136			1
in particular , @entity264 has been a major influence , making those who thought he would be too lightweight for the @entity23 look foolish			2
‘ that theory is rubbish , always rubbish , ’ said @entity37			2
‘ when you have high standards you can play in the @entity23			2
when you ’re good on the ball , you can play , and @entity264 is good on the ball			0
it does n’t matter when you are less physical , not so tall or wide			0
' did you see @entity283 for us against @entity7 ? two great assists			2
i think the selection of @entity28 is a high - standard selection so it ’s normal they ’re doing well			2
’ @entity290 ’s pelvic strain means he is likely to miss out along with @entity291 and @entity292			0
@entity37 is also opposed having to play 48 hours after @entity7 ’s previous game , something @entity295 and @entity296 do not allow in their competitions			1
even so , as long as he has @entity32 and @entity11 singing from the same hymn - sheet , @entity37 will fancy his side ’s chances at the club he could have joined			1
@entity290 is set to miss the trip to @entity46 with a pelvic injury			0

@entity6 travel to @entity28 in the @entity23 on sunday
@entity1 will be hoping to make it eight wins from nine matches
the @entity12 coach has succeeded in uniting @entity11 and @entity9 this season
former bosses sir @entity19 and @entity20 had to pick a favourite
but @entity37 has the two *frontmen* working in perfect *harmony*
it was shown by the celebrations after @entity7 's third goal against @entity7 on @entity8
