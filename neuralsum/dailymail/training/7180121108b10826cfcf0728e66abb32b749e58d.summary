a boy who was left blind in one eye after years of neglect by his mother and her partner was so desperate he once scrawled ‘ help me ’ on a wall at home			1
but despite the vulnerable child ’s plea , the authorities repeatedly missed opportunities to intervene			0
the 12 - year - old was left in squalor with his baby sister while his mother , who lives on benefits , and her boyfriend were ‘ too busy ’ to notice his failing health			0
social workers and police found squalid conditions in the family 's home and the boy had written ' save me ' on one wall in an apparent cry for help the 12 - year - old boy was kept in a filthy , fly - infested house in @entity32 , near @entity33 , @entity34 @entity35 and @entity36 were jailed last month for neglect after @entity39 's son went blind in one eye @entity35 and @entity36 , both 34 , were jailed for child cruelty last month for allowing the children to live in appalling , fly - infested conditions			1
but a report has revealed that the wretchedness of the youngsters ’ lives had been flagged up on numerous occasions by school staff and health workers as far back as 2007 – and was not acted on			2
the pair were finally removed from their home in @entity32 , @entity34 , last year , when a social worker noticed the words ‘ help me ’ written on a wall outside the boy ’s bedroom			1
@entity39 admitted to a social worker that her son had written the message when officials first paid a visit to the property			0
the unnamed boy developed a cataract in one eye after his parents failed to take him to hospital appointments that could have saved his sight			0
he had also been walking with a limp after developing arthritis from living in the filthy and mouldy property , and was forced to look after his two - year - old sister			0
the report into the case stated that worries were first raised about the boy , now 12 , when he was six years old the missed opportunities in the case emerged after a @entity79 was called into the boy 's treatment the report , compiled by a social worker tasked with investigating the case , revealed that a series of chances to help the children were missed			1
issues about the boy ’s cleanliness and attendance were first raised in 2007 by his primary school , but social services decided not to intervene			1
hospital consultant dr @entity94 warned in 2009 that the boy ’s failure to attend appointments could leave him permanently disabled but social services again failed to visit			1
they finally acted when a school nurse went to the property in 2010 and found the child in a mouse - infested home with no heating or hot water			0
but a subsequent visit by council staff determined that conditions had significantly improved and the case was closed			0
fears were raised by dr @entity111 again after the child moved to a different property in september 2011			0
but when school staff said they had no further concerns , welfare officers decided not to carry out an assessment			1
following yet another warning from the consultant , social workers visited the home eight months later – but declared it acceptable without even looking at the children ’s rooms			1
it was not until the intervention of a gp last year that officials grasped the full horror of the child ’s health problems			0
photographs taken during a third and final inspection of the properties where the boy lived show the conditions photographs taken by inspectors show the appalling state of the family home a serious case review has already been launched by the @entity142 to look at the incident			2
@entity144 , @entity145 mp for @entity146 , said : ‘ this has been a tragic situation for this young boy and it is clear that there needs to be a full and detailed inquiry into why he was let down			2
’ @entity154 said the case was closed following improvements in the child ’s home life and school attendance .			2

repeated concerns raised about boy 's *hygiene* by *doctors* and school staff
social services visited house but did not look at children 's bedrooms
they declared home clean on two visits , one eight months after alarm raised
youngster , who wrote messages on the wall , later went blind in one eye
