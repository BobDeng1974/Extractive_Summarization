by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 18 october 2013 a man whose dog bit a postman has been asked to pay nearly £ 70,000 of legal fees after a row over the incident ended up in court			0
after postman @entity8 was bitten by pointer - setter cross @entity9 as he did his rounds in @entity12 , @entity13 , he took on lawyers who offered dog owner @entity15 , 64 , the chance to settle out of court for £ 6,000			1
when mr @entity15 contested it , saying his dog only bit the @entity22 worker because he hit it with his satchel , the dispute ended in a court battle which the dog owner ultimately lost			1
' i 'm a victim of compensation culture ' : dog owner @entity15 , 64 , has been asked to pay legal fees of £ 68,000 now he has been sent a bill by the postman 's solicitor demanding he pay £ 68,538.02 in legal fees arising from the case around the bite , which the dog owner 's lawyer says caused just a ' minor cut '			1
mr @entity15 , a landlord , now fears his home may be repossessed , and says he is victim of a growing trend in @entity40 to bring no - win , no - fee personal injury lawsuits			1
he said : ' this [ bill ] highlights everything that is wrong with the no - win , no - fee compensation culture			1
' mr @entity8 was bitten by the pet dog in april 2008 as he made his rounds in the village near @entity49			2
nearly a year later , the postman instructed @entity52 - based solicitors @entity53 to pursue his grievance against the dog owner , and after two years of legal wrangling , mr @entity15 was told the postman would agree to settle out of court for £ 2,000 compensation plus legal fees of £ 4,061.02			1
however , disputes over whether the dog belonged to mr race or his ex-partner , and differing accounts over what took place when the postman was bitten , resulted in the case going before @entity69 in january this year			0
centre of the storm : @entity72 , who bit postman @entity8 in april 2008 the judge ruled in mr @entity8 ’s favour and he was awarded £ 1,500 compensation , which mr race paid			2
but when he was subsequently presented with a bill of costs totalling £ 68,532.02 , mr @entity15 said he felt he had no choice but to appeal			2
the amount , which is still up for negotiation and must be approved by a judge , covers the cost of @entity53 's solicitor fees , including the additional money awarded for winning the case , as well as the fees of barristers , medical experts , witnesses and other administrative and legal expenses incurred during the proceedings			0
@entity94 , of @entity95 , said : ' mr @entity8 was subject to a distressing dog attack and , as such , he is entitled to compensation			0
' from the outset , @entity53 has sought a swift and reasonable settlement to the case including mediation			0
' against the explicit advice from his solicitor to accept the court ’s original decision , mr @entity15 remained determined to continue the dispute which caused additional delay and associated costs			0
' earlier this week mr @entity15 lost his appeal at the @entity110 in @entity111			0
now his solicitor says he fears he could be asked to pay even more , and fears losing his house			0
lawyer @entity113 , of @entity114 in @entity115 , said : ' mr @entity15 made the decision to appeal based on @entity53 ’s fees and the fact he did n’t agree with all that was said , ' he said			2
' we did n’t charge mr race to represent him at the appeal as we felt he was a victim of the no - win - no - fee compensation culture			1
