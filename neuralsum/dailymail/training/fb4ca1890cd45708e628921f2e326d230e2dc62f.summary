a disgraced property tycoon and a hedge fund trader who cashed in on the credit crunch are both in the @entity4			2
ex-convict @entity5 – the great survivor of the @entity7 share - trading scandal – is made a cbe			1
and there is a knighthood for @entity12 donor @entity11 , who has given more than £ 500,000 to party coffers since 2003			1
his firm , @entity14 , made a staggering £ 100million from the financial crash by betting that the price of @entity18 shares would fall and also made millions in a matter of days by predicting the likely slide of other banking shares			2
controversial : ex-convict @entity5 , pictured left with wife @entity22 , is appointed @entity8 while @entity12 donor @entity11 , right , is to be knighted the honours sparked a cross-party war of words , with @entity26 accusing @entity27 of cronyism , but @entity29 insisting that the prime minister had nothing to do with the decisions			1
@entity33 , @entity26 's shadow cabinet office minister , said : ' @entity27 promised to clean up politics , but in office he has shown he is utterly out of touch with decent @entity38 people			1
he is giving a knighthood to @entity11 , who made millions from the collapse of @entity18 and has given over £ 500,000 to the @entity41			1
' this tells you everything you need to know about the @entity41 ' priorities			2
when millions of families are struggling to get by , it 's the @entity41 ' friends in the @entity49 who get the rewards			2
' a member of the @entity52 , @entity51 , described the knighthood for mr @entity11 as a ' disgrace '			1
the @entity26 mp for @entity56 said : ' the country is sick to death of bankers getting knighthoods from successive governments			2
' it is extraordinary that when there are so many hard working people who have done a lot for this country , it is people who have caused us so many problems that are getting awarded			1
small business owners who went under and people who lost their jobs when @entity18 failed will be extremely angry			1
' a government source stressed that the prime minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours and dismissed any suggestion of impropriety			1
the decision , said the source , was taken by an independent committee in recognition of mr @entity11 's commitment to the arts			1
donating to a political party is not a bar to an honour but the independent committee is made aware of any donations			2
within @entity75 there was anger at @entity26 's decision to try to make political capital out of the issue , not least because former @entity98 boss @entity97 , who has given @entity26 £ 1million , is knighted in today 's list			2
jailed : @entity5 , left , during his time inside @entity101 is the great survivor of the @entity7 share - trading scandal no decision to make : a government source said that the prime minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours a government source said : ' this criticism is pretty rich , coming from a @entity26 government that gave @entity115 a knighthood – they should wind their necks in			1
' others from the business world whose honours might raise eyebrows include @entity123 , founder and chief executive of the online gambling company bet365			1

property tycoon and philanthropist @entity5 , 72 , who was jailed in 1990 for his part in the @entity7 scam , has been honoured for services to charity			1
it is rare for a former prisoner to be bestowed with such an honour			2
indeed , one of his co-defendants , the late @entity143 , was stripped of his knighthood after they were convicted along with two other top @entity49 figures			2
@entity143 , who was spared a 30 - month term because of his poor health , was knighted by the 1973 @entity12 government and had his title taken away by @entity151			1
proud moment : those people on the @entity4 will enjoy a day at @entity154 @entity5 founded @entity155 – now @entity156 – when he was 17 , brought self - service petrol stations to the @entity38 in 1960s and was once the 14th - richest person in @entity38 and worth £ 548million			1
in 1990 he was , with @entity143 , @entity160 and @entity161 , convicted over @entity7 's £ 2.7billion takeover of the @entity164 drinks group distillers			0

asked if @entity5 's conviction had any influence over the decision to award him a @entity8 , a @entity189 spokesman said every nomination for an honour was considered on its own merits			1
other former prisoners to be honoured in the past include footballer @entity198 , who was jailed for drink - driving in 1990 and made an mbe 14 years later			1
and @entity201 was knighted in 2002 , 35 years after being jailed for possessing drugs			0
the sentence was reduced on appeal to a conditional discharge			0
@entity11 , 53 , becomes a @entity206 for services to the arts in today 's honours list			1
during the credit crunch in 2007 and 2008 the activities of ' short sellers ' enraged politicians who were trying to shore up plunging bank shares			0
many observers blamed the practice – based on traders selling stock , allowing the price to fall and then buying it back – for the bailout funded by taxpayers			0
short - sellers were accused of targeting @entity226 owner @entity224 in particular before it was rescued by @entity227 and then the taxpayer			1

delighted : @entity233 , the man who brought @entity234 to @entity38 screens , has been given a knighthood for services to broadcasting @entity233 has the dubious distinction of being the man who brought @entity234 – the epitome of downmarket reality tv – to @entity38 screens			1

while he did not invent the format for @entity234 he was credited with playing a major part in making the show a success			0
during his time at the company the reality series was involved in a number of controversies including showing a couple apparently having sex , albeit under the covers , on @entity283 in 2003			1
