an international consortium of scientists has published a high resolution draft of the barley genome in a move that may hold the key to better beer			1
@entity7 is the second most important crop in @entity10 agriculture and malting barley underpins brewing and pub industries worth some £ 20billion to the @entity10 economy			1
the breakthrough is a critical step towards barley varieties able to fight against cereal crop diseases and cope with the demands of climate change , researchers claim			1
better beers on the way ? scientists have mapped the genome of barley , a key ingredient in beer ' this research will streamline efforts to improve barley production through breeding for improved varieties , ' said professor @entity32 , of @entity34 's @entity33 , who led the research			2
' this could be varieties better able to withstand pests and disease , deal with adverse environmental conditions , or even provide grain better suited for beer and brewing			1
' @entity45 's fourth most important cereal : @entity7 , a close relative of wheat and rye , was first cultivated 15,000 years ago and is vital to agriculture today @entity7 which has been malted is a key ingredient in brewing beer along with hops and yeast			1
the research , published in the journal nature , could also be a boon for the whisky industry while barley is also a major component of animal feed for meat and dairy industries			2
@entity7 is the world 's fourth most important cereal crop , behind maize , rice and wheat			1
first cultivated more than 15,000 years ago , it belongs to the same family as wheat and rye			0
together , they provide about 30 per cent of all calories consumed worldwide			0
beer is the world 's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third-most popular drink overall , after water and tea			0
thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage , beer is produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar			0
the starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains , most commonly malted barley and malted wheat			2
unmalted maize and rice are widely used adjuncts to lighten the flavour because of their lower cost			0
the preparation of beer is called brewing			2
most beer is flavoured with hops , which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative			0
some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the @entity111 included laws regulating beer and beer parlours ; and the hymn to @entity116 , a prayer to the @entity119 goddess of beer , served also as a method of remembering the recipe for beer			0
with a genome almost twice the size of that of humans , determining the sequence of barley dna was a major challenge , researchers said			1
they said the crop plant 's genome contains a large proportion of closely related sequences that are difficult to piece together in a true linear order			1
however by applying various strategies to circumvent these difficulties @entity139 and his team were able to put together a high resolution draft with most of the 32,000 barley genes in linear order			0
their research reveals the functional proportions of the barley genome , giving a detailed analysis of where and when genes are switched on in different tissues at different stages of development			2
this , they hope , will offer researchers a far better understanding of the crop 's immune system			1
' it will accelerate research in barley , and its close relative , wheat , ' professor @entity32 said			0
' armed with this information breeders and scientists will be much better placed to deal with the challenge of effectively addressing the food security agenda under the constraints of a rapidly changing environment			0

@entity7 is the second most important crop in @entity10 agriculture
it underpins brewing and pub industries worth £ *20m* a year to @entity10 economy
the cereal crop has a genome almost twice the size of that of humans
researchers hope their work will lead to disease resistant strains
