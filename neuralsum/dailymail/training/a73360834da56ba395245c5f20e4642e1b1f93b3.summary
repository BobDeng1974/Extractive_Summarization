by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 14:28 est , 20 february 2013 the smallest known planet outside our solar system has been detected by @entity5 's alien - hunting kepler space telescope			1
it is slightly larger than our @entity7 and orbits its host star every 13 days			0
the planet , named @entity11 , has a surface temperature of more than of 400 degrees centigrade , making water , and therefore life , impossible			1
an artist 's conception for the planet @entity11			1
this planet is slightly larger than our own @entity7 and orbits its host star every 13 days			0
it likely has a surface temperature of in excess of 400 deg c ( 700 deg f )			1
owing to its small size and hot surface the planet is very likely rocky with no significant atmosphere , similar to @entity26 in our own solar system			1
the newly discovered planets are located in a system called @entity31 , about 210 light - years from @entity32 in the constellation @entity34			1
the smallest planet , @entity11 , is slightly larger than our moon , measuring about one - third the size of @entity32			1
it is smaller than @entity26 , which made its detection a challenge			0
owing to its tiny size and hot surface , it is very likely rocky with no atmosphere , similar to @entity26 in our own solar system			1
it orbits the @entity50 - like star with two other planets , one slightly larger and the other twice as big as @entity32			0
' even @entity31 can only detect such a tiny world around the brightest stars it observes , ' said @entity54 , a planetary scientist at @entity5 's @entity55			1
' the fact we 've discovered tiny kepler - 37b suggests such little planets are common , and more planetary wonders await as we continue to gather and analyze additional data			0
' kepler - 37b is about 80 percent the size of @entity26 and is the first ' exoplanet ' to be found that is smaller than any in our own solar system			1
discoveries of exoplanets - those that lie outside the @entity27 - have helped to increase our knowledge of planetary systems and have revealed they can look quite dissimilar to ours			0
until recently , researchers had only been able to detect and probe larger exoplanets , and none had been found that are smaller than those seen in the @entity27			1
astronomer @entity77 , a research scientist at the @entity78 , said : ' since the discovery of the first exoplanets , it has been known other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own			0
' until fairly recently , we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution and , since last year , to detect planets that are the size of @entity32 or somewhat smaller			2
' hitherto , no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in the @entity27			2
' here we report a planet significantly smaller than @entity26			2
two of the three planets orbiting @entity31 are smaller than the @entity32 while the third is twice @entity32 's size			1
kepler - 37b is about 80 % the size of @entity26 and is the first exoplanet to be found that is smaller than any planet in our own solar system			1
' this tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the @entity50 - like host star , which we have designated @entity31			1
' owing to its extremely small size , similar to that of the moon , and highly irradiated surface , the planet , @entity31 - 37b , is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water , similar to @entity26			1
' he added : ' although sub-mercury - sized planets are expected from theory and their space - based detection has previously been predicted , our detection of kepler - 37b is remarkable given this transit signal would be detected in the data of fewer than 0.5 % of the stars observed by @entity31			2
' although the detection of one planet can not be used to determine occurrence rates , it does lend weight to the belief planet occurrence increases exponentially with decreasing planet size			0
' the kepler space observatory , named after the 17th century @entity134 astronomer @entity133 , was launched on 7 march 2009 to survey a portion of the @entity136 for @entity32 - size planets that could harbour life			2
in january astronomers used @entity31 's data to estimate " at least 17 billion " such exoplanets reside in our galaxy			2
the research team used data from @entity5 's kepler space telescope , which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes			0
when a planet candidate transits , or passes , in front of the star from the spacecraft 's vantage point , a percentage of light from the star is blocked			0
this causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet 's size relative to its star			0
the size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet 's size accurately			0
to learn more about the properties of the star @entity31 , scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star			1
they probed the interior structure of @entity31 's star just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of @entity32			2
the science is called asteroseismology			0
the sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface			0
the waves cause oscillations that @entity31 observes as a rapid flickering of the star 's brightness			2
like bells in a steeple , small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones			0
the barely discernible , high - frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure			0
this is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. with the very high precision of the @entity31 instrument , astronomers have reached a new milestone			2
' @entity209 - 37 , with a radius just three - quarters of the sun , now is the smallest bell in the asteroseismology steeple , ' @entity5 said .			0

the planet , named @entity11 , has a surface temperature of more than 400 degrees centigrade , making life impossible
discovered by @entity31 telescope
is the first ' exoplanet ' to be found smaller than any in our own solar system
