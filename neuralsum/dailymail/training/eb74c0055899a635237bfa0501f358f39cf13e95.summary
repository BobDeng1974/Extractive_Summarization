by @entity0 known for their chilled - out demeanor and slow pace of life , it will come as no surprise to most people to learn that surfers have poor timekeeping			0
what is more surprising though is how one sportsman made up for his lack of punctuality - by jumping 30 feet off a cliff and into a raging sea after he was late for a compeition			2
this unnamed surfer was spotted by photographer and graphic designer @entity19 as he was capturing images of a surfing competition off of @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24			1
this is the moment a surfer who was late for a competition off of @entity22 , @entity23 , jumped 30 feet off a cliff just in time to catch his heat @entity19 , 65 , said : ' everyone else was watching the surfers out at sea , but then i noticed this guy running along @entity22			1
i watched for quite a while and before each heat the surfers would climb down to the end of @entity22 and make a smaller 10 foot jump			1
' i noticed this guy run down to the end , he was late for his heat			2
i could tell he was anxious so i focused my camera on him and before anyone knew it , he ran and jumped off the cliff			0
' he timed it perfectly and landed just behind the white water and paddled out			0
i never did find out who he was			0
the cliff itself must be 30 foot high and the waves were maybe higher			0
' the unnamed athlete ran along the rocky cliff clutching his board before making the impressive leap , watched by photographer @entity19 he added : ' in my youth i jumped from this rock all the time , but never when the sea was like this			2
' @entity22 is located at the northern point of @entity62 just south of @entity23 as is a world renowned surfing spot			1
the waters are known as @entity66 and it was here that @entity69 developed the modern - day wetsuit and the ' leash ' which attaches a surfer 's board to their leg so it does n't get lost if they fall off			1
the waters off of @entity22 are known as @entity66 and are where @entity69 developed the modern wetsuit and where he lost his eye the bearded businessman also lost his eye while surfing the waters , which lead to him wearing his famous eye patch			1
it is the home of @entity82 and every year for the last three decades it hosts the @entity85 competition in november			0
the lighthouse itself is home to the @entity23 surfing museum which features a collection of rare and vintage surf boards			2
surfing has been present in @entity23 for over 100 years and was introduced by @entity93 who used wooden planks to ride waves , a far cry from today 's carbon fiber boards .			0
