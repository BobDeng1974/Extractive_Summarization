while @entity0 was watching his beloved @entity1 take on @entity2 at @entity3 , @entity4 was tearing through the @entity5 on his quad bike			1
the morning after last week ’s defeat by @entity8 was , according to the @entity10 scrum half , not the time to lock oneself away in the house			1
@entity4 admitted that he faced questions about the result from passers - by and the 26 - year - old is determined to provide answers with a backs - to - the - wall performance against @entity19 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity10 scrum - half @entity4 scored their a try in their @entity24 opening match at home to @entity8 ‘ everyone is entitled to their opinion , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ but i do n’t take too much notice			0
the @entity31 public probably think we are no good any more , but there you are			0
’ the dunes just outside @entity36 have a history with downbeat @entity31 rugby players			0
@entity39 carried out lone fitness training on ‘ the @entity41 ’ - the highest dune in @entity43 - when he was without a club last summer , while @entity45 and @entity46 also used to run along the sands in a previous era			2
‘ i took my quad bike and did a few doughnuts , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i went out and about and i watched my local team play			0
' ' at the end of the day it is a game ; it is a game of rugby			0
we ’ve lost and obviously we ’re bitterly disappointed with that , but personally i did n’t want to keep myself in the house , i wanted to get out			2
you take it on the chin			0
’ if previous results provide any indication , @entity10 should reverse their fortunes at @entity65 on sunday			1
@entity4 ( front ) was ultimately on the losing team though as @entity8 rallied from behind to win 21 - 16 they have won their last seven meetings with @entity19 , including a 51 - 3 thrashing at the @entity71 last year			1
the @entity72 , however , are revitalised under new coach @entity73			0
there were reasons for optimism after their attacking performance against @entity78 last week , while @entity10 courted criticism for their showing against @entity8			1
@entity82 ’s players failed to involve their strike runners and the @entity84 will be demanding more initiative on sunday			2
‘ some of the boys were probably a bit lazy at the weekend ; not getting up off the floor quick enough and areas like that , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ we had six or seven guys - forwards - on the deck and international rugby is all about numbers on your feet ; trying to create something			2
i just felt as a nine , and @entity99 was the same , that we did n’t have anything to work with			0
@entity4 ( centre left ) believes he and his team - mates will be back following their setback ' every time we got the ball we seemed to be trying to get out of danger			1
this week is about not being afraid to shift it and have a go			0
@entity108 has been about getting the boys up off the floor and working hard			0
’ @entity10 were nullified up front and struggled to provide a platform to attack from the set - piece against the @entity114			1
@entity19 do not offer the same levels of power in the scrum , however they will look to target @entity82 ’s side at the line - out			1
@entity10 training has been at full - throttle at the @entity122 of @entity123 and the breakdown is another area to improve			1
‘ @entity8 had a big pack and we did n’t deal with the threats coming over the ball , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ there was one passage of play where @entity133 , who was probably the smallest guy on the pitch , disrupted our ruck when we had a big dent in the phase			0
@entity4 ( centre ) is hoping @entity10 put in a better display when they travel to @entity19 in sunday 's match ' he had no licence to slow that down			1
he should have been cleaned out			0
it ’s about forwards scanning to see whether they need to go to these rucks or whether they can get on their bike and be a threat out wide			0
’ with the @entity150 looming , the @entity31 game plan will come under more scrutiny if it fails to fire this afternoon			2
but @entity82 ’s group have a tendency to perform when the chips are down , and @entity4 is hoping to be stopped for the right reasons on his next trip to @entity157			2
‘ everybody is against us having lost to @entity8 , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ we want to do well not just for ourselves and our families , but for the nation as well			0
we need to repay our fans this week			0
