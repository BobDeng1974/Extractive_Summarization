one man alone is not going to save @entity2 cricket			0
the @entity4 storyline is a good'un , full of rage , intrigue and hypocrisy			1
but the longer it goes on , the less we will be inclined to analyse what really ails our game			0
@entity13 will not win or lose the ashes on the basis of whether @entity4 returns			1
there are n't , after all , many examples of @entity19 series being won by a single player : @entity23 needed @entity24 during @entity25 , @entity22 needed @entity26 in 1981 , @entity21 needed @entity27 in 2013 - 14			0
and a 35 - year - old @entity4 is unlikely to be in any of those categories			1
if he does return , we may – briefly – get more people talking about cricket ; he may produce some magic to belie his age ; critics of @entity35 may feel vindicated ; it will almost certainly be a whole lot of fun			2
@entity4 shows off his latest flamboyant hairstyle on his way to the @entity41 studio on tuesday that 's the best - case scenario			1
but let 's not pretend it would solve much			2
@entity2 cricket has always presided over a deeply imperfect system , one hampered by a fear of revolution			0
occasionally we commission a serious report , which makes us feel progress is being made			0
but entertaining diversions are just as crucial to the psyche of the @entity2 cricket lover : they mean we can go easy on the self - analysis			0
from @entity58 ’s gamesmanship via @entity60 ’s knee through to @entity22 ’s extra-curriculars and @entity4 ’s tweets , our game has always quietly welcomed the glamorous , scurrilous sideshow , the tabloid tittle - tattle to balance out broadsheet sobriety			1
yet if the game is reduced over the coming months to a string of will - he - wo n’t - he bulletins about the future of a player who has , at best , two years left at the highest level , then we will be doing the game a disservice			0
( i hope @entity4 proves me wrong			1
if he returns to international cricket , i hope he scores lots more test hundreds and gives us all something to cheer about			0
the point of this article is not to pick on @entity4			1
) @entity4 is gunning for an @entity13 recall after his exile from the side , but turns 35 in the summer the batsman has enjoyed some stellar achievements with @entity13 , such as here after the 2005 ashes win @entity4 's antics entertain the public just as @entity22 's extra-curricular activities once did			1
here the all - rounder was pictured dressed as a rabbit next to team - mate @entity92 in @entity93 in 1986 what should concern @entity2 cricket right now is how one of the best - resourced teams in the world spent the @entity99 looking like one of the worst ; how an air of fatalism about their chances became a self - fulfilling prophecy ; and how @entity35 appeared so intensely relaxed about the fact that @entity13 were miles off the pace			1
in fact , batting was not even the half of their problems – another reason why the @entity4 debate risks straying into red - herring territory			1
five members of the top seven averaged over 35 , with strike - rates ranging from @entity119 ’s 135 to @entity118 ’s 77			0
these are not figures to win you a @entity99 , but neither are they out - and - out disasters			2
far worse was the bowling , with @entity124 and @entity125 taking nine wickets between them at an average of 55			1
not until @entity130 was given a game against @entity132 did anyone nail a yorker			0
@entity134 went for nearly seven an over , which was expensive even by the standards of this @entity99			1
and the refusal to look at @entity138 and @entity139 until it was too late was plain stubborn			0
video we take responsibility for exit - @entity142 @entity125 was a key member of @entity13 's struggling bowling attack during the @entity99 @entity134 ( right ) has gone backwards in both pace and achievement as a bowler @entity147 has added pace but @entity13 's bowling stocks pale in comparison with the likes of @entity152 these are all questions that should concern @entity155 and @entity156 in the short term			1
but the long term is even more worrying : where are @entity13 ’s fast bowlers going to come from ? this is the area that has always been most poorly served by an overcrowded domestic schedule played on tired pitches			1
even @entity124 has always relied on craftsmanship rather than speed , while @entity125 keeps breaking down and @entity134 has slowed			1
how long before satisfaction over the extra yard of pace added by @entity147 gives way to another sense of anti-climax ? for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity176 : @ the_topspin @entity2 fast bowlers emerge in spite of the system , not because of it			0
pudding - like pitches help medium - pacers			0
why waste all the effort of tearing in at 92mph when you can put it there or thereabouts – three words that get to the heart of @entity2 cricket – at 78mph and watch the grass do the rest ? we ca n't simply blame the climate			0
a decade ago , @entity194 would cause @entity195 to lick his lips			0
the @entity197 has had its moments too			0
@entity199 makes bowlers work hard for their wickets			0
more damaging , we 're left to conclude , is a domestic set - up which encourages fast bowlers to throttle back if they 're to stand any chance of making it through the season			2
it should n't be the case that @entity13 feel the need to take promising young quicks out of the domestic game , away from the coaches who know them best			1
a glance at @entity152 's list of fast bowlers provides an unnerving glimpse of the future			2
if @entity13 are able to come up with an attack that regularly takes 20 wickets , then the inclusion or otherwise of one batsman will feel like an irrelevance			1
@entity223 then again … @entity224 believes @entity4 has a 10 per cent chance of playing for @entity13 again			1
the mystery is why @entity4 is n't doing his best to increase the odds			1
speaking on @entity41 last week , he had some fair things to say about the way @entity230 had handled @entity13 's @entity99 campaign – but basic psychology tells you they were the kind of points better made by an out - and - out pundit , not a man hoping to resurrect his international career by working with … @entity230 ! @entity230 ( left ) will hardly be encouraged by his previous with @entity4 ... and @entity4 's latest comments ' i heard the coach come out and say : " we do n’t have a settled side " , ' said @entity4			1
' well mate , you played six months of one - day cricket before that game			0
even if you do n’t think you 've got a settled squad , you do n’t go and tell the whole world you do n’t have a settled squad			0
" later : ' i 've played under @entity251 and i had a worse relationship with @entity251 than i did with @entity230			2
' it 's fine to have these views			2
we all have thoughts we realise it 's best to keep to ourselves			2
but , not for the first time , you do wonder : who , if anyone , is advising @entity4 ? @entity142 has conflicting @entity264 and @entity13 duties double standards ? that said , it would be intriguing to know what @entity4 makes of @entity142 's decision to place his @entity264 deal with @entity271 ahead of @entity13 's trip to @entity273 in may for a one - day international that has taken on an extra dimension following the @entity99 farce			1
@entity4 has been criticised in the past – including by this writer – for seeking to place @entity264 commitments ahead of national duty			2
yet the @entity282 's more relaxed approach to the @entity264 sheds a more sympathetic light on @entity4 's wishes			1
he has not always helped himself , but his contention that @entity2 cricket is riven with double standards is boosted by @entity142 's position			2
and @entity142 , do n't forget , is @entity13 's one - day captain			1
a proud tradition there was uproar last week when @entity295 's @entity294 newspaper published a nasty piece headlined ' @entity297 out of @entity99 ' – a reference to a crucial catch held by @entity301 's @entity300 to dismiss @entity302 , with replays suggesting @entity305 's foot made contact with the boundary as he held on			2
@entity305 has previously admitted problems with drink and depression , though quite what this had to do with the incident in question was anyone 's guess			0
@entity301 's @entity300 was the subject of a cruel piece by @entity295 's @entity294 newspaper @entity305 helped @entity301 eliminate @entity320 from the @entity99 by catching out @entity302 tv replays suggested @entity305 's foot touched the boundary rope , meaning the catch should not have stood a @entity325 colleague , however , suggested we were all misplacing our energy			0
so absurd , she said , was the @entity294 that it recently ran an editorial berating journalists for their coverage of @entity332 's comedy stumble on a carpet at @entity335 airport			0
the @entity294 was so keen to prove that @entity332 's accident had nothing to do with his age ( he is 91 ) , and everything to do with a ' poorly laid - out carpet ' , that it solemnly listed other moments of high - society slapstick			0
the clinching proof that @entity26 was still fit as a fiddle ? ' in 1975 , @entity344 president @entity343 tumbled down the @entity347 while visiting @entity348			0

@entity4 could be back in contention for @entity13 return
but *controversial* batsman will not win the ashes on his own this summer
@entity230 has more serious problem with @entity13 's bowling attack
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity134 et @entity359 are cause for concern
