by @entity1 reporter @entity3 scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in discovering why neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity6 's affect certain people in old age while others can live to 100 and not develop dementia			1
the research , published on wednesday in the journal nature , focused on a protein previously thought to act mostly in the brains of developing fetuses			0
the scientists found that the protein , called @entity17 , also appeared to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging - related stresses			1
@entity3 scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in discovering why neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity6 's affect certain people in old age while others can live to 100 and not develop dementia ( stock photo ) but in people with @entity6 ’s and other dementias , the protein was sharply depleted in key brain regions			1
‘ our work raises the possibility that the abnormal protein aggregates associated with @entity6 's and other neurodegenerative diseases may not be sufficient to cause dementia ; you may also need a failure of the brain 's stress response system , ’ said @entity29 , @entity30 professor of genetics and leader of the study			1
‘ if true , this opens up a new area in terms of treatment possibilities for the more than five million @entity51 currently living with alzheimer 's disease , ’ said @entity29 , who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate the toxic effects of amyloid beta , the hallmark abnormal protein in @entity6 's			2
the research underscores a different way of looking at neurodegenerative diseases			0
brain effect : this computer graphic shows a slice of the brain of an alzheimer patient ( left ) compared with a normal brain ( right )			0
the @entity6 's brain is considerably shrunken instead of focusing on the negative changes that cause disease , researchers examined trouble spots in the brain 's ability to protect itself over time			2
@entity29 said the study suggests a person may be able to resist the toxic effects of @entity6 's if rest levels remain high			2
‘ if we could activate this stress - resistance gene network with drugs , it might be possible to intervene in the disease quite early , ’ he said			2
but they cautioned that much more needed to be determined , including whether the decline of @entity17 was a cause , or an effect , of brain deterioration , and whether it was specific enough to neurological diseases that it could lead to effective therapies			0
he also has thoughts about a potential treatment , lithium , which he said appears to stimulate rest function , and is considered relatively safe			0
as dementia rates rise , researchers believe preventive studies such as this will be critical in finding a cure			0
some estimates say the number of people living with dementia will double to nearly 70 million by 2030			1
' this is an extremely important study , ' said @entity100 , director of the @entity101 at the @entity102 , who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary accompanying the study			0
' this is the first study that is really starting to provide a plausible pathway to explain why some people are more vulnerable to @entity6 ’s than other people			1

@entity3 scientists believe they may have made a breakthrough in treating people suffering from dementia
they found that the protein , rest , appeared to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging - related stresses
but the protein was sharply depleted in key brain regions in people with @entity6 ’s and other dementias
findings could lead to the *creation* of new drugs to treat the growing issue
the number of people living with dementia is estimated to double to nearly 70 million by 2030
