@entity0 face a major @entity2 inquiry , a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after @entity7 players appeared to be assaulted as the @entity9 quarter - final at @entity10 descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of @entity0 fans			1
in alarming scenes , which were a throwback to the football hooliganism of the @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity7 players were left defenceless as fans rushed on to the pitch			1
scorer @entity22 claimed he was bitten , while @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 all appeared to be barged aggressively , and the latter seemingly struck on the back of the head by one fan as @entity24 attempted to shepherd him off			1
on the final whistle , thousands of fans came on and even @entity0 players were threatened by the melee			1
@entity0 captain @entity22 , who scored the first goal in the 2 - 0 win , said : ' it was very , very scary			1
my armband got nicked , some got my boot but i could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that			2
people tried to kiss me , and were biting me			0
' @entity0 seemed to exacerbate the problem by playing the celebratory song ' @entity86 ' over the @entity87 while fans were still streaming on to the pitch , and put a video of fans celebrating on the pitch on their official @entity94 feed			1
meagre numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play a club statement read : ' the club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances			1
' we are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment for our fans was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves			2
' they have let both themselves and their club down			2
' the club extends its sincere apologies to the @entity2 , the @entity7 directors , manager @entity120 and all his staff and players			1
' @entity7 manager @entity120 said : ' it 's disgraceful			1
we do n't want to see those scenes			0
they 've beaten us and for that to happen , that 's just mindless idiots			0
if you 're @entity0 , you need to look at the stewards as they came over to our fans and there was nobody there			1
' @entity0 should look at the stewarding			1
it 's a quarter - final , it 's a full house and you know it 's going to be tasty			2
so you should have stewards both ends of the pitch			2
' supporters were coming on with a few minutes to go			0
they were congregating at the ends anyway a few minutes from time , so it puts player at danger and you do n't want to see that			0
we were seeing that in the @entity18 and @entity19 and we do n't want to see that			0
' i 'm sure the @entity2 will look at it without be poking my nose into it			2
if you ask me from a football point of view , if you had a load of stewards then it would be sorted out			0
most of the grounds in the @entity160 are well stewarded			0
i 'm sure @entity0 are disappointed this has happened			2
' scorer @entity162 ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates @entity165 and @entity166 @entity0 manager @entity167 admitted he could understand the fans ' emotions after the victory asked whether any @entity7 players had been assaulted , @entity120 said : ' i do n't know			1
i did n't ask them			0
everyone looked as though they had their heads and arms on			0
they looked ok to me			0
they got in , intact			0
i 'm more concerned with trying to stop it before it happens			0
' @entity182 confirmed on sunday that they had arrested 17 men for various public order offences , including one on suspicion of assaulting an officer , and authorities are also investigating an incident in a nearby pub before the game			1
a police statement read : ' we carried out a large policing operation for the @entity9 yesterday evening ( march 7 ) to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment			1
' during the course of the operation 17 men were arrested for various public order offences			1
an investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the @entity204 pub. ' anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call @entity208 , anonymously , on 0800 555 111			2
' we will also be supporting the @entity2 to identify people involved in pitch invasions that happened at the end of the match			1
' the @entity2 , who are believed to have had a ' crowd control advisor ' present , will begin investigations tomorrow , asking @entity0 for their observations and their plans for stewarding			1
@entity182 will also submit evidence and the report of referee @entity62 will be taken into consideration			0
though @entity0 had a significant presence of stewards by the @entity7 fans , there were far fewer by the @entity10 where the @entity0 fans sit and they were quickly overcome by the scale on the invasion			1
@entity7 boss @entity120 believes @entity0 need to look at their stewarding following saturday 's incidents fans sing and chant on the pitch following @entity0 's win during what has been a disappointing season the @entity2 can impose a range of sanctions from ground closure to fines , if the club have been considered negligent			1
there is no prospect of @entity0 being thrown out of the tournament but any ground closure or reduction in capacity could affect the team in their fight against relegation			2
the most likely outcome would seem to be a fine in the region of Â£ 100,000			0
@entity0 manager @entity167 said : ' i did n't know @entity7 players had been hit			1
i can understand the emotions of the fan beating their local rivals twice in a week but you ca n't condone fans coming on the pitch			2
we do n't condone it , especially if anyone was touched			0
' what can you do ? the stewards did their best			0
i saw them rugby tackling a few guys			0
but when they 're coming in such numbers it 's difficult to stem it			0
' it has been a good week			0
i 'd rather talk about the football			0
the players want to dedicate the victory to the fans because they 've had some hard times here			2
and we 're going to need those fans			2
it 's been a very good week but here 's stil a lot of hard work and we need those fans every step of the way			0
' @entity288 , who was co-commentator for @entity290 's coverage added : ' it 's like a scene from the 1980s all over again			0
' @entity7 fans also acted irresponsibly , ripping out several seats in the away section and launching them onto the @entity0 fans below when @entity162 scored the second goal			1
goalscorer @entity22 claims fans nicked his captain 's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion the scene at @entity10 as hundreds of jubilant fans stormed the pitch shortly after the final whistle one fan swings on the @entity10 crossbar as @entity167 's side booked their place at @entity311			1
