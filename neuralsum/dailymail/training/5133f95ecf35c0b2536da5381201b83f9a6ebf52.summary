by @entity1 reporter published : 14:45 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 15:43 est , 20 august 2013 evening newscasts on @entity3 and @entity4 are both gaining ground on market leader @entity6 of @entity8 , but that 's one of the few things they have in common			1
behind @entity11 , second - place @entity3 is making strides with a sleek " @entity13 " that emphasizes the @entity15 family , news that hits home and the cultural zeitgeist			1
@entity19 has revealed himself to be a traditionalist at ' @entity21 , ' leading a show weighty with significant national and international events			0
@entity8 's ' @entity24 ' remains in first place , where it has generally been since the late 1990s except for a brief run by @entity27 at @entity3			1
the @entity29 company said @entity8 's viewership is down from last year while @entity3 and @entity4 are up , with @entity3 in july winning a week among the key 25 - to - 54 - year - old demographic for the first time since 2008			1
the ratings leader : @entity6 has anchored the @entity8 ' @entity24 ' to ratings prominence since the late 1990s despite decades - long prophecies of doom , network evening newscasts remain a vital part of television 's landscape , collectively reaching more than 22 million people each weeknight			1
often , @entity6 ' newscast is more popular than @entity8 's prime - time programming			1
now there 's a creative push to distinguish broadcasts that once seemed interchangeable			2
' we recognize the environment has changed very significantly , ' said @entity51 , @entity3 's senior vice president of news			1
' the days when an evening newscast can act as a digest of the day 's news are gone			0
' what 's happening in the evening is similar to the morning , in terms of content			0
@entity3 's ' @entity58 ' has swept past @entity8 's ' today ' with a breezy show on the tip of pop culture and hosts that ooze chemistry			1
@entity4 remains in third , but has gained ground since it stopped trying to imitate its rivals			1
the most visible recent sign of the different approaches came not in the evening but a few hours before			0
on july 22 , when @entity70 's prince @entity69 and @entity71 became parents for the first time , @entity3 cut away from regular afternoon programming for more than an hour to talk about the birth , coverage that featured @entity77			1
@entity4 did n't bother with a special report , a judgment that stood out more because @entity8 did the same as @entity3			1
@entity19 reported the story on the evening news			0
the traditionalist : @entity19 , anchor of ' @entity21 , ' tends to focus on more hard - hitting stories @entity86 president @entity85 quipped that ' it was n't the @entity88			2
' ' we tried to not completely lose our minds covering it , ' @entity85 said			0
' i do n't think we were making a statement			0
i think the others were making a statement about themselves by doing it			0
' @entity51 is fine with that			0
@entity3 has stayed on the story , airing a ' @entity13 ' report last wednesday featuring prince @entity69 talking about the experience of being a new dad			2
' millions and millions of people in @entity15 were interested in the birth of the royal baby , ' he said			0
we just report the news			0
' day - to - day , the differences are more muted			0
in 13 of 23 weekdays in july , the two evening newscasts led with the same story , according to news consultant @entity114			2
on some of the days they diverged , @entity3 picked stories with more populist appeal			1
one day , @entity3 led with weather and forest fires , while @entity4 started with @entity120 politics			1
@entity3 led another day when the women kept imprisoned in a @entity123 home released a video message ; @entity4 had a follow - up report on the @entity127 plane crash			1
on july 24 , @entity4 began its broadcast with economic news , while @entity3 opened by reporting the name of @entity69 and @entity71 's baby			1
getting beyond the day 's obvious headlines is where different priorities emerge			0
@entity3 frequently airs detailed reports by @entity136 that give concrete advice on how families can find savings ; she recently talked about trimming fees included in home sales and costs related to sending someone off to college			2
the ' @entity146 ' series is less ' news ' than practical advice			0
@entity11 's daily ' @entity149 ' has voiceovers on stories like a study on successful marriages and soda companies defending the use of sugar substitutes			0
she 's shown @entity159 - worthy clips of a panda bear mom welcoming back her baby and a confused grandmother throwing her drink at a bride instead of confetti			0
family oriented : @entity13 anchor @entity11 focuses on stories with populist appeal ' at the end of the broadcast , people not only feel empowered , smarter and enlightened , they know some of the things going on in the world that are interesting , that people are talking about , ' said @entity176 , ' @entity13 ' executive producer			0
at @entity4 , ' we like to have news all the way through the broadcast , ' said @entity180 , executive producer			2
that does n't mean all protein and no garnish : the panda clip ran on @entity4 , too			2
yet while @entity3 played up a tearful @entity185 and @entity186 testifying in favor of a @entity189 law restricting paparazzi , @entity4 ignored the celebrities			1
@entity114 's content analysis also illustrates priorities			0
for instance , @entity3 spent twice as much time as @entity4 on winter weather stories and liked tales of lottery winners			1
@entity4 has given roughly four times the airtime to stories on gun control than @entity3 , with more than twice the coverage of @entity203			1
@entity4 spent 47 minutes on federal budget squabbles and the sequester to @entity3 's 18 minutes			1
' i do n't think people watch @entity86 because of cooking and concerts and royal updates , ' @entity85 said			0
' they do watch us for @entity214 news , international coverage , health and science			0
' @entity4 ' viewership is up 7 percent this year to 6.4 million people per episode , @entity29 said			2
@entity4 is down 2 percent , however , among that 25 - to - 54 - year - old demographic			2
that indicates ' @entity21 ' is winning back many traditional viewers – the people who once watched @entity224 , not just read about him – more than gaining new ones			0
@entity3 's audience is up 3 percent to 7.6 million , while @entity8 is down 2 percent to 8.4 million			1
@entity51 said @entity3 works under the assumption that most viewers know the headlines when they tune in and are looking for something new			2
@entity3 emphasizes its own exclusives , leading ' @entity13 ' last month when @entity233 interviewed a juror in the @entity236 trial and last week shuffling the broadcast at the last minute for a @entity239 report on drone strikes in @entity241			2
@entity180 said @entity4 hopes vivid reporting can take viewers inside the news of the day – sometimes literally , as @entity19 hits the road on big stories			1
' we have more than 140 characters , ' she said .			0

newscasts have become much more creative and are targeting different audiences by focusing on different interests
@entity4 has given roughly four times the airtime to stories on gun control than @entity3 , with more than twice the coverage of @entity203
@entity8 has led the ratings almost *non-stop* since the late 1990s
