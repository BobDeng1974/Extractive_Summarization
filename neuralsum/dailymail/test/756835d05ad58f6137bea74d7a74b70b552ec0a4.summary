the @entity0 has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in @entity2 this week			1
her majesty , who is approaching her 89th birthday , was spotted riding her faithful black fell pony , @entity5 , as she was joined by @entity6 and her @entity7 in the beautiful park close to her @entity10 home on monday			1
she was well prepared for any spring showers in a lightweight waterproof , and , as is her wont , eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves			2
today 's second riding partner , @entity23 , is a close friend of the @entity24 and also the @entity0 's @entity25 , regularly photographed with the @entity19 at equestrian events and important ceremonial occasions			2
the multi-millionaire , 72 , is one of @entity31 's richest men thanks to the @entity6 family 's estimated £ 750million fortune through the family meat business , @entity35			1
active : her majesty , who is approaching her 89th birthday , was spotted riding her faithful black @entity40 pony , @entity5 park life : the queen was joined by @entity6 and her @entity7 @entity7 whilst @entity23 and @entity7 wore hard hats for the ride , the @entity0 wore only a light , floral headscarf			1
she finished the look with some pale jodphurs and deep , brown riding boots			0
despite being encouraged to use a riding helmet in the past the @entity0 has reportedly never worn one because of her hair			0
speaking in an interview last year , her racing trainer @entity52 recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat			0
the @entity0 is said to have replied : ' i never have and you do n’t have to have your hair done like i do			0
' her majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a @entity66 pony , named @entity67 , aged four			0
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them @entity72 , a black farm - bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and @entity77 , a grey gelding whom the @entity0 famously galloped down the course at @entity81 in 1961			0
no helmet : @entity0 , pictured here on friday , never wears a riding helmet preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf cutting back : she has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over @entity93 on horseback			1
nevertheless , the @entity0 remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her @entity10 stables			0
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably @entity104 's children , @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107			0
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds @entity40 ponies and has a stud specialising in @entity113 ponies at @entity114			1
first love : the @entity0 's first pony was a tiny @entity66 named @entity67 who was given to her at the age of four familiar sight : the @entity0 riding her much - loved horse @entity120 during @entity93 seal of approval : a fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the @entity0 at @entity125 one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , @entity40 ponies like the @entity0 's mount @entity5 , have roamed the moors of @entity131 since the @entity133 period			1
docile , hardy and thick - set , the majority of @entity40 ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh			1
highly prized by the @entity140 , the @entity142 tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading @entity147 and were used as trade goods all over the @entity149			0
the @entity147 also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today			0
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to @entity154 and @entity155 ponies ) , by the end of the @entity158 period , the average @entity40 was more than a hand higher			1
another invader to fall in love with the @entity40 pony was the @entity163 , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the @entity168			2
by the 13th century , the @entity40 's usefulness as a pack animal was well - established and the pony played an important role in @entity31 trade until the end of the 18th century			2
following the @entity176 , @entity175 were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed			0
although previously used in trotting races , the @entity40 pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families			2
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the @entity0 who breeds @entity40 ponies at her @entity125 stud			1

the queen was spotted enjoying another ride in @entity2 today
rode her favourite @entity40 , a mare named @entity5
joined by @entity206 , one of the richest men in @entity208
left her hard hat at home and opted for a silk scarf instead
