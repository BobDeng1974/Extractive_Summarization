by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 believes any side he chooses to field against @entity5 will be capable of overturning a 1 - 0 deficit in their @entity8 play - off second leg - but has urged his players to show patience			1
@entity2 made wholesale changes for the opening encounter against the @entity14 team last week but an uncharacteristic error from goalkeeper @entity16 led to the @entity17 facing an uphill task on thursday evening			1
despite the setback at the @entity20 , @entity2 is once again prepared to shuffle his pack as he contemplates having to juggle a squad on both domestic and @entity24 fronts this season			2
hoping : @entity2 believes @entity3 can overturn a 1 - 0 deficit against @entity5 in their @entity8 play - off that dilemma will only occur if his side can come from behind and defeat @entity5 to reach the group stages of the competition , although @entity2 is supremely confident			1
' we 've got a squad of depth which i 'm very , very comfortable with			0
we made wholesale changes last week , i do n't think it 's going to be as many this week but we 'll certainly make a few , ' @entity2 said			1
' it 's quite simple , we 've got to win the match and we 're capable of that , no matter what line - up i pick , we 're capable of winning the game			2
' we know that we 'd love to be in the next stages ; to get in the group stages would be terrific for the club , we 're aware of that			0
we 're also aware of how difficult it is with all the pitfalls that come with it			0
' we 'll be going all out to try and get a result and get us through to the league situation which we 'd all look forward to			0
' settling in : new boy @entity52 trains with former @entity54 duo @entity53 and @entity55 working hard : following the arrival of @entity52 , @entity2 is very pleased with the squads depth at @entity3 this term @entity2 , however , is wary of his side taking @entity5 lightly and has warned them not to throw caution to the wind , as they did in the third qualifying round , when they had to come from a goal down against @entity67 to progress			1
' the one thing you ca n't be is gung ho , ' @entity2 said			2
' they 're good opposition , they 've got some good players ; you do n't finish fifth in the @entity14 league and win the ( domestic ) cup if you 're not a good side			0
' so of course you 've got to have a bit of patience , you 've got to have a bit of guile about you and if we leave ourselves exposed at the back then like we did against @entity67 we 'll concede after a minute			0
' however , @entity2 was keen to add that they must dictate the tempo of the contest			2
' it 's vitally important that we play at a level which we 're comfortable with and the one thing about the @entity93 to other leagues is the pace , the tempo , the quickness to it is the main difference , ' he said			2
done deal : @entity52 becsmr @entity3 's sixth summer signing as @entity2 tries to deepen his squad ' so we 've got play at our pace to make sure that we are on the front foot against them			1
' @entity3 received a boost ahead of the clash on tuesday night with the signing of @entity52 from @entity54 although the defender will be ineligible to make his bow against @entity5			1
@entity2 , though , believes the 30 - year - old 's experience whilst he was with @entity54 will prove invaluable during the season as @entity3 once again attempt to remain in the @entity93			1
' he 's a quality player who 's played at the highest level in the @entity93 for the last seven or eight years , ' @entity2 added			1
' all of the ingredients in what he brings to the table was the reason why we brought him here			0
' it 's going to be difficult in the second season			0
' so the additions of people like himself can only help the cause			0
we 're trying to move the thing forward and trying to get a bigger and better squad because it 's a long season ahead with many games to play and when a quality addition like him becomes available we 're delighted to get him			0

@entity2 confident @entity3 can overcome @entity5 in @entity8 play - off
@entity17 must overturn 1 - 0 deficit to progress in competition
