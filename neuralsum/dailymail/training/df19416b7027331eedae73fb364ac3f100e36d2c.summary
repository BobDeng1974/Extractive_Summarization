but the deputy prime minister was not prepared for it to be delivered in the unmistakeable tones of a certain ‘ @entity2 from @entity18 ’			2
@entity3 mayor mr @entity2 called in to weekly show ' @entity21 ' on @entity22 to demand cabinet ministers ditch their ‘ posh limos ’ and use public transport ‘ like everybody else ’			1

but only this week , welsh secretary @entity41 was spotted being driven 100 yards in his government @entity42 from his office to the gates of @entity45			0
the car waited 90 minutes while mr @entity41 attended a @entity48 meeting before driving him back again			0
yesterday , mr @entity2 said in a pre-recorded question : ‘ hi @entity5 , it ’s @entity2 here from @entity18			1
' i just want to ask you when are you going to get all those government ministers out of their posh limos and on to public transport like everybody else			1
‘ and how can we possibly expect the government to vote for increases in infrastructure spending which we need in this city , and upgrading the tube which we all need , when they sit in their chauffeur - driven limousines paid for by the taxpayer rather than getting down on public transport with the rest of us ? @entity2 – over and out			1
’ mr @entity5 replied that the largest infrastructure project in @entity86 , @entity87 , was being built in @entity3 and the mayor could take advantage of @entity91 guarantees for other projects			1
he added : ‘ tell him to get out of his limo and get the infrastructure projects we are offering him moving			0
’ @entity98 announced a crackdown on ministerial cars , which cost more than £ 10million a year under @entity37 , when he came into office			0
he said : ‘ if there is something that really annoys people it ’s seeing politicians swanning around in chauffeur - driven cars like they ’re the @entity107			0
’ mr @entity5 also fielded a question about @entity109 , the former energy minister facing jail , but stopped short of asking him to return his £ 17,000 ministerial severance pay			2
