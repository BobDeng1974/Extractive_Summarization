the @entity1 embassy says it hopes a koala hugged by president @entity3 at the @entity5 summit in @entity6 has survived a mass culling of the marsupials by wildlife officers			1
the seemingly light - hearted comment on the embassy 's facebook page refers to the summit in @entity14 , but the koala cull was carried out in @entity16			1
the message follows news that 686 koalas were put down near @entity16 's @entity20 in 2013 and 2014 , an operation carried out in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals			1
wildlife officers captured and euthanised the koalas , reportedly by lethal injection , in response to overpopulation and starvation in the area 's manna gum woodlands			1
' the post includes photographs of president @entity3 and @entity59 president @entity58 holding koalas at the @entity5 summit in november			1
the summit was notable for @entity65 leaders ' irritation with mr @entity3 over @entity1 's actions in the @entity68 conflict			1
mr @entity3 left the summit early following his frosty reception , the koala hugging having provided a rare lighter moment			1
hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in @entity16 due to concerns over starvation @entity16 's environment minister @entity78 said on wednesday that the state government had asked experts to advise on the management of koalas at @entity83 , about 230km southwest of @entity84			1
she would n't rule out future koala culls , if recommended by the expert panel but said in the future the culls would n’t be kept secret			2
' my main priority is making sure that we reduce the suffering of koalas due to starvation , ' ms @entity78 said			0
@entity1 president @entity3 in @entity96 this week on march 4 @entity59 president @entity58 also met @entity97 the koala at the @entity5 in @entity6 the @entity16 government euthanised 686 koalas at @entity83 , about 230km southwest of @entity84 @entity83 koalas ca n't be moved from their native habitat because they overeat and die , she said			1
premier @entity104 said the cull happened some years ago , not under the current government , and there should have been more transparency			0
the koalas were reportedly killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees			2
koalas suffering starvation were euthanised , while healthy koalas were released back into the wild and healthy females were treated with control hormone implants			2
animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their ' cruel ' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret			1
@entity124 chief executive @entity123 could n't understand why the cull was kept quiet			0
' if they had good , sound expert advice and had adequately explored all other options then they should have been forthcoming with what they were doing and why , ' she said in a statement			0
@entity134 chief @entity133 said she had heard rumours that koalas were being killed but had never had proof until now			2
' i want somebody charged , ' ms @entity138 said			0
' the @entity142 government over my whole career has said there will never be a cull in @entity41 ever			2
' it 's cruel and mean to koalas and pays no respect for the role they play in tourism - how dare they treat this animal with that sort of level of disrespect			2
@entity134 chief @entity133 questioned why the program was conducted in secret ' and if they are so proud of what they were doing why was it done in secret ? ' koala expert dr @entity164 , who advised the government on the euthanasia program , said that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size			1
ms @entity138 said more should have been done in previous years to stop the problem from escalating ' watching an animal starve to death is a horrible thing , ' dr @entity164 , from @entity173 , told @entity177			0
' for every one koala that was euthanised there were probably two or three that starved without intervention			0
' it at least was a good thing to put them out of their misery			0
' dr @entity164 said moving the population to other areas or conducting fertility control programs were expensive options			0
' a lot of people ask why we ca n't just move the koalas somewhere else , but i think it 's important to recognise the translocation koalas often has a negative impact , ' she said			0
' a large number would die , and they do n't want to move from manna gum			2
' it 's sort of a lose - lose situation all round			0
' dr @entity164 said the problem in the manna gum woodland at @entity83 was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from @entity208			1
' manna gum is a very good food source for koalas , it 's low in toxins and high in nutrients so koalas love it , ' she said			1
' to the point where they do n't move for the food supply			0
' @entity221 can move one or two kilometres in a night but in this population , they stay in these manna gum areas and numbers build up			2
' ms @entity138 said more should have been done in previous years to prevent the problem from escalating			0
the problem in the manna gum woodland at @entity83 was caused after koalas were introduced to the area in the 1980s from @entity208 the koalas , many of which were starving , were killed via lethal injection after being captured in tree ' instead of doing this why did n't they plant trees all those years ago ? ' she said ' they could have taken young ones out and relocated them			1
' they 've done nothing – they 've watched until the problem becomes immense and then gone " oh we better do something let 's kill them			0
" ' it 's easy to say we had to put them out of their misery – they should n't have got to that misery in first place			0
' at @entity83 there are up to 11 koalas per hectare , but the sustainable density is less than one koala per hectare			2
the cull is said to have occurred in secret to avoid a backlash from activists and locals koala expert dr @entity164 , who advised the government on the euthanasia program , stressed that the objective was to humanely deal with suffering koalas rather than reduce population size @entity16 environment minister @entity78 said she was putting in place a koala management program to deal with the ' a very challenging and complex issue '			1
' it is clear it 's an overpopulation issue and it is clear that we have had koalas suffer in that @entity83 area because of ill health and starvation , ' ms @entity78 told @entity283			1
' that 's just not good enough and that 's a terrible way to treat koalas			0
' i 'm wanting to make sure that we 're taking the best action we can in this terrible situation of overpopulation			0
' i do n't want to see koalas suffer			0
' the koala is listed as ' vulnerable ' in @entity294 , @entity14 and the @entity295 and as ' rare ' in @entity41 but it has no official listing in @entity16 .			1
