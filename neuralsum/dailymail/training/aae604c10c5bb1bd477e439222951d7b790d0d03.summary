@entity2 's population is set to double to more than 2.4billion over the next few decades due to improved health care and medicines , a new study found			1
@entity2 - the world ’s poorest region - will record the largest amount of population growth of any area in the world between now and 2050 , according to the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
but the massive baby boom could put huge strain on resources and fledgling economies in some of the world 's most deprived areas , the @entity10 warned			0
care : wide - reaching vaccination programmes and medical care mean more children are surviving to reach adulthood and the projected growth in population assumes that family planning will become more widespread in regions where , for religious or cultural reasons , contraception has not been widely adopted			1
the 10 countries worldwide with the highest fertility are all in @entity2			1
today , women in @entity2 average 5.2 children , a rate that rises as high as 7.6 in @entity32			1
and improved access to medicine and health care mean millions more of these children will now survive to adulthood			0
@entity38 , the organisation 's president and ceo , said : ' nearly all of that growth will be in the 51 countries of @entity2 , the region ’s poorest			2
' rapid population growth makes it difficult for economies to create enough jobs to lift large numbers of people out of poverty			0
' in addition to high birth rates , the region ’s population is also quite young , with 43 percent of the population below age 15			0
population rise : improvements in medicine and health care are leading to more children surviving infancy in @entity2 ( file picture ) devastation : famine and illness had meant many children died long before they could go on to become mothers and fathers @entity70 , senior demographer and co-author of the data sheet , said : ' given its youthful population , future population growth in @entity2 will depend upon the degree to which the parents of tomorrow use family planning			1
' the projections that we cite assume that family planning will become more widespread			1
if not , @entity2 ’s population will grow more rapidly , further constraining efforts to address poverty , create jobs , and protect the environment			2
' this year ’s @entity87 provides detailed information on 20 population , health , and environment indicators for more than 200 countries , and has a special focus on wealth and income inequality			0
developing countries tend to have wide income gaps between rich and poor that are associated with dramatic differences in fertility and health			0
in @entity104 , women from the poorest fifth of families have twice as many children as those from the wealthiest fifth			0
and children from the poorest families are much more likely to die before turning 5 than their counterparts in the wealthiest families			0
@entity10 ’s 2013 @entity112 shows the stark contrasts between rich and poor countries , illustrated by comparing @entity32 and the @entity115			2
@entity115 population ( 2013 ) 16.9 million 16.8 @entity117 ( 2050 ) 65.8 million 17.9 million2050 @entity119 as a multiple of 2013 3.9 @entity118 per @entity121 195,000 141,000 % of @entity122 15 50 % 17 % % of @entity123 65 + ( 2013 ) 3 % 16 % % of @entity123 65 + ( projected 2050 ) 3 % 27 % @entity124 ( all ) 57 years 81 @entity125 ( per 1,000 live births ) 51 @entity127 43,000 650 even though the two countries have almost the same population size today , @entity32 is projected to nearly quadruple its population from about 17 million today to 66 million in 2050			1
the @entity115 ’ population will likely grow very slowly from 17 million to 18 million over that same time			0
at the root of this ' demographic divide ' are differences in the average number of births per woman and the share of the population in their childbearing years			0
@entity32 ’s total fertility rate of 7.6 lifetime births per woman is more than four times the @entity143 ’ rate of 1.7 per woman			1
one - half of @entity32 ’s population is younger than age 15 , compared with 17 percent of the @entity143 ’ population .			2

population expected to rise from *1.1billion* today to 2.4 billion by 2050
projections assume that family planning will become more widespread
women in @entity2 give birth to an average of 5.2 children
in @entity32 mothers have on average 7.6 children
