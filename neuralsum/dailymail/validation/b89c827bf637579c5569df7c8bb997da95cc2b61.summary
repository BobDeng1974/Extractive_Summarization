prehistoric hunters may have tipped their stone arrows and spears with poisons to help them bring down prey , scientists believe			1
researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them			1
preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000 - year - old stone - tipped arrows from @entity15 were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant @entity18			1
dr @entity19 , a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the @entity21 at the @entity22 , believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago			1
the image above shows arrows from @entity28 that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison she said that @entity32 hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly			1
early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested			1
scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans			1
a study of fossils of @entity47 , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully			0
this would have enabled @entity47 to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey			1
she said : ' it made good sense for people to use poisons			1
' on their own , palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer			1
' poisonous plants were plentiful and the prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived , they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons			0
' to fabricate a poison is easy and economic , and the risk is minimal			0
in addition , the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting			0
' dr @entity19 has been working with forensic scientist @entity84 from @entity85 and dr @entity86 , from the @entity87 , to test for the presence of poisonous plants on prehistoric weapons			2
using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists , they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons			1
they are also looking for the presence of starch grains that may have been left on the weapons from toxic plant material			2
this wooden spatula from @entity105 wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting dr @entity19 has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in @entity15 ( left ) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue			1
the image on the right shows a pot of curare , a plant - based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter - gatherers in @entity120 to coat darts and arrows they can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants			1
dr @entity19 has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique			1
these include a 1926 @entity28 pot containing @entity136 poison inside , @entity105 darts tipped with the poison @entity138 , @entity28 crossbow arrows and a number of @entity143 arrows			1
many hunter gatherer societies are known to use poisons when they are hunting			0
the @entity147 people in the @entity149 rainforest use curare - a mix of bark scrapings from @entity154 vines - to tip their darts and arrows when hunting			2
the use of curare was once common among indigenous populations in @entity120			0
the researchers have used starch grains like the ones shown on the left from the plant @entity136 napellus to help identify poisonous materials			2
@entity136 was found inside this pot on the right thought to date from 1926 in @entity143 hunters use another species of @entity154 to produce the poison strychnine , while other plants like @entity18 , and @entity172 are also used			2
hunters in @entity174 are also known to have used monkshood to kill large animals such as bears and @entity179 ibex			0
the seeds from yew trees are also thought to have been used to poison arrows			2
dr @entity19 has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty @entity15			1
these 4,000 - year - old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat			1
opium , magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years			0
an anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood - altering substances since the @entity198			0
professor @entity199 has compiled evidence from around the world that @entity203 people were taking drugs derived from cacti in @entity206 and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around @entity208			0
researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in @entity213 on @entity214 in the southern @entity215 , which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant			2
it is still chewed through out much of @entity174 as a mild stimulant			0
charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the bronze age @entity223 culture that appeared in @entity225 around @entity226			0
this bone harpoon in a museum in @entity229 carries a warning label that reads ' care , has been poisoned ' the animal did not die but became ill , suggesting the presence of a poison			0
dr @entity19 said : ' nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals			0
' initial tests strongly suggest the presence of @entity18 , a poisonous plant on our database , but we ca n’t be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound			2
' we know that the @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 used plant - based poisons both for hunting animals and in war			1
' in fact , the word ‘ toxic ’ come from @entity257 , the @entity250 for bow			0
@entity259 is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows			0
' it also produces seeds used to poison arrows			2
in @entity269 , yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals would n’t be poisoned by eating their berries			0
“ few hunter - gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons			0

scientists at @entity22 are testing ancient weapons for poisons
they believe paleolithic hunters used plant toxins up to 30,000 years ago
this would have made stone tipped spears and arrows more lethal to prey
early tests on 4,000 - year - old arrows from @entity15 have shown signs of toxin
the team now hope to test the tips of older weapons for signs of poison
