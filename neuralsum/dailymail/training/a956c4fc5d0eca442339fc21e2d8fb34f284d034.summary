by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:13 pm on 13th october 2011 saying it 's time to stop letting convicted killers ' get off that easy , ' a @entity5 state lawmaker wants to use firing squads or the electric chair for those on death row			2
rep. @entity10 , 36 , filed a bill this week that would end the use of lethal injection in @entity5 executions			1
instead , those with a death sentence would choose between electrocution or a firing squad			2
' i say let 's end the debate			2
and if that does n't suit the criminal , then we will provide them a .45 - caliber lead cocktail instead , ' @entity10 said			1
@entity5 state rep. @entity10 ( r ) has introduced legislation to bring back the firing squad for executions , an idea he came up with sitting at a @entity32 last month ' there should n't be anything controversial about a .45 - caliber bullet , ' he told the @entity36			1
' if it were up to me , we would just throw them off the @entity40 and be done with it			2
' @entity10 , a @entity42 , said the idea came to him after having a conversation with a constituent at a @entity32 over the legal battles associated with the september 28 execution of @entity48			1
@entity48 's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing that a new lethal drug cocktail would cause him pain and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment			2
courts , however , rejected that argument and let the execution go forward			2
but @entity10 said the person at the restaurant questioned why death row inmates should even be allowed to die by lethal injection			1
@entity10 said he agreed and decided to sponsor the bill that would mandate a switch			1
the @entity42 - controlled @entity64 will consider the bill during the 2012 session that starts in january			0
' there should n't be anything controversial about a .45 - caliber bullet , ' @entity10 said of his plan , even though @entity5 has never used a firing squad before he said government is spending too much time listening to advocacy groups and instead should put in place a death sentence that forces convicted murderers to contemplate their fates			1
the execution of @entity48 , 61 , killed by the new lethal injection cocktail , started @entity10 thinking about ' cruel and unusual punishment ' lethal injection just allows a person to die in their sleep while a firing squad or electrocution would force death row inmates to think about their punishment ' every morning , ' @entity10 said			1
' i think if you ask a hundred people , not even talking to criminals , how would you like to die , if you were drowned , if you were shot , and if you say you were put to sleep , 90 percent of some of the people would say i want to be put to sleep , ' @entity10 said			1
' let 's put our pants back on the right way			0
' @entity5 first began using the electric chair in 1924			0
before then , most executions were carried out by hanging			0
@entity5 has never used firing squads			0
but the state switched to lethal injection in 2000			0
then - gov. @entity109 and the @entity42 - controlled @entity64 pushed through the change after several botched electrocutions raised concerns that the state 's death penalty would be declared unconstitutional			0
the @entity116 @entity115 had agreed at the time to hear a challenge to the use of the electric chair			0
@entity10 also advocates using @entity23 , the @entity5 electric chair seen here			1
@entity5 stopped electrocuting inmates in 2000 and has never used a firing squad since the state made the switch , a total of 26 people have died by lethal injection , including @entity48 and serial killers @entity128 and @entity130			0
the last state to use a firing squad was @entity133 , which executed inmate @entity134 in 2010 , the first death by firing squad in the @entity116 in 14 years			0
the state has stopped using firing squads			0
@entity138 , executive director of the @entity139 of @entity5 , said @entity10 's legislation would just cause embarrassment for @entity5 if it were adopted			1
' just when you thought that public policy in @entity5 could n't get worse , along comes a state rep who develops proposed legislation from what he overhears at the @entity32 , ' @entity138 said			2
' given all that former members of the @entity5 @entity115 and the @entity150 have said about @entity5 's broken death penalty system , including the nation 's highest number of exonerations , this would be embarrassing â€“ if our legislature were capable of embarrassment			0
' but @entity10 said that those who caused suffering and grief for families should get their day of reckoning			1
' i just do n't think they should be able to get off that easy , ' he said .			0

@entity10 penned legislation advocating ' lead cocktail '
