should @entity3 ban @entity1 after latest bite storm ? @entity4 striker @entity1 has until 9pm tonight to produce any evidence to defend his extraordinary biting of @entity7 during the victory over @entity9			1
but there is nothing in the complex @entity3 rulebook preventing @entity1 's shocking previous record for biting opponents being taken into account			1
an expected six - strong independent @entity3 disciplinary committee , chaired by @entity18 's @entity17 , will then decide his fate with the possibility of a decision late tonight			1
@entity3 have to act fast with @entity4 due to play their last sixteen match against @entity23 at the @entity24 on saturday			2
security : @entity4 's team hotel in @entity27 has been surrounded by armed guards in response to the incident decision maker : @entity17 said the incident ' could not be tolerated on any football pitch ' chomping at the bit : @entity1 appears bites @entity7 during @entity4 's 1 - 0 win against @entity9 ouch : @entity7 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity38 bite night ! @entity1 holds his teeth after the biting incident during the @entity41 against @entity7 not fooling anyone : @entity1 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity7 crying foul : @entity7 reacts after being bitten by @entity1 in the 80th minute of the @entity41 match the likelihood is that @entity1 's ban will end his involvement in the tournament , but @entity3 would not speculate about the @entity52 's punishment			1
the disciplinary committee have requested audio and @entity56 evidence of the incident with the super high definition coverage likely to make it glaringly clear that @entity1 was guilty of biting - this time on @entity7 's shoulder - for the third time in his career - despite fanciful claims from the @entity52 federation that the video evidence might have been doctored			1
a @entity3 spokeswoman said : ' the processes are outlined in the disciplinary code , but we can not anticipate what will happen or a precise timeframe			2
but they are fully aware of the urgency with @entity4 still in the competition			0
' they are focusing 100 per cent on the proceedings without any involvement from any other body or @entity3 figure			2
article 118 states if a ban is for less than three matches or upto two months , no appeal is allowed which would rule out the chances of @entity1 using the system to delay his suspension from the tournament			2
but the complicated framework would allow @entity1 to appeal if he is banned for 3 or 4 matches			0
and even if an appeal to @entity3 is ruled out by the size of his punishment , there is still the possibility of an appeal to the @entity96 are on call in @entity18 to add to the difficulties of independence and possible conflicts of interest , @entity17 's @entity18 are still in the tournament			0
meanwhile , the global heads of department at adidas â€™ have held a meeting in @entity107 today about @entity1 and how this latest incident effects them			0
they will give a more detailed response when @entity3 release their findings			0
an adidas spokesperson said : ' adidas is aware of the issue involving @entity1			0
we await @entity3 's full investigation into this matter and will respond accordingly			0
' @entity119 in another bite storm step 1 : @entity1 approaches @entity7 from behind during a @entity4 attack stage 2 : the @entity126 striker moves his head close to @entity7 's shoulder as he prepares to attack stage 3 : @entity1 appears to clamp his jaws down and bite @entity7 's shoulder hot water : @entity1 clutches his teeth after appearing to sink them into @entity7 's shoulder bite marks : @entity7 shows his wounds to the ref after a clash with @entity1			1
