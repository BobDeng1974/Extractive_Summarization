in its prime , a massive steam locomotive known as big boy no. 4014 was a moving eruption of smoke and vapor , a 6,300 - horsepower brute dragging heavy freight trains over the mountains of @entity9 and @entity10			1
it 's been silent for half a century , pushed aside by more efficient diesels , but now it 's coming back to life			2
the @entity15 is embarking on a yearslong restoration project that will put no. 4014 back to work pulling special excursion trains			1
' it 's sort of like going and finding the @entity20 or something that 's just very elusive , nothing that we ever thought would happen , ' said @entity24 , editor of @entity25 , a magazine that covers the railroad industry			2
the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , built 25 of the monsters to @entity15 's specifications between 1941 and 1944 , and they became legendary			1
they were the largest steam locomotives ever to work the rugged terrain of the @entity55 , and by most standards the largest anywhere in the world , said @entity59 , a meticulous historian of @entity15 steam power			1
even the name is legendary			0
an unknown worker scrawled ' big boy ' on the front of one of the engines when it was under construction			2
' it came out one day , and it had " @entity63 " in chalk on it			0
and from that day forward , it was big boy , ' said @entity43 , @entity15 's senior manager of heritage operations , who will oversee the restoration at the railroad 's steam shop in @entity79 , @entity9 @entity43 and his crew recreated the chalk inscription on no. 4014 when they began to move it			1
big boys are 132 feet long , including the tender , which carried coal and water			1
they weigh 1.2 million pounds with a full load of fuel			1
they are essentially two engines under one boiler , with two sets of eight drive wheels , each set powered by two enormous cylinders nearly 2 feet across			2
@entity84 are so big that the front set of drive wheels has to pivot separately from the back set to get around curves			1

@entity84 are so big that the front set of drive wheels has to pivot separately from the back set to get around curves			1
they were designed to run at speeds up to 80mph , but generally did n't exceed 60mph and generated the most horsepower at 35mph			2
and they are n't just big , @entity59 said			0
they were engineered to reach 80 mph , even though the railroad never intended to run them that fast			0
the point was to fine - tune the locomotives so they stayed in balance at any speed and did n't beat themselves up with their own powerful forces			0
' you get all that machinery to live in harmony , ' @entity59 said			0
their enormous bulk also hid some slick engineering , including a suspension system that kept the drive wheels pressed against the rails when the locomotive straddled hills or valleys			0
seventeen @entity84 were scrapped when they were pulled from service , but eight survived and are on display around the country			1
@entity15 chose the 4014 for restoration because it spent more than 50 years in the friendly climate of @entity35 , at the @entity183 at the @entity184			1
the museum took good care of the locomotive , @entity43 said , and many of the original components are usable			0
@entity183 agreed to give the @entity63 back to the @entity15 in exchange for some other equipment to display			1
no. 4014 has been moved from the museum to a @entity15 shop in @entity194 , @entity195 , where a crew is preparing to tow it across @entity197 , @entity10 and @entity9 to @entity79 , arriving may 8			1
the @entity15 maintains two other working steam locomotives there , and @entity43 and his crew of seven can manufacture almost anything they need			1
' this equipment , nobody 's going to come in and fix it when it breaks down , ' he said			0
' restoration is expected to take three to five years			1
the railroad would like to have the @entity63 operating by 2019 for the 150th anniversary of the driving of the @entity214 in @entity10 , which linked the @entity15 with the @entity215 and completed the first transcontinental railroad			2
it 's too early to predict where the restored locomotive will travel			0
railroad officials said they will have to choose the routes carefully to make sure bridges and tunnels can handle the @entity63 's weight and size			0
overjoyed railroad fans are following closely			0
@entity24 heard from an @entity55 soldier serving overseas who was watching live video of the project			0
people have offered to donate money or even buy lunch for the @entity15 steam crew , @entity43 said , but he allowed that the @entity236 , @entity237 - based railroad — no. 138 on the @entity239 list — can afford the project on its own			2
@entity43 declined to say how much restoration will cost			0
it might be less than people think , he said , because the railroad can do much of the work in - house			0
pouring money into a 73 - year - old mechanical relic makes good marketing sense , said @entity250 , a digital and social media marketing expert who also teaches at @entity253			0
' nearly everyone has a fascination with trains , ' @entity250 said in an email to @entity258			0
" giving people an image that immediately calls to mind so many good things about an industry and brand is a smart marketing move			0
