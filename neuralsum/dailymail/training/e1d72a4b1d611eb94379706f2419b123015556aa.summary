a new study from the @entity2 psychologist @entity1 shows how online social media , rather than making us feel connected , contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life - satisfaction			1
@entity7 may have 1.1 billion users across the globe , but according to the study , the technology is having a fundamentally negative effect on the way we interact with others , and the way we perceive ourselves			2
the study 's 82 participants were text messaged five times a day over a two - week period with a link to an online survey about their @entity7 use , their feelings of well - being and the amount of face - to - face social interaction they had engaged in			2
missed connections : a new study shows that the more people use @entity7 , the less satisfied they feel with their lives and social interactions @entity1 and his team discovered that the more time participants had spent on @entity7 , the less happy they felt over time			1
' the more people used @entity7 at one time point , the worse they felt the next time we text - messaged them ; the more they used @entity7 over two weeks , the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time , ' reports the study			1
these results were not moderated by the amount of @entity7 friends , the perceived supportiveness of the @entity7 connections , motivation for using @entity7 , gender , loneliness , self - esteem , or depression , according to the study			1
@entity1 says the study shows that @entity7 was making the participants unhappy			1
he notes that other , cross-sectional studies have revealed positive associations with @entity7 use , but notes that his is the first to study subjective well - being over time			1
networking : studies show that the more time people spend online , the less face - to - face interactions they engage in loneliness and social interaction in a world where we 're increasingly connected is a growing problem			1
increased feelings of isolation and a decreased sense of well - being seems connected with the way in which we use social media , such as @entity7 or @entity67 : passively or actively			2
a 2010 study from @entity69 in @entity70 found that when interacting directly with friends on @entity7 - whether posting messages or pictures on wall , tagging photos or ' liking ' things , feelings of well - being and sociability increased			1
but when they passively consumed content on @entity7 , the opposite was true			0
an earlier study from the same researcher found that increased internet use led to a decline in communications with friends and family , and increased depression and loneliness			0
earlier this year , author @entity91 wrote in the @entity92 on the issue			0
' technology celebrates connectedness , but encourages retreat , ' he wrote			0
' each step " forward " has made it easier , just a little , to avoid the emotional work of being present , to convey information rather than humanity			0
' isolated : although we are more connected that ever before , we are increasingly physically isolated by technology the @entity105 , too , weighed in on the issue in april 2012			0
' we are living in an isolation that would have been unimaginable to our ancestors , and yet we have never been more accessible , ' wrote @entity109			0
the passive consumption of other people 's lives over social media - their idealized pictures of holidays , work , meals and family - seem to result in a more negative perception of our own lives and social interactions			0
@entity1 ' study concludes , ' on the surface , @entity7 provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection			0
rather than enhancing well - being , however , these findings suggest that @entity7 may undermine it			2

a new study shows that @entity7 use can undermine well - being and increase loneliness
the study found that the more time people spent on @entity7 , the less happy they felt over time
