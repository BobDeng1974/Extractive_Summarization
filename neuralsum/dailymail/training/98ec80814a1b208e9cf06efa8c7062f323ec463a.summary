@entity0 has been accused of ' betraying ' the family of her adopted daughter @entity3 - as they issued a desperate plea to be allowed to see her			1
the grandparents of @entity7 have accused the star of cutting them out of her life and failing to meet a promise to keep her close to her roots			1
they also attacked ' white foreigners ' for taking children away from @entity16			1
@entity17 , grandfather of @entity7 who was adopted by @entity0 in 2009 , told @entity18 : ' nobody has told me a thing about @entity3 being in the country or about her welfare since she left us			1
' she has my blood flowing in her veins			1
it is preposterous that i am not made aware of anything regarding her development			0
' the 69 - year - old , who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall , added that @entity0 had , ' broken my heart and hearts of my family members , ' saying that , ' she has shown no humanity at all towards us			1
' ' betrayal ' : the grandparents of @entity7 , pictured in the straw hat with @entity0 on her visit to @entity44 yesterday , have accused the star of reneging on a promise to let them see her regrets : @entity17 , @entity7 ' grandfather , told @entity18 he bitterly regrets agreeing to allow @entity0 to adopt his granddaughter thriving : @entity7 , pictured yesterday on her visit to @entity44 , was adopted in 2009 by @entity0 after a @entity50 agreed that the star did not need to be resident in @entity44 for 18months prior to becoming a parent , but her family are upset that they have not seen her since bitter : @entity3 's 69 - year - old grandfather , who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall , told @entity18 that the first time he heard @entity7 was in the country was via @entity18 and in newspaper reports @entity17 originally backed @entity0 's bid to adopt his granddaughter because he believed she would get a good education , and convinced his reluctant ex-wife to agree the adoption papers			1
but today , as @entity0 visits @entity44 with @entity7 , he said he bitterly regrets his decision and accused @entity0 of kidnapping a child of @entity16			1
he said : ' @entity71 foreigners who decide to take our children away from @entity16 have no understanding of our culture			1
' they do n't realise that in our @entity16 families each one has a responsibility to the others			0
if a half - brother or half - sister does well , they share their fortunes with all of the others			0
' a child like my granddaughter @entity3 , if she succeeds in her career , she is expected to share that success with all of us			1
that is how our extended family system works			0
' because of that system , he believed @entity3 was being given the chance of a lifetime to travel to @entity96 for her schooling and would then return to help her family in @entity16			1
' i worked for a household years ago where a foreign lady took one of the children to be educated and brought up abroad , and that child came back as a doctor and improved the lives of every member of the family			0
that is what persuaded me to let @entity3 go			1
' now i see that all she meant was that she would bring her here on holiday , stay in an expensive lodge for foreigners , and cut us – her real blood family – out of her life			1
that can not be the right way to do things			0
no foreigner has the right to interfere in our culture like this			0
' his thoughts were echoed by his ex-wife @entity129 , also 69 , who fears she may never see her granddaughter again			0
' i am now old and sickly , ' she said			0
' i do n't want to die before seeing my daughter			0
' @entity129 and @entity17 's teenage daughter died days after @entity3 's birth and so the family placed her at the orphanage because they could not take care of her			1
a tearful @entity129 said : ' we planned to take her back when she reached the age of six when she could eat solid food			0
but we were told a rich lady wanted to adopt her			0
we resisted at first but government officials convinced us this was good for @entity145 's future			0
we never thought we will not see our daughter again			0
@entity17 says he now bitterly regrets signing the papers that allowed the 56 - year - old pop star to adopt @entity3 , whose teenage mother @entity149 , died days after giving birth			1
' by putting a distance between @entity3 and me and members of my family , she is being extremely unfair			2
@entity0 , pictured with children @entity7 and @entity157 yesterday , both nine , who she adopted from the @entity16 nation , has already helped to fund 10 schools in the country and her charitable efforts are not yet finished visiting @entity44 : @entity0 brought @entity7 to @entity163 village , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) from the @entity164 in april 2010 but @entity3 did not see her family then ' please let us see our daughter ' : @entity17 , @entity7 ' grandfather , pictured over the weekend , just wants to see his granddaughter poverty : the grandfather of @entity7 , @entity17 , pictured this weekend , ekes out a living selling pots but is not looking for any handout from @entity0 , he says he simply wants to see @entity3 anger : @entity157 , @entity0 's first adopted child , saw his father on a visit to the orphanage where he used to live during the visit to @entity44 last week ' we are extremely poor , but we do not need her money , ' he added			1
' a simple acknowledgement that we exist , that we are humans with feelings and that we do not wish to be disconnected from our child will be enough			0
' what has happened to our family should be a lesson to anyone who may be approached by @entity0 with promises to make lives of children better			1
' his guilt is compounded because it was he who convinced his reluctant family to let @entity3 go			2
his now estranged wife , @entity194 , fought to keep @entity3 as a court battle raged over her fate four years ago			2
@entity194 said : ' i did n't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that @entity3 should go			2
' the men insisted that @entity3 be adopted and i wo n't resist anymore			2
' now @entity17 says he made a mistake when he facilitated @entity0 's adoption of @entity3 some four years ago			1
he has never accepted money from @entity0 and is not looking for any - he says he simply wants to see his daughter			2
' we did not donate our child to @entity0			2
we let @entity0 have our child because we were told she is a philanthropist who would help give her a good education			1
' what is the point of us wanting @entity3 to get a good education and a good life if in the end she does not help her relatives ? ' with her adopted children @entity7 and @entity157 , also nine , the material girl has been visiting the east @entity16 nation to see the efforts of her charity @entity220 , first hand			1
her 14 - year - old son @entity222 also joined them on visits to schools and hospitals in the country where she funds a number of orphanages , including @entity230 in the western border district of @entity232 where she adopted @entity157 , and @entity233 in the southern tea - growing district of @entity236			0
on friday the pop legend met with @entity164 president @entity238 at the country 's @entity239 and later announced her plans to build 300 schools across @entity44			2
she also found time for @entity157 to visit his father @entity243 , who farms tomatoes and maize in the central border district of @entity232			0
looking to adopt again ? @entity0 , centre , poses for a picture yesterday with children in @entity250 , about 150 kilometers north of the @entity164 capital @entity164 charity work : @entity0 poses for a picture with children in @entity250 yesterday , about 150 kilometers north of the @entity164 capital @entity164 , where she has been working since 2006 with her non profit organization , raising @entity44 forgiven : @entity0 had her ' @entity256 ' status restored by @entity44 after being called ' arrogant ' by the country 's president in april last year			1
yesterday she played with her daughter @entity3 as the girl 's family issued a plea to see her ' you have grown so big , ' @entity262 told his son as they bonded over a game of football			1
@entity157 , who has since remarried and has another son , brought his son some gifts , including groundnuts and onions , in keeping with @entity164 custom			0
but the news of this visit has only added to the heartbreak for @entity3 's grandmother			2
' why do they always take the other child ( @entity157 ) to his people and not @entity145 to us , ' @entity129 asked , using her @entity164 name which translates to @entity3			2
' what 's the difference ? is it because the other one is a boy why my daughter is a girl ? ' she added that she fought to keep @entity3 as a court battle raged over her fate five years ago			1
after protracted legal wrangling @entity0 was allowed to keep @entity3 , who she spotted during a visit to an orphanage with her then husband @entity296 in 2006			1
@entity3 's uncle , @entity297 - who also signed off @entity3 's adoption papers in 2009 - said he was not sure whether or not he regretted signing off the papers			2
he said : ' i met @entity0 in court and she assured me she would be bringing back my niece every other two years			2
was she lying to me ? this was in court			0
' government officials are my witness for they were translating our conversation			0
' @entity297 , a tobacco farmer , said he does n't know how to explain the situation to the family			0
he said : ' they are all looking to me for answers because i am the one who signed the papers			0
what should i be telling them ? ' @entity297 also said that @entity3 has a lot of cousins who want to see her - but are confused by her new life of luxury			0
he said : ' we tell them they have a cousin who is living oversees with a famous rich woman			0
they wonder why this famous rich woman should allow them to live in abject poverty while their cousin is living big			0
' this is not good for @entity3 herself			1
what will she think when she discovers her people are wallowing in poverty ? ' a representative for @entity0 had not responded to requests for comment by the time of publication .			0

@entity7 ' grandparents say they are desperate to see their little girl
they accuse star of betraying promise to keep her close to her roots
grandfather : ' she has my blood flowing in her veins , i want to see her '
' @entity71 foreigners who take our children have no understanding of our culture '
discovered @entity3 was in @entity44 thanks to @entity18 and newspapers
@entity0 ' is giving @entity3 good schooling but we want to see her '
