by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 came to @entity4 yesterday — not the daft costumes and dubious singing , but the embarrassment of ‘ nil points ’ for @entity9 , on their @entity11 return			1
this was a chastening occasion for the promoted exiles and for the competition as a whole			2
the numbers added up to a low - key mismatch , as @entity19 rattled along to their first half - century in the top division , in front of a meagre crowd of just 2,776 spectators , despite new - season optimism and blue skies over the @entity26			1
the @entity11 rightly prides itself on the abundance of close contests it produces , but this was a procession from the 11th minute , when @entity33 ’s @entity32 struck for the first of their seven tries			1
by failing to trouble the scorers at their own ground , @entity9 suffered the same indignity as @entity40 on the opening weekend last season , when @entity42 left @entity43 with 21 unanswered points			1
debut to remember : @entity45 celebrates his first try in @entity48 colours two years ago , the @entity14 marked their arrival among the elite with a respectable 38 - 13 defeat at home to @entity53 , followed by a 40 - 3 thrashing against @entity55 in @entity56			1
but they followed those initial setbacks with a 25 - 24 victory in this fixture — a world away from yesterday ’s outcome			2
not even the presence of a @entity66 - winning @entity65 in their ranks , scrum half @entity62 ( below ) , could stem the tide			2
@entity69 , who strove to prepare @entity9 for the struggle against relegation this season by recruiting 25 new players over the summer , must hope the acclimatisation process is mercifully brief			1
powerful : @entity45 clatters into @entity9 ' @entity62 with a thunderous tackle after this drubbing , he said : ‘ we have to learn from @entity77 are 10 months of the season to go and we knew what we were getting into			1
we can either go home and hide away or we can stick our chests out , get the smile back on our faces , get back into training and keep working hard			2
we ’re at @entity42 next so it does n’t get easier			0
’ reflecting on his side ’s defeat , @entity69 added : ‘ we squandered opportunities by spilling the ball and @entity19 were quick to capitalise on our turn - overs			0
when people make individual errors , it is not about a lack of cohesion or the new signings			0
we have to make our tackles , make the final pass and hold on to it			0
’ end in sight : @entity101 races clear to score a try for the @entity48 against @entity9 while @entity9 were easy prey , @entity19 were convincing as they went through their high - octane attacking repertoire			1
fly half @entity106 under - pinned their performance with seven kicks from as many attempts — not to mention some nifty footwork and distribution — but this was a collective demonstration of slick running and inter-play			0
new signing @entity45 , the former @entity118 no 8 , began the procession by scoring his side ’s first two tries on his competitive debut			1
first , his off - load sent @entity125 darting clear in midfield and after @entity106 maintained the momentum , his pass released @entity45 in the 22 and he blasted over the line			2
his second try came in the 27th minute , after @entity130 had held @entity106 up over the line on the left			0
it was 17 - 0 at the break , but the dam burst in the second half			0
@entity139 capped a fine display from blindside flanker by rumbling in for the @entity32 ’ third try , then centre @entity137 slalomed clear to strike			0
way ahead : @entity143 gets himself way ahead of the opposition players to score get in there : @entity143 celebrates his first - half try for the @entity48 on the move : @entity48 ' @entity149 races clear to score a try against @entity9 celebrations : @entity149 scores a try during the game at the @entity26 dejected : @entity9 drudge off the field disappointed after their opening game thrashing on the hour , from a short - range lineout on the left , @entity101 burst forward and bounced off two tackles to touch down			1
seconds later @entity143 claimed a clearance and spun out of a tackle to run to the posts , before full back @entity149 rounded off the rout by storming through heavy traffic and swerving to finish			0
for @entity9 , this represented a grim early glimpse of the struggle they face in the months ahead , but for @entity19 it was an encouraging indication they have the firepower and daring intent to emerge as top - half contenders this season			2
‘ the conditioners have got our guys in great nick during the summer and we were able to impose our game , ’ said coach @entity175			0
‘ there were times in the first half when we could have been more ruthless but it was pleasing to get a bonus - point win in the first game of the season			0

@entity48 thrash @entity9 at the @entity26
@entity45 scored two tries on his debut for the *visitors*
