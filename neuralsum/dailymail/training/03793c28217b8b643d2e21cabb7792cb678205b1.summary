a little boy made a powerful argument as to why he should have a cupcake for dinner - and the video his mother took of him making it went viral			1
three - year - old @entity7 did n't want to eat dinner			1
he felt that since he 'd already eaten lunch , a cupcake would make a suitable compromise			0
when this argument failed to win over his mother @entity13 , he decided he might have better luck with his grandmother			1
this time , @entity21 happened to have her phone with her so she hit record just as @entity7 got into his stride			2
@entity7 , looking up at his mother and unaware he 's being filmed , entreats his mother to ' listen to me , listen to me , listen to me ! ' while most of the argument is unintelligible , the gist seems to be that he deserves a cupcake and definitely not ' pow pows in the butt [ a spanking ]			1
' increasingly desperate : despite @entity7 's arguments , his mother does not agree , leading to further reasoning his love for his little brother @entity39 is admirable , too			2
@entity13 says that she 's going to have to spank both @entity7 and @entity39 , but @entity7 says she should n't spank him , nor his little brother			1
' but he 's my little @entity41 ! ' he says			0
the video goes for two minutes and 35 seconds , but arguably the most hilarious part comes at 1:42 , when he begins to refer to his mother as ' honey			2
' ' @entity13 , honey , honey , lookit , look at this , ' he says			2
@entity21 says @entity7 calls her @entity13 when he is very serious and wants to make sure she is paying attention			1
' @entity13 , honey , honey ' : even in the face of such convincing sweet - talk , @entity13 does n't give in to her son he began using his parents ' first names after the family went on a trip to a theme park and came across a little boy who had lost his family			1
he did n't know his parents ' names , other than @entity63 and @entity64 , and @entity21 and her husband realized their children might not know their names either , in a similar situation			0
knowing his parents first names , @entity21 said , ' made @entity7 feel a little empowered			0
' ' for the most part we are still mommy and @entity64 , but when he is serious and wants to make sure we are paying attention , we quickly become @entity13 and @entity75 , ' she told @entity77 blog			0
@entity21 says @entity7 is never disrespectful , but loves to engage in healthy debate			0
' the boys know when mom is serious and when they can engage in some healthy debate			0
in an effort to raise my kids with a voice , i pick my battles and sometimes let them feel like they â€™ve won ... or at least give them the chance to try ! '			0
