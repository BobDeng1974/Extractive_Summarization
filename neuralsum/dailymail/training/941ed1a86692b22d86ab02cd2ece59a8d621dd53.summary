by @entity0 a mother and daughter locked in a bitter £ 150,000 court battle over the family estate agency have had their claims thrown out by a judge			1
@entity8 , 71 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , had been sued by @entity11 , 40 , who claimed her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave			1
a stream of angry letters then culminated in mrs @entity8 making a complaint to police and the arrest of her daughter ’s innocent business partner , who was held in a police cell for five hours			2
family feud : @entity8 ( left ) , 71 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , had been sued by @entity11 ( right ) , 40 , who claimed her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave in a counter-claim , mrs @entity8 , a postmistress and boss of @entity27 lettings agency , sued her daughter for £ 100,000 for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients			1
mrs @entity11 , who now runs @entity32 , and her business partner @entity33 , accused mrs @entity8 of harassment and asked for £ 50,000 damages			2
last friday - after an 11 - day @entity37 hearing - judge @entity36 lamented the ‘ most unhappy family discord ’ and dismissed both mother and daughter ’s claims			1
criticising mrs @entity8 ’s behaviour in making a ‘ malicious ’ complaint to police , the judge said there was ‘ no obvious reason ’ for taking legal action against her daughter ‘ other than spite ’ after relations between the two women fell down in 2010 and their business relationship parted , mrs @entity8 contacted @entity54 to accuse mrs @entity33 of thieving			2
the judge said : ‘ the contents of the police statement strike me as outrageous			0
it contained a number of bare - faced lies			0
office : mrs @entity8 , a postmistress and boss of @entity27 lettings agency ( pictured ) in @entity9 , @entity10 , sued her daughter for £ 100,000 for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients ‘ mrs @entity8 was setting out not merely to be mischievious , but malicious , in making complaints to the police which she must have know were totally without any justification			1
‘ it reflects further discredit upon her that she was also fairly obviously seeking to implicate her daughter in the allegations of theft against mrs @entity33			0
the whole strategy was extremely nasty			0
' the decision of @entity10 police even to investigate the complaints of mrs @entity8 , still less to arrest mrs @entity33 , was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned ' judge @entity36 @entity79 ‘ it is obvious that , by making her complaint to the police , mrs @entity8 was setting out to cause trouble for mrs @entity33 and also , if possible , for mrs @entity11			1
’ and criticising the local force , the judge added : ‘ the decision of @entity10 police even to investigate the complaints of mrs @entity8 , still less to arrest mrs @entity33 , was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned			1
‘ mrs @entity33 was detained for some five hours after her arrest before being released on bail			0
’ in february 2010 , mrs @entity8 told mrs @entity11 that she would receive only her statutory minimum maternity pay just a few days after the caesarean delivery of her grandson , @entity92			1
that was a ‘ dramatic reduction ’ in @entity95 ’ usual salary , said the judge			2
the younger woman was furious and the incident was a crucial factor in her decision to set up @entity32 in direct rivalry to her mother			0
thrown out : after an 11 - day hearing at @entity105 's @entity37 ( pictured ) - judge @entity36 lamented the ' most unhappy family discord ' and dismissed both mother and daughter 's claims the court heard mrs @entity11 had been managing director of @entity27 , owning 45 per cent of the shares , and her mother , who founded the business , had always intended that her daughter should eventually take full control			1
however , @entity116 , for mrs @entity11 , said that , by the time she gave birth to @entity92 , her mother had ‘ wanted to take her out of the equation ’			0
' mrs @entity8 was setting out not merely to be mischievious , but malicious , in making complaints to the police which she must have know were totally without any justification ' judge @entity36 @entity79 mrs @entity8 accused her daughter of making use of confidential company information to ‘ pinch ’ many of her best clients , but the judge ruled that mrs @entity11 had in no way breached her employment contract or duties as a director			1
also dismissing mrs @entity11 ’s harassment claim , the judge said some of her accusations against her mother were ‘ frankly ludicrous ’			2
‘ @entity138 , annoying , unattractive or unreasonable ’ behaviour could not , by itself , amount to harassment , nor could the ‘ manoeuvring for commercial advantage ’ that would be expected in the estate agency industry , the judge said			0
he said he was ‘ entirely satisfied ’ that mrs @entity8 ’s complaint to the police against mrs @entity33 , who formerly worked for @entity27 , was ‘ malicious ’ and made ‘ with a view to causing alarm , distress and anxiety ’			0
but that single incident , he ruled , was not a ‘ course of conduct ’ that could be called harassment .			0

@entity8 , 71 , of @entity10 , sued by daughter @entity11 , 40
@entity11 claimed @entity8 reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave
low also sued @entity11 for setting up new agency and ' stealing clients '
judge laments ' most unhappy family discord ' and dismisses both claims
