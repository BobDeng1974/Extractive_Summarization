@entity2 tanks could soon be allowed to drive at 40mph again on public roads in @entity4 and @entity5 , it has been revealed			0
they had been driving at this speed since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from laws restricting tracked vehicles to 20mph			1
the top speed was therefore halved to 20mph in october 2013 to comply with the 1984 @entity13 , but the @entity14 is now proposing to put it back to 40mph			1
new limit ? @entity17 tracked vehicles had been driving at 40mph since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from road traffic laws ( file picture ) ministers are worried that the 20mph limit is causing more congestion and raising possible safety concerns , as well as preventing proper training of tank crews to operate safely on public roads			1
they also believe travelling at slow speeds increases the vibrations of some tanks which can harm the health of crews over long periods , as well as causing wear and tear on roads and the vehicles			2
the @entity14 , which is now consulting on plans to raise the limit , added that actual operating speeds would still depend on careful risk assessments by the military and specific vehicle capabilities			1
@entity46 vehicles such as the @entity48 self - propelled gun and @entity50 missile carrier can often be seen on rural roads close to army firing ranges in @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ the plans under consultation will help address congestion that can be created by slow - moving vehicles on faster roads			1
‘ increasing the maximum speed limit to 40mph will also reduce costs of higher fuel consumption and the time taken for training and testing when vehicles are limited to 20mph			1
’ frequent sight : tracked vehicles can often be seen on rural roads close to army firing ranges in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity53 - where a challenger tank at @entity73 is pictured in this file image the consultation runs until april 24			2
@entity77 director professor @entity76 said : ‘ it seems our armed forces need more practice at , literally , rapid deployment			0
‘ with troops now out of @entity85 it makes you wonder what target military chiefs are eyeing up next ? ’ he added : ‘ but tank commanders should beware			0
while they will theoretically be allowed to go faster , congestion might mean they never get near the limit as they are stuck in the same jams as the rest of @entity96 's 38 million drivers			2
‘ but at least they 'll be in the right vehicles to tackle the potholes that blight the road network			0
’ the consultation was published last friday by transport minister @entity101 and @entity102 , the defence equipment minister			0
last week @entity104 mayor @entity103 outlined eight locations in the capital where 20mph speed limits could be introduced , with more possibly following .			0

@entity17 tracked vehicles had been driving at up to 40mph since 1977
but it *emerged* in 2013 they were not exempt from tracked vehicle laws
limit was then halved to 20mph , but @entity14 now wants to raise it to 40mph
ministers believe 20mph limit is causing congestion and health concerns
