by @entity1 reporter published : 19:52 est , 8 july 2012 updated : 04:34 est , 9 july 2012 if you can not get on the internet today , there may be a good reason why - the @entity6 might be shutting you down			2
the @entity8 law enforcement agency will be blocking up to 500,000 users around the world who have a malicious program installed on their computer			1
it will affect anyone who inadvertantly downloaded a piece of ' malware ' called @entity17 , which redirects users to fake advertising websites			1
internet shutdown : software called @entity22 attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on monday internet providers have plans to help their customers on monday and others are braced for calls to helplines because thousands around the country whose computers were infected with malicious software more than a year ago faced the possibility of not being able to get online			1
the @entity6 is taking the unusual step in a bid to shut down @entity17 , thought to have been created by @entity39 cyber-criminals			1
it is not known how many computers in the @entity42 are affected , but 12 per cent of the top 500 @entity8 companies are said to have infected pcs or @entity45			1
some providers may put technical solutions in place that will correct the server problem that could hit some computers after midnight edt sunday			2
it they do , the @entity51 will work , but the malware will remain on victims ' computers and could pose future problems , said @entity57 , an @entity6 supervisory special agent			2
if you are worried about the impending meltdown , follow these steps : 1 ) visit this @entity6 - approved site - http://www.dns-ok.us - and see if you get an ' all - clear ' green background or an ' at risk ' red background			0
2 ) if you have a red background , visit http://www.dcwg.org/fix which lists free virus scanner and removal software			0
our personal recommendations from the free range are @entity71 and @entity72			0
for more information , visit here : http://www.dcwg.org/detect / the @entity6 arranged for a private company to run a website - http://www.dcwg.org - as a place where computer users could go to see if their computer was infected and find links to other computer security business sites where they could find fixes for the problem			1
from the onset , most victims did n't even know their computers were infected , although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software , making their machines more vulnerable to other problems			1
many computer users do n't understand the complex machines they use every day to send email , shop , and cruise for information			1
the cyberworld of viruses , malware , bank fraud and internet scams is often distant and confusing , and warning messages may go unseen or unheeded			0
@entity106 , chief executive of @entity107 , which makes a free piece of software designed to remove the malware , said : ' the @entity6 left the criminal servers running to give infected users time to remove this piece of malware , however it is estimated there are still hundreds of thousands of people who just do n't know they are infected			1
' monday is d - day because anyone who still has this piece of malware on their computer simply wo n't be able to access the internet			0
' this means people will struggle to repair the problem because they wo n't be able to download removal tools or access information through the infected laptop or computer			1
' the total cost could be significant			0
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we 've been using the last eight months to go out and clean up the infected computers , but we do n't have everybody			1
' to the rescue : for those who did n't check the site designed to inform users if they are infected ( pictured ) , internet providers have plans to help their customers on monday and others are braced for calls experts are taking the warning seriously , but in reference to the @entity147 which supposedly threatened to shut @entity42 down , one blogger wrote : ‘ yet another ploy to get everyone freaked out … remember @entity150			2
’ there is an underlying sense that this will be much ado about nothing , such as the approach of 2000			0
the transition to that year presented technical problems and fears that some computers would stop working because they were not set up for the date change			0
in the end there were very few problems			0
considering there are millions of @entity51 users across the country , several thousand is n't a big deal , unless you 're one of them			0
rep. @entity169 , @entity170 , and co-founder of @entity173 ' cybersecurity caucus , said computer users have a responsibility to practice good sense and make sure their computers are not infected or being hijacked by criminals			2
' these types of issues are only going to increase as our society relies more and more on the @entity51 , so it is a reminder that everyone can do their part , ' he said			0
@entity6 officials have been tracking the number of computers they believe still may be infected by the malware			2
as of wednesday , there were about 45,600 in the @entity8 - nearly 20,000 less than a week ago			1
worldwide , the total is roughly 250,000 infected			2
the numbers have declined steadily , and recent efforts by internet service providers may limit the problems on monday			0
if you see your computer is n't functioning properly throughout the day today , customer support lines could be your best solution .			0
