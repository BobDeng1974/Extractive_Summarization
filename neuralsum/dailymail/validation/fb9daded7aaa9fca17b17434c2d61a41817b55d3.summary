@entity0 stated in an interview on wednesday that he thinks being gay is ' absolutely ' a choice			1
the potential @entity5 presidential candidate then used the example of prisoners to provide support for his statement			2
' because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight — and when they come out , they ’re gay , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay			2
' so did something happen while they were in there ? ' he said			0
' ask yourself that question			0
' he then went in on the issue of gay marriage			1
' why do gay people want to get married ? why do they say they want to get married ? because they want to have various rights -- property rights , visitation rights , ' he said			0
' why ca n't any two human beings , i do n't care what their sexual orientation is , why ca n't they have the legal right to do those things ? that does not require changing the definition of marriage			0
' for this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level , this on the same day the @entity60 ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples			1
@entity0 is in favor of civil unions			0
@entity0 has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech			1
in an interview with @entity76 , @entity0 said ; ' my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman			1
it 's a well - established , fundamental pillar of society and no group , be they gays , be they @entity87 , be they people who believe in bestiality			2
it does n't matter what they are			0
' he continued by saying ; ' they do n't get to change the definition			0
so he , it 's not something that is against gays , it 's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society			0
' the comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point @entity0 has come across as an affable and moderate @entity5 in a series of interviews			2
the backlash was so strong , especially among @entity113 , that @entity0 was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater @entity116			1
earlier this week @entity0 launched an exploratory committee to run for president , becoming the first high - profile @entity5 candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race .			1
