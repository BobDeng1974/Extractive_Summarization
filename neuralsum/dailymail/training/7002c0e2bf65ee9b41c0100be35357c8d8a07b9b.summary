by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the disclosure over the @entity3 is a ' fresh embarrassment for the archbishop of @entity6 , the most reverend @entity5 , pictured the @entity7 , is paying more than 70 of its own workers less than the living wage - despite lecturing employers about their duty to pay higher salaries			1
the care and cleaning staff , employed running sheltered housing schemes for retired clergy , earn less than the ‘ living wage ’ which the @entity7 urges all companies to pay			1
the living wage is supposed to ensure that families can afford food , clothes and rent			2
the disclosure is a fresh embarrassment for the archbishop of @entity6 , the most reverend @entity5 , following the scandal over the @entity7 ’s investment in the controversial payday lender @entity30			0
archbishop @entity5 is a strong backer of the @entity7 ’s campaign to encourage employers to pay the living wage , which was calculated with the help of its own poverty campaigners , under the supervision of the @entity5 , the most reverend @entity39			1
the living wage is currently set at £ 8.55 an hour in @entity41 and £ 7.45 in the rest of the country			1
the @entity7 has declared that families can not afford food , clothing or housing if their income is lower , and that it is ‘ morally unacceptable that people should have to do multiple jobs and work long hours and yet still live in poverty ’			0
archbishop @entity5 said in november 2012 , just before he took over at @entity52 , that championing the living wage was something ‘ we should be shouting about			2
’ however the @entity7 ’s parliament , the @entity56 , has now been told that one of the @entity7 ’s own institutions has failed to listen to the message			0
moreover , it will not begin to improve the low pay of its care workers until next spring			1
dr @entity62 of the @entity7 ’s cabinet , the @entity65 ’ council , told the @entity56 : ‘ in its supported housing scheme the @entity66 employs 72 staff who are currently below the living wage			1
‘ the @entity66 will implement the living wage in stages , starting april 2015			2
’ dr @entity78 added ‘ most staff ’ working for contractors used by the @entity7 are paid the living wage , and ‘ where they are not , agreement has been reached to phase in the appropriate uplift or , in one case , offer additional funds to an existing contractor to make the necessary uplift			1
’ the former archbishop of @entity84 , who retired at the end of 2012 , has made plain his strong support for the living wage for care workers			1
in an interview earlier this year he said it was wrong that care workers are often paid only the minimum wage of £ 6.31 an hour			1
paying the living wage was a ‘ no brainer ’ , lord @entity84 said , adding : ‘ on that sort of salary you have to have three jobs to make ends meet , and rushing from the one to the other is disastrous			2
’ the @entity7 ’s most outspoken campaigner for the living wage has been the archbishop of york , the most reverend @entity39			1
dr @entity39 said last year that ‘ the holes in millions of pay cheques are being plugged by in - work support to the tune of £ 4 billion a year			0
but why are n’t those who are profiting from their workers paying up ? why is the government having to subsidise businesses which do n’t pay their employees enough to live on ? @entity7 investment chiefs finally withdrew their £ 75,000 stake in @entity30 earlier this month , almost a year after archbishop @entity5 first complained of his embarrassment at the @entity7 ’s involvement			2
he added : ‘ in the rush for profit , and for high pay at the top , too many companies have forgotten the basic moral imperative that employees be paid enough to live on			0
’ the @entity7 ’s highest paid staff member is general synod secretary - general @entity124 , who is on over £ 150,000 a year , more than the prime minister			0
since the @entity7 is a charity , this salary puts mr @entity124 among the very best rewarded charity executives			0
the 72 pensions board workers on less than the living wage are employed in eight supported housing schemes for elderly and vulnerable clergy , their spouses , and other @entity7 retired staff , which are established around the country			1
each couple accommodated pays around £ 2,000 a month for places in communities where low - paid staff provide meals , cleaning and personal care			2
@entity7 investment chiefs finally withdrew their £ 75,000 stake in @entity30 earlier this month , almost a year after archbishop @entity5 first complained of his embarrassment at the @entity7 ’s involvement			0
the @entity7 ’s financial arm , the @entity144 , pulled out of the payday lender only under pressure from the archbishop , who wants to see high interest short term loan firms replaced by @entity7 - backed low interest credit unions			0
the @entity150 had said they intended to maintain the @entity30 investment , part of a stake in a venture capital company , because it would cost between £ 3 million and £ 9 million to get rid of it			0
the commissioners also said that @entity7 investment would improve the behaviour of questionable companies , adding that ‘ it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick			0
’ their discovery that the money could after all be pulled from @entity30 without large financial losses came less that two weeks after the @entity166 revealed their intention to continue with the investment .			0
