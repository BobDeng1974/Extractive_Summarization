although his three - year tour of duty is not due to end until september , with the @entity11 due to give birth in july , he could leave the @entity4 within weeks			1
this would give him extended paternity leave before starting the next stage of his career			1
according to the @entity19 , sources close to the @entity18 , 30 , said he has not yet made up his mind on his immediate future			2
his options include continuing to fly , transferring elsewhere within the @entity23 or completely ending his military career			0
