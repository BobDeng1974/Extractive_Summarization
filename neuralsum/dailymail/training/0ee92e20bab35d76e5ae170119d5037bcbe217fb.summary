@entity4 , 19 , was struck down with a series of life - threatening allergic reactions called anaphylactic shocks beginning in may 2013			1
she suffered from a mystery illness that caused her to lose her hair and be rushed to hospital more than 30 times in 12 months			1
@entity4 , 19 , has become the champion of @entity14 - despite suffering from a rare condition which means she can suffer a severe allergic reaction if she gets too hot or sweaty miss @entity4 is allergic to exercise , and was rushed to hospital suffering an anaphylactic shock 30 times in 12 months in 2013 ( she is pictured , right , in hospital )			1
but she has found a way of safely practicing her sport with the @entity24 @entity23 club , and has won many of their competitions ( left ) doctors were baffled as to what was causing her reactions , but eventually found she has a rare condition which means getting hot and sweaty can trigger an allergic reaction			1

miss @entity4 , who lives in @entity45 , @entity46 , said : ' i fell ill when i was 18 - years - old after 10 years of doing gymnastics			2
' i was allergic to everything and people would hug me and come away with clumps of my hair when it started falling out			2
' i would be sat in college doing my work and 10 seconds later i would n't be able to breathe - i did n't know what was triggering it			0
' miss @entity4 has diagnosed with a rare condition which affects her mast cells , which protect against disease and are involved in wound healing			1
doctors believe when she gets hot and sweaty , this causes degranulation of her mast cells , which sends her into anaphylactic shock as her body releases too many histamines			1
histamines are released when the body detects that foreign matter has entered into it			0
the histamines signal the body to send blood to the affected area , which causes swelling and inflammation			2
but for @entity78 , the histamine response is triggered by her mast cells ' abnormal response to getting hot and sweaty			1
it continues unabated , causing her body tissues to swell up , her blood vessels to become constricted and the tubes in her lungs to become inflamed and constricted , causing her to have difficulty breathing			0
' i had never heard of disabled gymnastics and wanted to keep on doing the sport so i sent in an application			0
