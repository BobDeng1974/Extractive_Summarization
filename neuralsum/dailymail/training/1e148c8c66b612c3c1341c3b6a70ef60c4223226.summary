@entity0 said that @entity25 network executives told him ‘ at the beginning of the year ’ that changes needed to be made to the show , which averaged 12.6 million viewers by the end of its first season			1
‘ it was fairly straight what they wanted , ’ he said			2
‘ we were told it had to happen straight away			2
’ @entity0 said that @entity21 , 49 , was ‘ fine ’ and ‘ gracious ’ when she heard the news			1
explanation : @entity0 told @entity14 why @entity3 had to change after its debut season last one standing : @entity41 is the only judge - apart from @entity0 - to be kept on from the first series he said of his former @entity5 colleague : ‘ she was fine			1
i called her that night			2
‘ she was very gracious and i said that to her			2
she understands it ’s business			2
’ he went on to say : ‘ i would have liked to have kept her			2
‘ @entity0 also opened up about @entity2			1
speaking of the 33 - year - old former @entity48 , he said ‘ i do n’t think she ’s mad			0
i think she ’s disappointed			0
’ @entity0 did n’t address the removal of @entity51 , who was brought over from the @entity53 to host the @entity10 version of the show			1
but he did explain the decision to keep @entity41 , the only judge , other than himself , from the original team			2
he said : ‘ there ’s not a record executive out there who is as good as him			0
’ former colleagues : @entity0 said that @entity2 was ' disappointed ' but not ' mad ' at being let go grilling : @entity0 sat down with ex-girlfriend @entity11 for the candid interview with @entity14 @entity0 refused to be drawn into which personalities have been approached to join the judging panel			1
he did , however , take the time to dispel rumours that he has offered @entity69 $ 100 million to be on the next series			1
@entity0 vehemently denied the claims , saying : ‘ no. i have no idea where this rumour came from			1
‘ i read it online that i 'd offered her $ 100 million a year			1
‘ the budget of the show is $ 100 million			1
no one is going to pay $ 100 million a year for someone			1
no. it would never ever , ever , happen			0
‘ and i genuinely have n’t had a conversation with her about it			0
no. ‘ @entity0 also slapped down rumours he has made an offer to @entity92 , who gave birth to twins last year			1
‘ she 's not on the list because i do n't think @entity92 would make that commitment , ’ he said			0
the original team : @entity0 poses with @entity3 judges and @entity51 who appeared in the first series after @entity101 had been let go ‘ she 's just had kids … you have to work five days a week on this show and you 've got to do all this travelling as well			1
‘ so , just to put it out there , she will not be on the list			0
‘ i would love her [ to do it ] , but you ca n't expect someone who 's just had two kids , who 's got a record career , to make the kind of commitment you would need on this show			0
’ @entity0 remained tight - lipped about who he has considered for the two judging vacancies			1
but when asked about other possible celebrities he was quick to give his opinion			0
he said @entity119 was ‘ absolutely not ’ being considered			0
‘ he would n't do it and he would be really difficult to work with , ’ @entity0 said of the @entity121 singer			1
he said @entity123 would be ‘ great			0
’ not bothered : @entity0 seems unperturbed by rival talent show @entity124 , which boasts celebrity judges like @entity126 and @entity127 no mention : @entity0 did n't discuss fellow @entity129 @entity51 , pictured with @entity2 , who was also let go from the show ‘ in terms of experience and success i think she would be brilliant , ’ he told @entity131 before saying that she would also be ‘ lippy ’ and ‘ expensive			1
’ @entity0 also said that @entity137 would be ‘ fun ’ and ‘ hard ’ but ‘ feisty ’ at the same time			1
the @entity3 creator was adamant that he is not looking for celebrity judges			0
@entity5 boasts singers @entity141 and @entity143 on their judging panel , while @entity124 has pop stars like @entity126 and @entity127			2
@entity0 said : ‘ i ’m not playing this game where we have to compete on the level of @entity150 stars			2
‘ once you go down that route , you ’re headed for big trouble … because you can lose focus on what the show is all about and at the end of the day the most important thing is the contestants and i want to put all my resources into finding stars from the show			0
’ he also said : ‘ the show has to evolve			0
we have some thoughts and you ’re going to find out in the next few weeks			0
’ before @entity3 premiered in the @entity10 last year @entity0 predicted it was going to be a huge ratings winner that would rival @entity5			1
while he wo n’t say the first season was a failure , he admits that he was overconfident			0
‘ most things did work , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's only because i opened my big mouth and said we were going to get 20million [ viewers ]			0
‘ if i had n't said that , everybody would be saying the show , as a new show , was a huge success			0
’ on sunday night the second series of @entity124 debuted with a massive 37.6 million viewers			2
the show , which has been a hit with the @entity184 audience , focuses on four celebrity singers , mentoring competitors on the basis of their vocal ability rather than their appearance			0
@entity0 does n’t believe this is a unique approach but rather something that he pioneered through @entity3 , which first aired in the @entity53 in 2004			2
‘ everyone thinks @entity124 started this whole mentoring thing , but it ’s complete nonsense , ’ he said			0
‘ our show was on years before them and we were always different from other shows because our judges were mentors and then they come out with @entity124 in @entity10 and they have mentors			0
‘ but that was copied from us			0

former @entity5 judge was ' fine ' and ' gracious ' when told she was fired
@entity25 executives told @entity0 in *january* changes needed to be made
he did not offer @entity69 $ 100 million to become a judge
