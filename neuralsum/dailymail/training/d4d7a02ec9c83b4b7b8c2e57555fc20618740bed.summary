by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:16 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 9 july 2013 crackdown : labour leader @entity2 said it was time to limit outside earnings for mps who earn hundreds of thousands of pounds mps should be banned from earning hundreds of thousands of pounds in lucrative second jobs , @entity2 said today			1
the @entity9 leader said there should be a limit on the amounts politicians can earn from outside interests but faced claims he was using the issue to deflect attention from his failure to stand up to his union paymasters			2
mr @entity2 sought to get back on the front foot after dire headlines over union dominance of the @entity9 , using financial muscle to influence policy and candidate selection			1
the row erupted over claims of criminal activity in the @entity9 safe seat of @entity31 , amid allegations that people were signed up as party members by @entity35 without their knowledge in order to secure the union ’s preferred candidate in the seat			1
in a speech in central @entity42 today , mr @entity2 sought to reclaim the initiative by condemning @entity35 ’s activities in @entity31 as ‘ a symbol of what is wrong with politics ’			1
he said : ‘ that was a politics closed , a politics of the machine , a politics hated – and rightly so			0
’ in a much - hyped speech he said he would reform the system of affiliating union members to @entity9 , introduce a code of conduct for would - be election candidates and introduce open primary elections for @entity9 's next candidate for @entity42 mayor			1
but despite being heralded as the biggest challenge to the unions ’ ties to @entity9 , the plans were warmly welcomed by the heads of some of @entity9 ; s biggest trade union donors			2
it also emerged that the man chosen to lead reforms of party rules is @entity73 , a former @entity74 assistant general secretary who helped steer the union into a merger with @entity77 to create @entity35 – the union accused of exerting excessive influence over @entity9			2
in a surprise move mr @entity2 announced it was time to end mps earning big money outside @entity83 in as lawyers or advising the corporate world			1
he said it was wrong that sometimes mps earn higher salaries from second jobs than as a member of parliament			0
picking a fight : mr @entity2 said he wanted to change @entity9 's relationship with the unions fightback : the @entity9 leader used the speech at the @entity97 near @entity98 to counter claims his party is in hoc to his union paymasters some 295 of the 650 mps declared some form of income , and 20 made more money outside @entity83 than their mp 's salary of £ 65,738			1
the total declared by conservative mps came to £ 4.3 million and by @entity103 £ 2.4 million			0
the mps to declare the most income included : @entity114 ( @entity115 ) £ 1.37million @entity116 ( @entity117 ) £ 740,000 @entity118 ( @entity117 ) £ 417,000 @entity119 ( @entity117 ) £ 305,000 sir @entity120 ( @entity117 ) £ 276,000 @entity121 ( @entity115 ) £ 263,000 @entity122 ( @entity117 ) £ 238,000 @entity123 ( @entity115 ) £ 183,000			0
latest figures show mps earned £ 7million from outside jobs last year , including 20 who received more than the @entity103 ' standard salary of £ 65,738			0
embarrassingly for mr @entity2 , one of the most in demand was former @entity9 prime minister @entity114 , who declared earnings of £ 1.4million , although he insists he does not receive the income himself but ‘ all the money goes directly to charity or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife ’ @entity136			1
mr @entity2 said : ' the @entity138 people expect their mps to be representing them and the country not anyone else			1
' they understand that @entity142 need to keep connected to the world beyond @entity144 and will always write articles and give speeches			0
' but can it be right that the rules allow mps to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal practice while they are supposed to be an mp ? or from outside corporations without any real form of regulation ? ' we will change things in the next @entity83			0
that is why i believe that at the very least there should be new limits on outside earnings , like they have in other countries			0
and new rules on conflict of interests too			0
' he urged @entity168 and @entity169 to work with him to tackle the problem			0
but in the @entity171 mr @entity169 rejected the idea as an attempt to distract attention from @entity9 's woes over union influence			2
the deputy prime minister said : ' i think that what is important is that it is done in the most transparent and accountable way possible			0
' people do expect mps to work for their constituents			0
that is what we are here for and that should remain the principle purpose of all mps elected to this place			0
' in what is billed as the most significant reform of his party for a generation , mr @entity2 said union members will have to ‘ opt in ’ to hand over an annual £ 3 donation to @entity9 , which they currently pay automatically			1
it has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of money @entity9 receives via union membership , but would increase the number of fully paid - up @entity9 members			2
mr @entity2 is desperate to regain credibility while police probe claims that members of the unite union conspired to fix a @entity9 candidate selection in @entity31			1
mixed messages : last night @entity35 leader @entity213 denounced the ' opt - in ' plans as ' unworkable ' but today said he welcomed mr @entity216 ; s reforms in his speech , he called for a ‘ new direction ’ with the unions , even though aides conceded this may ‘ take years ’ to achieve			1
unite leader @entity213 last night denounced the ‘ opt - in ’ plan as ‘ unworkable ’			1
but today the head of the union which has given £ 8.4million to @entity9 since mr @entity2 ’s election in 2010			1
but today mr @entity213 said he was ‘ very comfortable ’ with mr @entity2 's proposals , which he said could result in tens of thousands more union members joining @entity9			1
@entity117 chairman @entity228 said : ‘ nothing has changed			0
under @entity2 ’s proposals , @entity213 would still bankroll the @entity9 , pick @entity9 ’s candidates , and still elect @entity9 ’s leader			1
backing : former prime minister @entity233 said he supported the plans to curb the influence of the unions ‘ it ’s still the same old @entity9 : a weak leader in the pocket of the union bosses who ’s unable to stand up for hardworking people			1
’ at present , three million workers , including shop staff , nurses and train drivers , automatically have the cash taken from their union subscriptions , because their unions are ‘ affiliated ’ to @entity9			1
but the levy has long been the source of resentment for some rank - and - file members , many of whom want to belong to a union but may not support @entity9			2
under mr @entity2 ’s plan , members would have to ‘ opt in ’ to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ‘ opt out ’			1
the plans received the support of former @entity9 prime minister @entity233 , who admitted that he should have made the same reforms himself when he was leader from 1994 - 2007			2
' i think this is a defining moment , and i think it 's bold and it 's strong			0
it 's real leadership , ' mr @entity233 told @entity270			0
' i think it 's important not only in its own terms , because he 's carrying through a process for reform in the @entity9 that 's long overdue			0
' and , frankly , probably i should have done it when i was leader - but at the same time , what he is doing - and i think this is also very important for the country - is that he 's sending a very strong message to the country that in the end he 'll do what 's right for all the country and not simply for one section of it			0
' this is big stuff and it takes a real act of leadership to do it			0
' however it is unclear whether the plans would succeed in diluting union influence over @entity9 policy and elections			2
mr @entity2 is also resisting calls to change rules on electing a @entity9 leader – a process in which union members still have huge influence – or whether he will dilute their voting power at party conference , where the unions still enjoy a 50 per cent block vote			1
under mr @entity2 's plan , members would have to ' opt in ' to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ' opt out ' it remains unclear how the opt - in plans can work without union cooperation because its officials would have to administer it			1
but the move was hailed by @entity2 allies last night as the most significant reform to @entity9 since the party moved to one member one vote 20 years ago			2
but the plans are some way short of challenging @entity9 ’s links to the unions			0
if , as expected , the number of union members formally affiliated to the party via the levy drops dramatically , union bosses could actually enjoy more power over @entity9 unless the leadership and conference voting rules are changed			2
if the unions keep their block vote they would be able to manipulate the party by influencing just a few thousand union members			0
in a fresh blow , the @entity339 yesterday asked @entity341 to launch an investigation into @entity35 activities in two other seats , @entity345 and @entity346			0
the full extent of @entity35 ’s influence over @entity9 was laid bare last night when a leaked document written by the union ’s political secretary revealed that the union has privately boasted of changing @entity9 policies and dictated the subject of parliamentary debates .			2

limits should be imposed on mps earning hundreds of thousands
he also wants union members to ‘ opt in ’ to hand over an annual £ 3 donation to labour which they currently pay automatically
mr @entity2 wants to regain credibility after claims that members of the unite union conspired to fix a @entity9 candidate selection in @entity31
the plans have been met with *criticism* by @entity35 leader @entity213
