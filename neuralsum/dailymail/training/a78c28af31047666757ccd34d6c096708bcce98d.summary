by @entity0 created : 02:03 est , 24 june 2014 football fan : @entity2 , headteacher at @entity3 , has taken two weeks off working during term time to travel to @entity5 parents have attacked a primary school head teacher they say has taken two weeks off during term time to travel to the @entity8 in @entity5			1
@entity2 , 55 , was allowed to take unpaid leave from @entity3 in @entity10 due to ' personal reasons ' after enlisting the help of his union			1
the school has not confirmed the reason for mr @entity2 's absence but parents said they found out he had gone to @entity19 for the @entity8			1
a spokesman for the school said mr @entity2 has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been ' exemplary			1
' but furious parents said he should be ' setting an example ' , especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school			1
one even called on the head teacher to resign			0
businesswoman @entity32 , 42 , whose two sons attend @entity3 , said : ' i think it 's absolutely appalling			1
' he is headteacher , he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union i hear			1
' he has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them			0
' he is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents , who themselves can not go to this kind of event			2
he ought to resign because of this			0
' @entity49 added : ' i do n't think it is right			0
we parents ca n't do it , can we , but he can go away when he wants			2
i think @entity56 should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now			2
' i want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be ok			0
' anger : @entity2 was allowed to take two weeks off from @entity3 in @entity10 parents : @entity32 ( left ) said the head should resign while @entity69 ( right ) said it was a ' disgrace ' @entity69 , 41 , whose has a son at the school , added : ' we only found out he was gone recently			1
i do n't think that 's right			2
' i could n't believe what i was hearing ... it is a big disgrace and we should have been asked about this before he was allowed to go away			0
' @entity49 said : ' his leadership should be in serious question ' father - of - two @entity84 , 44 , said : ' considering parents face fines for taking their children out of school this just reeks of double standards			1
it does n't send the right message at all			0
' and @entity94 , 28 , whose two sons @entity96 , six , and @entity97 , eight , go to the school , said : ' they have n't told us anything really , it 's a disgrace			1
' but of course it has come out that he 's gone to @entity5 for the @entity8			1
if i were to take my son out of school i 'm sure i 'd be punished			0
' when my son had tonsillitis he was off for two weeks and mr @entity2 wrote us a letter saying he had had too long off sick			1
if that 's too long when you 're genuinely ill then going on a jolly to @entity5 is n't right			1
' other parents were more supportive of the headmaster			0
@entity115 , 31 , a full time mum with two children at the school , said : ' i do n't see a problem with it			1
he is taking unpaid leave and it will not affect the children as he does n't teach in class			0
' i think people are just jealous that he can go and they ca n't , he 's an exceptional head and should be allowed a one off experience			1
' @entity126 , 29 , whose daughter attends the school , added : ' i think it is fine what he has done			0
he is not hurting the children - there is plenty of cover for him for just two weeks			0
' but the @entity136 mp for @entity137 , @entity138 , said : ' it is unprofessional and disappointing that the headteacher has not displayed professional leadership at this school			1
' ' double standards ' : one parent said the school ( pictured ) had criticised her when her son was off sick mr @entity2 's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another @entity10 school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married			1
the decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union			2
a school spokesman told @entity158 : ' requests for leave of absence for personal reasons can be made by staff in line with our school policy			1
' our leave of absence policy states that the @entity170 “ will endeavour to facilitate requests for leave ” and “ will wherever possible seek to achieve for our employees a balance between home , work and leisure as part of our commitment to being an employer of choice ”			0
' our headteacher has led the school with distinction for the past ten years			2
during that time the school has improved from being judged by @entity56 as having serious weaknesses to our most recent inspection earlier this year which showed that all aspects were at least good			2
the headteacher is understood to have taken time off school to travel to @entity5 for the @entity8 ( file picture ) a spokesman for the school ( pictured ) , in @entity10 , said mr @entity2 has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been ' exemplary ' ' his attendance record over this period has been exemplary and he has never previously made a request for leave of absence			1
' the request was for unpaid leave of absence for personal reasons which has been approved by the @entity204 body after careful consideration			1
' we have made provision to ensure that during the period of this absence strong cover for leadership of the school is in place and standards of teaching and learning will remain high			1
' defending her son 's decision , the headteacher 's mother @entity216 , 77 , who lives in @entity218 , said : ' my son has put so much into education			1
surely he deserves a break			0
' why should n't he go to @entity5 , who knows what he will be able to teach the children when he returns			2
' no one would make a fuss if he took time off to cut the lawn in his garden			0
' supportive : @entity234 and @entity115 said there were plenty of staff to cover for the head teacher his mother - in - law @entity239 , 90 , from @entity240 , @entity241 , said : ' i knew he was planning but i do n't know what 's just happened			0
i know he was thinking , hoping to go			0

last week it was reported headteacher and football fan @entity257 quit his job to travel to the @entity8 because he would not miss ' the trip of a lifetime ' a @entity264 spokesman said : ' mr @entity2 applied for an unpaid leave of absence and was granted the time off by his governing body after many years of distinguished service			1
' we represented our member during the appeal as we would all members on personnel issues			0
ultimately , the decision belongs to the governing body , which appears to have acted in line with its own policies and at no cost to the public purse			0
' @entity280 , a governor at the school , said : ' i would love to be able to comment but all the board of governors were told not to say anything about it			0

' @entity3 was built in 1966 and is situated in @entity297 , five miles to the west of the city centre			2
changes to the law in september last year meant headteachers would only grant pupils leave of absence during term time in ' exceptional circumstances '			2
it is then upto the headteacher to decide how many days a pupil is allowed to be away from school if the leave is granted			1

@entity348 was furious her nine - year - old son 's primary school refused her request for him to take time off lessons to watch her marry her police officer fiance @entity353			1
