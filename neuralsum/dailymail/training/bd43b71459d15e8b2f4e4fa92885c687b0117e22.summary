a working plastic gun has been printed using a self - assembled 3d printer , a nail and some household screws			1
the gun , based on blueprints made available online by @entity7 last month , cost just $ 25 ( £ 16 ) to make and has already successfully fired nine .38 caliber shots by the @entity10 engineer who built it			1
up until now , the blueprints for the ' liberator ' gun have been mainly printed using industrial - grade 3d printers that cost around £ 5,250 ( $ 8,000 )			1
in a video posted to @entity23 , the engineer known only as @entity25 , successfully shoots nine .38 caliber shots			1
it is one of the first models to be printed on cheap , at - home 3d printers 3d printing is poised to revolutionise engineering and reforge industries from medicine , to construction to aerospace			1
the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			2
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			2
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			2
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			0
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal @entity1 , which are increasingly small , powerful and affordable			0
@entity7 used a higher - end $ 8,000 ( £ 5,250 ) model to build its 3d gun			1
however entry - level desktop models can cost $ 500 to $ 1,000 ( £ 329 to £ 659 )			1
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
researchers recently used 3d printing to print bionic ears , that contained living cells from pigs			2
this latest gun is one of the first to be @entity19 printed using the much cheaper @entity75 - 101 3d printer - a printer that can be bought online , assembled at home and costs £ 1,136 ( $ 1,725 )			1
because of the use of the @entity75 , the engineer behind the cheap gun known only as @entity25 , has called it the @entity83			1
in a video posted to @entity23 , @entity25 is shown firing the printed gun which was pre-loaded with .380 caliber rounds			1
eight shots were fired using the original printed plastic barrel			1
the barrel was then damaged , so it was replaced and @entity25 used it to fire one more shot			0
@entity25 told @entity91 he believed it could have shot even more			0
the video was filmed by fellow @entity10 engineer @entity93			1
the @entity83 is slightly different from the original plans because it has a rifled barrel and uses screws to hold it together , rather than printed plastic pins			2
it took two days to print the gun and @entity25 used generic abs materials and household items that cost a total of $ 25 ( £ 16 )			1
the blueprints for the first - ever plastic gun produced on a 3d printer were released online , for free , by @entity7 ( @entity107 ) in march			1
the company 's founder , 25 - year - old @entity108 , spent a year working on the plans before successfully testing the designs			1
the first models based on @entity7 's designs were printed in april			0
the plans behind the @entity19 - printed gun were designed by 25 - year - old @entity108 , founder of @entity7			1
@entity108 , pictured , spent a year working on the plans			0
he then made them available online , before the @entity119 @entity118 ordered him to remove them because the guns could violate export regulations this picture shows the printed parts of the liberator gun designed by @entity108 of @entity7			2
the version printed using the @entity75 printer used metal screws to hold it together , rather than the plastic pins shown in this image earlier this month , @entity7 announced the plans had been downloaded over 100,000 times and this led to the @entity119 ordering the website to take down the plans , on the basis they could violate export regulations			1
because the original gun is made entirely from plastic it makes it possible to carry the gun through airport security metal detectors , for example , without being found out			1
earlier this month , the @entity147 tested this theory by smuggling a version of the @entity83 gun onto a @entity152 train			2
two reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport - style security to carry the gun on to a @entity157 to @entity159 service in the weekend rush - hour , alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers			1
the pistol was produced in under 36 hours using a £ 1,700 machine , bought online , to ‘ print ’ its components			1
reporter @entity166 carried the plastic gun on to a @entity157 to @entity159 service in the weekend rush - hour once on board the packed 5.31pm @entity152 train , the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm , and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers the train operator began an urgent investigation into the security breach following the expose , as experts called for airports and public buildings to review their procedures in light of our revelations			1
the @entity147 pieced together the 16 - part @entity186 after downloading the designs			1
an @entity189 university student has proved earlier the same week that the designs worked , by successfully firing a bullet on a shooting range			1
to test the procedures at @entity193 , the gun produced by the @entity195 was split into three pieces and concealed in the clothing of two reporters who bought standard class tickets to @entity159			2
the reporters then walked through the usual security procedures , manned by @entity203 @entity202 officials			0
they placed their luggage and metal objects , including loose change and watches , in plastic trays which were then passed through airport scanners			2
but although they were carrying parts of a potentially deadly weapon , they were able to walk through a metal detector without triggering the alarm			0
while some passengers were patted down by security guards , they said they proceeded unchallenged to passport control , manned by @entity221 police			0
once on board the packed 5.31pm @entity152 train on friday , the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm in just 30 seconds , and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers			2
the two reporters said they did not attempt to smuggle the firing pin or bullet for safety and legal reasons , but claimed small metal items could be easily concealed			2
following the expose , security experts and politicians said they were horrified at the implications of the investigation			0
lord @entity238 , the former @entity239 security minister , called for a review to see how the ‘ extremely dangerous ’ weapons could be better detected			0
but he said he was ‘ not surprised ’ that @entity152 checks had failed to spot the weapon because they were so hard to detect			0
he said : ‘ what we need is a review of how we can look at these things and how we can discover them more easily			0
that will take work and it will cost money			0
‘ these weapons are extremely dangerous because they are very difficult to detect with the methods we normally use			0
this is going to be a real problem , no doubt about it			0
people are going to have to rethink whether we need more checks			0
’ a @entity152 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity152 has a high level of security , with a number of checks as specified by the authorities in order to protect the integrity of the @entity270			0
we take any issue relating to security very seriously			0
we will be investigating immediately to fully understand the nature of this issue with our security partner which carries out checks on our behalf at @entity193			0
we will also investigate the matter with the @entity278 , who oversee our security operation , and specify the checks that need to be undertaken			0
’ the @entity282 said the @entity203 had ‘ one of the strictest transport security regimes in the world ’ and added : ‘ this is kept under constant review in response to new or emerging threats , but we do not comment on specifics for obvious reasons			0
’ @entity108 , a 25 - year - old law student at the @entity291 spent the last year designing the weapon			2
a self - styled libertarian , he argues that everyone should have access to guns , and said last week : ‘ i recognise the tool might be used to harm other people ... it ’s a gun			1
but i do n’t think that ’s a reason not to do it			0
