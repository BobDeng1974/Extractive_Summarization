while being white , blonde and an attractive @entity2 should n't ensue judgement , according to @entity4 , @entity5 news reporter , it does come with a barrage of unfair perceptions			1
in an article by the @entity9 written on monday , @entity10 , the @entity11 and current affairs director of @entity5 , was reported to be taking a more ' commercial ' approach to the network by hiring ' good - looking , female , @entity17 ' journalists			1
while @entity10 denies he is hiring based on these standards , many of the journalists hired since his appointment in 2013 have fit the above bill			2
' never mind the fact that i work damned hard ' : @entity5 reporter @entity4 has launched a scathing attack on an article in the @entity9 that suggested she and other journalists were hired for being young , white and female @entity4 , @entity5 news reporter who was hired by @entity10 , has now hit back at claims she was hired for her beauty over her brains in an open letter to critics			1
' when a compliment suggesting i might be , in some way “ attractive , " i ’ll take it , with delight , ' she wrote in an open letter circulated to several news outlets			0
' what i wo n’t take is a suggestion that because i 'm “ attractive ” , white and a woman it somehow detracts from the credibility and substance of the news service i work for			0
' @entity46 also wrote that despite a near decade of experience , hard work , established contacts and a regular six day week gig working as a journalism teacher at @entity54 on the side , none of this was taken into account			2
diversity : the @entity5 was criticised for hiring young attractive reporters , with @entity59 one of the journalists mentioned in the article ' in my case it did n't mention the near decade of experience i could bring to the newsroom after enjoying a long career across radio and tv at the @entity69 , @entity70 and ten			2
never mind the fact that i work damned hard			0
' the article also commented on the @entity5 content taking a more ' fluffy ' lifestyle approach , which @entity46 shot back at by insisting a need for an inclusion of the arts and a more balanced approach to hard news			2
beyond the affront on her looks , credibility and the content , @entity46 made sure to clear up one thing - she was hired for passion , not because she ' scrubs up alright			0
' @entity89 is another of the @entity5 journalists whose position were questioned by the @entity9 finishing her letter with a fiery response for the @entity9 journalist behind the controversial article , @entity46 said : ' if he ’d watched the bulletin a bit closer he would have seen i ’ve changed my name to @entity4 ( too )			1
i got married late last year			0
and yes , on my wedding day , i looked the most “ attractive ” i 've ever been			0
' while @entity46 stands by @entity10 and claims that suggest the over importance her looks play , this article comes at the same week @entity105 , @entity5 political correspondent announced her departure from the network			1
it 's believed by insiders she did n't have the right ' profile ' to fit @entity10 's new criterion			1
whether it 's sexism based on attractiveness or unattractiveness , age or cultural background it could be said the head of network 's values to be ' independent from external pressures to conform or favour ' and ' provide a real multi cultural and contemporary @entity9 ' are coming under question .			0

@entity4 spoke out against claims of being hired for looks alone
the @entity9 claimed @entity10 only employed pretty , @entity130 - @entity17 girls
the article claims @entity5 is having an ' attractive ' overhaul to boost ratings
it 's believed @entity137 political reporter 's departure comes after she did n't ' fit the bill '
@entity46 said article did not take into account decade of working ' damn hard '
told @entity145 that reaction to her letter has been *supportive*
