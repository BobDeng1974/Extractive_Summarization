by @entity0 and @entity1 caffeine consumption in drinks such as cola and coffee plus energy drinks could slow down brain development in teenagers , @entity3 scientists said caffeine - laden fizzy drinks could be stopping children ’s brains from developing properly , scientists have warned			1
they believe that by preventing deep sleep , caffeine interferes with the development of the brain during adolescence			1
this is a critical time for the brain , when problems in development can lead to schizophrenia , anxiety , drug use and personality disorders			0
researchers experimented on rats , but say the findings raise concerns for children and teenagers , some of whom consume large amounts of caffeine from colas and energy drinks			1
between 300 and 400mg of caffeine – four cans of energy drink a day or three or four mugs of coffee – could make a difference , the study suggests			1
a can of the popular energy drink @entity49 , for example , contains 80mg			1
the @entity3 research focused on the development of the brain during the teenage years			1
as it prepares for the demands of adulthood , synapses , or connections between cells , that are not needed are eliminated			0
it is thought that sleep is crucial to this process			2
professor @entity64 , of the @entity65 in @entity66 , said : ‘ this optimisation presumably occurs during deep sleep			1
‘ key synapses extend , others are reduced ; this makes the network more efficient and more powerful			0
’ children and young adults guzzling the equivalent of three cups of coffee - three cans of energy drink or approximately a large bottle of cola - could be unconsciously reducing the amount of deep sleep they enjoy , thereby slowing their brain development prof @entity64 said that when young rats were given caffeinated drinking water , they got less deep sleep than those who drank plain water			1
their brains also had more connections in them at the end of the study – meaning the pruning back process had been disturbed , the journal @entity95 reports			2
a spokesman for the researchers said : ‘ children ’s and young adults ’ average caffeine consumption has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past 30 years and an end to this is not in sight			1
‘ the drinks industry is posting its fastest - growing sales in the segment of caffeine - laden energy drinks			2
‘ the brain goes through a delicate maturing phase in puberty , during which many mental diseases can break out			0
' and even if the rat brain differs clearly from that of humans , the many parallels in how brains develop raise the question as to whether children ’s and young adults ’ caffeine intake is really harmless or whether it might be wiser to abstain from consuming the pick - me - up			1
’ another recent study suggested sugar - laden fizzy drinks made children as young as five violent , withdrawn and distracted			0
a study by the government regulatory agency @entity123 concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect , such as anxiety or heart problems			2
here is the caffeine content of a number of popular drinks a recent study found a large cup of @entity136 coffee contains more than three quarters of a person 's ' safe ' daily dose of caffeine			1
the 16oz ' @entity142 ' coffee is said to contain nearly double the recommended limit for a pregnant woman , while a typical home - made 8oz cup of coffee is well above a 10 - year - old 's daily allowance			0
but scientists stress that such statistical averages can vary widely from person to person , with factors such as gender and genetics having an impact on tolerance levels			0
a person 's tolerance can also be affected by other drug use , with women who take the contraceptive pill breaking down caffeine slower , and smokers process the stimulant faster than non-smokers			0
a study by the government regulatory agency @entity123 concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect , such as anxiety or heart problems			2
the average allowance for a pregnant woman is 200mg , according to the @entity174 , and 75mg for a 10 - year - old			0
a 16oz @entity136 coffee has 330mg of caffeine , according to a table compiled by @entity179 but the coffee chain denied the findings , saying their @entity142 contains 140mg of caffeine			0
@entity184 's director of forensic toxicology , @entity183 , told @entity179 : ' people often do n’t understand the potential risk of these beverages			0
' @entity188 is a stimulant and , when consumed at high enough levels , can have negative effects			0
' a fatal dose of caffeine is thought to be around 10g - equivalent to around 75 8oz cups of coffee or 120 cans of red bull consumed within a few hours .			2

@entity3 scientists say teens drinking three cans of energy drink or a large bottle of cola every day could be reducing the amount of deep sleep they get
some researchers are concerned that young adults ' caffeine consumption has *soared* by over 70 per cent during the past 30 years
researchers experimenting on *pubescent* rats found the maturing processes in the *rodents* ' brains was *delayed* when they consumed caffeine
