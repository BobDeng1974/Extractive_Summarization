an obese mother who weighed nearly 21 stone has lost a third of her body weight in two years after she swapped sugary snacks for mushy peas			1
@entity5 , 34 , tipped the scales at 20st 9lbs after years of eating sausage rolls , crisps and chocolate bars			1
at her heaviest , @entity5 had a 46in waist and was so encumbered by her size that it took her several minutes to walk to her front door			1
decision : the school administrator decided to lose weight after seeing a picture of herself at an office party where she says she was the ' biggest by far ' of all her colleagues super slimmer : @entity5 shed eight stone in just two years by ditching chocolate bars to snack on mushy peas but the school administrator decided to lose weight after seeing a picture of herself looking larger than she liked with her work colleagues			1
she joined @entity33 and swapped sugary snacks and fast food for low - calorie mushy peas which she munches on twice a day			1
incredibly , in just two years she lost 8st 6lbs and dropped eight dress sizes			1
she now weighs 12st 3lbs and has slimmed from a size 28 to a size 12 and 32in waist			1
single mother of three @entity5 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' i snack on mushy peas at least twice a day			1
' if i 'm hungry when i get home then i 'll have some mushy peas before my dinner			1
' i loved mushy peas as a kid , my dad used to take me to a fish and chip shop every week and i would just have these amazing mushy peas			1
the old her : she weighed 20st 9lb on a diet of @entity58 sausage rolls , crisps and chocolate bars but now fills her plates with plenty of fresh vegetables as she was : she shifted the weight by ditching sugary treats and now she goes to @entity67 classes three times a week and goes to the gym at least once a week ' so when i started this diet i found some canned mushy peas , just little cans , and they taste just like they did when i was a kid			1
' so i snack on them when i feel hungry at home , say before tea , as vegetables are free it means i am not cheating on my diet and they fill me up			2
' i decided enough was enough one day in 2011 when i saw a photo of me with some work colleagues			2
' i was shocked , i was the biggest in the photo by a long way			2
i just thought , this ca n't go on			0
' @entity5 followed the @entity87 diet through @entity33 which encourages people to fill - up on salad , vegetables and fruit rather than chocolate and sausage rolls			1
she added : ' extra easy diet is basically where a lot of foods like potatoes and pasta are " free "			2
' so you could have a jacket potato with chicken breast but the golden rule is that a third of your plate is filled with " super free " food like salad , vegetables or fruit			0
' that really works for me because when i started i could have a large portion with a large side salad and i 've gradually cut my portions down			0
' before i could have three or four packets of crisps in the car on the way home from work			2
' it was a case of " no one 's seen me eating them so it does n't count "			0
' i 'd tried to do it before and failed because i was n't in the right frame of mind			0
' i went to the weigh - ins and said i was n't cheating but i clearly was because i did n't lose the weight			0
and @entity5 says her children are delighted with her achievement			1
' they are really proud , even with the older one who does n't say much , you can tell			0
' it nearly choked me up when my daughter gave me a hug and said she could fit her arms around me			0
' lifestyle change : @entity5 was so shocked when she saw a picture of her former 20st 9lb frame that she decided enough was enough and she would lose the extra weight @entity141 diet : she joined @entity33 and swapped sugary snacks and fast food for low - calorie mushy peas which she munches on twice a day , losing 8st 6lbs and dropping eight dress sizes ' we all want to lose weight but it 's having the will power to stick to what you need to do			1
' i 've always been the biggest person in the photo			0
' i got to the point where i just did n't like it anymore			0
i did n't want my oldest to be embarrassed that i was his mum			0
' to be honest i do n't know what happened , this time something just clicked			0
i was focused and determined			0
' i now attend @entity67 classes three times a week and go to the gym at least once a week			0
' i feel so much fitter			0
my target is 11st 9 , then i will have lost nine stone			2
' @entity33 leader @entity163 has been working in @entity44 for more than 20 years and says @entity5 is the biggest weight loser she 's had			1
she said : ' when she came before she lost a little bit of weight but it always went back on			2
this time she 's done great			0
' she 's completely stuck to the diet			2
she 's been really organised and determined and i think that 's the key			0
