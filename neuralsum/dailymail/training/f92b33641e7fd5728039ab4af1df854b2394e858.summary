by @entity0 a toddler who had the most misshapen head doctors had ever seen has undergone pioneering surgery to prevent her brain from being squashed			1
three - year - old @entity5 and her fellow @entity6 and @entity7 were all born with @entity8 , which causes the baby 's head to become misshapen			1
@entity5 had the most severe form doctors had ever seen because her skull was shaped like a cloverleaf			1
rare : @entity5 had the most severely misshapen head doctors had ever seen			1
she and her fellow @entity6 and @entity7 were all born with @entity8 , which causes the baby 's head to become misshapen			1
because of the severity of her case , @entity5 's skull was shaped like a cloverleaf she needed life - saving surgery to ensure her brain did n't become damaged			1
a team of expert cranio - facial surgeons came together to save her , and now @entity5 and her siblings are like any playful toddlers who will celebrate their fourth birthday in december			1
they are suffering no health issues or learning problems and are catching up in height with other youngsters			2
their mother @entity32 , 38 , of @entity34 , said : ' the doctors have been amazing			2
' when @entity5 was born no - one knew if she would survive			1
but thanks to their incredible talent we have a normal healthy daughter and we ca n't thank them enough			0
' @entity8 is a genetic condition that causes the plates of a baby 's skull to lock in position too early , before the brain has had chance to grow			1
genetic : the triplets , who are now three , their older brother @entity49 and parents @entity50 and @entity52			1
both mrs @entity5 and her son also suffer from milder forms of @entity8 , which causes the plates of a baby 's skull to lock in position too early , distorting the shape of their head most children born with the condition have surgery before they are 18 months old to separate the skull before it fuses			1
but @entity5 's condition was so severe the bones were already joining together , pushing her head into an odd shape at the top and sides , like a three - leaved clover			1
mrs @entity5 had no idea there was a problem until her 20 - week scan showed one of the triplets had a deformity			1
she said : ' when the doctors told me about @entity5 having a cloverleaf shaped head , i could n't picture that			1
i have never seen it before so i had no idea what to expect			0
' she and her eldest son @entity49 , eight , also have @entity8 , which mrs @entity5 inherited from her father			1
but each of them has a milder form and underwent small operations just before they were one			0
emergency : @entity5 needed surgery to open up her skull at two months old so her brain would have room to grow			1
then , three months later , a team of expert surgeons came together at to perform a delicate operation to reshape her head her husband @entity52 said : ' the shape of @entity49 's head started changing and that 's when we and the doctors realised he needed surgery			1
he was in hospital two or three days and then he was home and that was the end of it and he was completely fine			0
' that 's one of the main reasons why we had decided to have another child			0
i did n't want @entity49 to grow up without a sibling			0
' @entity120 syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes the early fusing of the bones of the skull and the abnormal development of the face			2
it occurs when some of the bones fuse too early , meaning the they can not grow normally and the face becomes misshapen			0
in babies with the condition , the bones normally fuse prior to birth			0
some are born with an abnormal head shape - a tall and narrow skull with wide - set eyes - while others develop problems later			1
other abnormalities associated with the syndrome include having a prominent lower jaw , hearing and spinal problems			0
the syndrome affects 1.6 people in every 100,000 and is caused by a genetic mutation			0
only one parent needs to be a carrier for a child to inherit the condition - a person with @entity151 syndrome has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to each of their children			2
about 97 per cent of children with the condition have normal levels of intelligence			0
the main treatment is surgery to expand and reshape the skull			2
source : @entity165 the @entity166 were overjoyed when they discovered they were expecting triplets and say they had ' no idea ' that their babies would be in danger of having a life - threatening form of @entity120			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity49 had been fine so i thought it would all be okay			2
' her husband added : ' but when @entity5 came out i knew she would be the one who would have the most problems			2
i was just absolutely astounded at the severity of it			0
' @entity5 needed emergency surgery to open up her skull at two months old , as soon as she was strong enough , so her brain would have room to grow			1
then , three months later , a team of expert surgeons came together at @entity184 in @entity34 to perform a delicate operation to reshape her head			0
world famous cranio - facial surgery dr @entity187 , from @entity189 , was brought in to help with the surgery , which took place in may 2010 and lasted eight - and - a half hours			2
neurosurgeon dr @entity193 said : ' the only way to reshape the head is to take that bone apart and put it back together in a different shape and that 's what we did			0
' mrs @entity5 , a health admin worker , said : ' i was scared , i was worried , i was sad			1
i wanted it to be over , i just wanted to see her			0
i did n't know how such a small baby could cope with being under anaesthesia for so long			0
' dr @entity193 added : ' our main worry was bleeding			0
this was a very small child and we were working over a very large blood vessel			0
after that it was exposing the brain to possible infection or damage during the surgery			2
' to their relief , everything went well and @entity5 made an incredible recovery and was out of hospital and back with her siblings in a matter of days			2
misshapen : an mri scan of @entity5 's skull soon after she was born , showing the severity of her case her cloverleaf shaped head was transformed , and with the help of smaller follow - up surgeries , she is now virtually unrecognisable from how her appearance as a newborn			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , who had a milder form of @entity120 , underwent their surgeries at seven months old and are also doing well			1
each child underwent physical and speech therapy to help them catch up with other three - year - olds because of their time spent in hospital			0
but the girls are expected to start nursery soon and will have no lasting effects			1
when the triplets are older they will be able to have plastic surgery to help make their face and eye shape more normal if necessary			1
as a child , mrs @entity5 admits she was teased by schoolmates because of her mildly protruding eyes , but she believes it made her a stronger person and better able to help her own children			2
doing well : the girls are expected to start nursery soon and will have no lasting effects			1
when they are older they will be able to have plastic surgery to help make their face and eye shape more normal if necessary her husband said : ' i 've know @entity32 since she was 14 and she has always stood up for herself and never backed down from anybody			2
mrs @entity5 added : ' children are going to be children			2
bullying is everywhere no matter who are			0
all three of the triplets will probably come across somebody who is going to bother them			0
but if they do get called names they will have me to help them			0
' when @entity49 started school he said some of the kids made fun of his eyes			0
but now he has learned about @entity8 and tells people about it			2
that has helped him stand up for himself			0
' we 're so happy they can have a normal life , " said @entity32			0
" i love those doctors for what they have done for my family			0
' the story appears in @entity292 : body bizarre at 10pm on monday december 2nd on the @entity294 .			0
