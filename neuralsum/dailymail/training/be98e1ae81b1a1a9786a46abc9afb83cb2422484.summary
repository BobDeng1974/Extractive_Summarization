published : 12:09 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 18 march 2013 researchers have unveiled the nearest thing yet to a real - life transformer - a human sized robot that can walk , climb walls and even turn into a tank to move across tough terrain			1
the @entity7 , or @entity8 , is designed to primarily move like a tank using tracks to cover tough terrain			1
however , when it needs to , it can simply stand up - and even use built in ' claws ' to climbs ladders , scale buildings and even hold a car 's steering wheel			1
the latest entrant to @entity19 's $ 2m @entity18 is a four - limbed robot with near - human strength and the dexterity to climb ladders or use tools like a chimpanzee , each extremity is equipped with a manipulator that enables it to grasp objects its developer say it can : move across tough terrain like a tank stand up to access higher objects climb walls using ' claws ' climbs ladders use claws to operate power tools open valves and control steering wheels its normal mode of locomotion will be much like that of a tank , with the tracks of all four limbs on the ground , the team says			1
this configuration would offer a particular advantage when moving over debris and rough terrain			0
but @entity8 also can move on the treads of just two limbs when needed , such as when it must use one or more limbs to open a valve , or to operate power tools			1
@entity8 will be able to perform complex , physically challenging tasks through supervised autonomy			2
a remote , human operator will make high - level commands controlling the robot ’s path and actions , while the robot ’s on - board intelligence prevents collisions , maintains stability and otherwise keeps the robot from harm			0
the robot also will be pre-programmed to execute tasks such as grasping a tool , stepping on a ladder rung or turning a steering wheel without step - by - step direction from the human controller , circumventing the lag between command and execution			1
' humans provide high - level control , while the robot provides low - level reflexes and self - protective behaviors , ' said @entity90 , @entity91 director and @entity93 leader			0
' this enables @entity8 to be highly capable without the complexity associated with a fully autonomous robot			2
the @entity97 ( @entity8 ) from @entity7 uses mounted tracks on each triple - jointed limb to move like a tank over roads as well as tracks , the @entity8 robot has triple - fingered manipulators to climb up ladders , remove debris , or even turn a steering wheel ' this type of robot has tremendous potential , ' he said			1
the robot will compete in the @entity19 ’s ( @entity19 ) @entity18 , in which robots will have human - like capabilities to respond to calamities such as the 2011 @entity116 nuclear plant disaster			0
climbing ladders and driving vehicles are among the obstacles robots will face in environments engineered for people			0
the @entity91 entry , @entity93 , is one of seven selected by @entity19 for @entity125 , in which each team will develop its own hardware and software			0
@entity8 is designed with static stability ; it wo n’t fall down even if it experiences a computer glitch or power failure			2
' when we walk or stand , our brains are actively controlling our balance all of the time , ' @entity90 said			0
' this dynamic balance makes people nimble and enables them to run			0
' when necessary , however , the operator can control @entity8 ’s individual joints , enabling it to adapt its motion to particular circumstances or extricate itself from tight spots			2
' in a pinch , it can do anything , ' @entity90 said			0
the robot can move like a tank over roads and rough ground , but can rise up onto two tracks to use the triple - fingered manipulators to climb up ladders , remove debris , or even turn a steering wheel			1

@entity7 , or @entity8 , is designed to move like a tank using tracks to cover tough terrain
if terrain is too tough , it can simply stand up - and even use built in ' claws ' to climbs ladders , scale buildings and even hold a car 's steering wheel
