the attack was as daring as it was destructive			1
in the early hours of august 27 last year , anarchists slipped through the cordon around a highly sensitive construction project : a firearms training centre for @entity6 and @entity7 police , next to their hq near @entity10			1
this is how the perpetrators boasted of what happened next when they claimed responsibility online : ‘ we used accelerant to burn the major electrical cables at five junction points throughout the complex , and doused and lighted a pallet of fittings and wires … we left it with flames licking high			1
’ the blaze was so intense it took four days to put it out			1
the firearms centre – a state - of - the - art - facility designed to serve forces across the @entity31 , with classrooms and two firing ranges – had been due to open within weeks			0
police said the cost of the damage was £ 18 million			1
the @entity38 is believed to have been behind the arson attack on @entity40 and @entity7 's new firearms training unit causing £ 18 million worth of damage			2
the blaze took four days to get under control local mp @entity45 said if this was the work of a religious extremist rather than an anarchist group it would be receiving far greater attention from the police and the media there was an extensive investigation and chief constable @entity55 promised they would catch whoever was responsible by ‘ developing the intelligence picture ’			1
to date , they have failed			0
they did make one arrest , but mr @entity55 – who is now suspended following allegations of sexual harassment – has admitted this ‘ did n’t lead to anything productive ’			0
yet the anarchist or anarchists – dubbed the ‘ @entity73 ’ , after reclusive @entity69 killer @entity68 , by a domestic extremism analyst who believes it is one person – is apparently not only laughing at the law , but has struck repeatedly , getting away with serious crimes time and again			0
for @entity76 can reveal that although the @entity10 attack was the most costly , it was just one in a series of about 50 incidents in and around @entity82 , dating back more than four years			1
some are seemingly trivial : minor fires that soon fizzled out ; graffiti daubings of businesses and paint - stripper thrown on cars			0
others , however , are far more serious – and there is evidence that they are linked			2
no other @entity93 city has been subject to anything remotely comparable			0
yet the @entity40 and @entity7 force have resisted suggestions that the many components are connected , despite an obvious common factor – the online claims of responsibility , all written in an outraged jargon that seems to reject every aspect of contemporary @entity93			0
the @entity38 claimed responsibility for the attack on the training centre , pictured , on behalf of a group opposed to culling badgers @entity6 and @entity7 police denied that yesterday 's attack which forced the evacuation of more than 460 homes in @entity82 was linked to the ongoing campaign of terror early yesterday , hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in the @entity118 area of @entity82 , while police carried out a controlled explosion on a suspicious car			1
however , police said the incident was ‘ isolated ’			2
the most recent ‘ @entity68 ’ attack – by a home - made incendiary bomb that gutted the front and lobby of @entity129 ’ court – took place ten days ago , in the small hours of may 22			1
so far , no one has been injured , but some of the attacks might easily have led to loss of life			2
one of the worst took place in may 2012 , when train signal cable wires were dug up and set on fire at two stations on @entity82 ’s network , @entity142 and @entity143			1
the attacks have hit offices , vehicles and shops , targeting businesses such as the supermarket @entity150 , the banks @entity156 and @entity157 , energy companies @entity153 and @entity154 , and private security firms @entity151 and @entity159			2
@entity161 vehicles were set on fire at a base in the @entity165 area in february , and three cars , two people carriers and a van were torched inside a @entity170 garage last year			0
the arsonist or arsonists have also destroyed cabling in television , radio , police and mobile phone transmitter masts at least four times , causing damage worth many tens of thousands of pounds			2
after an attack on a mast at @entity183 in april 2012 , 80,000 homes lost their tv signal for several days			1
calculating a total sum for the damage caused is difficult			0
but , adding the cost of the firearms to the masts , the railway and office attacks and the many vehicles damaged or destroyed , it must be more than £ 20 million			2
the @entity38 also claimed responsibility for an attack on a @entity170 in @entity10 , @entity82 on june 21 , 2013 each incident has followed a similar pattern : first the attack , then a long communique claiming responsibility , usually posted on the ‘ @entity200 ’ and international anarchist ‘ 325.nostate ’ websites			1
these have often appeared before any reports have been carried by news media			2
they usually contain crucial and accurate details not reported elsewhere and , say analysts , are therefore almost certainly the work of those responsible			2
the statements justify the target , and the methods used			0
in the case of the firearms centre , the statement said : ‘ the police and security industry specialise in making us feel powerless in our own lives , and making these attacks goes a long way to overcoming this feeling			1
’ according to the statement , this attack was mounted by a group called the ‘ @entity225 ’			2
more usually , the organisations cited are the ‘ @entity227 ’ ( @entity227 ) and the ‘ @entity228 ’ ( @entity229 )			0
the statement issued after the court firebombing said it was carried out with ‘ an @entity232 [ improvised explosive device ] ’ made of ten camping gas canisters and ‘ home - made napalm ’			1
it added : ‘ the justice system tries to pass itself off as the only protection from the very same desperation and imbalances that civilised society creates			0
its real function is and has always been to protect and sanctify property and privilege above all			0
’ all the statements end the same way – with appeals for support for anarchists jailed abroad , in countries such as @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256			0
some are supposedly @entity229 members			0
as part of his campaign of terror , the @entity38 attacked the front of @entity263 with an improvised incendiary device , causing damage to the front entrance , pictured the police have not so far admitted any of the attacks are linked – which , say some , is a grave mistake			1
a former police expert in domestic extremism , now working as a security consultant , told @entity76 on condition of anonymity : ‘ we ’ve been trying to draw @entity40 and @entity7 ’s attention to the obvious links between these attacks for more than two years			1
‘ there is clearly a pattern , yet they for a long time just did n’t seem to want to know			0
that means they ignored what should have been critical leads , such as the similarities between the online statements , and the clues they seem to contain			0
’ @entity45 , mp for @entity292 , said ‘ most people would be completely stunned ’ to discover ‘ this series of highly professional , apparently orchestrated attacks ’			1
she added : ‘ if these attacks were the work of a religious extremist , the police and the rest of the media would be all over them			1
yet this is every bit as serious , and , potentially , every bit as dangerous			0
how far does this network go ? who is collaborating with it ? ’ this newspaper spoke to two officers dealing with the attacks , det supt @entity312 and @entity313			2
he admitted for the first time that police are now pursuing connections between the statements , adding : ‘ there are similarities between some of the incidents , but as yet there is nothing conclusive			2
’ the connections might seem clear to national experts , but in @entity6 and @entity7 , he insisted , the police were ‘ keeping an open mind ’			1
ms @entity312 added : ‘ there probably are relatively few people causing significant amounts of damage , and they are being camouflaged by their communities			0
’ the striking fact about the attacks is the almost total absence of clues			2
@entity82 is covered by a dense network of cctv cameras , and yet these have provided no evidence strong enough to lead to an @entity342 attacker or attackers have never triggered an alarm , nor left fingerprints or other forensic clues			1
if they do comprise a cell or group , its membership appears to be watertight : no - one has blabbed			0
according to the ex-police security analyst , these factors suggest that all or most of the more serious attacks are the work of one person – probably not a youthful hothead but an older , reclusive person			0
the @entity38 claims responsibility for his terrorist attacks on several anarchist websites like the @entity69 @entity366 , this person seems determined not to be caught and endowed with a high degree of self - control : ‘ if you look at the pattern over the past few years , you get a little flurry of incidents , provoking a lot of police activity , and then you get a lull until the fuss dies down			1
’ last year , more than three months elapsed between the firearms centre arson and the next incident , the torching of an @entity153 van			0
after the @entity382 base attack in february , three months elapsed before the bombing of the magistrates ’ court			1
@entity68 , the analyst pointed out , was only caught – having already killed three people – when his brother recognized linguistic quirks in his public claims of responsibility : ‘ it may well take something similar to identify this guy			0
’ an @entity40 and @entity7 police spokesman said anyone with information should call the police on 101 or @entity400 on 0800 555 111			0
yet even as the force investigated the court bombing , he insisted that the online claim of responsibility and echoes of earlier attacks were merely ‘ one line of inquiry ’			1
ms @entity45 said the time had come for a radical rethink : ‘ the police need to admit the attacks are probably connected and be much more vocal in their appeals for help			1
if this is a trend , we need to stamp it out			0

@entity82 bomber uses @entity200 website to boast about his latest attacks
it took *firefighter* four days to *extinguish* the flames at the police gun range
@entity6 magistrates ' court was firebombed ten days ago in linked attack
local mp @entity45 said if religious extremists were responsible it would receive far greater attention from the media and the police
