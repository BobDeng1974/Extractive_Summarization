by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 20:04 est , 26 october 2012 from staying slim to the quest for perfect skin ; a woman 's list of beauty concerns is endless			0
but for ladies in @entity8 - who typically have little body hair - remaining fuzz - free was not top of their list of priorities			1
that is until a canny marketing campaign from the manufacturers of a hair removal cream successfully fostered a fuzz phobia among the country 's women - and sent its @entity20 sales soaring as a result			1
@entity23 customer : sales of the hair - removal cream are on the rise in @entity8 thanks to a marketing campaign encouraging women to aspire to being fuzz - free when @entity31 hair - removal cream first hit the shelves in @entity8 in 2005 , sales were sluggish among local women blessed with relatively hair - free skin			1
so the manufacturers launched a new marketing campaign aimed at city women linking smooth , fuzz - free skin to health , confidence , and ' shining glory '			1
as a result , many well - groomed women in @entity8 are now as preoccupied by stray hairs as their western counterparts			2
fuzz phobia : @entity31 is now its manufacturer 's fastest growing @entity8 brand @entity20 sales of hair remover are rising by 20 per cent annually - almost double the rate of women 's razors - according to research carried out by @entity54			1
and @entity31 is now the fastest - growing brand in @entity8 for @entity57 manufacturers @entity56			0
@entity59 , the firm 's @entity8 chief , told @entity61 : ' it 's not how much hair you have , it 's how much you think you have			0
' if your concern level is high enough , even one hair is too much			0
' the campaign is certainly not the first time a manufacturer has played on women 's preoccupation with perceived flaws			0
beauty giants @entity73 and @entity75 both sell skin - whitening creams in @entity8 , where many women perceive lighter skin as preferable			2
mr @entity59 said the firm 's role was not to remind @entity8 women how much hair they have , and insisted its customers were too ' independent - minded ' to be persuaded to buy a product they did n't really need			2
more women in @entity8 are now as preoccupied by body hair as their western counterparts but @entity88 , a social psychologist and assistant professor of marketing at @entity91 , likened @entity31 's @entity8 marketing to ' the apple in the @entity94 '			2
' it creates an awareness , which subsequently creates a feeling of shame and need , ' he told @entity61			0
pr consultant @entity100 , 29 , said she had been using @entity31 since receiving a free sample in the summer , and added that the product 's marketing ' makes @entity8 women more aware of their body hair issue '			1
the manufacturers targeted flooded university campuses with free samples and enlisted glamorous actress @entity108 as a spokesmodel as part of its efforts to target female students and cosmopolitan city women			0
while @entity8 sales of the product have noticeably increased on the back of the new marketing approach , it is still not a familiar brand outside of cities and is yet to benefit from a national advertising campaign			0
but if the strategy continues to work its magic there could be plenty of room for growth , as a study showed that just 0.6 per cent of @entity8 women remove body hair .			1

a hair removal cream *embraced* a new marketing strategy linking fuzz - free skin to health and confidence
encouraging @entity8 women - who typically have little body hair - to focus on stray hairs
@entity20 sales of hair remover are rising by 20 per cent annually
