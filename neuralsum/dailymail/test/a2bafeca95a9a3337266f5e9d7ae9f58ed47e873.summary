genealogists have made an error in compiling the family tree of @entity4 and she is in fact linked to a poor @entity7 mining family , an expert claimed as she kicks off her bid to enter the @entity10 , @entity4 could claim that her path to the presidency began some 160 years ago in the little - known @entity7 parish of @entity14 – if she can pronounce it , that is			1
for while the @entity18 @entity17 has previously spoken of her @entity20 ancestry , a definitive family tree has revealed her links to a poor mining community in the @entity23			1
@entity14 , pronounced @entity24 - rady - vod - ug , was the home of mrs @entity4 's great grandmother - a woman who showed a determination , similar to that of the former first lady , to struggle through poverty and eventually emigrate to @entity18 with her family			1
in fact mrs @entity4 's steely resolve to get to the @entity10 and make history as the first female president , can be seen in the actions of her female ancestors , who even defied social conventions through the years			1
@entity18 genealogy expert @entity39 has traced mrs @entity4 ’s roots to a mining family from @entity14 , a small community in south @entity7			1
it is named after @entity44 , or @entity45 , a sixth century @entity7 saint who some believe may have been a @entity48			0
the district , known for its reliance on coal mining and poverty , has since been abolished and is now part of @entity54			2
mrs @entity4 's great - grandmother @entity55 was born in @entity56 in the @entity23 , and from an early age supported her widowed mother			1
official records show she was working as a servant by the age of 12 but in reality she may have been working even earlier			0
ms @entity39 said : ' born around 1850 in @entity56 – at that time , the largest town in @entity7 – she [ @entity55 ] can be found in the 1851 census living with her widowed mother and three older siblings			0
' fatherless by the age of one , @entity55 had already been dealt a tough hand			0
in a bid for a better life the family made the lengthy journey via @entity81 to @entity82 in @entity83 , another mining district where they would continue their trade in the early 1880s			1
shortly after they arrived @entity87 was born , sometime between 1882 and 1883			0
@entity88 continued as the head of the family , her husband mostly absent			0
@entity87 was one of just four children out of 14 born who survived - an indication of the poverty her traditional mining family lived in			1
mrs @entity4 's grandparents @entity87 ( left ) and @entity98 eloped to wed in @entity99 , @entity100 , and are pictured with their granddaughter , former first lady @entity4 it was in @entity18 that @entity87 - who was to become mrs @entity4 's grandmother - met @entity98 , part of the @entity98 family who had travelled to @entity18 two years earlier from @entity106			1
but the circumstances of their marriage reveal the poverty the @entity73 family endured and the wide social gulf between the @entity113 and @entity114 at that time			0
the pair eloped to @entity99 in @entity100 to get married - a place akin to @entity117 where people would often go to wed because regulations were less strict			0
@entity87 ' family hailed from a poor mining district which is now part of @entity54 in @entity7 mrs @entity4 's family were from @entity14 , close to @entity75 and @entity56 , and now part of @entity54 from the family histories of the @entity73 and @entity128 families , it appears the pair may have been forced to elope because the @entity113 were unlikely to have approved of their son marrying a woman from such a poor family when they had managed to become moderately wealthy after emigrating to @entity18			1
ms @entity39 revealed that the @entity73 family were all miners while the @entity113 - who were to become @entity87 ' in - laws - had left the trade after arriving in the @entity18 , and one even became a physician			2
ms @entity39 said : ' when @entity98 found himself smitten with @entity87 , he had fallen for a girl who was regarded as being from “ the wrong side of the tracks			2
” mrs @entity4 announced she was running for president last week and toured the @entity144 factory if @entity4 is successful she could make history as the first female president of the @entity18 ' if he had n’t been bold enough to wander across the state line to marry his sweetheart , @entity4 ’s father would n’t have born , erasing her from the scene			1
' and if [ @entity4 ] @entity4 recalls her grandmother @entity152 as a strong - willed woman who “ ruled everyone within her reach , ” it may have been a reflection of her determination to escape the circumstances that left her the sole survivor of her birth family of 16 by her early forties			2
' @entity162 , frequently described by mrs @entity4 as a ' strong willed woman ' gave birth to mrs @entity4 's father @entity165 in 1911 and died in 1952 when mrs @entity4 was just five			1
1850s - @entity55 born in @entity56 in @entity7 to poor family			1
1851 - miss @entity55 was living with her widowed mother and three siblings in @entity7 and by the age of 12 was working as a slave			0
1871 - miss @entity55 married @entity73 , a coal miner from @entity75 near @entity173			0
they settled in @entity14 , near @entity56			0
1880 - the @entity114 moved to @entity82			0
1882 - 1883 - @entity87 was born , one of 14 children - of which only four survived			1
1902 - @entity87 eloped to @entity99 to marry @entity178			1
he had been born in @entity106 and travelled to @entity18 with his family where he met @entity87			2
1911 - @entity165 born to the couple in @entity82 , @entity83			2
1942 - @entity165 married @entity181 , originally from @entity182			0
1947 - @entity4 , the eldest of the couple 's three children was born			2
she later went on to marry @entity185			0
1952 - @entity162 dies , when @entity4 is just five years old			0
the account appears to be the first definitive family tree for mrs @entity4 which traces her @entity7 roots to an area of the @entity190			1
previous versions appear to have been drawn incorrectly due to a mix - up over her grandmother			0
ms @entity39 claimed she discovered a key flaw in how genealogists previously compiled mrs @entity4 's family tree in misidentifying @entity87			1
she said the mistake was made after two children of the same name were born in @entity82 in @entity83 between 1882 and 1883 , and experts previously ' latched onto ' the incorrect @entity87			2
ms @entity39 discovered the error while doing research for a piece about mrs @entity204 and managed to trace the correct woman using marriage records and obituaries			0
she identified a woman born shortly after her family arrived in the @entity18 in the 1880s , @entity87 , who then went on to marry @entity98 in 1902			1
the revelations come after mrs @entity4 herself appeared to make a mistake regarding her ancestry last week when she suggested all her ancestors were immigrants			2
she was later forced to correct the error after it was proven that @entity87 was born in the @entity18 in the 1880s .			0

a definitive family tree of @entity4 reveals her @entity7 ancestors
they lived in a poor mining district called @entity14 , now @entity54
@entity224 emigrated to @entity83 where mrs @entity4 's grandmother @entity87 was born - one of four children out of 14 born to survive
@entity87 then eloped with @entity98 - mrs @entity4 's grandfather - to marry because his family probably *disproved* of her poor *background*
