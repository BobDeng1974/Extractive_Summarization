three @entity1 prisoners who managed to escape their shackles in a helicopter earlier this month have been recaptured and returned to their detention center			1
the three men had been arrested as part of a 2010 drug bust called @entity8 that netted weapons , cars and a plane			1
they were awaiting trial on charges that included murder and gangsterism when a helicopter appeared on june 7 and flew them from a courtyard at the @entity19 outside of @entity20 where they were being held under light security			1
a day before the escape a judge had eased restrictions on the men allowing them to be in the courtyard at the same time on court days after they complained harsh security conditions were impeding their defence			2
their escape set off an international manhunt , and the trio were added to an @entity36 red notice list , reserved for the world 's most wanted fugitives			2
these three men were recaptured early this morning in @entity39 two weeks after their brazen escape by helicopter from a detention center @entity44 officers arrested the trio at a @entity39 residence at about 1:30 a.m. this morning			1
@entity47 , 35 , @entity48 , 53 , and @entity49 , 49 , are scheduled to appear in court in @entity20 on monday , according to @entity51			0
police did n't divulge any more details about how they recaptured the fugitives or who was flying the helicopter , but more arrests in the case are expected			0
police found the escaped prisoners hiding in this apartment in @entity39 this morning this image shows where the escapees apparently slept inside the apartment in @entity39 the @entity66 government has ordered an investigation into the incident , which will also look into a similar escape that took place in 2013			2
in march of that year , two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a local tour company and ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near @entity39			1
there they lifted two inmates to freedom using cables			0
the fugitives in that case were also eventually recaptured			0
other memorable helicopter escapes include a @entity85 prisoner who managed to fly away twice , in 2006 and again in 2009 , and @entity87 's flight from a @entity89 jail in 1971			0
the latter incident inspired a book and a movie			0
