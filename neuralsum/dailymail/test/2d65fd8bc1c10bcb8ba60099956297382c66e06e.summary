@entity0 will be left to focus on the @entity2 season this summer after boss sheik @entity3 signed up @entity4 to ride the horses which race under his @entity8 banner in @entity9			1
the only exception will be @entity13 ’s dual @entity12 winner @entity11 , who will continue to be partnered by veteran @entity14			0
@entity4 is the only jockey to have ridden @entity16 - trained @entity15 , who was unplaced for @entity8 in last year ’s @entity12 having gone into the race one of the leading fancies having won the @entity20			2
@entity0 is to concentrate on the @entity2 flat season and not being picked to ride in @entity9 the recruitment of @entity4 could be seen as a snub for @entity0 , who was replaced by @entity14 on @entity11 in the build - up to her @entity12 success			1
but @entity26 insisted it was no longer logistically feasible to have one jockey covering both countries because @entity13 ’s operation has expanded so much			0
@entity26 said : ‘ last season it was feasible to keep travelling back and forth across the @entity33 but we have more horses this year – 80 in @entity9 and almost 100 in @entity36			1
‘ it makes more sense to have a jockey based over there			0
@entity4 is the rider signed up to race the @entity8 banner in @entity9 this summer ‘ @entity0 is happy with it and he will still ride @entity2 horses which we send to run in @entity9			1
‘ the contract has literally been signed today			0
we have a very good relationship with @entity4			2
@entity14 will still ride @entity11 - there is no point breaking up a partnership that works			0
’ @entity0 finished third on @entity8 ’s @entity50 in yesterday ’s @entity51 at @entity52			2
the @entity54 - trained colt , which had won its only previous race at @entity56 last year , showed signs of inexperience in a tactical affair won by his @entity61 - ridden , front - running stablemate @entity62			0
@entity54 , who runs both @entity63 and @entity64 in tomorrow ’s @entity65 at @entity66 , said both his @entity68 colts could run in the @entity69 but , interestingly , @entity61 hinted that either the @entity72 or @entity9 versions , both run around a bend as opposed to a straight course , might suit length and a quarter winner @entity77 best			0
sheikh @entity3 ( centre ) chose not to go with @entity0 and insists that he 's happy with his choice most significant @entity69 action possibly took place before racing started on the @entity52 when @entity83 - trained @entity84 put in a decent gallop under @entity86 , who @entity87 hopes will ride his colt in the @entity89 back here on may 2			1
retiring champion jump jockey @entity91 was unplaced on his final ride at @entity93 when @entity94 finished seventh in the handicap hurdle won by @entity96			1
@entity91 rides at @entity97 for the next two days , including the mount on @entity100 - trained @entity99 in friday 's @entity101			2
it is then likely he will not ride again until bowing out from the sport at @entity105 ’s end - of - season meeting on saturday			0
@entity91 ( right ) was unplaced at his last ride at @entity93 but rides in the @entity107			1

@entity0 to focus on the @entity2 flat racing season this summer
@entity4 chosen to ride in @entity9 by @entity111
@entity91 will ride his last @entity107 on @entity113 on friday
