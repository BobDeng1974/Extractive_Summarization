by @entity0 a paedophile suspected of abducting @entity2 has been linked with attacks on another five @entity5 girls			2
they include a ten - year - old who was sexually assaulted in @entity8 two years before three - year - old @entity9 vanished from the resort in the @entity11 , @entity5 police revealed yesterday			1
the attack took place in the ‘ heart of the resort ’ in 2005 but the victim , now thought to be 19 , did not tell her parents at the time			0
their apartments were broken into and five young girls were assaulted in their beds by a predator who police believe may be a local binman described as ‘ smelly and pot - bellied ’			0
since the appeal six other @entity5 families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period			0
five of those children – including the ten - year - old molested in @entity8 – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘ near miss ’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts			1
police have received 500 calls about the mystery man said to have ‘ a vile interest in young , white , female children ’			2
the latest development comes as police announced that they are about to begin ‘ operational activity ’ on the ground in @entity53 , raising hopes that arrests could be imminent			2
detectives are preparing to fly out to @entity53 in the next fortnight in a move which will coincide with the anniversary of @entity9 ’s disappearance			0
the investigation into the disappearance of @entity2 may have taken a step forward after @entity5 police announced they expect to start a new operation in @entity53 soon they hope to be able to arrest and quiz suspects but any formal interviews will be conducted by @entity53 police with @entity72 officers sitting in			1
after months of stalling , the @entity53 authorities are set to give the go - ahead by the end of the week on three letters of request from @entity21 which are thought to include the questioning and arrest of suspects			1
detectives hope the breakthrough will mean @entity5 and @entity53 officers can act within days			1
three incidents took place in @entity87 - between 2005 and 2010 five incidents took place in @entity90 between 2004 and 2006 nine incidents took place in the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 ( @entity97 district ) between 2004 and 2008 one incident took place in @entity100 in 2005 , a new offence which has come to light since the march appeal but they have still to agree a timescale with the @entity53 authorities which have refused to mount a joint investigation with their @entity5 counterparts , preventing @entity21 detectives from carrying out their own activities in @entity53			1
it emerged yesterday that the @entity53 have already snubbed a number of requests from @entity21 ’s @entity113 set up in 2011 to investigate the toddler ’s disappearance			0
one key thing detectives want to establish is if there are any local police files on the break - ins , now totalling 18 , of @entity5 tourists ’ apartments around the @entity11			1
astonishingly , local police knew about 14 of them at the time of @entity9 ’s disappearance , but dismissed any link as they were spread over a wide area and there were no attempts to abduct the children targeted			0
detective chief inspector @entity130 said the attack on the ten - year - old girl was particularly significant because it ‘ now takes us into ’ @entity8			1
@entity9 disappeared from her family ’s holiday apartment on may 3 , 2007 , as her parents @entity137 and @entity138 dined at a nearby restaurant			0
a computer - generated image of the distinctive burgundy long sleeve top worn by a man that detectives investigating the disappearance of @entity2 are looking for detective chief inspector @entity130 said the cases bear many similarities ordeal : @entity148 and @entity149 , who have to endure not knowing what happened to their daughter for seven years police would not reveal what the operations will involve			2
pictured , a street in @entity8 where an @entity158 holiday maker and his wife claim they saw a mystery person with a child about the same time as @entity2 disappeared in may 2007			0

detectives set to begin investigation in @entity53 following breakthroughs
officer is ' *cautiously* *optimistic* ' that police from both *nations* will act soon
@entity5 police waiting for *approval* for operation from @entity53 authorities
a 10 - year - old girl was sexually assaulted in same are as @entity178 in 2005
there are now potentially 18 linked cases , officers said
