by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 18:22 est , 18 july 2013 the widow of a church organist bludgeoned to death on his way to @entity5 said yesterday that she had no feelings of ‘ hate and unforgiveness ’ for his killers			1
in an extraordinary act of compassion , @entity11 refused to condemn @entity14 and @entity15 for their brutal and motiveless attack on her husband @entity18 , whom she described as her ‘ soul mate ’			1
instead , committed @entity20 , 63 , insisted she would be praying for the thugs and hoped that ‘ @entity23 ’s great mercy will inspire them to true repentance ’			2
distraught : mrs @entity11 ' said @entity18 was ' devoted to loving @entity23 and loving the people he came into contact with ' verdict : @entity15 , left , has been convicted of the manslaughter of @entity30 , right , who was attacked as he walked to church for midnight mass on @entity33 guilty : @entity14 , 22 , had already admitted the murder of @entity30 her inspirational words came as a jury found @entity15 guilty of the 68 - year - old ’s manslaughter , after his stepbrother @entity14 had admitted murder			1
the pair , both 22 , were out ‘ looking for trouble ’ when they set upon mr @entity20 with a wooden pickaxe handle as he walked to @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , to play the organ for @entity5 last @entity33			1
his body was found slumped against park railings with almost every bone in his face broken – similar injuries to those found in car crash victims			2
the pair ran away laughing after the random attack , leaving him for dead on the pavement with catastrophic head injuries			1
mrs @entity11 , a mother of four and grandmother , watched her husband of 40 years die in hospital three days later			1
during the trial she sat quietly through more than three weeks of evidence , but yesterday she broke down into sobs as the jury reached its verdict on @entity15 following 13 hours of deliberations			1
she said : ‘ @entity18 was a wonderful man who is so dearly missed			2
our lives will never be the same again			2
@entity18 was a man who was driven by love and compassion and he would not want any of us to hold on to feelings of hate and unforgiveness			1
so in honour of @entity18 and in honour of the @entity23 we both love my prayer is that this story does n’t end today			0
‘ my prayer is that @entity14 and @entity15 will come to understand and experience the love and kindness of the @entity23 who made him in his own image and that @entity23 ’s great mercy will inspire them to true repentance			1
’ @entity47 @entity85 heard how , after the attack , @entity15 said @entity14 grabbed his wrists and told him : ‘ that ’s me being normal – imagine me going sick			1
’ @entity15 maintained that he did not wield the pickaxe handle			1
court drama : there was confusion at @entity93 when the clerk only asked the jury foreman for the murder verdict against @entity15 vicious : following @entity15 's conviction , police have released this picture of the pick - axe handle used in @entity30 ' murder but the prosecution said that the pair were ‘ in it together ’ and deliberately chose a dimly - lit area to launch the savage attack			1
police said the killers came across their victim , a retired social worker , by chance because he had returned to his house to fetch his hat			2
@entity113 , @entity114 , prosecuting , said : ‘ their motive was not one of robbery , in short these two men were walking the streets looking for a suitable victim			0
‘ if it had n’t been mr greaves it would have been somebody else			0
they both intended to inflict really serious bodily harm to mr @entity20			0
’ the pair , both unemployed , were arrested after being identified on @entity127 footage released to the media showing them walking behind mr @entity20			0
@entity15 turned himself in to police after seeing the @entity127 footage			1
he claimed he had not come forward before because he was scared of @entity14			1
horrific : mr @entity20 was on his way to @entity132 , @entity46 , when he was attacked in the case of @entity14 , he admitted murder after his dna was discovered on a piece of wood from the murder weapon which was lodged in mr @entity20 ’s head			1
@entity14 , of @entity140 , @entity47 and @entity141 , are expected to be sentenced today			1
after the hearing @entity143 @entity142 , who led the police inquiry , praised mrs @entity11 and her family for displaying ‘ great strength and dignity in such ghastly circumstances ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity18 was a man who worked all his life			0
he was a loving father and husband and he was the local church organist and did extensive charity work			0
it could have been anybody			0
‘ he was not targeted			0
that is the unpleasant part about this particular crime			0
’ mrs @entity11 , who works for the @entity158 charity , added that her compassion for the killers had done nothing to stop the constant pain she felt			1
‘ i used to be a happy and fulfilled person who lived with my soul mate			0
suddenly i am lonely and i have no one to talk to , as we did constantly			0
‘ i put my energy into getting through the tears and the crying each day			2
i do n’t want people to think that because i can forgive , this has been an easy journey for me			0
the switch from being happily married to single has been horrific			0
’ brutal : the scene where @entity174 ' was attacked in the @entity176 area of @entity47 last @entity33 community in shock : local residents bring flowers and talk to police at the scene where mr @entity20 ' was killed by @entity0 and @entity183 he was a devout @entity184 whose kind nature endeared him to all he met			2
they were two workshy thugs who smoked cannabis and terrorised their neighbourhoods			0
the contrast between @entity30 and his killers could hardly have been more stark			2
memories : mr @entity20 ' quiet and religious life was in deep contrast to his violent and senseless death happier times : @entity11 described her husband as a ' truly beautiful man ' mr @entity20 , 68 , described by friends as a ‘ gentle soul ’ , dedicated his life to helping others – first as a social worker and then as a church organist			1
his wife @entity204 , also a social worker , said he often went ‘ beyond the call of duty ’ in looking after his clients and was involved in a host of community activities			0
before he left his home for the last time , he brought her flowers and told her : ‘ i love you so much , @entity204 , and i ’m so glad that i married you			0
’ bereft : @entity11 spoke movingly at the funeral of her husband @entity18 's funeral about how he would have advised her not to be angry with his killers meanwhile , @entity14 and @entity15 had spent the day drinking and smoking cannabis and had headed out looking for trouble			1
the stepbrothers lived near mr @entity20			0
neither had ever had a proper job and @entity14 ’s family was known to be on long - term benefits			1
@entity14 had been released from prison only in october , weeks before the killing			2
he has been jailed for a number of violent robberies and is said to have terrorised neighbours since the age of 13 , with them even petitioning the council to have him removed			0
friends say he was expelled from secondary school on his first day and spent long spells of his teenage years in juvenile detention centres			0
his mother @entity236 , 55 , who worked part - time in @entity237 , was forced to hand him over to police at least once and threw him out aged 16			0
he is said to have been given an asbo and banned from coming into the neighbourhood , but he ignored it			0
he met his sidekick at the age of 11 when his father , convicted wife - beater @entity244 , 46 , struck up a relationship with @entity15 ’s mother , @entity247			2
despite @entity15 painting himself as an innocent party in court , locals say he was banned from pubs and shops in his neighbourhood			1
@entity14 ’s estranged uncle , @entity254 , 49 , a roofer , said : ‘ he may be my flesh and blood but he deserves to be strung up for what he did to that old man			2
’ an acquaintance of the murderer added : ‘ he ’s the kind that will see a life sentence as a badge of honour			0

@entity30 , 68 , died following vicious attack in @entity46 , @entity47
@entity15 and @entity14 , both 22 , carried out the assault
@entity14 had already admitted murder at @entity93
mrs @entity11 said she would ' not hold on to feelings of hate '
@entity15 's family *celebrated* when jury returned ' not guilty ' verdict for murder
then foreman shouted through noise ' but guilty of manslaughter '
@entity15 's *girlfriend* @entity284 ran from the court screaming and in tears
