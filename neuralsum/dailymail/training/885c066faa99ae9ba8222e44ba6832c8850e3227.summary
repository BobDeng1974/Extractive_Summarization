by @entity0 urine the clear : despite being filmed urinating into his colleagues ' kettle , police say @entity5 committed no crime as he is free of disease four female nursery teachers who were suspicious about their strange - smelling tea trained a hidden camera on their thermos flasks - and discovered a cigarette - smoking colleague was urinating in them			1
@entity14 police arrested 54 - year - old @entity15 and took him to hospital where he was tested for infectious diseases			1
but they say the teacher at @entity20 , in the north eastern city of @entity22 , committed no crime because he has a clean bill of health so his actions caused no harm			1
the four women aged between 21 and 26 complained to police after saying they had discovered the reason why their tea smelt strange			2
they set up a hidden camera in one of the classrooms and saw that the kindergarten 's only male teacher had been relieving himself into their thermos flasks			1
the man reportedly felt his female colleagues did not respect him enough , and was bitter at being passed over for the job of kindergarten boss			2
but teacher @entity40 , 26 , one of the four , said she was furious that police had simply given the man nothing more than a stern lecture and a warning not to do it again			1
she said : ' i first noticed there was a strange smell from my tea a few weeks ago after i returned to the class after taking the children out to play in the playground			0
' the cups are not transparent , so it was hard to see if the liquid looked strange but there was certainly a strange smell which also came from the thermos flasks that the tea was stored in			0
' i changed the flask and bought a new one but once i brought it to the kindergarten again i had the same problem with the strange smell			0
flushed out : one of the four teachers lays the trap before her colleague wanders into the room unawares teaching a-cistern - t : watching the footage , the horrified women finally realised why their tea was smelling odd the perfect grime : the man zips up and walks away , not knowing police would soon swoop on the school ' eventually i discovered that my three colleagues had the same problem , and we thought perhaps somebody was putting something in the water			2
' the women complained to kindergarten boss @entity86 , 37 , who advised them to put a camera in the room			0
so they activated the camera on a mobile phone and put it in a basket filled with children 's toys			0
the video showed the man , who appeared to be smoking a cigarette , picking up one of the women 's brand new pink flasks and holding it close over his genitals while he contaminated her morning drink			2
all four women refused to return to work if their colleague was not sacked			0
however , the stand - off was resolved when he agreed to pay around Â £ 200 to each of the women , apologised , and promised not to do it again			0
pointing the finger : one of the teachers singles out the pink thermos flask at the scene of the non-crime police swooped on the @entity20 in the city of @entity22 , but said the male teacher had committed no crime because he has a clean bill of health so his actions caused no harm			1
