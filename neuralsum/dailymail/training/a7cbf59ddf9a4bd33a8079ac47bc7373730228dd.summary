as @entity6 stepped to within touching distance of an elusive tenth @entity8 following their 4 - 0 destruction of @entity10 at the @entity3 , two former @entity5 stars played their part			1
defender @entity12 may have embarrassed @entity6 's expensively assembled array of forwards with two superbly taken headed goals before @entity16 set a @entity8 record of 16 goals ( and counting ) this season - but @entity20 and @entity21 's contribution can not be overlooked			1
although the @entity22 may be the world 's most expensive player and went some way to attaining cult status with his winning goal in the @entity28 final , @entity21 is still regarded with more affection by the @entity6 faithful - his is one of the few names chanted at the @entity32			1
the @entity56 's perfectly whipped corner was met with a bullet header from @entity12 to ease @entity59 nerves after only 16minutes and @entity61 's side rarely looked back , despite conceding the lion 's share of possession to the @entity64			0
not to be outdone , @entity20 was instrumental in real 's third goal when he turned on the after - burners to speed through the centre of @entity10 's midfield before sliding a pass to his teammate and general object of affection @entity16 to slot home			1
@entity21 who 's talking : @entity21 corner led to @entity6 's first goal - met with a bullet header from @entity12 rear guard : defender @entity12 puts @entity6 's attackers to shame with two superbly taken headed goals after burners : @entity20 used his blistering pace to surge through midfield before passing to @entity16 to finish portugeezer ! @entity16 broke @entity84 's record by scoring 16 goals in a @entity8 season while @entity20 was largely used as a left - sided winger , before his talent took him to a more central position , at @entity40 - he was predominantly employed on the right flank against @entity10			1
this was no doubt to accommodate @entity16 's preferred method of cutting in from the opposite side , but @entity20 stuck diligently to his task and controlled the right side of the pitch while also using his energy to track back in defence			0
all right on the night : @entity20 stuck to the right flank diligently and was able to both attack and defend @entity102 : @entity21 meanwhile , @entity21 played in a deep lying playmaking position that will be familiar to most @entity35 fans			2
in a similar way that @entity106 has been dictating the play for @entity108 this season , @entity21 was able to orchestrate events without his relative lack of pace being a hindrance			0
and , as this heat map shows , he was able to station himself at the heart of @entity6 's midfield while occasionally finding space in important forward areas with his intelligent movement			0
pass masters : @entity121 's @entity10 dominated possession against @entity6 's counter-attacking side hoof it : @entity10 hot more than twice as many passes - whereas the @entity59 played more long balls in terms of general play , the newly crowned @entity8 favourites managed to complete a four - goal rout away from home despite having only 30.7 per cent of possession against a @entity10 side educated by @entity121			1
@entity10 made 656 passes , more than twice as many as @entity16 and @entity135 's 287 - and showed more accuracy than their @entity59 counterparts			2
@entity6 did hit more long passes , an obvious reflection of @entity6 's counter attacking tendencies learned under @entity141 , but while @entity10 had more total shots ( 19 compared to 13 ) and corners ( nine compared to three ) than their opponents - they still failed to register a single goal on the scoresheet			2
@entity6 's defence obviously played an important part , but the likes of @entity150 and @entity151 were wasteful too - with a shooting accuracy of only 36.4 per cent			0
shooting blanks : @entity10 led the way in terms of total shots but @entity6 's four goals are the only attacking statistics that matter			0

@entity6 beat @entity10 to reach the @entity8 final
@entity21 pulled the strings from midfield and *assisted* the first goal
@entity20 *stormed* through to set up @entity16 for the third goal
the @entity64 had 69.3 per cent possession and played more than twice as many passes
