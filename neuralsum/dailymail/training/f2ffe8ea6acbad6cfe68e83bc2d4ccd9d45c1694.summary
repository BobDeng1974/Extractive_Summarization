by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 18 february 2013 @entity2 : 14:02 est , 18 february 2013 questions are being asked as to why @entity5 's powerful missile defence radar systems did not detect the meteorite that exploded over the country on friday morning			1
almost 1,200 were injured when the untracked lump of space rock exploded over the @entity10 , with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of @entity14			1
in the aftermath of the impact @entity5 politicians called on the world 's powerful nations to urgently develop technology to spot asteroids and meteorites that threaten our planet			2
experts from the @entity45 have attempted to explain how the rock , estimated by @entity47 to have been 55ft - wide and weighing some 10,000 tons , could have slipped through the net			1
it is estimated to have exploded above the @entity51 moutains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons - nearly 25 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on @entity55 in 1945			1
the group , which offers definitive information on the state of @entity5 's nuclear arsenal and intercontinental weapons systems , published an image how far into space the country 's radar systems can penetrate			1
the @entity5 - based group claims that despite the size of the object , early warning radars ' never had a chance ' - particularly since they were never designed to detect rocks hurtling in from outer space			1
how @entity5 's missile defence systems missed it : the radar fans of the @entity5 early warning system are plotted here on @entity76 , with the suspected trajectory of the incoming meteorite shown in green @entity81 - powered lasers could protect @entity39 from any more asteroids judged to be flying too close			1
@entity84 researchers have outlined a plan for solar powered space defences which could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past @entity39 on friday night in 60 minutes			2
the same system could destroy asteroids 10 times larger in about a year , with evaporation starting at a distance as far away as the @entity81 , the researchers claim			0
after @entity39 's close shave with asteroid 2012 @entity95 on friday night - and the unexpected meteorite explosion which injured 1,200 @entity5 that morning - attention has turned to technology which could be used to defend our planet			1
academics from the @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 , @entity104 , have outlined a plan to destroy any before they can destroy us			0
they say their concept , dubbed @entity110 of @entity111 an @entity112 , or @entity113 , is ' a realistic means of mitigating potential threats posed to the @entity39 by asteroids and comets			0
' described as a ' directed energy orbital defence system ' , @entity113 is designed to harness the vast power of the @entity81 and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams			0
these can then be aimed at any threatening - looking asteroids to destroy them before they can get too close			0
as can be seen from the image , and an accompanying @entity76 file posted on the project 's website , @entity5 's radar systems ignore the @entity39 's curvature and scan fan - shaped areas extending past our planet 's atmosphere			2
assuming the meteorite followed a straight trajectory as it collided with @entity5 , with an entry angle of about 15 degrees , a project researcher writes : ' as can be seen from the picture , the meteorite was out of the field of view of the @entity146 radar and it was below the horizon as seen from @entity148 , so the @entity145 could not see it either			0
' the @entity151 radar in @entity152 might have detected the meteorite if it looked up , but it did n't - as an early - warning radar its mission is to search the narrow strip of space just above the horizon , which a ballistic missile would cross if it ever comes			2
' they do n't ( and should n't ) much care about anything else			0
these radars are not supposed to search the entire sky on a continuous basis - it would be a waste of energy and would decrease the effective detection range			0
' an early - warning radar could see objects at higher elevations ( up to 34.5 degrees in the case of @entity151 ) and does so if it is asked to track a satellite			2
' but you have to ask and since nobody saw the meteorite coming nobody did			0
' the researcher adds that the @entity76 file also includes the fan of the @entity182 radar , built to close the ' eastern gap ' in @entity185 - era @entity5 's early warning radar coverage , but that would have also missed the meteorite			1
so there is nothing wrong with @entity5 's missile defence systems , the blog post says , and the reason the meteorite was not detected was simple - it was not an icbm			0
shattered : the city of @entity14 , 900 miles east of @entity148 and close to the @entity195 border , took the brunt of the impact , with windows across the city shattered and some 1,200 injuries recorded ice hole : experts have been scouring a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of @entity14 believed to have been smashed open when the burning lump of space rock slammed into the @entity39 the researcher concludes on a positive note for the safety of the world , given the number of nuclear weapons still poised in the arsenals of both @entity5 and the @entity84 ' it still leaves an interesting question , ' the researcher writes			1
' what happens if you see a 500 - kt explosion on ( or above ) your soil and have no idea what it is and where it came from ? ' i guess we know now what the @entity5 do - they would rush to upload their dashboard camera videos to @entity229			0

the 10,000 - ton lump of space rock exploded with the force of 25 atom bombs over the city of @entity14 on friday morning
@entity45 experts explain that the country 's early warning system was never meant to track meteorites
