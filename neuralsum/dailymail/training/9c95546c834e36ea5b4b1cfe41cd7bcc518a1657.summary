@entity1 and @entity2 lived a life of luxury that can be seen ' portrayed in glossy magazines ' using @entity7 's credit cards , the jury was told during the trial			1
the @entity10 sisters lavished thousands of pounds of the millionaire 's money a shop til you drop @entity16 trip , a stay in the @entity18 in @entity19 and dozens of items of designer clothing			1
when asked about where they got their expensive clothes , the sisters would say they had bought bargains online			0
mr @entity32 and miss @entity33 – who has her own fortune of £ 20million – were so awash with cash it was only a chance occurrence that uncovered the @entity2 sisters ' lavish spending			1
cookery : miss @entity33 is pictured in her 2006 tv show @entity40 it happened when the sisters ordered a taxi with a firm kept on account by mr @entity32 ’s art company @entity46 , and left it waiting for an age outside the family home			1
irritated by its beeping , 70 - year - old mr @entity32 made enquiries			2
he was shocked to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants to a polo match in @entity58			0
mr @entity32 ’s finance director at @entity46 , @entity60 , told the court that although he had noted @entity2 ’s credit card spending creeping up – with her monthly limit leaping from £ 25,000 to £ 100,000 – he had not yet thought to raise the matter			1
only when the taxi incident happened did he investigate properly and tell mr @entity66 that each month @entity2 was spending on average £ 48,000 and @entity1 £ 28,000			2
@entity2 had spent more than £ 4,700 on flights to @entity16 , where she spent £ 1,850 at high - end fashion store @entity68 and more than £ 2,000 on hotels			1
she paid £ 613 at the @entity70 in @entity16 on june 3 , and two days later had shelled out £ 1,424 at the @entity71			2
in addition , she also withdrew large amounts of cash while she stayed in the city			0
she also used the card to pay a £ 1,280 bill at the @entity18 hotel in @entity19 on the same day that she bought a @entity80 dress for £ 723			1
on june 12 last year she spent £ 5,385 at @entity81 , and £ 2,650 at designer store @entity82			1
the relationship between the @entity2 sisters and the couple collapsed altogether last year after @entity87 's finance director @entity60 , pictured arriving at court , discovered how much the @entity89 had been spending on their credit cards @entity1 visited more high street shops and fewer high fashion boutiques than @entity2 – with @entity94 and @entity95 among them – but still managed to rack up almost £ 5,000 personal expenditure in the month , including cash withdrawals on the company card			2
among other luxury brands the women blew thousands at @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity107 hotel group			0
over the course of a four - year period she splurged £ 58,744 in just 50 transactions at an array of designer shops and spas			0
but other personal assistants not charged with any offence also spent money – at @entity117 ’s nightclub , the @entity119 country venue and on @entity121 shoes			0
@entity122 , @entity123 , defending @entity124 , said of the @entity89 : ‘ they believed they were authorised to incur this personal expenditure			0
’ mr @entity122 told the court that the @entity10 sisters worked long hours for ‘ modest ’ salaries – £ 25,000 for @entity124 and £ 28,000 for her sister – and suggested it was common practice for assistants to be allowed to spend on themselves			0
they would also be able to live rent - free at a flat owned by @entity33 in @entity135 , central @entity81 , the court heard			0
the jury was told @entity2 's average monthly spend was £ 48,000 while @entity1 's was £ 28,000 - compared with the other personal assistants who racked up bills of £ 8,000			2
mr @entity32 's finance director mr @entity60 confronted the sisters about their spending in the kitchen of the @entity87 family home in west @entity81 on july 3 last year			1
the pair admitted lavishing money on themselves but initially offered to make amends and pay it back before the police were called in .			0
