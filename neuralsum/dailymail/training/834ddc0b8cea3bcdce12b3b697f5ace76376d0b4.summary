by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 30 december 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 31 december 2013 @entity1 has revealed he would like to personally apologise to @entity2 for a horror tackle on the midfielder during @entity7 's @entity6 win over @entity8 , but has hit back at critics claiming the forward should have been penalised for a foul on @entity12			1
the @entity7 striker was heavily involved in the @entity6 clash and scored @entity7 's winning goal which incensed @entity8 players as they felt the @entity17 should have been sent off for raking a boot down @entity2 's shin in the fourth minute			1
referee @entity20 awarded @entity8 a free - kick for the challenge but failed to brandish even a yellow card in @entity1 's direction			1
' but i 'm not the referee			0
everyone is entitled to their opinion but we must respect the decisions from the officials			0
' during the match in the first moments , the game was passionate on both sides , but people know i 'm not violent			0
' i was really sad to see @entity45 ( @entity2 ) on the floor - i want to take this opportunity to say sorry			2
' contact : @entity1 ( centre ) does n't believe this tackle on @entity12 ( left ) was a foul no foul ? @entity12 ( centre ) flies through the air after being blocked by @entity1 during @entity7 's win over @entity8 @entity8 manager @entity25 felt as though his side had once again been hard - done by , particularly when @entity1 cut across the run of @entity12 in @entity7 's penalty area with the score at 2 - 1			1
however , @entity20 was looking directly at the incident and decided to let the game continue			0
the 32 - year - old forward feels @entity20 's decision to wave play on was the correct one and does n't believe he fouled @entity8 's star man			1
@entity1 added : ' the ref did his job			2
he was two metres away from us			0
' we ca n't all be the ref and it 's easy for people to talk when they are far away			2
' yes , there was contact , but i did n't commit a foul			0
' taking a dive ? @entity77 claimed @entity12 ( centre ) fell tp ground like ' an acrobatic swimmer ' official : @entity20 ( above ) did n't believe @entity1 's challenge on @entity12 was a foul			1

@entity1 sorry for tackle on @entity8 's @entity2
