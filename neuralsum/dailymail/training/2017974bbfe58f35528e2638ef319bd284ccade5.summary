by @entity0 magnificent palatial gardens , tasteful pastel bunting , pom - pom crown - emblazoned party hats , regally decorated cake pops and a handful of angelic children crowding around a little boy dressed in red , white and blue			1
what could these beautiful images show other than @entity12 ’s first birthday bash ? in reality , the only missing element from this perfectly elegant affair is the prince himself			2
the star of the show in these images is @entity20 , a one - year - old model , and rather than @entity23 , the elegant surroundings are @entity24 in @entity25			0
@entity20 sits on a picnic mat dressed to look like @entity12 celebrating his first birthday on july 22 ' @entity12 's ' guests have all been dressed in quintessentially @entity30 style for the imaged party the classy party was organised by event stylist @entity33 who chanelled the duchess of @entity36 's style to envisage what the party to celebrate @entity12 's first birthday on july 22 could look like			1
@entity33 , who owns party planning boutique @entity41 has been the brains behind many children 's parties for the @entity23 set and knows exactly how it ’s done			1
‘ the style is based on @entity48 's love of a simple , elegant style , ’ explains @entity33			1
@entity33 took her inspiration from the recent @entity52 tour of @entity53 , which offered the perfect opportunity to understand @entity48 ’s baby taste			2
@entity12 earned his fashion stripes back in april during a visit to @entity58 , @entity53 it may look like a palace but the setting for the party is in fact @entity24 in @entity25 too good to eat : crown - emblazoned cake pops in blue - the perfect royal party fare ‘ judging by @entity48 ’s choices for @entity12 's outfits on the trip , her taste is very traditional , ’ @entity33 says			1
‘ so that ’s how we styled the shoot			0
' we included lots of giant balloons , which are a very popular at the moment - as are the tassel garlands			1
’ of course , the party food was not only elegant but perfectly on trend and included cake pops , macaroons and swizzle sticks			1
' for children , cake pops are a neat way of eating cake , often given out at end of parties now instead of a wrapped piece of cake			2
they are totally delicious and just enough as little taster , ’ @entity33 says			2
the clever little bite - sized cakes on a stick , which came from across the pond , are also ever - so - slightly gooier than regular cakes and a little less messy			0
one - year - old @entity20 - aka @entity12 - getting used to wearing a crown at his imaginary party happy birthday ! a crown fit for a prince - just one of the items @entity33 believes would be perfect for the big day ‘ macaroons are obviously a big food trend too and this filters into children 's parties , ' @entity33 adds			1
' for @entity12 we embellished them with the little edible crowns			2
they are delicious and just melt in the mouth			0
‘ marshmallow sticks and chocolate - covered oreos are also big at the moment			0
’ @entity33 also made sure @entity12 's little guests looked the part			1
‘ we wanted the clothing for this special royal event to be quintessentially @entity30 so we selected brands that make timeless clothing to suit the regal birthday theme , ’ she says			0
‘ the girls ' dresses are simple yet extremely elegant in beautiful pastel shades and the boys are dressed in very traditional and classic lines			0
‘ the prince is wearing smocked nautical dungarees by @entity130 as worn by @entity12 whilst on his recent trip to @entity132			2
@entity133 bears ' picnic : two young girls enjoy party food with their furry friends elegant design : how @entity33 imagines @entity48 and @entity140 will celebrate @entity12 's first birthday ' and one of his guests is fashioning a gorgeous romper with a crown motif by the same brand			1
’ and if you ’re planning your own birthday bash ? ‘ my biggest tip would be to create a theme and colour scheme that incorporates your child ’s likes and interests and add a touch of home - made for a unique birthday party style , ’ @entity48 says			0
‘ you could choose a fill - in invitation , a designed one or maybe make your own using your little one ’s hand or foot prints , which adds a lovely personal touch			0
‘ depending on the scale of your party choose your venue with care , it is important to have a dedicated and safe area for the birthday child and their young friends , even if you have older children attending			0
' one of @entity12 's guests gives a little nod to his host with a crown embellished romper ' an intimate family party at home can often a good choice for first birthday parties , ' @entity33 says			1
often at first birthday parties with extended friends and family there are a range of children of different ages			0
‘ this can make choosing the entertainment tricky , ’ she says			0
‘ but you will find your local baby and toddler classes will offer party options to entertain babies , toddlers , younger guests and parents too ! ' soft play is also a way to create a safe space for the birthday boy or girl and you could even bring along toys and ride - ons to create a fun area , ’ she says			0
the vintage sweet table decorated with pastel coloured bunting would appeal to the @entity213 's elegant taste a neat bundle of cutlery sealed with a bow and crown pass the gold parcel - a palace favourite swizzle sticks , which @entity41 ' @entity33 imports from the @entity221 party time ! two perfectly dressed boys enjoy their swizzle sticks hands off ! a bowl of blue and white bonbons adds style to the table the macaroons have been given a regal touch with crown decoration a sunny day and beautiful gardens is all @entity12 needs on july 22			1
