@entity1 president @entity0 has pulled out of today ’s memorial service for @entity3 at @entity4 to attend the lavish wedding of @entity7 ’s daughter			1
the @entity9 service , thought to be the first for a foreigner , had already been rescheduled to accommodate mr @entity0			1
however , mr @entity0 instead spent the weekend in @entity12 at the £ 3million wedding of @entity14			1
his spokesman denied it was a snub to @entity3			0
allies : @entity1 's @entity0 ( left ) and @entity12 's @entity7 pictured together in 2003 prince @entity18 , representing the @entity19 , and prime minister @entity20 will be among 3,000 at the memorial for mr @entity3 , who died in december aged 95			1
the date of the service was originally planned for february 11 , the anniversary of his release from prison in 1990 , but was changed so mr @entity0 , who was preparing for his annual @entity29 address on that date , could attend			2
honour : the service today at @entity4 will be the first for a foreigner @entity1 ’s controversial 71 - year - old leader informed memorial organisers last week that he would now be too busy to join the unique event and would send his deputy and two ministers in his place			1
instead , mr @entity0 spent the weekend at the extravagant wedding of @entity14 , daughter of president @entity7 , 90 , who hosted 4,000 guests at his large estate in the @entity12 capital , @entity45 , for a two - day celebration			1
after mr @entity0 announced he would not be attending in person , @entity47 informed the @entity4 that prince @entity18 would be attending on behalf of the @entity19			0
a spokesman for the @entity4 confirmed that mr @entity0 had sent his apologies , and admitted they were ' disappointed '			0
' clearly we were expecting president @entity0 and we were disappointed that he ca n’t come but we understand that schedules change , ' @entity9 spokesman @entity52 said			2
back home , mr @entity0 ’s decision to spend the weekend with the @entity57 instead of paying tribute to mr @entity3 in @entity59 was being interpreted as a deliberate snub to the former colonial power			1
both white and black @entity1 used @entity63 to express their anger at their leader ’s decision to prioritise the @entity7 wedding over an historic service in honour of mr @entity3			2
at the main @entity1 memorial in the days after mr @entity3 ’s death , which was attended by current and former world leaders , mr @entity0 looked visibly rattled as he was booed loudly and repeatedly by crowds at the stadium in @entity76			2
tensions : many @entity1 are angry at the current government when compared with @entity3 's ideals @entity80 , mr @entity0 ’s official spokesman , said mr @entity0 was too busy with domestic issues to attend the @entity59 event , but denied it could be interpreted as a snub			1
' he has sent the second - highest office [ his deputy president @entity86 ] and two ministers , ' he said			0
' i have seen some articles saying this is a snub			0
this is not a snub – people are wrong			0
' mr @entity0 and the ruling @entity94 will on may 7 run in what are widely expected to be the most hotly - contested parliamentary and provincial elections the former liberation movement since mr @entity3 led it to power in 1994			0
a series of corruption scandals have seen mr @entity0 ’s personal popularity plummet and many now believe the @entity94 could lose its two - thirds parliamentary majority for the first time .			0

first ever @entity9 service for a foreigner had already been *delayed* for @entity0
but he spent the weekend at £ 3m wedding of @entity14 in @entity45
@entity1 vented fury at apparent snub to former colonial power
