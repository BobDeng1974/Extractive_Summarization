however , even mrs @entity10 , 48 , said she was stunned by the severity of his sentence			1
the company director , of @entity45 , @entity46 , said : ‘ i am very , very shocked by the punishment he has been given			2
‘ i do n’t think that is fair at all			0
i think they must have wanted to make an example of him			1
but i think a slap on the wrist would have been sufficient			1
‘ perhaps he could have gone on a driver awareness course , but what he has got from the court is really quite harsh			0
i would not wish that fine on anybody			0
’ @entity62 @entity61 , the traffic policeman who was following @entity6 in @entity45 , said : ‘ the vehicle was driven through the puddle at a relatively fast speed making no attempt to slow down or avoid it			1
‘ as a consequence , a large wave of water absolutely soaked the children and their parents			1
we could hear the screams from the children as they got drenched in the cold , dirty rainwater			1
‘ the motorist drove off			0
fortunately , i was able to witness the whole incident			0
‘ his actions caused distress to the young children			1
‘ in addition , i pointed out the hidden hazards that lie in large puddles and the fact he could have lost control of his vehicle and caused a danger to other road users			2
’ on mr @entity6 ' punishment , @entity10 said : ' i think they must have wanted to make an example of him but i think a slap on the wrist would have been sufficient ' @entity6 , who has been driving for less than a year , will have to pass both his theory and driving test again to regain his licence			1
@entity100 magistrates also ordered him to pay £ 90 court costs and a £ 50 victim surcharge on top of his £ 500			0
last night , he said the loss of his licence meant he faced losing his job because he uses his red @entity106 to drive to work in @entity100 , 25 miles from his home in @entity45			0
he added : ‘ i did not mean to splash the family			0
‘ i knew there was a police car behind me , so why would i do something like that on purpose when they were following ? ‘ i turned round a corner and then went through the puddle and was spotted straight away			2
‘ but if you ask anyone who knows me , i am not the kind of person to do something like that on purpose			0
that ’s not what i am like at all			0
‘ it was one lapse of concentration and nothing more than that			0
people drive through puddles and people do get splashed – it ’s unavoidable unfortunately			2
it really is an everyday occurrence , so , yes , i do feel hard done by			0
’ mr @entity6 was due to appear at @entity133 last saturday , but he did not attend and was punished in his absence			1
he had recently moved house and said he did not receive the summons although unusual , it is not unheard - of for drivers who splash pedestrians to fall foul of police			2
in 2009 , a 29 - year - old @entity142 , from @entity143 , was questioned by @entity144 after she posted a video clip of herself online soaking pedestrians in a craze called ‘ happy splashing ’			0
