practising the simple rules of physics , it seems someone had paid enough attention in class to know that if you fill the well , the bull will rise			0
the bull had fallen into a deep well in a field in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 - a seemingly impossible place for the beast to be pulled from			2
simple physics : @entity22 firefighters worked quickly and cleverly to save this bull , filling the well with water as the bull floated to the top but the crafty @entity22 firemen knew exactly what to do , using a pump to fill the well and rescue the helpless bull from certain death			2
@entity40 , the bull ’s owner had herded the bull into a local field that morning only to find it missing when he returned later that day			0
to his horror , mr @entity40 followed the bull 's panicked cries to the deep well where it was trapped , looking up longingly at its master from the well 's bottom far below			0
@entity22 well : the bull had fallen down the deep well in a field but the firefighters 's quick thinking allowed the bull to reach the top and avoid certain death happy reunion : after the bull was pulled from the well , it was reunited with relieved owner @entity40 he said : ‘ i was very anxious until i heard the bull 's sound in the well			1
’ mr @entity40 called firefighters for help and just 30 minutes later they had filled the well with water allowing the bull to rise to the surface , kicking furiously to stay afloat and make it out unharmed			1
mr @entity40 said : ‘ it 's really smart			0
without them , i really do n't know how to take this giant one out			0
’ thankful owner : mr @entity40 was amazed by his bull 's lucky escape because when he found the beast he had no idea ' take this giant one out '			1

the bull made a lucky escape after quick thinking fire fighters filled the well , allowing the beast to rise to the top and be freed
it had fallen in the well in rural @entity22 but once discovered , it took fire fighters only 30 minutes to rescue
