@entity1 chief executive @entity0 will warn today that @entity2 needs to ' get back in shape ' if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided @entity2 needs to ‘ get back in shape ’ if a public health catastrophe is to be avoided , the head of the @entity1 warns today			1
@entity0 is to launch a national anti-obesity drive in the new year – as a report finds @entity2 is now the second fattest country in @entity10			1
in a clarion call to those recovering from the excesses of @entity14 , mr @entity0 will ask @entity15 to identify tens of thousands of fat patients to be put on anti-diabetes programmes and offered lifestyle advice			1
the @entity1 chief executive will say that losing just 5 to 7 per cent of weight can cut the chance of developing diabetes by almost 60 per cent , according to research			1
the warning comes as a study of 30 @entity10 nations found that only @entity27 has fatter adults than @entity2			1
campaigners said @entity2 needs to make a collective @entity31 ’s resolution to reverse current trends , which suggest two thirds of middle - aged men will be obese in two decades , official data shows			1
mr @entity0 also attacked a ‘ daft ’ @entity36 ruling last week which said obesity should be counted as a disability			1
he said such fatalistic talk should be abandoned in favour of a realisation that it was up to all of us to take responsibility for our health and get in shape			0
‘ the ghost of @entity48 past reminds us that 20 years ago we did n’t have these problems as a nation , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ the ghost of @entity48 future tells us that if we get our act together – as the @entity1 , as parents , as schools , the food industry – we can get back in shape			0
‘ that ’s why the @entity1 is going to be funding a new national programme , proven to work , that will offer tens of thousands of people at risk of diabetes proper support to get healthier , eat better and exercise more			2
’ under the new scheme , gps will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight			2
after tests for pre-diabetes , they will be advised on fitness and diet the extent of @entity2 ’s obesity epidemic was exposed in the latest study by the @entity80			1
its health at a @entity84 2014 report shows 24.7 per cent of @entity2 adults are obese , compared with a @entity10 average of 16.7 per cent			1
@entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 all have obesity levels of less than 13 per cent			0
only @entity27 has higher rates of adult obesity than the @entity2 , at 28.5 per cent			1
the @entity80 report , based on data collected in 2012 , shows @entity2 ’s rate rose from 23 per cent in 2002			2
rankings can not be compared , as some countries in the 2014 report did not feature in 2002			0
obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or more , meaning the person ’s weight is a danger to their health			2
@entity111 is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres			0
a measure of between 18.5 and 25 is healthy			0
independent research earlier this year found that obesity costs @entity2 taxpayers more than the police , prisons and fire service combined			1
mr @entity0 believes anti-obesity schemes will begin saving the @entity1 money within three years			1
under the scheme , gps will be asked to identify patients at risk of diabetes – especially those under 40 who are overweight			2
after tests for pre-diabetes , they will be advised on fitness and diet , followed by regular monitoring			0
earlier this year , a major study suggested a third of @entity2 have borderline diabetes			1
the @entity1 spends £ 10billion a year treating the three million sufferers of the condition – the majority of whom have type two , linked to obesity			2
local @entity1 organisations that have run successful diabetes prevention schemes will be asked to help design the national programme			0
official data suggests that if obesity was reduced from the current rate of almost 25 per cent to the 1993 level of 15 per cent , about five million cases of disease could be prevented in two decades			0
the @entity153 ’s @entity152 said : ‘ after all the food and drink consumed yesterday and today , i would n’t be surprised if the @entity2 had caught up with @entity27 … @entity156 is calling for a national @entity31 ’s resolution … to tackle the aftermath of turkey , pud and cake			1
’ obesity has caused 88,000 avoidable cancer cases , according to @entity164 four in ten cancers could have been prevented over the past five years if @entity2 had adopted healthier lifestyles , research shows			2
a toll of 600,000 avoidable cases includes 314,000 caused by smoking , 145,000 by poor diet – including eating too much red meat – and 88,000 from obesity , says @entity164			0
figures from the charity show that around 40 per cent of the 331,500 new cases diagnosed each year are directly caused by a poor lifestyle			0
according to the statistics , half of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime			0
scientists are urging the public to make simple lifestyle changes to slash the odds			0
researchers from @entity188 – funded by @entity164 – looked at more than 100 existing studies to calculate how many cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were caused by poor lifestyle			0
in addition to smoking , a poor diet and obesity , they found that a further 62,200 cases were down to excess alcohol and 55,900 from spending too much time in the sun. professor @entity200 , a @entity164 statistician , said : ‘ there ’s now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big impact on cancer risk , with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors			0
’ but he added that ‘ we can stack the odds in our favour by taking positive steps now that will help decrease our cancer risk in future ’ .			0
