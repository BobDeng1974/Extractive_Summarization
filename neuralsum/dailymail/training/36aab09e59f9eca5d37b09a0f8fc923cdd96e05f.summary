by @entity0 thanks to gym visits and an exercise regime that includes swimming and power walking , i pride myself on being a @entity6 size ten			2
but there ’s one part of my body that refuses to slim down , that i have always been ashamed of : my thick , shapeless ankles			1
not for me , calves elegantly slimming down to a tapered point just above the heel			2
instead , i have a stubborn chunk of shapeless flesh , a fusion of calf and ankle known as the cankle			2
some people are cursed with cankles because they are overweight or retain fluid there			1
in my case , it ’s down to bad genes			2
i ’ve tried everything i can think of to conceal them , from leggings to full - length skirts			1
so i ’ve adopted a uniform of ankle boots — clinging to a wintry look well into summer			2
can i shake - up my wardrobe and camouflage the dreaded cankle ? the @entity39 ’s fashion editor , @entity40 , gives me her tips … @entity43 dress , £ 95 , coast - @entity45 peep - toe heels , £ 195 , lucychoilondon.com @entity46 says : the perfect optical illusion			1
a maxi dress with a high slit means you show a tantalising side view of leg			0
it ’s important the hemline falls at the ankle — the point where it hits the ankle will break up those chunky cankles			1
my verdict : i usually feel frumpy in long dresses , but i absolutely love this one			0
you get a glimpse of flesh , while the glittery shoes wink through the gap			1
there ’s lots to distract from my cankles			1
plus , the partly covered side view of leg means you only get a cross-section of cankle			0
score : 5/5 cream vest , £ 69 , leather skirt , £ 189 , @entity77 , £ 189 , @entity79 sandals , £ 195 , lkbennett.com @entity46 says : ankle straps draw the eye to a cankle			0
instead , opt for a sling - back shoe with an open or strappy toe			0
the black shoes here have slim straps that make feet and ankles look daintier			1
my verdict : i assumed an ankle strap would give me definition			0
these are pretty and the unusual shape draws the eye away from my cankles			1
however , i think my ankles are just too hefty to pull off this look			1
score : 2/5 lace - detailed dress , £ 179 , @entity103 knee - high boots , £ 265 , lucychoilondon.com @entity46 says : knee - high boots are best if you like dresses but not your ankles			1
detail at the top — such as a tassel , buckle or side seam — will draw the eye away from your cankles			1
avoid detail around the ankle , and choose a slightly shorter skirt to show a bit of knee			0
my verdict : the side seam on the boots creates a slender appearance			0
i love the combination with the dress			0
@entity125 ! score : 3/5 cream jacket , £ 79.99 , @entity128 , £ 35 , top , £ 15 , @entity130 courts , £ 395 , jimmychoo.com @entity46 says : high - waisted skirts lengthens legs and makes ankles appear slimmer , as calves seem longer			1
hemlines should skim the knee or fall just below			0
my verdict : the last time i wore anything this high - waisted was in the @entity140			0
but this look really works — although i got slight vertigo climbing into the @entity143			0
score : 4/5 knit dress , £ 245 , lkbennett.com40 denier tights ( pack of three ) , £ 9.50 , @entity148 courts , £ 99 , mintvelvet.co.uk @entity46 says : black tights are a woman ’s best friend for giving long , lean legs and ankles			1
but stick with black heels , as a contrasting shoe will draw attention to your ankle area			2
and try suede , to blend in with your tights			2
my verdict : this look is more about disguise than contouring			0
it reminds me of a dowdy female frontbencher			0
but suede rather than patent is a great tip. score : 2/5 dress , £ 125 , coast - @entity169 , £ 39 , dunelondon.co.uk @entity46 says : a round - toe shoe creates a blockier look — terrible if you have cankles , as it shortens the foot and leg			2
pointed toes are more elegant , and lengthen the foot			0
my verdict : pointy shoes remind me of bad @entity179 parties where middle - aged women dress as ‘ sexy witches ’			1
but these work ! i may never wear ankle boots again			0

the @entity39 *'s* fashion editor @entity185 reveals tips to hide big ankles
try slashed skirts , pointy shoes and black tights to camouflage cankles
