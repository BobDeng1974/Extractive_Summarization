by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 4 april 2013 @entity1 : a 20th anniversary memorial service will take place later this month the extraordinary impact of the @entity8 ’s marathon @entity1 campaign has been acknowledged in an independent poll marking the 20th anniversary of his murder			1
two thirds of those questioned about the teenager ’s racist killing said the media had played a key role in keeping the case in the spotlight			1
they added this showed campaigning journalism can act as a force for good in @entity23			1
details of the poll , commissioned by the think - tank @entity26 , emerged only a few weeks after one of @entity0 ’s killers finally admitted defeat in his battle to clear his name			1
@entity1 , 37 , one of two men jailed for life last year over @entity0 ’s racist killing , dropped his appeal against conviction			1
his decision was welcomed by @entity0 ’s mother @entity39 , who urged the other man jailed for her son ’s murder , @entity1 , 36 , to follow @entity1 ’s example and drop his appeal			1
@entity1 ’s decision to throw in the towel was a victory for the @entity8 , which for 16 years has campaigned for justice for @entity0			2
in february 1997 , we famously published pictures of the five prime suspects – @entity1 , @entity1 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 – under the headline ‘ murderers ’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong			0
no legal action was ever taken			0
we repeated the front page in july 2006 , and again none of the race - hate yobs issued legal proceedings			0
our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry which branded the @entity66 ‘ institutionally racist ’ , and changes in the justice system which allowed @entity1 , previously acquitted of @entity0 ’s murder , to stand trial again			1
after the two men were found guilty of @entity0 ’s murder in january last year , @entity1 was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months , while @entity1 was given a minimum of 14 years and three months			2
the iconic mail front page from 1997 @entity0 's mother @entity39 's tribute from 2012 as @entity0 ’s family prepares for what is likely to be a hugely poignant memorial service on april 22 , marking exactly two decades since his murder , @entity26 released the findings of a poll it commissioned about the case			1
it surveyed a representative sample of 2,000 adults across @entity23			0
sixty - seven per cent of those questioned agreed that the ‘ role of the media in keeping the @entity1 case in the spotlight showed that campaigning journalism can be a force for good ’			1
only 6 per cent of people disagreed , while the rest were undecided			0
most people questioned in the survey believe that racism in @entity23 has fallen since @entity0 ’s murder but they recognise significant levels of prejudice remain			2
the public also saluted the determination of the @entity1 family			0
an extraordinary 74 per cent believe their campaign for justice shows that ‘ ordinary people who are determined can achieve real change and win justice ’ , with just 4 per cent disagreeing			0
@entity112 , director of @entity26 , said : ‘ this poll shows that the public do believe that the campaign for justice made an important difference			0
‘ hate crimes still happen , but the best way to honour this anniversary is to redouble our efforts to stamp out the prejudices that feed them			0
’ @entity125 mp @entity124 said : ‘ it ’s important to remember that those who killed @entity0 did n’t represent @entity23 then , and racists in 2013 do n’t represent @entity23 now			2
the country is a better place , but we should n’t pretend that the issue has gone away			0

two thirds said media helped keep racist killing in the spotlight
poll finds *majority* believe campaigning journalism ' a force for good '
