the first treatment specifically designed to treat migraines has been developed - a breakthrough experts say is of ' ground - breaking ' importance			1
the new injection gives hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer chronic migraines - the most debilitating type of headaches			1
the jab is made from monoclonal blood protein compounds			1
these are are antibodies - proteins produced by the body to fight injection - specifically engineered to fight the chemical that causes migraines			1
the protein compounds are able to ' mop up ' another protein called calcitonin gene - related peptide ( @entity23 ) , which triggers the pain , nausea and vomiting associated with a migraine			1
a new injection to prevent migraines has been developed for the first time , in a breakthrough experts are calling ' ground - breaking ' in trials of 172 sufferers , scientists found the jab brought ' significant reduction ' in the numbers of hours and days chronic migraine patients suffered headaches			1
the @entity40 defines chronic migraine as more than 15 headache days per month over a three - month period - more than eight migrainous – if it has been ruled out that the headaches are caused by an overuse of medication			2
a migraine is severe recurring headache , usually affecting only one side of the head , characterised by sharp pain and often accompanied by nausea , vomiting , and visual disturbances			1
according to the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , up to four per cent of the world 's adult population have headaches on 15 or more days every month			0
it has identified chronic migraine as more disabling than blindness , paraplegia angina or rheumatoid arthritis			0
it has also categorised migraine at the same level of disability as dementia , quadriplegia and acute psychosis			0
and people with migraines or severe headaches are three times as likely to become depressed than healthy individuals , the @entity54 warns			2
this can lead to sufferers often becoming depressed and unable to cope , says the charity @entity76			2
while internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine , the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood			2
a combination of reactions occur that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( @entity23 ) being produced and released			1
@entity23 causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head			1
this leads to a painful headache , sometimes with aura – meaning the person experiences visual disturbances , dizziness and vertigo – as well as nausea and vomiting			0
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins – antibodies specifically engineered to bind to @entity23 – were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning it did not trigger a migraine			1
@entity107 , director of the @entity109 's clinical research facility , @entity110 , and a trustee of @entity76 , told @entity112 this was a ' landmark ' breakthrough			0
he said : ' this announcement is of ground - breaking importance , as it represents the first potential , specific treatment for chronic migraine ever developed			1
the injection , which is made from proteins called monoclonal blood proteins , is able to ' mop up ' another chemical which triggers migraines when it is released in the brain ' all interested physicians will watch this development with excitement , as it offers a chance to do more for our most disabled migraine patients , as we invest in further research for an eventual cure			1
' the message for people with the condition is that there are real developments which will make substantial improvements to their treatment			2
' he said past medications used to treat migraines – beta - blockers , anti-depressants , and epilepsy medicines – are ' borrowed ' from other specialities , whereas this injection works specifically for migraines			1
while internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine , the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood			2
a combination of chemical reactions occurs that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( @entity23 ) being produced and released			1
@entity23 causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head			1
this leads to a painful headache , sometimes with aura – meaning the person experiences visual disturbances , dizziness and vertigo – as well as nausea and vomiting			0
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins – antibodies specifically engineered to bind to @entity23 – were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning a migraine was not triggered			1
these treatments all have side effects , whereas none have been identified for the new injection			0
it also prevents the onset of migraines , rather than treating them when a headache has come on			0
he said : ' if you have 15 days or more and you 're just chasing the headaches it 's not a good strategy			0
no side effects have been identified			0
as the injection will be expensive , he expects the injections to be offered as a last resort , after the first line treatments such as antidepressants have been tried			0
@entity199 , chief executive of @entity76 , said : ' many chronic migraine patients find existing treatments are ineffective , or cause unpleasant side effects			0
this breakthrough has the potential to give them back a more normal life			0
' due to the way and how long sufferers are affected , people with chronic migraine take considerably more time off work , school , leisure , housework and social activities than episodic migraine patients			0
efficiency is also hit , with work or school productivity more than halved - described as a migraine ' hangover ' by numerous sufferers			2
incapacity for over half a month sometimes means people can not work at all , with some claiming disability living allowance			0
if the treatment given in the trials passes further tests , the injections could become available within a few years			2
the next step will be a phase iii trial on a larger population of people , in which the injection will be tested against a placebo .			0

migraines are triggered by calcitonin gene - related peptide ( @entity23 ) protein
this *widens* blood vessels near to the nerves in the head , causing pain
the new injection contains monoclonal blood protein compounds
these are antibodies engineered to bind to @entity23 and can ' mop it up '
trials found the treatment significantly reduced migraines in sufferers
