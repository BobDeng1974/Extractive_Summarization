and it seems nothing would stop the @entity8 continuing that role last night – not even the crippling form of morning sickness that has plagued her for the last two weeks			2
she made her first formal public appearance since her pregnancy was announced at he @entity16 ceremony in @entity17 , where she presented two awards			2
proud moment : @entity38 , left , receives her runners - up trophy from the @entity8 she stayed on the stage throughout @entity34 's speech and was then on hand to present the @entity16 award on to @entity25			1
runner - up was @entity45 heptathlete @entity38 , who won gold in the @entity47 , and in third place was tennis star @entity49 , who also won gold at the @entity4			1
her decision to honour the engagement after being forced to cancel her last four public appearances is a sign that the 30 - year - old is slowly recovering after spending several days in hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum earlier this month			0
aides said the duchess , a @entity45 ambassador , was keen to attend to pay tribute to the achievements of @entity63 sportsmen and women in a remarkable year for @entity63 sport			2
a fortnight after she fell ill with a crippling form of morning sickness , the @entity8 finally made her first formal public appearance			2
but sources close to @entity8 , less than 12 weeks pregnant , stressed that she would only attend the evening - long event at @entity72 for around 45 minutes before returning home to @entity74 , where she continues to recuperate			1
doctors have warned her that the condition can recur at any time in the first few months of pregnancy - and sometimes even beyond			2
‘ while the @entity8 does not feel ready to attend a four - hour engagement , she is keen to show her support to the @entity63 ’s sportsmen and women at this prestigious event which caps a momentous year for @entity63 sport , ’ said a senior royal source			1
@entity8 attended the event alone as her husband , prince @entity86 , has been forced to return to their rented farmhouse in @entity89 , @entity90 , as he is due on duty as an @entity93 pilot			2

he will return to @entity17 in time for @entity107 but aides have yet to announce whether they plan to join the @entity109 at @entity110 , in line with tradition			0
while it would be extremely unusual for the future king and his wife to miss the annual celebrations on the @entity120 ’s @entity119 estate – including the traditional visit to church on christmas morning – sources have indicated that @entity8 is ‘ seriously ’ considering remaining in @entity123 with her family so she can recover in peace and be closer to hospital if she takes a turn for the worse			2
her decision will be announced in the next day or so			0
handshake : @entity8 hands the @entity130 to chairman of @entity35 @entity34 over to you : @entity22 was in good company as she presented @entity34 with his award by @entity135 he hates being a ‘ celebrity ’ and says he is just a ‘ shy bloke ’ who likes to ride a bike			1
but there was no escaping the limelight when cyclist @entity25 was crowned the @entity16 last night			1
@entity140 , who took @entity142 gold nine days after becoming the first @entity143 to win the @entity144 , was the overwhelming winner after 1.5million members of the public voted			0

@entity140 , 32 , who had been the runaway favourite to win the award , beat heptathlete @entity38 , who took second place , and tennis star @entity49 , who came third			1
@entity140 , a father of two , said : ‘ i ’m not going to swear tonight so i ’m just going to say thank you very much to everyone who picked up the phone and voted			0
