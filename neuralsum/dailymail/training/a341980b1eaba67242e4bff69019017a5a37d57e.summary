by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 15 august 2013 a new mother has died just a week after giving birth to her first daughter after she contracted a vicious flesh - eating bacteria from her episiotomy			1
@entity6 , 29 , passed away at @entity7 on august 8 after giving birth to baby @entity9 with her husband @entity11 by her side on august 1			1
now @entity11 , a childcare assistant , is left to bring up their newborn daughter alone , while he battles to raise awareness of the deadly bacteria that snatched his beloved wife away so suddenly			1
to help with the 20 - hour labor , @entity6 had undergone an episiotomy , a small incision that enlarges the vaginal opening			1
but on returning home , the pain she expected became more severe overnight			2
loss : @entity6 , pictured with her husband @entity11 , has died after she contracted a flesh - eating bacteria after childbirth			1
she had undergone a small incision to help with her birth but it became infected the next morning , she headed to the hospital with a friend , assuming that doctors would just give her antibiotics to manage the pain and swelling - but she never left , the @entity29 reported			1
in a horrifying twist , the young mother , who had prepared so excitedly for her daughter 's arrival , learned that she had contracted a rare , fast - spreading infection called necrotizing fasciitis			1
this is the deadly infection , also referred to as ' flesh - eating bacteria ' , attacks muscles and skin tissue , leaving its victims needing significant amputations			1
around a quarter of victims die			0
the bacteria , most commonly @entity52 , is found naturally in the skin or throat and infections can usually be treated easily			1
new mother : this image shows @entity6 holding baby @entity9 just after she was born on august 1 gorgeous : @entity59 , who is now two weeks old , was not harmed by her mother 's infection necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
' @entity65 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			2
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			1
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
but about a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease			2
but in some cases when it gets through a cut or a scrape , it can produce destructive toxins that infect the tissue - in what @entity11 called the ' perfect storm ' of bacteria which ' came completely out of left field '			1
@entity6 underwent an operation to remove some of the decaying flesh , but her pain still continued			1
doctors planned to take her from the intensive care unit to a @entity125 hospital for reconstructive surgery , but overnight the hospital called @entity11 to say she was deteriorating			1
they also told him to buy some baby formula as @entity6 's body was filled with medications and she would be unable to breastfeed baby @entity131 he explained to the @entity132 : ' from what we were being told and from what we were seeing , [ @entity6 ] did n't have long at all to live at that point			2
' at one point , @entity6 's stomach was cut open to relieve pressure from fluid build - up			1
she only opened her eyes once throughout the entire ordeal , her husband said			0
' the way it was explained to me - that 's stuck with me quite a bit - was that the medicine in her body was fighting to keep her alive but she was fighting to die , ' he said			0
aware that she would not survive another surgery , he decided to remove her tubes to make her feel comfortable before she passed away			0
the family gathered and prayed around her as they said their goodbyes			0
missed : the couple , from @entity156 , @entity157 , had been married for two years and both worked in childcare new mother : @entity6 , who had been excitedly preparing for the birth of her daughter for months , quickly deteriorated after contracting the disease and even surgeries could not stop it spreading ' they said she fought it a lot stronger than most people do , ' said @entity11 , who married @entity6 just over two years ago after they met through a mutual friend			1
' it was the same thing with the pregnancy , there were doctors there ... who said that she was one of the toughest people they 've ever seen at giving birth			0
' the hospital , while it can not comment on the specific case because of confidentiality , said that it will review the case and see whether the incident was under the hospital 's control			0
it hopes to find out where exactly the bacteria originated - outside the hospital , inside or from a germ that was already in the patient 's body , doctors said			1
friends are also helping raise money for @entity6 's funeral costs at a @entity199 page			1
more than $ 13,000 has already been raised , and any money left over will go to @entity9 's education			2
newborn : doctors said that @entity6 was one of the toughest people they 'd seen give birth when she delivered @entity9 during a 20 - hour labor on august 1 @entity6 , who had dreams of opening a childcare center , was remembered as artistic and loving in her obituary			1
' she was an outgoing personality , loved by all of her friends , ' it noted			0
' @entity6 opened her home to many , never turning down a friend in need			2
' @entity11 says he does not want to blame the hospital , but he does wish to raise awareness of the disease			1
' in reality , it could happen to anyone , but it â€™s best to know ways to prevent it , as much as you can , ' he said			0
' i 'm sure there are people trying to figure out how to prevent it and how to stop it , but it needs to be brought a little more to the forefront			0
' an episiotomy is a surgical incision in the perineum , the area between the vagina and the anus , made just before childbirth to enlarge a woman 's vaginal opening			1
the procedure used to be routine to prevent the vagina from tearing , in the belief that this cut would help women heal easier than a spontaneous tear			0
but studies over the past 20 years have shown that the procedure does not offer the tissue any protection			0
cons research shows women with a spontaneous tear actually recover in the same or less time than women who have had an episiotomy			0
women who have had an episiotomy also tend to lose more blood during the delivery and experience more pain during their recovery			2
the tear also has a greater chance of becoming larger and research shows it increases the risk of tearing in a second birth			0
it also increases the risk of infection			0
the @entity268 and other experts now agree that the procedure should n't be done routinely			0
@entity271 but if a baby is very large or in an abnormal position and a doctor needs space for forceps , an episiotomy can be carried out			0
it can also help when the baby needs to be delivered as quickly as possible - if it is experiencing difficulties such as a drop in heart rate			2
mothers - to - be are encouraged to speak with their practitioner to find out in what conditions he or she would perform an episiotomy			2
midwives carry out the procedure much less than obstetricians .			0

@entity6 underwent an episiotomy - a small incision to enlarge the vaginal opening to help childbirth - when she had daughter @entity9
