by @entity0 he is the made in @entity0 lothario who 's affectionately dubbed ' pug ' by his co-stars and has a tendency to fall in love with most of the girls on the show			1
but this season , @entity0 promised us we would see a more sensitive side to the usually outspoken womaniser - even if he 's yet to prove it			1
whether it 's his pensive glances across the @entity17 or romantic @entity19 rambles , love him or hate him , @entity14 is one of the reasons we keep tuning into the @entity22 show			0
and now , reality tv 's most notorious man about town has launched a blog with @entity27 , where he will be providing his own take on each episode and giving fans a glimpse into the glamorous life of @entity34 's resident @entity33			1
here , we bring you @entity0 's first installment			1
the author himself : @entity0 has launched a brand new blog with @entity27			1
' @entity40 ' will delve deep into @entity14 's innermost thoughts and give readers a glimpse into his glamorous lifestyle welcome to my first ever blog for the @entity27			1
i am @entity0 , best known for being on the @entity22 reality show made in @entity0 , and the good people at @entity49 online have kindly asked me to write a column entitled ' @entity40 ' ( glad you see what they did there )			1
the other part of the masthead states : ' out and about with made in @entity0 ’s @entity57 '			1
well i suppose i have picked up a bit of a reputation on the show , so ' @entity57 ' is to be expected – but hopefully you will get a better idea of my life over the next few weeks with a quick trip around my guide to modern living for the metrosexual male			0
welcome to his world : along the journey we will be having a look at some of @entity0 's favourite things : adrenalin sports , fine - dining , luxury travel , fast cars and some even faster women along the journey we will be having a look at some of my favourite things – adrenalin sports , fine - dining , luxury travel , fashion , male grooming , health , fitness , fast cars and possibly some even faster women			1
for those of you who do n't follow the @entity0 show , it ’s a @entity94 award winning tv programme that is now in its sixth series on @entity22			1
it ’s all about the loves and lives of a group of young people who live in and around the @entity34 area of @entity101			0
the show airs every monday at 10pm on @entity22 for the next 12 weeks and i ’m going to give you a running commentary of the main events just after it finishes at 11pm every monday			0
i ’m also going to do other blogs which will consist of other aspects of my life outside of the show , and those will come out most thursdays			0
so here goes for my first blog about made in @entity113 six , episode one			0
the show opens with one of my psychotherapy sessions in @entity118			0
at the end of the last series i had rather acrimonious split from my then - girlfriend @entity0 and was accused of having fidelity issues			1
i thought it might be worth exploring these parts of my psyche in more depth and i have to say although i was nervous at first i feel as thought i get quite a lot from these sessions and continue to take them both on - and - off camera			0
describing myself as an entirely changed man is n’t yet hugely accurate but at least i am trying to change			0
slightly less therapeutic was when my ex @entity0 revealed on the show , that she thought i had cheated on her with at least four women			1
case of the ex : ' it was apparent from yesterday evening 's show that @entity0 is n't going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating , ' observes @entity0 now , i have to say i ’m glad this is all in the past now , and have since fully apologised to her for my behaviour			1
perhaps i was on the rebound from my relationship with @entity147 , but real feelings did develop for @entity0 and i certainly did n’t want to hurt her			2
but perhaps my wiser friends who warned me i was making a mistake rushing into another relationship so quickly were right after all			0
it was apparent from yesterday evening ’s show that @entity0 is n’t going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating			1
she gave short shrift to a would - be new suitor at the pool - side party and the resulting scene was painful to watch			0
@entity0 was approached by a young guy called @entity160 asking her for a date			2
she treated him to a dose of her trademark froideur , and then nerves got the better of the poor guy , he shook @entity0 ’s hand a couple of times too many and she shot him down in flames , much to @entity0 ’s amusement			2
@entity172 : new boys @entity160 and @entity174 , prior to @entity160 's unsuccessful attempt to get @entity0 on a date my other ex , @entity147 does n't seem to have had much luck over the summer either and has managed to lose five phones in swift succession			2
shares in @entity182 are in great shape as a result , but her relationship with @entity186 did n't appear to be doing quite so well			0
i paid her a visit on a purely platonic basis at the end of the episode to see how she was bearing up after a fierce row , only to face accusations of getting involved in things that are none of my business			0
well she ’s still a good friend and i do care about her , so what ’s the crime in that ? all that was left to do then was to have a nice atmospheric @entity202 shot of me walking through @entity203 , whilst the credits rolled and the @entity0 theme tune ' @entity206 ' by @entity207 played in the background			2
verge of tears : @entity147 's cordial chat with @entity0 i genuinely believe this will be the best series yet			2
welcome back to @entity0 everyone			2
lots of love , as always , @entity0			2
xxx @entity218 – catchphrase of the week comes courtesy of the wonderfully eccentric @entity221			0
when questioned by @entity0 of how he ended up naked in the pool , he coolly answered : ' things happen ' .			0

@entity0 is our ... @entity40 ( see what we did there ? )
he will blog *straight* after ever @entity0 show - giving you all the *insider* gossip
find out what he gets up to when filming is over
get ready for : ' @entity240 sports , fast cars and some even faster women '
