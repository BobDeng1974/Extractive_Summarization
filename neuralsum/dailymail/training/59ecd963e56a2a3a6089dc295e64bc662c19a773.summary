by @entity0 more than half of homeowners think now is a good time to sell after house prices rose nearly £ 50 a day during the past 12 months			1
the value of the average home jumped by £ 17,261 to £ 186,322 in the year to july – or £ 47.29 a day – according to @entity7			2
the 10.2 per cent rise is the biggest since the run on @entity10 in september 2007 heralded the start of @entity13 ’s financial crisis			2
for sale : more than half of homeowners think now is a good time to sell , according to a new report surging prices have led a record proportion of homeowners to believe it is ‘ a good time to sell ’ , according to a @entity7 report – creating the right conditions for a surge in the number of homes coming on to the market			1
but signs that the housing market is accelerating will fuel speculation that the first interest rate rise since july 2007 could be just months away			1
the @entity32 is expected to freeze rates at 0.5 per cent when its latest meeting ends at noon today , but experts say an increase before the end of the year is a distinct possibility			0
a poll by @entity41 for @entity42 last night showed that half of mortgage holders , or 49 per cent , are already cutting back their spending over concerns that the rate may rise			1
others have also been affected by fears of an increase , with 35 per cent of all adults tightening their purse strings in anticipation of higher rates			2
@entity55 , chief @entity13 economist at @entity56 , said : ‘ far from slowing , house price inflation may even be accelerating			0
the @entity13 is cruising at strong growth rates			0
we expect the @entity32 to respond by hiking rates in november			0
’ the @entity7 report found the average house price in the @entity13 rose by 1.4 per cent in july alone – the equivalent of £ 80 a day			0
@entity62 and the @entity63 have led the recovery in the housing market but there are signs that it is spreading elsewhere , with hotspots springing up in the regions			1
@entity71 , mortgages director at @entity7 , said : ‘ rising prices mean people think it is a good time to sell			0
much of the inflation is coming from @entity62 and the @entity63			1
’ priced out : the proportion of people who think it is a good time to buy has fallen to its lowest level on record @entity7 said 57 per cent of those questioned believed the next 12 months would be ‘ a good time to sell ’ , while only 32 per cent felt it would be ‘ a bad time ’			0
the key figure is the difference between the two percentages , which is the biggest since @entity7 started collecting the data in april 2011 – suggesting confidence among sellers is sky high			0
but the proportion of people who think it is a good time to buy has fallen to its lowest level on record as soaring prices and fears of higher interest rates dent confidence			2
estate agents in @entity62 said increasing numbers of homeowners are selling up and leaving the capital for the regions			1
@entity102 , of @entity103 in the @entity104 , said : ‘ it has been clear since late last year that the @entity62 ripple had taken effect			2
people selling up in the capital and looking to upsize to larger family homes are clearly fuelling price growth in regional areas			0
‘ it is good for sellers who are still looking to move outside @entity62 where prices still have lots to make up on @entity62 , meaning a new lifestyle , bigger home and perhaps reducing or losing their mortgage debt altogether before any interest rates rises kick in			1

market acceleration will fuel speculation of *imminent* interest rate rise
poll shows half of homeowners are already expecting higher mortgage costs
@entity62 and @entity63 have led boom but there are signs it is spreading
