by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:03 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 05:54 est , 14 march 2014 @entity4 was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes			1
the chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to the threshold in next week ’s budget , after figures showed millions more are being sucked into the higher rate tax			2
the government argues that it has cut taxes for all workers by repeatedly increasing the amount they can earn before paying any income tax at all , which will reach £ 10,000 next month			1
reject : chancellor of the exchequer @entity21 is likely to refuse to listen to calls ahead of next week 's budget to ease the burden on middle - class taxpayers but they are facing growing demands to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band since 2010 , with mps arguing many of these people are on middling incomes			1
official figures show that the top 25 per cent of earners – anyone on £ 33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent of the country ’s total £ 167billion of income tax this year			1
by contrast , the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent			0
when the @entity40 came to power in may 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £ 43,875			1
if @entity21 had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of £ 50,000 , according to calculations by accountants @entity52			1
but since 2010 mr @entity21 has repeatedly frozen or lowered this threshold – meaning hundreds of thousands have been dragged in			0
as a result , some 4.4million people now pay the 40p rate , up from just 3.02million when the @entity40 came to power and 1.35million in 1988			1
ministers insist that everyone earning up to £ 100,000 has benefited from the increases in the basic threshold – though admit that higher rate taxpayers have seen much less significant benefits			1
@entity4 last night warned @entity67 mps agitating for a hike in the 40p threshold that they risk undermining the credit the party should be getting from voters for the new basic threshold			0
‘ if we as @entity67 go on and on about the higher rate versus the personal allowance , we ’re obscuring a massive tax cut we have given every person who earns under £ 100,000 , ’ said one source			2
but @entity81 , the @entity81 mp for @entity82 and @entity83 , said : ‘ the 40p rate was designed to tax the rich , but now clobbers the middle classes			2
yes , take the poor out of tax – but do it by cutting government spending , not at the expense of aspirational @entity91			2
’ his views were echoed by @entity93 , the chief economist at centre - left think tank @entity94 , who said : ‘ people are being taxed too much on income but not enough on property			0
this is especially true in @entity100 , where a £ 41,000 salary does n’t make you rich but does take you into the higher income tax bracket			2
the tax system should be updated to reflect how incomes have grown since 1988			0
’ @entity108 , speaking on a trip to @entity107 , insisted higher rate taxpayers earning up to £ 100,000 had also benefited from the increases in the basic - rate threshold			1
‘ what i am determined to do is to go on delivering tax cuts for low and middle income earners and from april this year there will be £ 10,000 you can earn before you start paying tax and that has been benefiting everybody earning up to £ 100,000 , ’ the prime minister said			1
‘ that ’s a significant tax cut , a huge change			0
the point is people on the upper rate have benefited from the £ 10,000 tax - free income			2
’ @entity67 mp for @entity128 @entity127 said : ‘ the chancellor ’s made clear he believes the most effective way to support low and middle income earners is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn			0
‘ this is why he has increased the personal allowance			0
these increases are aimed at the less well - off , but higher - rate taxpayers have also benefited			0
indeed , they are better off than if the higher rate threshold had increased with inflation			0
’ official figures show that in 2013 - 14 , the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax , while the top ten per cent , on £ 47,913 or more , will account for 59 per cent			1
the top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent , or £ 47billion			0
the @entity144 said that thanks to the £ 10,000 allowance , in 2013 - 14 , higher rate taxpayers are about £ 45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation .			0

middle - earners hit as tax has not kept pace with inflation
top 25 per cent of earners – anyone on £ 33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent of the country ’s total income tax
*conservative* mp calls for government spending cuts
*46* per cent increase in 40p tax rate payers since @entity40 came to power
ministers claim that anyone earning under £ 100,000 is better off
