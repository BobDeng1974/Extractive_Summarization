by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , pictured , the @entity3 , has revealed plans to slash a bonus paid out to those who delay claiming their state pensions millions of @entity8 have been warned their state pension payout will be hit by controversial changes sneaked out by the government before ministers head off on holiday			1
at present , anybody can decide to delay claiming their state pension - and get a bonus worth around 10 per cent a year on their unclaimed state pension			1
more than 1.2million pensioners in @entity8 currently receive a higher state pension because they deferred it , typically for a few years although many delay for a decade			1
but @entity2 , the @entity23 , has revealed plans to slash this bonus in a move which will hit everybody who reaches state pension age on or after 6 april 2016			1
rather than a bonus worth 10.4 per cent a year of their unclaimed state pension , they will get a bonus worth only 5.8 per cent a year			1
in a further blow , the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to them when they eventually decide to start claiming their state pension			0
at present , they can either take a lump sum when they begin to claim the pension , or simply receive the higher weekly amount			0
from april 2016 , the chance to take the lump sum , which is popular with pensioners who often use the money to indulge themselves with a holiday or a new kitchen , is being axed			1
mr @entity2 came under fire today for putting out the statement about the explosive change on the last day of @entity54 before the long summer recess begins			0
it was one of 31 ‘ written ministerial statements ’ put out raising suspicions that the @entity11 was trying to bury the bad news			0
@entity60 , head of pensions research at the financial advisers @entity62 , said : ‘ the government is using the last day of term to shovel out the less popular outstanding announcements before heading off on holiday			0
’ the impact of the technical change is eye - watering for future generations of pensioners who want to defer their state pension in order to receive a higher amount in the future			2
take the example of two 65 - year - old men who retire this year – mr @entity78 receives his full state pension , worth £ 113.10 a week , and mr @entity80 defers it for ten years			2
mr @entity80 begins to receive his higher state pension in 2024			0
by 2030 , the total amount that he has received from his state pension is higher than the total amount received by mr @entity78			0
that is , he is better off after just six years of claiming his state pension			0
under the new system , it would take him 14 years of claiming his state pension after the ten - year deferral to be better off than mr @entity78 , according to @entity62			2
but the problem for mr @entity80 is that he will be nearly 90 by the time he reaches this moment , which is quite a gamble to take as he might die in his 60s , 70s or 80s			0
in a further blow , the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to pensioners when they eventually decide to start claiming state pension @entity97 , retirement director at the investment company @entity99 said : ‘ it will be a big reduction in what people who defer their pension today under the current rules enjoy			2
‘ the new state pension [ which comes into force in april 2016 ] is immensely complicated and there are winners and losers depending on whatever side of it you fall			1
’ anybody who has already deferred their pension will not be affected by the changes , and will continue to accrue a higher state pension at the current rate of 10.4 per cent a year			2
people who reach state pension age before 6 april 2016 will also be able to defer under the current terms			1
but the change will hit anybody who reaches state pension age on or after 6 april 2016 and would like to defer their state pension			1
on 6 april 2016 , the state pension age for a man will still be 65 and it will be around 63 for a woman			1
the state pension age is currently being increased to 65 for men and women in 2018 , 66 in 2020 , 67 by 2028 and will continue to rise , expected to reach 68 by 2036			1
a spokesman for the @entity132 , which was advised by the @entity133 , said : ‘ it is important to set a fair deferral rate for the new state pension			0
’ @entity136 , co-founder of the @entity137 , which campaigns for fairness between the generations , said : ‘ this is a good step towards addressing increasing longevity but much more needs to be done			0
‘ a brave government would stop paying the state pension altogether to wealthy pensioners for the sake of younger generations already over-burdened with debt			0

currently pensioners get extra ten per cent on unclaimed state pensions
but pensions minister @entity2 has revealed plans to slash the bonus
move will hit everybody who reaches state pension age from april 2016
the changes were sneaked out by @entity11 before its summer break
