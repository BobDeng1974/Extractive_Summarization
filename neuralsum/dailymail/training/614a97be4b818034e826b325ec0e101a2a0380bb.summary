by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 20:00 est , 1 november 2012 @entity3 's oaks could be the next trees to fall victim to diseases threatening our countryside , experts have warned			1
they say that oaks are ' under assault ' from at least two new infections , with up to half of the trees in some forests displaying signs of disease			2
the warning comes after the government 's chief scientist said it could be too late to stop the spread of ash dieback , a fungal disease threatening 80 million ash trees			1
under threat : experts have already warned that the battle against the ash dieback could already be lost , with the killer fungus that causes it now discovered in 30 sites in the @entity29 the study , published yesterday by the @entity31 , reveals how @entity29 's woodlands are under threat from pests and diseases			1
it warns horse chestnuts are at risk from a disease called bleeding canker , and the @entity42 skyline could be changed by ' plane wilt ' , which threatens plane trees these are found in many cities because of their resistance to pollution			2
in total , 25 new pests and diseases are either already established , recently arriving , on their way or seen as likely threats to @entity29 's trees , woods and forests			0
the report warns : ' even @entity3 oaks are in trouble , declining under assault from two new , as yet incompletely understood conditions			0
' the oak – our most common woodland tree which is often used as a symbol for @entity3 – is threatened by two of the top five diseases ; ' acute and chronic oak decline ' , and the ' oak processionary moth '			1
@entity71 , of @entity72 , said of acute oak decline : ' its impact is going to be far greater than that of ash dieback			1
there is not a forester in @entity29 who is not terrified of this one			0
' the oak is the country 's dominant tree because of its size , importance and history			1
we really could lose it because there is not a cure			0
' the other danger is from the oak processionary moth , first reported in south - west @entity42 in 2006			0
the report said : ' while the caterpillars of the moth can strip trees bare of their leaves , the key concern is the caterpillar 's hairs , which can cause severe allergic , potentially fatal reactions in people and animals			0
' dr @entity104 , a woodland ecologist from @entity105 , said the future of our oaks was at a ' crossroads ' because of the threat from acute oak decline			0
' what is particularly concerning is the disease has attacked old trees , ' he added			2
' if it takes out younger trees it does not matter too much , but if it takes out 300 - year - old ones , they take longer to replace and support more insects			0
' @entity123 mp @entity122 , who co-wrote the study , said : ' we are seeing a torrent of new pests and diseases , the majority imported accidentally , threatening our iconic and much - loved native trees			1

@entity123 mp @entity122 has attacked the government for failing to deal with the problem
experts say the impact could be worse than the fate of the ash tree
