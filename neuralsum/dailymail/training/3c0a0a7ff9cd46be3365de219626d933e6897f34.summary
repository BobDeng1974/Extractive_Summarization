his delighted mother , @entity23 , 48 , said : ' it was so wonderful to see @entity1 do all these events , he looked marvellous running down the street , it is nothing short of a miracle			1
' he loved doing the event , he felt like an @entity30 athlete			0
he now wants to compete in the @entity30 when he ’s older			0

he took a short break during the swim but he took it all in his stride			0

' the cycling part he thought because it was downhill it was too easy and he wanted a bit more of a challenge			0
' he is full of energy			0
apart from a slightly quirky walk he is just the same as anybody else			2
' it ’s astounding to think that just two years ago @entity1 could n’t walk without the aid of his walker or his wheelchair , and he would get around his home on his hands and knees			1
