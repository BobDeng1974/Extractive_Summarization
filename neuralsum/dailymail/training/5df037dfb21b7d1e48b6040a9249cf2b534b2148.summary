@entity0 was playing left back for @entity1 when he got a call from the chief executive @entity3 in august last year			1
‘ @entity9 have made an offer , we ’ve agreed a fee and it ’s up to you , ’ is football code for one thing : pack your bags			1
it is fair to say , after listening to @entity0 at @entity16 ’s training centre this week , he has never really understood the reasons why @entity18 played him in defence during his first season at @entity21			1
@entity0 has been called up to the @entity16 squad by @entity23 after more than two years out @entity0 has always been a forward and has been in fine form for @entity9 after a move from @entity1 @entity0 , 30 , has always been a forward and he has been in sparkling form in a number of advanced roles for @entity31 ’s upwardly mobile @entity9 team this season			1
here he is , then , back in the @entity16 squad more than two years after his last appearance for the national team , against @entity36			1
it feels good to be back			0
‘ i ’m honest enough to think my @entity16 career had gone , ’ he admitted			1
‘ i had n’t been picked for two - and - a - half years and i thought @entity23 would go with the younger players			2
but you ’ve just got to keep playing well and hopefully knock on the door			0
i am over the moon to be here			0
’ @entity0 ’s flexibility appeals to @entity23 and is something that was picked up on by @entity16 scouts when he drifted in from the right and scored a beauty with his left foot against @entity50 in august			1
@entity23 gives his instructions to his stars including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity0 @entity0 is back in the @entity16 squad more than two years after his last appearance for the national team @entity23 monitored his form and popped his head around the dressing - room door at @entity60 a few times to speak to @entity31 about some of his @entity64 players			1
@entity0 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , who returned as a substitute against @entity69 last weekend , are all eligible to play for @entity16			1
‘ he has been coming the last couple of weeks and has been in the changing room to see @entity31 and i ’ve spoken to him a couple of times , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ i knew he was there to watch certain players in our team because the manager told me			0
‘ my form for @entity9 has helped and the way the team has been playing has helped me get noticed by @entity23			2
he spoke to our manager about it and the certain positions that i ’ve been playing			0
‘ when i signed for @entity9 , @entity31 told me that if he got the chance , he ’d want me to play in the middle at times			2
he said i ’d start as a wide man to provide for @entity67 but @entity67 got injured			0
@entity23 monitored @entity0 's form and popped his head around the dressing - room door at @entity60 @entity0 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 are all eligible to play for @entity16 at @entity9 ‘ this season with the lads like ( @entity96 ) @entity95 and ( @entity98 ) @entity97 and the pace on the counter-attack , he wanted to make it more so we could break on teams			1
‘ i ’ve played in the three in the middle and off the front man			0
i ’m really enjoying it			0
’ the variety has whetted @entity0 ’s appetite , drawing more out of him than at any other time of a career that had taken him to @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity69 , and @entity1			1
he enjoys the demands of the no 10 role , the deep - lying creator for @entity95 and @entity97			0
‘ wingers tend to move inside as they get older — @entity117 did it , ’ he added			0
‘ the manager has seen something in my game which made him think i could play there			0
he wants me to get on the ball more and counter-attack			0
’ @entity0 started out on the left all those years ago when he was part of the @entity111 squad that won the @entity127 in 2004			2
a decade later he has been rebuilt at @entity9 , rekindling his enthusiasm for football and reminding @entity23 that he has game - changing qualities when he is in possession			1
playing left back at @entity1 feels a long time ago			2
@entity0 never really understood why @entity18 played him in defence during his first year at @entity21 ‘ it is not my natural position but i knew from then it was the time for me to move , ’ he added			1
‘ i was getting signals other players were coming in			0
‘ i had discussions with the manager and was n’t promised i would be in the team most weeks			0
i knew he was buying a lot of players , probably a lot in my position			0
‘ i was getting used at left back when i was a winger			0
‘ i think you know when the writing is on the wall for you under a manager or at a club			0
@entity9 came at a good time for me to work for a manager who wanted me to play every week			2
‘ @entity1 is a great club and not many people walk out of there easily			2
’ he has recovered at @entity9 and is now preparing for the @entity157 qualifier against @entity158 at @entity159 on saturday			1
only a few weeks ago , new @entity16 captain @entity53 was sent off at @entity160 for a reckless challenge on @entity0 in a @entity163 fixture			1
‘ i have n’t mentioned it yet , but it was just a mistimed tackle , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ he got his punishment for it			0
’ and after more than two years out of the @entity16 team , @entity0 has more than served his time , too			1
after more than two years out of the @entity16 team , midfielder @entity0 has more than served his time @entity0 is set to represent @entity16 against @entity158 on saturday night at @entity159 in their friendly			1

@entity0 is set to star for @entity16 against @entity158 on saturday
