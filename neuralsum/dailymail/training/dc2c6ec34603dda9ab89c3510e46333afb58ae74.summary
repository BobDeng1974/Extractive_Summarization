while the youngster , from @entity18 , received positive comments from the judges , there were concerns that he is too young to cope with fame , should he progress to the final stages of the competition			1
the five - year - old , dressed in a black baseball cap and a t - shirt with his name on it , performed an impressive dance routine and was given a ' yes ' by all four judges			1
but viewers branded the decision ' inappropriate ' and called on @entity34 to bring in new rules to ' stop this happening '			0
fears for @entity38 renewed the controversy surrounding child performers on the programme , which drew hundreds of complaints in 2009 when two child singers , @entity45 and @entity46 , cried due to the pressure of performing live			0

' there was also criticism of parents who allow their young children to go on to the programme			2
@entity95 , director of anti-bullying and child protection charity @entity97 , said : ' we have in the past been concerned by a trend in some of these reality shows to have much younger children … the main concern being that a young child ca n't give informed consent to the consequences of the attention and exposure , to that degree			1
' the programme makers of course say there are lots of safeguards in place … but when it does go wrong , who knows how and when the child could break down and not cope			0
' a spokesman for @entity8 's @entity7 said welfare of contestants was the show 's ' number one priority '			0
