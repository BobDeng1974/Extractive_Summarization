as @entity1 suggestively asked @entity2 to help unfasten her dress , it was the steamy love scene fans had been waiting for			1
but while most of the drama ’s huge audience of viewers were transfixed by the unfolding romance , some were left scratching their heads with the question – how did she put on the gown in the first place without assistance ? the strong - willed servant , played by @entity16 , 22 , told @entity18 ’s @entity17 that she needed his help to remove the dress as it undid from the back			1
however , it was never explained how , this being the case , she had squeezed into the outfit unaided in the first place			0
with no sense of time passing , other viewers expressed puzzlement at how quickly the story was progressing , with @entity1 marrying @entity2 just minutes after they first kissed on screen			1
also , @entity50 , the other object of @entity17 ’s brooding affections , gave birth just one episode after dramatically announcing she was pregnant			0
despite these minor concerns the vast majority of the audience still seem enthralled by the @entity59 - set adventure , based on the novels by @entity61			0
just as the original 1970s series turned @entity63 into a global sex symbol , the hunky @entity18 , 31 , is fast becoming the nation ’s new favourite heartthrob			0
pillow talk : fans of the @entity38 drama took to @entity39 during the episode to joke it had been a clever ploy to lure @entity2 between the sheets morning after : last weekend ’s episode attracted 6.2million viewers , thanks in part to regular glimpses of the @entity59 hero 's toned torso viewing figures have been consistently impressive , with last weekend ’s episode attracting 6.2million viewers and each of the first three instalments of the eight - part breaking the six million mark			1
but with such large audiences it becomes difficult to please everyone and the show has found some fans poking fun at it online			2
after @entity1 and @entity2 spent the night together , one tweeted : ‘ enjoying poldark great chemistry between @entity18 and @entity16 - but how did @entity1 get the dress done up ? ! ’ while another added : ‘ okay @entity1 i get it you need help getting your dress off * wink wink * but how exactly did you do it up in the first place ? ’ a third joked : ‘ @entity101			1
as a costume fairy , i have to ask , if she needed help getting out of the dress ... who got her into the dress [ sic ]			1
’ other viewers seemed fazed by the pace of the script			2
fans pointed out that barely ten minutes elapsed between the scenes where @entity17 first kissed @entity1 and the pair tying the knot on screen			2
others were left bemused that @entity50 , played by @entity116 , revealed she was pregnant at the end of the second episode and then gave birth during the third			0
hunky hero : just as the original 1970s series turned @entity63 into a global sex symbol , @entity18 ( pictured ) is fast becoming the nation ’s new favourite heartthrob one person posted on @entity39 : ‘ writers of @entity128 will see how to move the plotline along			1
first kiss to wedding in five minutes ! ’ but another complained : ‘ i ’m annoyed with @entity2			1
is n’t the whole point the tension between @entity2 and @entity1 ? what now ? ’ writing about @entity50 ’s pregnancy , a fan added : ‘ @entity17 is rather good , would watch the next one now			2
@entity139 if you are pregnant in @entity17 times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes			0
’ complaints have previously been raised about the make - up in the programme			0
some have claimed that @entity2 ’s scar , a souvenir from his time fighting in the @entity149 , looks like mascara or hair dye running down his face			2
others have pointed to @entity154 appeared to be wearing perfect make up , despite having just escaped crushing poverty			0
a spokesman for the @entity17 production team said : ‘ of @entity1 could have got the dress off by herself ! ! ! but why the hell would she want to ? ’			0

@entity16 's character needed @entity2 's his help to remove dress
but confused fans wanted to know how she put it on without assistance
viewers took to @entity39 to pose this very question , with many joking it had been a clever ploy to lure @entity2 between the sheets
