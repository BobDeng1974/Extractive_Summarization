by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 25 july 2013 @entity2 @entity1 thought it was the luckiest day of his life when he scooped £ 35,000 on @entity7 quiz show @entity5			1
but it was a windfall that would land the 43 - year - old in prison			2
amid the celebrations , @entity1 had forgotten one important point			1
he was declared bankrupt in november 2011 , owing creditors £ 61,438 , and was obliged by law to declare his winnings			2
@entity16 : bankrupt plasterer @entity17 blew the winnings from his appearance on @entity21 show ( pictured ) @entity5 before paying off his creditors but instead of informing the @entity23 , he put the cash in his @entity26 account and then spent the lot within three months			2
the winnings went on plane tickets , jewellery and hotels			1
@entity1 's triumph on the popular @entity21 show was brought to an end after an eagle - eyed viewer notified the authorities			1
the tip - off sparked an investigation by the @entity38 and prosecution by the @entity40			1
at @entity41 , @entity1 , from @entity42 in @entity43 , lost an appeal against the 13 - week prison sentence imposed by magistrates for his failure to declare all the assets in his estate			1
@entity1 went on a three - month spending spree following his jackpot win on @entity5			1
in that time he clocked up : @entity53 , barrister for the quiz show champ , told the court : ' what should have been a joyful moment has become a nightmare for him			0
' for a man who has never been in trouble before and has worked hard all his life to suddenly make such a decision and find himself facing a custodial sentence , one can only imagine the impact it ’s had on him			0
' @entity1 had admitted the offence at @entity67 in april and also pleaded guilty to removing the money from his account contrary to the @entity70			1
as well as jail , magistrates ordered him to pay £ 3,418 costs , but immediately granted him bail until the appeal was heard			0
unlike @entity5 , he did not emerge from the hearing a winner			0
@entity79 had hoped to start a new career as a teacher , but that hope has been scuppered by the conviction			1
judge @entity84 told him : ' you were a man of good character until this and there is to be no stigma or sense that because you were a bankrupt it makes it worse			0
' a lot of decent people end up being bankrupt			0
' but this was a flagrant breach of your duty to the @entity23 , and you spent the money quickly			0
' after the case @entity99 , @entity100 and skills deputy chief investigations officer , said : ' mr @entity1 thought he could get away with taking the money he had won and not informing the @entity23 who could have used it to pay the creditors in his bankruptcy			2
' he had , however , appeared publically on a television quiz show and was seen by people affected by his actions			0
' this sentence should serve as a reminder that the rules of bankruptcy are there for a reason and must be followed			0
the courts take criminal offences like these very seriously			0
