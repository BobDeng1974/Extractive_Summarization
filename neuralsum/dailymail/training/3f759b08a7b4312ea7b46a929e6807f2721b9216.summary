embracing fashion : @entity7 , 54 , says that older women are often neglected by the fashion industry , despite them representing a larger portion of the market , and hopes this range will help change that ( dress , £ 50 ) how to look good over 50 : @entity7 says that she has made key adjustments to pieces to ensure that they accentuate a woman 's best assets ( blouse , £ 29 ) @entity62 chic : @entity7 says that this @entity64 trench is her favourite piece from the range because it makes her feel like a chic @entity68 lady ( coat , £ 40 ) ' my mum is 74 and she loves fashion , my daughter is 20 and she loves it too			1
i 've always said it 's an area that we 've neglected and shame on us			2
' @entity7 has lent her expertise to the brand and has provided the designers with advice on how to make clothes more flattering for over 50s - she 's added sleeves to shift dresses and cuts to accentuate a woman 's best assets			1
research reveals that the over 50 female fashion market in the @entity33 is currently worth £ 2.5 billion per season , and is the fastest growing fashion sector , so it is surprising that it is not better catered for			1
@entity94 plans : as well as editing a range for @entity13 , @entity7 has already started designing her @entity20 range for the brand and could n't be more excited confidence in fashion : @entity7 says that feeling comfortable in what you 're wearing is the most important thing when it comes to getting dressed in the morning ( left : blouse , £ 28 , right : blouse , £ 29 ) @entity7 mused : ' these women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic , it does n't matter what size or age they are , we have neglected them			1
i know this from my own experience , from talking to my mum and my viewers			0
the people that watch the show , i hope , will want to wear the clothes			0
' @entity7 said she had met many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish			1
' @entity126 is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that i 've chosen make me feel great , ' she said			0
speaking about the range , @entity132 , editor of @entity133 , said : ' @entity7 is a brilliant poster girl for enjoying fashion in your fifties , she ’s not afraid to experiment with colour and trends but sticks to classic and flattering shapes , which comes across in her first edit for the brand			1
' she has chosen wearable pieces with a bit of a fashion edge , e.g. dressing up a cosy poncho with leather leggings , proving that you do n’t need to try too hard to be stylish			0
no doubt this will encourage women stuck in a style rut to experiment a bit , and i ’m confident the range will fly			2

we want to look great , feel great and this is such an exciting opportunity for me			0
