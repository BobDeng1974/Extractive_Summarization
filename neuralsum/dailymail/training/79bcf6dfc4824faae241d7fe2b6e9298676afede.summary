it is a question to challenge some of the finest legal minds in the land : when is a cake not a cake , and a biscuit not a biscuit ? two judges solved it today by letting their taste buds decide – after testing a plateful of snowballs , a chocolate and coconut covered marshmallow treat that has been popular with the sweet - toothed masses for generations			1
verdict : snowballs are cakes			1
and that means the snack ’s manufacturers are in line for a £ 2.8million rebate from the taxman after a lengthy legal wrangle over whether snowballs should attract @entity27 ( which biscuits do ) or be zero - rated ( as a cake )			1
two brand - leading confectioner companies had each been ordered to pay the tax after @entity32 insisted snowballs do not enjoy the same exemption from @entity27 as tea cakes			1
cake or biscuit : the makers of the celebrated @entity39 ( being enjoyed by @entity40 ) will enjoy a £ 2.8m vat rebate after judges decided it was a cake - based on its taste , texture and when it 's eaten @entity46 ’s and @entity47 of @entity48 refused to accept that their bite - size classics - devoured in their millions each year by @entity51 - are ‘ standard - rated confectionery ’			1
so the sticky issue was decided instead by the might of a @entity55 - and the combined culinary wisdom of judges @entity57 and @entity59			1
at a hearing in @entity62 , they were presented with a plate of @entity64 , @entity66 tarts , tea cakes , @entity68 , @entity70 meringues and mini jam snow cakes as they deliberated			1
later they also sampled some @entity74 ’s snowballs			2
‘ we found that the plate looked like a plate of cakes , ’ judge @entity75 observed dryly			2
‘ we tasted all of them , in moderation , either at the hearing or thereafter			0
a @entity39 looks like a cake			2
it is not out of place on a plate full of cakes			0
a @entity39 has the mouth feel of a cake			0
everyone agreed that a @entity39 is certainly not a biscuit			0
’ comparison : the judges ate snowballs , bakewell tarts , teacakes and other sweet treats and said it had the characteristics of a cake not a biscuit through further explanation , it immediately became clear that the landmark decision was not reached without considerable research			1
‘ most people would want to enjoy a beverage of some sort whilst consuming a @entity39 , ’ she concluded			0
‘ it would often be eaten in a similar way and on similar occasions to cakes - for example to celebrate a birthday in an office			1
’ the tribunal was ‘ wholly agreed ’ that a @entity39 is a ‘ confection to be savoured but not whilst walking around or , for example , in the street ’			0
‘ most people would prefer to be sitting when eating a @entity39 and possibly , or preferably ... with a plate , a napkin or a piece of paper or even just a bare table so that the pieces of coconut which fly off do not create a great deal of mess			0
although by no means everyone considers a @entity39 to be a cake , we find that these facts , in particular , mean that a @entity39 has sufficient characteristics to be characterized as a cake			0
’ the ruling comes after a similar decision recently that @entity64 should be vat free			2
@entity47 and @entity139 both insisted their snowballs should also be exempt - and were appealing against a 2012 decision that rejected their claims for a £ 2.8million rebate			1
@entity146 , for the companies , contended that the titbit should be vat exempt			0
but @entity148 , for @entity32 , insisted the taxman should be allowed to take his bite			2
after digesting all the evidence , the tribunal ruled that the appeals should succeed .			0

court battle was between @entity139 and @entity47 and @entity32 over tax bill
judges decided on cake based on taste , texture and when they *'re* eaten
during deliberation they tried @entity64 , @entity66 tarts and meringues
snowballs will now enjoy the same exemption from @entity27 as tea cakes
