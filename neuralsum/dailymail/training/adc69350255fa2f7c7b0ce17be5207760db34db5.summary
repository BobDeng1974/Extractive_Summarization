by @entity0 the traditional @entity2 phoenix symbol suggests the perfect balance of yin and yang , and is a popular sign adorning everything from buildings to pottery across the eastern country			1
and now it has inspired the design of a pair of skyscrapers that , if built , will measure 3,280ft ( 1km ) tall			0
the @entity14 have been designed to be a soaring centre piece for the city of @entity17 - the capital of central @entity2 - and could become the world ’s tallest pair of skyscrapers as early as 2017			1
the @entity2 phoenix symbol of high virtue and balance has inspired the design of a pair of skyscrapers ( illustrated ) that if built , will measure 3,280ft ( 1km ) tall			1
the world 's tallest building is currently the @entity28 in @entity29 , at 2,722ft ( 829 metres ) the taller of the two towers will measure 3,280ft ( 1km ) if it is built			1
they are designed to be the centre piece for the city of @entity17 , the capital of central @entity2			1
' planets ' orbiting the towers could house themed restaurants an d ' insect hotels ' would be protect plants in the building from pests			1
the design was based on the @entity2 phoenix symbol ( pictured ) and balanced union			1
one tower will feed the other with renewable power and together they are intended to reduce pollution levels nearby			2
they include green walls , solar panels , biomass boilers , a thermal chimney and wind turbine , used to drive a giant kaleidoscope			0
the project is estimated to cost £ 1.2billion ( $ 2 billion ) with an estimated completion date of 2017			0
the world 's tallest building is currently the @entity28 in @entity29 , at 2,722ft ( 829 metres )			2
once completed , the @entity2 skyscrapers would be same height as the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity59 planned for 2018			0
as well as their collective incredible height , visitors to the city of @entity17 would also be able to see vast ‘ planets ’ orbiting the towers , as well as take in the world ’s tallest kaleidoscope			1
the imaginative design was dreamt up by @entity74 - based architects @entity72 for @entity17 ’s @entity75			2
the towers would cover seven hectares of a 47 hectare site , situated on an island in a lake , which is at the end of a 9,842ft ( 3km ) avenue within a dense city layout – a little like a futuristic @entity83			0
the city itself is known as the city of a thousand lakes			0
however , the building of the huge £ 1.2billion ( $ 2billion ) project depends on approval from the mayor of @entity17			0
if it goes ahead , the towers could be built within just three years			0
the towers ( illustrated ) will be packed with technology if they are built , and are designed to reduce the pollution levels in the city			2
the smaller of the towers has plant walls , insect hotels and biomass boilers , while the larger one is covered in photovoltaic panels to harvest solar energy			2
a kaleidoscope could be driven by a wind turbine the towers ( illustrated ) have been designed to be a soaring centre piece for the city of @entity17 - the capital of central @entity2 - and could become the world 's tallest pair of skyscrapers as early as 2017 the building of the £ 1.2billion ( $ 2billion ) project ( illustrated ) depends on approval from the mayor of @entity17 ‘ in response to the client 's wish to develop a new style of architecture that emphasises @entity2 identity , the use of a pair of towers reflects the dualist elements of @entity2 culture in contrast to a more western monolithic form , ’ the architects said			1
based on the traditional @entity2 phoenix symbol of two birds , male @entity132 and @entity133 , the plan was generated from the yin and yang form to represent perfectly balanced union			2
the @entity132 tower uses cutting - edge technology to ' feed ' the @entity133 tower with renewable power in a symbiotic process			0
among the technological features planned for the structure are ways to recycle and clean water and air , in a bid to reduce local pollution levels			1
in the design , there are three large spheres suspended between the two skyscrapers , which represent ' planets ' orbiting the towers			0
these are set to house restaurants that will have a celestial theme and are accessed via ' skywalks ' from the towers themselves			0
the main tower would accommodate the world 's tallest kaleidoscope , driven by a wind turbine at a high level to create a colourful display when viewed from below			1
chetwoods said the project would showcase social , economic and environmental sustainability in @entity2 if it gets the go - ahead			0
the @entity14 have been designed to be a soaring centre piece for the city of @entity17 - the capital of central @entity2 , which is an incredibly densely populated city the towers could cover seven hectares of a 47 hectare site , situated on an island in a lake , which is at the end of a 9,842ft ( 3km ) avenue within a dense city layout - a little like a futuristic @entity83			1

towers are intended for the city of @entity17 - the capital of central @entity2
they could be built as early as 2017 , if the design is approved
design is based on the @entity2 phoenix symbol , demonstrating balance
skyscrapers would feature the world 's tallest kaleidoscope and vast ' planets ' orbiting the towers to house themed restaurants
they would also include tech to clean water and air , in a bid to reduce local pollution levels , and ' insect hotels ' to keep plants free from pests
