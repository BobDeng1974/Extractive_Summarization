by @entity0 published : 15:39 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 21:04 est , 29 october 2012 pressing ahead : @entity1 has said he will axe legal quotas of school fields for team sports @entity1 yesterday vowed to press ahead with rule changes that could see hundreds of schools sell off their playing fields			1
the @entity8 remained defiant over his plans to scrap regulations setting out the minimum space schools must provide for team games , facing down critics by telling them they were simply wrong			0
opponents say the rule change - due to come into force tomorrow - will make it easier for schools to justify cutting back the size of their playing fields			1
since details of the move were first revealed as @entity23 celebrated @entity25 success , an online petition has attracted more than 150,000 signatures demanding a rethink			2
challenging mr @entity1 in the @entity28 yesterday , @entity29 , @entity30 mp for @entity31 , said : ' considering the need to preserve our @entity25 legacy , what does the secretary of state have to say to those 150,000 people who signed a petition against his plans which will come into force this wednesday to scrap minimum size regulations for school playing fields ? ' mr @entity1 replied : ' i admire their passion , but they are wrong			1
' under the current rules , schools must provide between 2,500 and 75,000 square metres of space for team games depending on the number of pupils they educate			2
in future , they will merely be required to provide ' suitable outdoor space ' for physical education and play			0
the current detailed table of minimum space requirements will be rewritten and simplified but will be laid down in non-binding guidance rather than law			0
the @entity64 says the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly and cheaply to accommodate a surge in the birth rate			0
officials also say that schools will find the new rules easier to follow because bureaucratic restrictions have been removed , allowing heads to decide what is best for their pupils			2
but @entity30 claims the move could lead to ' salami slicing ' of school pitches			1
an @entity79 tabled in the @entity30 leader @entity80 to demand the scrapping of the new regulations has been signed so far by more than a dozen mps			0
opposition : 150,000 people have signed a petition and shadow education secretary @entity84 commented on the importance of having good sports facilities @entity90 education secretary @entity84 said : ' we need our schools to have the best possible sports facilities so that we encourage a new generation of @entity25 athletes , and healthy and active young people			2
' by telling schools they no longer need proper playing fields the government is letting down our young people			1
' @entity30 believes all pupils should have access to playing fields , regardless of where they go to school			1
@entity107 said he wanted to ' spread privilege ' in education - he should show he means it by reversing this decision before even more damage to school sport is done			0
' if @entity107 believes in school sport he should back @entity30 's motion to protect school playing fields			1
' but the @entity64 defended the move			0
a spokesman said : ' for the first time these regulations require all schools to provide space for all the activities in their @entity125 curriculum and for outdoor play			0
' we have made the rules much easier for schools to follow by removing bureaucratic restrictions and freeing schools up to decide what is best for their pupils			2
' minimum requirements : in the future , schools will merely be required to provide ' suitable outdoor space ' for physical education and play he said that previous rules on playing fields favoured outdoor team sports , with no requirement for schools to have space for activities in the curriculum or for play time			1
the @entity150 has come under intense pressure over its strategy for creating an @entity25 legacy through schools			1
it faced criticism for scrapping a scheme aimed at building links between schools and clubs and reducing the amount of ring - fenced cash for school sport			0
its record on the sale of school pitches also came under fire with revelations that more than 30 had been sold off since 2010 despite a pledge to protect them in the @entity150 agreement			1
some decisions to allow sales had been taken against the advice of a panel of experts			0
the government has also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of @entity125 a week .			0
