by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:44 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:27 est , 17 february 2014 residents of @entity5 were left feeling rattled over the weekend after a strong of some 20 earthquakes as powerful as 3.5 magnitude rocked the central part of the state on saturday alone			1
areas north of @entity12 felt the brunt of the temblors , which some say were accompanied by startling booms like the sound of an explosion			1
the mystery earthquake wave now has residents fearing for their personal safety and the security of their property			1
meanwhile , scientists have been left scratching their heads over the quakes , which are becoming more frequent each day			1
quake cluster : a map created by @entity29 shows the massive cluster of 20 - plus quakes that have shaken central @entity5 in recent days ' felt like bombs going off			1
it 's just a huge loud noise and then it 's like a reverb from that boom that just shakes the entire house , ' @entity34 resident @entity33 told @entity40			1
@entity41 was one of countless @entity43 startled by the quakes , which included a 3.5 magnitude shakeup in the @entity47 area			1
' if i 'm experiencing eight of these in one day , ' @entity41 wondered , ' then when does it erupt and become absolutely horrible that takes my house down ? ' unfortunately , scientists do n't yet have an answer			0
' we have a lot of pre-existing faults in @entity5 , ' seismologist @entity56 told @entity40			0
however , with little history of seismic activity in the area , it 's unclear why the quakes would become so frequent now			1
another potential cause is the change in water levels at nearby @entity68 , where a swarm of the earthquakes were centered saturday			1
the controversial hydraulic fracturing or ' fracking ' method pumping millions of gallons of water , sand and chemicals into fractures in the @entity79			2
why now ? a chart compiled by the @entity1 from @entity82 data shows the huge spike in @entity5 earthquakes after 2009			0
scientists point to many possible explanations , including controversial ' fracking ' boom ! the largest of the earthquakes was a 3.5 magnitude temblor near the town of @entity92			1
most people can feel a quake above a magnitude of 3 and many residents said saturday 's quakes were accompanied by massive , explosion - like booms ' we 've looked at hydraulic fracturing , ' said @entity56 , but scientists have yet to blame it -- or anything -- for the quake swarm			1
what is sure is that the quakes are growing in frequency			0
from 1975 to 2008 , only a handful of magnitude - 3.0 earthquakes or greater occurred yearly in @entity5			0
but the average grew to around 40 annual earthquakes from 2009 to 2013 , seismologists said in an october study by the @entity82 on the uptick of quake activity			0
since 2009 , more than 200 magnitude - 3.0 or greater earthquakes have hit the state 's midsection , according to the @entity82			2
many have been centered near @entity12 , the most populous part of the state			2
some researchers and environmental groups have long suspected fracking can have seismic repercussions because it forces millions of gallons of water , sand and other materials deep underground to free pockets of fossil fuels			2
the energy industry has repeatedly insisted that the practice is safe			0
scientists researching the theory say it 's not clear yet whether fracking can trigger significant quakes			1
@entity5 's strongest recorded earthquake was a 5.6 - magnitude surprise that struck in november 2011 near the town of @entity143			2
it damaged 200 buildings , shook a football stadium and rattled parts of seven states			0
no one has been killed or seriously injured in the recent quakes , and property damage has been minimal			2
but the frequent tremors have been enough to weaken the constitution of even the most weather - hardened @entity43			0
the earthquakes rumbled @entity34 near @entity12 late sunday , about a week after a 4.1 magnitude temblor caused minor damage at the county jail in @entity159			1
the @entity82 says a 3.8 - magnitude earthquake struck shortly before 11 p.m. sunday			0
the @entity82 initially estimated the earthquake as a 4.2 magnitude , but it was later downgraded to a 3.8 magnitude			0
the earthquake was centered about 7 miles south - southwest of @entity159			0
@entity159 is about 30 miles north of @entity12			2
another earthquake with a 2.9 magnitude was recorded about 30 minutes later followed shortly by a third earthquake with a 3.0 magnitude			0
no damage has been reported			0
damages : @entity34 resident @entity33 pointed out the cracks that appeared in her newly built @entity5 home following the quake swarm scary experience : @entity41 also described the huge boom sounds that came with the quakes and the cracks in her new home 's walls			1

an area of @entity34 around @entity12 felt the brunt of the quakes , which were as large as magnitude 3.5
residents feared for their personal safety and for their property but scientists remain *unsure* what 's causing them , much less how to *predict* or stop them
scientists say it could be the result of fracking , changes in lake water levels or even a natural occurrence
