adding pressure to fix the administration 's problem - plagued health care program , former president @entity0 says president @entity4 should find a way to let people keep their health coverage , even if it means changing the law			1
@entity0 says @entity4 should ' honor the commitment that the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got '			1
the former president , a @entity15 who has helped @entity4 promote the three - year - old health law , becomes the latest in @entity4 's party to urge the president to live up to a promise he made repeatedly , declaring that the if @entity20 liked their health care coverage , they would be able to keep it under the new law			1
that , coupled with the troubled launch of the health care law 's enrollment website , has prompted @entity35 critics and frustrated @entity36 to seek corrections in the law			2
