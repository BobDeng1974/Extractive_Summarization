by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 with @entity4 's move to @entity5 completed , @entity2 could be set to take on the mantle of @entity8 's famous number seven shirt			1
but the question now is whether he can emulate @entity4 and earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as others who have worn @entity8 's iconic number seven			1
the @entity15 , for all his unsavoury antics , produced some phenomenal performances for @entity8 , culminating in his @entity18 awards last season			2
@entity35 was signed in 1971 , and formed a lethal strike partnership with @entity41 before moving to @entity42 in 1977			0
in his six years at the club @entity43 won the league three times , scored over 100 goals , and led @entity8 to the @entity47			2
his first goal came 12 minutes into his debut			0
his last match sealed the @entity52 title for the club			0
for the early 1970s he was the iconic leader of @entity8 's line and still considered by many to be their greatest striker			1
@entity35 would go on to be the first @entity58 winner of the @entity59 since @entity60 , receiving the award in 1978 and ' 79			0
celebration : @entity35 scored over 100 times in his six seasons with @entity8 , the first great number seven champion : @entity35 ( centre ) celebrates winning the @entity47 in his final game with boss @entity69 ( right ) @entity70 1977 - 1987 filling the hole left behind by @entity35 's move to @entity42 was never going to be easy , but @entity70 's arrival from @entity74 did just that			1
possibly @entity8 's greatest ever player , @entity70 played over 500 times for the club scoring 169 goals			1
at the end of his first season with the club @entity70 scored the only goal in the @entity47 final , and his decade playing for the club produced six league titles			2
as both a player and a manager @entity70 was a @entity8 hero , and ensured the legend of the number seven lived on			1
@entity70 : during his time as a player and a manager @entity8 won nine league titles legend : @entity70 holds aloft the trophy after winning yet another championship with the club @entity99 1987 - 1991 a similar type of player to @entity70 , although rarely mentioned with the same expressions of awe by @entity8 fans			1
two titles in his four years at the club was an excellent return , and his first season on @entity110 saw him play an important part in one of the great @entity8 sides			2
title winner : @entity99 ( right ) celebrates the 1990 title , @entity8 's last , with @entity116 another great goal : @entity35 fires in a low strike for @entity8 against rivals @entity119 he was denied the @entity52 glory of his predecessors by the ban on @entity58 clubs from @entity52 football , but @entity99 deserves to be remembered as part of the number 7 tradition			1
@entity127 1990 - 1999 the only man on this list to have come through the @entity8 youth system to wear the number seven shirt , @entity128 was a key member of the squad throughout the 1990s			1
while he may not match the likes of @entity35 and @entity70 in terms of trophies , @entity127 provided pace and flair in a team far below the standard of the previous decades			2
dribbler : @entity127 brought flair to the declining @entity8 side of the 1990s his successes for @entity8 , more often as a provider than a goalscorer , earned a move to @entity148 the winger was never really able to throw off his ' @entity151 ' tag as the @entity8 team in the mid- 90s grew a reputation for the wrong reasons , but on the pitch he was a star for the right reasons			0
goals and assists were plentiful , and earned him a move to @entity148 , where he scored in the 2000 @entity47 final			0
his 142 assists in his nine years for @entity8 remains a remarkable statistic , and he was always more the supplier than the goalscorer			0
gone : @entity4 has completed his Â£ 75m move to @entity5 after a superb season for @entity8 1971 - 1977 @entity180 - 1987 @entity179 - 1989 @entity178 - 1989 @entity177 - 1991 @entity176 @entity175 - 1992 @entity174 - 1996 @entity173 - 1999 @entity172 - 2005 @entity171 - 2008 @entity170 - 2009 @entity169 - 2010 @entity168 - @entity2 @entity4 2011 - 2014 the first player in @entity183 history to claim three hat - tricks against the same club when he scored a treble against @entity187 in december 2013 , @entity4 has come the closest to making the duo of @entity35 and @entity70 a trinity			1
the previous wearers of the red cloth did not provoke anywhere near the controversy that has followed the forward around			0
racist abuse , the biting incidents and the on - off transfer saga have all added spice to the story			0
now that he has departed to @entity5 , his time at @entity8 can be fully evaluated			0
free - kicks that fizz into the net , little chips over the goalkeeper ... for the neutral it has been a privilege to witness - on the pitch at least			0
the only thing is , @entity209 and @entity70 carry the mantle of greatness because of a level of brilliance that was sustained over a number of years			2
happier times : @entity4 propelled @entity8 to within touching distance of their first @entity183 title controversy : @entity4 's antics , and his relatively short spell , mean he will not be remembered as the greatest number seven , but on the pitch he earned the right to be mentioned alongside @entity35 and @entity70 @entity224 : @entity4 's performances last season led to comparisons with @entity228 and @entity229 that longevity is something that the most recent incumbent chose not to replicate			1
his move means that @entity4 will never achieve the long - term success of those two greats , but his contribution since 2011 suggests he is certainly able to be mentioned in the same breath			0
and , given the achievements and contribution made by both @entity35 and @entity70 , that 's surely high praise indeed .			1

@entity2 likely to be @entity8 's new number seven shirt
number is iconic in the club 's history
