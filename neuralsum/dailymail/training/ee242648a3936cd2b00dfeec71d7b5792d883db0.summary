@entity5 and @entity6 , @entity7 , are being put through their paces in haute ecole — an equestrian discipline not seen in this country for 300 years			1
haute ecole ( high school ) is equine ballet			1
a horse undertakes an extraordinary series of choreographed leaps , kicks and canters known as ‘ airs above the ground ’			0
after more than 300 years the art of historic classical horse dressage ' @entity26 ' is performed at @entity27 , @entity23 previously owned by @entity28 the levade move was first taught at the beginning of the 20th century , asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30 - 35 degrees from the ground in a spectacle as breathtaking as it is beautiful , these magnificent horses perform the complex dance - like steps in an equine equivalent of ballet			0
the white ‘ pillar ’ in the centre of the riding school is used to encourage the animals to move in ever - decreasing circles			0
the horses in these photographs – @entity5 and @entity47 – are @entity7 , one of the few breeds with the physical strength and intelligence to master the discipline			1
rider @entity52 , 19 , with @entity5 ' a 14 - year - old @entity7 @entity54 horse performing in the castle 's original riding room advanced dressage training techniques were introduced to @entity58 in the 17th century by @entity59 , first @entity60 , once riding master to @entity62 they are pictured performing at @entity27 in @entity23 , once the seat of @entity28 , and now the only @entity66 venue for ‘ haute ecole ’			1
rider @entity52 , 19 , instructs six - year - old @entity47 to perform moves such as a ' @entity68 ' , where all four of the horses legs are off the ground at once			0
the discipline was once said to have originated on the battlefields of the seventeenth century when cavalrymen needed to carefully manoeuvre their mounts among foot soldiers but historians now believe it is more likely that it developed from exercises used to strengthen horses for combat			2
three hundred years ago the @entity66 were world leaders at the sport			2
‘ haute ecole ’ was introduced to this country by @entity59 , first @entity60 and riding master to @entity62 however , after the art was perfected it died out in @entity66 , with the @entity7 and @entity89 now reigning supreme			1

the sport of dressage proved a big hit at the @entity104 where @entity105 won a total of five medals			0
@entity108 mesmerised the nation with her performances of routines on her horse @entity113 , winning gold in the team dressage and individual dressage events			0
her sequence featuring @entity118 , @entity119 and the chimes of @entity121 proved a big hit with the judges and raised the profile of dressage as a sport among the @entity66 people			2
last year was the first time @entity66 had ever won a medal in an @entity99 dressage event			0
equine ballerina : the capriole ( left ) where all four hooves are off the ground and the pessade ( right ) where the horse stands on hind legs , are important parts of the dance a post is placed in the middle of the room and the horse is led in ever - decreasing circles as part of their training in equine ballet known as haute ecole pretty pony : the horses taking part in haute ecole must look the part as well as being trained to perform complex choreography @entity156 century sport : this illustration of a horse performing a capriole , where all four legs are off the ground dates back to 1650 with @entity164 castle in the background the original riding room at @entity27 in @entity23 ( shown in this illustration ) is once again being used for haute ecole 300 years on			1
