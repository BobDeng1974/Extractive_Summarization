the @entity0 has declared a willingness to stage international football matches at @entity3 if a decision is taken to quit @entity5			1
the @entity7 ’s current lease on the national stadium in mount @entity9 expires in 2020			2
speaking last summer , @entity7 chief executive @entity10 admitted they had to ‘ explore all options ’ but stressed that @entity5 remained a ‘ key pillar ’ of football in this country			1
@entity0 has declared a willingness to stage international football matches at @entity3 work will be done on the stadium prior to it hosting @entity22 matches but there remains a question mark over whether a wider — and more costly — revamp will be undertaken			1
it is possible @entity7 games could instead be taken on the road around various venues after 2020 , with @entity0 chief executive @entity30 now offering the use of the 67,000 - capacity @entity3			1
the home of @entity34 rugby hosted two of @entity38 ’s @entity37 qualifiers while @entity39 was on @entity41 duty last summer			0
@entity30 is keen to trim the @entity0 ’s £ 11million debt and potentially gaining rental income from the @entity7 carries significant financial attraction			1
the @entity3 pitch has recently been replaced by a £ 1.25m hybrid surface ‘ we hosted @entity38 when they could n’t use their own ground during the @entity41 , so we ’re open to the idea of football being played here , ’ said @entity30			0
‘ we have n’t had any official conversations with the @entity7 but clearly if there is a desire from them to come and play at @entity3 then we would happily listen to whatever proposal they put forward			1
‘ i do think the issue in @entity7 is that we have got too many big stadiums and not enough small ones			0
‘ so it is difficult to make all of the bigger ones financially viable			0
‘ if you have any kind of stadium — indoor or outdoor — it is the number of dark nights that are the problem and you need to use it as much as you possibly can			0
the @entity7 are exploring all options with regard to hosting of @entity7 matches ‘ something like @entity76 is such an expensive building to maintain so to have it empty is not what you want			2
so we ’re always thinking of ways to improve the @entity3 estate so it becomes a better and more viable financial option for us			0
’ the @entity7 declined to comment but there would likely be significant resistance from within @entity34 football to any thought of money flowing out to rugby			0
a consultancy firm has been engaged by the @entity7 to fully evaluate a number of options in relation to their future at @entity5 , but that process remains in its early stages with five years still to go on the existing lease .			2
