by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 16 december 2012 radical preacher @entity1 has moved into a new taxpayer - funded house worth £ 450,000 near to a church – and the furious owner wants him out			1
the fanatical muslim , who preached hate sermons towards the @entity8 – arrived in the leafy suburb of @entity10 last week			2
he had left his previous £ 400,000 four - bedroom rented home near @entity13 after apparently complaining it was too small for him and his family			1
similar homes in the area have sold for close to £ 500,000			1
but the woman who owns the smart four - bedroom house reacted angrily last night after discovering the identity of her new tenant – and said she would try to evict him			1
she said she was ' astonished ' to be told the radical cleric had been allowed to live in the property , which she rents out through an agency for £ 1,400 a month			1
speaking from her home , the owner said : ' i had no idea who was living there			1
i have read about this man and why he was in prison , he does not seem like a nice character			2
' a family member was living at the house until they recently passed away			2
now we are letting it out via a local estate agent – who told me they would most probably let it to a member of their staff			2
' we signed a contract with the company for six months but there is no way i would have given my permission to rent the house to a man like that – not ever			2
a satellite dish is removed from the hate preacher 's old home ' it is a very smart house with a nice garden and we hoped someone decent would be able to enjoy being there			1
this has left me very unhappy			0
' the owner yesterday contacted the estate agent to demand an explanation – but the company claimed that they did not know who was renting the house as they had in turn sub-let it			2
' we are hoping to have a meeting on monday to find out what is going on , we are very unhappy and i told the agents they have to sort this situation immediately , ' she added			0
' i do not want this man in my house and we will be taking steps to remove him if we can			0
' it comes as the government revealed the hate preacher has so far received more than half a million pounds in legal aid			1
in a parliamentary answer @entity96 , under - secretary of state at the @entity95 , confirmed that as of december 5 the @entity98 had provided £ 515,778 in funding			2
justice secretary @entity100 said : ' we must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer			1
the total costs in some cases seem very high and many - myself included - will question whether they provide value for money			0
' i am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system			1
i have ordered an immediate examination of aspects of the system that affect its credibility with the public			0
' legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system , but resources are n't limitless			1
legal aid should be reserved for cases where there is genuine need			1
' removal men were seen outside the radical cleric 's north - @entity10 home , loading possessions , including a large satellite dish and what looked like a personal cross-trainer , into a van @entity132 also reacted angrily to @entity134 's move yesterday as it emerged that two security cameras had been installed above lampposts opposite the house			1
one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' i had no idea who was living there			0
an old lady used to live there and she was always very polite and no bother at all			0
' this is a nice area where people say hello to each other			0
but i ca n't imagine many people around here being too happy at having a terror suspect living next door			0
' another neighbour said : ' two men spent an afternoon erecting two security cameras opposite my house			0
when we asked them what was going on they told us to call the police			0
' but even now , when there are plain - clothed police outside our house , no one will tell us anything			0
' it just is n't right we should have this stress brought to our doorstep			0
this is a very nice area for hard working , law - abiding people			0
' however , the vicar at the church said : ' absolutely anyone is welcome to our church and i would encourage mr @entity1 and his family to join in our @entity177 celebrations and reach out to the local community – especially at this time of year			0
' yesterday two plain - clothed police officers kept watch on the house in an unmarked car			0
a woman , believed to be a @entity185 employee , visited the new @entity134 residence at 10.30am and stayed for two hours			1
@entity134 was pictured wearing traditional @entity188 robes as he left his former house in @entity10 last monday			1
removal men were seen loading possessions , including a large satellite dish , into a van before driving off			0
@entity134 , 52 , who has been described as @entity197 's right - hand man in @entity198 , remains on bail in @entity10			1
home secretary @entity200 lost the latest round in her battle to deport him to @entity204 , where he is accused of being involved in bomb plots against foreigners .			2

the owner of his new rented home said she will try to evict him
government confirm @entity134 has so far received more than £ 500,000 in legal aid
