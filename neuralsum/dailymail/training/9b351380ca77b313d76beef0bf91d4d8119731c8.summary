three men have been jailed for raping a 23 - year - old woman who admitted she could not remember if she had consented to sex or not			1
@entity3 , 49 , former soldier @entity4 , 44 , and @entity5 , 40 , raped the woman at a flat in @entity8 in 2012			1
they were imprisoned for six years each despite judge @entity10 , who jailed the men at @entity12 , attempting to halt the trial halfway through because of a lack of evidence			1
@entity3 ( left ) , 49 , former soldier @entity4 ( centre ) , 44 , and @entity5 ( right ) , 40 , raped the woman at a flat in @entity8 in 2012 subjecting her to a 20 - hour ordeal the issue central to the prosecution case was that the victim lacked the capacity to consent to the sexual activity			1
the victim , who had been drinking with friends , was taken by the men in a taxi to the flat when she was subjected to a 20 hour ordeal			1
the trial , which began on january 5 , was suspended for a number of days when the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to put before a jury on the basis that a lack of memory does not amount to a lack of capacity to consent			1
judge @entity41 told the court at the time : ' i 've found this case extremely interesting and extremely difficult			2
' in my judgment there is insufficient evidence from which the jury could determine lack of capacity and i will withdraw the case from the jury			1
' he added : ' we are left in the position that there is no evidence from which the jury could say she lacked capacity as opposed to simply having no recollection of events which may have been consented to			2
' this is a uniquely difficult situation where , as opposed to ( the case which is one of the leading legal authorities on these issues ) there is a total absence of any evidence as to consent			1
' i do not want this ruling to be misunderstood - i am absolutely not saying that a woman in drink can not say no. ' i am not saying that lack of memory equals consent			1
' but in an unusual move , the prosecution sought a ruling from the @entity78 , arguing that the full context needed to be taken into consideration when considering the issue of consent			1
this included mobile phone footage taken by one of the defendants and blood tests showing a high level of alcohol in the victim 's blood			0
the @entity78 ruled in favour of the prosecution and so the trial continued			1
the jury went on to convict the three men earlier this week			2
judge @entity10 ( pictured ) halted the trial at @entity12 saying it could not be proved the woman did not have the capacity to consent judge @entity41 made no reference to the @entity78 intervention when he sentenced the three men at court yesterday			1
he described how the woman had already had a lot to drink when she was picked up by three men , including two of the defendants , outside a @entity8 nightclub in october 2012 and taken to a party			1
the judge said the woman consumed more alcohol at the party where she had sex with each of the three men in turn			1
her sexual activity with @entity4 was filmed on a phone			1
judge @entity41 said she was ' used as a shared commodity ' by the defendants			2
he told them : ' all three of you had sex with her when she was so intoxicated she was helpless			0
' she had lost the capacity to evaluate , discriminate and make meaningful choices			0
she had no capacity to consent			0
you all had no reasonable belief she was consenting			0
' the court was told divorced father - of - two @entity4 served with distinction in the @entity132 for 10 years , including in the first @entity133			1
@entity5 and @entity134 are both @entity136 nationals who came to the @entity137 to work			1
@entity3 is a father - of - three and forklift truck driver @entity5 is a father - of - two			1
after the case , the victim said : ' i 'm just glad it 's over now			0
' she said the judge 's decision to halt the trial and the subsequent appeal worried her and her family			1
she said : ' i thought it was all over			0
i was very upset , the whole family were			0
and we were n't allowed to know exactly what was going on			0
' they knew the evidence they had			2
they could have made that decision already , before getting to that point			2
' the trial heard how the victim had never met any of the men before that night and all the defendants told police they had consensual sex with her at the party			1
the jury was told the woman left the nightclub at about 2.10am after drinking around 12 shots of vodka			1
she went to the flat , where the three defendants were drinking vodka with at least four other men , and did not leave until 11pm that night			1
when she complained to the police later , a blood sample was taken from her			0
a toxicologist gave expert evidence at the trial , saying that at the time the victim was leaving the club she would have had a concentration of between 108 and 238 milligrams per 100 mls of blood with the most likely concentration 173			1
the drink driving limit is 80			0
@entity4 , @entity3 and @entity5 were convicted of rape and jailed for a total of 18 years at @entity12 ( pictured ) after the @entity191 appealed the judge 's decision in a statement read to the court , the victim described how the ordeal had left her unable to form relationships and suffering from panic attacks			1
the statement issued through @entity201 said : ' this has taken a long time - two years and three months from when this happened to the conclusion of the court case			1
' i would like to say thank you to the teams who helped me - the police , gps , health professionals and counsellors , among others			2
not one person has made a judgement and they have been incredibly supportive			0
' after this happened i went on anti-depressants , i got panic attacks , i did n't have a relationship for over a year because i had trouble with trust and intimacy			2
it was all very stressful , as was the court case			0
' the sentence for each of these men is a good one , i am pleased with it , and it 's a bit more than i thought they might get			2
' i 'll never forget what happened but i will move on			0
i 'm now in a steady and happy relationship and looking to the future			0
i would n't have got through any of this without the help , love and support of my family and friends			0
' i 'd like to say to everyone that if you ever find yourself in the position that the men involved in this did that you should really think about what you 're doing and make sure you know the person you 're with is fully aware of what they are doing			2
being drunk is not an excuse			0
' to any girl who has been in my situation - if something has happened and you think that something is n't right then talk to people , the authorities or family and friends and hopefully they can help			2
' it would be nice if something good came out of all of this and it could help someone else			0
' the @entity191 ( @entity191 ) said the victim was subjected to ' a protracted attack ' which ' lasted 20 hours '			0
@entity271 , cps @entity272 senior district crown prosecutor , said : ' this was rape as it was clear the woman was in no state to consent to sex			2
' while it is , of course , true that lack of memory , on its own , does not prove lack of consent , the context in this case showed that this victim was taken advantage of because she was incapacitated , and that she could not have consented to sexual activity			1
' it is against the law to engage in sexual activity with someone who is clearly unable , through drink , to give their consent			0
we are pleased that the @entity78 ruled in the way it did and the case proceeded to the jury for a verdict			2
' the victim in this case has shown tremendous courage in this case			0
she suffered an horrific ordeal because of the actions of these three men and we are satisfied to see justice has been served			2
' detective inspector @entity307 said : ' capacity and consent have been at the very heart of this case			0
the victim was in no way able to consent to engaging in any kind of sexual activity with these men , she was vulnerable and incapable of giving any kind of consent			0
' we hope this serves as a warning and reminder to everyone that before engaging in any kind of sexual activity you must be absolutely sure that the other person has the capacity to fully consent and does so			0
' i would like to pay tribute to the victim in this case			0
she has shown immense courage ; from giving live evidence in court to seeing this case through to the end			0
we are grateful to her for her help and hope today 's sentences offer some closure so that she can really begin rebuilding her life			0
