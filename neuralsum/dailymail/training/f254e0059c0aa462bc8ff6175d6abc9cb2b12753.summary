@entity0 emerges from a side door of his home in the @entity4 countryside cradling baby daughter @entity5 , as two - year - old son @entity6 searches the kitchen for a tape measure to record the height of the breakfast bar			1
if anyone can be presented as proof of the existence of the ‘ nappy factor ’ — a term introduced by betting guru @entity16 to suggest having babies , particularly boys , makes a better golfer — it is @entity0			1
‘ it ’s played a big part			2
i did n’t win a tournament until i had a child and now i ’ve won three so i suppose i ’d better have some more kids , ’ he says			2
‘ i did n’t want them to grow up saying : “ my dad was a professional golfer but he did n’t win any tournaments ”			1
’ @entity0 at home in @entity4 with his family , wife @entity32 son @entity6 and daughter @entity28 @entity0 secured his @entity34 place by winning the penultimate counting event , the @entity37 masters it was no coincidence , thinks @entity0 , that his breakthrough tour victory at the @entity40 in 2012 , after trying for 12 years and 255 events , came just three months after @entity6 ’s birth			1
on thursday , @entity0 will tee it up in the @entity44 but next week he makes his debut for @entity46 in the @entity34			1
his rise has been called a ‘ @entity48 ’			2
over the past five years he has advanced from a top - 100 performer into one of @entity46 ’s best , securing a place at @entity52 by right			2
not bad for a man who has been forced to contemplate ‘ getting a proper job ’ on several occasions due to a back injury he believes was caused by practising too much			2
‘ it got so bad i was scared of bending down to pick up my ball , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ if i trod on a pothole in the course i thought that would be it			2
every other week i ’d be having a problem , it was horrific , i thought i was finished			0
’ in 2006 , he found himself plying his wares in the backwaters of the @entity68			0
in stark contrast to the £ 2million he has earned this year in prize - money , @entity0 was scraping by			1
‘ i was in the wilderness , ’ he says , ‘ not really earning enough to keep myself , let alone a family			2
that was the biggest eye - opener for me			0
after two events on the @entity68 i was staring in the face getting a real job and i really did n’t like that prospect			0
@entity0 poses for a photograph with his family ahead of the @entity34 campaign @entity0 's rise is proof at the existence of a ' nappy factor ' ‘ i was playing rubbish and stayed in terrible @entity85 , accommodation that was n’t clean			1
but my attitude was that providing you ’ve got a bed to sleep on and it ’s not too cold , it did n’t matter			0
i do n’t mind roughing it			0
when i was a kid we used to go to watch @entity92 and sleep in the back of a @entity95 where it was @entity97 at night just to see @entity98 or @entity99 play			0
’ we are sitting in a house — designed by @entity0 ’s wife @entity32 , an international business and @entity103 graduate — which overlooks rolling farmland			1
smart but not flash , it is just outside the upmarket village of @entity108			0
@entity109 lives round the corner , @entity111 in the next village			2
the material gains are clear to see but they have not come without hard work			0
success on the biggest stage has come relatively late to @entity0			1
at 38 , he is the fourth oldest on @entity46 ’s @entity34 team but one of only three who have not played in it before			1
‘ i still consider myself young in golfing terms because i started late , ’ he says			0
where @entity121 was celebrated on the front of golf magazines at five and @entity125 was hitting 40 - yard drives aged two , @entity0 did not play properly until he was 12 and was arguably not even the best in his own family			1
@entity0 plays a shot during the third round of the @entity130 at @entity132 - @entity131 @entity0 will tee it up in the @entity44 but next week he makes his debut for @entity46 ‘ i have a bit of banter with my brother , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he won the junior matchplay at our club in @entity141 and i never did			0
‘ i ’m a massive @entity143 fan and played football until i was 15 but decided i wanted to be a pro golfer and i ’d practise until the cows came home			2
i ’d hit down the fairways of the par - fiv			0
members would hit their balls between yours and you ’d have 100 balls in the same place			2
they hated it but i ’d do it all day			0
‘ i used to practise on my own			0
when you leave school at 16 without qualifications you ’d better like practising on your own because if you do n’t , you ’re toast			0
’ @entity160 was born in @entity161 to a @entity163 mother and @entity165 father , @entity164 , who acted as a taxi driver in the early days			0
‘ he ’d drive me the length of the country to tournaments and lessons , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he used to caddie for me but i sacked him			0
i duffed a chip and he said , “ what you done that for ? ” and i said , “ @entity175 , how far ’s the clubhouse ? ” it was about a mile , so i said , “ see you then ”			0
’ it was hard to get @entity0 off the practice ground , but he is barely on it now and has not been to the gym since 2007			1
he stays fit by mountain and road biking			0
@entity0 has not been to a gym since 2007 and stays fit by mountain and road biking @entity0 ’s wife , @entity32 , an international business and @entity103 graduate ‘ my body feels as strong as it ever has , ’ he says			1
occasionally , @entity0 thinks about what it will feel like to be on the first tee at @entity52			1
@entity194 said it is the most nervous you feel as a golfer			2
‘ the more nervous you are , the better you play sometimes , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ in the last round at the @entity40 i hit the best shot i ever had off the first tee and never looked back			1
it is a dream come true to play in the @entity34 , but there ’s still plenty of fuel in the fire			1
i ’m not thinking that ’ll be me all out			0
i ’m thinking it ’s a stepping stone			0

@entity0 lives in @entity4 with his family , wife @entity208 and daughter @entity28
the @entity212 secured his @entity34 place by winning the penultimate counting event
the golfer 's rise is proof at the existence of a ' nappy factor '
