by @entity0 you might be under the impression that losing weight requires you to spend hours slogging away in the gym			0
but according to scientists , just one extra minute of brisk activity every day can help burn off unwanted pounds			1
researchers monitored the activity of 4,500 adults , and discovered that how often you exercise your heart and lungs matters more than the duration of the workout			1
they found that several short bursts of exertion had the same effect as longer , but less frequent spells of exercise			1
scientists have suggested shorter bursts of exercise can be more effective than long gym sessions those short bursts could include taking the stairs instead of the lift , parking further away from the shops and walking , or getting off the bus one stop early			1
lead researcher dr @entity32 , from the @entity33 , said : ‘ what we learned is that for preventing weight gain , the intensity of the activity matters more than duration			0
‘ knowing that even short bouts of brisk activity can add up to a positive effect is really an encouraging message for promoting better health			1
’ in the study , volunteers wore accelerometers – devices which can accurately measure movement and activity			0
participants also had their body mass index ( @entity53 ) recorded			0
this measures weight in relation to height			0
researchers found that , for women , every minute spent in higher - intensity short bouts of activity each day was associated with a @entity53 reduction of 0.07			2
the results showed that one minute of brisk activity each day offset the calorie equivalent of 0.41lb in weight			0
the scientists explained that this means if a 5ft 5in woman regularly took the stairs at work , she would weigh nearly half a pound less than a woman of the same height who took the lift			1
the results were similar for men			0
scientists say that taking the stairs instead of using lifts can help shift up to half a pound of weight each daily minute of higher - intensity activity lowered the likelihood of being obese by 2 per cent for men and 5 per cent for women			1
but the study found that , on average , the women who were having their movements monitored were less physically active than the men			0
the report , which was published in the @entity92 , said : ‘ taking the stairs , walking to the store or between errands are choices that can add up and can end up making a positive health difference			1
‘ the message is : a little more effort can have an important health payback			0
’ many @entity102 adults fail to reach the @entity104 guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate - intensity exercise a week , in bouts of ten minutes or more			2
and most adults in the study who had been attached to the accelerometers did not meet exercise recommendations			2
but once short bouts of activity were taken into account , men managed to exceed the guidelines , while women came close to meeting them			2
the scientists claimed that although these short bursts of exercise may not count towards fulfilling the official guidelines , they were still likely to improve people ’s overall health			1
dr @entity124 , associate medical director at the @entity125 , said : ‘ this supports what we know about exercise and weight loss			2
‘ adults should be doing exercise every week to keep a healthy weight and ward off life - threatening conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes			2
’ in a separate study published last year , an academic at @entity138 suggested that short , sharp bursts of exercise were better at warding off heart disease than longer , less strenuous sessions			1
that is because they helped speed up the rate at which fat left the blood			0
fat lingering in the blood is known to trigger the first in a series of steps that can lead to clogging of the arteries and heart disease			0
the study found that walking cut fat levels by 11 per cent , compared with not doing any exercise			0
but short bursts of sprints on a bike cut it by 33 per cent – the sort of effect expected from a 90 - minute run .			1

scientists suggest short bursts of daily exercise more effective than long *infrequent* sessions
