as the @entity1 looms , @entity0 has become a regular on tv news shows , pontificating about why @entity4 needs ‘ a peaceful political revolution ’			1
and her message has found an audience , especially among young voters alienated by what they see as the abject failures of politicians in the two main parties			1
but not many are aware how hard - @entity14 ’s policies are : a desire to ban the monarchy , the @entity17 and much of the @entity18 , and to make illegal the sale of fur and ‘ cruel ’ foods such as foie gras – while also introducing laws which would lead to more drug - use , laxer border controls , legal brothels and make it lawful to join terror groups such as @entity29			1
after being eviscerated on tv recently by @entity43 , when he forensically ripped apart her naive , uncosted soundbites , and now by @entity34 on radio , @entity14 has been exposed as a poor media performer who is lamentably weak on policy detail – although in truth , some of her party ’s core demands are pretty difficult to defend			1
a @entity54 ex-minister who has shared a podium with her says : ‘ she ’s just not up to the job – you have to have a grasp of detail to survive an election campaign			1
' she displays a lack of coherence , clarity and credibility that is ridiculous for a party contesting a general election			1
’ so who is this bombastic blonde @entity70 who wants to reshape @entity4 ? @entity14 was born in 1966 to teenage parents in a working - class suburb of @entity74			1
her father was an apprentice carpenter and her mother a part - time secretary			1
@entity14 claims her conversion to feminism occurred – along with a determination to change the world – at the age of five when her grandmother refused to let her have a bicycle			1
‘ i was told that polite ladies did not ride bikes , ’ she has said			2
‘ i was also told similar things later when i wanted to play rugby			2
’ @entity14 has been accused of lacking ' coherence , clarity and credibility ' by a @entity54 ex-minister @entity14 has said that she also decided around the same time that she did not want children – a vow she has kept			2
@entity14 studied agricultural science at university , but by the end of her course , she had changed her mind and set her heart on journalism , becoming the solitary reporter on a small paper serving an agricultural town of 1,000 people			2
like many young @entity70 , she then decided to go backpacking around @entity109			1
but tragedy struck aged 23 when her mother died in a car crash			2
she returned to @entity112 for three years to support her father , but had already decided to leave @entity70 for good			2
she has since said her native country seemed small - minded and ‘ anti-intellectual ’ , even telling one interviewer : ‘ i ca n’t imagine going there by choice			2
’ settling in @entity4 16 years ago after a spell of voluntary work in @entity119 , she spent six years working as a sub-editor on the @entity121 and @entity122 , finally ending up as editor of @entity124			2
newspaper colleagues remember her powerful ‘ honking ’ voice and strident opinions			0
( one of her more absurd views is that @entity132 ’s football team should not play against nations with nasty governments			0
) as a @entity135 on january 1 , 2006 , she joined the @entity31 as part of a promise to herself to get involved in politics			1
@entity14 at the launch of the @entity31 election campaign on tuesday			1
she won the party leadership in 2012 rapidly , she made waves at her local @entity145 branch in @entity146 with her devotion to the cause			0
‘ she was one of those brilliant new members who volunteer to do lots of things , as well as having a terrific strategic brain and being very well - organised , ’ said one fellow member			0
eventually , in 2012 , she stood as party leader – seeing off three rivals to win 60 per cent of the 3,000 - member vote and thus becoming the first @entity70 - born head of a political party in @entity4			1
it was her first significant electoral success for she had already failed to win a council seat in @entity145 and got a paltry 2.7 per cent of the vote when she fought the safe @entity54 seat of @entity163 and @entity164 in 2010			0
she is standing again in the seat in may and lives in the same area of @entity146 with her partner @entity167 , a freelance political campaigner who writes occasionally for the extreme - left @entity169 newspaper			0
@entity14 is credited with strengthening a previously chaotic party organisation which has led to party membership soaring from 20,000 in october to more than 50,000			0
only time – and the election in may – will tell if this support melts away again , just as it did after the @entity174 won 15 per cent of the vote in the 1989 @entity109 elections			0
but one thing is certain			0
this ambitious @entity70 will have to make a much better fist of explaining her policies if she has any hope of radically transforming her new nation – which many fear would result in the economy being wrecked and much - loved traditions destroyed			1
politicians have a history of saying things on tape that they later regret			1
during the 2010 general election campaign , former prime minister @entity191 was recorded talking about voter @entity193 being a ‘ bigoted woman ’ after she asked him a question about immigration			0
mr @entity191 had left the campaign event but had left a tv microphone on as he travelled in his car			0
in 2009 , @entity200 said ‘ too many tweets might make a t * * t ’ in a radio interview			1
he compounded the slip - up when he said he was sorry if people were ‘ p * * * ed off ’			0
last year former @entity207 minister @entity206 was taped calling a taxi driver a ‘ sweaty , stupid little s * * t ’			0
in 2006 , @entity210 ’s wife @entity209 denied claims she had uttered ‘ that ’s a lie ’ as mr @entity191 heaped praise on her husband during a party conference speech			0
then prime minister @entity191 with @entity193 in @entity216			0
his subsequent gaffe , when he was recorded branding her a ' bigoted woman ' , did massive damage to his election campaign			0

@entity31 leader has found an audience among young voters alienated by what they see as the failures of politicians in the two main parties
but ' she will have to make a much better fist of explaining her policies if she has any hope of radically transforming her new nation '
