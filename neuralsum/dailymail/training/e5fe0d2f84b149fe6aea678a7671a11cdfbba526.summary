by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 04:05 est , 10 may 2012 the @entity1 will feature apps that designed for pcs as well as for mobile devices such as @entity5 and @entity7 smartphones			1
if a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device , @entity8 said it will direct users to @entity14 's @entity13 or @entity16 's play store to download the app if @entity14 and @entity16 can do it , so can social network @entity8 - the site is to launch an ' app store ' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue			1
the app store will also allow developers to sell apps direct to consumers for the first time via the network			1
it 's the latest in a series of moves to ' spruce up ' the number one social network in advance of a flotation on the stock market expected to take place later this month - and to convince investors it can earn more money			1
apps such as games - particularly @entity47 's titles such as @entity48 - are a major source of @entity8 's revenue , a fact the network is keen to hammer home			1
the @entity1 will , for the first time , allow software developers to sell apps to consumers directly on @entity8			1
' many developers have been successful with in - app purchases , but to support more types of apps on @entity8 , we will give developers the option to offer paid apps			1
this is a simple - to - implement payment feature that lets people pay a flat fee to use an app on @entity8 , ' says @entity8 's developer blog			1
' for the over 900 million people that use @entity8 , the @entity1 will become the new , central place to find great apps like @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 , ' said the site 's developer blog			1
the apps will be ' rated ' by users , as they are on @entity16 's play and @entity14 's @entity87 - which should help weed out apps that exist only to spam people via the site			1
the new @entity1 , which @entity8 said will launch in the next few weeks , comes as the company is preparing an initial public offering that would value the company between $ 77 billion and $ 96 billion			0
a key concern for investors is @entity8 's slowing revenue growth , due in part to the widening trend of consumers accessing its service on smartphones , where @entity8 provides limited ads. in an amended prospectus filed with the @entity104 on wednesday , @entity8 said the popularity of mobile devices has caused its number of daily users to grow faster than the number of ads it is delivering			1
@entity8 makes the vast majority of its revenue from online ads , although it also collects fees when consumers purchase goods from within social apps , such as @entity47 's @entity118			1
if @entity14 and @entity16 can do it , so can social network @entity8 - the site is to launch an ' app store ' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue consumers will need to use @entity126 , the company 's payment system , to purchase the apps and @entity8 will take a 30 percent cut of the revenue as it does with in - app purchases , said @entity8 spokeswoman @entity133			1
@entity8 is introducing the app service to give software developers additional options , but the company expects in - app purchases to remain more prevalent on the social network , said @entity133			1
apps , ranging from social games to music services , are popular activities on @entity8 , the world 's no.1 online social network with roughly 900 million users			1
according to the company , 200 of the apps that are available on @entity8 have more than 1 million users			2

the ipo could raise as much as $ 11.8 billion in @entity191 's largest ipo ever			0
investors are expected to flock to the highly anticipated ipo , though some have voiced concerns about the social network 's longer - term growth			2
last week , @entity8 reported its first quarter - to - quarter revenue slide in at least two years			2
