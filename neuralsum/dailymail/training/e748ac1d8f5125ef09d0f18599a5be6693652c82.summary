in charge : @entity1 was elected president of @entity3 on sunday and now his party - the @entity4 - is restored to power after a 12 year absence @entity3 's newly elected government could start negotiating with the country 's brutal drug lords in a bid to buy peace , senior @entity8 politicians have warned			1
@entity1 's campaign team claimed victory in the country 's presidential election on sunday after exit polls showed him winning by a comfortable margin			1
but critics have warned his victory could mark a softening of the country 's war on drug cartels			1
@entity1 , 45 , of the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) , had campaigned on switching authorities ' efforts to reducing violence rather than smashing the drug lords			1
opponents fear the new government might now enter into talks with the cartels , thought to be responsible for 47,500 deaths so far			1
@entity1 has repeatedly denied wanting to open up negotiations - though this has not assuaged fears among some senior @entity8 politicians			2
@entity40 @entity39 told a congressional hearing that he feared the history of @entity1 's party had a history of ' turning a blind eye to the cartels '			1
he said : ‘ while in power , the @entity4 minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels , ’ adding that @entity1 ‘ does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins ’			1
according to the latest figures , @entity1 led by between 8 and 11 percentage points in exit polls published by three of @entity3 's main television networks after voting ended on sunday night			1
the @entity4 had governed @entity3 for 71 years but lost power in 2000 - ushering in a new hardline government which declared war on the cartels			1
soon after taking power in december 2006 , president @entity59 announced a major new offensive on the narcotic rings			0
the moves were welcomed by the @entity8 which pledged $ 1.6 billion to aid the fight			0
his campaign manager , @entity95 , declared victory shortly after the exit polls were released			0
' it is a resounding triumph , ' mr @entity95 told @entity100 television , adding that he was hopeful the @entity4 would have a majority in the @entity102 and possibly in the lower house of @entity104 , too			0
the exit polls showed him winning around 40 per cent of the vote			0
leftist rival @entity107 was in second place with @entity109 of the ruling @entity110 , or @entity110 , trailing in third			0
' i recognize that the trend up to this point is not in my favor , ' said @entity109 , whose campaign was dragged down by a brutal war with drug cartels and the government 's patchy economic record			1
preliminary official results were due in the next few hours			0
' it 's time for the @entity4 to return			0
they 're the only ones who know how to govern , ' said @entity125 , 70 , as she voted in the beach resort of @entity127			0
to the streets : the weekend was busy in @entity3 as saturday was the country 's gay pride parade ( pictured ) and sunday was the national election ' the @entity4 is tough , but they wo n't let the drug violence get out of control			2
' others feared a return to the worst years of @entity4 rule and put @entity1 's big lead down to his cozy relationship with @entity139 , @entity3 's top broadcaster			1
' it 's the same party as ever and the people who vote for him ( @entity1 ) believe they are going to live happily ever after like in the soap operas , ' @entity141 , a systems engineer , said as he went to vote in @entity145			2
by the time it lost to the @entity110 in 2000 , the @entity4 had a reputation for widespread corruption , electoral fraud and authoritarianism			0
the @entity4 was in disarray by 2006 , when its presidential candidate came in a distant third , but it has rebounded since then and @entity1 gave it a new face			2
he is promising to restore security to cities and towns ravaged by the drug war and also plans to reform @entity89 , a proposal once considered political suicide			0
@entity3 are fiercely protective of @entity89 , but the @entity4 , which nationalized oil production in 1938 , could be the one party able to liberalize the energy industry			2
the @entity4 laid the foundations of the modern state with a nimble blend of politics and patronage that allowed it to appeal to labor unions and captains of industry at the same time			0
@entity3 eventually tired of heavy - handedness that stifled dissent , rewarded loyalists and allowed widespread corruption .			2

@entity1 's presidential victory will see @entity3 government negotiation peace with drug lords , opponents fear
@entity1 's party accused of ' turning a blind eye ' to brutal cartels
@entity3 drug cartels responsible for nearly *50,000* deaths so far
