the match was memorable for @entity0 's early heroics but little else as both sides produced a string of errors to leave both coaches frustrated			1
the record for the fastest hat - trick of tries scored from the start of any match remains with @entity7 's former player and current assistant coach @entity54 , who scored his within six minutes and 54 seconds of the @entity7 ' @entity56 semi-final against @entity58 in 2002			1

@entity26 kicked all three conversions to make it 18 - 0 but @entity15 , who gave debuts to centre @entity75 and forward @entity76 , gradually weathered the storm and scored two tries of their own in a nine - minute spell midway through the first half			0
centre @entity83 got the first after @entity7 winger @entity86 had made a hash of @entity89 's high kick while veteran second rower @entity90 proved impossible to tackle as he got skipper @entity92 over			0

@entity15 's @entity83 is tacked by @entity7 ' @entity26 ( left ) and @entity100 ( right ) @entity101 , drafted in at short notice when @entity103 pulled out of the @entity7 team for personal reasons and switched from second row to centre when winger @entity107 went off with a shoulder injury on 17 minutes , was the biggest culprit , twice dropping the ball with the tryline beckoning			0
@entity26 regathered his own chip over the @entity15 defence but saw the final pass intercepted and prop @entity115 was held up over the line on his back while @entity15 forward @entity118 had a try chalked off for a forward pass			0
