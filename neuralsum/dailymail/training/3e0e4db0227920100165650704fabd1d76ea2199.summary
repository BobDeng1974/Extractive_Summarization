but little to do they know , the worst is yet to come			0
the hardest part of parenting is when a child first hits the age of 13 , a new study has revealed			1

they said that problems caused by surging hormones , indifferent attitudes and growing sexual awareness makes this period the hardest time of parenthood			2
the study , by parenting website @entity28 , looked into the difficulties of bringing up children and the various issues parents have to face			1
@entity35 , founder of @entity28 , said : ‘ it ’s easy to overlook that being a parent to a teenager is perhaps more testing than with a newborn			1
‘ it was quite comforting for me to learn other parents think 13 is the hardest age as it is almost like a re-birth of your children when puberty kicks in			1
‘ the change can seem it has occurred almost overnight , and the child you thought you knew has suddenly turned into somebody you do n’t recognise			0
‘ i often liken the change to the sulky teenager @entity54 in the comedy sketch by @entity56 - a young man becoming a werewolf once they reach 13			2
‘ but i think mums and dads are better at understanding the pressures of being a teenager more than their adolescent children realise			0
’ almost a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of the 1,000 mothers and fathers questioned said that their children were most troublesome at 13			0
and the biggest cause of arguments was found to be teenagers ’ laziness			1
more than half of parents - 55 per cent - say teenage children not pulling their weight with household chores was a common cause for a row			1
while there are many happy aspects to bringing up children , almost a quarter of the 1,000 parents questioned said their children were most troublesome at 13 mrs @entity35 , 44 , added : ‘ the difference between caring for a teenage child and a newborn is that parents have to be in charge in a completely different way			1
‘ teens will try to push the boundaries and push buttons you did n’t think you even had			0
‘ parents have to give their adolescent children room to find their feet given their new state of independence			0
‘ but it is all about compromise , parents still have to let the child know there is a line they ca n’t cross			2
‘ i often liken the change to the sulky teenager @entity54 in the comedy sketch by @entity56 - a young man becoming a werewolf once they reach 13 ' - @entity35 , founder of @entity28 ‘ i think 13 might be the 15 of previous generations as puberty is hitting a little bit earlier these days			1
’ the study found that other tough issues which rear their heads at this age included children becoming concerned about their body image and depression			1
a worried 14 per cent admit that their teens are very ‘ body conscious ’ and are keen to change their body shape			0
further , a third of parents admit their child slams doors and shouts at them at least twice a week , while four per cent worry their child suffers depression			2
another major cause of concern is their children becoming sexually active			0
the research found that one in seven parents of 11 to 18 - year - olds - 14 per cent - suspect their child has lost their virginity with 43 per cent believing their child had sex for the first time while under the age of consent			1
while new parents may find it hard to imagine , raising a teenager was found to be the hardest part of parenting new technology plays a part in modern parenting as gadgets cause rows with 39 per cent of families			1
also , due to the influence of social media , nearly half of parents think their children are worried about their popularity on sites such as @entity160			2
this may explain why 49 per cent of mums and dads believe their kids fret about ‘ being cool ’ and ‘ fitting in ’			0
the poll of parents in the @entity167 found more important priorities like education and career paths were not high on the agenda for teens			2
in addition , after 13 the next toughest stages of parenting mother and fathers complained of , were all when children are in their adolescence - the ages of 11 , 12 and 14			2
the research did however reveal that by the time children are 17 the relationship they have with parents improves considerably			0
mother - of - three @entity184 , who has two children in their late teens , agrees that 13 was a tough age to deal with			0
the 53 - year - old receptionist from @entity189 , @entity190 , said : ‘ they seem to undergo a change around that time in attitude and mood and other things enter their lives which were n’t previously an issue			0
‘ their constant mood swings and laziness would often lead to arguments and them shutting themselves in their room for hours on end			0
‘ all of a sudden you find yourself worrying about things that had never been an issue before - such as sex and their social lives .			0
