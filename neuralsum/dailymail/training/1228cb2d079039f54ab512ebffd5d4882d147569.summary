by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 17 october 2012 @entity1 has turned off its controversial tag suggestions feature for users in @entity4 , in a move that campaigners will hail as a victory for privacy			1
the social network tool took biometric information provided when users tag friends ' faces in photos to make suggestions on the correct tags for future images			1
but the company was heavily criticised when it introduced the feature and automatically opted - in all users in @entity4 last june without formally announcing its arrival on the site			1
with the facial - recognition feature activated on the site , this meant in essence that those uploading photos were handing the personal biometric information of those photographed over to the company			1
the removal of the feature and the forced deletion of all the biometric data will be a blow to the company which is under intense pressure to find new ways to convert its vast hoard users ' personal information into cash since it was floated on the stock market earlier this year			1
@entity55 , @entity1 ceo : the decision will be a blow to the company which is under pressure to find new ways to rake in more money responding to the removal of the feature , @entity62 , director of privacy campaign group @entity63 , said : ' users need to be in control of what happens to their data and it ’s absolutely right this applies to people ’s pictures on @entity1 in the same way as their written personal information			1
' the wider issue is not just about people opting - in to use the technology , but how you regulate something when often the person in the photo might not be aware their photo has even been uploaded			2
' facial recognition has the potential to undermine people ’s privacy far more dramatically than most existing technology , with ever more creative uses finding ways to track us and target us			2
' @entity1 was forced to carry out a review of the controversial feature 's introduction after a wave of anger about potential data protection issues			0
it announced last month that it would suspend the feature across @entity4 and erase all the biometric facial - recognition data it has collected thus far from users on the continent by october 15			1
@entity4 regulators have ordered @entity102 to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out of it			0
@entity108 ’s @entity107 led a @entity4 investigation into @entity102 ’s new unified policy , which replaced 60 individual policies for its search , email and other services and regulates how it uses the personal data it collects			1
@entity117 's president @entity116 said the company had ' three or four months ' to make the revisions , otherwise ' authorities in several countries can take action against @entity102 '			1
@entity102 responded that it is reviewing the commission ’s report but that it believes its policy respects @entity4 law			0
the current row revolves around @entity102 's decision to pool of anonymous user data across @entity102 services			2
for @entity102 , this is a big advantage when selling online ads. @entity102 and other large internet groups like @entity1 provide free services to consumers and earn money from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than traditional tv or radio campaigns			0
the move followed a review by @entity143 of the degree to which the social networking site had implemented recommendations made in an audit of the social networking site by the @entity149 last december			1
that report assessed @entity1 @entity143 ’s compliance with @entity154 @entity153 law and by extension @entity156 law			0
the aim is to re-introduce the tag feature in the future , but with new guidelines and different forms of notice and consent			0
@entity165 , the @entity166 for @entity143 , said last month the tool would only return to the site if @entity1 agreed with the department on the ' most appropriate means of collecting user consent '			0
he praised the multi-billion pound company for ' sending a clear signal of its wish to demonstrate its commitment to best practice in data protection compliance			2
' mr @entity165 says @entity1 should make users more aware of what happens to their personal data to increase control over privacy settings			2
mr @entity62 added : ' it may be possible in future to find a way to use facial recognition on @entity1 in very limited circumstances			0
' however , given the challenge of securing consent from both the person uploading the photo and the people in the photo being scanned , it may be practically impossible to secure an adequate level of consent			0
' what must not happen is the consent requirement be watered down because it proves difficult			0

decision taken following probe by the @entity149
campaigners had warned against personal biometric information being given to the company without the permission of those pictured
