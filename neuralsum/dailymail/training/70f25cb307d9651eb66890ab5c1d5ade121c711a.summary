' my mother - in - law @entity6 told me she was taking care of it all and she never handed anything over			1
' but last week @entity17 , 73 , made a tearful confession to a priest and her family that the baby had not died , and that in fact she had sold him at birth to a childless couple			1
she said that she had arranged it with her other daughter - in - law @entity44 , who worked at the hospital and helped forge the adoption documentation			1
the remaining twin , @entity47 , now a priest himself , said : ' i have often spoken to people who told me they had seen me somewhere that i never was			1
i believe they must have seen my twin brother and mistaken him for me			2
' it means that even now we must look similar and i 'm hoping that if he sees my picture , he will recognise himself and get in touch			0
or if not at least somebody that knows him will contact me			0
' the family have posted pictures of the remaining twin , @entity10 , on social media in the hope that if his twin @entity11 is still in the country he will recognized			1

many @entity1 babies were adopted by wealthy foreign couples before the practice was stopped under pressure from the @entity79			0
after @entity17 's confession , her son and grandson raced to question her more , but she died before she could provide any more details			1
when the family spoke to police officers confirmed none of the documentation for @entity11 's death was in order and it seemed clear that the baby had not died on november 1 , 1984 , as they had been told			2
in fact hospital records showed he was still at the hospital and being breastfed on november 4			0
denials : @entity44 , 51 , @entity17 's other daughter - in - law who she accused of being complicit in the sale of the boy			1
she has denied the allegations says she was as shocked ' as everybody else ' a police spokesman said : ' it seems that both babies were still there although the parents did n't know about it , and because they were identical twins who were only ever given to the teenage mother one at a time she did n't realise that they were both still alive			0
' @entity44 , 51 , @entity6 's other daughter in law who worked at the hospital and who she implicated in the sale of the child , denied any involvement			2
