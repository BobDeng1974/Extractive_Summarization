@entity10 's greatest living scientist launched the @entity12 opening ceremony with a @entity13 last night , beginning with a plea to more than a billion viewers across the planet , simply , to ' be curious '			1
the renowned astrophysicist took centre stage during the extravaganza as he guided his audience through a ' journey of discovery of the wonder of science '			2
as a giant flaming orb descended from the heavens , prof @entity8 's instantly recognisable computerised voice boomed through the arena - and offered some choice words of advice			1
as one of @entity10 's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity , prof @entity8 wheeled onto the stage and implored the world to ' look up at the stars , not down at your feet '			1
the 70 - year - old , who has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 , went on to lead the 62,000 - strong audience through a ' journey of discovery ' - which organisers said was inspired by his seminal book @entity45			1
but despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed and unable to speak , he said : ' we live in a universe governed by rational laws that we can discover and understand			2
' look up at the stars , and not down at your feet			1
' try to make sense of what you see , and wonder about what makes the universe exist			2
' from there on , the spectacular was punctuated by the authoritative voice of @entity10 's greatest living scientist			2
' there ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe , and what can be more special than that there is no boundary , ' he echoed later			2
' and there should be no boundary to human endeavour			2
' prof @entity8 's countless scientific papers , best - selling books and numerous awards have earned him comparisons with @entity75 and sir @entity76			1
disabled genius : in his instantly - recognisable computerised voice , @entity10 's greatest living scientist told the audience , ' try to make sense of what you see , and wonder about what makes the universe exist ' inspiration : as one of @entity10 's most powerful symbols of human triumph over adversity , prof @entity8 , 70 , has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but prof @entity8 is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist , appearing on tv cartoon @entity93 , starring in @entity94 and providing narration for a @entity97 commercial that was later sampled on a @entity99 album			1
in the 1970s , already confined to a wheelchair , he produced a stream of first class research , including probably his most important contribution to cosmology			2
genius : @entity8 at his @entity107 graduation in 1962 - two years before his diagnosis with motor neurone disease this was the discovery of @entity8 radiation , which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing			1
by applying quantum mechanics to black holes , he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity			2
one describes the universe at the sub-atomic level , and the other at very large scales			2
bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics			0
in the 1980s , prof @entity8 and professor @entity129 , from the @entity130 at @entity131 , proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time			1
the concept was described in @entity45 , which sold 25 million copies worldwide			0
in recent years , prof @entity8 has examined the relationship between science and religion , writing a 2010 book , grand design , which argues that evoking @entity143 is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe			1
he met the @entity145 at a scientific event hosted by the @entity147 in 2008			0
to the sound of @entity151 's hit song ' umbrella ' , the dancers - many of whom have physical disabilities - then glided apart to reveal a giant umbrella at the centre of the stage			1
then , in true @entity10 fashion , the words of @entity157 once again echoed through the stadium , as veteran showman sir @entity160 trod the stage as @entity162 , announcing : ' the greatest adventure is what lies ahead			0
' the extravaganza , directed by @entity166 and @entity167 , was billed as a voyage across ' a sea of ideas ' - including @entity76 's discovery of gravity , which all @entity174 - bound athletes strive against			1
powerful symbol : as one of @entity10 's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity , prof @entity8 , 70 , has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22 science to the masses : some of @entity185 's books including his international bestseller @entity45 @entity166 said : ' our talks with @entity8 began towards the end of last year			1
' we worked very closely with professor @entity8 to develop a series of messages which are very much integrated into the storytelling of the ceremony			0
@entity194 ( @entity194 ) attacks the nervous system and leaves muscles damaged , causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech , swallowing and breathing			0
one in 50,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years of its onset			1
its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an individual 's damaged genetic make - up might be a contributory factor			1
there is currently no cure			0
@entity8 , who is confined to a wheelchair , is the world 's best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis			1
he is an exceptional case , having survived for more than 40 years , despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed			0
' we have spent time with him in @entity226 and have been so incredibly gratified with him giving his time			0
' everybody knows about @entity229 and his extraordinary theoretical work and writings about science which have made very complex ideas accessible to all of us , but what came through in our meetings with him was the humanity and the humour of him			0
he is a fun guy			0
' co-artistic director @entity167 added : ' tonight you will be taken on the most exquisite journey of discovery inspired by the wonder of science			0
' it is about the wonder of science and it is @entity8 who guides us			0
' @entity250 and @entity160 in their narrative talk about what we all need to remember ; do nâ€™t just look down at your feet , look at the stars , be curious			1
' the show included 73 deaf and disabled professional performers and 68 disabled people among its 3,250 volunteers			1
a packed @entity263 and millions more across the world watched as the ' spectacular and deeply human ' ceremony unfolded before double amputee @entity267 war veteran @entity266 flew in on a zip wire to light the flame			0
six @entity12 and former competitors - including @entity272 - were flown into the stadium in gold wheelchairs			1
accompanying the athletics star were fellow @entity12 @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280			0
the ceremony heralded the start of 11 days of elite sporting action featuring athletes from across the world and before sell - out crowds who have made this the most successful @entity12 in history			1
earlier prof @entity8 said : ' the @entity12 is about transforming our perception of the world			2
' we are all different			0
there is no such thing as a standard or run - of - the - mill human being but we share the same human spirit			2
true @entity10 : sir @entity160 assumed the role of @entity299 from the @entity300 , announcing : ' the greatest adventure is what lies ahead			0
' @entity13 : the flaming globe descended into a giant umbrella symbolic : the renowned astrophysicist lead hundreds of umbrella - waiving , right , performers as a giant flaming globe descended into the stadium , left typically @entity10 : to the sound of @entity151 's hit song ' umbrella ' , the dancers - many who have physical disabilities - then glided apart to reveal a giant umbrella at the centre of the stage ' what is important is that we have the ability to create			1
' this creativity can take many forms , from physical achievement to theoretical physics			0
' however difficult life may seem , there is always something you can do and succeed at			0
' the @entity12 were being officially opened by the @entity329 , who said in a statement released in advance : ' it is with tremendous pride that the people of @entity335 and the @entity10 welcome the world to the @entity337			0
' @entity338 are returning to the country where they first began , more than 60 years ago			0
' we look forward to celebrating the uplifting spirit which distinguishes the @entity12 from other events , drawing on @entity10 's unique sporting heritage			0
