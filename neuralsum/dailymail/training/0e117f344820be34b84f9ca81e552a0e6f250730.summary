by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 29 april 2013 @entity2 : 06:06 est , 30 april 2013 a spaceship backed by sir @entity4 has made its first powered flight in a test that moves @entity7 toward its goal of flying into space later this year			1
while @entity11 did not break out of the atmosphere during the test flight , it marked a significant milestone for @entity7 , which intends to take passengers on suborbital joyrides			2
during the early morning flight , @entity11 , strapped beneath a twin - fuselage jet , took off from an airport runway in the @entity20 north of @entity21			2
the spacecraft was dropped from its ' mothership ' , @entity26 over the @entity20 before firing its hybrid power motor and breaking the speed of sound a frame from the @entity30 mounted on @entity11 during its first rocket - powered flight the craft did not break the atmosphere but the test moves @entity7 toward its goal of flying into space later this year the test began at 7:02 a.m. local time when @entity39 took off from @entity40 mated to @entity26 ( @entity41 ) , @entity7 ’s carrier aircraft			1
piloting @entity39 were @entity43 , pilot , and @entity45 , co-pilot , who are test pilots for @entity47 , which built @entity39 for @entity7			0
at the @entity41 controls were @entity7 ’s chief pilot @entity50 , assisted by @entity51 and @entity52 , co-pilot and flight test engineer , respectively , for @entity47			2
upon reaching 47,000 feet altitude and approximately 45 minutes into the flight , @entity39 was released from @entity41			1
after cross-checking data and verifying stable control , the pilots triggered ignition of the rocket motor , causing the main oxidizer valve to open and igniters to fire within the fuel case			0
at this point , @entity39 was propelled forward and upward to a maximum altitude of 55,000 feet			0
the entire engine burn lasted 16 seconds , as planned			0
during this time , @entity39 went supersonic , achieving @entity67 1.2			1
the entire rocket - powered flight test lasted just over 10 minutes , culminating in a smooth landing for @entity39 in @entity20 at approximately 8 a.m. local time			1
the jet released @entity11 , which ignited its engine for 16 seconds , then glided to a safe landing			2
until now , @entity11 has only performed unpowered glide flights			0
several powered flights are planned this summer , culminating with a dash into space targeted toward the end of the year			1
' the first powered flight of @entity82 was without any doubt , our single most important flight test to date , ' said @entity7 founder sir @entity4 , who was on the ground in @entity20 to witness the occasion			2
' for the first time , we were able to prove the key components of the system , fully integrated and in flight			1
' today ’s supersonic success opens the way for a rapid expansion of the spaceship ’s powered flight envelope , with a very realistic goal of full space flight by the year ’s end			1
' we saw history in the making today and i could n’t be more proud of everyone involved			0
' @entity11 is the commercial version of @entity101 , which in 2004 became the first private manned rocket to reach space			0
since the historic flight , more than 500 aspiring space tourists have paid 200,000 dollars ( £ 130,000 ) or placed deposits , waiting for a chance to float in weightlessness and view the @entity110 's curvature from 62 miles up			1
@entity7 's @entity111 is shown on its maiden flight from the @entity113 and @entity114 in @entity20 , @entity115 in 2010			0
the rocket plane ( c ) , dubbed the @entity117 , is shown attached to the @entity26 two carrier airplane			0
@entity7 's @entity11 flies over the @entity20 shortly before breaking the sound barrier @entity7 's @entity11 leaves a trail across the sky during its test flight over @entity115 sir @entity4 initially predicted commercial flights would begin in 2007 , but a deadly explosion during ground testing and longer - than - expected test flights pushed the deadline back			1
no date has been set for the first commercial flight from a custom - designed spaceport in @entity132 , but @entity7 executives have said it will come after testing is complete and it secures approval from the government			0
' the rocket motor ignition went as planned , with the expected burn duration , good engine performance and solid vehicle handling qualities throughout , ' said @entity7 president & ceo @entity141			0
' the successful outcome of this test marks a pivotal point for our program			0
' we will now embark on a handful of similar powered flight tests , and then make our first test flight to space			1
' ambition : sir @entity4 initially predicted commercial flights would begin in 2007 , but a deadly explosion during ground testing and longer - than - expected test flights pushed the deadline back			0
aiming for the stars : sir @entity4 is hoping to launch the first commercial flight into space @entity7 's @entity11 , still mated to mated to its carrier aircraft @entity26 , flies over the @entity20 in @entity115 april 29 , 2013 shortly before successfully completing a test flight that broke the sound barrier			2
@entity7 plans to start flying people aboard @entity11 as soon as test flights are complete , possibly later this year virgin in @entity111 ! once the mother ship reaches 50,000 feet , which was the cruising altitude of @entity169 , the spaceship is released and its rocket is fired , accelerating the craft up to 2,500mph , and taking it high enough to see the curvature of the earth			1

spaceship 2 was released from its mothership and rockets fired for first time
spacecraft went supersonic , achieving @entity67 1.2
expected to make its first flight into space before the end of the year
