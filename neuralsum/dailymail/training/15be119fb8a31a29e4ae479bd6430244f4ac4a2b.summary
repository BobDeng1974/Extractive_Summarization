by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:48 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 13:08 est , 29 october 2013 probe : the man who handed himself in to authorities in @entity5 has facial similarities with reconstructions of how @entity8 may now look , the family said the family of missing @entity10 today insisted they remained ‘ strong and resolute ’ as they continued their search for him after a dna test on a young man on @entity5 proved negative			1
@entity8 's mother , @entity17 , and her family spent @entity8 's 24th birthday today waiting for results of tests on a young man featured in video footage shot in @entity5 that emerged this week			1
but a post on the official help find @entity27 confirmed the dna comparison analysis had not found a match			1
the post said : ‘ the @entity31 family have , in the last few minutes ... ... had confirmation that the dna results on the man in @entity5 have came back as negative			1
' this , again , is more disappointment for @entity17 and her family			0
however , they remain strong and resolute in their search for @entity8 , and there are other leads currently being looked into which keeps their hopes alive			1
’ @entity8 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , went missing on the @entity46 island of @entity47 22 years ago , when he was a toddler			1
the man who handed himself in to authorities in @entity5 this week has facial similarities with reconstructions of how @entity8 may now look , the family said			1

@entity8 vanished on july 24 , 1991 after travelling to @entity47 with his mother and grandparents , @entity59 and @entity60 , who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of @entity63			2
over the years there have been a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him			0
last year a major new police operation focused on a mound of earth and rubble close to where @entity8 was last seen but no trace of him was found			1
investigation : @entity8 , left , has never been found but new images and a video show a @entity82 man with light brown hair and blue eyes , as in the artist 's impression above , right			1
police have now carried out dna tests on him police in @entity5 had cast doubts over whether the young @entity82 man was actually the missing @entity92 boy after revealing his birthmarks did not match up			1
a spokeswoman for @entity89 said : ' @entity89 have released the @entity95 of @entity10 to the @entity5 authorities at their request			1

hope : @entity10 's mother @entity17 , right , pictured on @entity47 with her mother @entity60 according to tv reports , the man was co-operative with police but he is believed to have told officers he is @entity129 and was visiting his girlfriend in @entity5			1
@entity8 's mother @entity17 has seen an image of the tall , blue - eyed man they had been testing , with light brown hair , wearing a blue and white striped rugby top			1
she said her ' head was all over the place ' and that the photo did bear a resemblance to @entity8			2
there is also a video of the 22 - year - old man , which has been viewed by authorities			2
he has been living in @entity5 since february , and his parents live abroad , he said			2
he told police that he recognised himself in the video and photos after they were shown on @entity5 television news but was afraid to come forward because he did n't know why they were looking for him			1
the man came to the attention of the @entity46 police when he fled the mainland with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service			2
after seeing the image , mrs @entity17 , 41 , told the @entity160 that she believed the man in the photograph could be @entity8 , who would now be aged 23			2
she said : ' i ’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how @entity8 might now look			0
' as a family we ’re greatly lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the @entity46 authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress			0
' we ’ve never given up hope of finding @entity8 and we are encouraged that the police in @entity174 are continuing to investigate			0
' the image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the @entity178 in @entity47			0
disappearance : @entity8 's family were on a trip to @entity47 , above , in 1991 when the toddler went missing @entity183 , the president the association , realised the potentially explosive nature of the images and handed them to @entity188 , the area 's @entity189			2
the video clip shows a man @entity46 sources say is between 20 and 25 , with four other men from the @entity82 community , attending a church service in @entity55 , @entity5			1
it was published with the photograph on @entity46 news site @entity199			0
despite a move by @entity46 police to excavate land in @entity47 in a bid to uncover @entity8 's body , his mother has refused to believe that her son died after being taken			0
last year , officers from @entity44 police travelled to the island to conduct their own land search , but no major new leads emerged			0
the case bears strong links to the tale of little ' @entity217 ' , the four - year - old blonde girl who was found living with @entity174 this month , after allegedly being ' trafficked '			0
search goes on : @entity220 , above , travelled to @entity47 last year to conduct their own search for missing @entity8 it has since emerged that she is the daughter of a @entity225 woman called @entity226 after dna tests proved biological link			1
mrs @entity226 , 35 , claimed she handed her daughter over to a @entity82 family after she gave birth in @entity174 and could not afford to register the new born			0
but she and her husband @entity232 , 37 , could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold @entity217 for profit			0
regardless of the conclusion , the evidence of @entity238 having acquired children who are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children could have ended up in the impoverished communities			0
@entity217 's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery			0
pictured : the case has echoes of the story of young ' @entity217 ' , above , who was found to be living with a @entity82 family last week			1

authorities in @entity263 too , seized two children from a @entity82 family to two test if they were living with their biological parents			0
in both cases , police suspected that the children , a seven - year - old girl from @entity272 and two - year - old @entity273 from @entity274 , might be victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike the rest of their immediate family			0
tests have since shown that both children were living with their real parents .			0

tests were on young man in video shot in @entity5 that emerged this week
