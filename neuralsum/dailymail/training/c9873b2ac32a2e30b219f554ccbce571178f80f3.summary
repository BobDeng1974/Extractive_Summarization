@entity0 branded @entity2 referee @entity1 the worst he had ever encountered after the controversial red card that crushed @entity6 ’s @entity5 dreams			1
the @entity7 was sent off after just 36 minutes of the 1 - 0 second - leg defeat to @entity9 following two bookings in rapid succession			1
initially cautioned for a foul on @entity14 , @entity12 earned his marching orders for a second soft - looking offence against @entity17			1
@entity6 defender @entity0 was sent off against @entity9 following two bookings in rapid succession @entity12 ( third left ) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for @entity6 against @entity9 @entity6 were incensed by a number of other decisions – including the denial of a penalty appeal by @entity26 – and @entity27 earned a yellow card after the final whistle for voicing his opinion towards @entity1			1
it was , however , the dismissal of @entity12 that left @entity33 ’s men facing a titanic task , with their fate sealed two minutes from time when @entity37 netted a spectacular strike to clinch a 4 - 3 aggregate victory for @entity9			1
‘ it was a terrible decision , ’ @entity12 insisted			1
‘ that is the worst referee i have ever experienced in my career			1
‘ i do n’t know why he made this decision but it was shocking			2
but i watched the whole game and i do n’t understand all of the decisions he made			2
@entity12 ( right ) looks dismayed as he leaves the pitch at the @entity50 after being shown a red card @entity27 ( centre ) and @entity6 will have reason to feel aggrieved with the referee after the game ‘ i got the red card and the second yellow was just a ball in the air we are challenging for – two players			1
we are shoulder to shoulder and @entity17 got up and asked for the referee to book me again			1
he did that and it was a terrible decision			2
‘ i would never ask for an opponent to be booked but it happens in football			2
‘ what disappoints me most is that they were n’t yellow cards and it happened so early in the game			2
it was a bad decision and that should n’t happen			0
‘ there was also a shout for a penalty and a lot of other things			0
like i said , the referee got so many things wrong			1
‘ he booked @entity81 ( @entity82 ) and @entity83 ( @entity84 ) in the second half and they were n’t yellows , either			0
’ despite his outrage , @entity12 also felt a sense of personal responsibility for @entity6 failing to reach the last 16			1
@entity37 ( centre ) scores from outside the area in the 88th minute to send @entity9 through over @entity6 @entity95 ( left ) had been in great form on the night for @entity6 but could not keep @entity37 's strike out ‘ i want to apologise to my team - mates and all the fans who travelled to @entity100 , ’ he added			1
‘ i let them down and i feel terrible			0
if i ’d stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes , we ’d have had a big chance to go through			2
‘ the guys are all with me			0
they know it was n’t a red card and they have supported me already			0
but it ’s an awful feeling as the ref made a decision , i was sent off and i feel like i ’ve let them down			0
‘ we had a good gameplan and we started well			0
we learned a lot from the first leg at @entity114			0
we stayed close together as a back four and we talked a lot			0
we had chances and i think we would have had a good chance to go through			0
‘ it ’s so disappointing and i need to learn from this			0
i am young , i am learning every day and i ’ve high expectations for myself			0
