by @entity0 he is twice - divorced - so it 's no surprise that @entity3 would admit : ' i do n't really think that much of marriage '			2

' worn on her tell - tale ring finger , @entity9 first showed off the huge rock when the couple were seen enjoying a string of performances at a folk festival in @entity51 in @entity52 in october 2007			1
neither would comment at the time on an engagement , but a friend confirmed they were never engaged			1
@entity9 told how @entity3 indulged her passion for antique jewelry and once enthused to @entity58 : ' talk about someone who knows about jewelry - and the most fabulous taste ! ' she was seen wearing the ring at what would be her last public appearance on december 2 at the @entity64 at the @entity65 in @entity66			1

the mother - of - eight , who has been married for most of her life to a garbageman , added : ' she was going out with a @entity97 and travelling to @entity66 and @entity98 and i was a stay - at - home mum who has n’t really been anywhere			1

she had all that in her hands with him			2
she sacrificed a lot to be with him			2
a few years ago , she thought she ’d be with him forever and have a family			2
she knew there were other women , but she accepted it			0
' when asked about her desire for children in 2010 , @entity9 dodged the question , saying : ' let me see if i can articulate this in a way that makes sense			1
' ' i have seven wonderful sort of children in my life , by default			0
i have four fabulous grandchildren			0

my family life is a high priority			0
” @entity3 and @entity9 shared a $ 10 million home in @entity66 and a stunning apartment on the @entity153 in @entity154			1
and asked how her daughter had won the notorious @entity3 , @entity9 's adopted mother @entity155 said in 2003 : ' @entity9 is very independent and would not take any nonsense from anyone no matter how famous they were			1
' she usually knows what she wants and she gets it			0
it does n't surprise me at all that she 's tamed @entity3			0

' the singer first wed @entity171 - born @entity170 in 1971 in @entity172 in the @entity173 , although the day was marred when he made a scene because @entity170 refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement			1
the marriage was effectively over after a year , though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter , @entity179			0

he then wed @entity167 in a @entity194 woodcarver ’s hut in 1990			0
the breaking point with @entity167 was his affair with the @entity198 model @entity197 , which resulted in a son , @entity200			2
when @entity167 sued for divorce , having by then had four children by @entity3 , he crassly claimed their @entity194 wedding was legally invalid , and so the marriage was annulled ‘ by mutual agreement ’			0
however , @entity167 's rumoured settlement of $ 7.4 million ( £ 4.5 million ) made her the first @entity3 ex to describe him as ‘ very , very generous ’			0

' ' i have a bit more of a bohemian view			0
to be honest , i do n’t really think much of marriage			0

i know it ’s an elaborate fantasy			0
