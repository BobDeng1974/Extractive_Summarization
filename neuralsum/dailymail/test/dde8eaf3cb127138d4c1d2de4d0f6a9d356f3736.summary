at the helm of the @entity1 from 1934 - 45 was @entity2 , a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years who had a reputation for brutality today they are everyday heroes , @entity7 's finest , but the @entity1 has had a more chequered past than most would imagine			1
@entity10 's new book ' the @entity1 's first fifty years ' is a tale of kickbacks , mob violence and secret @entity16 members			1
@entity10 charts the early rise of the world renowned police department from it beginnings in 1898 when the @entity21 's 18 independent police forces merged into one			1
a variety of men led the force through its formative years , 21 in total			1
some were forward looking , some were practical but more than a fair share were scoundrels , larcenists or at the very least guilty of dereliction of duty			0
the department 's first chief of police , @entity31 , who held the post from 1898 - 1901 , was known as the king of kickbacks			1
a former bar tender , @entity31 had to give a backhander just to get into the force , and was never shy about trading dollars for ranks , the @entity37 reported			2
police officers of the time had to pay exorbitant fees , more than year 's starting salary to become a captain , but for @entity31 the under the table payments could easily be recovered through other means			2
in his early career , when taking command of a lower @entity52 , @entity31 was recorded as saying that there was a great deal of ' grafting ' going on among his subordinates and that he would put a stop to it so he could line his own pockets			0
on the back of bribes paid to him @entity31 was able to buy a baseball team , the @entity62 , a forerunner to the @entity62 , which he eventually sold for $ 300,000 in 1915			0
@entity64 who held @entity31 's former post from 1906 to 1909 had his own unique set of character traits and is described in ' the @entity1 's first fifty years ' as being pathologically blunt			1
a former brigadier general , @entity64 lost his leg in an @entity72 engineering accident in @entity73			0
he worked throughout his career to remove special civil service protections on police inspectors who he could not promote or demote			0
when he won his battle to fire the people he wanted he turned his attention to @entity1 captains who had the same status			2
he was recorded as saying ' i wish that about 40 police captains would die overnight			0
' @entity64 's tendency for indiscretion landed him in hot water again when he let slip the whereabouts one of his top lieutenants who had become famous for tracking down the mob			1
the police chief decided to tell reporters that his star lieutenant was on a secret mission in @entity94 tracking down the criminal backgrounds of @entity96 , @entity98 members			1
the officer was later found , shot dead outside a @entity101 café			0
@entity31 ( left ) was the king of kickbacks while @entity64 ( right ) was ' pathologically blunt ' @entity103 who presided over the @entity1 from 1918 to 1925 has become infamous for his decision not to root out @entity16 members in his own force			1
he was handed orders from the then mayor of @entity7 to look into allegations that one of the city 's baptist ministers was allowing the white supremacist group to recruit from among his parishioners			0
the extent of @entity16 influence in the city was far greater than either @entity118 or mayor @entity119 knew and an astonishing 800 suspected klansmen were found to be living in @entity7 – 30 of them were police officers			2
@entity103 ( pictured ) failed to even try and remove the @entity16 from within his own police force presented with the size of the problem and information that as far as it was known none of the individuals had broken the law , @entity103 decided to do nothing			1
@entity132 , chief of police for only one year from 1927 to 28 became famous for incompetence rather than any particularly nefarious acts			2
upon the death of @entity142 , once @entity7 's most notorious gangsters and the real - life inspiration for @entity139 's character , @entity140 , in ' @entity140 ' , warren told his top detective to take a holiday			0
@entity132 , who it has emerged may have suffered from mental problems , fumbled the open and shut case and , as @entity132 was pushed from his post , the key suspect walked free			0
at the helm of the @entity1 from 1934 - 45 was @entity2 , a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years			1
@entity2 , whose autobiography was appropriately titled , ' @entity154 ' and who would later host a radio show , ' @entity152 , ' was the embodiment of a tough cop			0
under his tenure @entity1 officers were encouraged to mercilessly beat their suspects and promotions were on offer to those who could – in @entity2 's words ' throw the gorillas around '			2
following the slow death of one officer who had been killed a week earlier @entity2 ordered his men to shoot ' wise guys ' on sight , telling them they shoulf ' draw quickly and shoot accurately ' .			0
