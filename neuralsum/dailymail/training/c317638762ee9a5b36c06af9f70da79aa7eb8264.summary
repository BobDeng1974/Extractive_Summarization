frankly , i do n’t know whether to be mortified or flattered			1
returning from a champagne reception hosted by the ship ’s captain , i discover my room attendant has lovingly folded my tatty pyjamas into an origami - style dog			1
it does n’t stop there			2
the next morning he knocks on the cabin door and asks if i need anything ironed , which , call me sensitive , i take to mean i look creased			2
come sail with me : a small ship is one of the best ways to see a grand sight such as the @entity17 it turns out that the always happy crew are one of the highlights of my cruise to the @entity23 fjords			1
they even smile as they distribute sick bags on an unusually choppy crossing of the @entity28			2
discovering the fjords on a cruise that starts and finishes in the @entity31 ( in this case , @entity32 , @entity33 ) , is simpler and cheaper than an independent exploration of this otherwise expensive country - at the @entity38 fish market , among wriggling lobsters and chunks of black whale meat , i spot £ 20 fish sandwiches and £ 24 prawn skewers			1
i scurry back to the ship for afternoon tea which , like other meals , is included in the price			1
the only extras are excursions , alcohol and a £ 5 - a - day tip. and the 425 - cabin @entity55 , with no children or nightclubs on board , is perfectly suited to the leisurely art of fjord cruising			2
built in 1965 , the ship sails under the @entity60 flag			2
her thick hull was designed to maximise stability and smash through ice			2
in recent years , she has sailed the @entity65 , the @entity66 and most of the oceans			2
her size - she accommodates just 800 people - means i quickly get to know my fellow passengers			2
at lunch on the first day i find myself sitting next to a 22 - year - old doing a molecular biology degree at @entity75 ; the next day it ’s a retired speedboat champion			0
great glacial remnants : the @entity77 ( left ) and the @entity17 ( right ) are two of @entity23 's loveliest sights by day three my boyfriend and i have become friends with our cabin neighbours , @entity83 and @entity84 , and our table tennis matches become a daily staple			1
the ship generally spends the entire day at one location , setting sail in the early evening			0
the sun sets around 10pm , making it hard to keep track of time			0
on several nights i head to the deck to watch the scenery slip by over a post-dinner drink and before i know it , it ’s 3am			0
stepping ashore , i feel unashamedly smug whenever i glance back at the vessel , which looks positively tiny alongside other ships			1
her size allows us to sail deep into the fjords			1
one stop takes us to the remote village of @entity107			0
until 1986 , when a road tunnel was built , the only way in was by boat along the narrow waterway			0
@entity107 is famous for its glacier museum , one of only two in the world			0
a video shows the calving - where ice breaks off the edge of the flow - of a @entity23 glacier larger than @entity122			1
later we walk to the base of an icy blue arm of the @entity126 glacier — the largest in continental @entity127			1
in @entity129 village in @entity130 , we slip into a tiny harbour and head for the steepest standard - gauge railway in @entity127			1
in one hour , we whizz through 20 tunnels and past thundering , foamy waterfalls before reaching @entity138 mountain station , 863m above sea level			0
one of the most surreal moments occurs on the way down , as we pause at a waterfall			0
hidden speakers blast an eerie tune , and a woman dressed as a fairy from @entity23 folklore emerges from behind a boulder and starts to dance			1
a city on the edge : @entity38 , with its colourful @entity152 wharf to the fore , is known as the ' gateway to the fjords ' we also visit @entity157 , a beautiful village in the mountainous @entity17 region			1
the area was a favourite holiday destination of @entity161 - and our guide produces a dog - eared , black - and - white photo of the @entity165 standing on the harbourside in 1937			0
the majority of land in @entity23 is privately owned and @entity157 locals have been offered millions by developers desperate to build hotels or ski resorts , but they ’re not interested			1
vast displays of wealth are considered vulgar , our guide tells us			0
he introduces us to the cashier at the local co-op - who owns the mountain above us			0
our final stop is @entity38 , a hilly , historic city that feels like a sprawling metropolis compared to the villages we ’ve passed			0
we wander around crooked wooden @entity185 houses , once the homes of @entity188 traders who arrived in the 14th century			0
as we sail out of the harbour , we squeeze past a much larger cruise ship and i watch a crew member herd passengers along the gangplank			1
the best things really do come in small packages			0
@entity196 and @entity60 ( @entity197 , 0845 430 0274 ) have an eight - night @entity199 cruise on the @entity55 departing april 25 , 2015 , from @entity32			1
a buy - one - get - one - half - price deal is available if booked by october 31 , costing £ 749 for the first person and £ 379 for the second .			0
