a 15 - year - old girl who has fled @entity2 and flown out to join jihadis in @entity4 after being ' brainwashed ' online may end up marrying an @entity6 terrorist , a counter-extremist has warned			1
@entity7 , described as a grade - a pupil who wanted to be a dentist , left her family home in @entity12 to join hardline fighters in the war - torn country			1
but a terror expert says she will most likely be told that she could best serve jihad by marrying an @entity19 fighter			2
the devastating news emerged as home secretary @entity21 talked tough about the need to crack down on extremism			2
she is believed to be with a 17 - year - old girl from @entity41 , @entity42 , whom she arranged to meet at the airport , and to have flown to @entity45 in order to enter @entity4 , where @entity48 fighters control large areas			1
last night @entity7 's distraught family , who are of @entity52 descent , begged her : ' please come back			1
we miss you very much			0
you are not in any trouble			0
we just want you to be safe and to come home as soon as possible			2
' @entity57 , an outreach officer for the counter-extremism think tank the @entity59 , warned @entity7 may have gone to become a jihadi bride			1
he said : ' we suspect what 's happened is that she met up with somebody here in @entity42 , she travelled from @entity12 to @entity42 , so she already had this romantic notion			1
' she already probably believes that she 's going to go and get married so one of two things will happen			0
' it 's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride			1
she at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior			1
@entity7 left her home in @entity12 , above , last wednesday , and is now feared to be heading for @entity4 friends and family leaving @entity7 's home in @entity77 where the schoolgirl 's family are desperate for news ' either she will have a role to play in the so - called @entity48			1
in this case she 's not a professional - she 's not a doctor , she 's not an engineer etc. ' it 's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride			1
she at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior and that 's how she will play a part in the jihad			1

' the family have not been able to make contact with @entity121 , ' he said			0
' the understanding i have is that the radicalisation is self - radicalisation as opposed to any institution			0
' there are so many forums and chatrooms on the internet that it 's easy to be led astray			0
i do n't know how she got to that stage but she was radicalised at that stage			0
