one in 20 pupils is now being taught in a grammar school , as @entity3 witnesses the quiet return of state - funded selection			1
the proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 – and almost double the historic low of 1986			1
now for the first time in 35 years , some 5 per cent of children are being taught selectively			0
@entity13 is under fire for failing to promote new grammars due to @entity17 opposition the law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding			1
but the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils			2
over the past 25 years , their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands			0
there are now more than 161,000 pupils in state - funded selective schools			1
education secretary @entity13 has come under fire from @entity30 backbenchers for failing to promote new grammars – largely because of opposition from the @entity17			2
@entity32 , chairman of the influential @entity33 , said : ‘ these figures prove that there is huge parental demand for grammar schools and selective education in the secondary system			1
@entity32 said the figures prove there is a huge parental demand for grammar schools ‘ this shows parents are voting with their feet whenever they are given the choice			1
’ he added : ‘ it is really time for the government to free up the provision of grammar school places in areas where they do n’t already exist to release this pent - up demand			2
’ the figures on the return of the grammar school come from a report compiled by the @entity58			0
it shows that in 1947 , there were 1,207 state - funded grammars in @entity3 teaching 37.8 per cent of secondary school pupils			2
by 1974 , there were just 675 , covering 12 per cent			0
a record low was reached in 1986 , when just 3 per cent of pupils were taught in state - funded grammars			2
and by 1989 , there were only 150 state - funded selective schools			1
since then a slow revival has taken place , largely thanks to the grant - maintained schools policy implemented by @entity72 , which freed schools from the control of local authorities			0
but @entity78 ’s government banned new state - funded selective schools , and the total number has now levelled out at 164			1
just seven local authority areas still have a fully selective system : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
a further 29 have partially selective secondary systems , with grammars and secondary moderns alongside comprehensives			2
despite this , the proportion of pupils taught in grammar schools has risen from 4.6 per cent to 5 per cent – thanks to their gradual expansion			1
the @entity102 report concludes : ‘ there has been a very gradual but steady increase in the number and proportion of pupils at existing grammar schools over the past 25 years as their average size has increased			1
’ @entity78 ¿ s government banned new state - funded selective schools , and the total number has now levelled out at 164 @entity111 , chairman of the @entity112 , said : ‘ grammar schools have been expanding to offer additional places over the past three decades			1
‘ this expansion has been the equivalent of 30 new schools with 1,000 pupils apiece			0
it is indicative of the strength of parental demand for selective education			1
‘ we now have a situation where in many of the existing 164 state grammars there are ten applications for every place			0
‘ hundreds of applicants pass the exam but do not get a place at a school appropriate to their ability because there are not enough places			0
‘ the government should now look at these statistics and lessen the restrictions			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity141 said : ‘ we believe good schools , including grammars , should be able to expand to meet the demands of parents			0
‘ through the expansion of the academies and free school programmes we are transforming the education system so all children are able to access a good local school			0

proportion of pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978
the law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding .
@entity13 has been *criticised* as there is a ' huge parental demand ' for more grammar schools
