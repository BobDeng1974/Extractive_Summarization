@entity0 and @entity1 are rightfully lauded as two of the most creative players in the @entity4 , but the foreign imports do n't top the minutes per chance created charts			1
perhaps surprisingly , @entity8 's @entity7 tops the list for chances created per minutes on the pitch of the @entity4 players who have clocked up a minimum of 450 minutes so far this season			2
the @entity16 winger has laid on 27 chances for team - mates in his 640 minutes , giving him an impressive minutes per chance ratio of 23.7			2

the star - studded list also included @entity34 summer signing @entity1 , who has made a bright start to his career at @entity37 , scoring three goals while creating 31 opportunities			0
@entity0 , who sits in fifth place , looks on course to break @entity42 's @entity4 assist record of 20 in a season as the @entity28 has already set up 10 goals to help @entity46 to the @entity4 's summit			2
as @entity51 's table shows , the former @entity49 man has created an astonishing 45 chances for his team - mates so far this season , but has barely missed a kick for @entity46 having been on the pitch for 1,237 minutes which means he has created a chance every 27.5 minutes			1
