by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 17 october 2013 when a series of customers made questionable comments about their @entity6 restaurant , the owners decided to hit back - and responded with a series of hilarious comebacks in broken @entity9			1
@entity10 , 46 , and @entity11 , 47 , who run a quaint village eatery in @entity13 , @entity14 , criticised guests for being ‘ stupid ’ , ‘ insignificant ’ and having ‘ a head with the same content of an airball ’			1
and when a patron at the award - winning @entity20 called mrs @entity22 ‘ aggressive ’ on @entity23 , furious mr @entity11 responded to say the reviewer ’s wife was ' capable to argue with her own shadow ’			1
hitting back : @entity10 , 46 , and @entity11 , 47 , who run @entity27 in @entity13 , @entity14 , are responding to critics with a tirade of offensive insults on @entity23 and @entity31 taking a stand : they have even told customers who dare to criticise their award - winning village restaurant in @entity14 - where main courses cost up to £ 18 - that they are ' stupid ' , ' insignificant ' and ' racist ' one review on @entity23 , called ' give this one a miss ' , said : ' went here in july and came across a very rude , mad @entity6 mamma who would n't know customer service if it hit her in the face			1
' in response , mr @entity11 said : ‘ to respond it will not be the @entity6 mamma but the husband and chef patron			1
i found your review very rude and with a prominent racist note			2
‘ i can quite understand your way of telling things because your brain level will not support any better language and manners			2
’ in another review , one customer asked if ‘ mad ’ mrs @entity22 was related to fiery @entity6 former footballer and manager @entity61			0
mr @entity11 then launched a tirade of abuse back at the diner			1
response : one review on @entity23 , called ' give this one a miss ' , said : ' went here in july and came across a very rude , mad @entity6 mamma who would n't know customer service if it hit her in the face ' it read , in broken @entity9 : ‘ dear mister , thank you for your review always welcome stupid comment ( bit of a laugh do not harm anybody )			1
but i quite understandable from a person within the head having the same content of a ball ( @entity83 )			0
’ ' we give an answer to the people who complain for the sake of it			0
i have been ironic and put in a bit of fun to my responses			1
you ca n’t please everyone in this business ' @entity11 ‘ of course the lady is mad because she welcome you , explain the menu , offer the drinks , all in a very polite manners , that ’s why she is mad ... being gentle with an insignificant person like you			1
’ the reviewer , who warned others to ‘ stay away ’ and complained that it was ‘ the only @entity6 i ’ve ever frequented that does n’t serve pizza ’ , was also giving a dressing down by the incensed owner			0
his response continued : ‘ now the serious bit ; ristorante = not pizza available , pizzeria = pizza is the main dish , ristorante e pizzeria = pizza with an extensive menu			2
complaint : one customer asked if ' mad ' mrs @entity22 was related to @entity6 former footballer @entity61 lengthy reply : the reviewer , who warned others to ' stay away ' and complained that it was ' the only @entity6 i 've ever frequented that does n't serve pizza ' , was giving a dressing down by the incensed owner			0

’ and in a further attack in response to a review entitled ‘ avoid like the plague ’ by a former professional restaurant reviewer , the chef said : ‘ as an ex restaurant reviewer you should know what a mise en place is and have a correct knowledge between a starter and a main course			1
' the criticisms can be constructive if they are right - but when they are not , we point out their mistakes			0
i know everything that happens in this restaurant ' @entity22 ‘ i strongly think the person to avoid are you too or even better keep your wife away from any person because i am sure she will be capable to argue with her own shadow			2
hope your sad life get better ( if not for you for the people they come across you and your wife )			0
’ the couple opened the restaurant in 2003 with the aim to give the customers a ‘ real taste of traditional @entity6 cuisine			1
’ the family - run business says it has ‘ the ideal marriage between the highest quality @entity6 producers and the best of local suppliers , to create authentic @entity6 cuisine in the heart of @entity174			2
’ unimpressed : one review entitled ' avoid like the plague ' was by a former professional restaurant reviewer opinion : the chef said that the man should ' have a correct knowledge between a starter and a main course ' mr @entity11 said his online responses are just ‘ honest ’ , adding that he did n’t think @entity23 was the best way to measure a business			1
he said : ‘ i always reply to the reviews on @entity23 because i want whoever gives a bad review to know when they have made a mistake			1
