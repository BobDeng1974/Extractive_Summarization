charities have criticised the sentence handed to a 22 - year - old dance coach who had sex with two 15 - year - old girls - but avoided jail after a judge said he had their ' fulsome consent '			1
@entity8 admitted two charges of sexual activity with a child after carrying on illegal relationships with both girls at once for six months			1
a judge at @entity15 said that while the behaviour was ' utterly inappropriate ' , it did not warrant a prison term or any hours of unpaid work			0
spared jail : dance coach @entity8 ( left and right outside @entity15 ) had sexual relationships with two underage girls at once , but was handed a community order after insisting he had consent instead @entity8 will attend a sex offenders ’ treatment programme , and has been handed a five - year sexual offences prevention order which will limit his contact with children			1
the judge in the case said the girls had given their ' fulsome consent ' and there had been ' complete consensual compliance '			2
but leading charities said the law of consent exists to protect youngsters from themselves			1
@entity39 , chief executive of the @entity40 , said : ' the laws in this country are quite clear to protect young women from sexual predators			2
' everyone understands the age of consent so there can be no sympathy for a man who flouts the laws in this country			2
' this was clearly a case of grooming and rape of young women and the sentence should reflect the seriousness of this heinous crime			0
' @entity59 , head of the @entity61 ’s programmes tackling sexual abuse , added : ' it is not possible for someone under 16 to consent to sex legally			1
' this law is there to protect children and young people who think they are old enough and believe they are in a loving relationship when actually the older person has taken advantage of them			1
' this is made even worse when the adult is working with young people and employed in a position of trust			0
the adult must always take full responsibility and even if the judge decides a jail sentence is not appropriate this man can clearly not be trusted to work with children and young people again			2
' celebrity : @entity8 posed for a photo with @entity88 actress @entity87 at a previous event during the case @entity8 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , was described as a former up - and - coming star in @entity91 's street dance scene			1
he organised much of his own choreography and opened his own boulevard studios in @entity97 , @entity91 , at the age of 21			1
@entity8 attended high - profile events and had mingled with celebrities including @entity88 actress @entity87			1
but @entity91 @entity15 heard he began illegal relationships with the two underage girls towards the end of 2012			1
sex between someone aged 15 or under and someone aged 16 or over is always illegal in @entity107			1
however , the @entity108 distinguishes slightly between children aged 12 or under and those aged 13 , 14 or 15			1
children aged 12 or under can not legally consent to sex , which means cases are always prosecuted as rapes or sexual assaults			1
children aged between 13 and 15 sometimes maintain that they agreed to sex , but in legal terms they still can not give consent			1
in these cases offenders are often charged with ' sexual activity with a child ' , which carries a lesser sentence			0
but such activity is still illegal because children are vulnerable and need to be protected - and it is the adult 's responsibility to stop it from happening in the first place			1
one victim 's parents allowed them to date as long as there was no sex ' until she was ready ' , the court heard			1
he had sex with one of the girls when she stayed overnight at his studios , the court heard			2
on another occasion one of the girls took a naked photo of herself in the shower , which was later discovered by her mother			1
it was only then , in may 2013 , that police were called			2
neither of the girls knew about the other , and during the relationships he told both of them : ' you ca n’t help who you fall in love with '			0
after the case unravelled the girls felt ‘ tricked and sullied ’ , the court heard			0
@entity161 , defending , said : ' had these girls been kicking and screaming , he would have been charged with rape			0
' miss @entity161 said her client was born with a large purple birthmark that left him ‘ handsome ’ on one side of his face and ‘ disfigured ’ on the other like ‘ @entity171 ’			0
he was bullied and isolated as he was subjected to repeated facial operations , she said			0
but she added : ' the victims were children and therefore needed protection			0
he failed to offer them that protection			0
' his remorse is palpable			0
he ’s lost everything - he is no @entity180 anymore			0
he ’ll never work in a dance school again			0
' caught : @entity91 @entity15 heard @entity8 would ' never work in a dance school again ' he had found his calling in dance , but had not fully matured , she added			1
judge @entity186 said @entity8 had ‘ exploited ’ his friendship with the girls , and that while the age gap was not ‘ significant , ’ consent laws were there to protect the young and vulnerable from themselves			1
but he was spared jail by the judge , who said he had had the ‘ fulsome consent ’ of both girls			2
and the judge rejected the prospect that @entity8 had ' groomed ' the girls when it was raised by the prosecutor earlier in the case			2
' i really do think you have to be extremely careful with the use of this word grooming , ' the judge said			0
' there 's grooming and there 's grooming			0
' my view is that the proper use of that term is where you have many years , a prolonged period of time , and someone in an extreme position of power ... such as a stepfather or mother 's partner who inculcates into a very young child the sense that utterly inappropriate sexual activity is the norm , by the use of inappropriate language or behaviour			2
' that 's not to say that in a situation like this there has n't been a degree of manipulation , perhaps , but to characterise this with the use of the word grooming i think one has to be very careful			0
' @entity8 was sentenced him to a three - year community order with a requirement to attend a sex offenders ’ programme			1
he was also handed a five - year @entity245 , which will restrict the contact he can have with children			1
sentencing , the judge told him : ' here there was complete consensual compliance , insofar as these two girls were concerned in incremental sexual activity which took place between you and them			0
' there is no doubt society condemns sexual misconduct generally and of this type			0
there is an age of consent in this country and it is 16 , and any sexual activity under this age is unlawful			0
' the age of consent is there to protect the young and vulnerable from themselves			2
' you are still a very young man , still fairly immature yourself			0
many years down the line that age disparity between you and the female partner would not be thought to be inappropriate at all , but when the girl is under 16 it is utterly inappropriate			0

@entity8 ran his own studio in @entity97 which he had opened aged 21
but he illegally dated two 15 - year - old girls at once over six months
one 's parents allowed liaison if there was no sex ' until she was ready '
other girl 's mother discovered a naked photo and police were called
@entity8 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , handed a 5 - year prevention order
@entity61 : law of consent is there to protect children from themselves
