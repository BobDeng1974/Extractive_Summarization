@entity0 holds the key to the future of convicted rapist @entity3			1
@entity4 stalled on signing the 26 - year - old former @entity6 striker on monday , stating that they would ‘ continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the @entity9 ’ before making a decision			2
but two club sponsors immediately threatened to withdraw their backing if the @entity14 club signed @entity3 — who was due to report for training on monday but in the end did not show — and on monday night @entity17 owner @entity0 came under pressure to withdraw @entity20 ’s sponsorship as well			1
in a letter to @entity0 she wrote : ‘ if @entity4 decide to appoint him , i would urge you to withdraw sports direct sponsorship at the club			1
it is tantamount to saying that sexual abuse is ok as long as you can play football			0
‘ my office works closely with @entity55 and has funded a number of initiatives working with young people to help them understand what is right and wrong			0
’ a police officer stands outside @entity4 's training ground on monday morning @entity4 chief executive @entity62 reads out a club statement outside @entity35 on monday afternoon @entity64 sponsors @entity65 released a statement on tuesday morning			2
' as secondary shirt sponsors , we are obviously aware of on - going speculation concerning the possible engagement of @entity3 by @entity4 , ' it read			1
' whilst there are many difficult considerations with regards to the matter , we believe that this is solely a matter for the club and we are confident that they will make the right decision in all of the circumstances			0
' whatever the outcome we are and will remain proud sponsors of the club going forward			0

convicted rapist @entity3 is without a club after his release from *prison*
@entity4 are interested in signing him , but have stalled after two sponsors threatened to withdraw their backing if the move went through
@entity17 owner @entity0 has come under pressure to withdraw his £ 1 million - a - *season* sponsorship if it were to *happen* too
@entity4 owner @entity38 would almost certainly be forced to abort his pursuit of @entity3 if @entity0 were to withdraw his sponsorship
