by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 11:48 est , 25 september 2012 a man fighting a @entity3 - like virus in a @entity5 hospital has been connected to an artificial lung to keep him alive			1
the 49 - year - old , who was born in @entity8 but is believed to have been living in @entity5 , is being treated in an intensive care unit at @entity11 's and @entity12 ’ hospital in @entity13			1
he is being treated is isolation after apparently catching the new type of coronavirus in @entity17			2
scientists have likened the infection to @entity3 , which claimed 900 lives worldwide between 2002 and 2003			1
health experts said the patient had recently travelled to @entity17 ( pictured ) , where another man has died as a result of the virus a spokeswoman for the hospital said that the man , who is in isolation , is receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity32 ) treatment , which delivers oxygen to the blood outside the body when the lungs are not able to			1
it also continuously pumps blood into and around the body			0
' we are one of five designated specialist centres in the @entity5 to offer this treatment , ' she said			2
' we are following strict infection prevention and control procedures to protect patients and staff			1
' there is no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to any other patient or member of staff			2
however , staff involved in caring for this patient are being followed up by occupational health as a precaution			0
' it is only the second confirmed case of the new illness – like @entity3 , a type of coronavirus – anywhere in the world			1
one other man , aged 60 , is known to have died in @entity17 in july , although experts believe there may be other victims			1
last night the @entity67 confirmed it was investigating a third possible case			0
they believe a patient may have died in @entity5 from the same illness , having also contracted it in the @entity73			1
at present the @entity67 does not know how much of a threat this new virus poses to the general public			0
coronaviruses cause most common colds but can also cause @entity3 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome )			2
in 2003 , a @entity3 outbreak hit more than 30 countries worldwide when the disease jumped to humans from civet cats in @entity85 before spreading to @entity86			2
scientists say it is highly unlikely it will be anywhere near as dangerous as @entity3 , although they are monitoring the situation very closely			2
the @entity67 has ordered checks to be carried out on anyone who came into contact with the @entity8 patient			1
deadly : @entity3 viruses can be seen in and surrounding a cell it is believed he developed a severe chest infection while back in @entity8 , after catching the virus in @entity17			1
when the illness worsened , the patient – or his family – then arranged for him to be flown privately by air ambulance to the @entity5 on september 11			1
initially he was treated at a private hospital in @entity13 but was then transferred to a larger @entity108 trust in the capital , which specialises in treating respiratory infections			1
he is currently being treated in an isolation unit and requires intensive care			0
it is not known whether he is likely to survive			0
all medical staff who come into contact with him are wearing masks and protective gloves			0
the @entity67 will not confirm where he is being treated , or his identity			0
scientists last night said they would be ‘ watching carefully and waiting ’ to see whether any more cases emerged			0
both confirmed victims suffered from fever , a cough and breathing difficulties			0
but the pair had never met , so scientists think at least one other person in @entity17 had the virus and passed it on			1
hundreds of people died in 2003 after a @entity3 outbreak in @entity132 ( file picture ) professor @entity134 , director of the @entity135 at @entity136 , said : ‘ for now , we need to be watchful : any evidence of human to human transmission causing severe disease would be very worrying and would raise the spectre of a new @entity3 - like outbreak			1
' the hope for now is that these cases are just highly unusual presentations of a generally mild infection , and that viral surveillance and detection is now so good that we are picking up cases that would not have been found in previous times			2
’ professor @entity152 , a virus expert at the @entity154 at the @entity155 , said : ‘ at this point it is a case of watching carefully and waiting as more data accumulates			0
‘ given that this is a respiratory infection and there have only been two cases over several months , it is not likely to represent a serious threat			1
‘ however , it is important to be watchful and to monitor for any future cases to obtain a better understanding of the true risk			0
’ professor @entity152 said it was possible the virus was initially passed on from animal droppings , just like @entity3 which is thought to have come from bats			1
at present the @entity172 says there is no reason for tourists not to visit the @entity73			0
coronaviruses were first identified in the mid 1960s and are a group of viruses causing respiratory infections in humans and animals			0
this is the first time this particular strain of coronavirus has been identified in the @entity5 and only the second time in the world - in both cases the infection was acquired in the @entity73			1
the virus was identified by the @entity67 's virus reference laboratories at @entity190			0
it is genetically the same as one recently isolated in a laboratory in @entity17 , which was then confirmed			1
@entity3 was also caused by a coronavirus			2
the two cases have experienced a serious respiratory illness which makes it similar to @entity3			1
coronaviruses can cause a range of symptoms varying from mild symptoms such as the common cold to more serious respiratory illnesses			0
as this particular strain has only been recently found there is limited information on its severity and transmission			2
in terms of symptoms , the virus has been identified in two cases of acute , serious respiratory illness who had fever , cough , shortness of breath , and breathing difficulties			2
at this point it is not clear whether these cases are typical of infection with this virus or whether it could be circulating more widely , but causing a milder illness , and only very rarely causing a severe illness			1
there is not yet enough information to make specific treatment recommendations			0
however , acute respiratory support for those with severe symptoms and who have been hospitalised would be advised			0
coronaviruses are typically spread like other respiratory infections such as influenza			0
this infection is therefore likely to be passed from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes , though much is unknown at this stage .			0
