they were discovered by volunteers two months before the end of the museum ’s three - year refurbishment programme			2
' a volunteer took photos and sent them off to the @entity36 , and they came back , identified them and said ‘ you ca n’t be sure with these things , even if they ’re old they may still be explosive , you really need to get some advice on this			0
' ' at that point we contacted the police who got the bomb squad in from @entity48 ' she said			0
' they ’ve probably been in the museum ’s collection for years , we ’ve been collecting since the 1950s			0
' there ’s a whole generation of people who during the war went and collected souvenir items , someone ’s probably had it in the back of a wardrobe for years and at some point deposited in the museum and they ’ve been in our stores ever since			0
