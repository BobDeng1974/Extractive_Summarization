by @entity0 @entity1 has announced the shake up to @entity4 opening hours doctors need more money if @entity1 ’s plans to end @entity10 ’ nine - to - five culture is to succeed , their union claimed last night			1
the prime minister announced that millions of patients will be able to see their gp at evenings and weekends for the first time thanks to an injection of extra cash			1
he said more than 7.5million people will benefit from the extended access – and from new consultation methods such as being able to phone or email a gp			1
there will also be more tailored care for the over- 75s , and a pledge that an extra 5,000 gps will be employed by 2020			0
but the @entity26 , which represents doctors , said that the £ 50million announced by the government to pay for the scheme was simply not enough to ensure the promised extended hours would be affordable in the long - term			1
they called for even more money to be given to practices to ensure the extra opening can be continued beyond the year the grant will pay for			0
and they said all doctors ’ surgeries should benefit from the extra cash – not just those in the pilot areas			1
family doctors benefited from a huge pay rise as a result of @entity43 ’s botched 2004 contract , giving them an average salary of £ 105,000			2
but the vast majority opted out of responsibility for patients at evenings and weekends			0
the average gp now works fewer hours than before the contract while patients increasingly find it hard to see their gp without taking time off work			1
this has been blamed , in part , for the surge in attendances at hard - pressed @entity57 departments			0
the prime minister also announced that about 800,000 people over 75 and those with more serious health complaints will get tailored care , co-ordinated by a single gp			1
these patients will also be offered same - day access to a gp when they need it			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ this is an important step and good news for patients			2
’ health secretary @entity84 said the elderly will benefit most from reforms health secretary @entity84 said the reforms would mostly benefit the elderly			2
‘ people want to know that their parents and relatives will get constant care if they have a long - term condition			2
many doctors already give great care but i want to make sure this is completely co-ordinated to head off problems and keep people from going to hospital unnecessarily			1
’ but dr @entity100 , chairman of the @entity26 ’s general practice committee , warned that the £ 50million funding only covered a minority of practices , and was only for one year – meaning there was no ‘ assurance of these changes being affordable in future years ’			1
‘ general practice is currently under intense pressure from escalating patient demand and falling resources , ’ he said			0
‘ these changes will need to be properly supported			0
ministers must also deliver on their commitment to increase resources in the community so that there are more gps , nurses and other health and social care services to provide co-ordinated care to the escalating number of patients who need care closer to home			0
’ the @entity26 is arguing surgeries need more money for the shift to be feasible lessons must be learned from @entity133 scandal , mps warned commons committee claims there is a culture of denial in @entity138 warning comes on the back of report revealing thousands of elderly are ' suffering in silence ' on hospital wards tragedies like the @entity133 scandal could be repeated unless there is a revolution in the way the public sector deals with complaints , mps warned last night			1
a commons committee found there was a culture of denial among managers in councils , schools and the health service – meaning they take little notice of criticism			1
their failure to listen is so bad that aggrieved members of the public simply believe there is no point in making complaints , mps found			2
tragedies like the @entity133 scandal could be repeated unless lessons are learned by the public sector the report from the @entity172 public administration select committee comes a week after @entity71 ’s top health watchdog warned that tens of thousands of elderly people were ‘ suffering in silence ’ on @entity138 wards because they were too polite to ‘ make a fuss ’			1
in an article for the @entity181 , @entity182 , the health service ombudsman , called for a ‘ significant cultural shift ’ in the way complaints are handled			0
the @entity162 ’ report also highlighted the failures that were exposed in the damning review by @entity190 on @entity133 , where up to 1,200 died amid appalling neglect			1
tens of thousands of elderly people are ' suffering in silence ' on wards , according to a report			1
stock image it called on ministers to force a culture change across the public sector to prevent future @entity202 chairman @entity201 said : ‘ there needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run , and how the public perceives government			2
@entity201 : ' there needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run ' ‘ as things are , most people believe there is no point in complaining			2
unless and until we have a culture of leadership in public services that listens to , values and responds to complaints from service users and staff , there will always be the potential for tragedies like @entity133			1
’ the committee recommended a minister for complaints should be introduced , along with a dedicated unit to deal with grievances about government agencies			0
its report , more complaints please , found public sector managers viewed complaints as ‘ hostile criticism ’ rather than a chance to tackle problems			0
mps called for a culture where complaints are valued and suggested the @entity242 work with high performing private sector companies to find the best ways of dealing with the issue			1
the committee also attacked the public sector for using euphemistic words such as ‘ feedback ’ instead of ‘ complaint ’ , saying they give the impression that concerns are not being taken on board			0
last night @entity182 said : ‘ the findings present an opportunity for organisations to deal more effectively with complaints and develop ways to learn from those mistakes			0
‘ good complaint handling has to start from the top , and strong leaders will recognise the valuable opportunities complaints provide to really improve			0
’ which ? executive director @entity266 said : ‘ it ’s essential for better public services that the government makes it easier and more effective for people to complain			0
‘ giving people a single point of contact and having a minister who is responsible should give people more confidence that complaints do count			0
’ the report by @entity182 , left , echoed some of the concerns of @entity190 's earlier review , right			0
