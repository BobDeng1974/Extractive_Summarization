the pair got into a vicious fight over fishing rights in the river when one managed to catch a salmon , while the other was left empty handed			2
but rather than try to catch its own food , the bear tried to steal the fish straight from its rival 's jaws			0
face - off : the two bears stand on their hind legs as they square up to one another over the salmon fighting pose : the defending bear continues to hold the fish tightly in its teeth as it stares at the aggressor give it to me ! the brown bear lunges at the freshly caught salmon in the river in @entity3 but the defending bear would not give its snack away quite so easily and the two began to fight over the fresh water fish			1
the confrontation was spotted in @entity36 , @entity3 , by @entity38 photographer @entity37			1
the 36 - year - old said the battle was especially fierce as the two bears were of equal size			0
the pair were pictured sizing each other up as they stood on their hind legs before the wrestling in the water and hitting each other with their giant paws			0
mr @entity37 said : ' the two bears seemed ready to fight ferociously for rights to the fish			1
powerful : the two bears show their brute strength as they scrap over the salmon grapple : photographer @entity37 said the confrontation was compelling because the two bears were equally matched @entity54 : the defending bear managed to hold off the attack and keep the salmon it had caught ' when they fought it was a stunning scene , it did n't last very long but it felt like it lasted much longer			1
' one thing i have learned about bear behaviour is that they only fight with similar sized bears , if there is a clear size difference , the smaller one always surrenders and flees the scene			0
' this was an especially interesting moment as they were almost equal but inevitably one of the bears had to surrender and leave without a salmon			0
' @entity3 is home to all three species of @entity38 bear - the brown , black and polar bears			2
the state contains about 98 per cent of the @entity38 brown bear population with an estimated 30,000 individuals .			0
