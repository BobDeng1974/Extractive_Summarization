they are the equivalent height of a 90 - storey building			2
but these @entity4 power grid workers do n't seem too fazed by the dizzying heights of the world 's tallest pylons			1
the men are required to work at a height of 885ft ( 270 metres ) as they install a crossing tower for a new line of ultra high voltage cable stretching from @entity14 province to @entity16 - a distance of 268 miles			2
the tower is just one of 1,421 starting west from @entity19			0
the men have until the end of 2013 to finish the ambitious project			0
the project is due to be finished next year stiff neck : the @entity4 men are working at a height of 885ft - the equivalent of a 90 - storey building by comparison : @entity39 , left , is 316ft high while the @entity41 's tallest pylons are a mere 164ft in comparison to @entity4 's monster towers the workers are strapped into safety harnesses but use flimsy rope ladders to go up and down the pylons			1
more than 500billion kwh of electricity per year will travel along the cables			0
the workers have now reached the most important section across the @entity53			0
long journey : driving the route of the proposed pylons would take around six hours terrifying : the men all wear safety harnesses but go up and down the pylon on flimsy rope ladders vital power source : more than 500billion kwh of electricity per year will travel along the cables			1

the @entity41 's tallest pylons are a mere 164ft while @entity39 is 316ft
