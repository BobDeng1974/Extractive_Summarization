confusing : millions are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system , the government warned today the government wants to strip out red tape that makes it hard for workers to transfer their pensions throughout their careers into one pension			2
mr @entity7 said he wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to ' grow big fat pension pots '			1
he said : ' i am concerned that people are at risk of losing their small pension pots as they move from job to job			2
