five - month - old @entity5 , pictured with parents @entity16 and @entity17 , is believed to be the youngest ever person to undergo open heart surgery , just 30 minutes after she was born @entity5 was born hypoplastic left - heart syndrome , meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side of her heart was severely underdeveloped and did not work			1
the life - threatening condition was detected during mrs @entity5 's 20 - week scan and doctors also discovered she had an ' intact septum ' meaning the top two chambers of her heart were fully closed.without surgery , @entity5 would not survive after birth			1
when she was born weighing 7lbs 5oz on july 16th this year by caesarean section , mrs @entity5 , 31 , and husband @entity17 , 29 , a process operator at a factory , only managed to get a quick glimpse of their daughter before she was whisked away immediately for surgery			2
@entity5 was born hypoplastic left - heart syndrome , meaning she essentially had half a heart as the left side was severely underdeveloped and did not work dr @entity42 performed the delicate operation on @entity5 , whose heart was the size of a walnut , in an open heart procedure known as an atrial septostomy			1
the top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open and operation enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven - hour long open heart procedure at ten days old			1
at one point , her parents , who live in @entity13 , were told their daughter 's chances of survival were ' very small ' and feared she might not make it			0
but after nine operations in total , including the two open heart surgeries , @entity5 is battling back and is getting used to life at home			1
mrs @entity5 , a computer technician at @entity64 , said : ' after @entity5 was born , i literally heard her cry and she was whisked away to be operated on			2
now , after nine operations , including the two open heart surgeries , @entity5 is getting used to life at home ' i just wanted to grab hold of her and keep her safe but i knew that she urgently needed the surgery			1
' we 've been told she 's probably the youngest ever to have open heart surgery			1
' without the staff and surgeons at the hospital , @entity5 would n't be here today			2
we ca n't thank them enough , they are brilliant			0
' it 's her first @entity4 and it 's so special			0
we did n't know if she 'd even be here at this point			0
' we did n't know whether to buy many presents at first because we were n't sure if she 'd get to come home , but @entity5 has a lot of gifts now , from us and friends			2
' we managed to get the christmas tree up for her too so we 're really looking forward to it			0
' looking at her now , it 's hard to believe that she 's been through so much and we are so grateful to the @entity90 at the @entity91			0
' during surgery , the top two chambers of her tiny heart were cut open			2
this enabled her to survive long enough to have her next seven - hour long open heart procedure at ten days old @entity5 will also need a heart transplant when she is ten mrs @entity5 was unable to be by her daughter 's side immediately after the birth because the @entity91 does not have a maternity unit and spent an agonising night at the @entity102 awaiting news about whether the operation had been a success			1
she said : ' it was very scary not being there with her or knowing what was going on			0
' although we knew from a very early stage in my pregnancy that @entity5 would be poorly , we did n't know exactly what would be wrong with her			2
' normally babies have surgery where a balloon is inserted through the veins and it opens up the heart , but @entity5 had to have open heart surgery			1
' the doctors could n't tell us what would happen because it all depended on how she reacted and if she could cope , but the surgeon let me know as soon as possible that @entity5 had made it			0
' following the second surgery , @entity5 's sternum was left open and covered with a plastic film and it was eventually closed when she was three and a half weeks old			1
she also met a special visitor during her final few days at the @entity12			0
ex-newcastle @entity130 striker @entity129 has recently become patron of the @entity90 charity her mother added : ' you could see her little heart beating underneath the film which was a little scary , but she needed it to survive			0

she had her last operation , a tracheostomy , at six weeks and one day old , to help her breathe			0
