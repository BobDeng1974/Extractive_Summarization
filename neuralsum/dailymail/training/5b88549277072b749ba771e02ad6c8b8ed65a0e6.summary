grilled : @entity0 was repeatedly asked about her children back home she was delighted to be part of the @entity5 team sent out to @entity6 to cover the @entity8 football tournament			1
but @entity0 was annoyed to be repeatedly asked : ‘ who ’s looking after your children ? ’ her nine - year - old twins @entity13 and @entity14 were left at home with their father , former @entity17 rugby star @entity16 , 42 , while mrs @entity0 , 41 , was working in @entity6			1
and despite admitting she was relieved when @entity18 were knocked out because it meant she could go back to being a mother , mrs @entity0 expressed surprise that people still think a woman ’s place is in the home			1
in a new interview she said : ‘ people still think it ’s a woman ’s responsibility to organise everything			0
when i was away , some of the mums at school asked @entity16 how he was coping			2
' no one asked me that when he was working in @entity33 last year			2
i ’m often asked who ’s looking after the children when i ’m away , yet my male colleagues are n’t			2
’ mrs @entity0 went on to admit she was secretly pleased to be leaving @entity6 when the @entity18 football team were knocked out			1
the former gymnast , who also presented at the @entity39 , said : ‘ @entity18 ’s early exit from the @entity8 was a silver lining because i could go home to see my kids			2
' it was good to get back into a routine again , although @entity14 assumes the role of the woman of the house when i ’m away , and she was a bit put out on my first day back			1
she said , “ oh , @entity53 , i missed you ” , but it was like she felt she had to say it ! ’ of course , there may be another reason mrs @entity0 was glad to be home , after tweeting and blogging about the poor standard of the hotel she was staying in			1
she posted a photograph of her room ’s faulty hairdryer on social networking site @entity64 , while moaning on her blog that the laundry service had misplaced some of her clothes			0
and she was miffed one night when she found the burger bar she wanted to eat dinner in was closed for a private event			0
but @entity13 and @entity14 would not have known about their mother ’s complaints – neither of them are interested in social media			1
mrs @entity0 told @entity77 : ‘ i ’m mindful of my children being exposed to the internet as they ’re getting older			1
you worry about what they ’re going to find			0
they know about @entity64 and @entity83 , but they ’re not interested at the moment			0
at the time the corporation faced criticism over the size of the line - up , while others thought there should be more women on the team			0
but mrs @entity0 said she did n’t see the point in sending more females ‘ for the sake of it ’			1
she said : ‘ there was an outcry when the @entity5 unveiled their line - up for the @entity8 and i was the only woman			0
but there were no gaps on the presenting team			0
' if you ’ve got someone like @entity114 doing his job brilliantly , why should the @entity5 push him out and put a woman in for the sake of it ? it happens in other industries , not just football			0
there are n’t enough women at the top in science , in boardrooms , or in the @entity126			0
’ as it happened , mrs @entity0 emerged as the @entity5 ’s top performer , as her male colleagues faced abuse			1
reflecting on public reaction to her calm presenting style , which she has previously said is down to doing yoga , she said : ‘ i just wonder whether i ’ve weeded out the idiots or blocked them all , but during the @entity8 i received lots of positive comments for the first time			0
' there were a few people who tweeted that i ’d asked the wrong question in an interview , which is fair enough , but it was n’t comments about my looks or genitalia i ’m glad to say			2

mrs @entity0 was *constantly* asked about twins @entity13 and @entity14 while away
mums back home asked her rugby player *husband* how he copes alone
observed that neither of these things apply when roles are *reversed*
