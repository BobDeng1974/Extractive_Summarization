the posting added : ' sadly , @entity14 doesnt hold up to the sort of advanced , high levels of scrutiny people are subjected to these days			1
it 's not us doing this , it 's celebrity - obsessed media culture			2
' challenge : @entity14 says she is asserting her legal rights and @entity5 have refused to remove the offending picture @entity42 , based in @entity43 , and @entity14 say they have tried and failed to get @entity5 to take down the picture - so they took out a copyright suit against the company on december 31 , 2013			1
