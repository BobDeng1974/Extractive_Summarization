by @entity0 , political editor published : 08:53 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 18:30 est , 16 october 2012 @entity2 ’s top law officer yesterday paved the way for new inquests to be held into the 96 deaths at @entity6			1
attorney general @entity7 said he was taking the ‘ exceptional ’ step of applying to the @entity9 to have the original verdicts of accidental death quashed			1
his announcement came after a report into the 1989 disaster revealed last month that 41 fans could have been saved if the response of emergency services had been swifter			2
ninety - six @entity19 fans died in the crush at the @entity6 ground in @entity22 , but only this year has new evidence confirmed the need for fresh inquests it also revealed a vast cover - up by police and paramedics designed to blame @entity19 fans for the tragedy			1
families of the victims hope new inquests will record verdicts of corporate manslaughter			1
mr @entity36 said he was still considering the new evidence , but would apply for fresh inquests to be held on the basis of what he has already read			1
he said he was making the announcement early to ease the ‘ anxiety ’ of victims ’ families			0
‘ my view is that i will apply to have every one of those 96 inquests quashed , ’ he told @entity44			1
‘ i believe that these deaths , arising as they do from a common chain of events , should all be considered afresh			0
’ it was clear there were ‘ significant issues over the original inquest ’ , he added			0
but he admitted the new legal process ‘ will take some time ’ and acknowledged that ‘ the wait for truth and justice has been long and unspeakably painful for a great many people ’			1
attorney general @entity36 said he would go to the @entity9 to quash the original 96 inquests into the deaths of the @entity19 fans killed in the @entity6 tragedy the report into the @entity6 disaster , headed by the @entity64 , rejected the findings of the original inquests that no lives could have been saved after 3.15pm on the day			1
@entity68 , whose son @entity69 , 27 , was killed , said : ‘ i ’m highly delighted			0
we want the accidental death verdicts quashed so we can get manslaughter verdicts			1
‘ i have spoken to different families over the weekend			0
that seems to be the opinion and it is what i would want as well – corporate manslaughter and manslaughter verdicts			2
‘ ninety - six people ca n’t die and hundreds injured without someone being held responsible			0
‘ the truth , in my opinion , is finally coming out , i ’m very pleased			0
we want to see justice			2
if that means police officers have to stand trial , well they should stand trial in a criminal court			0
’ mrs @entity92 , who lives near @entity93 , @entity94 , added that she hoped any new inquests would be held in @entity19			1
former labour justice secretary @entity96 , who has advised the victims ’ families , said @entity99 had made a ‘ huge difference ’ to the campaign			2
‘ you have a government , led by a prime minister , saying , “ this is a huge injustice , let ’s sort it out ” – and that makes a real difference , ’ he said			0
@entity19 mp @entity109 said the move ‘ marks one of the biggest steps forward in the fight for justice for the families in 23 years ’			1
@entity19 fans have spent 23 years campaigning for justice , including new inquests into the events of april 15 1989 ‘ the undeniable fact is that the original inquest was unsound and this application , if successful , will mean that evidence will be able to be heard after the 3.15pm cut off imposed by the original coroner in the 1989 inquests , ’ he added			1
‘ for the first time in over two decades , all the evidence can now be reviewed into the disaster and potentially a new verdict recorded on the death certificates of the deceased			2
‘ at long last , the full horror of @entity6 will be on the public record alongside the names of the people and the organisations that are accountable for what happened			0
’ he went on : ‘ the families ’ heartache has been well documented but what is less well known is that some families have refused to pick up the death certificates of their loved ones who died on that day			2
’ last month ’s report concluded police officers had tried to smear the dead by checking them for criminal records and medics had tried to prove they were drunk			0
hundreds of statements were doctored to remove criticism of the authorities .			0

@entity36 takes ' exceptional step ' to confirm he will have the 96 verdicts of accidental death *overturned*
@entity19 mp @entity109 says move is one of the biggest steps in the fight for justice for 23 years
