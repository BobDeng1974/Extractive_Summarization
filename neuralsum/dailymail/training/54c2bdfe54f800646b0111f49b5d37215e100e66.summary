i think i should go home to my bed and my toys			1
’ @entity20 , 37 , and father @entity21 , 36 , have spoken of the proud moment their son , @entity22 , revealed his dying wish - that they make other children smile when he was gone his parents @entity28 , 37 , and @entity29 , 36 , from @entity30 , had been agonising over how long to continue treatment after being told it was in vain - until brave @entity22 made the decision for them			1
he even refused to open toys , knowing he would not get the chance to play with them , and insisted they be given to the hospital instead			2
to fulfil @entity22 's dying wish , his parents have now set up a trust to spread joy in his name			1
dubbed @entity45 , it has already brought cheer to other youngsters battling cancer			1
' @entity22 wanted to be like @entity49 and @entity14 but he was far more amazing than both of them put together , ' said mrs @entity20 , a teaching assistant			2
@entity22 's dying wish for his parents to make other sick children happy means they have now set up a trust to spread joy in his name named @entity45 the youngster , who always dressed as @entity14 or @entity56 , had battled a rare cancer called neuroblastoma ‘ he was a real life superhero who , despite his own illness , went out of his way to make all the other poorly children smile			1
‘ @entity22 always had a smile for everyone and his dying wish was for us to make other children smile too			1
saying goodbye to our superhero broke our hearts but fulfilling his dying wish to spread happiness and joy keeps us going			1
‘ @entity22 ’s cancer was missed many times but we refuse to be bitter or angry because ultimately we just feel so lucky to have had such an amazing little boy			1
’ mrs @entity20 and her husband @entity21 , a development and design manager , had feared they could not have a baby after four years of trying and were looking into adoption when @entity28 learned she was expecting @entity22 whom she describes as being her ‘ miracle			1
’ @entity82 explained that while the family had been dealt a terrible blow , @entity22 would organise fun for everyone and make them all laugh and giggle his parents say he was a real life superhero who , despite his own illness , went out of his way to make all the other poorly children smile ‘ we felt like the luckiest parents alive , ' she recalls			1
' @entity22 was such an easy going loveable baby			2
people would stop me in the street to tell me how gorgeous his big smile was			2
’ but when @entity22 fell ill as a toddler , mrs @entity20 , initially told it was nothing to worry about , was left devastated when a stage four neuroblastoma was diagnosed			1
‘ we just put our arms around each other and sobbed , ' says the grieving mother			2
' he was given a 20 per cent chance of survival and like any parent in that situation , we prayed he would be in that 20 per cent			2
’ the next day , the little boy started chemotherapy to shrink tumours in his tummy and liver			2
but far from being miserable , happy @entity22 treated it all as one great big adventure			2
when doctors came to listen to his heart , he ’d roar like a lion to make them laugh and then high five the nurses			2
speaking about her son , @entity82 said : ' what he was doing was incredible and we just hoped that he had the power to fight the cancer as well as making everyone laugh and smile ' they decided his funeral should be a celebration of his life with a @entity56 casket pulled by @entity131 @entity22 was carried in a @entity56 casket because of his love of superheroes dressed in one of his favourite superhero costumes , he ’d stroll around the ward giving out ‘ @entity22 hugs ’ to cheer up all the other sick children			1
just after his third birthday , he had two operations to remove the tumours followed by more chemotherapy			2
he even kept smiling even when his hair fell out but after just a few months , the cancer returned once more			1
to his parents it was a huge blow but @entity22 took it in his stride and when he was admitted to hospital over @entity150 he organised an egg and spoon race for the other young patients			0
‘ that was typical , ' says mrs @entity20			0

' he started wearing it around the ward and became known as @entity22			0
what he was doing was incredible and we just hoped that he had the power to fight the cancer as well as making everyone laugh and smile			1

' this was how @entity22 wanted to spend his time and as heartbreaking as it was for us as parents , those were his wishes , ' she said that ’s when consultants called @entity28 and @entity21 into a side room and broke the devastating news that @entity22 might have as little as six weeks left			1
' we were floored , ' says mrs @entity20			0
' i begged them to try and save him			0
she told me she would do her best because the whole ward loved @entity22			0
' i was so moved but still struggled to take it in			0
’ but @entity22 had other ideas			0
the next day , he asked his mother to nip out for while			0
while she was gone , @entity22 took all the @entity210 from the playroom and turned his room into a mini @entity213			0
‘ when i got back there was @entity210 everywhere , ' she says			0
' he ’d even drawn paper tickets and gave them out to all the other children on the ward and invited them to come and visit @entity213			1
’ but later that day as he slept , one of his regular nurses came in to check on him and emotional mrs @entity20 turned to her for advice			0
‘ i asked her how we would know when it was time to stop the treatment now he was terminal			1
but as she went to open her mouth to answer i heard a little voice and it was @entity22			0
‘ he just looked up at me and said : " mummy it is n’t going to work			0
i think i should go home to my bed and my toys			1
" ' my heart was literally breaking in half as he spoke but deep down i knew he was right			0
he may have only been four years old but he was telling me what he wanted			1
' this was how @entity22 wanted to spend his time and as heartbreaking as it was for us as parents , those were his wishes			0
’ his parents wasted no time in fulfilling @entity22 's wish that they spread happiness by helping other children by setting up the @entity245 the following day the couple took him home but mrs @entity20 , conscious that time was running out , was desperate for @entity22 to enjoy one last @entity247			1
' so in october 2013 , friends turned the family ’s garden into a winter wonderland complete with @entity247 , presents and even horses dressed as reindeer			0
‘ @entity22 was weak but his face lit up , ' says his mother			0
' only when he saw the pile of presents he did n’t want to open them : ' he said : " it ’s ok mummy and daddy			0
my friends will play with them			0
you need to help the other children now "			1
‘ we looked at each other because he was telling us he knew he was never going to play with those toys and he was telling us wanted he wanted us to do			0
’ three days later , the youngster died peacefully on the sofa at home while holding his parents ’ hands			2
they decided his funeral should be a celebration of his life with a @entity56 casket pulled by @entity131			2
and they wasted no time in fulfilling @entity22 ’s wish that they spread happiness by helping other children by setting up the @entity245			1
