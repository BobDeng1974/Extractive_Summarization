@entity1 mp @entity0 was ' ballistic ' over motion @entity2 should be allowed to vary 24 - week upper limit as part of devolving powers to @entity7 @entity8 has been caught up in a furious @entity1 row over plans to let @entity2 decide its own abortion laws			1
the proposal is outlined in the cross-party @entity14 report on devolving powers to @entity7 drawn up in the wake of the ‘ no ’ vote in september ’s referendum on @entity2 independence			1
but the suggestion that @entity2 should be allowed to vary the current 24 - week ‘ upper limit ’ for terminating pregnancies sparked a blazing row at last week ’s shadow cabinet meeting			1
senior frontbencher @entity0 , who has opposed a reduction in the abortion time limit , led calls for the proposals to be thrown out			2
witnesses said the @entity30 banged the table and hit out at the male - dominated @entity14 who were drawing up the plans			2
she said : ‘ this is outrageous			0
what we ’ve got is a bunch of men deciding on women ’s rights to abortion			0
’ pro-abortion activists fear that @entity2 , with its strong @entity43 tradition , could insist on its abortion regime being tightened if given the chance			1
they fear this in turn could lead to @entity2 women travelling to @entity49 for terminations			2
a @entity1 source said there was ‘ panic ’ at the behind - closed - doors @entity55 meeting when they were told the @entity14 was poised to recommend handing over the abortion powers			1
one said : ‘ several people went ballistic – it was n’t just @entity0			0
’ the source said that ms @entity0 , mp for @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity65 , was only placated when she was promised that the final @entity14 report would be ‘ watered down ’			1
the report – agreed after the meeting – still called for ‘ serious consideration ’ of the plan			0
but a @entity1 insider said : ‘ this has effectively been kicked into the long grass			0
’ last week ’s row came against the backdrop of @entity8 ’s party finding itself under huge pressure from a rampant @entity78 and amid dire predictions that @entity1 could to lose as many as 37 of its 41 @entity2 seats at @entity81 in next @entity82 .			0
