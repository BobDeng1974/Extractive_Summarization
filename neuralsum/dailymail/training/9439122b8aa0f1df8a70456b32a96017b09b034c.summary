by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 11:24 est , 9 may 2012 a beauty queen known as the real @entity2 is shaking up the high - octane world of drag racing with her bright pink super-charged drag car			1
piston head @entity6 , 18 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , competed to be miss @entity9 but now hopes to become the only woman in @entity12 to hit 330mph on four wheels			1
and while most teenagers are lucky to get a normal driving licence and buy a modest - engined small car , @entity6 can drive a 2000 horse - power dragster , capable of 0 - 100mph in a staggering 1.09secs - consistently hitting 200 mph			1
scroll down to see her racing determined : the 18 - year - old has been racing for years and hopes to be the only woman in @entity12 to compete at the top level - where dragsters hit at least 300 mph miss @entity6 's pride and joy is her own bright - pink 200mph race car , aptly called @entity26 , adding a touch of glamour to what is primarily a male - dominated sport			1
' my dad @entity32 was a car champion in 1993 , the year i was born			0
he then took me down to the track to watch when i was three or four and i was hooked , ' she told @entity35			0
when asked if she is the real - life @entity2 , she said : ' i suppose			0
my pink car stands out and it means that people know it is a girl driving			2
iconic : teenage drag racer @entity6 , with her @entity26 car , is a proud beauty queen as well as an outstanding sportswoman talented : miss @entity6 , pictured centre looking at the camera , competed in miss @entity9 coming in a respectable fifth in a semi-final icon : miss @entity6 has been compared to glamorous cartoon character @entity2 , from @entity48 ' it also makes a strong statement that women can drive just as well as men			1
' i absolutely disagree that being a beauty contestant and a drag racer do n't match			0
nobody should be judged just by their looks and i have proved myself in the sport			0
drag racing is aggressive but i have shown i can still do it my own way			2
' but as if piloting a 200mph car was not enough for her , she decided to enter the @entity9 competition in 2011 after securing sponsorship from @entity67 in @entity68			2
in the blood : @entity6 pictured at four watching her champion father @entity71 race pedigree : @entity6 , then aged 10 , with a junior stock car in the driveway of her home in @entity7 , @entity8 coming a respectable fifth in the semi-finals , @entity6 was the only entrant to take to the catwalk in her fire retardant boots			1
' i was scouted in @entity8 , competing against nurses and other professionals and i came in fifth			0
i 'm very proud of representing my sport there because most had never heard of it because it is male dominated			0
' in my racing class there are two other women and in the top class , where they go 300 mph , there are none			1
that is where i want to be next			0

@entity6 , 18 , competed in @entity9 but is also one of drag racing 's top *female* drivers
her car ' @entity26 ' hits 200 mph but her aim is to break the 300 mph *barrier*
' my pink car is a statement showing that women can drive just as well as men , ' she says
@entity6 was the only miss @entity9 entrant to take to the catwalk in her fire retardant boots
