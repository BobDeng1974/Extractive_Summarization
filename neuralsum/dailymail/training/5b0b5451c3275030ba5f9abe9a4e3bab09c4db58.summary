relations between @entity1 and the @entity2 were under growing strain last night as @entity4 responded to speculation about @entity7 ’s leadership ambitions by suggesting he ignored such ‘ rubbish ’			1
the prime minister used a tv broadcast to say that he was not concerned about being a ‘ popular guy ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s so vital that you look to the horizon and not tomorrow ’s headlines , because there is a sort of daily battle of this story and that event			2
‘ it ’s all rubbish			2
what matters is : are you taking the right long - term decisions for the good of the country ? ’ death stare : @entity4 has dismissed the idea that @entity7 is positioning herself as his successor his remarks were widely seen as reference to two weeks of stories claiming mrs may is positioning herself to succeed him			1
for the second week running at @entity9 ’s questions , @entity35 leader @entity34 attempted to taunt mr @entity4 over the swirling rumours – saying the prime minister had been ‘ overruled ’ by the home secretary on the issue of a minimum price for alcohol			1
mrs may , who is hailed as @entity45 ’s answer to @entity46 by her allies , responded with what is becoming a trademark ‘ death stare ’			2
unusually , she did not take her seat on the @entity53 front bench for prime minister ’s questions , instead watching proceedings from a position alongside the speaker ’s chair			0
not concerned : the prime minister has said he does not want to be the ' popular guy ' in the eyes of the press the home secretary ’s allies are infuriated by charges of disloyalty , insisting a weekend speech ranging far beyond her brief which was interpreted as paving the way for a future leadership bid was cleared personally in advance by mr @entity4			1
they were outraged by a leak from tuesday ’s political @entity75 revealing that she had been admonished by name by education secretary @entity78			0
@entity1 was forced to disown a report claiming that mr @entity4 had ‘ long nurtured doubts about @entity7 ’s effectiveness as home secretary ’ , insisting he had always regarded her as ‘ first class ’			1
‘ say what you want about how sparkly or otherwise she is , she has been effective and even her enemies would concede that			0
this just makes them sound on another planet ’ said one supporter of mrs may			0
but her camp was further enraged by @entity96 political editor @entity95 quoting people close to the prime minister as branding the home secretary ‘ grotesquely naïve ’			0
members of the prime minister ’s inner circle , meanwhile , said they suspected the @entity2 had leaked the fact that it has killed off the prime minister ’s plan to impose a 45p per unit minimum price for alcohol			0
mrs may and other ministers , including her @entity109 deputy @entity109 and commons leader @entity110 – had suggested the move would be politically suicidal at a time when the cost of living is already rising			0
some of the home secretary ’s colleagues agree that she has overstepped the mark , though her allies have made clear she would do nothing to challenge mr @entity4 and would only consider a leadership run if he quit after losing the next election .			1

@entity4 said he does *n't* need to be popular in the eyes of the press
he added that his only concern is the interests of the country long term
this follows weeks of stories saying the may is positioning to succeed him
