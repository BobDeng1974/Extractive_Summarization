for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			1
in his new book ' a man walks on to a pitch ' - serialised exclusively by @entity8 this week - @entity0 reveals the ways in which @entity11 introduced new coaching techniques into the @entity13			1
the arrival of @entity11 in 1996 certainly heralded a change in @entity17 football			1
he was very successful very quickly , and suddenly all the talk was about his revolutionary new training methods			2
he only trains for an hour … does everything on the stopwatch … the players are wearing heart monitors at training … he gives them supplements … @entity26 is one of the biggest changes			2
last season , when @entity29 were due to play @entity30 , our most recent scout ’s report had them operating with four at the back and two holding midfield players			2
in the old days , that would have been all that was available			2
so we knew that for most of the season they had played three centre - halves , and pushed the full - backs on and that would be how they intended to play if everyone was fit			2
the aids for a manager are incredible now			0
when i began , we might have one report on the opposition			0
that aside , you just played - sorted your own team out and went from there			0
if they had a player you fancied was good you might tell one of the lads to watch him , give him an idea of what to expect - but there was no detail			0
@entity100 at @entity101 was the only one who went into depth , and his dossiers were the talk of football			0
@entity26 , which uses player and team stats , and modern technologies were introduced into @entity17 football @entity11 used stop watches and other methods in order to ensure he got the maximum out of his players @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 make @entity0 's modern era @entity119 @entity120 would have solved @entity122 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 make @entity0 's early era @entity119 @entity128 has the class of @entity130 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity133 and @entity124 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity17 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity133 nearly crossed @entity139 to join @entity140 ... and @entity141 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity13 killed all that ! @entity8 's @entity148 interviews @entity0 about his new book other managers were still not convinced they were a good idea			1
play your own game , that was the mantra			1
no managers changed their team to accommodate the opposition			1
these days , if the @entity122 manager is caught out tactically he gets slaughtered ; but , even a few years before the @entity13 , if the same man came in and said the other team were using wing - backs so he would go with a back three too , and flood midfield , he would have been called a coward			1
why are we worrying about them ? we ’re @entity122 - let them worry about us ! i must admit , i find the point of @entity170 at times			0
yes , you ’ve got it - but so has the team you are playing			0
so while you ’re watching them , they ’re watching you , and while you ’re changing to deal with them , they ’re doing the same			0
we all go along with it , but where ’s the edge ? @entity122 players , like @entity182 , now use heart monitors and other technologies in training @entity0 ( right ) utilised new techniques at @entity45 after seeing @entity11 's methods pay dividends the front cover of @entity0 's new book , ' a man walks on to a pitch ' , which goes on sale on thursday ' a man walks on to a pitch ' by @entity0 is published by @entity197 , priced £ 20			1
