breastfeeding has been shown to have many health benefits , for mother and baby - and @entity4 is pleased and proud she was able to breastfeed all three of her children			1
yet two years ago , breastfeeding her third baby left @entity4 , 34 , suffering from a condition that nearly killed her			1
she 'd developed mastitis , which affects one in ten breastfeeding women and occurs when a milk duct , which transports milk to the nipple , becomes blocked			1
milk builds up in the breast , leading to painful inflammation			1
@entity4 got mastitis so bad when she breastfed her third child ( r ) she nearly died			1
pictured with sons @entity17 , five , and @entity19 , two there are 15 to 20 milk ducts in each breast - these can become blocked for a number of reasons , such as the baby not latching on properly and draining the breast effectively , or feeding irregularly			1
it can also be caused by pressure from a bra that 's too tight			2
often , the condition clears up on its own - if the mother continues breastfeeding , this helps to drain the breast , clear the blockage and the problem resolves			1
however , for some women the stagnant milk becomes infected , causing flu - like symptoms such as aches and shivers			1
this may happen because bacteria enter the breast through a small crack or break in the skin , or as a result of bacteria in the baby 's mouth and throat entering during breastfeeding			2
in this case , a course of antibiotics is required to clear the infection - mothers can take a type that is safe for babies , allowing them to keep breastfeeding			2
@entity4 knows these symptoms well - she had mastitis with her first child , @entity61 , now 15 , and her second , @entity17 , now five			1
' both times i 'd got pain , then a hardening of the breast , followed by aches and feeling rotten , ' says @entity4 , a self - employed @entity69 who lives with her partner and children in @entity73 , @entity74			1
' i saw my gp and was given antibiotics , which cleared it up within a few days			2
' the bacteria that had caused the mastitis had spread to her bloodstream so when @entity4 had her third child , @entity19 , now two , and started feeling unwell , she knew what was wrong			1
' when @entity19 was eight weeks old , i got the familiar pain in my left breast - then i started to ache and feel as if i was coming down with flu			1
i knew without a doubt this was mastitis again			2
' she called her gp and , because of her history , the doctor gave @entity4 antibiotics straight away			1
but whereas with her first two children the medicine worked quickly , this time it did not			2
' over the next two days the pain in my left breast got worse			0
it was also like the worst flu ever - i was hot , then cold , then dizzy and the aches felt like i 'd been kicked			1
i lay and shivered beneath a blanket			0
' luckily , her partner @entity101 , 44 , an accountant , was able to help look after the other children			0
despite her condition , @entity4 was keen to continue breastfeeding			1
' i 'd read lots about mastitis and knew the best way to clear a blockage was to keep on feeding , ' she says			2
however , three days after the mastitis began , with @entity101 out , @entity4 's condition worsened dramatically			1
' i started feeling breathless and lay down in bed , but suddenly the room went black			0
i was slipping in and out of consciousness			0
' her quick - thinking daughter , then just 13 , grabbed a thermometer and took her mother 's temperature - it was 41c			2
in one moment of lucidity , @entity4 grabbed the phone and called her doctor , who told her to get to @entity125			1
@entity101 hurried home and stayed with the other children			0
@entity4 managed to climb into a taxi			1
not wanting to be parted from @entity19 , she took him with her to @entity129			0
by the time she arrived , she could barely string a sentence together and was hallucinating			0
she recalls hearing the consultant talk to another doctor and mentioning the word ' sepsis '			0
i knew this was very serious , ' she says			0
@entity4 was raced down to a high - dependency ward and attached to wires to monitor her heart , with a drip inserted for fluids			1
she was also given two sets of intravenous antibiotics			0
blood tests confirmed @entity4 had sepsis - blood poisoning			1
the bacteria that had caused the mastitis had spread to her bloodstream			2
for two days , @entity4 battled for her life after being diagnosed with sepsis - blood poisoning less than 1 per cent of cases of mastitis lead to sepsis , says dr @entity156 , a critical care consultant and chief executive of the @entity159			1
when sepsis occurs , the body 's immune system sets off a series of reactions , including inflammation , swelling and blood clotting , which can mean the blood supply to vital organs is cut off			1
if it is n't treated quickly , sepsis can lead to organ failure and ultimately death			0
' antibiotics are the single most important thing - if they 're delivered in the first hour , then that doubles your chance of survival , ' says dr @entity156			2
' but for every hour of delay , the risk of death increases by 8 per cent			0
' we estimate that 102,000 people get sepsis every year in the @entity186			0
out of that figure , 37,000 die			0
' sepsis is most likely to occur as a result of conditions such as pneumonia , gallbladder complications or urinary tract infections , which are generally more common than mastitis			2
for two days , @entity4 battled for her life , with distressed family and friends taking turns to sit with her and care for the baby			1
reduction in a woman 's risk of breast cancer if she breastfeeds her baby ' @entity19 was in his cot by my side , ' she says			0
' i remember looking at him , so small , and thinking that i had to live			0
' nurses held the baby to her breast so he could continue to be breastfed			0
finally , on the third day , she turned a corner			0
' a consultant came and smiled and told me that the antibiotics had cleared the sepsis			0
i was going to be all right			0
' after five days in hospital , @entity4 was allowed home with oral antibiotics			1
her breast was still sore , but she carried on breastfeeding			0
@entity19 is now a healthy , happy two - and - a - half - year - old			2
' the way i saw it , i was just unlucky that time , ' she says			0
' @entity223 was still the best food for my baby and i was n't going to let mastitis stop me doing that			2
' it 's not clear why some women get mastitis and others do n't , but women who have had it are prone to getting it again - possibly because of the way the mother is feeding			1
@entity4 wants to raise awareness among breastfeeding women of the dangers of mastitis to prevent the problem , mothers should ensure the baby is latched on properly and finishes the feed on each side ; mothers should also wear a comfortable bra , and get plenty of rest - lowered immunity can raise the risk			1
if a woman suspects she has mastitis , she should contact her gp immediately because of the risk of infection , and also the risk of an abscess developing , which may need to be drained			2
with help and support , the problem often resolves itself , says @entity259 , midwife and policy adviser for the @entity261			0
' if a woman develops any pain or lumps , hot showers or cold compresses can help			0
' also , at every feed , she should make sure the baby feeds from each side , to ensure the milk is drained properly			2
if it does not resolve , she needs to see a gp or a lactation consultant			0
' if flu - like symptoms develop , this can suggest an infection has developed and antibiotics are needed			1
however , women can continue to breastfeed , or express milk if it is too painful , she says			1
' as long as she is supported and gets advice , there is no reason to stop feeding			0
' @entity4 wants to raise awareness among breastfeeding women of the dangers of mastitis			1
' i 'd had it before and so was a bit complacent that it would just pass , ' she says			0
' i 'm so glad i got to hospital when i did or i might not be here now			0
