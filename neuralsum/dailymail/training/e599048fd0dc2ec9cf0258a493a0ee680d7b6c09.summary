by @entity0 and @entity1 - parkinson published : 07:56 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 11:30 est , 21 march 2012 the potential of a new airport in the @entity6 a step closer after mr @entity2 warned that @entity7 needed to ‘ confront the lack of airport capacity ’ in the @entity10 of @entity11			1
the government aviation review is currently looking at the project - dubbed ' @entity13 ' after @entity16 mayor @entity15			1
the £ 50billion airport would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually			1
mr @entity2 ’s comments are also set to anger environmentalists and fuel concerns that the government is softening on its opposition to the expansion of @entity17			1
the relaxation of planning law is seen as a sign of approval for a new airport to the east of @entity16 the £ 50billion airport would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually			1
mr @entity2 said : ' we 're the first @entity7 government to set out in a @entity33 the projects we are going to prioritise in the coming decade			1
' the roads , railways , clean energy and water , and broadband networks we need are all identified			1
' i also believe this country must confront the lack of airport capacity in the @entity10 of @entity11 - we can not cut ourselves off from the fastest growing cities in the world			1
' the transport secretary will set out @entity22 thinking later this summer			1
further investment is expected in @entity16 's transport system on top of what has already been done such as @entity51 ' we want to look at the opportunities for increasing the role of private investment in the road network , learning lessons from the water industry			1
' i confirm today that @entity58 will extend the @entity59 , adding to the electrification of the @entity62 rail route , by upgrading the @entity63 between @entity64 and @entity65 - and improving the @entity64 to @entity66 and @entity67 , and @entity64 to @entity69 lines			1
' for years , transport investment in the north of @entity11 was neglected			1
' we are working with our great cities to devolve decision - making powers - and we are striking a ground - breaking deal with @entity64 to support £ 1.2 billion in growth - enhancing infrastructure			1
speaking about changes in planning law , the chancellor said : ' of course , those projects succeeded because they were not killed off by the planning system			1
' you ca n't earn your future if you ca n't get planning permission			1
global businesses have diverted specific investments that would have created hundreds of jobs in some of the most deprived communities in @entity7 to countries like @entity89 and the @entity90 , because they could n't get planning permission here			1
' next week my @entity94 friends the @entity96 and the planning minister will publish the results of our overhaul of planning regulation			1
' we 're replacing 1,000 pages of guidance with just 50 pages			1
we 're introducing a presumption in favour of sustainable development ; ' while protecting our most precious environments			2
the new policy comes into effect when the @entity111 is published next tuesday			2
' this is the biggest reduction in business red tape ever undertaken			2
as a country , we also want to make the most of the @entity116 and @entity117			2
' some of the biggest events will be on a sunday			2
when millions of visitors come to @entity7 to see them , we do n't want to hang up a ' @entity122 ' sign			2
@entity123 vowed to protect the most precious parts of the @entity7 's countryside which could include areas such as the @entity127 ' so we will introduce legislation limited to relaxing the sunday trading laws for eight sundays only , starting on july 22			2
' @entity130 , spokesman for the @entity131 , said mr @entity2 's reference to protecting ' the most precious environments ' could spell bad news for the wider countryside			2
' from the chancellor 's words we fear the long - standing protection for the wider countryside will be abandoned			2
' that would mean that 55per cent of @entity11 countryside , including many locally loved green spaces , could be placed at the mercy of developers			2
' also extremely worrying is the suggestion that communities may not be given any time to ensure their local plans conform to the new framework			2
' this could leave more then one third of areas that do n't currently have a plan exposed to a crude ' presumption in favour of sustainable development '			2
' @entity158 's executive director @entity157 said : ' @entity2 says new planning rules will protect our most precious environments but unless they address the environmental challenges we all face , ministers will pave the way for a development free - for - all that will cost us all a fortune in the long run			0
' bringing in the changes will put local plans at risk and allow developers to ride roughshod over local communities			0
' determined : the @entity176 shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul , saying he wants a @entity180 - style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth accepting there would be ‘ costs and protests ’ , mr @entity123 shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul , saying he wants a @entity180 - style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth			1
he warned that failure to act would condemn @entity7 to being a second - rate nation			0
but his plans were quickly condemned by rural groups and green campaigners as a blueprint for ‘ disfiguring ’ the countryside that would damage the fabric of @entity7			0
in a speech at the @entity199 in @entity16 , the prime minister vowed to overcome what he called a ‘ failure of nerve ’ on planning			0
mr @entity123 rejected calls by groups such as the @entity206 to tear up its new @entity111 , due shortly , saying it would provide ‘ the biggest simplification of our bureaucratic , top - down planning laws in 60 years ’			0
he said the government would protect green belts and national parks , but added : ‘ we also urgently need to find places where we are prepared to allow significant new growth to happen			0
’ vowing to recreate a ‘ visionary plan ’ from 1944 to build new towns across the @entity10 , mr @entity123 said : ‘ the growth of our towns and cities has been held back by a planning system which has encouraged development of the wrong sort in the wrong places			0
’ he said places such as @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 were ‘ not perfect but popular ’ and the coalition would seek to build more towns that were ‘ green , planned , secure , with gardens , places to play and characterful houses , not just car - dominated concrete grids ’			0
mr @entity123 said the government would begin consulting later this year ‘ on how to apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth , in places people want to live ’			0
he added : ‘ we must get our planning system fit for purpose			0
it needs to be quick			0
it needs to be easier to use			0
and it needs to better support growth , jobs and homes			1
’ the prime minister said the government needed to be similarly ‘ bold ’ about air transport too			1
risking a fresh row with the @entity254 , who oppose all airport expansion in the @entity10 , he said : ‘ i ’m not blind to the need to increase airport capacity , particularly in the @entity10			1
‘ we need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel , not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere , in @entity264 , @entity265 or @entity266			0
’ the @entity267 have ruled out a third runway at @entity17 but mr @entity123 made warm noises about building a new international hub airport @entity271			1
‘ yes , this will be controversial			0
we will be bringing forward options in our aviation strategy which will include an examination of the pros and cons of a new airport in the @entity6			1
’ he praised @entity15 , saying he had ‘ done very well in driving forward this agenda ’			0
mr @entity123 also unveiled £ 150million of new investment in ‘ shovel ready ’ building projects that already have planning permission but are stalled by lack of investment			1
chancellor @entity2 will also be announcing ten ‘ super-connected ’ cities that are to have universal access to super-fast broadband as part of the drive to improve telecommunications			0
@entity291 , director of policy for the @entity131 , attacked the plans for building in the countryside			0
he said : ‘ if the government ’s planning reforms remain unchanged from the draft published last year , pressure for sprawling development is precisely what we can expect			0
‘ unless the final planning framework recognises the intrinsic value of our countryside as a whole , we fear a rash of sporadic and inappropriate development across the country , disfiguring the rural landscape which is so valued by local communities			0
’ but mr @entity123 vowed to stand up to the critics			0
‘ there will be costs and protests			0
and i am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage , ’ he said			0
‘ i can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already			0
’ but he added : ‘ we will take difficult decisions , we will risk short - term unpopularity			0
‘ we will hold fast to our vision in the face of vested interests , because our motivation and our duty is to protect and champion the national interest			0
