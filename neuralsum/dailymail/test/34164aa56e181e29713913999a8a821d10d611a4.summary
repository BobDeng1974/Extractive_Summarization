it 's not just @entity1 rays that suncreams now protect against - some new products claim to stop the damage from infra - red a rays , too			1
meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside			1
but are any of these high - tech suncreams worth buying ? here , dr @entity10 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity11 in @entity12 , offers his verdict			1
and we rate them ... a new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra - red a rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside			1
here , consultant dermatologist @entity10 gives his verdict dr @entity23 's @entity22 £ 11.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion , dr - @entity26 @entity27 : @entity29 30 suncream containing @entity30 and uvb protection , plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin e , lycopene , vitamin c , beta - carotene and other nutrients for skin health			1
@entity41 : ' a bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables			1
' there 's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage			1
' the suncream is ok , but it 's pretty standard			2
' 5/10 @entity57 , @entity29 30 £ 19.99 for 150ml spray , from boots and supermarkets @entity27 : first mainstream product to protect against infra - red a rays as well as @entity30 and @entity63			1
offers ' protection against four times more of the sun 's rays '			1
@entity41 : ' the effects of infra - red a rays on the skin is an emerging field of research			1
' a recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra - red a. ' i 'd plump for factor 50 rather than factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent			1
' you can get the same @entity30 and @entity63 protection from cheaper products			0
' 6/10 dr @entity23 's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots , while @entity88 is the first product to protect against infra - red a rays as well as @entity30 and uvb @entity92 , @entity29 30 £ 40 for 80ml , @entity94 stores @entity27 : this protects against @entity30 / @entity63 rays - it contains titanium oxide , oxtinoxate , benzophenone and organic red tea extract			1
developed by a @entity103 dermatologist , it is said to be the first over-the - counter sunscreen that is ' physician strength '			2
expert verdict : ' titanium oxide reflects @entity30 and uvb rays off the skin , while oxtinoxate absorbs uv rays and converts them to heat , so it does n't damage @entity111 - most good suncreams should contain these			1
' physician strength ' sounds impressive , but i 'm not sure what it means			0
' organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of uv exposure			2
' it 's expensive and i 'd opt for a factor 50 product			0
' 6/10 @entity122 is made from a avocado based ingredient , which ' aids development of the skin 's barrier @entity29 50 + £ 14.95 for 100ml , from independent pharmacies @entity27 : @entity129 ( a patented ingredient based on avocados , which have a high vitamin e content ) , aids development of the cutaneous ( skin ) barrier and preserves the wealth of cells in babies ' skin			2
@entity41 : ' this is easily absorbed and free of parabens ( preservatives ) and fragrance so would be good for a baby 's sensitive skin as it wo n't cause irritation			2
' children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing			0
' avocado oil is a good moisturiser , but it 's not clear how it ' aids the development of the cutaneous barrier '			0
' i 'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well			0
' 7/10 @entity156 £ 19.99 for 80g , larger branches of @entity158 and @entity159 and @entity160 @entity27 : for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at - risk patients ( e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system , such as transplant patients )			2
protects against @entity30 and @entity63			0
@entity41 : ' this product was tested for two years on immuno - suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers , because they take drugs which suppress the body 's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells			1
' patients who 've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use			0
' 8/10 @entity177 50 £ 2 for 50ml , from @entity177 stores @entity27 : a @entity30 and @entity63 sunscreen			0
@entity41 : ' this does what it says on the label			0
' it has the same @entity30 and uvb protection ingredients as other more expensive creams , plus it is water resistant , and easily absorbed			0
' 9/10 @entity156 aims to prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at - risk patients while @entity188 contains @entity30 and uvb protection , is water resistant and wo n't stain clothes @entity192 50 @entity193 50 £ 31 for 50ml , from @entity194 @entity27 : this is said to prevent photo ageing ( sun - induced skin damage ) and sun spots and contains a ' powerful stem cell stimulator ' ; also contains hyaluronic acid , zinc oxide , titanium oxide and aloe vera			1
@entity206 suncreams with @entity30 and @entity63 protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots			2
' hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin , but there 's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream			2
' it 's not clear what the ' stem cell stimulator ' is			0
' this is the @entity221 in skin care as it would reset the clock on skin cells , but i 'm not aware that anybody has managed to do this yet			0
' 6/10 @entity228 40 £ 17.99 for 150ml , from @entity229 , @entity230 , and @entity231 ( £ 7 from @entity232 ) @entity233 : @entity30 and uvb protection , it 's water resistant and wo n't stain clothes			0
@entity41 : ' this is ok for a school situation as children are mainly indoors			0
' @entity240 needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once - a - day panacea you might anticipate			0
