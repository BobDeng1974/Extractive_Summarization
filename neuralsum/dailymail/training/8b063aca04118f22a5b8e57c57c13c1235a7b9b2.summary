the audience did n't bother the bear			0
unwelcome guest : in this november 7 , 2014 photo provided by @entity0 , a black bear eats seeds inside a bird feeder on a second - floor porch after walking up a flight of stairs in @entity4 , @entity26 ' he 's like , " excuse me , i 'm having a little snack here , ' " @entity0 told the @entity28			1
