a shocking video claims to show the cruel method used to catch tuna that unnecessarily kills hundreds and thousands of sharks , dolphins , turtles and other species every year			1
@entity9 consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they eat is caught using this method , unless the tuna brand elects to state it on their label			1
and @entity19 has warned that the popular ' dolphin friendly ' tag used by many tuna brands is ' meaningless ' because it is not regulated			1
@entity44 animals including whale sharks , silky sharks , marlins , rays , oceanic whitetip sharks , olive ridley sea turtles , mako sharks and other mixed species of fish - some of which are threatened species - are seen caught up in the nets and cast aside by fisherman			1
at the end of the video the dead marine animals are dumped back into the ocean			0
@entity19 oceans campaigner @entity61 said the purse seine nets pictured in the video – which are nets that circle around schools of fish before being drawn up like a purse – were not necessarily harmful when used on their own but were problematic when used with @entity34			1
' the fish aggregating devices are designed to attract tuna but they also attract all sorts of other marine life , ' mr @entity61 told @entity71			2
' when you use those two methods in combination you end up catching large amounts of incidental species you do n't mean to catch			0
' a tuna fisherman on a boat in the @entity42 is pictured with a dead mariln @entity9 fishing companies have not been linked to the video but @entity9 consumers may eat fish caught using this method without knowing because it does not need to be stated on the label of tuna cans in the video released by @entity19 , fisheries from @entity36 , the @entity37 and @entity38 are shown using fish aggregating devices ( @entity34 ) and purse seine nets to catch tuna in the @entity42 @entity9 consumers have no way of knowing where their canned tuna comes from because food labelling laws in @entity9 only require that canned tuna companies state where the fish is packed ( usually @entity96 ) and not where it is caught			1
@entity19 says 90 percent of tuna caught in the @entity42 is caught using @entity34			1
most tuna caught in the western @entity99 is caught using the less harmful ' pole and line ' method or using purse seine nets without @entity34			1
around 800,000 tonnes of tuna are caught in the @entity42 , where the video was taken , each year			2
around 2.6 million tonnes are caught in the western @entity99			0
' most tuna in the @entity99 is caught using purse seine nets , which is a fairly clean way of fishing because giant schools of tuna tend to swim on their own , ' mr @entity61 said			0
' they do n't tend to catch as many sharks , turtles or other species as you would using this device			1
' mr @entity61 said every major @entity9 canned tuna brand has committed to removing fish aggregation devices from their supply chains by the end of next year , but the organisation is still calling for clearer labelling laws			2
' we 've been asking for all seafood in @entity9 to be labelled where it 's caught , not where it 's put in a tin , ' mr @entity61 said			2
' so @entity9 consumers can make an informed choice about whether they want to buy tuna that results in killing hundreds of thousands of sharks , dolphins , whales and turtles			1
' mr @entity61 added that ' dolphin friendly ' labels on tuna cans were ' relatively meaningless '			1
' it 's not regulated ; some people put their own dolphin friendly label on their tins without any official body giving them that logo , ' he said			2
' and just because it 's so - called dolphin friendly it does n't mean it 's not killing sharks or other species as well			1
' marine animals affected include whale sharks , silky sharks , marlins , rays , oceanic whitetip sharks , olive ridley sea turtles , mako sharks and other mixed species of fish - some of which are threatened species @entity9 consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they are eating is caught using the @entity34 method a spokeswoman for @entity167 said dolphin - free labelling is n't covered by the @entity169 , but consumer law comes into play regarding misleading or deceptive claims			1
mr @entity61 said there were also issues for conscious consumers when they eat fresh tuna from supermarkets or restaurants			0
' in supermarkets customers need to be told where it was imported from , but it could be caught anywhere in the world and brought to @entity183 or @entity96 to be packed , ' he said			0
' in a restaurant they do n't have to tell you anything whatsoever , you could be looking at your sashimi or red tuna steak with no way of knowing where it 's come from			0
' @entity194 , host of new documentary series what 's @entity196 which starts screening this thursday on @entity197 , said consumers should look for the label ' pole and line caught '			0
' as a consumer in this country foreign labelling laws make it virtually impossible for you know what you 're eating , ' mr @entity194 told @entity71			0
' if i 'm looking for tinned tuna i 'd be looking for pole and line caught , because even if you do n't know where it 's come from you know how it 's caught			0
' mr @entity194 added that tuna fisheries in @entity9 were well managed			2
@entity216 , ceo of the @entity9 @entity217 , said @entity9 tuna fishers only supply fresh tuna , and have not produced tuna for use in cans since the 1990s			2
mr @entity216 said 96 percent of tuna in @entity9 was caught by the ' ranching ' method , in which tuna is caught live using purse seine nets and towed to farms to grow larger for six months			1
he said the other 4 percent was caught using the ' pole and line ' method , which sees fish caught using lines with about 1200 baited hooks attached			0
pictured is a transponder and fad in the @entity42 purse seine nets circle around schools of fish before being drawn up like a purse mr @entity216 added that @entity9 tuna fishers do not use @entity34 and the practice is banned in local waters			1
' we do n't need to use @entity34 , we catch a high quality premium tuna which swims in schools naturally in clean areas , ' he told @entity71			2
' we use planes to see the movement of fish and we use bait to attract it			0
' mr @entity216 said it was easy for tuna brands to say they were dolphin friendly because dolphins did not tend to swim near most species of tuna			1
' the schools they catch in the @entity99 and @entity42 do n't move with dolphins , ' he said			0
' in the eastern @entity99 dolphins move with yellow fin tuna			0
' they actually have methods of lowering the side of the purse seine nets and it 's possible with divers to move the dolphins out but it takes time			0
' @entity19 said the nets were not necessarily harmful but were problematic when used with fads in this still from the video , a number of dead fish can be seen being dumped back into the ocean			0

a shocking video claims to show the cruel method used to catch tuna
' @entity34 method ' unnecessarily kills hundreds and thousands of sharks , dolphins , turtles and other species every year
the method uses a device to attract tuna but it also draws other animals
@entity9 have no way of knowing if their tuna is caught by this method
@entity19 has warned the popular ' dolphin friendly ' tag is meaningless
