the parents of a gay son whose death they feel partially responsible for have now dedicated their lives to helping the parents of other gay children			1
@entity6 and @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , learned their son @entity10 was gay when he came out to them at just 12 - years - old , but the devout @entity12 lived by the @entity13 , and as a result did everything they could to tech their son that he could fight his urges			1
in the end he could not , and @entity10 died of a drug overdose when he was just 20 - years - old			1
gone to soon : @entity21 ( above ) died of a drug overdose when he was 20 guilt : his parents , @entity25 and @entity26 ( above ) , feel partially responsible as they thought @entity10 should fight his homosexuality after coming out to them at just 12 - year - old fighting the urge : @entity10 would meet weekly with his pastor and attend reparative therapy in a bid to stop being gay now , the @entity35 travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children			1
while they make it clear they never stopped loving their son , they do regret not accepting him for who he was			0
they encouraged him to fight his feelings while attending reparative therapy and meetings with his pastor weekly as a teenager			1
' basically , we told our son that he had to choose between @entity52 and his sexuality , ' said @entity25			2
and while this worked for some time , in the end @entity10 could not deny his sexuality			2
this led to him running off and using drugs when he was just a teenager they say , and going over a year without speaking to either of his parents			0
' suddenly our fear of @entity10 someday having a boyfriend ( a possibility that honestly terrified me ) seemed trivial in contrast to our fear of @entity10 â€™s death , especially in light of his recent rejection of @entity70 , and his mounting anger at @entity72 , ' wrote @entity25 on her @entity74 page			0
when @entity10 came back though after 18 long months , the family did accept him , and his boyfriends , but sadly their time together was short lived			2
just 10 months after returning @entity10 overdosed after a night out with his old friends			1
he died after 17 days in the hospital			0
memories : now @entity25 and @entity6 travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children @entity85 words : ' i grieve , not only for my oldest son , who i will miss every day for the rest of my life , but for the mistakes i made , ' wrote @entity25 on her @entity74 ' now , when i think back on the fear that governed all my reactions during those first six years after @entity10 told us he was gay , i cringe as i realize how foolish i was			1
i was afraid of all the wrong things , ' wrote @entity25			0
' and i grieve , not only for my oldest son , who i will miss every day for the rest of my life , but for the mistakes i made			0
i grieve for what could have been , had we been walking by faith instead of by @entity99			0
' @entity6 and @entity25 are now leaders of an @entity104 , contributors to the website @entity102 , have started an lgbtq group at their church , and speak out on behalf of the lgbtq community around the country .			0

@entity6 and @entity7 have devoted their lives to helping @entity12 parents accept their gay children after losing their gay son to an overdose
@entity21 came out to his parents when he was just 12 - years - old , but the devout @entity12 told him to fight his urges
@entity10 would meet with his pastor weekly and attend reparative therapy , but at 18 it became too much and he ran away
@entity10 was gone for 18 months and became *addicted* to drugs
10 months after he returned , and his parents *mended* their *relationship* with him , he died
