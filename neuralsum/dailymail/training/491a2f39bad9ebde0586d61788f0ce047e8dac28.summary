white lines could be scrubbed out from the centre of urban roads after research showed the move dramatically cut the number of speeding cars			1
@entity7 , which controls major roads in the capital , conducted a study on three routes which showed vehicle speeds fell by up to 13 per cent			1
the report concluded : ‘ centre lines and hatching can provide a psychological sense of confidence to drivers that no vehicles will encroach on ‘ their ’ side of the road			2
white lines could be scrubbed out from the centre of urban roads after research showed the move dramatically cut the number of speeding cars ( stock picture ) ‘ centre line removal introduces an element of uncertainty which is reflected in lower speeds			1
’ @entity7 says the practice could be expanded to more routes - subject to ‘ careful analysis of the site to determine if it is appropriate ’			2
roads where markings are used to highlight particular hazards , such as approaches to complex junctions , would not be considered			0
removal of white lines has been backed by road safety campaigners			1
@entity45 , executive director of crash reduction charity @entity46 , said : ‘ @entity46 welcomes the news that white line removal has led to significant speed decreases on 30 mph roads			0
‘ at a time when government is promoting cycling and walking but cutting enforcement budgets , self enforcing measures are key			0
‘ @entity7 is to be credited with trialling this measure			0
we look forward to its wider use , including with 20mph roads			0
’ removal of white lines has been backed by road safety campaigners , who argue it slows drivers down @entity7 studied roads which had just been resurfaced			1
the most dramatic results were recorded on @entity69 , in @entity70 , which has a 30mph limit			0
the speed of southbound traffic fell by 4.1mph from an average of 32.4mph to 28.3mph - almost 13 per cent - while northbound traffic speeds fell from 31.4mph to 29mph			2
the @entity70 study follows previous research from the government ’s @entity79 which concluded there are ‘ safety benefits ’ to be gained from removing white lines in 30mph zones			1
earlier trials by @entity86 and @entity87 found that not reinstating white lines after resurfacing led to reductions in collisions causing injury , and in overall vehicle speeds			1
a @entity95 spokesman said : ‘ decisions on what type of traffic calming to provide are for local authorities , taking into account local circumstances and road layout			0
it is for them to decide if removing centre lines is appropriate			0
’ he added that researchers from the @entity79 had concluded that removing white lines ‘ did help slow traffic but worked best when combined with other measures ’ .			2
