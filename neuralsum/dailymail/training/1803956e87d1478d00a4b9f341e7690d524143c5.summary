ash dieback has spread the length and breadth of @entity4 , official data shows			1
the devastating disease affecting ash trees , first detected in @entity7 in @entity8 in 2012 , is now found from @entity9 to @entity10			1
it has also spread into a handful of sites in @entity14 and @entity15 , information published by the @entity17 shows			1
the number of @entity20 woods affected by the disease has tripled in little over two years , with nearly 1,000 sites showing signs of the fungus that causes it			2
@entity25 , first detected in @entity7 in @entity8 in 2012 , is now found from @entity9 to @entity10 in december 2012 the microscopic fungus chalara fraxinea was found in 291 sites			1
on january 6 this year officials found the disease in 949 sites			2
most experts now accept there is little chance of killing the disease , with all activity focused on simply slowing its spread			0
but the new report suggests that the government 's efforts so far have made little impact			1
more than £ 16.5million has been spent tackling ash dieback and other tree diseases , including trying to find a strain of ash resistant to the chalara fungus			1
that search has so far been fruitless and scientists believe the ash problem will eventually spread into every woodland in the country			0
the problem is the biggest threat to @entity20 woodlands since @entity54 elm disease killed off 25million mature trees in the 1970s and 1980s			2
it could have a huge impact on other species			0
a total of 955 species rely on ash trees , including wood mice , squirrels , bullfinches , wrens , bats and beetles			1
of these , 45 species rely solely on ash , including the large ash bark beetle , centre - barred sallow moth and scarce yellow pinter crane fly which are all likely to become extinct in @entity7			2
@entity73 , environment secretary , said : ' we are doing all we can on ash dieback			1
it is a serious issue ' environment secretary @entity73 accepts there is no quick answer to the problem			0
' we are doing all we can on ash dieback			1
it is a serious issue , ' she told @entity82			0
' we 're looking at various ways of dealing with it but we do n't have a magic bullet			0
we do n't have a solution and we 're still carrying out research on that			0
' the disease , which causes rapid leaf loss , works particularly quickly on young plants , killing them within a year			0
older trees can withstand the initial infection but tend to die after several seasons of attacks			0
the disease was first recorded in @entity97 in 1992 , but was unheard of in @entity7 until late 2012			1
it is believed to have been introduced by spores blown across the @entity100 or by imported saplings			0
restrictions on the movement of ash plants were introduced two years ago but the disease has continued to spread .			2
