by @entity0 and @entity1 over ten million @entity3 owners downloaded @entity5 's maps app in 48 hours , the search giant has revealed			1
the app is expected to replace @entity9 's own mapping software on the majority of @entity11 - although @entity9 does not let users delete its app. ' more than 10 million downloads in less than 48 hours after release ! ' said @entity5 's @entity16 , announcing the milestone online			1
' we 're excited for the positive reception of @entity22 for @entity3 around the world			0
' the @entity3 's default maps app was previously powered by @entity5 until @entity9 took over with its own software in early september and blocked users from using @entity5 's app. but the gadget maker was bombarded with complaints for its app 's errors and forced into a humiliating apology to customers that led to the sacking of the man in charge of its development			1
however , the firm does not let users delete the @entity9 maps software			2
lost : in one particularly bad error , @entity53 police warned @entity55 could kill after it directed users looking for a city to this barren stretch of outback the app was even blasted by @entity53 police as ' potentially life threatening ' after it sent users off course in the outback			0
today @entity5 thanked its team for the work to create its own app. ' congratulations to the @entity67 on the recognition for the passion and hard work they poured into it , for this release and over the last 7 + years , ' said @entity16			2
the @entity22 app includes public transport directions and traffic information , for which they are famous , as well as rotating @entity78 and @entity79 views and street view			0
@entity81 , director of @entity22 for @entity82 , wrote on the company 's official blog : ' the app shows more map on screen and turns mobile mapping into one intuitive experience			2
' it is designed from the ground up to combine the comprehensiveness and accuracy of @entity22 with an interface that makes finding what you 're looking for faster and easier			0
' last weej police in @entity53 warned drivers with @entity11 not to navigate with @entity55 after users looking for one city found themselves in barren outback more than 40 miles away			0
motorists following the much - criticised mapping service to the city of @entity105 in the country 's south - east ended up in the middle of the nearby @entity109			0
with no nearby water supplies and temperatures in the park reaching as high as @entity114 , police warned the mapping error had the potential to be ' life - threatening '			0
@entity9 launched the maps service in september after dumping @entity5 's maps in the latest version of its @entity3 and @entity121 software			1
instead , it decided to create its own , using partners such as @entity123 for data , while also using helicopters and planes to create @entity79 maps of major cities			0
however , when the app was released , users discovered thousands of flaws			0
this led to outrage among users who flooded @entity135 and @entity136 with examples of @entity9 's flawed maps			1
@entity9 ’s shares may plunge another 20 per cent as the company slides towards a ‘ @entity142 ’ , analysts have claimed			2
investors in the tech giant - the most valuable company in the world - have been ‘ panic selling ’ and brought the price down from its high of $ 705 a share in september to its current price of $ 547			0
now there are fears that it could slump to $ 420 or lower amid fears @entity9 has run out of ideas			2
analysts said that the company must avoid what is known as a ‘ @entity142 ’ where both long and short term prospects look grim			0
that will happen when a stock ’s 50 day moving average goes below its 200 day moving average - a very real possibility with @entity9			0
the @entity167 - based company has been rocked in recent weeks by reports revealing the strength of the competition from @entity5 and @entity171			0
errors noticed by users and tech reviewers included major towns such as @entity183 appearing to be missing , searches for @entity173 bringing up @entity174 - a football club for the over-fives , and large parts of the world obscured by cloud in satellite views			0
the product 's shoddiness prompted @entity9 ceo @entity188 to replace @entity189 , the executive in charge of @entity9 's mobile operating system , and @entity193 , the executive who had overseen the mapping team			1
he was even forced into issuing and humiliating apology and recommending that @entity3 owners consider using google maps through a mobile web browser or seek other alternatives until his company could fix the problems			1
@entity5 engineers started working on their new maps app before @entity9 's september 19 decision to evict them from @entity206 , @entity5 's mr @entity81 said , though he declined to be more specific			1
the additional tools in @entity5 's free @entity3 mapping app include turn - by - turn directions			1
these have long been included on @entity212 versions of the software and @entity5 's previous refusal to include it on the @entity3 is believed to be one of the reasons @entity9 decided to develop its own technology			1
the friction that has developed between @entity5 and @entity9 as they jostle for leadership in the increasingly important smartphone market also played a role in the mapping switch			2
@entity5 's new @entity3 mapping app also will offer its street - level photography of local neighbourhoods for the first time on @entity9 's mobile operating system , as well as three - dimensional views , public transit directions and listings for more than 80million businesses			1
the @entity3 app still lacks some of the mapping features available on @entity212 - powered phones , such as directions in malls and other buildings			2
a difficult road ahead : @entity9 's maps were slammed for their poor location information and distorted images , forcing the company into issuing an apology and fire two executives deemed responsible for the mess up there still is n't a @entity5 mapping app for @entity9 's top - selling tablet computer , the @entity121 , but the company plans to make one eventually			1
in the meantime , @entity121 users can access see the maps in an @entity3 mode			0
@entity5 's free mapping solution is likely to become one of the hottest commodities in @entity9 's app store , if for no other reason because of pent - up demand among @entity3 owners fed up with @entity9 's alternative			1
some @entity3 owners even refused to upgrade to @entity9 's newest software , @entity206 6 , because they did n't want to lose access to the old @entity5 mapping application built into @entity268 and earlier versions .			1

@entity9 dumped @entity5 from its latest software in september
@entity9 's ceo forced into humiliating apology to customers over errors
@entity5 's new app has more features to bring it in line with @entity212 version
