by @entity0 it is one of the biggest processions in the @entity5 calendar - but for one member of yesterday 's parade ahead of the @entity9 it was all too much			1
as the @entity12 made her way from @entity14 to the @entity15 just after 11am , six - year - old cavalry horse @entity10 had other plans			1
the gelding , who joined the army 's fleet two years ago , bolted - hurling his rider into the path of @entity12 's bespoke new carriage just metres away			1
bolted ! @entity10 , a six - year - old gelding , threw his rider off and fled his station outside @entity27 when the procession started for the @entity9 - just seconds before the @entity12 approached in her carriage			1
the rider was n't injured and stood up and saluted the queen as she passed but incredibly , the unnamed trooper leaped to attention with his sword to salute the queen as she passed			1
meanwhile , his black charger cantered wildly towards @entity37 , trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public			0
eventually , he came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable			2
a spokesman for the @entity44 said : ' @entity10 just got spooked			1
it does ask quite a lot of them , these parades , particularly the young ones			0
' @entity10 has n't done many yet , he 's only been with the army for two years			1
this parade had only been rehearsed once			2
you can see the ( more experienced ) ones which know what songs are coming next			0
their ears prick forwards when they hear a song they like			0
' but with the younger ones it is common for them to bound off			0
this week is big for them - they are doing 10 parades in as many days			0
it is a big ask			0
' hold your horses ! @entity10 , who is still new to parades , galloped towards @entity37 trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public			2
he eventually came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable unlike the drum horses , the blacks and greys are all named with a common letter for each year			2
an 'm - reg ' , @entity10 was named after a battle fought in @entity83 in december 2007			1
recruited in 2012 , he underwent training to ignore the noise of @entity87 traffic and carry the weight of full ceremonial gear			0
the @entity90 looks for animals that are no less than 16 hands high and unbroken , with a good weight , good attitude and no blemishes			0
they are then broken , ridden , and gradually trained with more and more ceremonial ' furniture ' to build up their strength			0
it is only when they appear to have accepted the sound of the @entity104 bands - and demonstrated this in a major parade - that a horse can ' pass out ' to join the @entity104 proper			2
procession : the @entity12 travelled to the @entity15 in the new @entity111 coach heavy duty : the parade was one of 10 in 10 days for the horses , who must calmly complete at least one major procession , not reacting to traffic or music , before they can ' pass out ' into the regiment proper			1

six - year - old *gliding* @entity10 bolted outside @entity27 during the parade ahead of the @entity9
threw the unnamed trooper out of the saddle into the path of @entity12 's carriage as she headed to @entity129
but incredibly the soldier stood and saluted the *monarch* while @entity10 was stopped by four soldiers
