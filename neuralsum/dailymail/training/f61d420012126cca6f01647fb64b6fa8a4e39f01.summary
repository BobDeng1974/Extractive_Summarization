@entity1 banks have issued directives to ease up the workload and overbearing schedules of summer interns for fear that they are losing the best and the brightest to jobs in @entity8			1
many former interns said that their average workdays lasted for 13 to 14 hours , and it was not unusual to stay in the office until the early hours of the morning at least one or two days per week			0
in the @entity15 office of @entity16 their schedules were so demanding that many began taking naps in the toilets in order to sustain themselves			1
extreme : a number of interns at @entity26 office reported that they resorted to taking naps in the toilet stalls , putting in their earphones and setting alarms for a short while later ( stock photo ) daunting : @entity16 had no comment about the specific allegations of ' toilet naps ' in their @entity15 office ( pictured ) the so - called ' toilet naps ' were reported to @entity38 with multiple former interns telling the paper how they would go into the toilet stalls , plug their headphones into their cell phones and set an alarm to wake them up a short while later			2
@entity16 would n't comment on those specific allegations , which stem from members of the 2011 summer intern class , but did say that they - like many top banks - are looking for ways to improve their employees ' quality of life while on the job			1
' we are constantly evaluating our analyst program to ensure that it is a challenging and rewarding yet balanced experience , ' a spokeswoman told @entity38			0
the self - reflection process started in earnest this fall after the summer death of 21 - year - old @entity63 - @entity62 intern @entity61 died from an epileptic fit following three - straight ' all nighters '			1
in turn , that bank launched a review of their practices and has since decided that summer interns should be granted at least four weekend days per month			2
@entity71 is trying out a pilot program that grants younger bankers one ' protected weekend ' per month where they will not be called into the office - let alone expected to respond to incessent calls and emails during that time			0
@entity78 started the search this fall and the first suggestion that came out of a task force to address the issue was the decision to lessen the amount of weekend work across the board that they demanded of interns			0
exhausted : @entity61 was a week from completing a coveted placement at @entity91 â€™s @entity90 offices when he was found dead in the shower at his temporary accomodation changes : @entity91 - @entity62 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) have both announced that they are going to significantly lessen incoming interns weekend workloads @entity98 has formed a similar committee to look into the issue of how they can improve the ' quality of life ' factor for their junior staffers			1
the @entity38 reports that @entity98 has not announced any blanket statements about weekends off , as the bank 's chief executive @entity107 is against the idea			0
mr @entity107 reportedly said that by implementing such requirements could stop younger bankers from having the chance to work on high - profile assignments			0

interns at @entity16 ' took naps in the toilets because they were so *overworked* ' during their summer program
comes as banks are *overhauling* their programs to make the schedules *slightly* less intense so that the top *candidates* do n't all go to @entity8
last summer a @entity63 - @entity62 intern died of a *seizure* after pulling three - straight all nighters
