by @entity0 from @entity2 to delicate rose bushes , it seems there 's little that artist may @entity5 ca n't turn into a sculpture			1
but these are not your average sculpture			0
instead of stone or bronze , @entity5 creates her incredibly intricate pieces using lipstick			1
unfortunately for those who fancy owning a lipstick sculpture of their own , would - be buyers will need deep pockets , as each piece costs an eye - watering £ 529			1
clever : @entity25 artist may @entity5 turns ordinary lipsticks into mini sculptures and sells them for £ 529 nevertheless , the @entity25 artist says that her pieces can be used for their original purpose , although they might not look the same afterwards			1
' they can be used since all the lipsticks are new , ' @entity5 explained in an exclusive interview with @entity34			1
' i like to use @entity36 and @entity37 because their texture is harder and they always have special colours , ' she continues			0
' @entity41 is also great , as they have a beautiful red colour series			0
' the lipsticks , which have now gone on sale at luxury launches website , @entity46 , are available in a choice of themes and can also be customised with portraits of the customer 's choice			2
@entity5 , who began her career as a make - up artist , takes between 12 and 13 hours to create a floral sculpture but says the more detailed portraits can take up to a week			1
elaborate : lipsticks used in @entity5 's botanical series are set in flower - filled wooden containers ' as a senior make up artist , i understand cosmetics very well , ' adds @entity5			1
' but understanding cosmetics does n't mean being limited			2
' i reinterpreted the meaning of lipstick			2
each sculpture makes lipstick become an art work			2
each lipstick is a brand - new story			0
' for those wondering what sort of person wants lipstick - turned - art in their lives , @entity5 has some answers			1
' most of the people who order the lipsticks do so as a special gift to special person , ' she reveals			0
no limit : according to @entity5 , clients can choose to have their own or another portrait sculpted onto their lipstick ' i have quite a lot of male clients who order it for their wives , which is so sweet			1
of course some of my clients order them for themselves , as they want their own face on the lipstick			0
' while for now @entity5 says she 's concentrating on lipstick art , she says she wo n't rule out working with different types of cosmetic in future			1
' i have done it before , ' she explains earnestly			0
' i once used stick foundation to create my art and i 'd like to try powder foundation and eye shadow			2
' she pauses for a second and adds : ' blusher too ! ' @entity105 ( l ) and @entity106 ( r ) star again , alongside @entity108 ( second from left ) may says keep the lipstick around 17 - 25 ¿			0
do not put it into the refrigerator as it will crack may 's art is sculpted in about 10 - 12 hours			0
for more complicated ones , it could take a week or longer			0

@entity25 artist may @entity5 uses lipstick to create clever mini sculptures
the works , which cost £ 529 each , come in a choice of portrait or flowers
lipstick art is now available in the @entity127 for first time , as well as @entity129
according to @entity5 , the sculptures can still be used as originally intended
unfortunately , putting the lipsticks to use means they wo n't last as long
