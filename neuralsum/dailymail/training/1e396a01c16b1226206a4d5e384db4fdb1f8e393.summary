the 6th @entity8 in @entity9 yesterday reversed the child abuse determination made by the @entity12 @entity11 against @entity13 , who whacked her daughter so hard with the cooking utensil she caused bruising			1
' we can not say that the use of a wooden spoon to administer a spanking necessarily exceeds the bounds of reasonable parental discipline , ' justice @entity17 wrote for the unanimous three - judge panel			1
spanking : the 6th @entity8 in @entity9 , pictured , yesterday ruled that spanking a child with a wooden spoon is not abuse , setting an surprising legal precedent social workers wanted to report the @entity31 mother to the state @entity34 's child abuse database with a ' substantiated ' abuse determination			1
that determination was upheld by a trial court judge			0
however , while the appeals court said the spanking came close to abuse , it ruled that social workers and the lower court judge failed to consider the family 's entire circumstances			0
@entity13 and her husband testified that other forms of punishment such as groundings and taking away her phone had failed to persuade their 12 - year - old daughter to do her schoolwork			1
they said she as increasingly ' boy crazy ' and had developed a growing interest in gangs			0
the parents said other family members had testified that spankings in the household were a rarity but the implement was used in the april 2010 incident after the girl failed to come home until late at night			0
weapon : @entity13 whacked her daughter so hard with a wooden spoon , like that pictured , she caused bruising ( stock photo ) the appeals court said the mother 's growing frustration with her daughter 's behavior and her intention not to inflict harm in the spanking weighed heavily in its ruling			1
' nothing in the record suggests the mother should have known she was inflicting bruises , ' @entity17 wrote			0
@entity17 continued that ' the spanking was entirely the product of a genuine and deliberate disciplinary purpose , i.e. , to arrest troubling behavior patterns exhibited by the daughter			0
' the court ordered the child abuse report to be withdrawn or @entity13 given another hearing in which the @entity9 family 's entire circumstances are considered and the spanking put into context with the parents ' growing frustration with a recalcitrant daughter .			2
