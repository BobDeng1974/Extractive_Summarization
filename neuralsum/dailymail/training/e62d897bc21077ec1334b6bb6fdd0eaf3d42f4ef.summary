scientists have developed a promising treatment for prostate cancer by starving tumours of their blood supply			1
@entity6 researchers say the new approach could be tested in patients within two years , potentially giving them the ability to stop cancers growing and spreading			1
the scientists made the breakthrough after discovered a molecule which plays a key role in aggressive prostate cancer			1
crucially , the academics from @entity18 and @entity19 universities have already worked out how to neutralise the dangerous molecule			0
the new approach could be tested in patients within two years , potentially giving them the ability to stop cancers growing and spreading			1
the prostate is pictured in orange , containing a small tumour the treatment , delivered by an injection , has already been shown to halt the growth of prostate tumours in mice			1
and scientists are confident the procedure can be replicated in humans , with a @entity6 firm investigating how to turn it into a clinical treatment			0
the findings , published yesterday in the @entity38 medical journal , rests on the investigation of a molecule called @entity41			2
the scientists found that the molecule enables the tumour to form new blood vessels			1
tumours need a supply of nutrient - enriched blood to survive , grow and spread			2
stopping the production of new blood vessels prevents cancer cells from multiplying , they found			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , accounting for a quarter of all male cancers			1
twenty per cent of patients die within five years of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis , with few treatments available to doctors			1
shrinking tumours by cutting off blood supply is an approach that has already been shown to work in colorectal cancer - but until now scientists had struggled to find a way to do the same thing in prostate tumour			1
the study leaders are now investigating whether the same molecular target will work in other tumours - with potential that the drug could be used to treat a range of diseases			0
the @entity74 is still failing to deliver the best diagnosis and treatment to thousands of men with prostate cancer , says the first national audit of services			1
it shows a ‘ worryingly vast variation ’ in access to advanced @entity85 scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques			0
half of all men with the disease do not receive all the support services they should in hospitals , the @entity87 found			0
four out of five radiation centres in @entity94 do not offer brachytherapy – which uses radioactive seeds planted inside the prostate and can help half of men retain their sex lives			0
the service is not provided at a single centre in @entity104 - run @entity103			0
prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men			2
in the @entity6 , more than 41,000 are diagnosed each year leading to around 10,000 deaths annually			0
survival rates in the @entity6 are below the @entity111 average and research into the disease lags a decade behind that for other cancers , say critics			0
the scientists made the discovery by analysing samples of human prostate cancer , observing that @entity41 increases as the cancer got more aggressive			1
in experiments on mice , they found that injecting an inhibitor drug called @entity125 three times a week , stopped the molecule from working and the tumour growth halted			2
study author dr @entity129 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ we reasoned that inhibition of @entity41 activity could stop cancer progression			2
‘ indeed , we show in this paper that if we decrease @entity41 levels in prostate cancer cells , or in tumours grafted into mice , we are able to inhibit tumour vasculature and growth			1
’ he said : ‘ this is a completely new area and could form a completely new class of drugs			0
tumours all need blood to survive and grow , to differing degrees depending on the type			0
‘ if this is show to work in clinical trials it could be used to inhibit all kinds of cancers			0
’ biotech company @entity153 , a spin - out drug development firm from the @entity155 , is looking at developing @entity41 inhibitors as treatments for other diseases with abnormal vessel development			0
they think sight problems where blood vessel development is key - such as age - related macular de-generation - could also benefit from the same approach			2
study co-author professor @entity164 , from @entity19 , said : ‘ our results point to a novel way of treating prostate cancer patients and may have wider implications to be used in several types of cancers			1
’ dr @entity172 , deputy director of research at @entity174 , which helped fund the study , said : ‘ there ’s no denying that there are too few treatment options for the 40,000 men that face a diagnosis of prostate cancer every year in the @entity6 – especially for those with advanced disease			1
‘ prostate cancer continues to kill over 10,000 men annually and there is an urgent need for new treatments if we are to significantly reduce this figure			2
the treatment , delivered by an injection , has already been shown to halt the growth of prostate tumours in mice ‘ although it ’s early days , each finding like this represents a crucial block in building up our understanding of what can slow down and stop the progression of prostate cancer			1
this understanding will give us the foundations needed to develop new targeted treatments for those men in desperate need			0
’ the lack of treatments for men with prostate cancer is exacerbated by the fact the @entity74 is not using all those available to them , a report on cancer services revealed yesterday			2
the @entity87 showed a ‘ worryingly vast variation ’ in access to advanced @entity85 scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques			0
half of all men with the disease do not receive all the support services they should in @entity74 hospitals , and four out of five radiation centres in @entity94 do not offer brachytherapy – which uses radioactive seeds planted inside the prostate and can help half of men retain their sex lives after treatment			0
survival rates in the @entity6 are below the @entity111 average and research into the disease lags a decade behind that for other cancers , say critics .			0
