by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 20 september 2013 the legendary deep - fried @entity2 bar has become the symbol of everything that is wrong with the artery - clogging @entity6 diet			1
but now an unlikely @entity8 skirmish has broken out after a @entity10 firm applied to patent the fat and sugar - laden ‘ delicacy ’			2
@entity13 , based in @entity14 , claims its technique produces a tastier and healthier deep - fried @entity2 bar than the @entity6 version			1
calorific copy : @entity13 at @entity10 's @entity14 are attempting to patent their version of the classic @entity6 battered and deep - fried @entity2 bar it involves chilling the chocolate bars before frying them in batter made from buttermilk imported from the @entity26			1
now the firm ’s owner , @entity27 , has lodged an application with the patent office in @entity10 which , if approved , would stop anyone else copying his technique			2
but the @entity6 chip shop that claims to have given the world the deep - fried @entity2 bar has accused mr @entity27 of ‘ piggy backing ’ on its calorie - laden creation			1
@entity2 - vellous : @entity27 wants to patent his deep - fried @entity2 bar technique mr @entity27 , 33 , charges @entity39 £ 3 for his deep - fried bar – the @entity41 – compared with the £ 1.50 typically charged @entity6			1
he said : ‘ it took us about six months to develop the perfect way of frying chocolate bars			0
' we ’ve taken the deep - fried @entity2 bar and changed it into something more of an indulgent dessert			1
‘ it ’s all about storing them at the correct temperature and using a different kind of batter – which means that you ’re left with a lovely , fluffy , gooey mouthful instead of an oil - filled crispy bar that many chip shops serve			2
’ the @entity58 – formerly known as the @entity59 – is now considering application b1218841.3 from mr @entity27 , which concerns a ‘ cooking method ’			0
he said : ‘ i want to protect our scientific way of making the treat instead of the actual bar itself			2
we ’re proud of our technique			0
’ the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 , is first credited with dipping @entity2 bars in batter and plunging them in to the fat fryer			0
last year it ended up in a row with @entity2 , which complained it had not ‘ authorised ’ the use of its product			0
owner @entity78 said : ‘ we have been serving deep - fried @entity2 bars for more than 20 years now			1
mr @entity27 obviously heard about our issue with @entity2 last year and is trying to piggyback on it			0
you 're bar - ed : a patent would mean that @entity13 's @entity2 bar , which are chilled before they are dipped in a special batter made from @entity26 buttermillk , would be protected she added : ‘ no matter what happens , the deep - fried @entity2 bar was born here in @entity6			1
it is , and always will be , @entity6			0
‘ the way we do it works and it will continue to be popular with everyone who visits for years to come			0
’ however , top @entity6 pastry chef @entity97 said the @entity98 could keep it as far as he was concerned			0
mr @entity97 , who runs a restaurant in @entity101 and represented @entity6 on @entity103 series @entity104 , said : ‘ if this guy from @entity10 wants to claim the deep - fried @entity2 bar , then he is more than welcome to it			1
‘ the sooner @entity6 gets rid of this image of the deep - fried @entity2 bar as the national dish , the better			1
‘ we have so many other better @entity6 delicacies to celebrate			0
the whole idea of deep - fried chocolate is just strange			2

@entity10 *confectioner* wants to patent the deep - fried @entity2 bar
@entity13 in @entity14 has a ' healthy ' way of making the treat
*capital* firm charges £ 3 for treat , double what you pay in @entity6
