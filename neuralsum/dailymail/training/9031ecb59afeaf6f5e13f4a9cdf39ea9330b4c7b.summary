he said : ' i have not been made aware of it but it seems to be double standards			1
' if you are not allowed to take children out of school and the headteacher disappears for a month , it seems to be double standards to me			1

the short explanation stated : ' i 'm sure you will agree with the governors and staff that sharing our good learning and teaching practice with other schools and students is vitally important			0
' we support learning in many different ways and after half term the school governors have given @entity31 an unpaid secondment to work on the @entity147 phonic project			0
' this is an exciting opportunity to share our school 's phonic learning skills			0
' mr @entity151 will be acting head for the three weeks she is away			0
' a spokesman for @entity154 defended the decision saying : ' the headteacher is not on leave and this is not a personal project			0
' she is on an unpaid professional secondment that will benefit the children 's learning			2
' @entity2 teachers have previously visited @entity164 to help the children learn about other cultures			2
