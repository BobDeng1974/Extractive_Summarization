by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 18:13 est , 22 october 2012 the former boss of @entity2 has been condemned for urging the public to boycott elections for police and crime commissioners			2
justice secretary @entity7 attacked lord @entity8 for telling people not to vote for elected commissioners because he does n’t believe they should be managing forces			1
the cross-bench peer , who was branded ‘ @entity17 ’s favourite policeman ’ during his time as @entity15 , said the best way to stop the shake - up was to stay away on november 15 , when elections will be held across @entity21 and @entity22 except in @entity23			1
boycott : lord @entity8 ( right ) has told voters to ignore the elections for police and crime commissioners but justice secretary @entity7 said the remarks were ' silly ' and former senior officers should not make them but mr @entity7 hit back , saying : ‘ i think it ’s a very silly thing to say			1
i ’m very sorry he ’s said that			0
nobody should ever look upon a democratic election as something they should n’t take part in			0
‘ @entity38 has decided to put these positions in place , i think they ’ll make a real difference locally and they will give frustrated communities unhappy about their policing somewhere to turn to get help			1
we should not have a former senior police officer making a silly comment like this			2
’ the commissioners – who will be paid between £ 65,000 and £ 100,000 – will replace police authorities , taking charge of budgets and overall strategy for the 41 forces			2
they will also have the power to hire and fire chief constables , which critics warn could politicise policing			2
lord @entity8 , who was forced out of his job in 2008 when @entity61 took over as @entity23 mayor , said : ‘ i actually hope people do n’t vote because that ’s the only way to stop this			1
this is not an appropriate system			0
’ questions on police commissioners he said the police areas , which are larger than constituencies and local authorities , would be too big for any individual to manage properly			0
@entity74 yesterday said the commissioners would ‘ put people in charge of policing ’ and ‘ bang heads together to get things done ’			1
he added : ‘ if you want more tough policing , you can get it			0
if you want coppers who are on the beat , on your street , cracking down on anti-social behaviour , focusing on the things you care about , then do n’t just talk about it , get out on november 15 and vote for it			0
’ ministers have been accused of failing to explain the shake - up to the public , or attracting enough high - profile candidates			1
the @entity95 says turnout could be as low as 18.5 per cent			0
former deputy prime minister @entity97 and @entity17 mps @entity98 and @entity99 are the best - known candidates .			0

@entity8 , who was forced out of the @entity102 when @entity103 mayor @entity61 took *control* in 2008 , said the ‘ @entity107 model ’ will not work in @entity105
the *crossbench* peer warned that chief officers may be put off from *mounting* political *investigations* , such as the cash - for - *honours* affair , because they risk losing their jobs
@entity7 said former senior officers should not make such ' silly ' comments public
