@entity0 ( pictured at court yesterday ) has settled his multi-million pound legal dispute with his former agent over the right to back out of the contract he claimed he was misled into signing the world 's number one golfer , pictured yesterday at court , was suing @entity11 's @entity10 over the cut the firm was taking from on - and off - course earnings @entity0 was not in court for the brief hearing and the terms of the settlement were not detailed in court			1
but a source close to the case said the settlement was ' far north ' of $ 20 million , the equivalent of £ 13.1 million , which @entity0 is believed to have paid to @entity10			1
' it 's in the public domain that the amount of money owing under the contract and the money likely to be generated from the the contract was $ 20 million , ' a source said			2
' the settlement was in excess of that , plus costs			0
' it is understood the figure was $ 25 million , or £ 16.4 million , which includes substantial legal costs			0
@entity0 , fresh from a weekend victory in @entity60 , had sued mr @entity62 's agency over the cut his firm was taking from on and off - course earnings in a potentially ugly row over £ 4.2 million in fees			1
mr @entity62 , who was flanked by supporters in the public gallery , hugged and kissed them after the announcement was made			0
a brief statement agreed between the @entity0 and @entity11 camps was released following the hearing			2
agent @entity62 ( pictured outside the hearing ) was in court today , and was seen hugging and kissing his supporters as it was announced that the settlement had been reached ' the legal dispute between @entity0 and @entity10 has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties , who wish each other well for the future , ' it said			1
' the parties will be making no further comment			0
' the two sides had been locked in talks for about 10 hours yesterday at the @entity91 complex in central @entity16 , with @entity0 leaving last night at about 9pm without making any comment			0
when the case was called this morning , @entity93 , senior counsel for @entity0 , told the court : ' the entire matter has been resolved			2
' judge @entity97 said the dispute was undoubtedly a long and difficult issue for both sides to deal with			0
@entity0 was in court yesterday , just days after he won the @entity102 on sunday sunday 's win at the @entity102 is a repeat of @entity0 's first as a professional back in 2009 he also wished mr @entity62 success as a sports agent in the future and @entity0 success on the golf course			2
@entity0 is believed to have offered @entity62 almost £ 8m to settle prior to tuesday 's adjournment at the @entity15			1
that offer was turned down by @entity11 , who was confident his company had a watertight contract with @entity0 that entitled them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of his endorsement money until 2017			1
@entity0 's deal with @entity119 , which he signed while with @entity10 , is reportedly worth around £ 150 million , which gave @entity10 plenty of reasons to fight for a larger settlement			1
@entity0 had terminated his contract with @entity10 in 2013 to form his own company , and was suing the form and leading agent mr @entity62 , claiming he was misled into signing the contract			1
in court papers when the case was launched later that year , it was claimed that @entity0 signed up with mr @entity62 's agency at an informal meeting on the day of @entity10 's @entity134 in 2011			1
mr @entity62 had counter-sued the golfer after the lawsuit was launched in late 2013 for walking away from his contract - claiming that he owed the company millions of dollars in lost commissions			2
the case had been scheduled for eight weeks in the big business division of the @entity142 - reserved for cases where disputes are worth more than 1 million euro ( £ 755,000 ) - before the prospect of long and potentially personal arguments being teased out in full public view led to renewed attempts at a settlement			2
@entity0 and mr @entity62 together at a @entity150 at the @entity151 in @entity152 in 2012 two days of talks between both camps last december yielded nothing			0
the dispute centred on @entity0 's contract with @entity16 - based @entity10 and two other linked companies - @entity160 - based @entity159 , and @entity161 , also based in the @entity163 capital			1
at the heart of it was rates the golfer was being charged - pre-tax 5 per cent of prize winnings and 20 per cent of sponsorship and appearances money			0
@entity0 , pictured outside the @entity16 @entity172 yesterday , had terminated his contract with @entity10 in 2013 and formed his own company when the lawsuit was launched in late 2013 , @entity0 's lawyer had contended that the fees were up to four times what one of the best golfers in the world would expect to pay to agents			1
the golf star , who took up the game as a youngster in @entity186 , @entity187 , and now has a home in @entity189 , claims the terms were inferior to those given to other top 10 players including fellow countryman and major winning friend @entity194 , who was in the same stable			0
@entity0 's business interests are now overseen by @entity196 , which is headed by @entity198 , formerly of @entity10 , his father @entity199 and family friend and business executive @entity199 , who also oversees much of the golfer 's charitable work under the @entity204			1
along with the golfer 's personal assistant @entity207 and family member @entity209 , the golfer 's team spent about 10 hours in the @entity91 yesterday thrashing out the terms of the deal			0
his father @entity199 arrived at the courts yesterday at 5pm			0
none were in court today			0
among the disputes raised when the case was launched was a row over an alleged 166,000 euro ( £ 125,350 ) donation to @entity220 on the eve of a trip to @entity223 when @entity0 was an ambassador for the charity			2
there was another fallout over @entity10 using complimentary airline seats on a flight to @entity229 booked by tournament organisers in @entity0 's name			1
the young golfer 's career soared in the year after he signed for mr @entity62 from @entity234 's stable earning more than £ 10 million in 2012 , before a slump took hold in 2013 and earnings fell back to around £ 1.5 million			2
last season @entity0 appeared more driven , earning more than £ 7 million , and he is now favourite to complete the career grand slam of golf at the @entity241 in april			2
@entity0 broke off his engagement to tennis plater @entity243 in may last year @entity0 was with @entity10 when he won the @entity245 , rose to number one in the world and signed the five - year sponsorship deal with @entity119			1
a dip in form followed and his engagement to tennis star @entity243 ended , but the @entity252 has four majors to his name			0
if recent form on the course offers any insight into his demeanour with a massive and costly contract row hanging over him , @entity0 appeared focused when picking up his latest trophy			0
sunday 's win at the @entity102 is a repeat of his first as a professional back in 2009			0
@entity0 is due back in competition @entity264 at @entity266 in @entity189 at the end of the month where the winner will walk away with £ 724,00 .			0

number one golfer was suing @entity11 's @entity10

both parties now say they are satisfied after case was settled out of court
