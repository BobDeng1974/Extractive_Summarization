by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 08:57 est , 28 may 2013 a captive penguin was left out in the cold after he managed to escape from its enclosure , then decided he wanted to get back inside again			1
the flightless bird apparently built up enough speed in the pool at @entity9 , @entity10 , to leap from the waters and over a barrier to bring himself face to face with tourists			1
but finding himself among the guests gawking at the new @entity17 : @entity19 attraction seemed to much for the penguin , who first tried to flee then vainly tried to jump back into the pool			1
i 'm out ! now what ? a penguin wonders what to do next after leaping from his enclosure into the midst of visitors at a new exhibit at @entity9 in @entity10 uh oh , here comes the screws : @entity35 security moves in quickly to keep the escapee apart from visitors i 'm outta here : the flightless marine bird tries to make a getaway while the security man 's back is turned coming back : he apparently thinks better of trying to escape and returns to where he leapt from the pool scared : as two security men form a human barrier , the penguin desperately tries to leap back in to captivity rescue : finally a handler appears , grabs the penguin and flings him back into the pool with his friends the incident was caught on camera by a visitor			1
the video shows the penguin staring forlornly back into the tank he has just leapt from at his pals who are still inside			2
@entity35 security rushed to surround the bird and keep him apart from tourists , but the bird has other ideas and tries to quickly waddle off to find another route back into captivity			2
guards have to rush to shepherd him back			0
' i hope he 's not hurt , ' a woman visitor is heard saying in the background			0
' he fell pretty hard			0
' eventually a wildlife expert arrives on the scene , picks up the bird , and drops him back into the pool .			0
