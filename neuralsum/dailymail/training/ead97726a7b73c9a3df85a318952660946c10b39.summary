housework is just one of those things that needs doing			2
so when one of your pets seems intent on interrupting , the pain of spending time on chores feels all the greater			0
in this amusing video , an inquisitive hound appears put out by an addition to his lair - the trusty vacuum			2
@entity17 eyes up the vacuum cleaner as it tries its hardest to protect her surroundings jumping up and snaring its jaws around the hose , @entity17 spends the next minute and a half defending its space , pawing and slapping at the ' enemy '			1
the dog follows the vacuum around the kitchen area , not prepared to give its owner a minute 's grief from the tidying			1
the sound of the electrical device confuses the protective pooch , not realising that it 's all in aid of improving its home			0
the @entity36 believes dogs are scared of vacuums for a number of reasons			2
lack of exposure , fearful disposition , a feeling that it is a ' monster on wheels ' and a herding instinct are all reason why a dog may engage with the appliance			1
' for starters , vacuums make odd noises , ' states the @entity36			0
' add to that the fact that you are thrusting it around using erratic movements and that it 's long trunk is sucking all sorts of things from the floor			0
no animal in the wild does anything like that			0
' the protective pooch is unsure of the vacuum 's motives and tries to clasp its jaws around the hose			1

@entity17 is overly - *suspicious* as owner tries to clean the kitchen
dog snaps its jaws around the hose and leaps up slapping away
fear of the ' monster on wheels ' leads dogs to *mistrust* the appliance
