@entity0 has given the clearest hint yet that he is ready to quit @entity2 and move to the @entity3 with @entity4			1
the @entity2 star , regarded as one of the finest midfielders in world football , is locked in a contract dispute with the @entity11 champions			2
on monday @entity0 took the unusual step of taking @entity2 ’s media responsibilities ahead of the @entity20 clash with @entity19			1
the @entity32 midfielder said : ‘ it ’s no secret , the @entity3 is a possibility for me			2
‘ i ’ve heard that people have written that i might go to @entity36			0
but there ’s nothing new from my point of view			0
mind games : @entity0 ( left ) could just be looking for a new deal at @entity2 boost : @entity4 boss @entity27 will hope @entity0 is keen on a move to @entity44 ‘ no decision has been made			1
the situation is that i do n’t have any agreement at the moment at @entity2			2
on the other side there is no agreement in place anywhere			0
’ @entity0 was outstanding in the centre for @entity2 during the 2 - 0 victory at the @entity55 in the first leg in @entity57			1
he has been flirting with the idea of a move to the @entity3 after failing to reach an agreement over a new contract with the runaway @entity13 leaders			2
although @entity2 coach @entity63 is confident that he can convince @entity64 to remain in @entity65 , @entity4 are about to begin a massive overhaul of their squad			1
stay with me : @entity63 ( pictured ) hope to have @entity0 at @entity2 for ' many seasons ' @entity0 would instantly become one of the top earners in @entity36 football — on around £ 250,000 a week — if he decided to move to @entity73			1
@entity63 , who oversaw @entity2 ’s staggering 6 - 1 victory at @entity75 on saturday afternoon , appeared determined to keep one of the finest talents in @entity32 football			1
the @entity2 manager said : ‘ @entity0 is a great talent , a good , good player			1
he can be better and better			0
i said to him , “ you have time to become an even better player ”			0
‘ i hope he maintains his form this season and for more seasons at this club			0
’ @entity27 was in the stands at the @entity55 to watch the @entity0 masterclass			0
@entity0 scored the opening goal for last season ’s @entity20 winners and had more touches on the night than @entity19 ’s entire midfield put together			0
he has been with the @entity32 giants since he was 16 , but now wants pay parity with some of the top earners at the @entity26			0
@entity98 and @entity99 command the top salaries at the club and @entity0 is demanding a huge increase			0
international : @entity0 will be a key part of the @entity105 squad for the @entity106 in @entity107 warning : @entity108 has said @entity0 should not ' overplay his hand ' in contract talks with @entity2			1

@entity4 target @entity0 hints at @entity3 move
@entity2 midfielder *reveals* no decision has been made about his *future*
manager @entity63 wants to make @entity0 a better player and ' have him for many seasons '
@entity108 *insists* @entity2 will not be held to *ransom* to keep @entity0
