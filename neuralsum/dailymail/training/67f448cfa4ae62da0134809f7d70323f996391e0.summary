by @entity0 a schoolboy was rescued from deadly quicksands @entity2 this week by firefighters who were luckily training nearby			1
@entity5 , 13 , was fishing around @entity2 in @entity6 with his father and a friend when he strayed into a particularly treacherous area and started to sink			1
the boy called out to his father for help , by which time he was waist - deep in the mud			1
stuck in the mud : @entity5 , 13 , got stuck while looking for a place to fish in @entity2 , @entity15 trained : the firefighters had been practising quicksands rescues nearby when they received the call			1
they used a sand lance - a special kind of pump - to loosen the treacherous mud so that they set @entity5 free @entity23 , 44 , knew he risked getting trapped himself if he followed he son , so faced an anxious wait when he called the fire service to come to @entity5 's aid			1
by coincidence , the rescuers were able to arrive in minutes - because they have been practising quicksand rescues just moments before			1
the firemen were able to reach @entity5 by using inflatable walkways to cross the treacherous sands			1
from there they were able to use sand lances - a special pump designed to soften quicksand - to shift the boy free from the mud and pull him to safety			2
after the hour - long procedure , @entity5 was given medical checks , but was unharmed and was at school the following day			1
mr @entity5 said : ' he ’d gone to a channel where there might be fish , crossed to the other side and sunk			2
reaching out : after an hour - long rescue operations , the firemen were able to pluck @entity5 from the sands from safety : the firefighters used inflatable walkways to approach @entity5 without getting trapped themselves ' he shouted for me so i walked round the corner , where there ’s a bit of a cliff , and i could see he was knee - deep in quicksand			1
' i knew i could n’t get to him without getting stuck myself so i kept my cool and phoned the coastguard			0
' fire station manager @entity61 said : ' we ’d been practising on a colleague who was up to his chest in quicksand and had just released him when we got the call			0
' @entity68 sets like concrete so we turned on the water to liquify it , which allowed us to lift one leg out at a time			0
' we were in a very fortunate position - the tide was well out so we had time on our side			0
it could have been a very different story			0
' @entity5 was pulled free in less than an hour and handed over to a waiting ambulance			0
he was taken to hospital for precautionary checks but was back at school the following day			0
@entity2 is notorious for its shifting sands and unpredictable tides , which can catch out unwary walkers on its huge mud flats			2
rescued : @entity5 was eventually set free , completely unharmed by his ordeal			0
though rescuers warned it could have been worse were the tide not so far out at the time the return : @entity5 was checked over in an ambulance , but was unharmed and able to go school the next day the most deadly incident at the bay came in 2004 when 21 workers fishing for cockles drowned after being trapped by incoming tides			1
the men and women - illegal @entity100 immigrants working for gangmasters for very little pay - could not be rescued after they were overcome by a combination of the cold february weather and incoming seas , which their leaders had failed to predict properly			0
a @entity108 spokesman said : ' the sands of @entity2 shift over the years and the shore has changed dramatically			2
' thirty years ago much of the shoreline was grass or marsh but about ten years ago the river came right in to the shore , scouring away the areas where it was safe to walk			0
' now there are many areas of soft quicksand close to the shore			0
' @entity122 station officer @entity121 said : ' of all the scenarios we train to prevent and resolve , quicksand rescue is undoubtedly the most difficult and onerous			2
' a child stuck up to the waist , especially with an incoming tide , is our worst nightmare , as the possible consequences do not bear thinking about			0
' however , it is a very real possibility as the sands out in the @entity2 are truly lethal			0
' we urge everyone to take the warnings seriously and not to hesitate to dial 999 and ask for @entity122 if you think someone may be in trouble			0
' the @entity2 disaster took the lives of 21 @entity100 immigrant workers , who were labouring on the sands at night for pitifully low pay			1
they were part of a gang of almost 40 workers , who were picking cockles from the mud flats out to sea when they were surprised and cut off by the incoming tide			1
the workers - none of whom had permission to work in the @entity154 - tried to swim back to shore but most were overwhelmed by exhaustion and the february cold before they made it back			2
@entity159 : the drowned workers were picking cockles on the mud flats of @entity2 ( file photo ) in total 14 workers are thought to have escaped , while the rest were later found dead on the sands			1
an inquest into the workers ' deaths heard that the cockles were being bought from the workers - hired by illegal gangmasters - at a rate of just £ 5 for a 25kg bag , or 9p per lb.			2

@entity5 , 13 , out with his father and a friend at the bay in @entity6
strayed too far from the shore *hunting* for fish , and sank waist - deep in sand
luckily , firefighters called to help had just been practising quicksand rescue
they used inflatable walkways and ' sand lance ' pumps to loosen the sands
@entity5 was then pulled unharmed from the bay , and could go back to school
@entity2 is notorious for deaths after 2004 disaster which killed 21
gang workers illegally picking cockles were trapped by the tide and died
