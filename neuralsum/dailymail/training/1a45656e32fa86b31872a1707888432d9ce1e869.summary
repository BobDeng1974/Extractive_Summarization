when tragedy struck her family , photographer @entity7 chose to pick up the camera instead and unknowingly began forming a collection of photos that documented what life looked like after a murder			1
@entity7 's sister @entity15 was stabbed to death by her husband in the family kitchen , leaving their two young sons without a mother and with a father behind bars			1
' i was obviously in a state of grief and shock when it happened and i just stopped doing everything in my life , ' ms @entity7 told @entity31 about the 2007 murder			2
facing the uncertain : for the year after their father killed their mother , @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) were kept in the dark about exactly what happened for fear that their father would take them away from the custody of their maternal grandparents changes : when @entity15 was killed in 2007 , her mother ( pictured right ) took custody of her two grandchildren and moved them from their home in @entity52 to her house in @entity54 , @entity55 heartbreaking : the boys initially were told that there father was staying behind in @entity52 to help police find who killed their mother			1
they did n't know that he was the one who stabbed her to death watchful eye : it was only after their father 's sentencing , when he accepted a 25 - year plea deal , that they learned what happened and their grandparents were awarded custody a professional fine arts photographer , ms @entity7 could not even bring herself to pick up a camera until three months after @entity15 's death			1
by that time , @entity15 's two sons - @entity36 , 2 , and @entity79 , 4 - had been taken out of temporary foster care and been temporarily placed in the guardianship of their maternal grandparents			1
in her memory : @entity7 , the boys ' aunt , told @entity31 that they love hearing stories about their ' beautiful ' mother @entity15 ( pictured ) it was only when the family gathered for @entity89 at her mother 's @entity54 home that she thought to bring her camera , as her mother wanted a photo of the seven grandkids together for her @entity96 card			1
' it was really the first time i had had a camera in my hands , ' ms @entity7 told @entity31			0
' i was so sad and instead of looking at them directly , i just started taking pictures of them , ' she said of the two orphaned boys			2
at first glance , the pictures appear to be just simple depictions of the normal lives of everyday children			2
it is only with the knowledge of what the boys went through that a new element of sadness is cast over each image			2
ms @entity7 took photos of the boys starting from three months after the murder and stretching until just recently			1
' the last time i saw them , it did n't feel right to shoot them so i have nâ€™t actually shot them in two years because i do value our privacy and our relationship too much , ' ms @entity7 said			0
their father , @entity133 ' @entity131 , accepted a plea deal of 25 years for second degree murder			2
powering through the pain : ms @entity7 , a professional fine arts photographer , found the first @entity89 after her sister 's murder the most difficult and she found it comforting to look at her nephews through a camera lens stopping the bad guys : the boys sometimes receive cards from their father behind bars moving on : @entity36 , the younger of the two , reminds ms @entity7 of his slain mother with his mischievous sense of humor growing up : the boys are both extremely athletic and have adapted quickly to their new home in @entity54 keeping busy : @entity36 and @entity37 , seen here with other relatives , now live with their aunt who also has a son their age and ms @entity7 says that all three boys are being raised like brothers in court , he said that he stabbed his wife in the midst of an argument , but gave little other explanation as the case never went to trial			1
he legally had custody of the couple 's two sons for months immediately after the murder and his wife 's mother and father , the boys ' grandparents , was given temporary custody while he was behind bars up until he was finally sentenced			1
' we fought a really long battle to keep them and my parents were visited all the time by social services , ' ms @entity7 said of the period before her grandparents were granted full custody			0
during that waiting period , the relatives kept mum on what happened between the boys ' parents because they feared that , since @entity131 still had legal authority over the boys , he may revoke their guardianship of them			0
' it feels like it was yesterday and then it feels like it was ten years ago , ' ms @entity7 says of her sister 's murder moving fast : ms @entity7 said that as time went on , she began taking fewer and fewer photos of her nephews during their visits rights of passage : @entity37 , seen here ahead of his @entity210 , enjoys sports just like his younger brother but ms @entity7 says that he can be slightly more quiet at times ' they knew that their mother was dead and they thought their father was helping them find the person who killed her , ' ms @entity7 said of what they told @entity36 and @entity79 , who now prefers to go by @entity37			1
' they were confused ! we felt like such a * * * * * * s ! ' ms @entity7 said of the pressure of keeping the truth of their mother 's death under wraps for so long due to the custody controversy			0
now , the boys lives have adapted to life far removed from the 2007 murder in their old house in @entity52			1
they originally were taken in by their grandparents in @entity54 , @entity55			0
their aunt @entity236 and her son - who is about the same age as @entity36 - moved into the grandparents home for a time and now @entity236 has moved out and takes care of all three of the boys , raising them like brothers			1
small moments : the boys have adapted to their new life but their aunt caught several of their reflective moments on camera ( @entity36 seen here with one of his aunts ) ' they 're both extremely athletic and they are really the kind and smart and really great kids , ' ms @entity7 said of @entity36 and @entity37 who are now 9 and 11 years old respectively			1
' @entity37 is more quiet and really smart			0
he 's like a superstar basketball player			0
@entity36 's hilariously funny and reminds me a lot of my sister			0
he 's kind of mischievous			0
' when i look at him and he says something i immediately think of my sister			0
he 's so freaking cute			0
' the boys are aware of the photo project that their aunt has put together through the years , but they are not overly interested in looking through those trying times			2
' they love talking about their @entity266 because they love hearing stories about her but they 're 9 and 11 - they want to talk about the @entity268 and the @entity269			0
they 're doing their sports stuff , ' ms @entity7 told @entity31 .			0
