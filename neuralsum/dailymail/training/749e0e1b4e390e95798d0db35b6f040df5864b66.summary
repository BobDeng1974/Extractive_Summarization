by @entity0 most mornings , @entity2 ’s ten - year - old son would awake groggy and bleary - eyed and announce to his mum : ‘ i need a coffee			1
’ it was an astonishing start to the day for such a young boy , but what is more incredible still is that @entity10 ’s caffeine dependency had developed at a @entity12 outlet in a local school			1
@entity10 , now 12 , was at the time a pupil at an independent primary school in @entity16 , @entity17 , and would visit friends on his way home at the nearby private @entity21 , which is one of 70 schools with its own @entity12 concession or vending machines			1
students at @entity28 building in @entity17 queue up for their caffeine fix			2
more than 70 schools across the country now have such outlets ‘ the @entity33 is in the school ’s sports centre , which is open after school while there are clubs and activities going on , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ he and his friends saw the bigger children drinking coffee and it became the “ cool ” thing to do			2
strictly speaking , the coffee bar is for sixth - formers and people using the sports centre , but i do n’t think anyone checks , especially after school			1
‘ so he started drinking lattes and cappuccinos			0
at first i thought it was all right as an occasional treat but after a while i realised that it was getting out of control			0
he was acting like a stressed - out adult			1
i put a stop to it right away			2
’ @entity2 , 35 , is angry at what she sees as the cynical exploitation of children by @entity12 , which last year made more than £ 807 million and is opening coffee shops in the @entity67 at the rate of three a week			1
‘ @entity10 would never have got into drinking coffee at such a young age if the @entity12 concession had n’t been in a school , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ @entity21 should be a safe place , not one where big businesses can promote unhealthy products to children			0
’ so how has this sudden surge in coffee bar concessions in schools come about ? while parents who can afford private education have the choice to opt for schools without ready access to caffeine - laden @entity86 , those with children in state schools do not			1
pupils at @entity21 , @entity16 , pictured , can buy @entity12 in the sports centre - which is open after school hours for clubs and activities there are a number of state schools with @entity12 outlets including @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 ; @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 ; @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 ; @entity109 in @entity110 ; @entity28 in @entity17 ; @entity111 in @entity112 ; @entity113 in @entity114 ; and @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117			1
in most cases they are introduced by catering companies , such as @entity121 and @entity122 , which provide school meals			0
these firms pay to become @entity12 franchisees and , in turn , make money from selling coffee in schools			1
it is unclear whether the schools themselves profit			0
it ’s a particularly attractive proposition , not least because the products sold are 20 per cent cheaper than on the @entity135 , owing to their vat exemption as they ’re being served to children			0
unsurprisingly , perhaps , @entity12 says it has ‘ seen an increase in the number of [ school ] catering teams approaching us directly			1
’ ‘ in all instances the college , school or their caterer will come to us , ’ a spokesman said			2
according to new figures from parent company @entity150 , @entity151 , the branch which includes its coffee business , has seen sales rise by 18.5 per cent to £ 79.5 million in the first quarter of this year			0
state school @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 is another institution with a @entity12 machine			1
in most cases , they are introduced by catering companies , such as @entity121 and @entity122 , which provide school meals @entity160 , from the @entity161 , says that , aside from raising the company ’s profile among coffee drinkers of the future , the benefit to @entity12 is the money it makes from selling its franchise to catering companies that supply the schools			1
the caterers are also obliged to buy raw materials from @entity12			1
‘ any profits made from the outlet would usually go straight to the catering company as franchisee , ’ says mr @entity160			0
so what ’s in it for the schools ? a @entity121 spokeswoman says coffee outlets in schools are an ‘ emerging trend ’ because ‘ schools encourage their sixth - form students to remain in school when they have breaks			1
‘ @entity121 has a wholesale agreement with @entity12 which enables the company to serve @entity12 products			2
we are provided with everything from the machines , beans , milk and cups			0
’ she did n’t know what profit they would make from @entity12 bars in schools but ‘ it ’s not something we would comment on ’			1
she also said she did n’t know how or if the profits were split between the school , the catering company and @entity12			1
dr @entity207 is senior deputy head of @entity208 ’s , a smart private school in @entity210			0
he says the outlet at his school has proved popular with adults visiting the theatre that is also housed on site , as well as with sixth - formers and younger pupils who may visit after school			2
he insists , however , that the outlet does n’t raise any additional money for the school			0
figures from parent company @entity150 suggest @entity151 , the branch which includes its coffee business , has seen sales rise by 18.5 ¿ ¿ per cent to £ 79.5 ¿ million in the first quarter of this year ‘ a parent asked me on open day whether it was ethical to have a company like @entity12 in our school , ’ says dr @entity207			1
‘ i think that if you are going to drink coffee , then you might as well drink a decent brand			0
‘ @entity235 was set up when we built a new theatre which is used by students as well as the general public			0
it ’s a good facility			0
‘ we do monitor the pupils carefully , however , to make sure that they do n’t buy more than two per day			0
the younger pupils tend to buy hot chocolate and cookies			0
we are also looking at a policy whereby the older pupils can only buy caffeinated drinks in the morning			2
after first break they would have to have decaf			0
’ one of the secrets of @entity12 ’s success must certainly be excellent forward planning			1
already an unmissable presence in garages , service stations and hospitals , the company appears to have turned its attention to the youngest and most impressionable members of society			0
@entity261 , owner of the branding experts , which works with some of @entity67 ’s top independent schools , says he would advise clients considering an outlet to ‘ proceed with caution ’			2
experts say the company 's move in to schools is to ensure brand loyalty at an early age ( library image ) ‘ why is @entity12 keen to get in schools ? effectively it is a marketing exercise to build brand loyalty , ’ says mr @entity261			1
‘ if children drink @entity12 at school , they are more likely to choose @entity12 over the competition			1
’ @entity281 , a lecturer in the @entity282 at the @entity283 , who has researched marketing to children , agrees			0
‘ what @entity12 is trying to do here is secure loyal customers at a ridiculously early age , ’ says ms @entity281			2
‘ there has been a lot of research into bank accounts and mobile phones which shows it is effective			0
‘ children make a connection between consumption and popularity : you have to wear the right clothes , own the right phone and why not drink the right sort of coffee ? ‘ this sort of branded marketing is insidious because children do n’t have the critical faculties to make informed choices			0
’ aside from what critics would regard as blatant exploitation , there is also the implication for health			0
astonishingly , it is possible to notch up in excess of 3,000 calories — more than a full day ’s allowance for a grown man — in one @entity12 drink : a large mocha latte with extra cream , syrup and a chocolate flake			2
in a country with a growing child obesity problem , this is surely a serious concern			2
dr @entity330 , who specialises in public health and obesity , believes there are ‘ alarming ramifications ’ to @entity12 ’s presence in our schools			1
‘ we want children to develop good nutritional habits , so what are we teaching them if we ’re selling them sugary coffee ? ’ she says			2
‘ we know that coffee can have addictive properties , as does sugar , so this can be a doubly potent drink			0
‘ if i were a coffee marketer , i would think it genius to get children buying my products so early in their lives			0
’ fortunately , @entity2 stepped in before her son became too dependent on coffee , given that caffeine withdrawal can cause symptoms including violent headaches , nausea and the shakes			1
but other children in state schools up and down the country who are developing expensive habits , courtesy of the taxpayer , may not be so fortunate			2
additional reporting : @entity365 .			0

' he was acting like a stressed - out adult . i put a stop to it , ’ she said
