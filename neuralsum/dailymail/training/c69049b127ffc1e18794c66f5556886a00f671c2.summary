by @entity0 dentists are calling for a dramatic reduction of around 75 per cent in daily sugar consumption to save the nation ’s teeth			2
experts at @entity7 say consumption of added sugar in treats like sweets , cakes , chocolate and fizzy drinks should be cut to around four teaspoons a day			1
a cap at that level would equate to less than half a normal can of @entity18 , which contains nine teaspoons of sugar , two digestives or just one bowl of @entity23 cereal			1
if the sugar intake is cut to the level dentists want , that would be less than half a normal can of @entity18 or just two digestives the availability of advanced toothpastes and the addition of fluoride to the water supply in some countries and regions has reduced tooth decay , however treatment still accounts for 6 - 10 per cent of total health costs			1
a study published today argues that only a significant cut in the use and consumption of sugar – particularly when it is added to processed food and drink – will make a difference			2
the findings will fuel demands for the introduction of some kind of sugar tax on fizzy drinks and other foods – similar to those applied to cigarettes – in order to drive up the cost and drive down consumption			1
any such measure would be fiercely fought by the food industry , which insists sugar is natural source of calories and can be eaten safely as part of a normal healthy diet			2
the warnings about sugar consumption come from professor @entity66 , who is @entity67 at @entity7 and co-author of the study			0
prof @entity66 said : ‘ tooth decay is one of the most widespread health problems and it is thought around a third of @entity75 children aged 12 have visible tooth decay			1
‘ added sugar has found its way into almost all food , and the use of sugar as a means to calm , entertain , or reward children has become normalised , whereas sugar should be an occasional treat			0
‘ the government must stop acting in the best interests of the food and drink industry rather than individuals , and take action on sugar now			0
’ the government ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity91 , has expressed sympathy for the idea of a sugar tax , while an expert group set up by the official watchdog @entity97 has signalled it should be considered			0
an ‘ options for action ’ document prepared by the organisations identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake : a tax on sugary drinks ; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar ; a cut in portion sizes ; advertising rules being tightened ; health warnings on sugary products ; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet			1
the report estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks , which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p , would cut the number of overweight @entity75 by more than a quarter of a million			1
the average sugar consumption per day is around 58g or 14.5 teaspoons for adults and 76g or around 19 teaspoons for teenagers			0
the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) has recently called for a reduction in consumption to around 5 per cent of daily calories , which equates to 25g or six teaspoons			0
the new study suggests even lower levels are necessary to protect teeth from decay or caries , bringing the figure down to 2 - 3 per cent of calories , which equates to 15g a day or four teaspoons			1
that would represent a reduction of 74 per cent against the current average for adults			0
the research paper , co-authored by @entity143 and obesity expert professor @entity144 , of the @entity146 , is published in the @entity147 concludes : ‘ previous analyses based on children have misled public health analyses on sugars …			0
the much greater adult burden of dental caries highlights the need for very low sugar intakes throughout life , e.g. 2 - 3 per cent energy intake , whether or not fluoride intake is optimum			2
’ nutritionist and @entity160 , @entity161 , backed the study findings , saying : ‘ added sugars are completely unnecessary in our diets and are strongly linked to dental decay as well as to obesity and @entity168			0

@entity170 is equivalent to less than half a normal can of @entity18 , two digestives or one bowl of @entity23
tooth decay treatment still accounts for 6 - 10 per cent of total health costs
experts estimate a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks would cut the number of overweight @entity75 by more than a quarter of a million .
