by @entity0 a journey through @entity2 ’ impressive landscape has been made possible through a series of incredible images that reveal its surface in unprecedented detail			1
the images allow you to plummet into the breathtaking depths of its darkest canyons , float over its black dunes and revel in the beauty of the red planet ’s spiralling whirlwinds			2
they were taken by @entity21 ’s observation satellite @entity19 ( @entity19 ) and provide a previously unseen vision of @entity2 , whose landscape has been taking shape for more than three billion years			1
since 2006 , the @entity19 has been charting the red planet 's terrain			1
this image shows defrosting of the crests of ' @entity31 '			0
this is the informal name given to a set of intersecting ridges that are located among the layered materials of the south polar region of @entity2			2
their origin has never been understood since its arrival in orbit in 2006 , @entity19 and its @entity39 ( @entity39 ) telescope have been mapping the martian surface			1
the @entity39 team released preliminary , black - and - white images in march of that year , and have since collected hundreds more			2
now @entity46 has compiled a selection of these in his book ‘ this is @entity2 ’ which is designed to be a visual atlas of the red planet			1
black - sand dunes on the floor of @entity2 ' crater have been formed from cooled lava rock			1
this is one of the first sand dune fields ever recognised on @entity2			2
in winter , these dunes are covered by frost and @entity60 ice the circular depressions , swirls and cliffs shown here are created by frozen co2 on @entity2 evaporating into gas			2
the sun 's sharp angle provides the energy that drives this process as @entity71 , manager of @entity72 at @entity73 points out : ‘ along with @entity74 , @entity2 is the planet whose history is the most rich and diverse			1
’ in order to best capture the geological and mineralogical contours of this mythical planet , the team decided to maintain a consistent point of view , with each photograph covering a 6 - km wide strip			1
highlights include defrosting of the crests of ‘ @entity31 ’ - the informal name given by @entity91 scientists in 1972 to a set of intersecting , rectilinear ridges on the south polar region of @entity2			1
their origin on @entity2 has never been understood , but seems to be linked to volcanic dykes			2
an impact crater reveals the layers of the @entity101 on the red planet			0
these layers are composed of clay minerals formed by the transformation of liquid water , providing evidence of @entity2 's ancient , humid past cuts into @entity2 ' south pole sedimentary layer reveal that the area was made up of water ice , rather than frozen @entity60			1
the cuts were made due to dramatic changes in temperature which can vary by as much as 100 ° c a further image reveals black - sand dunes on the floor of @entity2 ’ crater which have been formed from cooled lava rock			1
the image shows one of the first sand dune fields ever recognised on @entity2			1
in winter , these dunes are covered by frost and @entity60 ice and deprived of sunlight			0
another group of sand dunes is shown to be lit by the sun shining down directly from above			0
last year , researchers found that sand dunes on @entity2 , once thought to be unchanging , are actually dynamic and active today			2
these canyons show the regions of @entity134 and @entity135 , lying at approximately 26.8 degrees north latitude and 135.7 degrees east longitude			0
the northwest - aligned valles are @entity139 of the @entity140 , an area thought to be covered by a layer of lava			0
today , this once - smooth volcanic plain is incised by channels fast dunes can travel a distance equal to their length over 170 years			0
the book takes you on a journey into the deep cuts of @entity2 ’ south pole sedimentary layer revealing that they are made up of water ice , rather than frozen @entity60			1
the cuts were made due to dramatic changes in temperature which can vary by as much as 100 ° @entity159 @entity2 has vast glaciers hidden under aprons of rocky debris near mid and lower latitudes			0
in this image , the lines in the lower left largely parallel revealed the direction the glaciers flowed			0
the fissures have similarities to those formed by @entity172 glaciers this image shows region of the @entity174 formed in @entity175 and at the end of summer			0
the dark patches shown fractures in the carbonic ice mr @entity46 provides a captivating picture of how circular depressions , swirls and cliffs are created by frozen co2 on @entity2 evaporating into gas			0
he hopes these images will ‘ fuel our imagination , opening up multiple interpretations and thus inciting us to think about our world and ourselves			0
’ scientists have long known that the red dust on @entity2 can swirl and blow around in dust storms and small whirlwinds , dust devils			1
these whirlwinds can cover huge areas of the planet , spiralling random trajectories a group of sand dunes is lit by the @entity200 shining down directly from above			0
last year , researchers found that sand dunes on @entity2 , once thought to be unchanging , are actually dynamic and active today			0
fast dunes can travel a distance equal to their length over 170 years			0

images compiled by @entity210 - based @entity209 in his book ‘ this is @entity2 ’
they were taken by @entity21 ’s @entity19 in 2006
each image maintains consistent point of view covering a *6km* wide area
