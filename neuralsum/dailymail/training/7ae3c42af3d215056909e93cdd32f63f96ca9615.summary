by @entity0 the @entity3 flight that crashed in @entity4 in july killing three people was going dangerously slowly , a new document reveals			2
@entity3 said in a report to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) that the flight crew failed to maintain a minimum air speed during its final approach			0
the @entity12 airline also blamed what it called ' inadequate warning systems ' for alerting the crew that the auto - throttle had stopped maintaining the set air speed			1
the @entity3 flight that crashed at @entity19 , was probably caused by the pilots flying dangerously slowly @entity3 has blamed the design of the auto - throttle for the crash , an issue that had been raised previously it suggested the aircraft manufacturer , @entity25 , modify the low speed alert system on its planes			1
immediately after the july 6 , 2013 crash at @entity19 , @entity3 said there appeared to be no mechanical problem with the aircraft			0
but in its latest document the airline blamed the design of the auto - throttle , an issue that had been raised previously			1
however , in its submission to the @entity7 , @entity25 said ' there were numerous cues ' that the aircraft 's speed was slowing dangerously and it placed the blame for the crash squarely on the pilots			1
three people were killed in the crash , with one of the victims , a 16 - year - old girl , apparently surviving being ejected onto the tarmac , only to be run over by a fire truck the aircraft manufacturer said : ' this accident occurred due to the flight crew 's failure to monitor and control air speed , thrust level and glide path on short final approach			1

' the crash killed three people and injured more than 180 and was the first fatal commercial plane crash in the @entity64 since february 2009			0
one of the victims , a 16 - year - old girl , apparently survived being ejected onto the tarmac , only to be run over by a fire truck			0
but aircraft manufacturer @entity25 said ' there were numerous cues ' that the aircraft 's speed was slowing dangerously the co-pilot , who was training the pilot flying the plane , thought the auto - throttle on the @entity77 jet might not have been operating , the documents showed			1
the pilot flying the plane said he was n't sure whether the auto - throttle was maintaining speed , according to the documents			2
the low , slow landing caused the plane 's tail to hit a seawall short of the runway			0
the plane spun 330 degrees as it broke apart and caught fire , strewing wreckage along the runway			0
the @entity7 opened an investigative hearing into the causes of the crash in december and has been examining concerns about the auto - throttle .			2

airline says ' inadequate ' warning system failed to alert pilots to slow speed
the auto - throttle design has been blamed by @entity3 , an issue previously raised
