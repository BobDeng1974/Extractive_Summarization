by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:30 est , 3 may 2013 it would n't be too surprising to many if @entity4 were to be declared the most exciting city in the coutry , but when it does n't even make the top 5 , eyebrows are raised			1
the city that never sleeps was beaten by the city of @entity10 , in a list compiled by real estate blog @entity12			1
@entity10 , @entity14 beat all other major @entity16 cities however the website did n't ask for people 's opinions but instead claims it used a more scientific method			1
scroll down to see the full list ... appearances : it might not look it , but @entity10 is a really ' exciting ' place to be despite the fact that @entity4 is large and crammed with people and things to do , @entity25 instead decided to work out which city was best by using ten criteria that they believed make a city ' exciting			1
' the calculations took into account park acreage , percentage of young adults , low concentrations of big box stores and fast food restaurants , diversity of its population as well as bars , museums and movie theaters per square mile			0
@entity12 blogger @entity47 wrote : ' this is n't a perfect definition , but you can think of our list as ways to fight that ever - present boredom everyone faces at some point or another			1
' the @entity56 ended up coming in at number six whilst the city whose nickname is @entity61 came in at number one			0
too much of a good thing : the survey found that too many fast food restaurants make @entity4 less ' exciting ' @entity10 , @entity14 @entity67 , @entity66 @entity68 , @entity14 @entity69 , @entity70 @entity71 @entity4 , @entity4 @entity72 , @entity73 @entity74 , @entity75 @entity76 , @entity77 @entity78 , @entity79 @entity10 is often the subject of bad press because of its high crime rate			1
the city is usually seen as the poor sister to the city across the bay , @entity68			0
it came third in @entity25 's list			1
' when we think of an exciting place to live , we think about places where there is always something to do — whether it ’s eating at new restaurants or jogging through a park			2
depending on the category we looked at a criterion on a per - person or per - square - mile basis , ' the blog states			2
' to be very clear , we looked at each individual city ’s size ; this excludes suburbs or nearby cities			2
in other words , it ’s not covering an entire metro area			0
' @entity10 did best on it 's population diversity , museums per square mile and hip theater scene			2
even the @entity113 suggested @entity10 ranked amongst the ' @entity114 to visit ' last year			0
however , not everyone is impressed with @entity10 's new found fame			0
@entity10 - born playwright @entity117 told local hip hop blog 38th notes			0
' i take issue with the idea that @entity10 is worth visiting only because new has supplanted old ... that notion supposes that everything i ’ve loved about my city for the last 27 years is void , the [ @entity113 ] blurb invites those who would not otherwise be interested in the cultural backbone of my city to descend and take , as opposed to respectfully visit and interact			0
