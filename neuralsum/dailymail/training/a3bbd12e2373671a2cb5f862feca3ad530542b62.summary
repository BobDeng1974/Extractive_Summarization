by @entity0 only girls are allowed at a new workout class that promises fat - burning results in just half an hour			0
it 's called @entity5 and is based on the principles of high intensity interval training			1
women join exercise classes dependent on their fitness and follow a trainer telling them when to work hard and when to take short rests			1
the classes are all carried out barefoot and there 's a giant timer on the wall to help people keep up with when to work intensely and when to relax			1
sometimes body weight is used for resistance and on other occasions fitness ' toys ' such as medicine balls , sandbags , skipping ropes and trampettes are used			1
exercises such as burpees , press ups and sits ups are carried out as well as core stability moves like the plank			0
each class lasts half an hour but because it involves high intensity exercise , participants boost their metabolism so they keep on burning fat for hours afterwards			1
heavy lifting : fitness props like bags are used for weight resistance while the exercises themselves may not be anything new , @entity5 believe their female - only format and variety of different moves in each 30 minute session make them different			1
the classes were developed by fitness experts @entity62 and @entity63 who wanted to find a way to help busy women fit exercise into their lives			1
they also wanted to attract those who are intimidated by the macho vibe at some mixed gyms and wanted to work out in a more female - friendly space			0
@entity62 said : ' @entity5 started with a simple question , " how can busy women spend as little time as possible working out and still get amazing results ? " ' after speaking with lots of women it became clear that they simply did n't have the time or interest for endless cardio and expensive personal training			1
the majority wanted short and effective female - friendly workouts with inspiring trainers			2
' writer and actress @entity87 admits she is a @entity5 convert since she first tried the class last month and has been going to three classes a week			1
no need for trainers : all the classes are carried out barefoot she told @entity95 : ' i have been a member at a gym before and tried all sorts of different workouts but i needed something that was time efficient and easy to fit into my routine			1
' @entity5 is all beautifully contained - it allows me to pop in and out in half an hour and i know i 'm getting an intensive workout			1
it does n't feel like a gym or a fitness studio , it 's a lovely environment			2
' i do n't feel the sort of dread that i did with other workouts			2
knowing that you have to endure a long session with heavy weights or a long run is often off - putting but with this , you know that you only have to get through half an hour and that you 'll likely be doing something different to last time			0
it is exactly what i and many other women need - we 're done and dusted in 30 minutes			1
' @entity87 said it 's one of the toughest workouts she has ever done but she 's already noticing the results			1
she said : ' i noticed changes in my body shape after just a few weeks			2
my stomach is flatter and my clothes are looser			0
people are telling me that i 'm looking slimmer in my jeans which - let 's be honest - is what we all want to hear			0
convert : @entity87 , left , with @entity5 founder @entity132 ' i 'm definitely fitter			1
the exercise that has always crippled me is press ups and now i can do them			2
the plank was the other exercise i could never master but again , i can manage the full 30 seconds			1
' the 55 - year - old does n't weigh herself so she does n't know how many pounds she has shifted thanks to the workout			0
she said she prefers to focus on getting fitter and toning up than obsessing over the scales			2
she explained : ' any woman past the age of 19 has to think of things in terms of fitness and shape , not weight			2
i do n't weigh myself so i could n't say if i 've lost any weight but it 's not about that			0
i know my shape is changing and i 'm getting fitter			0
' @entity5 classes are held at three locations in @entity153 and at selected @entity155 stores around the country			1
for those in @entity159 , they opened the first @entity160 in @entity161 last month			0
for more information , visit @entity163 women are taking inspiration from super-fit olympians such as @entity168 and are hitting the gym in pursuit of washboard abs , a new survey has revealed			0
men , meanwhile , are looking towards the rugby fraternity and want powerful pecs similar to those displayed by @entity176 in 2012 film @entity178			2
but while stomachs and chests get plenty of attention , the backside , or glutes , is neglected with just three per cent of men and two per cent of women saying they do exercises designed to target them			0
now a spokesman for @entity191 , has warned that neglecting the buttocks could lead to a less than shapely physique			0
he said : ' the glutes often get ignored during workouts			0
if lunges , hip extensions and squats do n’t appeal to you , classes such as @entity197 and @entity198 are a great way to target problem areas			0
' some women do n’t like the idea of training with weights because they ’re worried it will give them bulging muscles , but resistance training is not only great for toning up but will also boost your fat burning efforts , ' he added .			0

@entity5 studios and classes are men free *zones*
