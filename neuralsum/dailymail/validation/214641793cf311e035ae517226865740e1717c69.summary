the co-pilot blamed for deliberately crashing a passenger jet with 150 people on board into the @entity4 used post- 9/11 safety mechanisms to carry out his plan			0
@entity7 , 28 , waited for his captain , @entity9 to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the @entity12 320 to descend			0
once out of the cockpit , the door locked automatically			2
ironically , this auto - lock feature , which led to @entity7 having sole control of the plane , was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11			1
the door was also specially strengthened , to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through			0
the safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft			2
access to the cockpit door on the @entity49 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking in normal flight , the door to the flight is closed and locked			1
cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck			1
entry is controlled by the flight crew , in case of a possible hijack attempt			2
the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) according to the flight manual ' provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door '			1
the @entity63 is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door			0
they also have a @entity73 camera so they can see who is seeking access , and if they are under any form of duress			0
pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency			1
however , this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes			2
the limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature , in case the flight crew become incapacitated			1
after the predetermined time , the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again , unless the pilot actively restricts access again			1
also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open			1
according to the flight manual there are ' routine ' and ' emergency ' access requests			0
the door locking mechanism is on the centre console , pictured , so it can be operated by either pilot the pilot has to flick one simple switch , pictured , to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes ' the toggle switch enables the flight crew to lock or unlock the cockpit door , following an access request , thereby allowing or denying the entry to the cockpit			1
' the flight manual states that the control unit is responsible for : on the @entity22 , there are three settings : school friends said that @entity7 paused his pilot 's training in 2008 after suffering from ' burnout ' and depression			1
on november 29 , 2013 @entity126 crashed on a scheduled passenger flight between @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , @entity131			0
air crash investigators think the @entity134 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet , killing everyone			0
the jet 's captain , @entity140 was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death			0
@entity145 crashed into the ground , pictured , after the pilot locked his colleague , who went on a toilet break , out of the flight deck before commanding it to crash from 38,000 feet when his co-pilot went to the toilet , flight data information recovered from the scene found that @entity140 manually changed the aircraft 's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level			0
he also pushed the aircraft 's throttles back to idle and selected the jet 's maximum operating speed			0
chillingly , the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door , similar to captain @entity9 's attempts to regain access to the flight deck .			2

since 9/11 all passenger jets are required to lock the cockpit door in flight
cabin crew can gain access using a special code - but pilots can stop this
however , the lock is on a timer in case the pilots are incapacitated
@entity7 paused his pilot training after suffering ' burnout ' and depression
