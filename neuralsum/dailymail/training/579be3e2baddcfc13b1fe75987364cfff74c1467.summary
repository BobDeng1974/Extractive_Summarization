by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is hoping that some of @entity5 ’s recently - acquired magic dust can be sprinkled on him as he tries to mount a first successful run at a @entity7 since @entity8 last year			1
after five days ’ training ahead of the @entity11 , the 27 - year - old @entity9 took time off on friday to watch @entity5 in action in nearby @entity13 before spending the evening courtside at @entity15 to see the @entity17 basketball team play			1
he also had dinner in @entity19 with @entity5 earlier this week , the two sportsmen having a strong understanding of what it is like to be each other			2
i have never been to watch golf live before , ’ @entity2 said ‘ so , you know , for a first experience , watching the best player in the world was pretty good			1
‘ i really enjoyed it			2
i guess it ’s like pretty much any sport — when you watch them up close it ’s impressive			2
then in the evening , i went to the basketball , which i love watching			2
but this time to sit that close and see those guys			2
they ’re huge guys , but just unbelievably quick , great @entity72 was a fun day for me			0
’ @entity2 may be an avid sports fan but that passion will probably not extend to watching his mother @entity74 in @entity75 , after it was confirmed this week that she will take part in this winter ’s competition			1
‘ i mean , if it makes her happy , then i will support her , ’ he smiled			0
‘ i ’m not really into those shows , but she loves it			0
i mean , she watches it all the of the time , talks about it all the time			0
so , yeah , if she enjoys it , then i ’m happy for her			0
i do n’t believe i have ever seen her dance , to be honest			0
’ the serious business starts tomorrow for the now no 8 seed , when he takes on @entity93 @entity92 in the @entity94 , where he has had plenty of difficult matches before			0
joking aside : @entity2 and @entity42 have enjoyed a relaxed relationship scowl : @entity2 lost to @entity99 in the quarter - finals of the @entity101 @entity92 described his knee as being like that of a 60 or 70 - year - old , but he can manage the condition			1
he expressed surprise that @entity2 has hired @entity42 as coach , although not because she is a woman			1
‘ for me it ’s a surprise that many tennis players work with ex-tennis players now			0
for example , i would n’t work with an ex-professional just because they have no experience as a coach			1
‘ when you are no 1 , 2 or 3 in the world , you want to improve maybe those things you can only find in an ex-player so i totally understand , and if that ’s a woman or a man , i think that does n’t make a huge difference			1
i would have never done it , although that ’s me			0
” @entity2 has enjoyed her more consensual , attentive approach but his fellow former @entity8 champion from last year , @entity124 , is warning against people misinterpreting @entity42 as some kind of soft touch			1
‘ she is not someone who is soft all the time , definitely not , ’ said @entity124 — commentating for @entity130 this week — who has been coached herself by @entity42			1
‘ if something was wrong she was making her point strongly that it was wrong and that i or my team - mates needed to correct it			0
she is not a soft person , maybe she is making you feel comfortable but when you were n’t doing your best or i was having a lack of concentration she made sure i was back on track , really making a point of it			0
let 's celebrate : @entity42 helped guide @entity124 ( right ) to the @entity8 title in 2013 girl power : @entity147 will be flying the flag for @entity150 's female players at @entity151 ‘ i can only speak from my own experience but when i was with her at a @entity154 tie or some time together at @entity8 she ’s very funny and can make a few jokes			1
it was an easy relationship and the flow was going extremely well , but then again when it was out on court it was all about concentration and making sure everyone was focused on the goal of winning the match			0
‘ there was a time for fun and a time for business and she was able to separate the two			0
’ @entity124 always expected @entity42 to require ‘ two to three months ’ to settle in with @entity2 as she would need to learn about the men ’s tour			1
‘ the men ’s and women ’s games are different but i do think people should be judged on their ability to do the job			0
for me it ’s never been a problem of female or male in coaching , it ’s more about your own capabilities			2
’ in the absence of @entity184 , who is still recovering from her long - term wrist injury , @entity147 will fly the @entity150 flag in the women ’s singles in the company of @entity190			1
@entity147 , who plays @entity192 ’s @entity191 , has improved this summer after last year ’s bout of glandular fever , to the point where she is ranked 45 in the world			2
the @entity197 — who recently beat the world no 12 @entity199 of @entity200 — feels much happier about her prospects than she was 12 months ago			2
she said : ‘ i was kind of dreading my match then because i came in with zero matches , but i ’m a different player now , more aggressive and my confidence is up			0
@entity205 have an unrivalled schedule of sport this autumn , including @entity11 tennis , @entity209 , the @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity213 2016 qualifiers , rugby union @entity214 and @entity216 .			1

@entity2 is preparing for the @entity11 at @entity151 , @entity37
@entity150 no 1 has been working with female coach @entity42
former world no 1 @entity42 helped @entity124 to @entity8 *victory*
@entity124 says that @entity42 will not be *afraid* to get tough with @entity2
