by @entity0 for @entity1 neanderthals and modern humans both lived in @entity4 at the same time for up 5,400 years - and may have interbred			1
new research - looking at a period dating back 40,000 years - claims @entity2 disappeared at different times , instead of being suddenly replaced by modern humans , as previously thought			1
scientists used new dating evidence for 200 bone , charcoal and shell samples from 40 key @entity4 sites to prove the two groups overlapped for a significant period of time			2
neanderthals and modern humans both lived in @entity4 between 2,600 and 5,400 years , according to new research , which analysed neanderthal remains and tools			1
neanderthal foot bones found in @entity22 are shown it is the first time that researchers have constructed a timeline showing when the last @entity2 died out			1
because they and modern humans overlapped for a significant period , there was ‘ ample time ’ for interaction and interbreeding , experts said			0
neanderthals were a human sub-species distantly related to , but genetically different from , modern humans , or homo sapiens			0
they had already been living in @entity4 for hundreds of thousands of years when the first modern humans migrated out of @entity38			2
professor @entity40 , @entity41 in @entity42 , the @entity43 , @entity39 said that interbreeding probably occurred soon after small groups of modern humans began to leave their @entity48 homeland about 60,000 years ago			1
it is thought @entity2 died out because they were unable to compete with our ancestors for food and resources			0
experts now think that @entity2 disappeared at different times across @entity4 instead of suddenly being replaced by modern humans a team led by the @entity58 dated the samples from sites that ranged from @entity22 to @entity61			1
all of them were linked with the @entity2 tool - making industry , known as @entity64 , or were ‘ transitional ’ sites containing stone tools ( pictured ) associated with either early modern humans or @entity2 it is commonly thought that @entity2 died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources			1
the new research now suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred			0
experts believe that @entity2 ‘ may have survived in dwindling pockets of @entity4 ’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct , instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans			1
the study did n’t cover eastern regions such as @entity79 and @entity80 , where @entity2 are also known to have lived			0
‘ so it is still possible @entity2 lingered later in some areas , ’ professor @entity40 said			0
‘ overall pattern seems clear – the @entity2 had largely , and perhaps entirely , vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago			2
’ a severe @entity86 event between 39,000 and 40,000 years ago , meant that cold and dry conditions hit @entity4			2
‘ it remains to be seen whether that event delivered the @entity90 to a @entity2 population that was already low in numbers and genetic diversity , and trying to cope with economic competition from incoming groups of @entity96 , ’ professor @entity40 said			0
a team led by the @entity58 , dated the samples from sites that ranged from @entity22 to @entity61			0
all of them were linked with the @entity2 tool - making industry , known as @entity64 , or were ‘ transitional ’ sites containing stone tools associated with either early modern humans or @entity2			1
this tool making industry ended between 39,260 and 41,030 years ago , and suggests the overlap between @entity2 and modern humans			1
the study claims that @entity2 ‘ may have survived in dwindling pockets of @entity4 ’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct			2
it took experts six years to build mathematical models that combined the new radiocarbon dates with established archaeological evidence , according to the study , published in the journal @entity118			0
lead researcher professor @entity119 , from @entity58 , said : previous radiocarbon dates have often underestimated the age of samples from sites associated with @entity2 because the organic matter was contaminated with modern particles			2
‘ we used ultrafiltration methods , which purify the extracted collagen from bone , to avoid the risk of modern contamination			0
‘ this means we can say with more confidence that we have finally resolved the timing of the disappearance of our close cousins , the @entity2			0
‘ of course the @entity2 are not completely extinct because some of their genes are in most of us today			0
’ the study suggests that @entity2 ‘ may have survived in dwindling pockets of @entity4 ’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct			1
here , researchers examine samples found in a @entity22 cave because @entity2 and modern humans overlapped for a significant period , there was ‘ ample time ’ for interaction and interbreeding , experts said			1
the heavy jawbone of a @entity2 is pictured the study shows that @entity2 did interbreed over a sustained period of time , the researchers say			0
but they are unsure where interbreeding may have happened in @entity157 , or whether it occurred once or several times			0
‘ significant interbreeding between @entity2 and early modern humans had probably already occurred in @entity160 more than 50,000 years ago , so the dating evidence now indicates that the two populations could have been in some kind of contact with each other for up to 20,000 years , first in @entity160 then later in @entity4 , ’ professor @entity40			1
‘ this may support the idea that some of the changes in @entity2 and early modern human technology after 60,000 years ago can be attributed to a process of acculturation between these two human groups			2
’ lead researcher professor @entity119 , from @entity58 , said : ‘ previous radiocarbon dates have often underestimated the age of samples from sites associated with @entity2 - because the organic matter was contaminated with modern particles			1
' here , researchers examine remains of @entity64 and modern human levels in a cave in @entity185			0

experts made the first timeline showing when the last @entity2 died
@entity58 study suggests @entity2 died out at different times across @entity4 , instead of suddenly being replaced by modern humans
experts dated 200 samples from 40 @entity4 @entity2 tool - making sites
tool making industry ended between 39,260 and 41,030 years ago , suggesting an overlap between @entity2 and modern humans
