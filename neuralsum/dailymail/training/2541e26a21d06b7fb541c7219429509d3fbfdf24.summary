@entity0 has been forced to delete seven sarcastic videos mocking @entity3 's latest range of @entity4			1
in a series of spoofs titled ' a fly on the wall in @entity9 ? ' , two actors make ludicrous and dumb suggestions to a man supposed to be @entity3 ceo @entity13 in the firm 's @entity15 headquarters			1
their list of pretentious colours , including ' vermillion ' , ' chartreuse ' , and ' robins egg ' , is a dig at the new range of multi-coloured @entity4 - and @entity3 's notoriously ' trendy ' image			1
in poor taste : @entity0 deleted the advert that mocked @entity3 @entity3 chief executive @entity13 praises the new @entity28 as the most refined model ever made colours aside , they took aim at every element of the controversial new design , including the fingerprint reader and megapixel camera			1
at one point , the actress hands a piece of @entity41 paper to ' t ' ( @entity13 ) : ' feel how light that is			2
you know how we did that ? @entity47 - got them down to eight			2
' picking apart mr @entity13 's speech at the launch on wednesday , the actors make fun of phrases such as ' the gold standard ' and ' unapologetically plastic '			1
but after an onslaught of criticism , the rival phone company conceded to remove the clips			0
a statement released by @entity0 said : ' the video was intended to be a light - hearted poke at our friends from @entity9			2
but it was off the mark , and we ’ve decided to pull it down			2
' tech bloggers have rushed to berate the videos , which feature a @entity69 lookalike as @entity13			2
writing for @entity71 , @entity70 said : ' poking fun at @entity3 ’s various colors is perhaps @entity0 ’s way of saying , “ hey , we thought of this first ” , but it ’s just comes across as bewildering			1
' video sourced by @entity77 and @entity78 @entity0 ceo , right , @entity81 's company apologised for the stunt mocking @entity3 , run by @entity13 , right one commenter on @entity84 said : ' these @entity0 ads are n’t funny or entertaining at all , i do n’t get it			1
' another tweeted : ' pathetic and offensive ? ' one video went viral before @entity0 managed to delete it			1
it opens with one of the colour - coordinated ' ideas people ' poking fun at the @entity95 , which is still yet to hit the market after numerous mentions			0
the actor says : ' sorry we 're late			0
my @entity95 had to go back to @entity101 [ research and development ]			0
' he proceeds to suggest random colours , with a flourish of his wrist , for the ceo to think about - while his colleague ' translates ' them into layman 's terms : ' @entity113 , do you feel me ? ' ' @entity114			2
' ' @entity115 ' ' @entity116			0
' ' @entity117 ' ' @entity118			0
' the actress also translates ' yeah bro ' to ' yes ' , and ' nah brah ' to ' no '			0
he continues to mock how the model falls short of its description : ' you asked us to make the gold standard of @entity28			0
it turns out that is super hard			0
' we made you an iphone which is the colour gold '			0
in what was classed as a ' make or break ' event for @entity3 , the tech firm unveiled a cut - price handset called the @entity134 as well as a high - end model called @entity28			1
the release of the @entity134 marks a step away from @entity3 's luxe image			1
many believe the move is a desperate bid to poach @entity143 buyers , as the @entity146 company and its plastic , cheaper handsets go from strength to strength .			0
