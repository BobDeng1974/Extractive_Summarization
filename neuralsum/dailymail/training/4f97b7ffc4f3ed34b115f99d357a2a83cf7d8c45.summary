@entity9 , who is disabled , made a telephone bid of £ 154,500 for the house in @entity12 in february 2010 , without viewing it or having a survey done			1
but just eight days after the auction , a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea , and signalled the started of a lengthy legal battle			1
on the brink : @entity23 in @entity12 where a huge chunk of the garden fell away from the cliff , six days after the house had been sold the scene at @entity29 , @entity12 , where a huge chuck of retired police officer @entity9 's garden fell away from the cliff , eight days after the house had been sold miss @entity9 says the house is uninhabitable and worth only £ 3,500			1
she has been engaged in a legal war with the builder who sold it to her , @entity39 , who has been reduced to living in a caravan while the dispute has dragged on			0
the view from the front of @entity23 , which sits just 50ft from the cliff edge in @entity12 onlookers survey the 5,000 tons of rubble which fell away from the cliff by the six - bedroom property overlooking @entity29 in @entity12 , @entity51 the auction particulars warned buyers that the six - bedroom house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair , and a judge in 2010 ordered @entity57 to pay mr @entity39 what she owed			1
mr @entity39 has a legal charge for the money , plus 8 per cent interest annually , over @entity57 ’s home in @entity63 , @entity64 , which she says is worth over £ 1million			2
in december 2011 , @entity57 was evicted from her home so it could be sold and mr @entity39 paid			0
however , @entity64 ’s @entity67 heard that she later went back there despite what she described as its ‘ uninhabitable state ’			0
the saga continued in march this year when a judge gave mr @entity39 permission to market the property at £ 650,000 – but that brought protests from @entity57 who said that was only half its true value			0
now mr justice @entity82 has given @entity57 the chance to get a better price for her home after she produced letters from estate agents saying £ 1.1million was ‘ easily achievable ’			0
miss @entity9 , the judge said , suffered from dyslexia , impaired hearing and restricted mobility			0
explaining her decision to buy the house in @entity12 , she said her @entity63 home had been flooded by burst pipes and she thought the ground floor of the seaside property would be ideal for a disabled person .			2
