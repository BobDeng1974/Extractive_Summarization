@entity12 @entity29 tweeted that senator @entity8 was refusing bond and would be spending the night in jail fervent : a woman holds up a sign protesting the treatment of black people by law enforcement during monday evening 's protests a grand jury is considering charges against @entity55 , who has not spoken publicly about the matter			1
protesters want @entity55 arrested immediately and have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor			1

@entity79 , @entity7 's aunt , said she believes the cop committed murder and will suffer retribution in a ' mighty way '			0
she described @entity55 's actions as ' evil ' and said will be punished by a higher power for what he did - even if he is cleared			1
her comments are the most outspoken yet from @entity7 's family since @entity55 's account of what happened was published in the @entity92 at the weekend			1
the testimony - and alleged forensic evidence - has been described by experts as helpful to his defense and has provoked fresh outrage from the teenager 's family and supporters			0
' self defense ' : @entity4 police officer @entity55 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity7 anger : @entity79 , left , with husband @entity41 , told @entity73 that @entity55 will suffer retribution in a ' mighty way ' struggle : according to @entity111 analysis @entity7 's blood was found inside officer @entity55 's patrol car			1
the cop claims he wrestled with @entity7 in the car and was in fear of his life			0
but the account is disputed @entity55 shot dead @entity7 , 18 , on august 9 , in @entity4 , a suburb of @entity118 in @entity1 , sparking nearly two weeks of violent protests and rioting			1
unrest has continued since then as a grand jury decides whether it will indict @entity55			1
a decision is expected next month			0
speaking to @entity124 said : ' it 's murder and they will feel and see the wrath of @entity76 's vengeance come upon them in a mighty way , just as he promised all who do evil in his sight			0
' @entity55 's account gave the first insight into what he told the grand jury during his four - hour testimony in september , a process which is held in secret			2
he supposedly said that @entity7 pushed him back into his police suv as he was trying to get out and pinned him down			0
at that point @entity55 reached for his gun and fired two shots , one of which hit @entity7 - his blood was found inside the car			2
the account did not explain why @entity55 then shot @entity7 five more times in the front as , according to some witnesses , he put his hands in the air to surrender			2
@entity8 , center , pictured protesting @entity7 's shooting at a rally outside the @entity157 , in @entity158 , on 28 august solidarity : protesters are pictured here in @entity4 monday night continuing a vigil for @entity7 tensions : police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again , more than two months after the shooting @entity7 's supporters are worried that @entity55 is trying to exploit the law in @entity1 which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat			1
@entity55 's account also flatly contradicts that of a number of witnesses including @entity7 's friend @entity179 , who was standing next to him at the time			2
@entity179 has said that @entity55 was the aggressor and grabbed @entity7 's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot			2
but another witness , whose name has been withheld , has also reportedly told the grand jury that @entity7 did not have his hands above his head when @entity55 shot him but instead they were ' out to his sides			2
' he also said @entity7 ' staggered toward @entity55 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			2
' among those who have already spoken out to attack @entity55 's statement is @entity196 , the attorney for @entity7 's family			2
memorial : neighbors wait by a memorial set up on @entity26 , @entity200 - the spot where @entity7 was killed he has said that @entity55 's account should ' not be taken as gospel '			2
he said : ' he can say what he wants to say in front of a jury			0
they can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody			0
' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid			0
' the @entity215 also called it a ‘ @entity218 defense , ' referring the @entity220 man who was convicted of shooting dead a black teenager because he was playing music too loudly			0
@entity215 has said : ' it did n't work in @entity220 and it should n't work in @entity1 ’			0
residents of @entity4 fear that violence could return to their streets if @entity55 is not indicted - which is a very real possibility			2
the @entity92 reported that , according to officials with knowledge of the grand jury hearing , the forensic evidence does appear to support @entity55 's account			0
another issue is the potential civil rights prosecution brought by the federal government after attorney general @entity235 began an @entity111 investigation			0
condemnation : @entity215 on sunday hit out at @entity55 's version of events			0
and the @entity7 family lawyer , @entity196 , said : ' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid ' @entity244 , a professor at the @entity245 in @entity118 , has told @entity73 that a charge of civil rights abuse would be a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter			0
he said that this is because the jury would have to be certain @entity55 intended to violate @entity7 's civil rights by shooting him dead			1
he said : ' the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse			0
' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like murder			0
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0
