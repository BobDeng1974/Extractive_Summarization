until now , filming underwater has required teams of divers and expensive underwater camera rigs - but a new @entity5 - controlled robot does the lot itself			1
the battery - powered @entity7 shoots in @entity8 and swims independently , letting users see through its eyes with an app that works on @entity5 , smartphones and @entity14 laptops			1
the $ 4,000 machine comes with a 75 - foot cable and battery pack that lets it ' swim ' for three hours - its makers suggest the tiny submarine could be used to find lost keys underwater , or for underwater documentaries			2
it can also capture information on water conditions			0
the @entity7 costs $ 4,000 - more prosaically , you can also ' explore the depths ' with a camera mounted on a boat hook for just $ 475			0
the @entity27 communicates wirelessly from the user ’s handheld device to the @entity27 ’s top - side box , which is in - turn connected to the submersible via a cable tether			2
tthe @entity27 measures just 14.6x19x7 inches and weighs nine pounds - and the finished model shoots in @entity8 , although the early demo video below is in lower definition			1
‘ every kid dreams of exploring the oceans but few of us truly experience life under the sea			0
now , with the @entity27 , if you can operate an @entity5 you can ply the depths like @entity60 , ’ said @entity52 , ceo of @entity7			1
‘ whether you are a charter boat owner looking to entertain your guests , a commercial captain looking to confirm vessel conditions below the waterline or a first responder looking for a quick and safe way to survey a submerged scene , the @entity27 delivers a safe and dry , up - close experience with the underwater world			0
