by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 believes he can step straight in to @entity4 ’s midfield in the wake of @entity7 ’s retirement – but is confident he could also do a job at centre - back for his country			1
@entity2 watched @entity4 ’s horror show in @entity12 with a sense of frustration having found himself out of the @entity4 picture following two seasons on the fringes at @entity18			1
he signed for @entity19 this week in a £ 10million deal – where he has been guaranteed a start in the middle of the park – and the 23 - year - old wants a place in @entity27 ’s squad for this month ’s friendly with @entity28			1
moving backwards : @entity19 's @entity2 believes he can do a job for @entity4 at centre - half mover : the former @entity18 man joined the @entity19 for £ 10million last week ‘ for me , it was difficult to watch ( the @entity36 ) because i wanted to be there so much , ’ said the three - times capped former @entity34 man			1
‘ now i want to be back in it - that ’s why i signed here			2
’ and @entity2 is confident of winning that call , regardless of the position			1
‘ i ’d back myself to get back in at centre - midfield and i believe i could at centre - back , ’ he added			2
it is in midfield , however , where he would prefer to influence matches			0
‘ i ’m here ( at @entity19 ) as a central midfielder , ’ he said			1
‘ i have n’t played centre - back since i was 16 really			2
but you never know , maybe one day i might step back when i ’ve got no legs			0
‘ i ’m wasted if i play there though			0
i think i ’ve got more to offer than playing centre - back – it ’s boring as well			0
’ in the wake of @entity4 ’s worst - ever showing at a @entity36 finals , it was suggested that players could benefit from escaping the @entity57 and broadening their horizons overseas			0
that , however , is not for @entity2 , despite several offers			1
‘ i need to be seen here playing regularly if i want to get back into the @entity4 team , but maybe in the future ( i ’d go abroad ) , ’ he said			0
‘ never say never , but at the moment the @entity57 is where it ’s happening			0
that ’s where you will be written about			0
’ @entity2 has followed the path of new team - mate @entity69 in fleeing @entity18 in search of regular football			1
and he hopes @entity27 will pay more visits to the @entity73 than the sole one he managed last season			2
‘ i ’d like @entity27 to see as many games as he could , obviously , and i think @entity69 was a little bit unlucky not to have got into the squad for the @entity36 , ’ he went on			2
‘ he had a very good end to the season , so hopefully the manager will get up here as much as possible			0
