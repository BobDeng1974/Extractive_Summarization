based in @entity13 , @entity14 , will transport guests back to the 1940s , in a bid to bring @entity20 ’s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life			1
the pair are owners of the @entity50 bar and @entity52 ’s nightclub , which is inspired by @entity53 and thought that as the @entity20 venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter , it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar			1
@entity33 of @entity60 said : ' we decided to open @entity62 , after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war @entity64 , and the venue 's own extraordinary heritage			0
' the site was formerly @entity68 , an out - of - hours drinking club , first opened in 1917 by a group of @entity73 officers			0
' it was also used as a bomb shelter during @entity11 and the wartime membership book contains names such as @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
with @entity62 we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors			1
' first timers are greeted by the station master , in character , at the entry kiosk and issued a ‘ day ticket ’ to enter the underground station during the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick - nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids			1
to bring @entity102 to life , the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real @entity2 fabrics , and leather from the period			1
they also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations			0
if the decor is not enough to inspire a visit , the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced £ 7 - £ 9			1
chose to indulge in @entity120 - style cocktails , drinks served in @entity121 , milk bottles , as well as new variations of old favourites			0
alternatively the impressive @entity14 signature cocktail is the @entity126 , which has a working face , and serves eight for £ 150			0
bottoms up ! you are spoilt for choice at @entity62 with eight pages of cocktails including the @entity132 ( £ 10 )			2
inspired by gimlets , it is made from @entity136 vodka , garden peas , lime juice , basil , agave syrup , and a @entity141 champagne foam when you arrive at the @entity20 location , you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage even the staff are dressed in character , with 1946 outfits , accents , nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar			1
another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly - lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth , which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity			2
the surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s - style singer and musicians , with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future			0
