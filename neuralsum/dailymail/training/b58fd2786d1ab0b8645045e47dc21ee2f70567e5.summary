to the chairman of @entity2 nights with the directors of @entity4 are not the occasions they once were			1
@entity7 should be comfortable in the midst of @entity9 and co. he was once one of them			1
vice-chairman of the company indeed			1
but these days he neither recognises the faces or names of the @entity4 board			1
or , indeed , the ' new entity ' – his words – that they represent			1
@entity4 vice chairman @entity7 believes the @entity19 outfit are almost like a new side @entity7 believes @entity22 's side is almost like a new team following their relegation to the lower leagues ' welcoming them to @entity27 will be no different to welcoming anyone else for me , ' @entity7 tells @entity30 , a vague waft of pipe tobacco detectable in windowless side room in @entity35 's @entity34			1
' why should it be ? ' i do n't have many old friends there now			1
none on the organisational side			1
' i know @entity22 and @entity41			2
but i do n't actually know who is involved there any more			2
' @entity4 coming is a big occasion for the club and the town of course			1
the last time they played @entity2 in a league game was april 1971			2
the game was originally scheduled to have been played on january 9 – but was postponed because it was the saturday after the @entity19 disaster			2
' this appreciation of the history of @entity4 is a feature of the conversation			1
@entity7 , trademark whiskers now greying slightly , is wistful on the past and shows no compunction over turning his legal mind to one of the most heated and prolonged debates in @entity65 football			1
his learned friend @entity66 may have declared otherwise			2
but to @entity7 the @entity4 which visits @entity2 on tuesday is not the same @entity4 he once served			1
' it is a different club , ' he tells @entity30 bluntly			1
' they may play at @entity19 and they may play sometimes in royal blue jerseys			2
' but you can not pass on that which is undefinable			2
and that is spirit and tradition and all the rest of it			2
' to me this is a new @entity4 which has to establish its own history and tradition			1
but it 's not the @entity4 i know			1
to me , genuinely , it is a new entity			2
' @entity7 feels sorry for fans of the @entity19 side who have stuck by their club in recent years in @entity4 circles this kind of thing is heresy			1
when liquidation became inevitable @entity89 , the former chief executive , insisted vocally he had paid £ 5.5million for the assets and history of the oldco in may 2012			2
recently , @entity94 's programmed editor lost his job after wading into a contentious topic in a match programme			2
asked why he flies in the face of the consensus among @entity4 supporters - that they remain the same club they always were - @entity7 insists his view is a personal one			1
in his mind – he is now 63 – things have changed			2
' well , the view i have is one expressed to me by a lot of other @entity4 supporters			1
' there is just not the same sense of things being done the @entity4 way			1
' a lot of @entity4 supporters – and these are the guys i feel sorry for – paid their money and remained loyal and followed the team through thick and thin			1
and they tell me there is just something missing now			2
' that 's not only my view			2
it 's what i am told by people from the inside in the sense that they go to @entity19			2
something has changed , something is missing			2
it 's just somehow … different			2
' this sense of creeping disenfranchisement with the running of @entity4 is not unusual			1
among fan groups talk of boycott is now rife			2
suggesting that a club playing at @entity19 in blue jerseys before @entity4 supporters might be a ' new ' @entity4 , however , triggers a fresh stream of consciousness in one of @entity65 's great adversaries			1
the former believes @entity4 should not move away from @entity19 as the ground is steeped in history ' you can buy assets , ' he concedes , ' but you ca n't buy history			1
you ca n't buy tradition			2
history and tradition are in the heart and in the mind			2
you ca n't buy that			2
' i do n't care what anyone @entity163 can not buy @entity19 , you can not buy the @entity164 , you can not buy the trophy room without actually understanding what it means			0
' i mean what every little piece of it means right down to the crests on the radiators in the @entity164 that were made in the same shipyards which made the queen elizabeth liners			0
' there is the sense that @entity7 , a formidable adversary and hired gun paid to represent some of the most notorious criminals in the country , has given this some thought			1
' you could argue that if they ( @entity4 ) had moved from @entity19 to a brand new stadium at the time the whole thing collapsed , called it @entity184 and played in blue that you would automatically be taking all that history and tradition with you			1
' well , maybe some people can			0
' but for me personally tradition and history is in here			0
' he jabs a finger on his left hand towards his heart , an imprint on his black waistcoat clearly evident			0
' it 's not in material things			0
it 's understanding what the material things mean			0
' it 's understanding what a genuine privilege it was to walk up the marble staircase			0
' not every @entity212 should trail up the marble staircase at @entity19 you know			0
' in recent years , of course , a long process of @entity216 have done just that			0
@entity7 wo n't be drawn on what he thinks of this			1
' so i 'm told , ' is all he offers			0
he walked up the stairs for the last time 15 years ago			0
the events which led to a humiliating public resignation have been well documented			0
captured on camera at a club function singing ' @entity227 ' he was subsequently reported to considered suicide			1
he has no wish to rake over old coals			0
' it 's so far in the past i 'm not going back there			0
things happen to you , you deal with them and move on			0
' he has revelled in running his hometown club of @entity2 for the last five , fraught years on a simple rule of thumb			1
frustrated by the lack of media attention – ' your paper and others treat us like s * * * ' - the @entity248 club spend only what they earn			1
asked if the history of @entity4 might have been different if he had hung around longer to espouse this manta he is mildly dismissive			1
' ach , i do n't know			0
i ca n't say if i could have changed things if i had stayed @entity255 people have come and gone since then making decisions of which i know very little about			0
' @entity4 , he claims , were living within their means when he left			1
the more extravagant spending of the @entity262 years had yet to begin			0
' the budget at that time was managed and in control and covered			0
if you are taking a financial risk it has to be against a background of knowing you can cover that risk			0
' he wo n't deny that the spending at @entity19 was far higher than anywhere else			0
@entity4 unashamedly ' lorded it ' over their rivals , including @entity277 , and savoured every minute			1
one reason , he believes , why there was a marked lack of sympathy among rival clubs when they hurtled towards the fiscal cliff two and a half years ago			0
' looking back on it you do think that sometimes what goes around comes around			0
' i mean , come on …			0
to win nine championships in a row ? you are entitled to lord it a bit over the opposition then - and i think we did			0
' you knew perfectly well that when you were beaten and your opponents said ' thank you very much ' that the minute you left the room they would be aiming a one arm salute at your back			0
' there was a terrific relationship with the old @entity277 board you know			0
there was nothing personal about it			0
@entity306 and others were personal friends			0
' but , yes , it probably did heighten the sense of schadenfreude two years ago			0
but it was definitely good for business			0
' @entity7 is not sure if the current crop of @entity4 star will be able to win promotion back to the @entity317 @entity4 will have to beat off competition from @entity319 and @entity320 if they are going to earn promotion the presence of @entity4 in the championship is equally good for business for @entity2 now			1
@entity7 is under no illusions their presence is a short term situation			1
how short term is the million dollar question			0
' is it inevitable @entity4 will go up this season ? absolutely not			1
' i said that before the season started			0
there is absolutely no guarantee @entity4 will go up , far from it			1
' they would be one of the favourites from the play - offs because of the resources they potentially have			0
' but @entity4 , @entity319 and @entity320 ? one of them will be in the @entity324 next year - guaranteed			1
@entity342 and @entity343 are also ambitious clubs			0
' so it 's by no means guaranteed @entity4 will go up			1
' i could be selfish and say that suits me fine			0
i want them for another season in the championship but for the good of the wider game in @entity65 it 's time @entity4 were back in the @entity317			1
' he is unrepentant on this			0
@entity4 and @entity277 , he believes , are simply too big to fail in a @entity65 context			1
' they are not just football clubs – they are national institutions			0
' they have a presence in sport and also make a contribution to the economy which is huge			0
' of course it 's sad to see a great club the way it is			1
to see @entity4 reduced is heart - breaking			1
' people lost a lot of money and something had to be done about that			0
it was wrong the way small businesses and shareholders lost money			0
' but has it benefitted the game @entity184 being in the lower divisions ? is the game better because of it ? i 'm not sure it is you know … '			0

@entity7 feels sorry for @entity4 fans who have stuck by the club
the former vice chairman does not know if @entity4 will be promoted
@entity7 is saddened to see a great club *struggle*
