october and november are usually the months when @entity1 women breathe a sigh of relief			1
the colder months and lack of beach time mean we can reach for that extra chocolate hobnob and hang up the razor			2
but sadly , the @entity9 wo n't be going into retirement just yet - there 's a new trend for wearing bare legs all of the way through the winter months			1
@entity15 and @entity16 are pioneering the @entity18 / 14 fashion of tight-less legs , no matter how cold the weather gets			1
here is @entity15 at the face of an @entity24 ' film premiere in @entity25 on october 18 stars like @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity27 are pioneering the new fashion for naked pins			1
despite the weather taking a drastic dip in the last couple of weeks , there has barely been a single pair of opaque tights spotted on the legs of a-listers in @entity25 and @entity38			1
it 's a brave decision and not one to be made at the last minute - bare legs in late autumn require a number of preparations			1
they include round - the - clock taxis , streak - free tan , a spare pair of emergency socks and leggings and totally fuzz - free calves			1
@entity27 wore a warm leather jacket to walk the red carpet at the @entity53 , @entity55 film premiere in @entity25 on october 6 , but decided against tights the @entity58 desk are divided on the trend , so here two of the team give their reasons for and against in the battle of the winter hosiery : ' it 's all very well for models like @entity27 and @entity15 to be wandering around @entity25 in november with their pins out , but this is n't an easy trend for us mere mortals			1
' it 's hard enough already to get out of bed on a november morning - a fifteen - minute trek to the tube with my calves bared to the wind and rain would mean the alarm clock never moved off snooze			1
' it is n't just the comfort though , nothing slims the leg faster than some black hosiery , in fact , it favours curvier girls over stick insects			2
' on top of that , they allow a girl to wear short skirts that would look extremely tarty if accompanied with acres of fleshy thigh			2
' this is definitely a trend that is best left to stars and their monthly holidays abroad for tan top - ups , @entity104 diets and chauffeur - driven limos			1
' finally , if it 's good enough for the @entity108 , it 's good enough for me			2
' ' of course i wear tights			0
a cheap and easy way to stay warm and – more importantly – hide winter legs			0
' and this is my problem with them			0
as well as being entirely unsexy , tights are lazy			0
they are the sartorial equivalent of scraping your hair back when you know you should have washed it but ran out of time			0
' which is fine every once in a while but they absolutely should n’t be a key part of your wardrobe in autumn / winter / whenever			0
' women with bare legs look more put together and definitely more stylish			2
you would n’t find @entity132 , @entity133 or @entity134 rocking a bobbly opaque			2
' the good news : going tightless does n’t have to mean acres of bare legs for those of us without supermodel pins			0
trousers , jeans , midi skirts = all acceptable non-tarty ways to not wear tights when the temperatures dip a bit			0
' so there ’s really no excuse to choose the easy ( lazy ) option every day of winter			0
' @entity151 has long been a fan of the bare leg			0
here she is pictured at the @entity154 fashion show on september 30 in @entity155 model @entity156 shares her sister @entity15 's penchant for a bare leg			1
here she is at the @entity160 of @entity162 film premiere in @entity25 on october 28 @entity163 has some of the longest legs in @entity165 and she likes to show them off			0
here she is in @entity38 on october 30 @entity16 shunned tights at a party in the @entity170 shop in @entity25 last night model @entity171 also wore a naked leg to last night 's @entity170 party , despite temperatures in the capital dropping to as low as five degrees @entity178 also wore a naked leg last night - to the @entity180 @entity1 model @entity181 wore no tights to the @entity170 party , along with a flat ankle boot			1
it is considered one of the hardest naked leg looks to pull off			0
@entity188 skipped the tights to join @entity190 for a private screening of ' @entity192 ' in @entity38 last night			0
