@entity0 says @entity1 is as good as @entity2 , @entity3 and all the other greats of the track			1
the @entity7 chief executive was speaking in his air - conditioned office in the @entity9 before sunday 's @entity10 , squinting through his @entity12 glasses at the state of the sport he has spent his life moulding			1
@entity17 has taken a pounding from the public and pundits since the processional opening race in @entity22 a fortnight ago			1
only 75 per cent of the cars started			2
several teams are on the brink of bankruptcy			0
@entity1 is pictured in the paddock on friday after ending the second session on top of the timesheets @entity0 , 84 , rates @entity1 as the best world champion @entity17 has ever had @entity0 is ‘ disappointed ’ but in @entity34 he sees only positives : a distinctive character who sells the sport by his deeds at the wheel and his celebrity on the red carpet			1
‘ he ’s the best world champion we ’ve had , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ as a driver he is absolutely outstanding — as good as there ’s ever been			2
apart from the talent , he ’s a good guy , he gets out on the street and supports and promotes @entity17			1
he is box office , 100 per cent			1
‘ it does n’t matter what comes out of @entity1 ’s mouth , it ’s good — even if it ’s silly			1
it ’s great for the sport			2
i told @entity58 ( @entity59 ) he should do what @entity1 is doing — put himself out there			1
he won four titles but went to ground			0
‘ he should have done the job of world champion			0
he got paid money for being champion			0
these guys think their only job is racing a car			0
it goes a bit further than that			0
the @entity75 , relaxing in the @entity74 garage , is bidding to win his second consecutive championship @entity1 has helped boost the profile of @entity17 , seen here with @entity79 and @entity80 ‘ most do n’t think about a life beyond @entity17			1
@entity82 is still making quite a bit of money and he has n’t been in a car for a few years			0
’ @entity0 , 84 , is criticised for selling the sport ’s soul to ever higher bidders , with @entity89 in @entity90 due to be added to the calendar next year and the @entity92 @entity10 off for this season , with no guarantee of a return			1
@entity0 said that even @entity96 , the track central to @entity99 ’s love affair with motor racing , could be another victim			2
‘ it would be terrible , but if it goes , it goes , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s funny how these people dig up money for things like the @entity108 , @entity110 athletics and @entity111 knows what else			0
people say we charge too much for a race , and they are probably right , but teams get 62 per cent of the profit the company makes , so if we make less money , the teams make less money			0
’ @entity1 ended the second session in @entity9 leading the way after missing most of the morning @entity1 parades the @entity124 after sealing last year 's championship at the @entity126 @entity0 was speaking after meeting team principals , when he laid out ideas for improvement			1
controversially , he wants to bring back double points , introduced to widespread ridicule for the final round of the 2014 season			1
‘ last year we did n’t know who the world champion was until the last corner of the last race , ’ he said			0
i ’d like to extend it to the last three races			0
’ and then there are the sprinklers to create artificially wet races			0
@entity0 said : ‘ we should do that			2
why not have six races where there ’s something different ? ‘ i also suggested that we give 20 points over a weekend			2
ten points for pole and 10 for winning the race			2
then the one on pole starts maybe 12th on the grid , so you get a bunch of decent guys starting in the middle of the field			0
’ @entity59 , the four - time world champion , speaks to @entity161 team - mate @entity160 on friday @entity59 , on track during the second practice session , for the second round of the championship in @entity166 what chance is there of these innovations being introduced ? first , @entity0 , would need agreement from the teams			1
‘ they need to think about it , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s difficult for them — we ’ve only been talking for five meetings ! ’ there is no way of reining in @entity1 ’s @entity74 team or of spreading the prize - money more evenly			1
@entity0 works for private equity firm @entity182 , criticised for taking out too much profit and investing too little in the future			1
but he explained : ‘ we ’ve got an old house and we keep repairing it			0
it ’s not really the way to go but we ca n’t tear up contracts that have been signed			0
‘ @entity74 have the best engine , the best chassis , the best team , two of the best drivers , so they are entitled to win			2
it ’s not good blaming them			0
’ @entity1 is favourite to seal back - to - back titles with @entity74 yet again boasting the best package that is true — even if it means that @entity200 leave the sport as managing director @entity202 hinted on friday , if ‘ @entity17 is that bad for our reputation ’			1
there are few cares in @entity1 ’s world			2
he was fastest in practice on friday , despite missing the morning session with an engine problem			0
the @entity166 @entity10 — @entity1 ’s 150th — looks sure to be a straight fight between the @entity212 and his team - mate @entity213 , who , it has been emerged , was hampered by a fuel sensor problem when he was beaten into second place in @entity22 .			1

@entity0 described @entity1 as ' 100 per cent box office '
