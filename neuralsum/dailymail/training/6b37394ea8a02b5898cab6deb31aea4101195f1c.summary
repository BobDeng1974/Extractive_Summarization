by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:07 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 19:07 est , 1 january 2014 academics who said @entity7 migrants had made a substantial contribution to the public finances were guilty of ‘ schoolboy errors ’ , it was claimed last night			0
a report by @entity12 and @entity13 , two researchers from @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , was given blanket coverage by the @entity17 when it was published last month , and hailed as proof that immigration has a positive economic impact on @entity21			1
but last night their study was condemned as ‘ fatally flawed ’ by one of the country ’s most senior statisticians			1
the report by @entity12 , left , and @entity13 , right , two researchers from @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , was given blanket coverage by the @entity17 when it was published last month @entity28 , @entity29 at @entity15 , said the study was ‘ obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made ’			1
he added : ‘ if any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but assumption - based calculations , the last word he / she would have used to describe the estimates is “ precise ” – unless exhaustion had affected judgment			0
‘ most of the underlying crude assumptions that the all - embracing approach has been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made			0
’ prof @entity28 and statistician @entity45 point out flaws in the paper ’s findings in new research published by the @entity51 think - tank			0
the independent analysis accuses @entity12 and @entity13 of using questionable methods to process the data , having an ‘ inadequate understanding ’ of the data and ‘ significantly overstating their case ’			1
small changes to the ‘ large assumptions ’ about benefit claims the report was based on could make the positive contribution supposedly made by migrants disappear			1
prof @entity12 was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from @entity68 and other @entity7 nations would come after controls were dropped in 2004			2
in the event , more than one million arrived in almost a decade			0
unclear picture : the government has not revealed estimates about how many @entity75 or @entity76 would arrive in the @entity21 from today onwards @entity51 director @entity77 said : ‘ the @entity15 study ’s claims were held up by many as evidence that immigration from @entity75 and @entity76 is unquestionably a good thing			1
‘ but , as our forensic analysis by two respected statisticians shows , the study ’s methodology was flawed and its findings were highly questionable			2
‘ the authors made schoolboy errors in their handling of statistics which fell short of the professional standards recognised by statisticians			0
' it is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like @entity15 can only see what they want to see			2
‘ yet again the @entity17 has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information			2
it has the resources to double - check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices			0
