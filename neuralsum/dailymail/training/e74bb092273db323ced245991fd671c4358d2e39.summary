many of the 7 million consumers who got insurance under president @entity5 's health care law will see their premiums rise next year unless they switch to another plan , independent analysts said as the government released details friday			1
the @entity11 department released a massive computer file of 2015 premiums one day ahead of the start of open enrollment			1
those numbers will take time to fully analyze			0
late friday , the administration said some @entity20 functions were to be turned off overnight in the transition to sign - up season			0
spokeswoman @entity23 said consumers will be able to start enrolling for 2015 coverage sometime early saturday morning			1
the @entity20 website , where people can buy health insurance , opens for business again on saturday but renewals from 2014 might come with a new kind of sticker shock supporters of @entity33 , that state 's @entity35 exchange , have been on a promotional tour all week to raise awareness among @entity39 and others who missed last year 's first enrollment season premiums are the first thing most consumers look at			1
according to @entity47 's @entity46 , the average premium will be around $ 344 before tax credit subsidies			0
that 's an increase from 2014 of about 3.5 per cent			1
premiums vary from state to state with some down 22 per cent and others up as much as 35 per cent			1
most people who apply through exchanges will qualify for tax credits that reduce their premiums			1
for 2015 , individuals earning between $ 11,670 and $ 46,680 qualify for a premium tax credit			2
for a family of four , the range is $ 23,850 to $ 95,400			0
but there is a catch if you already buy medical insurance through the @entity35 marketplaces : your plan may no longer be the lost - cost benchmark in your community			1
in that case , you 'll pay more unless you switch			1
' just because you enrolled in a low - cost plan this year is no guarantee that your plan will also be low - cost next year , ' said @entity72 of the nonpartisan @entity73			1
he analyzed a 48 - city sample of 2015 premiums from data available earlier this week			1
' last year 's low cost plans will experience premium increases , meaning the majority of consumers will experience cost increases if they re-enroll in the same plan , ' said @entity84 of @entity85 , a private market analysis firm			1
an early look by @entity88 at premiums for a hypothetical 50 - year - old nonsmoker in the benchmark plan found wide differences among states , from a 28 per cent increase in @entity95 to a 19 per cent reduction in @entity97			1
most states saw single - digit changes			0
consumers should be wary of national and even state averages , and instead focus on what 's happening with their own plan , the analysis said			2
the shifts are due to the ups and downs of the market , and to cost - saving provisions written into the law			2
the @entity35 offers subsidized private health insurance to people who do n't have access to coverage on the job			1
@entity20 and state insurance markets are launching their second annual sign - up season , which runs through feb. 15			2
trouble ahead : despite an all - out push by the @entity121 , the @entity35 law remains unpopular with less than 39 per cent of @entity122 saying the support it this year , 85 per cent of their customers received tax credits to subsidize their premiums			1
those existing customers will be renewing coverage for the first time			1
some could face sticker shock			0
the following example uses actual premiums from @entity20 , and was provided by the @entity134 : take a hypothetical 40 - year - old retail salesperson in @entity136 making $ 20,000 a year			1
this year , she signed up for the benchmark low - cost plan in her area , the ' @entity140 $ 10 @entity139			1
' the full premium was $ 270 a month			0
her government tax credit covered $ 184 of that , so her share was $ 86 a month			0
for 2015 , @entity140 is no longer the benchmark plan			1
instead , it 's the ' @entity147 , ' with a monthly premium of $ 274			0
if the consumer switches to @entity151 for 2015 , the government will pay $ 191 and her share will be $ 83			1
but if she wants to stay with @entity140 , she 'll see a 40 per cent increase			0
that 's because @entity140 increased its premium to $ 311 for 2015			0
and also , the federal share will be capped at $ 191 — what the government would pay for the benchmark @entity151 plan			0
the consumer would be on the hook for $ 120 a month			0
part of the reason for such shifts is that the health care law was designed like a voucher system			0
@entity166 , the @entity167 economist regarded as the ' architect ' of the president 's medical insurance overhaul law , is in hot water after a series of videos surfaced in which he suggested that the @entity121 relied on ' the stupidity of the @entity122 voter ' in order to get the law passed in 2010 you get a tax credit for health insurance based on your income and on the premium for the benchmark plan in your area , called the ' second - lowest - cost silver plan			0
' plans are offered in four ' metal levels ' of coverage : bronze , silver , gold and platinum			1
the benchmark silver plan can change every year based on bids submitted by insurers			0
if you pick a higher - cost plan , or if you stay in a plan that has lost its benchmark status , you are responsible for the entire difference in premiums			1
the idea was to create incentives that would force insurers to compete and keep premiums low			1
competition is helping to drive down the price of the benchmarks , said @entity72 , which is good for the federal budget			0
' but competition is also messy , particularly for consumers			0
' some @entity212 saw the predicament as more fodder for their campaign against ' @entity35			1
' ' last year , many who liked their plan were surprised to learn they could n't keep it , ' said @entity220 @entity219 sen. @entity219			0
' this year , many who like their plan will likely have to pay more to keep it			1
' as the federal government and states launch a second round of enrollment under the @entity35 law , plans will cover essential health benefits , pre-existing conditions and preventive care – but dental and vision benefits vary			1
here are some questions and answers about individual coverage : q : how do i choose the right plan ? a : just like last year , there are five categories or metal levels of coverage including bronze , silver , gold , platinum and catastrophic			2
plans in each category pay different amounts of the total costs of an average person 's care			2
for a silver plan , your health plan will pay an average of 70 per cent , you pay about 30 per cent			2
if you expect a lot of doctor visits or need regular prescriptions , you may want a gold or platinum plan that have higher monthly premiums but pay more of your costs when you need care			2
if you do n't expect to use a lot of medical services , you may want a silver , bronze , or catastrophic plan that cost you less per month , but pay less of your costs when you need care			2
catastrophic coverage is available only to people who are under 30 years old or have a hardship exemption			0
q : is vision coverage available ? a : health plans do n't have to include adult vision coverage , only pediatric vision coverage			0
if your plan does n't include adult vision coverage , you can buy stand - alone plans for an additional cost outside the exchange			2
insurers who provide stand - alone vision plans say it 's unfair to keep them out of the exchanges because they are paying millions of dollars in additional taxes to support the health overhaul			2
attempts to address the issue in @entity290 have proved futile , as did a recent attempt in the @entity292			0
@entity293 , the nation 's largest vision care company with 60 million members , had to pay $ 25 million by sept. 30 in new federal taxes even though the company is not allowed to sell directly in most states			0
q : is dental coverage available ? a : health plans do n't have to include adult dental coverage , only pediatric dental coverage			0
if your plan does n't include adult dental , you can buy stand - alone family dental plans for an additional cost through their state exchange			1
some consumers may be drawn to family dental plans if a dentist they prefer is not a provider in their health plan			0
q : i have health insurance through work			0
can i check out the exchange to see if that insurance would be better or cheaper ? a : the exchanges are for people who do n't have access to affordable coverage at work			0
if you lose your job and your health insurance , you can apply for coverage through @entity20 or your state exchange at any time of the year			2
you 'd be eligible for what 's called a ' special enrollment period ' available to people who experience certain life changes			2
coverage through the exchanges is likely to be more affordable than continuing your employer 's plan under @entity340 .			0

existing @entity35 customers may find that the plans they selected last year are no longer the ' low cost benchmarks ' where they live
those people will pay more unless they switch to policies that provide lower benefit levels
open enrollment begins saturday and ends in march 2015
prices are expected to rise by 3.5 per cent overall
premiums vary from state to state with some down 22 per cent and others up as much as 35 per cent .
