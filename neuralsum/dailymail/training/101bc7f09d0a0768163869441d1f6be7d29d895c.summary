health checks will go underway for the @entity2 's freshwater crocodile population in @entity3 ahead of the inevitable arrival of poisonous cane toads to the area			1
the project is run by the @entity8 and plans to get a snapshot by capturing more than 100 crocodiles and examining their health at @entity12			1
district nature conservation coordinator @entity13 told @entity15 that the main aim is to study the toxic cane toads and what effect it has on the crocodile population			1
the picture shows the freshwater crocodiles restrained and calm ready to be processed at @entity22 during the study the @entity25 staff and volunteers restraining the recently caught crocodiles ' by marking it now , we will be able to see the crocodiles growth pattern over the next few years and also take caution of the cane toad population , ' ms @entity13 said			1
' the research will help us get a grasp of the crocodiles population and we can also gather how many males , females , juveniles and exactly where they 're sitting within the parks			0
' as part of their diet , crocodiles consume cane toads but it 's the poisonous glance from the toads that will usually kill the crocodiles			2
' we 've got the @entity49 involved , consultants , volunteers and universities , so we 're really amped to be out here doing such an important work			0
' the @entity55 funded the @entity49 to come out to help us and without them , this research would n't have happened			0
' it 's the first time it 's been done in @entity2			0
' all volunteers , rangers and department staff involved in the intensive survey along the @entity63 with the largest crocodile caught during the survey two departmental employees measuring the length of a crocodile - just one of the many measurements taken @entity8 staff and @entity73 rangers with a @entity74 along the @entity63 after they are captured , researchers will fill out a full page of data on each one , with two people holding it down while a third uses a tape measure to gauge length , width and head size			0
as they are bundled up , their snout , arms and legs will be taped shut and lined up to wait on the shores of the lake for their turn to be examined			0
ms @entity13 said the study is a very safe process and assured that the crocodiles will have less stress levels during the procedure			1
dr @entity99 weighing a freshwater crocodile a freshwater crocodile was recently released back to the pool in @entity103 the @entity55 funded @entity49 with @entity104 and wildlife officer @entity105 chief researcher @entity99 told @entity106 that the @entity22 animals would be used as a test group , to ideally get a few years of cane - toad free data			2
' then we compare the changes in population structure and numbers , to after the cane toads have arrived , ' he said			2
' we are planning on doing this survey a couple of years before the cane toads arrive , and do recaptures afterwards , so we have a much better idea of which fraction of the population is being impacted			2
' @entity106 reports that the @entity121 researchers will also extract a blood sample via a needle inserted into the back of the crocodile 's head to gather genetic data for a seperate research project			0
after the survey is completed , the animals will be returned to their gorge waterway , 300km east of @entity133 .			1

the study will look at toxic cane toads and what effect it has on the freshwater crocodile population in @entity2
