@entity0 has taken to life on the pitch in the @entity3 with ease since he joined @entity5 from @entity6 in the summer			1
but some @entity8 ways have taken the 20 - year - old centre - half by surprise - such as having to set the clocks back every october			2
though he was born in @entity11 , @entity0 moved to @entity12 at the age of eight and remained there until @entity5 paid £ 4m to bring him to @entity14 in august			1
@entity0 has adapted well to life in the @entity3 for @entity5 since his £ 4m summer move @entity0 tries to stop @entity18 's @entity17 during last weekend 's clash at the @entity20 so despite being an @entity21 under 21 international , @entity0 has had a crash course education in @entity8 life over the last few weeks			1
he told @entity24 on sunday : ' i was very young when i went to @entity12 and do n't remember anything about living here previously			1
all i remember from childhood is living in @entity12			2
' living here feels very strange			0
i feel like i am in a new country			0
' i did n't even know the clocks were going back until a secretary at the club told me on thursday			0
she told me that it will get dark here at about 4pm			2
i did n't know that			0
@entity0 had lived in @entity12 since the age of eight and played for @entity6 until the summer @entity0 made the perfect start to life at @entity5 by scoring the late winner at @entity42 on the opening day ' they do n't do that in @entity12			1
i thought she was having me on at first			0
nobody told me that when i signed ! ' it can only be hoped as winter descends that @entity0 finds his way to @entity50 in time for sunday 's 1.30pm kick - off with @entity52			1
but there have been no such problems on the pitch , with @entity0 starting nine matches for @entity5 this season in the @entity3 and the @entity58			1
@entity0 is an @entity21 under 21 international and is expected to play in next summer 's @entity59 he admits @entity21 's top flight is a step up from @entity12 's but is well equipped to cope			1
' teams counter very quickly against us , ' he said			0
' so you have to get used to having long spells of possession and then reacting really quickly when you lose the ball			0
' so you have to be switched on at all times , otherwise you can get caught out			0
' @entity5 have been caught out on a few occasions so far this season but sit 10th in the standings ahead of @entity52 's visit .			2

@entity0 has impressed for @entity5 since joining in the summer
but some elements of @entity8 life have been tricky to adapt to
for example , nobody told him it gets dark at 4pm in the winter
@entity0 was brought up in @entity12 and played for @entity6
