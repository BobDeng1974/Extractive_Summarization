a @entity1 judge threw out a 124 - year prison term handed down a decade ago to an heir to the @entity5 fortune for raping three women and related crimes , ruling on monday that the original sentencing had been improper			1
@entity9 will receive a new sentencing hearing in april but the judge declined to give the 49 - year - old a new trial			1
@entity9 was convicted in 2003 in absentia of 86 counts including rape of an intoxicated person , rape of an unconscious person and sexual battery			1
he fled to @entity20 during the trial			2
also on monday , bounty hunter @entity22 , the man who captured @entity9 in the @entity20 resort city of @entity24 , revealed that he got a vital tip - off about the fugitive 's hiding place from @entity9 's own attorney , the late @entity28			1
new hearing : @entity9 , left , is led out of the @entity31 building at lax by @entity34 agents a day after being captured by @entity35 in @entity20 in june 2003 @entity9 , the great - grandson of cosmetics giant @entity5 , was caught in 2003 by @entity22 , in a development that helped propel @entity22 to fame and his own reality tv show			1
the make - up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing , and @entity42 superior court judge @entity41 ruled on monday that the judge who sent him to prison for 124 years ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' rather than having them run concurrently			2
' the previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing will be held , ' @entity41 wrote in her 28 - page opinion that also denied him a new trial			1
the judge set an april 4 sentencing hearing for @entity9			1
attorneys for the @entity5 heir had argued he deserved one , in part because his original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one lawyer , @entity28 , gave him ill - conceived advice to flee to @entity20			1
bounty hunter and tv star , @entity22 told @entity66 that @entity28 gave him very useful clues as to @entity9 's location			1
reality tv star : @entity35 , pictured , caught @entity9 while he was on the run in 2003			2
last month , he revealed that he was tipped off about @entity9 's location by the fugitives own attorney as @entity66 reports , @entity28 passed away in april 2011			1
the lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client 's hiding place			1
but according to ' dog ' the attorney did give him the information , in a very subtle way			0
' @entity28 became very nice to me , ' @entity22 explained to @entity66			0
' we used to tease each other			0
and at one point he said to me , " i ’m going to tell you something @entity35 , so do n’t be so dumb			0
" and then he said , " the guy ( @entity9 ) speaks @entity88			0
do you get it ? " ' the bounty hunter immediately understood			0
' i had leads that pointed to @entity92 and @entity20 , ' he said			0
' right then i dropped all my leads on @entity92 and focused on @entity20			0
' @entity22 captured @entity9 in june 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in @entity20			2
judge @entity41 ruled last month that the judge who sent @entity9 to prison for 124 years ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' rather than having them run concurrently on monday , @entity41 wrote that @entity9 's attorneys did not fail him at trial , and she rejected his current lawyers ' arguments that @entity9 was manipulated into fleeing			2
' although several witnesses did describe @entity9 as ' childlike , ' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund , and he lived the life of a carefree ' beach bum , ' @entity41 wrote			0
she added that @entity9 , who spent much of his time surfing , described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading , and that he did not appear to have a low iq			0
@entity9 was found guilty of giving three women the date rape drug @entity119 and raping them while they were unconscious or intoxicated			0
video tape @entity9 took of his sexual acts with the women was presented against him at trial .			0

@entity9 , great - grandson of cosmetics giant @entity5 , will get a new sentencing hearing for his 86 counts of rape but no new trial
@entity9 fled @entity131 during original trial before being captured in @entity20 by ' @entity35 '
now ' dog ' *claims* he was told the fugitive 's hiding place by @entity9 's own attorney
