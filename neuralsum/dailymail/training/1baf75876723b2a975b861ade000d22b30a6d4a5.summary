from racism and gay slurs to sexual harassment and x-rated revelations , the current series of celebrity big brother is shaping up to be the most offensive yet			1
now with rumours that @entity10 's love rival - @entity9 , the former best friend who slept with her husband @entity11 - is joining the house , it 's clear the reality show 's bosses are intent on creating a programme that is nothing less than explosive			1
but experts say that no matter how badly the contestants behave viewers keep tuning in because it makes ' us feel better about ourselves '			2
@entity22 accused his in - house tormentor @entity26 of being homophobic after she told him to ' man up			1
' @entity10 has mooned at the camera , talked about sex toys and anal sex and how one partner gave her cystitis			1
she 's blasted her ex-husband @entity44 for his alleged sexual proclivities and referred to another ex , @entity46 , as having a small penis in conversations with her fellow housemates			1
her headline - grabbing stories follow early exits from three other housemates			2
@entity55 actor @entity54 , 71 , famous for playing @entity56 in the soap , made regular mention of the female housemates ' bodies and was eventually removed after he used the word , ' negro , ' twice in reference to soul singer @entity64			1
@entity54 was the first to leave the @entity66 house , he was accused of racism , sexism and misogyny communications watchdog @entity70 said that they had a total of 1,605 complaints in total about the show and 233 about @entity54 's language			1
they have had 708 complaints about the treatment of @entity22 and 90 about former model @entity78 being bullied			2
some of the housemates had called her ' stupid , ' and @entity26 said that if all the world was filled with people like @entity78 it would be a worse place			2
the complaints are currently under assessment and @entity70 have not yet decided whether they will launch any formal investigations			2
@entity78 accused glamour girl @entity31 ( pictured ) of being threatening after she just ' went for her ' in the 2007 series of @entity66 the late @entity87 and her fellow housemates @entity89 and @entity90 were accused of bullying and racially abusing @entity93 yet the housemates ' behaviour degenerated further as after drinking too much , baywatch actor @entity94 went to the toilet to be sick , where @entity99 , wearing a dressing gown , followed him to help			1
he then pulled open her dressing gown to reveal her bare breast			0
@entity94 dismissed the incident as a case of ' curiosity killed the cat ' and was ejected from the show			1
@entity109 , which covers the area where the show is filmed , confirmed at the time that they were investigating the situation , however , @entity99 later decided not to press charges			1
meanwhile , @entity64 , 61 , who had hits in the @entity115 with @entity116 and @entity117 , made the statement : ' i hoped there were no @entity121 in the house , ' despite having claimed to , ' hate ' , racism			1
and a series of furious bust - ups between @entity22 and @entity64 saw the singer walk out claiming he had to remove himself from the house because he was fearful of what he may do - but not before he used an offensive gay slur to describe the @entity131 blogger			1
@entity64 left the house over clashes with @entity22 and he was also accused of racism while celebrity @entity137 producers usually rub their hands with glee at the antics on the show , they can only be dismayed by the degree to which the housemates have insulted each other on the basis of gender , race and orientation			1
experts say the endless rows and clashes are a result of the particular combination of strong personalities this year , as each housemate struggles for dominance			0
behavioral psychologist @entity156 says that part of the reason the stars are acting out so much is because they know it will garner them a huge deal of attention			1
she said : ' the housemates will 100 per cent exaggerate their characters from the outside world			0
nice people simply are not entertaining and they know that			0
' we watch the shows for the fights and that ’s what we remember about them			0
' @entity26 gets up close and personal with @entity174 during a fake tanning session in the outside world @entity26 is known for her acerbic ways and in the house she has been fighting with her fellow housemtes , especially @entity22 she said : ' this series is the first series where there have been a lot of very similar characters , they all have this need to be in control			0
' usually there are only one or two people with those strong characters and then you have the slightly crazier periphery characters			0
' but this year you have @entity22 , @entity26 , @entity192 and @entity174 all competing for top dog spot and they ’re all people who are used to being in control			0
' and the sight of these adults clashing and bickering childishly has a positive effect on the viewers ,			0
@entity10 has shocked both her fellow housemates and audiences alike talking about her ex-boyfriends the two @entity202 and @entity26 - have been determined to shock during their time on the @entity205 show ' watching it makes us feel better about ourselves , we think – i would never do that , i would never behave in that way			1
' plus it 's a show you can watch with all your family , although you think the behaviour can be awful it gives you something to talk about and discuss			1
' and although there may not have been as many official complaints about this series as the 2007 series in which @entity87 and @entity221 bullied @entity93 , this is down to the different ways we vent our anger in the era of social media			0
some 44,500 people complained to @entity70 during celebrity @entity66 5 , but there were more than 24,000 tweets about @entity54 and more than 100,000 about @entity94			1

he said : ' people are no longer looking at just one screen on their sofas at home			0
while watching traditional tv we are on @entity249 , @entity250 and the internet at the same time			0
' outrageous reality tv like @entity240 draws that attention back to the the big screen because people want to share their outrage within a community			1
it 's the digital version of a water cooler			2
' and with hard - line chat - show host @entity260 widely reported to be entering the house we can only imagine that the show is set to get more controversial in the days to come			0
this is n't the first year that all hell has broken loose in the @entity267 house ... 2007 : @entity66 5 was a series that will go down in history			0
