sir @entity0 , chief of @entity1 , said children are not being taught the basic skills needed to survive in the workplace millions of youngsters are too sloppy and slovenly to get jobs because they lack the discipline or skills needed for work , the chief inspector of schools said yesterday			1
school and college leavers are careless about time , lack a work ethic , do not dress or speak well and are lackadaisical , sir @entity0 added in his scathing remarks			1
employers think teenagers and those in their early 20s have never been taught how to behave and work or about the attitude they need to get on , he continued			0
sir @entity0 , head of @entity1 , made his attack as the inspectorate published a highly critical report on the quality of further education and sixth - form teaching for 16 to 19 - year - olds			1
in particular , it savaged @entity31 and maths teaching , and failures in the way young people are guided towards careers			1
the report said there was no point in keeping young people in education until 18 if they did not gain qualifications or were not prepared for the demands of work			1
‘ many employers complain that far too many young people looking for work have not been taught the skills , attitudes and behaviours they need to be successful , ’ sir @entity0 warned			1
‘ it means they have a sloppy attitude to punctuality			0
it means they are far too relaxed in terms of meeting deadlines			0
it means that far too many young people are lackadaisical in the way they present themselves for work			1
‘ if they dress inappropriately , speak inappropriately and have poor social skills , they are not going to get a job			0
‘ youth unemployment is far too high and it is in everyone ’s interest that young people receive the very best education and training to improve this situation			2
’ his verdict came a day after an analysis by the wealthy nations grouping , the @entity73 , said only a quarter of @entity78 graduates scored well in maths and @entity31 tests			1
this was well below standards achieved at universities in rival countries			0
@entity73 officials said in @entity86 , the top - rated country , foundations for good language and maths skills were laid in schools but that is ‘ not true for the @entity78 ’			1
sir @entity0 said at the launch of the @entity1 report : ‘ the gap between the good intentions of policy and the reality of what is happening is worryingly wide			1
‘ too few young people know what they want to do at 18 because the quality of careers guidance is shockingly poor , ’ sir @entity0 went on			1
‘ too few students make sufficient progress in improving their @entity31 and maths because the teaching is simply not good enough			2
‘ again , it is quite shocking that 84 per cent of youngsters who do n’t get the gcse at grade c in @entity31 and maths at 16 fail again at 19			0
’ his remarks reflect the long - standing despair felt by many employers			0
as a result of @entity129 ’s @entity128 , the school leaving age was raised from 16			0
by last year all teenagers had to stay on in education or training to 17			0
next year , they can not leave education or training until aged 18			0
just under 1.18million young people aged 16 to 24 count as @entity137 – not in employment , education or training			2
yesterday ’s report said too few schools and colleges had taken advantage of new ways to fund courses to boost standards			0
‘ too much teaching in @entity31 and maths is not good enough as not enough learners are making sufficient progress in developing their reading , writing , oral communication and mathematical skills , ’ it warned			2
‘ there is a shortage of good teachers of @entity31 and , in particular , mathematics			1
’ a spokesman at the @entity162 responded : ‘ the number of young people @entity163 is at its lowest level since consistent records began			2
‘ we have scrapped thousands of low - quality qualifications so that only the gold - standard , employer - valued courses remain			0
‘ and providers are now incentivised to ensure young people study valuable courses			2

sir @entity0 said careers advice in school was not up to scratch
also attacked schools for not preparing pupils for the world of work
@entity185 maths and @entity31 standards are poor with not enough good teachers
there are currently *767,000* young people out of work in the @entity78
