but drama of a different kind could soon be coming to @entity6 – after mps agreed plans to hire out the houses of @entity10 to @entity12 film studios			1
the move , which would allow action blockbusters and period dramas to be filmed inside for the first time , is designed to help pay for repairs to the increasingly rundown 19th century @entity6			1
@entity18 inside the fake @entity19 in @entity20			1
in future @entity10 will allow filming inside it any refurbishment , which will include removing asbestos , fixing leaky roofs and replacing the 1930s electrical and heating systems , could cost more than £ 1 billion			1
@entity7 reckon that film studios would pay at least £ 10,000 a day to hire the buildings			1
one said last night : ‘ we ’d be mad not to hire the place out to the highest bidder			1
‘ other imposing 19th century buildings make a fortune providing interiors of what is supposed to be inside the @entity34			2
let ’s give them the real thing and save the taxpayer some cash into the bargain			0
’ although tv cameras have been recording commons proceedings for more than a decade , any filming connected to ‘ advertising , fundraising or for commercial purposes ’ is banned			0
a fake @entity19 was built for the filming of @entity49 's @entity48 in 1986 , it was then used for @entity20 @entity20 was filmed in a 5,000 sq ft replica of @entity51 instead of the real thing the @entity53 's circular court was used as a nightclub in the latest installment of @entity56 even dramas supposedly set in @entity6 are filmed elsewhere , with @entity58 doubling as @entity10 ’s neo-gothic corridors and meeting rooms			1
in the 2011 film @entity20 , which saw @entity18 win an @entity62 for her portrayal of @entity64 , the @entity34 chamber was actually a 5,000 sq ft replica			0
earlier this year , the imitation chamber – first used in @entity70 ’s 1986 adaptation of @entity49 ’s @entity48 – was sold on @entity71 for more than £ 123,000			2
plans to allow filming in the @entity19 are designed to help with repairs to the building , including updates to the heating and electricity but last week the @entity78 agreed to allow ‘ appropriate commercial filming ’ on days when the @entity19 is not sitting			1
officials stressed that the final decision will have to be made by speaker @entity82 and the ruling @entity83			0
but one @entity88 said : ‘ each bid for filming would have to be assessed on its merits			0
however , if @entity92 turns up offering us a big cheque , and we ’re not using the building that day , it would be silly to turn it down			0
the money will come in useful for all the repairs			2
’ other @entity97 buildings are already hired out , including the @entity53 ’s circular court , which was recently used as an underground nightclub in @entity100 , the latest in the @entity102 film series			0
the @entity103 , which has spectacular views of the capital , was also used in the @entity107 blockbuster @entity108			0
but last night , one senior @entity109 mp raised doubts over the @entity34 film plan			0
former defence minister sir @entity112 said : ‘ there is an aura and mystique about @entity10 which we must be very careful not to damage			1
we are trustees of one of the most iconic and famous buildings in the world			0
’ he also warned that there would be ‘ security implications ’ over letting commercial film directors inside .			2
