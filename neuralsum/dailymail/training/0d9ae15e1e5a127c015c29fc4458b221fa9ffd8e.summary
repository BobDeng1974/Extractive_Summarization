by @entity0 for a couple from @entity2 , exit 52 on @entity4 will always be special after giving birth to a baby daughter at the roadside			1
@entity8 and her husband @entity9 from @entity10 , near @entity11 , were on their way to the hospital to allow @entity15 to give birth when all of a sudden she started having contractions			1
' i had one at eight minutes and that one hurt and i said let`s go and we called his mom and got in the car			0
by the time we made it to the interstate they were within three minutes , ' said @entity8 to @entity28			0
teamwork : @entity8 and her husband @entity9 were en route to the hospital overnight to deliver their baby when things took an unexpected turn coming - ready or not ! it does n't quite have the same facilities as @entity39 , but it 's where their child was born it was to be the couples ' third child so both of them knew what to expect - the problem was , they were 30 miles away from the nearest hospital			1
' i had another contraction and i said ‘ her heads out , we`re not going to make it there , ’ ' said @entity8			0
her husband called 911 and pulled over on exit 52 in @entity57 , just south of @entity11			2
the operator ended up telling him to deliver his own child while telling his wife to remain calm			1
welcome to the world ! @entity62 was born just after midnight , weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces			1
she was named after her unique arrival relaxed : the couple are able to smile and laugh about it now , but their daughter came when they least expected her to he ran around to her side of the car and got into the back seat in order to deliver the child			1
' she told us step by step what to do and i just followed her lead , ' said @entity9			2
' he came running around and he said you`re going to have to push for me so i pushed once and there she was , ' said @entity8			0
@entity9 performed the delivery superbly and even had to deal with the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby 's neck			2
exit 52 : it means so many things , to many people , especially those living in @entity91 or @entity92 race : the couple still had 30 miles to drive to reach @entity95 in @entity11 when @entity97 s water broke she also had trouble breathing so he had to rub her on her back in order to make her cry			0
@entity103 was born just after midnight , weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces			0
she was named after her unique arrival			0
' we decided that just by the @entity107 she was safe and healthy so thought it was kind of fitting , ' said @entity8			0
unusual : it 's not your usual delivery room unaware : both mother and baby are doing well and dad says he ¿ ll never look at exit 52 the same again recalling : @entity9 says there were some anxious moments when little @entity62 was n't breathing and the umblicial cord was wrapped around her neck			1

@entity15 and @entity9 from @entity2 were heading to hospital to give birth
@entity62 could n't wait to arrive and so @entity15 had to deliver at the roadside
@entity9 was given *instructions* by the 911 operator as to how to bring the child into the world
