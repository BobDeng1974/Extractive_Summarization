@entity1 almost took a seventh wife but gave up on his final @entity4 love because she was too feisty , outspoken and had a habit of nagging him , it emerged today			1
the monarch considered divorcing his sixth bride @entity8 to walk down the aisle with duchess @entity10 , a new book claims			1
she had already given birth to two sons and @entity1 was so obsessed with producing male heirs that he believed she could help continue the @entity16 dynasty			2
the pair met in the 1530s and flirted at court , danced together and even exchanged gifts around @entity21			1
but @entity1 was ' jaded ' after six failed marriages , two of which he ended with executions , and finally put off another divorce because she was too domineering , according to her biographer			1

she was also known to lecture people on @entity36 , including the king , who made himself the head of the church after breaking from @entity40 in 1534			0
author of @entity1 's @entity42 , @entity43 , claims despite @entity1 's love of strong women he had learned his lesson and finally decided to stick with the wife he had			1
he said : ' it was apparent that @entity1 was very fond of @entity10			1
' @entity1 was obviously keen on her , and what wanted @entity1 wanted , he usually got			2
he liked her feistiness as one of his subjects , but as a wife - that might have been a different matter			0
' she could 've become his seventh wife but he may have just been getting a bit tired of the whole business			1
it would n't be surprising if he was jaded by the experience of his six wives			2
' he says @entity10 , @entity30 of @entity63 , first caught the @entity65 's eye when she was married to the @entity63			1
the monarch went on to marry @entity67 , @entity68 and then the devout @entity69 @entity8 in rapid succession between 1540 to 1543			2
@entity10 waited on both @entity67 and @entity68 before joining @entity8 's household - and was regularly at court			1
at one point they exchanged @entity75 gifts			0
@entity76 also sought to gain favour with @entity78 - the king 's chief schemer and main character in @entity82 's @entity81 - but the marriage never happened			2
' jaded ' : @entity1 , played by @entity84 in @entity81 , had been worn down by a series of disastrous marriages , including to @entity87 , played by @entity88 , who he eventually had executed @entity90 : @entity76 sought to gain favour with @entity1 's closest aide @entity78 , played by @entity92 , and wrote to him regularly but the marriage to the king never happened expert : author @entity43 says the king ' liked her feistiness ' but ' as a wife - that might have been a different matter ' mr @entity43 said : ' rumours are sometimes without foundation , but there are strong indications that @entity105 found @entity10 attractive			1
' they had been exchanging @entity75 gifts since 1534 , and he had been " masking and visiting " with her in march 1538 , only months after @entity110 's death			2
' it is possible he saw this younger , perhaps more attractive , woman who was now a widow and the mother of two healthy boys as the solution to his problem			0
' he would not have been the first man to think that a new , more exciting , relationship would somehow restore his lost youth			0
' @entity10 was known for being outspoken - and liked offending people in front of other members of aristocratic society			2
she once dressed her dog in a white religious vestments and named it after a @entity128 bishop , @entity34 , whom she particularly disliked			0
mr @entity43 said she was known as a ' virago ' - a domineering woman - and her ' feistiness ' and ' sharp tongue ' made @entity1 fearful of another disastrous marriage			0

' the reality is that he would have found @entity10 's forceful @entity69 as disconcerting as @entity8 's if he had allowed her to take @entity134 's position , and it made no sense to exchange one virago for another			1
' he did n't like being lectured by his wife on matters of religion as if she knew more than he did			0
' @entity8 and @entity10 were both equally staunch @entity69 and equally feisty ladies			1
' if he was n't getting much joy from @entity8 , he probably would n't have been any better off with the other			0
' their marriage was not to be and @entity10 later fled @entity165 in exile when @entity167 came to the throne			0
