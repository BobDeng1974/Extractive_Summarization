cover - up : former head of news @entity2 said the 2006 seminar affected a ' broad range of output ' , but that its attendees should be kept from the public the @entity9 has spent tens of thousands of pounds over six years trying to keep secret an extraordinary ‘ eco ’ conference which has shaped its coverage of global warming , @entity13 can reveal			1
the controversial seminar was run by a body set up by the @entity9 ’s own environment analyst @entity17 and funded via a £ 67,000 grant from the then @entity20 government , which hoped to see its ‘ line ’ on climate change and other @entity24 issues promoted in @entity9 reporting			1
at the event , in 2006 , green activists and scientists – one of whom believes climate change is a bigger danger than global nuclear war – lectured 28 of the @entity34 ’s most senior executives			1
then director of television @entity35 opened the seminar by telling the executives to ask themselves : ‘ how do you plan and run a city that is going to be submerged ? ’ and she asked them to consider if climate change laboratories might offer material for a thriller			2
a lobby group with close links to green campaigners , the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , helped to arrange government funding for both the climate seminar and other @entity9 seminars run by mr @entity17 – one of which was attended by then @entity20 cabinet minister @entity55			1
applying for money from mr @entity58 ’s @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , the @entity46 promised ministers the seminars would influence programme content for years to come			2
the @entity9 began its long legal battle to keep details of the conference secret after an amateur climate blogger spotted a passing reference to it in an official report			1
@entity68 , 69 , from @entity69 , asked for further disclosure under the @entity71			2
the @entity9 ’s resistance to revealing anything about its funding and the names of those present led to a protracted struggle in the @entity77			1
the @entity9 has admitted it has spent more than £ 20,000 on barristers ’ fees			1
however , the full cost of their legal battle is understood to be much higher			2
in a written statement opposing disclosure in 2012 , former @entity9 news chief and current director of @entity9 radio @entity2 , who attended the event , admitted : ‘ in my view , the seminar had an impact on a broad range of @entity9 output			1
’ plea : part of @entity2 's statement opposing disclosure in 2012			1
she also said the seminar had sought to ' identify where the main areas of debate lie '			0
she is now the director of @entity9 radio she said this included news reports by mr @entity17 , and a three - part @entity9 2 series presented by geologist @entity104 , who told viewers global warming was ‘ truly scary ’			1
according to ms @entity2 , ‘ editors and executives who attended were inspired to be more ambitious and creative in their editorial coverage of this slow - moving and complex issue			1
’ she claimed the seminar sought to ‘ identify where the main areas of debate lie ’			0
however , there were no expert climate sceptics present			0
in an internal report , the @entity46 boasted that the seminars organised with mr @entity17 had had ‘ a significant impact on the @entity9 ’s output ’			1
blogger : @entity68 , who went to an information tribunal , said the seminar was ' propaganda ' mr @entity68 , who finally won his battle last month , said : ‘ it is very disappointing that the @entity9 tried so hard to cover this up			1
it seems clear that this seminar was a means of exposing executives to green propaganda			1
’ the freshly disclosed documents show that a number of @entity9 attendees still occupy senior roles at @entity34			1
all four scientists present were strong advocates of the dangers posed by global warming			0
they were led by lord may , former president of the @entity141 , who , though not a climate expert , has argued that warming is a greater threat than nuclear war			0
other non-bbc staff who attended included @entity147 , head of campaigns at @entity149 , @entity150 from the powerful green lobby group @entity151 , @entity152 of the @entity153 , who argued there were only 100 months left to save the planet through radical emissions cuts , and @entity159 of @entity158			1
the @entity9 contingent included future director - general @entity161 , @entity162 , head of tv news , @entity164 , head of radio news , @entity167 , head of newsgathering , and @entity170 , editor of @entity173 ’s pm			1
mr @entity17 was the seminar ’s principal organiser			0
he ran it through the @entity176 , an outfit he set up with @entity179 lecturer @entity178			0
mr @entity17 and mr @entity178 did not derive personal financial benefit from the seminar			0
but by teaming up with the @entity46 , an avowed lobby group trying to influence coverage , and accepting government funds when @entity20 was advocating radical policies to combat global warming , mr @entity17 exposed himself to the charge he could be compromising the @entity34 ’s impartiality			2
during the legal battle , the @entity9 tried to airbrush both the @entity46 and its approach to the government for funding from the record			1
submissions and witness statements made no mention of it			0
influence : the seminar was led by lord may ( left ) , the former president of the @entity141 who has said climate change is worse than nuclear war , and attendees included former chief @entity161 ( right ) mr @entity17 formed a partnership with the @entity46 in 2004			2
according to the newly - disclosed funding application to @entity57 , drawn up by @entity46 director @entity206 , it helped organise two @entity9 seminars on @entity24 themes with mr @entity17 that year			1
these , mr @entity206 wrote , ‘ had clearly influenced editorial staff and resulted in several new commissions ’			0
@entity57 ’s budget is supposed to be devoted to overseas aid projects			0
but mr @entity206 asked for £ 115,305 for the two years from march 2005 , adding : ‘ we have a firm commitment from the @entity9 to take part in seminars in 2005 and 2006 and to give all the support they can to this project			1
’ the @entity57 did not meet the @entity46 ’s full bid			0
but the documents show it paid £ 67,404 over two years			2
a @entity9 spokesman said yesterday the seminar had ‘ no agenda ’ , and that the organisers recognised @entity9 rules on impartiality , while the @entity46 ’s funding application was a ‘ matter for them ’			1
comment by @entity232 last week was a big one for weather news : the storms and floods in @entity236 , and the end of the bizarre saga which saw the @entity239 , the ship carrying climate scientists , tourists and a @entity9 reporter to inspect the ravages of global warming , trapped in @entity247 ice			1
in both cases , the @entity9 stuck closely to its skewed , climate alarmist agenda			2
@entity251 fuelled suggestions that the storms might be due to climate change by saying in the commons he had ‘ suspicions ’ they were			0
the @entity257 denied this was the case			0
swamped : flooding on the @entity259 last week			0
@entity260 said the @entity9 followed an agenda but repeatedly , the @entity9 followed the pm ’s line			2
slots on the radio 4 today programme and @entity266 repeated the bogus proposition on three separate days – and in none were sceptics allowed to present an alternative view			0
yet the facts are clear			0
@entity257 records show that december 2013 was only the 20th wettest since 1910			0
it had just two - thirds the rainfall of the wettest , 1914			2
for october to december , 2013 was only the 14th wettest year , and there has been no discernible trend in @entity236 or @entity279 rainfall for more than 100 years			0
but though the @entity9 was suggesting the storms were ‘ climate ’ rather than ‘ weather ’ , it took a contradictory view over the icebound ship			2
@entity173 ’s @entity286 told listeners that the ice was a freak , unpredictable event – driven by weather , not climate – and even added it had been falsely ‘ used by climate deniers ’ to advance their case			0
rescue : the crew of the trapped @entity298 vessel @entity299 were airlifted from the @entity247 nevertheless , it allowed an interviewee to state without challenge that overall , @entity247 sea ice is only one per cent above average			0
in fact , it is at record levels , 15 per cent ( 3.5 million square miles ) above normal , and has been increasing for years – a trend the @entity309 @entity310 admits it can not explain .			0

*pensioner* forces @entity9 to lift veil on 2006 *eco-seminar* to top executives
papers reveal influence of top green campaigners including @entity149
then - head of news @entity2 said it impacted a ' broad range of output '
yet @entity9 has spent more than £ 20,000 in legal fees trying to keep it secret
