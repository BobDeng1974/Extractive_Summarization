by @entity0 for the @entity1 the validity of next year ’s general election is being called into question if the @entity5 vote for independence			1
currently , voters north of the border are expected to be able to take part next may , meaning @entity10 could win a majority thanks to its dominance of @entity5 constituencies			1
in may 2010 @entity10 won 41 seats in @entity5 , the @entity15 11 , the @entity16 six while the @entity17 secured just one mp			0
one minister said : ‘ @entity10 could win a majority in 2015 but it would be running a zombie government which everyone knows would lose that majority less than a year later			2
what would happen then ? nobody seems to be thinking about these questions			0
’ some mps now suggest they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote			1
former @entity10 mp @entity43 , now an independent , said the election would ‘ surely be cancelled ’ it would be the first time since 1940 , a year into the second world war , that a general election would have been postponed			1
former @entity10 mp @entity43 , now an independent , said the election would ‘ surely be cancelled ’ , adding : ‘ an @entity49 parliamentary election would be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border			2
‘ there could meanwhile be no question that , for example , @entity10 might win a @entity57 election by a small majority , only to see a @entity60 government and prime minister take power in @entity49 without an election once the @entity5 had departed			2
' moreover , the notion of @entity5 mps voting on @entity49 - only matters while the whole parliament was consumed by @entity5 extracting themselves from the union would be nonsensical and unmanageable			0
’ @entity68 , @entity16 leader at @entity69 , called last year for a delay in the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place			0
but the @entity76 constitution select committee raised doubts about a delay , saying : ‘ the extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may risk being seen by voters as self - serving , extending the time in power of the current government			0

the validity of next year *'s* general election is being called into question if @entity5 votes for independence
currently , voters north of the border are expected to be able to take part next may , meaning @entity10 could win a majority
but all @entity5 mps would be swept away in march 2016 if it goes independent
some mps now suggest they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote
