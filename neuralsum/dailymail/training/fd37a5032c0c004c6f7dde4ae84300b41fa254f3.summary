@entity1 's first appearance for @entity2 since sinking his teeth into the shoulder of @entity6 's @entity5 saw the @entity7 forward produce a beautifully - controlled volley that created the opening goal - and leave the pitch to visit the toilet during the game			1
the 27 - year - old was named in the starting xi for the friendly fixture after his ban for four months and nine international matches was restricted to ' official matches only ' by the @entity19 on appeal			1
and @entity2 's no 9 set about proving why he should be given another chance by striking a right - footed volley that hit the post and forced an own goal from @entity27 , before @entity28 substitute @entity21 equalised in the dying minutes			1
after the match , he said : ' @entity111 to wear this shirt again which gives me so much joy			0
you never lose your love for the shirt			0
@entity2 ! ' it took until the second half for @entity1 to muster the chance for @entity2 in @entity121 , but it was single - handedly created by the controversial Â£ 75million striker			1
@entity1 won the initial free - kick after a rash challenge by @entity31 near the half - way line before peeling away from defenders to meet the resulting cross			0
he hit the left post as goalkeeper @entity130 remained rooted , and defender @entity47 could do little to prevent the ball ricocheting off him into the back of his own net			0
@entity1 could and should have doubled @entity2 's lead in the 66th minute , too			1
latching on to a poor back pass , he found himself one - on - one with @entity55 , but the @entity28 goalkeeper did well to get a palm to the ball as @entity1 sluggishly tried to go around			1
@entity1 , looking disgusted with himself for squandering the opportunity , was substituted for @entity141 's @entity94 shortly afterwards by manager @entity142 with 20 minutes remaining			2
@entity1 could and should have doubled @entity2 's lead in the 66th minute but got plenty of game time @entity1 is getting closer to making his competitive @entity7 debut with @entity146 on october 25 looming @entity1 was unable to double @entity2 's lead in the second half and get his own name on the scoresheet @entity1 left the pitch midway through the match after asking for the referee 's permission to visit the toilet @entity1 's heat map in @entity158 's @entity157 shows he got himself about in certain areas on friday night @entity2 had @entity81 to thank for keeping their lead intact			1
the goalkeeper repeatedly denied @entity28 but it did little good in the dying moments when a glancing header from @entity21 brought the teams level in the 90th minute			2
@entity142 , previously asked to justify selecting @entity1 for the friendly , told reporters last friday : ' i will only speak with @entity1 about my thoughts			0
' you must be humble and not judge			0
i know people have an opinion about it , but judging does n't amuse me			0
' but @entity1 's efforts will please his new owners at the @entity177 with his potential return to competitive football looming when @entity146 verse @entity7 on october 25			2
in a bizarre twist of fate , @entity5 scored both goals for @entity6 as they beat @entity183 2 - 1 in their @entity185 qualifier on friday			2
the defender also found the wrong net to complete his hat - trick			0
@entity1 asks the referee 's permission before heading for the tunnel during the @entity28 vs @entity2 game @entity7 's new forward @entity1 leaves the pitch as play continues between @entity28 and @entity2 @entity1 heads down the tunnel to pop to the toilet during the match after asking the referee if he could leave @entity1 trains with his @entity2 team - mates ahead of the match against @entity28 it was @entity1 's first international match since biting @entity6 's @entity5 during the @entity203			1

@entity1 starts for @entity2 against @entity28 in friendly after @entity19 restricted striker 's ban to ' official matches only '
the @entity7 forward forces a @entity27 own goal to break deadlock with a right - footed volley that hits post and ricochets off defender
@entity1 runs down tunnel and leaves pitch during the game after asking the referee if he can go to the toilet before being substituted on 70 minutes
@entity21 equalises in the final minute as @entity28 secure 1 - 1 draw
