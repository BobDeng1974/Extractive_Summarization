saving lives or playing @entity1 ? by replacing @entity3 with a donor 's , the technique can remove hereditary diseases			1
but detractors say it may lead to ' designer babies ' the first baby with three parents could be born as early as 2015 after a landmark decision to move ahead on a controversial genetic treatment			1
@entity13 could become the first country to sanction the creation of babies with three genetic parents , despite fears it might lead to ‘ designer babies ’			1
the government will publish draft regulations later this year that will bring techniques a step closer to giving women affected by devastating hereditary diseases the chance to have healthy children			1
the techniques involve replacing defective @entity3 in the mother ’s egg with material from a donor egg			1
the resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father			2
for the first time the ‘ germ line ’ of inherited dna from the mother would be altered which , critics say , marks a turning point in the ethics of test - tube babies			1
but the government ’s chief medical officer , professor dame @entity45 , said the alteration did not affect fundamental dna that determines an individual ’s make - up such as facial features and eye colour			1
she compared the new techniques to replacing a defective ‘ battery pack ’ in a cell that would virtually eliminate the chance of a severe disease in the child			1
she said : ‘ scientists have developed ground - breaking new procedures which could stop these diseases being passed on , bringing hope to many families seeking to prevent their future children inheriting them			2
‘ it ’s only right that we look to introduce this life - saving treatment as soon as we can			2
‘ what we ’re going to do now is start to develop the regulations , to consult on the regulations , and then to take them into @entity72			0
’ if mps approve the regulations at the end of next year , the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015			0
stock picture it is expected that between five and ten healthy babies with three parents could be born each year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and often dying prematurely			2
in these cases , a healthy child would inherit the parents ’ nuclear dna , along with mitochondrial dna from a donor			1
@entity93 denied the @entity13 was leading the way to designer babies			1
she said there was a ban on changing nuclear dna which ‘ i do n’t see changing in the foreseeable future ’			2
she said : ‘ i do think quite carefully about ethics , i always did as a clinician and i still do , perhaps because my father was a theologian			0
' i am comfortable with this			0
i think we will save some five to ten babies from being born with ghastly disease and early death without changing what they look like , or how they behave , and it will help mothers to have their own babies			2
’ if mps approve the regulations at the end of next year , the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015 one in 6,500 babies is born seriously affected by a mitochondrial disorder which can lead to hearing and vision loss , heart , lung and liver problems , and bowel disorders			1
an estimated 12,000 people in the @entity13 live with the diseases			0
the move to consult on regulations which would legalise the technique comes after a consultation requested by the government and run by the fertility regulator , the @entity135 ( @entity135 ) , which found there was ‘ general support ’ from the public			0
many experts in the field support the techniques being actively developed at a new laboratory in @entity143 funded by the @entity144 , as well as in the @entity145			0
draft regulations which would permit licensed @entity148 clinics to offer the treatments to women with a family history of severe mitochondrial disease will be published later this year			0
@entity155 , from the group comment on @entity154 , said the proposals were already causing worldwide concern			0
she said : ‘ this controversial announcement – presented simply as innovative genetic treatment when it is in effect an endorsement of highly contentious germ line modification of the human embryo – is hardly unexpected , given the enthusiasm already shown by both the @entity164 ( on @entity165 ) and the @entity135			0
‘ our focus now turns to @entity72 , where we hope that the proposals to create three - parent embryos will be voted down			0
’ dr @entity170 , director of @entity171 , added : ‘ these techniques are unnecessary and unsafe			0

process involves replacing defective @entity3 with material from a donor egg
critics say it is first step to creating ' designer babies '
but @entity134 medical officer says ' fundamental dna ' will not be affected
