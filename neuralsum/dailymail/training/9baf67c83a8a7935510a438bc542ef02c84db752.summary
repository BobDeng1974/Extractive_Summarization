instead of wearing an old ripped shirt and a bit of fake blood this @entity4 , @entity0 decided to wear a classier breed of costume			1
so the @entity8 , @entity9 , resident painstakingly recreated @entity10 itself for this year 's fright-fest and documented the whole process on his website			1
starting with foam board , @entity15 covered it in printed photos of @entity19 , the 5,000 - acre , @entity21 - style country house estate , situated in @entity22 - the setting for all five series of the popular @entity26 period drama			1
elegant couture : @entity0 painstakingly recreated @entity10 itself for his @entity4 costume what would @entity30 make of it ? he covered foam board in printed photos of @entity19 , the 5,000 - acre , @entity21 - style country house estate , situated in @entity22 once he had an entire wall printed and cut , he used spray glue to stick the printouts in place			1
the centre tower was big enough for mr @entity43 's head , but not his arms			0
so , he cut out arch - shaped holes on the sides and , after the printouts were glued to the boards , all the sixteen sides of four corner towers parts - complete with quarter - inch foam brackets - started to come together			2
@entity53 says : ' each of the exterior walls was almost four feet across , so i had to figure out a way to get this costume into a vehicle and through doorways			2
the answer was to assemble the costume with hinges at each corner			0
this would allow the costume to fold into a long diamond shape			0
' once he had an entire wall printed and cut , mr @entity43 used spray glue to stick the printouts in place innovative design : he assembled the costume with hinges at each corner , so he could get through doorways and into a car @entity77 : last year mr @entity43 recreated the entirety of @entity79 for his @entity4 costume previous effort : one year mr @entity43 enjoyed @entity4 as a tornado he added : ' i considered a few different hinge designs , but settled on a length of corrugated plastic , slit down one side			1
this material is ideal for hot gluing , and it is super-strong			0
' i looked around after the hinges were in place and realized i was finished ! somehow i convinced my kids to resist vaulting the castle walls			0
' i straightened the top spikes , added a couple of pvc pipe cross-braces and i was done ! the @entity10 costume was ready to wear !			0
