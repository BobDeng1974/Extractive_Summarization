by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 27 february 2013 @entity1 , from @entity2 in @entity3 , is now calling for a public inquiry into the treatment and wants to raise awareness of the dangers to young women			1
@entity9 is one of the registered trade names for sodium valporate , an anti-epilepsy drug also prescribed to people suffering from bipolar disorders and depression - but there is a risk of birth defects if taken by pregnant women			1
campaigner : @entity1 with @entity22 ( 8 ) , @entity26 ( 3 ) , @entity25 ( 9 ) , @entity23 ( 5 ) and @entity24 ( 7 )			1
she says all her children have experienced problems as a result of her taking @entity9 mrs @entity1 , 32 , who was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 12 , has five children aged three to nine with her husband @entity33 , 40			1
their children - @entity25 , nine , @entity22 , eight , @entity24 , seven , @entity23 , five and @entity35 , three - all have physical and development problems including autism , deafness , cerebral palsy and incontinence			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' it is incredibly difficult as my children each have individual needs and dealing with children on the autistic spectrum is particularly challenging			1
my husband and i have a good routine and we 're managing but it has put a lot of pressure on us as a couple			0
' but she added : ' i want to know why i was never told of the risks when i was pregnant			1
' throughout my pregnancies , i was never warned of the possible side - effects			1
questions were asked about how i was getting on with my epilepsy , but at no point throughout consultations was i advised about the possible side - effects of taking @entity9 on the babies growing in my womb			1
' i was told to continue taking it			2
gps , midwives and consultants all advised me to do so			0
i had complete trust in the medical profession			0
' mrs @entity1 said she began to have doubts after all her children developed health problems			1
mrs @entity1 said doctors did not tell her about the risks of taking @entity9 during her pregnancies she said : ' comments were always made about their features - their eyes and noses ... what i know now as facial dysmorphic features - a symptom of @entity83 ( @entity84 )			1
' developmentally , they were always late in reaching milestones , particularly when it came to speech			0
' during this time i was diagnosed with depression and whenever i brought up the fact something did n't seem right , it was a case of ' @entity1 you have depression , there 's nothing wrong '			1
' i was made to feel i was a neurotic mum imagining things			0
when i raised my concerns , i was given the brush - off			2
' she went on : ' when i discovered the link with @entity9 and birth defects , i actually felt relief - i was n't going mad after all			1
' relief mixed with sadness and devastation that had i not taken the drug the outcome could have been so different			2
' @entity9 is one of the most effective drugs to control epileptic seizures			1
however , researchers at @entity114 published a study this month which found that children exposed to @entity9 in the womb were six times more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders			1
the researchers concluded that one in three of the children born to mothers taking @entity9 has learning difficulties , low iq and types of autism			1
‘ it is a huge medical dilemma , ’ said professor @entity127 , an eminent neuropsychologist who conducted the research			0
a spokeswoman for @entity131 , the pharmaceutical company that manufactures @entity9 , said : ' for some women of child - bearing potential , valporate may be the only effective seizure - control medication			1
' however , a decision to use valporate in such women should only be taken after a very careful evaluation between the patient and her treating physician if the benefits of its use outweigh the risks to the unborn child			2
' because of the well - known risk of birth defects , valporate has not been recommended as a first - choice agent for women with epilepsy who are of child - bearing potential			2
as recommended by the manufacturer , women of child - bearing potential should be informed of the risks and benefits of the use of valporate during pregnancy			1
' it is important to stress that stopping any anti-epileptic medication suddenly can lead to a recurrence of seizures which may be fatal			0
' heartache : @entity167 and daughter @entity168			0
' i am losing my little girl			0
it could happen any day and every moment is precious , ' said @entity167 however , mrs @entity1 said that awareness in the medical profession about the side - effects of @entity9 is still worryingly absent			1
' most clinicians do n't seem to know about @entity83 syndrome and to this day women are unaware of the potential side - effects @entity9 could have on their babies			1
we urge the government to hold a public inquiry into this matter			0
' mrs @entity1 founded the @entity185 ( @entity186 ) , to raise awareness of the condition			1
campaigners estimate that 48,000 children have been born to mothers in the @entity192 who have taken the drug since it was introduced in 1973			2
of these 40 per cent - a massive 19,200 - have developed physical or mental problems			1
@entity167 's 14 - year - old daughter @entity168 suffers from both			2
yesterday , @entity197 reported in the @entity198 that @entity168 is expected to die in a matter of weeks and her family have signed an instruction that she must not be resuscitated			0
she has not been able to swallow solid food for months and can only be fed from a baby ’s bottle			0
her brain is so damaged she has the comprehension of a toddler and has never uttered a word			0
her twisted legs are shrunken and her back is bent			0
she sometimes stops breathing for a minute at a time			0
in march 1998 @entity167 took @entity9 to combat her epileptic fits during the pregnancy			2
her daughter has needed 24 - hour care every day since			2
researchers found that one in three of the children born to mothers taking @entity9 has learning difficulties , low iq and types of autism earlier this month , the @entity198 printed @entity224 ’s heartbreaking account of her battle to get help for her three - year - old granddaughter @entity227 , born brain - damaged after @entity224 ’s daughter took @entity9 when pregnant			1
the cases have huge social implications , says dr @entity231 , a consultant geneticist at the @entity232 and @entity233 who has advised mothers with children damaged by @entity9			1
‘ it is really tough on the families who devote their whole lives to these children , some of whom never really grow up			2
' the parents are worried what will happen when they , themselves , die			0
‘ it is a big financial burden for the country to care for them , and we know that hundreds more babies with the same neurodevelopment problems are being born each year			0
’ six years ago , the law firm @entity250 began a claim for compensation against @entity131 , the drug ’s manufacturer , on behalf of 100 children whose mothers say suffered birth defects because the drug was taken during pregnancy			2
the case was publicly funded by legal aid through the @entity261 ( @entity261 )			0
but in november 2010 , six weeks before the trial was due to start , the @entity261 withdrew funding			0
‘ the @entity261 can only spend taxpayers ’ money where we believe there is a reasonable prospect of success , ’ it said			0
at the time , @entity131 expressed sympathy with the families but insisted it always issued appropriate warnings in its literature on @entity9 ‘ in line with developing scientific knowledge ’			2
under the deal struck when the court case failed , the families promised not to sue @entity131 in the future , if their £ 3.5 million legal costs for preparing the trial were paid for by the pharmaceutical company			0
today @entity167 is still angry about the outcome			0
‘ i took @entity168 , in her wheelchair , to court so the drug company lawyers could see her , ' she said			0
' they would n’t even look us in the eye , and is it any wonder ? ’			0

@entity1 , 32 , has taken the *anti-seizure* drug @entity9 since she was 12
she says doctors never told her of the risks when she was pregnant
