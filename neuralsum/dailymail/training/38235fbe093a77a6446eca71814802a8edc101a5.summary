@entity1 boss @entity0 believes ' a gulf in class ' makes it almost impossible for this season 's relegation battlers to compete with the top sides in the @entity8			1
@entity9 secured a well - deserved 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity12 last month but have failed to earn another point against teams currently in the top half of the table			1
the three promoted sides all find themselves in the relegation zone ahead of this weekend 's fixtures , with @entity1 sandwiched between @entity20 , who are bottom , and @entity22			1
@entity0 bemoaned the ' gulf in class ' that separates his @entity1 side from the top teams in the league @entity27 ( centre ) trains with @entity9 teammates ahead of crucial tie with @entity22 on saturday @entity0 ( left ) will hope @entity31 can add to the seven goals he has scored this season this weekend ' @entity20 beat @entity35 in september and you thought they would finish in the top half , that 's how it goes in this division , it is so hard to win games , there 's a gulf in class , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity12 have beaten @entity44 4 - 1 and @entity45 3 - 0 ( in the last week ) - they 're on another level , they can go away with 10 men and win 3 - 0			0
' that tells you the difference in quality between @entity12 , @entity53 , even @entity54 - they 've got massive budgets and top players			2
' it is hard for clubs like @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity1			2
' eight players that played for us against @entity62 on tuesday played in the @entity63 last year and came up through the play - offs			0
' thirteen points separated sixth place from eighth at the end of last season but the likes of @entity71 , @entity62 and @entity45 are all threatening to upset the established elite			0
@entity0 believes the bottom half will remain tight throughout the campaign but expects the usual suspects to fill the top spots come may			1
' at the start of the year you can predict those challenging for the @entity80 and i think it will still be four from the seven we expected to be there , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 ( left ) looks glum while in discussion with former @entity87 manager @entity86 @entity88 ( centre ) stretches out at @entity1 's @entity91 training ground ahead of their game against @entity22 ' there 's not much in it at the bottom , if you look at the teams - @entity22 are very much the same team that came up last year and we 're the same			1
' @entity20 were definitely the best team in the @entity63 last year and they 're down with us as well			0
' we 're going okay , we need to pick up some points away but our home form has been excellent			0
' it 's going to be tight , it 'll be a tight bottom third of the league this year			2
' @entity1 are the only team in @entity87 's top four divisions who have failed to pick up a point away from home this season			1
rangers have fared far better at @entity111 , where they host fellow newcomers @entity22 on saturday , but @entity0 admits his side 's away form must improve			1
' it 's been difficult , we 've played good teams and we 've found it hard - there 's not too many teams down the bottom who have got results away from home , ' @entity0 said			2
' the games we 've played have all been against good clubs who have been up there in the top eight			0
' maybe we have to find a system that will get us a result somewhere but we 've tried everything , every system in the book			0
' you have to keep going , it 'll turn , we 'll pick up a result away from home when you probably least expect it			0
' first and foremost though we have to concentrate on our home form this weekend and get a result against @entity22			0
