with temperatures predicted to fall below zero during @entity2 , you can easily forgive @entity4 and @entity5 players taking time out of their pre-match preparations to work on techniques for tackling the cold			1
@entity9 , which will be played in @entity11 's @entity10 , is likely to be among the chilliest events in @entity14 history , with the ongoing @entity16 front hitting the @entity18 's north eastern coast likely to send temperatures plummeting to around -2c by the time the teams kick off at 6.30pm			1
with the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game , it 's little surprise that both teams are turning to technology , including expensive heated benches , to ensure the low temperatures do n't get the best of their star players			1
a large tent is protecting the end zone area with the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game , it 's little surprise both teams are desperately trying to ensure the low temperatures do n't get the best of their star players working out exactly how the @entity5 and @entity4 plan to thwart the cold depends on who you ask			1
@entity5 backup quarterback @entity60 recalled asking teammates for advice about handling the temperature during his @entity14 debut as a rookie with the @entity66			0
the game was at @entity68 in december 2006 , and the wind chill put the temperature around -17			0
daytime high temperatures at the @entity10 will be @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , while the low will be @entity76 ( @entity75 ) ' a lot of the guys were like , ' when it gets that cold , there 's nothing you can do , ' @entity60 said			1
although @entity9 is unlikely to see temperatures dropping anywhere close to that low , a number of techniques picked up by players during rookie matches in the extreme cold are almost certain to be on display			1
tubs of @entity91 and long - sleeves shirts are two essential items in the battle to keep warm			0
by rubbing @entity91 on their arms , players create a layer of insulation that fills their pores and braces them against the wind			2
@entity4 safety @entity101 finds another benefit , too : ' when it 's cold and your skin 's dry [ and you get ] a scrape on the helmet , next thing you know , you 're bleeding profusely			1
just because your skin is so dry , it 's easier to get cut			2
' his teammate , kick returner @entity117 , disagrees : ' i do n't use those kinds of things			2
( the key is ) basically just keeping your mind off the cold			2
' although long - sleeves are outwardly a fairly obvious solution , wearing an undershirt beneath their team jersey is something few players are willing to consider			2
@entity4 safety @entity131 was among many who said they definitely would n't wear one , no matter how cold it gets : preparation : both @entity136 of the @entity5 ( left ) and @entity137 of the @entity4 ( right ) have been training in the cold of @entity11 before sunday 's big @entity9 clash drift : @entity141 is still piled high outside the main entrance to @entity10			1
temperatures may hit as low as -2 during sunday 's @entity2 clash cold job : workers shovel snow off the seating area at @entity10 in @entity11 as crews were tasked with removing snow ahead of sunday 's @entity9 he said : ' i feel like having sleeves is like wearing a sweater			1
makes me feel too heavy			2
' one key piece of kit that definitely separates the amateur circuit from the big leagues are heated benches			0
both sidelines will have 70 feet of heated benches that can be turned up by each team to its desired temperature - up to 90 degrees hotter than the air , the @entity14 said			0
@entity4 safety @entity164 is one player keen to seek out a spot			0
he said : ' once you 're in the game and running around , the adrenaline 's flowing , you 're fine			2
when you come to the sideline is when you really know it 's cold outside			1
so i use the heated benches			0
' @entity174 center @entity172 will stay away from the benches however , saying : ' i try not to get too warm on the sideline			0
it 's kind of a happy medium , i guess ... [ but ] i do n't like it to be too much of a shock when you get back out there on the field			0
' in warmer times : @entity2 organisers are hoping to have the famous @entity187 stadium and its surrounding areas free of snow by the time the teams kick off on sunday @entity9 will be played in @entity11 's @entity10			1
it is likely to be among the coldest matches in @entity14 history , with the ongoing @entity16 front continue to chill the @entity18 's north eastern coast another high - tech technique for keeping warm during the match will be giant tornado space heaters that are placed along each sideline when it gets cold			1
players often can be seen huddling around , getting a bit of warm air			0
@entity174 's defensive end @entity205 loves them , saying : ' we 'll be fine , as long as we have ... those heaters out there			0
' @entity4 tight end @entity209 is not so sure , however			0
he said : ' i 'm really a no - heater guy			0
' all the space heaters and temperature controlled benches in the world will make little difference to the players if they fail to follow the oldest advice in the book when it comes to keeping warm on the playing field , however			0
from top @entity14 stars to eight - year - old 's playing sunday league football , the advice is simple : keep moving			1
movement gets blood circulating around the body , stopping your body temperature falling as dramatically as it would if you were standing still			0
so as the temperature in @entity11 plummets late on sunday afternoon , expect to see plenty of not - in - play players doing lunges and star - jumps in the corner of your television screen .			1

daytime temperatures before sunday 's @entity2 are predicted to be @entity73
but that could fall as low as -2c by the 6.30pm kick off time
teams are desperately preparing their players for *challenging* cold weather
another @entity16 front has hit north east @entity18 bringing heavy snow and rain
