capturing moving objects with a normal camera usually leads to disappointment , especially if the object is travelling fast			2
but now there ’s a gadget for amateur photographers that allows them to take professional - looking motion photos			2
the @entity8 uses strobe lights to capture fleeting moments and its abilities have been showcased in a series of photographs showing ball bearings smashing into fruit , sweets , biscuits and light bulbs , among other objects			1
a shower of sugar can be seen coming from this lollipop the shots show the moments after impact - the showering of crumbs , sugar and glass , splitting skins and jets of juice			2
previously , such clarity could only be achieved through the use of expensive , high - voltage systems , but @entity46 , the firm behind the light , claims it enables amateur photographers to take high speed photographs with a basic dslr camera			1
the @entity52 rig captures moments that last just two millionths of a second and costs from £ 495 , putting it within reach of amateur photographers			1
the @entity61 - based company ’s founder , @entity59 , said : ‘ at that speed , you can see things that are just impossible for the human eye to recognise			1
the shots taken with the strobe light attatchment show the moments after impact - the showering of crumbs , splitting skins and jets of juice			1
this photograph shows a grape being shot with a ball bearing ans the incredible patterns the juice momentarily makes in mid air the @entity79 rig ( pictured back ( left ) and front ( right ) captures moments which last just two millionths of a second and costs from £ 495 , putting it within reach of amateur photographers previously , pictures like this , showing a @entity87 bauble exploding after being shot with a @entity89 pellet , could only be achieved through the use of expensive , high - voltage systems , but @entity46 , the firm behind the light , claims it enables amateur photographers to take high speed photographs with a basic dslr camera ‘ if you splat a grape at two millionths of a second , you can see the way that it uncurls the skin around it			1
’ the 35 - year - old explained that a super-fast flash is needed to capture such moments , because there is no shutter speed fast enough to snap a bullet or any other object travelling at a similar speed			2
‘ a normal bullet will travel seven metres in a millisecond , so there is normally no way you can take a photo of a bullet because it will just appear blurred , ’ he said			0
‘ the way that we do it is by using a slower shutter speed and a faster flash which simply freezes the image of a bullet in mid-air			0
‘ the @entity8 is a hundred times faster than any normal flash that you can buy on the market and means that amateur photographers can take photos of things that are going three times the speed of sound			0
’ @entity46 ' founder , @entity59 , said : ‘ the @entity79 ( pictured ) is a hundred times faster than any normal flash that you can buy on the market and means that amateur photographers can take photos of things that are going three times the speed of sound ’ mr @entity59 is raising money for the light on @entity137 and says he has already received interest from distributors in the @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 for his camera , which can capture moments in time like this - a biscuit being shot by a @entity89 pellet he has only photographed air bullets so far , but says : ‘ i can guarantee that it can capture real bullets because i 've accurately measured the speed of the flash			1

‘ this product will cost the same as a new lens for your camera and will mean that you will be able to take beautiful photos that very few people have been able to take before , ’ he said			0
‘ the current technology used for this kind of photography is based around high - voltage lighting			0
using such equipment is incredibly dangerous			0

i think that people are going to come up with amazing things			0
’ the @entity52 @entity137 campaign has over £ 16,000 of its £ 25,000 target just one day after opening , with some ‘ early bird ’ offers already sold out			1
