an @entity1 scholar claims to have made a controversial discovery that proves the entire story of @entity4 was made up by @entity6 aristocrats			1
@entity7 asserts that @entity8 did not start as a religion , but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the @entity12			1
he says he noticed a pattern forming when he was studying the only surviving account of first - century @entity15 , which he claims contains dozens of parallels between the life of a roman emperor and that of @entity4 in the @entity20			1
is @entity4 really a myth ? a @entity23 scholar claims he has uncovered new evidence that proves the @entity6 invented the entire life story of @entity4 @entity26 moment : @entity7 , above left , says he made his discovery while studying @entity30 by @entity31 , which he says contains dozens of parallels between @entity4 and roman emperor @entity33 mr @entity7 argues that these ancient ' confessions ' provide ' clear evidence ' that the biography of @entity4 is ' actually constructed , tip to stern , on prior stories , but especially on the biography of a @entity40 '			1
mr @entity7 accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time			1
but bible academic professor @entity45 , from the @entity46 , compared mr @entity7 's theory to a @entity49 fiction book			1
he told @entity50 : ' these types of theories are very common outside the academic world and are usually reserved for sensationalist literature			0
' they are virtually non-existent in the academic world			0
' he also suggested the theories are not taken seriously by experts			0
mr @entity45 said : ' people do debate about how much we can know about @entity4 , but the idea that @entity6 invented stories about @entity4 is outside of the academic world			1
' he added that this sort of theory can be ' irritating ' to religion academics			0
on his theory , mr @entity7 said : ' i present my work with some ambivalence as i do not want to directly cause @entity8 any harm , but this is important for our culture			1
' alert citizens need to know the truth about our past so we can understand how and why governments create false histories and false gods			0
' they often do it to obtain a social order that is against the best interests of the common people			0
' @entity84 by @entity85 : @entity7 , who will be presenting his findings at a talk in @entity88 later this month , said the @entity6 turned to subtler ways of keeping order when heavy - handed tactics failed @entity7 , who will be presenting his findings at a talk in @entity88 later this month , said the @entity6 turned to subtler ways of keeping order when heavy - handed tactics failed			1
he said : ' @entity95 sects in @entity96 at the time , who were waiting for a prophesied warrior @entity98 , were a constant source of violent insurrection during the first century			0
' when the @entity6 had exhausted conventional means of quashing rebellion , they switched to psychological warfare			2
' they surmised that the way to stop the spread of zealous @entity95 missionary activity was to create a competing belief system			0
' that 's when the " peaceful " @entity111 story was invented			0
' instead of inspiring warfare , this @entity111 urged turn - the - other - cheek pacifism and encouraged @entity95 to " give onto @entity40 " and pay their taxes to @entity6			2
' law and order : scholar @entity7 asserts that @entity8 did not start as a religion , but was instead created as a sophisticated propaganda tool to pacify subjects of the @entity12 ' once those sources are all laid bare , there 's simply nothing left , ' he added			1
he says he stumbled upon his discovery while studying @entity30 by @entity31 - the only remain first - person account of first - century @entity15 - alongside the @entity20			1
he said : ' i started to notice a sequence of parallels between the two texts			0
@entity7 ' although it 's been recognised by @entity8 scholars for centuries that the prophesies of @entity4 appear to be fulfilled by what @entity31 wrote about in the @entity134 , i was seeing dozens more			1
' what seems to have eluded many scholars is that the sequence of events and locations of @entity4 ministry are more or less the same as the sequence of events and locations of the military campaign of [ @entity146 ] @entity33 as described by @entity31			1
' however , according to @entity147 , @entity33 was born in 39 ad and died in 81 ad			2
estimates suggest @entity4 died before 39 ad – 30 ad according to the encyclopaedia			2
this was a number of years prior to @entity33 ’s military campaign			2
mr @entity7 continued : ' this is clear evidence of a deliberately constructed pattern			1
' the biography of @entity4 is actually constructed , tip to stern , on prior stories , but especially on the biography of a @entity40			1
' @entity7 said the clues had gone unnoticed all this time because they are coneptual or poetic			0
this , he says , was designed to prevent the average believer from becoming aware of what was happening			0
they did , however , want the alert reader to cotton on			0
@entity4 appearing to @entity165 by @entity166 : mr @entity7 accepts that his theory will upset some believers but is confident that it will be accepted in good time he adds : ' an educated @entity6 in the ruling class would probably have recognised the literary game being played			1
' @entity7 maintains he can demonstrate that ' the @entity173 left us a kind of puzzle literature that was meant to be solved by future generations , and that the solution to that puzzle is " we invented @entity4 and we 're proud of it "			2
' @entity7 does not believe that this is the end of @entity8 , but hopes his work will give half - believers a reason to ' make a clean break '			2
' we 've got the evidence now to show exactly where the story of @entity4 came from , ' he says			0
roman general @entity188 conquered @entity190 in 63 bc. estimates suggest @entity4 was born between 6 - 4 @entity192 , and died around 30 ad			2
roman emperor @entity33 was born in 39 ad and died in 81 ad			1
the first @entity95 revolt occurred between 66 - 70 ad , the first in a long series of clashes up until 135 ad			0
' although @entity8 can be a comfort to some , it can also be very damaging and repressive , an insidious form of mind control that has led to blind acceptance of serfdom , poverty , and war throughout history			0
' to this day , especially in the @entity1 , it is used to create support for war in the @entity210			0
' @entity7 will be giving a presentation on his findings entitled @entity111 at @entity213 in @entity214 , @entity88 , on october 19 , where he is encouraging sceptics to challenge his theory , according to a release published on @entity219 .			0

claims dozens of hidden parallels between emperor @entity33 and @entity4
