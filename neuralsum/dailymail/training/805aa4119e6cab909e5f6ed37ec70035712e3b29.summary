by @entity0 the former vice-madam plans to publish a book describing her alleged connection with the politician the former dominatrix has had her home raided by police weeks before the release of her autobiography in which she makes fresh claims about @entity11			1
up to 12 drugs squad officers searched @entity14 's flat for two hours but found nothing			2
miss @entity14 , who once used the name ' @entity16 ' claimed it was an attempt to smear her ahead of the book 's publication later this month			2
her memoirs are expected to be embarrassing for mr @entity11 , who was allegedly a regular guest at parties at her flat in the early 1990s			1
mr @entity11 was embroiled in a scandal in 2005 , when a picture surfaced showing him in his twenties sitting alongside @entity27 when she was working as a dominatrix known as ' mistress pain '			1
miss @entity14 said her home , in @entity31 , west @entity32 , was raided just 48 hours after a paper revealed the book 's release date			1
she claims that while they raided her home one officer asked her about the book and another told her it would open ' a whole can of worms ' if she complained			1
she told the @entity42 : ' i 'm not into conspiracy theories			0
' i 'd like to think the fact that i 've been unfairly targeted by the police has nothing to do with the fact that my book is about to be published , which happens to be very embarrassing for the chancellor			1
' but it 's certainly made me wonder			0
' the former madam claims that her home was raided on october 2 , and she was locked in her living room while police searched her home			2
they told her they had been tipped off by a member of the public that there were drugs in her property - a claim that miss @entity14 strongly denies			2
she claims that she was not allowed to call a lawyer and officer spent nearly two hours combing her home for drugs , but they did not find any			2
apparently the autobiographical book will contain ' embarrassing revelations ' about @entity11 , who was pictured with miss @entity14 when he was in his twenties she says that she warned them not to read the manuscript of her book , which she had left on her bed , and was asked if she was ' writing her memoirs '			1
miss @entity14 also claims that when she called up to complain about how police stormed her home , she was told that she was about to ' open up a whole can of worms '			1
the former dominatrix has made an official complaint to @entity82 and plans to contact the @entity83			2

miss @entity14 has previously claimed that mr @entity11 knew that she had an escort agency and once discovered whips and sex toys in her apartment			1
she said he had ' found it quite amusing			0
’ she said the party at which mr @entity11 was photographed was held to celebrate her becoming pregnant by mr @entity84			1
she added : ‘ it was definitely cocaine on the table			0
‘ i remember vividly on that particular night i said to @entity11 , jokingly , " when you are prime minister one day i will have all the dirty goods on you " and he laughed			0
although the picture was taken before mr @entity11 entered politics , it was published when he had taken centre stage in the conservative party as shadow chancellor			1
his response was to deny that there was cocaine on the table and insisted that any suggestion that he took drugs was ' defamatory and completely untrue			0
' a @entity118 spokesman said : ' following information received , officers based in @entity120 and @entity31 obtained a warrant to search an address under @entity124 of the @entity125 on october 2			0
