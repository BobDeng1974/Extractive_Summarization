' @entity8 rang from hospital and @entity38 answered and asked , ' is dad there with you ? ' @entity41 told @entity48			1
' he told us both to sit down in a really low , horrible voice			2
i was assuming the worst , but then i realised that if he was ringing then he must be alright , ' he said			0
' after we got off the phone we broke down and tried to console each other and then it was a mad thing of ' what do we do , ring the insurance company , get some flights			1
' @entity8 had been prepped for surgery when he was informed that his insurance company was refusing to pay the medical bills because he had been drinking			1
' @entity38 had to max out her credit cards to get him the surgery , and since then it 's cost us $ 6,000 a week just for him to stay in hospital , ' said @entity41			1
' he 's going to be there for at least another six or seven weeks , and i 'm not sure where we 're going to get the money from			0
' ' money does n't mean anything to me			0
if i have to live in a hut for the rest of my life , i do n't care			0
that 's why you have kids			0

in order to do this , he has to prove that he is experiencing significant hardship , which means getting staff from the hospital in @entity14 to sign a form attesting to @entity8 's condition			0
the form needs to be translated , which is more money , before it can be looked at by the staff - and in the meantime @entity8 is languishing in the hospital with only his mum by his side			2

' i know there are processes and i understand that , but it takes time and we do n't have time			0
' ' when he went in for the operation i said to @entity38 that i wished it was me , and not him			1
i do n't think there 's anything wrong with the hospital , but who wants their son half a world away ? ' @entity41 is juggling running the @entity135 apartments which he and his wife manage with supporting his family long distance and frantically trying to raise the money they need to come home			1
' i know there will be some people out there saying , what a drop kick , he was drunk , but he 'd blown the equivalent of three glasses of wine			0
' ' the thing i keep saying is that it could be anyone 's kid , which is scary '			0
local @entity153 , who knows the family well and started the fundraising page for @entity35 , said that she could n't believe that the policy was void simply because he 'd had a few drinks			1

' this could happen to anyone			0
how many people travel and think they 'll be covered , and how many parents are n't aware that their children might not have access to the medical help they need ? ' ' the family has already spent more than $ 20,000 , where are they meant to get the rest ? ' @entity32 have been contacted for confirmation of their policy details , something which @entity41 has quizzed them on			1
' i posed a hypothetical question to them , and asked that if i was overseas and shared a bottle of wine with my wife , and looked one way before crossing but forgot to look the other , and was hit by a car , would i be covered ? ' he said			2
' they could n't answer me			0
but that 's the same level alcohol as @entity8			2
i just do n't know what the world is coming to			0
' the @entity201 's are hoping to raise the funds they need to bring @entity8 home through the their crowdfunding page			2
' the response has been amazing , and everyone has been so supportive , ' said @entity153			0
' i think it 's because @entity8 is such a vivacious and bubbly person , a really out there character			0
