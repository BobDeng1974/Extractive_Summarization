scientists at a @entity2 company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products			1
the liquid is called @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , and instantly hardens upon impact at any temperature			1
in a ' liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high - speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area			1
instead @entity9 hardens upon impact at any temperature , providing protection from penetration by high - speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area			1
' this viscosity increases thanks to the subordination of the particles in the liquid structure , therefore they form a barrier against an external penetrating factor , ' said @entity47 , who performed tests on the @entity9 for @entity49			1
the exact composition of the @entity9 is known only to @entity51 and its inventors at the @entity53 in @entity54 , but ballistic tests proved its resistance to a wide range of projectiles			2
' we needed to find , design a liquid that functions both with projectiles hitting at the velocity of 450 meters per second and higher			2
' we have succeeded , ' said deputy director for research at the @entity49 institute , @entity63			1
@entity63 said the liquid 's stopping capability , combined with the lower indentation of its surface , provides a higher safety level for the user compared with traditional , mostly @entity72 - based , solutions			2
' if a protective vest is fitted to the body , then a four centimeter deep deflection may cause injury to the sternum , sternum fracture , myocardial infarction , lethal damage to the spleen , ' @entity63 said			0
' thanks to the properties of the liquid , thanks to the proper formation of the insert , we eliminate one hundred percent of this threat because we have reduced the deflection from four centimeters to one centimeter			0
' the liquid has been used to create lightweight flexible sheets , which can be placed inside the body armour when hit by a high - speed projectile , a wide area of the @entity9 hardens instantly , causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer 's internal organs			1
implementing the solution in body armor required designing special inserts , but the company says those are lighter than standard ballistic inserts and broader range of movement for their users in the police and military			0
' the point is for them not to interfere , not change the way of movement , operation of such the product by the user , and at the same time increase their motor skills , increase effectiveness of their decision process and increase their possibilities during the mission at hand , ' @entity63 said			0
a @entity121 test shows the material hardening on impact			2
researchers have already tested the material in existing body armour designs			0
the laboratory is also working on a magnetorheological fluid , which they hope can be also applied in their products			0
according to the researchers , both liquids can find applications beyond body armor , such as in the production of professional sports inserts , and even entire outfits			0
another use could be in car bumpers or road protective barriers .			0
