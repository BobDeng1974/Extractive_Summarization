by @entity0 last updated at 10:18 am on 16th november 2011 former head of the @entity2 gives evidence to mps investigating the row over @entity7 border checks a bombshell inquiry has found the head of the @entity2 relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ‘ quick wins ’ to reduce queues at airports			1
a leaked draft copy of a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of @entity19 – who yesterday denied being a ‘ rogue ’ civil servant – reveals fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the @entity7 were relaxed on 164 occasions			2
this was despite the home secretary explicitly saying that , even in ‘ extremis ’ , this must not happen in case it allowed those from terrorist hotspots such as the @entity33 to enter unchecked			2
staff also casually referred to a pilot authorised by @entity36 – which did controversially relax checks on @entity40 biometric passports and children travelling with their parents or on school trips – as ‘ children and chips ’			0
but the investigation , by former police officer @entity46 , concludes mr @entity19 – who yesterday denied any wrongdoing in a dramatic appearance before mps – had a ‘ case to answer ’ that he had broken the @entity52			1
had he not resigned , this could have led to his dismissal			0
the report by mr @entity46 , the @entity56 ’s head of enforcement and crime , which is likely to be published next week , supports mrs may ’s claim that mr @entity19 had relaxed border checks without her approval			1
mr @entity19 has said this claim was ‘ wrong ’ – putting mrs may ’s career on the line by implying she had misled @entity66			1
the internal inquiry , one of three into the scandal , paints a picture of how the civil service threw open the @entity7 ’s borders			0
but it is the confirmation that mr @entity19 did not have approval to go further , by relaxing visa checks on @entity78 nationals , that will be most significant at @entity79 and be seen as vindication of @entity82 ’s decision to back mrs may			1
offered 100k then trashed the report – titled ‘ formal misconduct procedures ’ – makes clear that mr @entity19 had been agitating since january this year for the government to relax border controls and was looking for ‘ quick wins ’ to prevent chaos at airports			1
he initially suggested three measures : not routinely opening the biometric chips on passports belonging to @entity40 nationals ; not routinely checking the fingerprints of foreign nationals requiring a visa and not routinely checking the documents of @entity40 children travelling with their parents or on a school trip			0
immigration minister @entity102 ’s office initially said he may be content to support the proposals but wanted more details of their impact			0
in april , mr @entity19 was sent a response from mrs may ’s office saying neither she nor mr @entity102 was ‘ content to agree ’ to the changes			1
giving evidence : @entity19 ( facing the panel ) speaking during a @entity112 meeting in the @entity113 , @entity114 suspended : home secretary @entity36 suspended @entity19 , claiming he went further than what she had agreed to , local media reported the report then highlights an e-mail from mr @entity19 to a senior official in the @entity56 which lays bare his concerns that mrs may will not do what he wants			1
it says : ‘ i am now very concerned about the impact of the summer pressures at the border			0
i am of the view that procedural changes will not be in place in time for the main pressure period			0
home secretary @entity36 may leaving 10 @entity131 yesterday ‘ i have little confidence that the home secretary will sign - off the changes ( in time / at all ) and we seem to have lost some of the urgency around getting this dealt with			0
’ a string of further emails are exchanged between mr @entity19 ’s office and mrs may ’s			2
one , dated july 19 , tells mr @entity19 : ‘ i can confirm you do not have authorisation to go to scenario 3 ( suspending fingerprint checks ) in any circumstances			1
’ mr @entity19 later asks again if he could move to ‘ @entity146 ’ in ‘ absolute extremis ’			2
he was informed on july 26 the answer was that he could not – ‘ in any circumstances ’			0
the report goes on to detail how senior staff had informed mr @entity19 that they had taken ‘ additional measures ’ which went beyond those authorised by ministers			1
on two occasions , details of these ‘ additional measures ’ were included in weekly reports for ministers – but they ‘ remained with @entity19 ’s @entity160 ’ and were not sent to mrs may or mr @entity102			0
the scandal was finally uncovered after a visit by @entity163 , chief inspector of immigration , to @entity165			0
he alerted mr @entity19 ’s superiors , who quizzed him about what had been happening			2
at this point , the report says mr @entity19 conceded that checks on fingerprints for those needing a visa had been suspended on 164 occasions over the past year – 156 times at @entity165			1
one very senior official said he could not ‘ possibly understand ’ how mr @entity19 believed he had the authority for his actions			2
the report , which is likely to be published next week , concludes that : ‘ i am clear that the evidence available would have led to a recommendation , should @entity179 still be a civil servant , that he has a case to answer in that he has not met the standards articulated in the various parts of the [ @entity184 ’			0
it adds : ‘ the home secretary authorised a time limited pilot to enable @entity2 to move to @entity190 checks [ not checking the chips on @entity40 passports or @entity40 children travelling with their families or on school trips against the @entity197 ] when queues became unmanageable , and then only for the period needed			1
no other reductions in border controls were authorised , even in “ absolute extremis ”			0

@entity19 relaxed vital immigration checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ' quick wins ' to reduce queues at airports
a report supports the home secretary *'s* claim that mr @entity19 had relaxed border checks without her approval
