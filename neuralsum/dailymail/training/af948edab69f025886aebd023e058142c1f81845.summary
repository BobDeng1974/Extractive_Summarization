@entity0 is a man who likes a challenge			1
he must be some sort of @entity3			2
skipper little @entity4 to the @entity6 title ? captain @entity7 did it			1
get an 18 - month deal out of @entity10 knowing there is no chance you ’ll see more than one - third of it through ? @entity15 sorted it			2
@entity0 will need to have superhuman abilities to restore the glory years at @entity19 @entity0 faces a relegation struggle but @entity19 's @entity22 progress is something to cling on to get a decent game out of @entity25 ? the @entity26 managed it			1
salute a footballer in front of thousands of people but somehow keep your reputation intact ? @entity33 did it			2
instead of a cape , he wears a gilet			2
but succeeding at this latest challenge for @entity7 will be like achieving the impossible			2
managing @entity19 has now become the job nobody can do			1
he has an owner with a much - reduced level of interest to match the much - reduced budget			2
but at the same time he has a set of fans who understandably but unrealistically demand good football , success and a challenge towards the top end of the table			0
they expect to be in the top six , not the bottom three			0
@entity0 captained @entity4 to the @entity6 title in 1995 @entity0 also managed to get the best out of striker @entity25 during his time at @entity58 @entity19 have slipped into the relegation zone and face a fight to retain their @entity6 status we ’ll never know if @entity63 was destined to take @entity19 down , but he had lost his way			1
bringing in @entity65 , who subsequently upset some players , almost certainly changed the squad ’s view of @entity63 , and precipitated his departure			0
@entity0 needs to keep players onside – it will be interesting to see if he does that : remember his blast at @entity58 players after their defeat at @entity75 ? he needs to get @entity19 playing a bit of football , scoring goals and in the short term , keep them up			1
if he ’s confident of doing that then he should absolutely go all out to win the @entity22			1
if he does that then that creates a bit of history nobody can ever take away from him			0
and @entity19 fans love a bit of history			1
a trip to @entity89 will leave you in no doubt this is a big club			0
reminders of the title win in 1981 and the @entity95 win the year after are everywhere – as they should be			0
@entity63 was sacked as @entity19 manager on february 11 after nearly three years in charge @entity63 's decision to bring in @entity65 as his assistant caused more divisions in the squad but times are tough right now , and the recent memory of their inferior city rivals @entity105 even managing to win a trophy at @entity107 makes the taste of failure even worse			1
@entity19 do n’t get enough credit for that 1982 @entity112 glory			1
they ’re the @entity114 success story from that era that fell down the back of the sofa while everyone was too busy listening to the great @entity119 deliver endless soundbites at @entity121 or watching the glorious @entity123 side			0
somehow they kept the goal machines of @entity125 – they ’d scored seven in the semi-final – quiet			0
the tournament ’s top three scorers – @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 - all drew a blank that night in @entity133 , against a rookie keeper in @entity135 , on for the injured @entity136 after just nine minutes			0
those glories are light years away of course			0
@entity136 ( left ) and @entity135 show off the @entity95 after @entity19 's triumph over @entity125 in 1982 @entity142 ( left ) , manager @entity140 ( middle ) and @entity135 bring home the trophy from @entity133 but bear this in mind : title - winning manager @entity147 left in february 1982 , and @entity140 took over with the club already into the quarter - finals of the @entity95 which they went on to win			1
@entity63 has just gone – it ’s february			0
and @entity0 takes over with the club already into the quarter - finals of the @entity22			1
it ’s not quite that great @entity19 side of 1982 with the leadership of @entity156 , the vision of @entity158 , the goals of @entity160 and @entity142 , and the wing wizardry of @entity162			1
but it might possibly be some sort of omen for @entity19 fans to cling on to			2
they ’re so desperate right now they ’ll cling on to any sort of hope they can find			0
@entity172 ( left ) celebrates with @entity173 and @entity174 after scoring in the @entity22 against @entity175 @entity176 ( right ) celebrates with @entity173 after scoring @entity19 's opener against @entity175 on sunday can @entity0 boldly go on mission impossible once again ? or will his gilet self - destruct in five seconds ? we salute you @entity7 for stepping up to the @entity19 plate and trying to become football ’s own comic book hero – take @entity19 back to the big time and you ’ll be better than @entity186			1
in fact you ’ll become @entity188			0
just do n’t appoint @entity65 as your assistant .			0

@entity0 was *announced* as new @entity19 boss this week
he has produced a superhuman effort as a player and a manager
but saving @entity19 from @entity6 relegation may prove beyond him
however , their @entity22 progress gives reasons to be *cheerful*
they will host @entity203 in the sixth round of the competition
