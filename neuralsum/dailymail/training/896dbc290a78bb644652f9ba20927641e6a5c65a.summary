by @entity0 scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment using a super-charged ion collider could accidentally destroy planet earth			2
one of the world ’s most powerful particle accelerators , which is capable of generating particles hotter than four trillion degrees @entity11 , has come under the spotlight after experts have warned that micro black holes and strange matter could be generated			1
the @entity17 ’s @entity16 ( @entity18 ) accelerates nuclei to the speed of light , before smashing them together in a bid to create quark - gluon plasma , which is an incredibly hot substance thought to have occurred just after the @entity24			1
the @entity18 – the world ’s second most powerful particle accelerator after @entity46 ’s @entity45 ( @entity45 ) - is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters			2
the @entity51 ( @entity18 ) pictured , accelerates nuclei to the speed of light , before smashing them together in a bid to create quark - gluon plasma , which is an incredibly hot substances thought to have occurred just after the @entity24 with the upgrade , the @entity18 will be able to generate collisions 20 times stronger than when it was originally built , prompting legal experts to question whether the facility also needs to perform a more thorough risk assessment			1
@entity63 , associate professor of law at the @entity64 and @entity65 , professor @entity66 at @entity67 wrote in a piece for the @entity69 that the facility should be re-evaluated for its potential to create a huge scale disaster that could wipe out life on @entity6			2
since the @entity18 was built , scientists have discovered the @entity75 as well as quark - gluon plasma , which is not like anything that humans have ever known			1
the two legal experts argue that same commission that has recently probed the cost of the @entity86 @entity88 ’s labs , should also ‘ take a sober look at one experimental programme that raises a bizarre and little - discussed prospect of destroying the entire planet			2
’ the @entity18 , the world 's second most powerful particle accelerator after @entity46 's @entity45 , is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters			0
the @entity95 at @entity18 ( @entity96 ) - a detector that tracks the particles produced by each ion collision - is pictured scientists are worried that micro black holes and ‘ strangelets ’ could be created			1
strangelets are a hypothetical form of quark matter that in specific conditions could trigger a chain reaction to convert everything else to strange matter and destroy the planet			0
@entity111 and @entity63 are particularly concerned that low energy experiments could boost the risk of creating strangelets and a recent report has shown that mini black holes can be generated from less energy than originally thought			1
there were similar concerns when @entity46 ’s @entity45 began its quest to find the ‘ @entity128 particle , ’ even though it is unlikely that stable black holes can be created by particle accelerators and even if they were , they could not suck in matter in a way that could threaten the planet , @entity118 reported			1
two legal experts have called for a risk assessment to look into the risks of producing catestrophic chain reactions at national laboratories , including @entity17			1
the phenix detector at the @entity18 is pictured			0
it records many different particles emerging from @entity18 collisions , including quark - containing particles called hadrons where there were a number of reports investigating the chances of a catastrophic chain reaction arising from experiments , the legal duo pointed out that they were published more than six years ago and things have changes since then			1
professors @entity65 and @entity63 wrote : ‘ the original [ @entity18 ] report assumed the @entity18 would only run for a planned 10 years			0
but thanks to program extensions , the @entity18 is now entering its 15th year			0
‘ the machine has also been continuously upgraded since the report ... the suitability of models and assumptions used in the original analysis might be profitably reappraised			0
’ they have called for ' rigorous , independent risk analysis it [ the @entity18 ] has long warranted			0
’ in august 2012 physicists at @entity46 's @entity45 broke a record by achieving the hottest man - made temperatures ever - 100,000 times hotter than the interior of the @entity168 scientists there collided lead ions to create a searingly hot sub-atomic soup known as quark - gluon plasma at about 5.5trillion degrees @entity11 , the hottest temperature ever recorded in an experiment			1
it was about 40 per cent hotter than the old record , set by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) at @entity17 , @entity178 , by smashing gold ions together			0
scientists believe that at the point in our universe 's history quarks and gluons – basic building blocks of matter – were not confined inside composite particles such as protons and neutrons , as they are today			0
instead , they moved freely in a state of matter known as ' quark – gluon plasma '			2
collisions of lead ions in the @entity45 , the world ’s most powerful particle accelerator , recreate for a fleeting moment conditions similar to those of the early universe			0
by examining a billion or so of these collisions , the experiments were able to make more precise measurements of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions .			0

@entity17 ’s @entity16 is *due* to get an upgrade and experts think it should have a risk assessment *overhaul*
experiment aims to generate quark - gluon plasma but could accidentally create micro black holes and subatomic particles called strangelets
astronomer royal @entity41 warned that strangelets could transform @entity6 into ‘ an inert hyperdense sphere '
