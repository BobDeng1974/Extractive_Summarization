as a result , the police had to assess their ongoing security arrangements and put additional security measures in place			0
mr @entity51 said : ‘ by his actions the defendant caused the release into the public domain of information about how the police managed protection operations in relation to principals , the people being protected , such as members of the @entity58 and former prime ministers - information which the police , for obvious reasons , try to keep confidential			2
‘ as a result of these articles the police had to conduct a number of assessments in relation to the arrangements made for protecting those principals			2

‘ it is worth considering a little more closely what the defendant was doing during his final few days at work , ’ said the barrister			0
