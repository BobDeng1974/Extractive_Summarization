they were the two best friends who decided - after finding themselves single at the same time - to date for 40 days to see what happened			1
the pair blogged about their experience and wrote a book , 40 @entity15 which is out now @entity17 - based designers @entity3 and @entity4 decided to embark upon their 40 day experiment two years ago after finding themselves partner-less			1
the couple , who described themselves as complete opposites - she 's the hopeless romantic and he 's a charming lothario - would then share their experiences in a series of blogs			2
however , despite the fact that there was clearly some chemistry between the two and they even ended up sleeping together ( on day 25 ) their relationship did n't work out			2
in fact just one month after their time together @entity3 met her husband , cinematographer @entity34			1
but while she and @entity4 might not have gone the distance some good did come out of their 40 days together			1
they have now turned their story into a book to be released this month named 40 @entity15 : the experiment and it 's already been optioned for a movie			1
just a month after her 40 days was up @entity3 met cinematographer @entity34 , who she went on to marry speaking of the experience , which both @entity3 and @entity4 have previously described as a positive one , @entity3 said the pair had wanted to iron out their relationship issues			1
' @entity47 was a commitment - phobe and i was a hopeless romantic , ' @entity3 told news.com.au			1
' i had just gotten out of a relationship and was heartbroken			0
@entity47 had the exact opposite issue where he was dating five girls at once and could n't commit			0
we were like , ' what 's wrong with us ? how can we fix this ? ' the couple decided to date for 40 days			1
as part of the agreement they 'd see each other every day and even take a weekend break together			0
they also decided that they would n't date anyone else while taking part			0
they now admit that they had definitely been attracted to one another and that their pals had been worried about what might happen to their friendship			2
@entity47 said : ' when we told our friends about it they were really against it , because we did have a great friendship and they were worried that we could ruin our friendship and end up hating each other			0
' now when we look back on it there was definitely a part of us that was attracted to each other , but we were too afraid to admit that to each other because we were such good friends			0
' and @entity3 says the experiment changed her for the better and that her new husband - who happily allowed @entity47 to come to their wedding - does n't mind that the two once dated			1
' i learned to just be myself and not worry so much , ' said @entity3			2
' after the experiment i was in a really good mindset and just having fun with it all			2
' i told him [ her husband ] about what @entity47 and i had done			0
at that point the blog was n’t live yet			0
he ’s a creative person too and he thought it was a really cool idea			0
' @entity47 is still single but says he 's now a lot more ' open and vulnerable ' .			0

close pals @entity3 and @entity4 dated for 40 days
they blogged about their experience and turned it into a book
although @entity3 wed another man , they say the experiment was positive
