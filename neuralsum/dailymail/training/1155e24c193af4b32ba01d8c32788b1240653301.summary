@entity0 is a man notorious for his tattoos , and the former @entity3 international cricketer has inked his body once more ... this time with a map of the world			1
in a picture posted on his @entity11 site , the @entity8 - born batsman showed off his new design , stretching from his chest around to his back			0
the map , which @entity0 insists is not the wrong way around - ' just the reflection ! ' - has red stars on certain places around the globe ... but what exactly do they signify ? @entity0 posted a picture of him getting the tattoo , as he takes a break from the @entity25 ' it is n't the wrong way around			1
it 's just the reflection ' ... @entity0 reassures fans that his tattoo of a map of the world is n't inaccurate			2
each red star indicates somewhere @entity0 has scored an international century @entity34 ( 23 ) @entity35 ( 15 ) the @entity36 , @entity38 x 4 lord ’s , @entity38 x 5 @entity40 , @entity41 x 3 @entity42 , @entity44 x 1 @entity45 , @entity46 x 1 @entity47 , @entity49 x 1 @entity50 ( 2 ) @entity36 , @entity52 x 2 @entity53 ( 2 ) @entity54 , @entity56 x 1 @entity57 , @entity58 x 1 @entity59 ( 1 ) @entity60 , @entity61 @entity62 ( 1 ) @entity63 , @entity64 @entity65 ( 1 ) @entity66 , @entity67 @entity68 ( 1 ) @entity69 , @entity70 @entity71 ( 9 ) @entity72 ( 3 ) @entity73 , @entity74 x 1 @entity75 , @entity38 x 1 @entity76 , @entity78 x 1 @entity65 ( 2 ) @entity79 , @entity81 x 1 sir @entity82 , @entity84 x 1 @entity85 ( 2 ) @entity86 , @entity87 x2 @entity35 ( 1 ) @entity88 , @entity89 @entity53 ( 1 ) @entity90 , @entity91 each mark represents a place that @entity0 has scored an international century for @entity3 - be it test or @entity71 - including the @entity35 , @entity72 , @entity62 and @entity50			1
he has scored 32 international tons , 23 of those in @entity34 matches for @entity3 over a career spanning nearly nine years			2
@entity0 made his test debut in an @entity100 triumph in 2005 , scoring his maiden ton in the final test at @entity103 - noted by a red star on his rib			0
@entity0 , celebrating @entity3 's @entity100 victory in 2005 , shows off his @entity108 tattoo to fans the batsman is well - known for his tattoos ; on his bicep he marks the first three of his four @entity100 victories he finished the series as top scorer , with 473 runs over the five @entity34 - and a highest average of 52.55 too			1
there are seven countries in which @entity0 has scored a @entity34 century - @entity3 , @entity50 , @entity68 , @entity59 , @entity62 , @entity53 and the @entity65 - while @entity72 and the @entity85 are added to his tattoo with odi hundreds			1
before it was clear what the stars indicated , an initial theory was that they marked locations in which @entity0 has played cricket ; a missing star in the @entity130 area dispelled that particular idea			2
indeed , @entity0 is currently plying his trade in southern @entity50 , in the @entity25 for @entity133			2
there is a star in @entity52 , the location of @entity0 's @entity3 centuries in 2006 and 2010 , but not in the far south of @entity130			0
@entity0 himself fuelled the speculation on thursday morning when he tweeted : ' work the stars out yourself on my last @entity11 post ! ' @entity0 congratulates his @entity133 team - mate @entity143 as he reaches 50 in the @entity25 @entity0 bats for @entity133 against @entity145 on january 10 , where he scored 49 the batsman is currently averaging 39 runs across five innings in the @entity150 , who sit fourth of eight in the standings			1
and it appears @entity0 is enjoying his time down under , finding himself a ' superstar tattooist ' in @entity130			0
in his autobiography , the 34 - year - old was honest in his assessment of his tattoos , admitting that he ' overplayed his englishness ' in getting @entity108 inked on his shoulder			0
lets hope he does n't feel the same way about his new addition in years to come			0
@entity0 spent almost nine years playing international cricket for @entity3 , scoring 32 centuries overall @entity0 celebrates winning his third and final ashes by kissing the famous trophy left : @entity171 's @entity170 tattooed a @entity173 trophy on his shoulder , despite not making a single appearance for his country at the competition in @entity177 ... right : @entity179 midfielder @entity178 has a huge tattoo of wings covering his entire back ... to clarify , he still ca n't fly left : perhaps the most infamous of football tattoos is @entity184 's			1
he uses an armoury of different weapons to create the word ' love ' down his left side			0
right : @entity189 , now of @entity190 , tattooed his own surname onto his face a few years ago			0

@entity0 is currently playing cricket for @entity133 in @entity50
