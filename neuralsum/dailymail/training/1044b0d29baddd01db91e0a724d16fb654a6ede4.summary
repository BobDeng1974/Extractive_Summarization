boxing icon @entity0 admitted he was close to tears after being made a @entity3 of his home city of @entity5 on thursday night			1
the @entity8 and @entity9 world super-middleweight champion joined sporting legends @entity10 and @entity12 and @entity13 in receiving the honour			1
@entity0 , who wore a purple suit by sir @entity16 , another @entity3 of @entity5 , was handed an official scroll by @entity19 leader @entity18 in front of 2,000 fans at the @entity22 in @entity5			1
@entity0 holds the scroll in front of statue of legendary football manager @entity10 the 37 - year - old told the @entity27 : ' i 'm in the process of having a cabinet built at my house and i will put the scroll in with my world title belts			1
' people say ' well what does the @entity3 of the city give you ? ' it 's not about that			0
it 's about what it symbolises			0
and , for me , it symbolises an acknowledgement from my wonderful city which is proud of my achievements			0
' i could cry if i carried on talking about it â€“ it means that much to me			0
@entity0 was handed an official scroll by @entity19 leader @entity18 ( left ) @entity8 and @entity9 world super-middleweight champion @entity0 also had a tram named after him ' but there was one thing i had to do before the night was over and that was to have my picture taken with the @entity10 statue with the scroll in my hand			1
' what a man and what he legend he is			0
that picture will mark the day as such a special occasion and will go in with the scroll and my world title belts			0
' earlier , @entity0 has admitted he is ready to call time on his glittering career if the @entity8 and @entity9 world super-middleweight champion is denied his dream fight against @entity69			1
the 37 - year - old wants a showdown against the @entity72 in the boxing capital of @entity74 to complete his career bucket list			1
@entity0 may have thrown his last punch if he 's denied showdown with @entity69 talks have taken place over a multi-million pound fight early in 2015 but @entity80 appears reluctant to face the @entity5 fighter , who does not want to take on another @entity83 challenger at this late stage in his career			1
@entity0 told @entity86 : ' that 's where i am on it			2
i 've told that to @entity92			0
' he said ' you ca n't do that ' and you know what i can , because if that right hand i threw that connected with @entity98 ' chin in front of 80,000 people at the national stadium - if that 's the last punch i throw in my career , i will still be smiling			2
' @entity104 , who takes on @entity105 on november 22 , is the @entity9 mandatory challenger to @entity0 , but the fight does not hold much appeal to @entity0			2
@entity0 is not keen on another @entity83 showdown against @entity9 mandatory challenge @entity104 ( right ) he added : ' i do n't need to risk putting my legacy at stake for another @entity83 pretender who 's not earned his stripes and without giving @entity104 any stick - he 's an @entity116 gold medalist , he 's done well - he 's not quite earned his stripes , but he 's mandatory for the @entity9 belt			2
' do i fight him ? do i take him seriously ? yes , but if the @entity80 fight can happen in @entity74 for me , that is the one			0
' if the @entity80 fight does n't happen , there 's a strong chance of me retiring a happy man			0
