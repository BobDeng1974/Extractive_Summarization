what more can @entity1 do to force his way back into the middle ? out on the left wing against @entity5 , where he has moved to make way for @entity8 since his return from injury , he cut a frustrated figure for much of the game			1
but when he started making runs through the middle , testing @entity5 defenders and putting them on the back foot with his pace , the chances came			2
after 70 minutes , that was rewarded with a wonderful individual goal			0
@entity1 takes on young @entity5 defender @entity21 at @entity22 @entity8 , voted @entity24 's player of the month for february , holds off the challenge of @entity26 the talk ahead of kick - off was that @entity1 simply does not perform as well when @entity8 is on the pitch			1
in the first 45 minutes , they exchanged the ball a total of three times			0
that ’s not to say that every player on the pitch must combine at all times , but @entity24 fans are within their rights to expect £ 72.5million worth of talent , playing next to each other in an attacking midfield trio , to develop some kind of wavelength			2
in the first half @entity1 , @entity24 ’s best player this season by far , could not get into the game on the flank , making way for @entity8 as no 10 since his comeback from injury			1
in october , there were stories in @entity54 , from newspaper @entity55 , that @entity1 and @entity8 had fallen out			1
@entity1 felt the @entity57 was not giving him enough opportunities on the pitch , it was reported			2
from this performance , he would have a point			0
it took 22 minutes before they found one another , @entity1 passing into his team - mate			1
@entity1 cut in from the left hand side to score from a tight angle and end is run of eight games without a goal @entity1 celebrates doubling @entity24 's lead mid way through the second half at @entity22 at one stage , the @entity54 was screaming for the ball wide and free on the left , but @entity8 went to play the switch and instead feinted			1
but perhaps it is not even about the pair of them being on the pitch together so much as @entity1 being wasted on the left			2
by the 62nd minute , he was clearly frustrated out wide when he made a run down the wing and @entity84 failed to send the ball into his path			0
he let his team - mate know			0
in one red - hot period after he scored his first goal for the club against @entity89 he netted 12 in 14 games , from august to the start of november			2
now it is just one in eight games , coinciding with @entity8 ’s return			2
when he ventured into the middle in the 47th minute , carried the ball into the box with a step - over before aiming one for the far right bottom corner , it was hard to see why he is not guaranteed a central spot all the time			0
he repeated the act in the 58th minute , growing in confidence with every shot on goal			0
these two acts alone far exceeded anything @entity8 produced			0
former @entity109 playmaker @entity8 complains to the referee after feeling he was fouled inside the area @entity112 - winning midfielder @entity8 takes a corner during the first half of the @entity116 match then as if to reaffirm his ability to score , he evaded the presence of young @entity5 full - back @entity119 inside the box on the left , before firing a shot into @entity125 ’s near post for @entity24 ’s second			1
it is all well and good @entity1 displaying an enviable work - rate down the wing , one that surely impresses @entity131 , but it ’s more well and good if he is through the middle stretching defences to breaking point			1
against @entity5 , this was not vintage @entity24 and they made hard work of a team fighting relegation , a team they should be sweeping aside			1
it can not be denied that they are finding results , getting wins , but in the biggest match of their season , against @entity148 , they were found lacking			0
as this game drew on , @entity1 displayed a lovely deftness of touch to control the ball with his knee then flick it over an opponent in one fluid motion			0
where was he ? in the middle of the attacking third			0
@entity84 stabs in @entity24 's first goal of the evening against @entity5 at @entity22 @entity161 scored a superb consolation goal late in the game after being given too much room			1

@entity24 beat @entity5 2 - 1 at @entity22 on *wednesday* night
@entity1 played on the wing , @entity8 played no 10
@entity1 's best work came when he was central
the @entity54 forward scored the @entity173 ' second goal of the evening
