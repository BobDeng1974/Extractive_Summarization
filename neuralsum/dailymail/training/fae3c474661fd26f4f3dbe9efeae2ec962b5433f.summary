by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 18 january 2013 @entity1 has been turned against itself in the laboratory in a breakthrough that could permanently quash the virus that leads to @entity5 , say scientists			1
a researcher in @entity8 worked out how to modify a protein in the virus , so that it instead provides strong , lasting protection from the infection			1
' this is like fighting fire with fire , ' @entity12 from the @entity13 , in @entity14 said			1
' if this research continues down its strong path , and bear in mind there are a many hurdles to clear , we ’re looking at a cure for @entity5			1
' @entity1 budding in human lymphatic tissue			1
the breakthrough could keep the virus in a latent state in the body associate professor @entity12 invented the ' @entity32 ' protein by mutating an existing @entity1 protein			1
he said it has shown remarkable abilities to stop the virus replicating in a lab environment			2
animal trials are due to start this year			2
' i have never seen anything like it			0
the modified protein works every time , ' he said			2
' you would still be infected with @entity1 , it ’s not a cure for the virus			1
but the virus would stay latent , it would n’t wake up , so it would n’t develop into @entity5			1
with a treatment like this , you would maintain a healthy immune system			0
' the successful development of this type of one - off treatment would also have economic implications			0
@entity1 patients must take a regime of drugs for the rest of their lives once their immune system is compromised , which can be a significant financial burden			1
indeed , a study released by @entity67 has suggested patients should start taking antiretrovirals as soon as they are diagnosed as this could slow the damage to the immune system			0
the latest research has been published in the current issue of @entity74 and marks three decades of work by @entity12			0
current anti-retroviral medicines suppress the replication of @entity1 by blocking the enzymes @entity1 uses to replicate itself associate professor @entity12 has been researching @entity1 for thirty years , since starting as a research assistant at the @entity80 , @entity81 ( @entity80 ) in the early 1980s when the first cases of @entity5 emerged			1
' i ’ve come close to giving up in the past			0
but today i ’m so encouraged			0
i feel very fortunate because not a lot of scientists are able to stay in the same game long enough to see these sorts of developments			0
it involves perseverance , dedication and , of course , sustained research funding			0
' @entity98 , chief executive of the @entity99 : " the @entity8 study is very interesting and we 'll definitely be monitoring how the research continues			0
' it 's great that these sorts of studies are getting the funding and support they need and that we appear to be getting closer to understanding how @entity1 works , and what might in future become a cure			2
' this is one of a number of promising avenues in cure research , all of which need as appropriate continued discussion , funding and support			0
" there are an estimated 32.2million @entity1 - infected people worldwide			2
the @entity119 estimates that 100,000 live in the @entity120 , with around a quarter unaware they have the infection .			2

*technique* modifies a protein in the virus to that is provides protection from infection
' it is like fighting fire with fire , ' says lead researcher
@entity1 could remain latent in body and not lead to @entity5
