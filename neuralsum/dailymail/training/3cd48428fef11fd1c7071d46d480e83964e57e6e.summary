' if you do n't want to have to wear a suit to make payments , you could just use your veins instead			2
a contactless payment that scans the veins on a shopper 's palm is being trialled in @entity123 more than 1,000 @entity123 shoppers have signed up to make the payments			1
the vein - scanning terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an engineering student at the local university came up with the technology two years ago while waiting in line to pay			0
every person 's vein pattern is completely unique , so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system , the maker claims			0
handy idea ! developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method if it is a success during trials in the city of @entity146 in southern @entity123			0
the plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe .			0
