war of words : @entity4 peer @entity2 said @entity5 should be ousted to ensure they do n't fail badly in 2015 the @entity4 were plunged into turmoil yesterday as @entity9 ’s closest political ally suggested @entity5 should step down to prevent a rout at the next election			1
in a devastating intervention , @entity2 said the party needed to overhaul its policies and leadership in the face of dire opinion poll ratings			2
@entity2 , the party ’s former @entity18 spokesman , said : ‘ we have lost over half our market share – if you like to put it that way , if we had been @entity25 ’s – since the election , and any business that had done that would be looking very hard now at both its strategy and its management to see how we get some of that back because otherwise we are going to lose a large number of seats at the next election			1
’ and in a clear shot at mr @entity5 , he said elections were ‘ not just about the message , they are also about the messenger ’			1
he said many @entity4 found it ‘ difficult ’ to be in a coalition and suggested mr @entity5 had to work harder to drive the party ’s values home			1
he added : ‘ we do have ... very good policies which are popular			0
but on things like the banks , sorting them out , like taxing the wealthy , we have to fight very hard not just to put the message across but to get it implemented in government			2
’ @entity2 was sacked by mr @entity5 after criticising the government ’s failure to tackle bank bonuses			1
but he remains a close ally of the business secretary @entity9 who is emerging as the most likely candidate to replace mr @entity5 if he quits or is forced out before the next election			1
at odds : deputy prime minister @entity5 @entity5 ( left ) has a plan for a new tax on the rich , but it is opposed by chancellor @entity55 ( right ) differences : the @entity58 colleagues have shown a united front in the @entity60 since the coalition government was formed , but they disagree over a new tax for the rich there was no suggestion that @entity2 was acting on behalf of mr @entity9 , and senior @entity4 last night dismissed his intervention as ‘ one man ’s views ’			1
and last night mr @entity5 said : ‘ for as long as i have been in politics you always have back seat drivers who end up making endless comments about people who actually have to lead and make decisions and take responsibility			1
’ but the intervention was another setback for the deputy prime minister whose attempt to relaunch his leadership with plans for a wealth tax have already fallen flat			2
criticism : senior conservatives @entity85 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) have attacked mr @entity5 's proposal @entity2 ’s comments highlight mounting concern within @entity4 ranks about the impact of the @entity92 on the party ’s poll ratings			1
recent polls have put the party on just 10 per cent of the vote – less than the @entity99 @entity98			0
if this level of support does not improve , the party stands to lose 47 of its 57 seats at the next election			0
earlier this summer 69 - year - old @entity9 fuelled speculation about his ambitions by refusing to rule out succeeding mr @entity5 , saying : ‘ i do n’t exclude it – who knows what might happen in the future ? ’ under the @entity4 constitution a leadership contest would be triggered if mr @entity5 chooses to call one or quit			1
otherwise it requires mr @entity5 to lose a vote of confidence among his mps or to face a call to resign from 75 constituency associations			1
many observers believe mr @entity5 will quit before the election – possibly at the party ’s 2014 conference – unless the polls show major improvement			1
@entity9 is five times more popular with voters than his party leader , according to a new poll			0
the @entity130 survey found that the @entity4 business secretary enjoys more support among both @entity4 voters and the wider public			1
asked which of six senior ministers they respected the most , 17 per cent said mr @entity9 , compared to just three per cent for mr @entity5			1
@entity139 topped the poll with 22 per cent , @entity138 scored 12 per cent and the chancellor @entity55 won just one per cent support			0
among @entity4 voters , 51 per cent said they supported mr @entity9 , compared to just 19 per cent for their party ’s leader			2
the findings will encourage those within the party who believe its best chance of survival is to install mr @entity9 as leader before the next election			0
the poll also highlights the sense of betrayal among many former @entity4 voters			2
among those who voted @entity4 in 2010 but say they will not do so again , just one per cent said mr @entity5 was ‘ strong ’ , and just four per cent agreed that he ‘ sticks to what he believes in ’			1
among this group 28 per cent said they respected mr @entity9 , compared to just two per cent for mr @entity5			1
analysis by @entity164 the call by @entity5 for an emergency wealth tax to help pay the nation ’s bills looks like a throwback to the 1970s when then @entity171 chancellor @entity170 threatened to squeeze the rich ‘ until the pips squeak ’			1
instead of raising extra income , @entity170 ’s attacks on the wealthy stifled economic growth and jobs creation and sent capital scurrying overseas			0
it is , of course , deeply frustrating that some of the super-rich , like the comedian @entity182 , seek to avoid paying tax by using complex schemes designed to keep @entity185 ( @entity185 ) at bay			0
but the answer to that problem is to bring in simpler and lower taxes , with fewer loopholes			0
out of sync : @entity5 ¿ s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy the consequence of imposing surcharges or super-taxes on the rich is presently to be seen in @entity198			1
since president @entity199 came to power promising to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent , more than half of @entity198 ’s most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas or shift their money out of the country			2
@entity199 ’s grotesque policy error has become @entity99 ’s gain as many of the @entity198 wealth creators are setting up home in @entity211 as tax exiles taking advantage of the @entity99 @entity215 ’s special scheme for non-domiciles and lower tax bands			0
@entity5 ’s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy			2
all the evidence suggests that the higher the marginal tax rate , the smaller amount of revenue it produces			0
wealth taxes act as a disincentive to work and wealth , and lead the individuals targeted to look for clever ways to avoid paying , move overseas or stop working altogether			0
' grotesque ' : more than half of @entity198 's most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas because of president @entity199 's tax policies the work of professor @entity233 of @entity234 , author of the famous @entity233 curves , demonstrates that if income taxes are slashed the incentives to work become greater and more wealth is created			2
@entity2 ( @entity242 ) @entity241 ’s adoption of this tax - cutting principle as part of the @entity246 economic reforms produced a flood of new income for the exchequer			2
of course it is not @entity5 ’s responsibility to design the nation ’s tax system.in the much - derided march 2012 budget one of the chancellor ’s biggest reforms , to be implemented next april , was to cut the 50 per cent emergency rate of income tax – imposed by @entity171 before it left office – to 45 per cent			2
@entity171 has sought to portray this decision as a tax break for millionaires			0
the reality is that studies , carried out by the @entity18 , show that above 45 per cent people resent paying their taxes , seek to avoid or try to persuade their employers ( if they work for big companies ) to move them overseas			0
the result is a loss of tax revenue rather than a gain			0
moreover , because the 50 per cent rate is levied on a @entity276 basis , and is deducted directly from pay packets , it largely hits senior management both in the private and public sector rather than the super-rich			0
senior managers are also the principal victims of the removal of personal tax allowances for those earning over £ 100,000 , capital gains tax , inheritance tax and high rates of stamp duty on their homes			0
@entity55 is already seeking to capture extra income from high - wealth individuals by abolishing the loopholes that allow ownership of some of the most expensive homes in @entity99 to be shifted offshore out of the range of @entity185			0
closing these loopholes has become a priority and is a much more efficient way of ensuring that the real millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share .			0

@entity2 warns elections are ' not just about the message , they are also about the messenger '
the @entity4 have lost half their support in two years
this requires a review of ' strategy and management ' , the peer said
meanwhile mr @entity5 's plan for a new tax on the rich appears to be in tatters
