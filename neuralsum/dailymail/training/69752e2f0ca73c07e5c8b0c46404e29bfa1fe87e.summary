scientists have managed to ' reset ' human stem cells in a move which could lead to the development of cures for heart and eye diseases , @entity8 's and stroke victims			1
in ' a major step forward ' , @entity11 and @entity12 scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 to 10 - day old embryo , before it implants in the womb			1
by studying the reset cells , they said they hoped they would now be able to learn more about embryo development , and how it can go wrong and cause miscarriage and developmental disorders			1
scientists have managed to ' reset ' human stem cells in a move which could lead to the development of cures for heart and eye diseases , @entity8 's and stroke victims ' these cells may represent the real starting point for formation of tissues in the human embryo , ' said @entity35 , director of the @entity11 's @entity36 , who co-led the research published in the journal @entity40 on thursday			1
' we hope that in time they will allow us to unlock the fundamental biology of early development , which is impossible to study directly in people , ' he added			0
human pluripotent stem cells , which have the potential to become any of the cells and tissues in the body , can already be made in a lab either from cells extracted from early - stage embryos or from adult cells that have been induced , or reprogrammed , into an earlier state			1
but , the researchers said , until now it has proved difficult to generate human pluripotent stem cells that are at an early enough , pristine stage , before they have started changing			2
instead , scientists have only derived cells that are slightly further down the developmental pathway , not a totally ' blank slate ' , said @entity35			0
experts say that by helping to regenerate tissue , stem cell science could offer new ways of treating conditions for which there are currently no cures - including heart and eye diseases , @entity8 's and stroke			1
the process of generating stem cells in the lab is much easier to control in mouse cells , which can be frozen in a state of very early pluripotency using a protein called @entity80			2
human cells are not as responsive to @entity80 , so they must be controlled in a different way that involves switching key genes on and off			0
in ' a major step forward ' , @entity11 and @entity12 scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 to 10 - day old embryo , before it implants in the womb @entity35 said this was the main reason why scientists have been unable to generate human pluripotent cells that are as primitive and pristine as their mouse equivalents			1
to avoid this problem , the scientists introduced two genes - @entity95 and @entity96 - which caused a network of genes controlling the cell to reboot and induce the early pluripotent state			0
@entity101 of the @entity102 , who worked with @entity35 , said the reset cells opened the door to a new phase of research			2
' we now need to carry out further studies to establish how our cells compare with others , ' he said			0
' we do n't yet know whether these will be a better starting point than existing stem cells for therapies , but being able to start entirely from scratch could prove beneficial			0
' @entity116 , a stem cell expert and professor of regenerative medicine at @entity120 who was not involved in this work , praised its results and implications			0
' having a source of pristine stem cells which can be precisely changed into clinical - relevant cell types is a major step forward , ' he said in an emailed comment			2
' the benefits could be safer and more clinically effective cell therapies produced at lower cost - good news for patients and healthcare providers			0

@entity11 and @entity12 scientists said they had successfully rebooted stem cells so they were equivalent to those of a 7 to 10 - day old embryo
by studying the reset cells , they said they hoped they would now be able to learn more about embryo development , and how it can go wrong
it is hoped the research could lead to cures for a host of conditions such as heart and eye disease , @entity8 's and stroke victims
