@entity6 is one of the more experienced dancers but has decided that she wants to try and get a normal job before she gets too old business : one of the girls at @entity39 swings into action as a punter - banned from touching - looks on the @entity78 ex-gymnast began exotic dancing as a last resort : ' i used to think i would never do something like that , but i could n't get a job , at all , anywhere			1
