@entity0 attempted to boost his prime ministerial credentials yesterday when he met @entity2 at the @entity3 – albeit for just 25 minutes			2
in the high - stakes meeting , known as a ‘ brush - by ’ , the two men discussed the situations in @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity11 referendum and the cost of living crisis , said @entity14 officials			1
a chat and all - important photo - opportunity with the @entity18 president is seen as electoral gold dust for a @entity21 opposition leader			1
meeting : @entity0 was officially in @entity22 to meet national security adviser @entity24 but @entity2 dropped in for what is known as a ' brush by ' @entity14 officials were reportedly terrified of a repeat performance of @entity29 ’s hapless attempts to get together with mr @entity2 in 2009			1
after five unsuccessful requests , mr @entity29 had to make do with a humiliating five - minute chat in the kitchens of the @entity34 headquarters			1
fearing failure again , party officials kept the @entity0 visit secret until after he arrived in @entity22 on sunday			1
there had been worries mr @entity0 would also be shoved off the presidential agenda by more pressing world events and his rejection of military intervention in @entity44 last year			0
however , the meeting may have been helped by the presence of several @entity48 aides on the @entity14 election team			1
mr @entity0 missed the chance to respond to an urgent statement in the @entity52 on action against @entity54 following the crash of @entity56 for the trip , which was kept secret and only confirmed by his office after he arrived in the @entity18			0
he said in an interview on arrival that he wanted to be prime minister next year , and felt it was important to discuss ‘ the many pressing issues our country faces ’ with the @entity18 ‘ whether you think about trade and jobs or terrorism and climate change , we ’ve got to work with the @entity18 ’ , he told @entity67			0
‘ as somebody who wants to be the prime minister in less than 10 months ’ time , it ’s important i ’m here talking to key figures in the administration about the many pressing issued that our country faces and indeed the world faces ’			2
he denied his scuppering of military strikes on @entity44 , in a dramatic vote a year ago , had cooled relations with the @entity18 , as claimed last week by a former presidential adviser			0
as to whether he had pleaded for a meeting with the president , he said : ‘ no , this is about saying that i ’m determined to engage with the @entity18 at all levels of the administration			1
’ he also revealed he had not seen his brother @entity91 – who he challenged for the @entity93 leadership – and now lives in @entity94 who he said was on holiday with his family ‘ some distance ’ away			0
mr @entity0 and president @entity2 met at @entity99 in may 2011 , when he warned @entity14 can only win the next election if he embraces a more optimistic vision for @entity21 's future @entity103 ( left ) , a former spin doctor to @entity29 , insisted the @entity14 leader was wasting his time talks between an opposition leader and the @entity18 president can be a high - stakes affair which has been described as a ‘ job interview for being prime minister ’			1
mr @entity0 – who met @entity2 in @entity112 last year – was anxious to avert the disaster suffered by @entity29 in september 2009			0
the then prime minister was snubbed five times by mr @entity2 when they both attended a @entity34 summit in @entity94 , and they eventually held a bizarre meeting in a @entity34 kitchen			2
@entity121 ’s meeting with @entity122 just before the 1987 election turned to disaster when the president then went public with deep concerns about his views on nuclear disarmament			1
mr @entity0 also gave a speech to the @entity130 think tank in @entity22 , calling for sanctions against @entity54 to be tightened			1
several former @entity14 insiders said he had ‘ wasted time ’ trying to win cheap political kudos			0
former @entity14 spin doctor @entity103 warned that the ‘ charade ’ served nobody ’s purposes and mr @entity0 later told @entity67 that he had not ‘ pleaded ’ for a meeting with mr @entity2			2
and with poor timing for mr @entity0 , @entity141 yesterday blasted the @entity143 ’s anti-business agenda – and warned his enthusiasm for state control was at odds with public opinion			0
@entity29 was snubbed by president @entity2 five times in 2009 before being granted a chat while walking through a kitchen at the @entity34 the former prime minister suggested mr @entity0 had learned the wrong lessons from the financial crash and suggested he should tone down his anti-bank rhetoric			2
in a warning to mr @entity0 , who has embraced some @entity14 principles such as price controls and nationalisation , he said : ‘ old ideas in new clothing are still old ideas – and are visibly so when undressed by reality			0
’ he told the @entity161 that the @entity14 leadership was wrong to think the public has ‘ fallen back in love with the state ’ .			0
