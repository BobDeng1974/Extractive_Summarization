by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 9 august 2013 a new business is being launched for people around the globe who want to travel - albeit virtually - into space			1
students @entity6 and @entity8 from @entity9 are launching low - cost space missions , taking light - weight payloads including people 's photographs , billboard - style adverts and even cakes soaring into the stratosphere for a fraction of the cost of @entity20 and @entity21 flights			1
the prototype balloon costs just £ 350 and is fitted with a camera that can beam back images of the @entity26 's stratosphere			1
a 1.5kg capsule is attached to a helium balloon , pictured , and is capable of reaching altitudes of 23 miles			1
it can carry photos of people or adverts and a built - in camera can takes images high above the @entity26 the capsules weigh just over 1.5kg and is about the size of a lunchbox			1
a helium balloon carries the capsule into the stratosphere reaching an altitude of as much as 37.6km			1
gps coordinates are sent to the user 's mobile phone and cameras can be remotely taken before the balloon deflates and the craft descends with a parachute			0
a memory card on board the balloon - assisted spacecraft for the @entity28 campaign recently carried the names of more than 2,000 @entity28 students , prospective students , alumni and academics			1
the students have fine - tuned their design to allow space enthusiasts to send their own messages into orbit and capture their own images for the same bargain price			2
@entity6 , 28 , and @entity70 , 27 , sent up their first homemade device in 2011 with a styrofoam box containing a cheap camera lifted by a helium balloon			1
they tracked its progress on a gps device , which responded to a phone call by texting back its coordinates			0
so far the balloon has reached altitudes of more than 23 miles ( 37km ) which is twice the height of the so - called @entity85 limit - an altitude beyond which humans ca n't survive in an unpressurized environment			1
' it ’s a hobby that has really caught the imagination , ' said @entity6			0
' the space shuttle programme cost $ 200 billion , so getting our spacecraft to 37km for 350 quid feels amazing and quite a bargain			0
' manned missions are not currently on the agenda but the team are learning quickly and breaking altitude records each time they send a capsule up			0
the team meet regularly to fine - tune the equipment at @entity6 's @entity9 home , dubbed @entity103			1
these pictures were taken by @entity9 graduates @entity8 and @entity6 using a camera fitted to their space balloon			1
the capsule has already reached altitudes of 23 miles and the pair are hoping to reach higher the capsules weigh just over 1.5kg , are about the size of a lunchbox , and rise into the stratosphere reaching an altitude of as much as 37.6 kilometres before the balloon deflates and the craft descends with a parachute			1
a memory card on board the balloon - assisted spacecraft for the @entity28 campaign recently carried the names of more than 2,000 @entity28 students , prospective students , alumni and academics			2
the students have fine - tuned their design to allow space enthusiasts to send their own messages into orbit and capture their own images for the same bargain price			2
@entity8 said : “ we are providing the kit for non-specialists for their own space mission			2
@entity6 , left , and @entity70 sent up their first homemade device in 2011 with a styrofoam box containing a cheap camera lifted by a helium balloon			1
they tracked its progress on a gps device , which responded to a phone call by texting back its coordinates ' the set - up is very intuitive and easy to understand			0
we sent a cake into space to celebrate a web design company ’s tenth anniversary , so anything can be attached to the aircraft if it is light enough			0
' the highest we have reached so far is 23 miles , but with technology advancing we are hoping to get higher and higher as time goes on			2
' @entity160 gets off the ground at the start of october with the standard kit costing £ 350 and users can install their own video camera			0
customers can send anything such as messages to loved ones and advertising campaigns			0
@entity8 added : ' the sky is the limit for us when we launch in october and we hope our business takes off			2
' people will be able to buy starter kits to send their own messages and photos from @entity179 in october			0
the standard kit costs £ 350 and users can install their own video camera the students have now turned their attention to a campaign for the @entity28 called ' @entity184 ' aimed at attracting students to upgrade to a place at @entity9 during this year ’s clearing process			0
' @entity188 has seen more than its share of high fliers ' , continued @entity6 , ' including astronauts , @entity193 pilots and more , so it ’s fitting for us to be launching a campaign that ’s all about reaching for the stars			0
' @entity70 said : ' we might not be in a position to rival @entity20 or @entity21 yet , but we hope it ’s just a matter of time			0
' when you look at the cost of a @entity21 ticket ( $ 250,000 ) and compare it with cost of sending a picture of your dad who ’s always wanted to go into space up with us , there ’s a good case for flying with us			0

@entity6 and @entity8 are launching low - cost ' space missions '
their capsules are carried 23 miles into space attached to a helium balloon
it can carry people 's photographs , names and even adverts
built - in camera takes photos of the mission and sends the images to @entity26
