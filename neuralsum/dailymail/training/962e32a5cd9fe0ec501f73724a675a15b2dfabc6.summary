there is an abuse of power			0

she immediately turned herself in and sought asylum			0
while here illegally , she married @entity65 , who was born in @entity66 but moved here 40 years ago , and the couple had three kids , @entity40 , 11 , @entity69 , 6 and @entity43 4 , all @entity9 citizens			1
@entity10 is the sole carer of her elderly mother - in - law , another @entity9 citizen , whose toes were amputated and needs help eating , walking and washing			1
but her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her testimony about fearing the prostitution trade lacked credibility			0

' packing up : @entity10 , pictured center with her kids , chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags , waiting for authorities but they did n't come seeking asylum : @entity10 came to the @entity9 through @entity59 in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in @entity17 she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution			1

in fact , she 's a glowing member of her community , described by friends and her children 's teachers as a hard - working mother who pays her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork , not to mention keeping her elderly mother - in - law out of a government - funded home			1
' @entity1 has gone off the map here , ' @entity44 said			2

but the mother - of - three was convinced @entity145 would n't deport a woman whose three kids are @entity9 - born			1
' that is strange they put an ankle bracelet on a mom with three kids , ' @entity44 said , referring to the low risk of her fleeing			0
' then the day before her scheduled flight they said " you 're flying out tomorrow , here 's your information			1
" they did n't want the bad press			0
' i think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they understood how egregious this case is			0
it just does n't make sense			0
' now , the authorities will be forced to collect @entity10 from her home and take her into custody			2
at midday tuesday , she was pictured there , with her family surrounding her awaiting @entity145 officers			0
@entity10 and her children were crying as they hugged by the christmas tree , and the woman 's mother - in - law was asking what would become of her if her daughter was sent home			1

hugs : @entity10 has not decided , if she is in fact deported , whether to take the kids , who have never been to @entity17 , with her review : the mother 's case will be reviewed ' they will jail her for one to three weeks , however long it takes to organize another flight , ' @entity44 told @entity50			1
' then border guards will drive her to the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she 's a mass murderer or a terrorist going to @entity206			0
' in the meantime , @entity44 and the family are working desperately for someone in @entity210 to interject			2
' we need somebody in the @entity213 , connected to @entity145 , to say " stop this immediately			0
" if someone in @entity210 hears about this , that is our best chance			0
her story just has n't been heard			0
' understandably , @entity10 is beside herself , and is still trying to work out if she will take her children , who are enrolled in school and have never been to @entity17 , with her			1

' she is crying all the time , trying to work out who she can take and who she ca n't			2
she 's going back to @entity17 and that is not a good place to bring a 6 - year - old girl , particularly			2
