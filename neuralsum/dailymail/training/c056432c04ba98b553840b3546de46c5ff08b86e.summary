the former bodyguard for princess @entity1 has hit out against a new play suggesting that prince @entity4 's real father is @entity5 - but says that the prince will not care about the speculation			1
the @entity9 production , believed to be endorsed by mr @entity5 himself , has drawn criticism for its support of the rumours surrounding @entity4 's paternity , as well as a claim that @entity1 was pregnant at the time of her death			1
the princess ' ex-minder , @entity18 , has described the play @entity21 , @entity1 as ' tasteless ' , adding that there is no evidence to back up the allegations made by the production , which opened in @entity25 last friday			1
claims : a new play suggests that @entity4 , left , is the son of former cavalry officer @entity5 , right affair : the production claims princess @entity1 began a relationship with @entity5 18 months before @entity4 's birth however , he said that @entity4 ' wo n't give a monkeys ' about the repetition of claims that former cavalry officer @entity5 is his real father			1
' @entity5 , actually , prior to this play has gone on record to say @entity4 is n't his son , ' mr @entity18 told the @entity40			1
' @entity4 knows exactly who he is and he 's heard all this before			0
' he wo n't give a monkeys about the play and wo n't see it			0
he will laugh it all off			0
' rubbished : bodyguard @entity18 says that prince @entity4 will not be concerned by the fresh speculation the play , which was written by @entity48 and is currently on at the @entity49 , claims that @entity5 and @entity1 began seeing each other 18 months before the princess ' second son was born in 1984			1
in one scene , the actor playing @entity5 says : ' @entity1 and i started our relationship more than a year before @entity4 was born			1
now that does n't prove that i am his father			0
it 's just the inconvenient truth			0
' @entity5 has previously insisted that his affair with @entity1 started in 1986 - but he is friends with mr @entity48 , and when asked about the play said he is ' sure that it is accurate '			1
the production also uses a notorious photograph of @entity4 naked in a @entity66 hotel room taken in 2012 - comparing it with a nude picture of @entity5 to reinforce the link between the two men			2
mr @entity18 - who guarded @entity1 for seven years and later wrote a controversial memoir - told the mirror : ' @entity5 was captured naked , then 20 - odd years later they tried to tie it up with prince @entity4 in a hotel room in @entity66			1
' what 's the connection ? well there is no connection			0
it 's totally tasteless , it has no relevance to this play at all			0
' mr @entity48 told the @entity81 last year that he had spoken to @entity5 while researching the play , adding : ' i met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain , particularly about when his relationship with @entity1 started			2
' there is a startling revelation that @entity5 makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play			2
this is the fact that his relationship with @entity1 started 18 months before prince @entity4 was born			1
' guard : mr @entity18 is shown with @entity1 and her two sons as they left a restaurant together in april 1993 allegation : the play also claims that @entity1 was pregnant with the baby of her lover @entity97 , pictured with the princess on the night of their death theories : the new play is currently on at the @entity49 in @entity25 's @entity9 he continued : ' we are not saying he is prince @entity4 's father although the audience may take their own view on that			1
i do nâ€™t know if @entity5 is prince @entity4 's father and @entity5 has always denied it either because it is n't true or out of some sense of loyalty			2
' another extraordinary claim aired in @entity116 , lies , @entity1 concerns the rumour that the princess was pregnant by her lover @entity97 at the time of the couple 's death in a @entity123 car crash in 1997			2
a post-mortem examination showed that this was not the case - but in the play , a witness describes hearing one doctor being told that @entity1 had lost a baby in the crash which claimed her life			0
a scene shows the doctor on the phone saying , ' what ? she was pregnant ? ' - then telling another character : ' @entity139 of @entity140 's mother , pregnant with a @entity142 baby			0
' royal experts have rubbished the explosive claims made by the play , pointing out that there is no evidence to support them			2
biographer @entity149 told the @entity81 last year : ' i have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that @entity5 was n't in the picture before 1986			0
' and author @entity154 added : ' if you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle			0
they have an agenda of their own			0

@entity164 , @entity1 is believed to be backed by @entity5
it shows the cavalry officer claiming he started his affair with princess @entity1 18 months before @entity4 was born
ex-minder @entity18 says the prince will *ignore* ' tasteless ' speculation
play also suggests that @entity1 was pregnant at the time of her death
