he was diagnosed with the rare and aggressive cancer called @entity33 , which affects around than 50 children a year , in october 2010			1
since then @entity7 has been determined to remain active but his current replacement limb is heavy and slows him down , so his parents @entity14 and @entity37 decided to try to raise the cash to buy him a lighter model from the @entity40			1
but @entity42 winners @entity19 and @entity20 from @entity43 - who scooped £ 161 million in a draw a year ago - heard about @entity7 's battle and stepped in with a five - figure donation to buy the new leg outright			1
and @entity7 is said to have ' screamed with delight ' at the life - changing news and will have his leg within six weeks			2
the unexpected donation came after the grandmother of @entity7 ’s school friend , who lives in the same village as the @entity55 , contacted them to ask if they could help			2
