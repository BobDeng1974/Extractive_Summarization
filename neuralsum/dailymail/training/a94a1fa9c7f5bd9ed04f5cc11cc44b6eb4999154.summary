by @entity0 @entity1 admits he ’s stunned to be the only @entity2 in the @entity4 group stages this season after his shock inclusion in the @entity8 squad			1
the former @entity10 starlet has been named in the @entity12 giants ’ a squad list for this season ’s @entity15 campaign , despite only playing for their b team so far since his summer move from @entity20			1
and , incredibly , with @entity21 already out of the tournament and @entity24 ’s @entity23 having not even qualified , it means the 18 - year - old attacking midfielder dubbed @entity26 during his emergence in @entity28 is set to be this country ’s sole represenative on the biggest club stage of all			1
on the ball : @entity1 ( right ) in action for @entity35 under 21s against @entity37 learning curve : @entity1 ( right ) chats to @entity8 team - mate @entity39 having arrived at the @entity12 club from @entity10 earlier this summer @entity1 celebrated the news with his first goals at under 21 level when his double helped @entity46 ’s side end their @entity48 campaign on a high with a 3 - 0 win in @entity37 - following on from last week ’s 1 - 1 draw away to group winners @entity50			1
but he was clearly still shocked to have been presented with even a remote chance by @entity8 of making an appearance against @entity54 ’s @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity21 ’s conquerors @entity56 in @entity58 of this season ’s @entity15 club spectacular			1
@entity1 , who signed a six - year contract with the @entity12 giants in the summer for a fee thought to be in the region of £ 3million , with a buy - out clause of £ 47.8million eye - catchingly inserted , said of his inclusion in the @entity8 squad : ‘ i heard about it through @entity69 , actually			1
it ’s great to be in the squad and hopefully at some point i can maybe even be a part of it in games			2
‘ i was actually quite surprised because i ’ve been playing with the b team			2
@entity78 have got a lot of depth and strength in the team so when the news did come out i was quite surprised			2
‘ there was no indication from the manager @entity85 because i think the draw was just a couple of days before i came back so there was n’t too much said about it			0
they were just going about it week by week so i ’m just delighted with being named in the squad and i ’m looking forward to it			2
finishing school : @entity1 fires home his second goal for @entity35 celebration time : the playmaker dubbed ' @entity26 ' is congratulated by team - mate @entity97 ‘ i can only keep doing my best and keep doing what i try and do best and keep plugging away to make sure i am in his thoughts			1
‘ to be involved in any way would be a great experience and something i would remember for a long time			0
‘ but at the same time i ’m not expecting anything			0
i ’m keeping things realistic and i ’m not hoping for too much , too soon			0
‘ there have been a lot of new experiences just in the couple of months or so that i ’ve been there - and there have been a lot of challenges as well			2
‘ i ’m sure there will be more to come and i can only look forward to it			0
’ now @entity1 - who was mobbed by @entity8 autograph hunters after the game in @entity37 - has to deal with the really difficult bit - getting tickets for the @entity4 matches for his mates			1
he admitted : ‘ i ’ve already had a couple of requests ! i ’m sure i ’ll hear from a few more of my friends before the games			0
‘ i ’ve also had a few texts congratulating me and it comes up in conversation because i keep in touch with them all			0
it ’s nice for me			0
’ @entity1 believes his experiences in @entity12 have already helped him improve his game since his summer move from @entity20			1
marked man : @entity1 emerged as a promising youngster at @entity10 in 2012 rising star : @entity1 is regarded as a big prospect for @entity35 he said : ‘ the tempo of games in @entity12 is closer to international games			1
when you play in the @entity142 and you go away and play in an international game it ’s hard to adapt to it really quickly because the speed of the game is much quicker at international level , that ’s the main difference			0
‘ being in @entity12 is making me adapt to that more easily at international level as well			2
’ @entity1 has already been tipped by many observers for a call - up to @entity154 ’s side , but is just concentrating on the next campaign for @entity46 ’s @entity156			1
and he ’s optimistic about the future for the young @entity158			0
he said : ‘ we ’ve played a really young team in both games this last week and that ’s promising as we look to the next campaign			2
‘ @entity50 are a really good outfit and we did very well against them , although obviously conceding in the last minute put us on a bit of a downer			0
‘ @entity37 can make life really difficult for teams - @entity168 only won here on the back of a penalty - so we can be happy with ourselves scoring three goals and keeping a clean sheet			1
‘ everyone obviously gets on very well together and that helps and you are building personal relationships that help on the pitch as well			0
everything is looking good towards the next campaign			0
