@entity1 winner @entity0 has criticised the @entity3 team for airing ' dirty laundry in public ' after their defeat at @entity8 last month			1
in the immediate wake of @entity12 's 16 1/2 to 11 1/2 victory , @entity3 veteran @entity9 openly criticised the captaincy of @entity14 , sat a few feet away from him , at the post-tournament press conference			1
that has led to a fortnight of apologies , inquests and soul - searching about what can be done to end the @entity12 dominance of the event			1
the @entity3 team were convincingly beaten by @entity12 in the @entity25 ' i think it 's a little bit disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public , ' said @entity0 , back on @entity3 soil playing in the @entity33 's @entity32 in @entity34 this week			1
' it 's very difficult to pin - point in a team environment whose fault it specifically is			1
' it 's a combination of a lot of different things			0
maybe @entity14 got a few things wrong			1
maybe the @entity3 team just did n't quite play well enough in general			1
you know , if the other team plays well , you 're going to lose			0
' i 'm just pleased that i do n't have to sort it all out because i do n't like to see people 's great reputations being brought down by something that should n't really happen in public			0
@entity3 captain @entity14 ( right ) has taken full responsibility for any mistakes made in the @entity1 defeat ' it should all be done behind closed doors and sorted out there , and the analysis should start there , really , and not be done in the press , in the media			1
' @entity0 was part of the team which lost at @entity67 in 2008 and while there were a number of issues with @entity72 's captaincy then no - one in the @entity12 team broke ranks with their frustrations			1
' i think there were a lot of people disappointed in ' 08 but we tried to come together and basically not say anything in public , ' added @entity0 at his pre-tournament press conference			1
' whenever you lose you 're going to be disappointed and you 're going to think things could have been done better			0
@entity9 , speaking in a press conference after @entity12 has secured victory at @entity8 , claimed @entity3 captain @entity14 had ' strayed from a winning formula ' and compared his unfavourably to 2008 leader @entity89			1
he said : ' there were two things that allowed us to play our best that @entity89 did			0
' first , he got everybody invested in the process			0
he got everybody invested in who they were going to play with , who the picks were going to be , who was going to be in their ' pod ' , when they would play , and they had a great leader for each pod			0
' the other things that @entity89 did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this , how we were going to go about playing together , if so - and - so is playing well , if so - and - so is not playing well			0
' those two things helped us bring out our best golf			0
we use that same process in the @entity112 and we do really well			0
' unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three @entity114 and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			0
' asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to @entity14 , he replied : ' i 'm sorry you 're taking it that way			1
i 'm just talking about what @entity89 did to help us play our best			0
' @entity9 was clear and specific in his criticism of @entity3 @entity1 captain @entity14 @entity9 ( centre ) looks despondent after @entity12 collect the @entity1 trophy instead of @entity3 ' it 's just a case of managing it and handling it and improving it for the next time professionally			1
' certainly for the future @entity114 the @entity12 will remember how it 's all been handled			1
' the @entity12 team will remember the fall - out from this one			1
it ca n't do anything but build confidence for the @entity12 team going into the next one that it 's been handled so publicly this time			1
' i guess we 'll see how easy it is to get the @entity3 team rattled by putting a bit of pressure on them			1
i do n't think anything good can come of all this ( for the @entity3 )			2
' in response to all of the recent discussion about our @entity1 loss , i would like to make a few comments			2
first , i take complete and full responsibility for my communication , and i regret that my words may have made the players feel that i did n't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the @entity1			2
my intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be @entity163 , the guys gave @entity164 played their hearts out			0
i was proud to get to know each and every one of them			0
i know they are all going to win tournaments , be on future @entity1 teams and have wonderful careers			2
our team certainly showed guts when it took it to the other team early in sunday 's singles matches			0
we were indeed tied with them as the scoreboard turned wonderfully " red "			0
our players started fast as i had asked them to in my comments the night before			0
i asked them to really concentrate on holes 2 - 5 , as the @entity12 had won too many early battles on these particular holes			1
but in the end , the facts are that the other team played better			0
my hat 's off and congratulations to them			0
as for @entity9 's comments , i completely understand his reaction in the moment			2
earlier this week i had an open and candid conversation with him and it ended with a better understanding of each other 's perspectives			0
@entity9 's heart and intentions for our team 's success have always been in the right place			1
@entity9 is a great player , has great passion and i admire what he 's done for golf			2
the bottom line is this			0
in hindsight whatever mistakes that were made were mine			0
and i take complete and full responsibility for them			0
i want to say again to the players , their families , the @entity33 and our country how proud and honored i was to captain this talented group of golfers , and how privileged i was to spend the past two years working this labor of my love for the @entity1			1
@entity222 , a member of the losing team at @entity8 , said he had avoided everything to do with defeat since returning home			1
' i played the @entity1 and then have n't turned on the tv since i was home			2
i 've watched some football games and some baseball games , but i do n't look online to see anything , ' he said			0
' @entity9 answered a question			2
it did n't seem like it was at all a shot at @entity14 to me			2
' @entity9 was asked the last time the @entity3 won they had a pod system under @entity89 , ' why do you think they went away from the system , did you prefer the system ? ' and @entity9 said ' yeah '			1
' with that i guess it opened up a can of worms but you 've got to remember @entity9 being asked a second question , and he said ' listen , do n't take it that way			2
this is not a shot at @entity14 ' , so i 'm sure it 's blown out of proportion			2
' @entity0 took to @entity251 to show off his lift home after celebrating winning the @entity25 @entity12 celebrate their @entity1 triumph over @entity3 which came to an end after singles matches on sunday			1
