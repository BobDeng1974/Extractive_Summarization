radiation from an earthquake may be responsible for the mysterious @entity4 image many believe to be a depiction of @entity6 , scientists claim			1
an @entity8 team at the @entity9 , a well respected @entity10 , claims the powerful magnitude 8.2 earthquake , which occurred in @entity13 in the year 33 ad , would have been strong enough to release neutron particles from crushed rock			1
the flood of neutrons may have imprinted an x-ray - like image onto the linen burial cloth by reacting with nitrogen nuclei , say the researchers			1
according to scientists from @entity9 , radiation emissions caused by an earthquake may have confused carbon dating tests conducted in 1988 which suggested the cloth was only 728 years old , and therefore likely to be a forgery			1
the first , hotly debated , documented reference to the @entity4 dates back to the 14th century when a @entity31 knight was said to have had possession of the cloth in the city of @entity35			1
records suggest the @entity4 changed hands many times until 1578 , when it ended up in its current home , the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity8			0
the 14 - foot long herringbone woven cloth appears to show the faint imprint of a man bearing wounds consistent with crucifixion			1
in 1898 , a lawyer named @entity49 took the first known photograph of the cloth			1
his negative revealed new details , including striking facial features that were hidden to the naked eye			0
in addition , the radiation emissions would have increased the level of carbon - 14 isotopes - atomic strains of carbon - in the @entity4			1
according to the scientists , this may well have confused carbon dating tests conducted in 1988 which suggested the cloth was only 728 years old , and therefore likely to be a forgery			1
' we believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the @entity4 's linen fibres , through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei , and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating , ' said professor @entity75 , from the @entity9			1
the new theory is published in the journal @entity78			0
other scientists have previously suggested that neutron radiation may have been responsible for the ghostly image of a crucified man with his arms crossed			1
however , no plausible explanation has been offered for the source of the radiation			0
some have proposed that it came from the body itself , or was generated by an event inside the tomb , pointing to a divine origin linked to the resurrection			0
neutron radiation is usually generated by nuclear fusion or fission , and may be produced by nuclear reactors or particle accelerators			0
prof @entity75 's team believes earthquake - induced high pressure waves in the @entity104 's crust may be an overlooked natural source			2
the face of @entity6 ? other scientists have previously suggested that neutron radiation may have been responsible for the ghostly image of a crucified man with his arms crossed			1
however , no plausible explanation has been offered for the source of the radiation until now			0
the scientists base the idea on research into piezonuclear fission reactions which occur when brittle rock is crushed under enormous pressure			0
during the process , neutron particles are released from atoms			0
a powerful earthquake could achieve the same effect , generating neutron radiation from stresses in the @entity104 , it is claimed			2
@entity128 , a leading expert on the @entity4 and president of the @entity130 , is currently petitioning @entity131 to allow molecular analysis of the cloth using the latest technology			2
it is hoped that such an investigation will be able to confirm or rule out the radiation theory			0

magnitude 8.2 earthquake occurred in @entity13 in 33 ad
flood of neutrons could have confused carbon dating which recently found *shroud* is just 728 years old
may have been responsible for imprinting ' x-ray ' image onto the cloth
