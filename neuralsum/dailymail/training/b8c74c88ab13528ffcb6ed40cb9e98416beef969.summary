by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 17 april 2013 it was a day when old friends reunited and bitter enemies were urged to put aside their battles			0
but there were probably few attending @entity7 's funeral who found this request more difficult than @entity10 and @entity11			2
the two have had a notoriously tricky relationship in private - and often in public - for much of the past 15 years , and their rare meetings are still fraught with tension			1
but when they met at @entity17 today the pair managed to greet each other with impeccable grace , as @entity11 placed his hand on her arm and leaned in to kiss his arch - rival 's wife on the cheek			1
@entity11 and @entity10 buried the hatchett today to greet each other and sit next to each other at the funeral of @entity7 in @entity17 @entity30 leaders and their wives at the funeral of @entity7 today , from left , @entity34 , @entity11 , @entity10 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 @entity35 greets @entity38 , the wife of prime minister @entity39 , at today 's funeral mr @entity11 and mrs @entity10 's spat stretches back more than a decade			1
in her candid autobiography @entity43 , released in 2008 , @entity10 accused @entity11 , then chancellor , of trying to drive her husband @entity35 out of @entity45 since as far back as april 2004 , and it was publicly known that she did n't want him to succeed her husband			1
@entity10 claimed then that @entity11 had been ' rattling the keys ' above @entity35 's head , but that even as mr @entity35 considered stepping down , mr @entity11 refused to back his plans on city academies , foundation hospitals and pension reforms			1
she added : ' @entity35 would have stood down , there is no question			2
instead of which @entity35 felt he had no option but to stay on and fight for the things he believed in			0
when @entity11 then took the stage at @entity61 's 2006 annual conference in @entity62 to claim he felt privileged to have worked with @entity35 , the premier 's wife @entity10 was reputedly overheard saying ' well , that 's a lie ' , by @entity66 , a tv producer with the @entity68 news agency @entity67			1
both @entity69 and mrs @entity10 denied the story , with @entity10 telling reporters : ' honestly , guys , i hate to spoil your story , but i did n't say it and i do n't believe it either			0
' but the incident caused further rifts in an already fragile relationship between the @entity81 and the @entity82			0
the @entity30 politicians and their wives sit in the front row of the congregation at the cathedral for the funeral of @entity7 this morning @entity11 and @entity35 in the front row of the congregation today , left , and @entity35 and @entity10 leaving the cathedral after the service but in a publicity interview for her book , mrs @entity10 said : ' the problem between @entity11 and me is not anything personal			1
it is because i thought my husband was the best person for the job and it 's a damn difficult job			0
as far as @entity11 's impatience about [ @entity101 ] moving on was a difficulty , i thought it was a difficulty @entity35 could do without			2
' so i was just terribly partisan for @entity101 , and i 'm sure @entity34 is partisan for @entity11 and so she should be			0
and the good thing is @entity11 is not alone in @entity45			0
he has @entity34 and has the children , so even in these darkest moments he knows there is something important outside politics for him			0
' @entity10 went on to strain things further , belittling @entity11 somewhat by claiming that her husband had given him pointers on how to win the election			2
@entity11 and his wife @entity34 make their way into the cathedral before @entity7 's funeral today @entity11 , then chancellor , greets @entity10 at the @entity119 in @entity120 , september 2004 , when their feud began			1

@entity11 and the wife of @entity35 sat beside each other in @entity17
have had notoriously tricky relationship since 2004 , when @entity10 's husband @entity35 was prime minister
@entity10 was was *convinced* @entity11 , then chancellor , was trying to usurp her husband as prime minister
