by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 4 october 2013 a fashionable young woman in socks , platform sandals and a mini-skirt tosses a waterfall of straight dark hair over her shoulder and eyes up an £ 850 golden handbag in the shape of an apple , sitting alone in a perspex cabinet			2
nearby , a middle - aged woman with a bored , silent husband , stares at a £ 2,000 @entity16 handbag , intermittently snapping pictures of the object of her desire on her @entity20			0
the distinctive strains of @entity23 chatter fill the air as an immaculate woman clad all in black wafts past in a cloud of scent , trying to convince a young couple of the merits of the latest designer perfume			0
bling rush : hordes of @entity35 shoppers are to flock to the @entity37 's designer stores during a national holiday meanwhile , a man hands over his credit card to a female shop assistant , who clutches it carefully between both hands as if holding a gift , lowers her head reverentially and makes an elaborate show of averting her eyes out of respect			1
his parcel neatly beribboned in a yellow carrier bag , he leaves the shop and follows the droves of customers heading into a nearby shop , enticed by large @entity35 language signs proclaiming 75 per cent off sales			1
it could be an ordinary day on any luxury shopping street in @entity59 — but this is the heart of @entity61 ’s @entity37			0
and the @entity35 signs , @entity23 - speaking shop assistants and extra deliveries of sought - after designer goods — in especially small sizes — are all part of making the high - spending visitors who have travelled here this week from @entity70 , @entity59 and @entity71 feel at home			1
wave upon wave of @entity35 visitors , in small groups and coach parties , alone and in pairs , pack the pavements and malls			1
they are surprisingly young and rich			0
and they are here to splash their cash			0
the reason for this sudden influx is that it ’s @entity86 in @entity35 , a week - long holiday that kicked off with @entity88 on october 1 — the day the @entity89 was founded in 1949			1
browsing : the reason for this sudden influx is that it ¿ s @entity86 in @entity35 , a week - long holiday that kicked off with @entity88 on october 1 ¿ the day the @entity92 was founded in 1949 it ’s the time when the country ’s wealthiest and most adventurous hop on long - haul flights and come to @entity61			1
@entity97 of their shopping lists are luxury goods — the handbags , shoes , watches and expensive knick - knacks which , because of stringent @entity35 taxes , are about 30 per cent more expensive back home			1
no wonder @entity108 retailers leap with excitement			1
quite simply , the @entity35 spend unbelievable amounts of money ; an average of £ 8,000 each on shopping alone , according to one recent survey			1
it is not just the clientele of @entity61 ’s busiest shopping streets which is transformed during @entity86 — the staff in luxury stores are supplemented by droves of @entity35 speakers , signs directing shoppers around the store are in @entity23 , and even the customs when it comes to paying for goods are different			1
with so much money up for grabs , competition between stores is fierce			0
popular : @entity133 won an early battle for the @entity35 ; their livery is yellow , the imperial colour of @entity35			1
according to them , their image is ¿ young and dynamic ¿ , like their @entity35 visitors @entity133 won an early battle for the @entity35 ; their livery is yellow , the imperial colour of @entity35			1
according to them , their image is ‘ young and dynamic ’ , like their @entity35 visitors			1
as if on cue , hordes of waif - like @entity35 girls with long , impossibly shiny dark hair and tiny mini-skirts charge through @entity133 ’ rotating doors and head straight for the @entity150 handbags			1
one girl snaps up a £ 1,500 black tote — then decides she really needs it in grey , too			0
it ’s not hard to see why shops bend over backwards to keep their high - spending @entity35 customers happy			1
in addition to accepting @entity35 ’s most popular credit card , @entity161 ( @entity161 ) , the store has 40 @entity23 interpreters on call this week			1
and it ’s not just @entity133 ; @entity165 has over 100 interpreters , who helped each @entity35 customer spend an average of £ 3,500 per visit last year			1
prepared : @entity165 has 100 interpreters on hand to help @entity35 shoppers even non-mandarin speaking assistants are taught how to tend to the high - rolling @entity35 customers — including holding credit cards with two hands , according to @entity35 etiquette			1
@entity35 men , apparently , will buy many watches from the most evocative brands such as @entity181 and @entity182 , but they want information ; as they do about wine in @entity185			1
they might be incredibly rich , but unlike the @entity186 who block up @entity188 with their clamped @entity189 during the ‘ @entity190 ’ , the @entity35 are quiet , discreet and polite			1
they often take their booty back on the @entity192 , and yes , they ’ll offer up their seat to a more deserving traveller			0
they often stay in unflashy hotels you ’ve never heard of ( those willing to provide a @entity35 breakfast , often consisting of congee , a watery rice porridge and deep - fried dough ) while spending thousands of pounds on clothes , bags and jewellery			2
indeed , to the @entity35 one thing is sacrosanct — the designer label			2
these goods are badges of arrival and belonging			0
life of luxury ? although @entity35 shoppers spend big on labels , they do n't necessarily stay in @entity61 's poshest hotels numbers of @entity35 visitors have been steadily growing over the past few years ; 20 years ago there were hardly any , a legacy of chairman @entity220 ’s belief that travel for pleasure was anti-socialist			1
now they are making up for lost time			0
three years ago , just over 100,000 @entity35 came to @entity108 ; last year , 150,000 came			1
given that only three per cent of the one billion population have left mainland @entity35 so far , and that their wealth is increasing , numbers can only explode further			2
most come here seeking out the obvious brands : @entity226 , @entity150 , @entity227 , and the ‘ heritage ’ brands , which means anything with a quotable history , like @entity231 , @entity232 or @entity233			0
@entity236 , 26 , who works for an oil company , and her boyfriend @entity235 , also 26 and working in finance , travelled here from @entity70			0
' we love being in @entity61 , and everything about @entity108			2
' @entity236 , 26 dressed in jeans and trainers they look about 19 , and you would n’t guess they were about to splash out on designer clobber , although on closer inspection she already has a £ 900 @entity226 bag			0
‘ we love being in @entity61 , and everything about @entity108 , ’ @entity236 enthuses			2
although she says she is on the hunt for her favourite brands , @entity232 and @entity231 , she ’s also fond of @entity255			0
@entity256 , 31 , from @entity70 , says she has only bought one pink @entity150 handbag so far — ‘ not the newest model , ’ she says in disappointment , though her friend has ‘ bought the whole of @entity231 ’			0
the more fashion savvy girls are keen on modern designers like @entity265 and @entity266 — in the tiniest sizes			0
big business : as well as designer brands , @entity35 shoppers also love high street brands such as @entity255 and they have no problems fitting into the slimmest - cut dresses — our sizes 6 , 8 and 10 equate to their small , medium and large , meaning a @entity108 size 12 would be extra large			1
during @entity86 , the visitors come with huge shopping lists for friends and family ( as well as their own wish lists ) , because @entity35 culture is a gift culture			1
almost every occasion necessitates a gift , and the compliment must always be repaid			0
so exacting are their requirements that i met one couple whose shopping list was a computerised spreadsheet , covering colleagues , friends and relations			0
it looked long enough to take all week			0
so strong is the tide of shoppers that as of this @entity86 , they even have their own glossy magazine ; an edition of @entity301 launched for the @entity35 in @entity61			1
editor @entity302 has a clear idea of her audience : ‘ they are extremely focused ; and come with huge lists for labels like @entity307 and @entity231			0
everybody wants them , of course , as they spend phenomenal amounts of money			0
’ spend , spend , spend : @entity35 shoppers with @entity133 bags on @entity61 's @entity314 once they have snapped up the best @entity61 labels , the most determined shoppers fly up to @entity317 to sample the cashmere and tartan for which @entity320 is known			1
in @entity323 shopping centre , @entity61 , there is a standard look among the young @entity35 women			2
poker - straight , long hair with a side parting , painted nails in bright colours , jeans , a @entity226 bag in the company ’s brown ‘ @entity226 ’ monogram print — and an @entity20 glued to their hand			0
in @entity339 , the luxury section of the centre , assistants admit that they deliberately shift stock around to attract @entity35 eyes — and who can blame them ? @entity227 has rolled out precious skin handbags — crocodile and python are favourites — beloved of the @entity35			2
@entity348 , the jewellery and cufflink brand , have made a dragon necklace and cufflinks			0
@entity353 even have a ‘ @entity355 limited edition @entity354			0
’ they all tell the same story ; a growing market of high - spending under 35s in search of big names			0
as they are newly - affluent , they will also travel out of town to secure a bargain ; hence the popularity of @entity367 , the discount retail park in @entity368 where the @entity35 arrive in coachloads			2
for the young @entity35 , this is a bigger draw than the @entity371			2
when @entity373 asked the @entity35 ambassador how to get more visitors here , he was told to build more @entity376			2
it ’s not all smiles , though			0
back at @entity133 a couple called the @entity380 are in search of something to eat			0
they leave the shop anxiously in search of a @entity35 restaurant			2
@entity231 and @entity232 handbags are one thing — the heritage of @entity108 food , apparently , quite another .			2

@entity35 shoppers are in the @entity108 during the @entity86 national holiday
retailers are prepared for the influx and are *delighted* at the extra trade
