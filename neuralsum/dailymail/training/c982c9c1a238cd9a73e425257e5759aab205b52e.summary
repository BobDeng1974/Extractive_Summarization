' the other thing that ’s really bad for your gut and skin , and really bad for your mind , is stress levels			2
anything you can do to reduce your stress levels - which is hard if you ’re under economic pressure or in relationship pressure - those things take a toll on you and your skin			1

i do n’t think about it a lot			0
i do n’t wear a lot of makeup during my everyday life - i would for a character - but it ’s all about making sure your skin is clean			2
' for me , the thing i ’ll never give up is my skincare			0
i ’ve also learnt how highlighting can change your face			0
i ’m also not faddish about it , so it has n’t really changed that much to be honest			0
i use the @entity67 @entity148 and i cleanse , and i get up and do the same thing , ' she said			0
the blonde beauty also opened up about ageing gracefully , admitting : ' whenever i have those days - and we all have them - and i go “ oh , i do n’t like this bit or that bit ” , i always have to ask myself what it is and that ’s what i have to work on			2

' @entity1 revealed that working out and meditating more will be at the top of her priorities list this month she continued : ' i really subscribe to the @entity167 philosophy that in order for something to be perfect , it needs to contain its grain of imperfection			1
' in @entity174 for instance , when a plate breaks , they ’ll put it back together but they ’ll put gold along the cracks – they ’ll celebrate the crack			0
whereas in the @entity183 , i feel like we ’re always trying to pretend the crack ’s not there or throw it away and get another one			0
' i think we should throw out the notion of trying to attain all that perfection that is n’t possible			0

' if i do n’t do something in the morning then i do n’t get it done because then the day takes over			0
and often it does take over for one thing or another			0
' i ’ve so many friends who have incorporated the idea of meditating at some point during the day , so i would love that			0
there ’re so many apps now and the world can get so noisy ; we ’re so addicted to being busy			0
i would really love to find that 15 minutes a day to just be still and quiet			0
' it seems that @entity1 may find it difficult to find some downtime over the coming months thanks to her new movie role alongside @entity221			1
@entity222 , 48 , who recently split from her director husband , @entity224 , plays the kooky @entity225 in @entity226 , while @entity1 plays the menacing evil stepmother			1
