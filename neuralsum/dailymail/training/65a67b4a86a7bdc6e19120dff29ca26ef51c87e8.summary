by @entity1 reporter published : 18:12 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 28 february 2013 surging forward in desperation after weeks without food or water , these forlorn , whimpering dogs were left to die in filth by gangsters cashing in on the celebrity craze for ‘ handbag - size ’ dogs			1
in another haunting photograph taken minutes after a raid on an illicit breeding den , the pleading eyes of a bulldog whose neck narrowly fits through the wire struts of his cage tell a harrowing story of cruelty and neglect			1
the malnourished pedigree dogs were unwanted breeding stock for an underground industry netting millions of pounds a year for criminal gangs — until their rescue by one remarkable @entity30 woman			1
left to die : whimpering dogs that have been used to breed puppies			1
they were left without food or water when their gangster owner abandoned them in their filthy illicit den @entity40 , 70 , last year awarded an mbe , has spent 20 years battling against their inhumane treatment by @entity45 breeders , and the authorities who turn a blind eye			1
mrs @entity40 , director of @entity49 , is bravely taking on a complex network overseen by the notorious @entity52 mafia , who have found breeding dogs even more profitable than drugs and prostitution			1
the ruthless gangs snatch cute puppies off their mothers from as early as one week old so they can be displayed in gaudy pet shops , where small dogs with painted nails are the must - have fashion accessory — a @entity65 trend popularised by celebrities such as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and model @entity70			1
‘ the dogs are left to breed among themselves in tiny apartments , ’ says mrs @entity40 , originally from @entity72			1
‘ then , one day , the breeders realise they have too many — and that they ’re too big to sell — and just go			1
a lot of gangsters will be arrested for an unrelated crime and the dogs get left behind			1
sometimes these places are so filthy you ca n’t step inside			0
caged : a bulldog tries to escape through a gap in the wire and a @entity86 awaits his fate on death row behind bars : another casualty of the craze for tiny dogs ‘ i ’ve been chasing one breeder for years			1
when we went to his premises on the southern island of @entity99 , we found dead and dying dogs everywhere			1
‘ there were hundreds of dogs crammed into tiny cages			1
they were underweight , with terrible skin conditions			0
the breeder had just left them and locked the door behind him			0
‘ for these gangsters dog breeding has become very lucrative			2
they were into drugs , guns and prostitutes , but now they are all into dog breeding			1
‘ one of them tried to attack me ; i had to run for my life			0
he was prosecuted eventually , and he was banned from breeding			2
the penalty was a fine of about £ 2,000 , not a proper penalty			0
‘ he is still breeding now			2
people had been complaining , but the authorities did absolutely nothing			0
’ even when the authorities are persuaded to intervene , the freed dogs face a terrible fate , sent to a mechanised death row where they are allowed one week ’s grace for a new owner to emerge			1
after that , they are gassed in a steel container called a ‘ dream box ’			0
a @entity1 investigation has uncovered new details of what is effectively a state - sanctioned policy of extermination			0
at the ‘ animal welfare ’ centre in @entity145 , recently built for £ 16 million , death - row dogs are placed into a special truck to be gassed off site before being cremated			2
the impressive building is set in landscaped parkland with a playground and picnic tables on the front lawn			0
it does a remarkable job of disguising its true purpose			0
our saviour : brave @entity40 on the day our reporter received a tour , some of the native @entity45 @entity86 dogs had two days left before the metal bars to the rear of their cages would slide up to announce the end of their lives			1
seeming to have a tantalising glimpse of freedom , the animals will then walk unknowingly into a narrow steel corridor in which a separate metal plate nudges them forward			0
at the touch of a button , they are forced to step into a container called a dream box , which will soon be filled with noxious carbon dioxide			0
the box , on which the soothing @entity45 word for ‘ sleep ’ has been written , is lowered into a waiting truck			1
once the lorry has moved calmly off the premises , the gassing begins , activated by a vet at a control desk			0
it takes approximately two minutes for the animals to die and then be driven off for cremation			0
up to 20 are killed here every working day			2
fashion follower : @entity68 with her little friend and @entity70 with a puppy in a bag as mrs @entity40 says , ‘ outside it ’s like a @entity196 ; inside it ’s like @entity198			2
they have spent millions coming up with a system so they can press a button to gas the dogs , and no one knows where it is taking place			2
’ when mrs @entity40 arrived in @entity45 40 years ago , she was shocked by how little her adopted country cares for stray and unwanted animals			1
‘ the tiny , chic dogs are flavour of the month , ’ she says			2
‘ it has been a boom over the past ten to 15 years			0
they are all trying to breed the smallest one , the kind of dogs you can fit in a tea cup like @entity217			2
‘ a lot of them are being bred for unusual colours or markings , too			0
what are essentially genetic defects are considered desirable			0
people like that , and they do n’t think they will have big problems with that dog when they buy it ; they just think : “ oh , that ’s cute , it matches my bag			0
” ‘ these puppies are shampooed , they are blow - dried and they have their nails painted			1
but their feet do n’t touch the ground , so they have no muscles			0
’ mrs @entity40 ’s current favourite among the 180 animals at her sprawling sanctuary for rescued dogs is a three - legged stray nicknamed wireless			1
he got his moniker after being found with a wire noose embedded in his leg			2
vets at the sanctuary had to amputate the limb			0
just one more victim of this sickeningly cruel trade .			0

gangs snatch puppies off their mothers from as early as one week old
display them in pet shops where small dogs with painted nails are fashion hit
in @entity45 , breeding dogs even more profitable than drugs and prostitution
dogs rescued from breeders are killed if new owner can not be found in week
