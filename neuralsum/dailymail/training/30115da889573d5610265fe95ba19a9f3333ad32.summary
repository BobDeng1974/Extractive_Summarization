rant : after her son decided not to take an action figure to school because the drill in its hand looked like a gun , @entity9 fired off a tirade about over parenting and how society should let boys be boys and girls be girls he was looking for something to take to show and tell and decided on an action figure that held a little drill			1
but then he changed his mind : ' i better not take this			0
my teacher will probably think it 's a gun , and then i 'll get in trouble			0
' @entity9 was blown away and began to wonder if her boys , who love to play with toy guns , would one day be the target of hatred because of their ' typical boy - ish behavior			1
' controversial : ' my kids are not the center of my world ' : the 21 - year - old says a bullied girl who ' contemplates suicide ' feels too entitled to a ' world - wide pity party ' ' how long before they get suspended from daycare ? ? ? how long will it be before one of them gets upset with a friend , tells that friend to go away and leave them alone , and subsequently gets labeled as a bully ?

' the mentality of our society in 2013 is nauseating to me , friends , ' she writes			0
@entity9 says that there was once a time when boys could be boys and shoot toy guns at each other and ' killing the bad guys			1

as for young girls , @entity9 says their typical behavior is being punished these days , as well			2
she writes of an imaginary girl named @entity117 who is picked on and called names : ' @entity117 's whole world crumbles around her , she contemplates suicide , and this society encourages her to feel like her world truly has ended , and she should feel entitled to a world - wide pity party			1

' to be fair , many of the comments on @entity9 's blog are positive and commend her for daring to question current wisdom about firearms and bullying			2

@entity27 of @entity2 was *inspired* to write her rant against *over-parenting* when she heard her son 's take on toy guns in the *classroom*
' many years *ago* , there was a time where young boys could run around with their toy guns ' : @entity9 says she 'll always let her boys play with toy guns
the working mother of two also says that today 's bullied children who contemplate suicide feel ' entitled to a world - wide pity party '
