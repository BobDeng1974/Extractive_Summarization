by @entity0 for @entity1 how many people does it take to solve a @entity5 's cube ? the answer is 84 people - and a monkey and a snake - from eleven different countries , according to a filmmaker who took the puzzle on a trip around the world			1
@entity15 set off on the trip after graduating from @entity16 in economics in may , but he decided to take a bit of light entertainment with him - in the form of a @entity5 's cube			1
for the puzzle to be solved , each face must be returned to one colour			0
in order to allow people from all over the world to take part and decipher the code , @entity15 planned the moves beforehand			1
he then asked people in each country to complete a single move under his instruction while he filmed them with his @entity34			0
@entity15 also included some brilliant footage of a monkey playing with the cube and a snake slithering past			2
' when i asked people to do their move , i told them which move they have to take , ' @entity15 explained to @entity43			2
' it 's basically impossible to have people know what move to make if you just hand them a @entity48 and say " go "			0
' monkey business : @entity15 gave this @entity5 's cube to the mammal to see if it would make the right move @entity15 began his journey in @entity54 before moving on to other countries like @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and his native @entity59			1
' i had to spend an average of 5 minutes demonstrating what i was asking from them			0
' this is , after all , an odd thing to ask a random stranger			0
i 'd say , eventually , i got much better at asking the right people to do the move			0
' despite only being able to speak @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity15 was able to signal to people in other countries how to complete the cube .			1
