by @entity0 belief : mr justice @entity2 ruled the parents were not to blame for their daughter 's death and ' deserved to be believed ' a father accused of suffocating his baby daughter by rolling onto her as they slept can be reunited with her twin after a judge ruled that the sister should not be removed by social services			1
the ' intelligent ' middle class father came under suspicion following the death of his 16 - week - old daughter last year , with @entity16 leading the case against him			1
his dead daughter 's identical twin sister was temporarily removed from the family home but following an in - depth inquiry , mr justice @entity2 has now cleared him of all blame			1
@entity16 pointed the finger at the father after social workers highlighted the fact that the twins ' older sister - identified in court only as ' k ' - had been taken to hospital with a serious head injury in 2011			1
they argued that the father and the children 's mother ' knew more than they were saying ' about how ' k ' suffered a fractured skull			1
however , following an in - depth inquiry , mr justice @entity2 ruled that the parents were not responsible either for @entity41 's injury or the death of her little sister - identified as ' l '			1
the judge ordered that both ' k ' , now aged three , and the surviving twin be restored to their parents ' care			2
describing the couple as ' very close , intelligent , hard - working and aspirational ' , the judge said they were of good character and ' deserved to be believed '			1
social workers claimed that ' l ' ' probably died as a result of her father lying on her when he was sleeping on the same sofa '			1
it was suggested that the father had covered up the baby girl 's ' accidental suffocation ' by placing her in her rocker after her death			1
the mother accepted that the twins ' sleeping arrangements on the night of ' l '' s death was ' not the greatest idea '			2
but the couple otherwise disputed every part of the council 's case during an eight - day @entity74 hearing			2
accused : the ' intelligent ' middle class father came under suspicion following the death of his 16 - week - old daughter last year , with @entity16 ( headquarters pictured ) leading the case against him the judge said a postmortem had recorded the cause of ' l '' s death as ' unascertained '			1
he accepted that the parents ' account of what happened could not be ' accepted without question ' and ' acknowledged the possibility that they have put their heads together to cover up a case of overlaying '			0
however , he ruled : ' for the father to have placed ' l ' in her rocker , knowing that she was moribund , and then gone to bed would be extremely out of character			2
there is no reliable evidence that he did this			0
' my conclusion is that we simply do not know when or why @entity100 died			0
nor has it been proved that either of the parents knows			0
' a finding against the parents would be based on speculation or suspicion , which would be impermissible and wrong			2
' ' the sleeping arrangements that were made for such small babies were obviously unwise , but that does not cross the threshold for intervention			0
' the council insisted that one or both of the parents knew how ' k ' was injured but that they were intent on ' concealing ' the truth			0
however , the judge said : ' with some hesitation i find that the parents ' account of events can be accepted			0
' i can not conclude that it is more probable than not that they are concealing a known incident			0
' the judge concluded : " i therefore find that the grounds for making care orders do not exist			0
' in consequence , the children will return to the care of their parents			0
