by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 26 september 2013 @entity3 and famous @entity2 are increasingly choosing to travel in armoured vehicles with features life electrified doorhandles and sealed ventilation systems to protect against gas attacks			1
rap stars @entity10 and @entity12 and actor @entity13 are among the jittery stars to have invested in armoured cars built , in many cases , to withstand even large - calibre ordinance			1
an executive at one company catering to such security conscious clients says that demand in the @entity2 has soared particularly in the past five years , as inequality has risen after the banking crisis			1
overkill ? a @entity27 - made @entity26 , two of which have just been bought by @entity10 @entity29 , vice president of @entity30 , credited ' the climate of fear right now â € ” the growing gap between the haves and the have - nots ' for the surge in sales			1
his firm strips vehicles back to the bare bones and installs not only armour plating , but also gadgets like electrified door handles to discourage carjackers and over-zealous paparrazzi			1
the cars , which look virtually indistinguishable to other vehicles , can take two to three months to complete , at a cost of up to $ 100,000			1
security conscious : rapper @entity10 recently splashed out on two @entity26 armoured cars costing around $ 1.2million each mr @entity29 told @entity50 that a ' large part ' of his customers are ' celebrities , pro athletes and rock stars ' , but they also have many buyers who are ' people not in the spotlight '			2
many stars , particularly those involved in the gangster - fetishising mainstream rap music industry , may be mindful of the fate of @entity63			2
@entity63 , better known by his artist name @entity63 , was leaving a @entity66 party @entity67 party in 1997 when a car pulled up beside his his			2
its driver opened fire , spraying the door of @entity63 's @entity74 with 9mm bullets			2
the star was hit four times and killed			2
he was just 24 years old			1
memories of @entity63 's fate , and the explosion in carjacking after the @entity67 riots five years earlier , have been among the best advertising for armoured vehicles			1
but there is no denying they are also an ostentatious status symbol			0
one of the most extreme examples is the @entity26 made by @entity27 's @entity89 , the same company that built @entity13 's gold - plated presidential suv featured in @entity91			0
@entity10 recently ordered two @entity92 at a staggering cost of $ 1.2million ( Â £ 750,000 ) each , car website @entity95 reported			0
it 's not only specialist manufacturers who are meeting the demand			1
@entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , among others , all quietly make armoured versions of their upmarket vehicles			0
@entity102 boasts that its 7 @entity107 not only offers ' an unforgettable driving experience ' but is also ' designed to meet the highest protection standards '			0
as well as being able to withstand high - velocity , armour - piercing rounds , the car is equipped with run - flat tyres and sealed ventilation to keep the air inside fresh while all around are dying from chemical gas			0
meanwhile , @entity117 - based @entity30 has custom built bulletproof vehicles for the likes of @entity121 and @entity12 life cut short : @entity63 , aka @entity63 , was just 24 years old and at the height of his fame when he was shot four times and killed as he left a party in the passenger seat of a @entity74 in 1997 but are all these features necessary ? @entity129 , director of @entity131 's @entity130 , which secures the homes of many high - profile celebrities , thinks not			1
' statistically , with the exception of a few cases , i do n't think there 's a need for it , ' he said , adding that much of what the cars come equipped with is ' overkill '			0
but @entity142 , a @entity143 - based security consultant , disagrees			0
he pointed out that a 25 cent bullet will penetrate a non-armoured vehicle ' pretty efficiently '			0
for stars earning many millions of dollars a year like @entity10 , then , spending a fraction of that on an armoured car does n't seem like that silly			0
he added : ' i bet @entity63 ' mum wishes he had			0

demand in @entity2 is soaring as inequality has risen over the past five years
