a political row erupted today over whether parents should be able to smack their children			1
@entity4 education secretary @entity3 insisted people should be free to choose how they discipline their sons and daughters			1
but @entity9 's @entity8 argued ' it is wrong to smack children ' while @entity13 leader @entity12 insisted every parent loses their temper sometimes			1
and @entity17 presenter @entity16 grew so exasperated at student @entity18 saying parents should never touch their child in anger that he slapped him on the hand and told him he was ' talking out of your backside '			1
however , they are not allowed to hit a child with an implement or so hard that it leaves a mark , or causes bruising , swelling , cuts , grazes or scratches			0
it can be the source of fierce debate in @entity44 and in households across the country about whether smacking is ever acceptable , and whether it should be banned in law			1
mrs @entity49 , who was being grilled by schoolchildren on tv , insisted that there was a difference between a ' light tap ' and inflicting serious pain			0
she said : ' i do n't want to criminalise parents if that 's the decision that they take to discipline their child			1
' there 's what we have called reasonable chastisement			2
i do n't know whether it is just a tap on the hand or a mild smack on the bottom but , i think , as politicians , we struggle with this all the time - when does government make a decision or when do we allow parents or carers to make that decision ? ' she was taking questions from readers of childrens ' newspaper @entity77 for the @entity80 show on @entity17			1
the mother - of - one said the government should not be in the business of telling people how to bring up their children			1
but she added : ' there has to be a line , when we say , no , that is a line that you have crossed and that is a child that now needs support from other people ... there have been some terrible cases where children have been abused and some , sadly , killed even by their own parents			2
' @entity17 host @entity16 grabbed @entity100 's hand during a live debate and slapped him mr @entity18 was arguing against smacking , but mr @entity16 said that as someone who does not have children ' you are talking out of your backside ' a senior @entity17 host today slapped a guest on the hand during a heated debate on whether parents should smack their children			1
@entity16 appeared to grow increasingly exasperate with guest @entity18 , a student who was arguing parents should not have physical contact with their child in anger			1
mr @entity18 said : ' in the heat of the moment ... you can not justify a really terrible action just because you are stressed with some sort of difficulty with your child			2
' if you are a parent , your responsibility is not to lose your cool with your child			0
' mr @entity16 repeatedly argued that parents often find themselves in an impossible situation and a small tap could help to bring children in line , before reaching out at taking mr @entity18 by the hand			1
the presenter , who has six children under the age of 14 with his wife @entity133 , told him that many parents would think : ' until you have been there , you are talking out of your backside			1
' later in the debate he reassured mr @entity18 that it was a one - off , joking : ' i 'm not going to do it again @entity18 , do n't run away			1
' mr @entity18 later took to @entity141 to hit back at his critics , claiming he was being ' trolled ' by viewers who disagreed with him			2
mr @entity18 is a student at the @entity144 and a contributor to @entity17 ' @entity146 and be counted campaign he later took to @entity141 to hit back at critics to targeted him with criticism after his tv appearance mrs @entity49 was backed by her coalition colleague , mr @entity12 , who said he had not smacked his three boys but would not judge parents struggling with a disobedient child			1
the @entity13 deputy prime minister said there ' is n't a simple legalistic answer on what the state tells parents to do '			2
speaking on his weekly @entity162 phone - in , he stressed that violence against children is ' abhorrent ' and against the law , but disciplining children is ' a slightly different thing '			2
he revealed his own parenting woes : ' i 've had this , you have got one of your kids playing up badly in a supermarket , you pull them by the arm so they do n't pull all the baked bean tins down off the shelf			0
is that reasonable chastisement ? ' we should n't pretend it is easy that you can set down in a law … the point at which physical between a parent and a child which can sometimes be , well hang on a minute you have got to get in the car , or pick them up or whatever			0
' when does that become unreasonable chastisement ? ' he insisted that he has never smacked his sons , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
' it 's not something i do			0
i have certainly not smacked my boys across the back of the legs , no i have n't			0
' i 'm incredibly adamant that no parent should ever make themselves a paragon of virtue			0
' have i ever lost my patience with my kids ? of course i have			0
which parent has not ? any parent who claims they have been angelically patient … yeah right			0
' there is n't a simple legalistic answer on what the state tells parents to do			0
' but i think we should all as parents and as a society always in the way we treat our own children and other children , treat them with passion and dignity and kindness , love , gentleness			0
' deputy prime minister @entity12 said all parents lose their patience with their children sometimes however mr @entity8 , @entity9 's shadow chancellor , insisted parents should never smack their children			1
' i think parents should n't smack children			1
i think schools should n't smack children			1
i think we should say it is wrong to smack children , because if you start to say its ok then it starts to encourage in which the question is : ' how hard ? ' mr @entity8 has one son and two daughters with fellow @entity9 frontbencher @entity248			1
he stressed that smacking is ' a bad way to bring up children ' but he did not think the law needed to be changed			2
' i think the law is already pretty tough , and somebody who smacks and marks and hurts a child , of course they should be punished , ' he told @entity17			2
while he has not smacked his own children , he had regretted grabbing them			0
' there have been times where if you are standing on the edge of trying to cross a road and your child suddenly leaps out and you pull them back , and you say on the hand ' do n't do that again , ' and afterwards i will probably think to myself that was n't the right thing to do			0
' but in those tense situations sometimes parents do , and i do n't like to do it			0
i have done it myself ; i do n't think it 's the right thing to do and i do n't think you should make that illegal , i think that would be wrong			2
i think the law is good at the moment			0
' an @entity283 spokesman said : ' the @entity283 does not want to see parents criminalised for smacking but it is never a good way to discipline a child			2
' there are much better ways to encourage good behaviour			0
hitting children also teaches them that violence is acceptable and lashing out in anger can also be risky as parents could unwittingly injure their children			0
