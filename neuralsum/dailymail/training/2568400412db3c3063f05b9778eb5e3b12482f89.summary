for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			1
in his new book ' a man walks on to a pitch ' - serialised exclusively by @entity9 this week - @entity0 reveals the ways in which the @entity11 radically changed @entity13 football			1
when we first heard about the @entity11 , we all thought it was just a change of name			1
@entity17 was now going to be called the @entity11 - but what a load of rubbish that turned out to be			1
once the new league started in 1992 , everything about our game changed			2
it became about foreign players , foreign coaches and foreign wages to keep up with the biggest clubs in @entity28			1
there is no point effing and blinding at a player who can hardly speak @entity13			1
you had to talk to them , slowly , reasonably			2
an awful lot of @entity67 coaches ruled by fear and bullying , and the foreign players would n’t accept that			1
they were n’t used to being talked to like that , being embarrassed or humiliated in front of their team - mates			2
the whole dynamic of @entity13 football has altered			1
during one of their rows , @entity88 accused sir @entity92 of having changed			2
@entity92 ’s response was : ‘ of course i ’ve changed			2
how could i have survived this long if i had n’t changed ? ’ he ’s right , of course			2
we ’ve all had to change to deal with the demands of modern football			1
@entity88 ( right ) accused sir @entity92 ( left ) of having ' changed ' during his time at @entity99 @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 make @entity0 's modern era @entity104 @entity105 would have solved @entity13 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity88 , @entity108 and @entity109 make @entity0 's early era @entity104 @entity111 heralded a change in @entity13 football ... he introduced @entity114 and scouting reports @entity116 has the class of @entity118 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity121 and @entity88 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity13 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity121 nearly crossed @entity127 to join @entity128 ... and @entity129 was close to signing too @entity9 's @entity131 interviews @entity0 about his new book it ’s not just that players have agents , it ’s that those agents sometimes have a better line of communication to the chairman than the manager			1
and it ’s not just that the players know who the chairman is - it is that they are on first - name terms and think nothing of putting in a call if they are unhappy with anything from team selection to training			2
what certainly altered was the way you tried to build team spirit			2
the old methods were very simple - bonding sessions , getting the lads to go out for a drink or have a day at the races			2
everybody laughs , falls about , gets into a few scrapes			2
a typical jolly boys ’ outing , but the foreign players did n’t want to know about that			1
i can remember during my time at @entity128 i took the lads to the @entity167 races			2
i thought we ’d have some fun , relax together , come back a bit tighter as a unit - but you would have thought i ’d taken them on a prison visit			2
about eight of them were looking at their watches after half an hour			0
what are we doing here ? why have you brought us here ? @entity128 's foreign players , who included @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , pictured here in 2011 , were not impressed when @entity0 took them to the @entity167 races @entity185 , pictured scoring against @entity187 , looked bored all afternoon at the races @entity0 realised taking players out for a bit of fun during his time at @entity128 was no longer possible the @entity58 manager selects his best xi from the early era of the @entity11 @entity185 never moved out of his seat all day			1
just sat there , waiting for the time to get on the coach and go home			0
would n’t watch a race , would n’t have a bet , just not interested in joining in			0
in the end , it has been the @entity13 footballers who have had to change because at most clubs now they are isolated			1
it is a different life for them now			0
i remember @entity65 brought his fitness coach to @entity56			0
the food at the training ground changed , too			0
lunches at @entity61 had barely altered since my day - steak and kidney pie , loads of potatoes , anything you could get			0
by the end of that first season with @entity65 ’s man , everyone had their own tailored , balanced food intake and a special dietician supervised that regime			1
@entity65 ( left ) , pictured being tackled by @entity101 , helped change dietary conditions at @entity56 my best team for this period includes possibly the most controversial selection of my whole book : @entity109 instead of @entity229			1
i know some people will think i ’ve gone mad			0
but @entity229 was a fantastic player in a fantastic team , whereas @entity109 was performing heroics that built a football club			1
without him , @entity234 could n’t have stayed in the top division for so long , and without that they would not have been able to build their new stadium and its fabulous academy that saw players like @entity118 and @entity240 come through the ranks			0
@entity109 ’s 10 greatest goals would stand alongside those by @entity244 , @entity245 - even @entity246 or @entity247			0
he was a one - man band there for a lot of the time , like sir @entity251 had been at @entity252			1
@entity109 , pictured playing for @entity234 , could have starred for a bigger club says @entity0 the former @entity234 star was happy to remain at the club as it was close to his family in the @entity257 @entity0 believes @entity109 's best goals are comparable to those of @entity246 ( left ) and @entity247 ( right ) people would ask ‘ @entity261 is n’t he playing for @entity99 then ? ’ he was just happy to be at a club he had known since he was 16 , happy to be 30 minutes away from his family in the @entity257			1
i think he would have been brilliant at a club like @entity266 , but just because he did n’t make that jump does n’t mean he ’s not smart			0
@entity121 was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now			0
he almost came to me at @entity128 from @entity271			0
i thought it was an incredible decision by him , after he ’d been such a hero at @entity266			0
@entity121 , pictured struggling with @entity273 , helped to introduce physicality into @entity13 football @entity266 's ' @entity277 ' side , who were champions in 2003 - 04 , are up with the best teams ever , says @entity0 the @entity277 are comparable with @entity99 's ' @entity280 ' , pictured here in 1957 the front cover of @entity0 's new book i met him at his house in @entity285 and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get			1
he had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away			0
i remember talking to @entity292 , our chairman , about him			0
he said the crowd would be hostile			0
i knew that - but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before , i thought it said something about the man			1
in the end , his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in @entity304			0
by the time he did become available - the following january - our needs had changed and @entity307 snapped him up			0
@entity121 is the player @entity266 have never really replaced , but i still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at @entity307			0
should n’t he be at @entity266 ? it is ironic that so many associate @entity111 with the beautiful game , yet his @entity266 teams , with @entity121 - the ultimate box - to - box midfielder - did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern @entity11			1
teams got bigger to compete with @entity266 because they were so strong			0
they were up there with any of the great post-war teams - the @entity280 , @entity128 ’s double winners , @entity322 ’s @entity42 , the great @entity324 teams , @entity99 under sir @entity92 - they deserve to be mentioned with any of them			0
