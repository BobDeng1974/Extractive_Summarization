by @entity0 published : 19:34 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 27 september 2013 it was a sordid affair by any measure of the imagination			0
@entity4 dreamed of running away with her pastor lover , armed with as much as $ 800,000 in life insurance payouts she imagined they would get after they killed her former @entity10 husband			1
instead , @entity11 is serving eight years in prison for conspiring to murder @entity11 , the father of her two children - and the man she called ' @entity17 ' is serving a life sentence for shooting his best friend with his own gun at his office in @entity22 , @entity23			1
betrayal : @entity4 conspired to kill her husband of 19 - years , @entity11 ( right ) after she dreamed of running away with her pastor lover , who was @entity11 's best friend and confidant a new investigation by @entity29 's 20/20 has revealed the sheer levels of treachery and betrayal that @entity11 and pastor @entity33 went to in order to not only murder her husband of 19 - years , but also to try and cover their involvement up			1
' her lover was her hit man , ' said @entity40 , assistant @entity41 in the aftermath of her sentence in june last year			0
' she wanted a perfect life with @entity33 , no matter the cost			2
' leaving her children @entity47 and @entity48 orphaned by her incarceration , the @entity41 circuit court judge @entity46 issued the most severe sentence he could			0
murderer : @entity33 ( left ) killed his best friend @entity11 with his friends own gun and even gave the eulogy at his funeral in front of his lover @entity4 he noted that @entity11 schemed with @entity60 minister @entity33 to commit the march 31st , 2010 shooting of @entity11 , gave him acces to her husband 's gun collection , thought she would get his life insurance and then - horrifically - allowed @entity17 to preside over her husband 's funeral			1
the court heard that @entity11 had allegedly fallen pregnant , despite the fact that her devoted husband had undergone a vasectomy years before			2
and in shocking evidence presented during the trial of @entity33 , the jury heard how killing @entity11 was only the first part of the jigsaw and that @entity17 wanted to murder his wife too			1
@entity11 was a religious man , and owned an insurance business along with his wife of nearly 20 - years , @entity80			1
they had been childhood sweethearts , but lost touch when @entity11 joined the marines only to marry when he returned from his service			0
on the last day of march in 2010 , @entity80 called 911 to report that @entity11 , 42 , had been shot and killed in his office			2
investigators discovered no sign of a struggle and $ 100 was on his deak			0
childhood sweethearts : @entity80 and @entity11 had been married for 20 years when he was allegedly shot dead by @entity33 in march last year they came to the conclusion that this was not a robbey gone wrong , but a murder			1
at @entity11 ' funeral hundreds of people came to show their respects to the popular pillar of the community and listened to @entity33 give his eulogy			2
' we weep not just because of the separation of our loved one but because of the questions that death brings , ' @entity33 can be heard saying during a police recording of his eulogy for @entity11			1
' questions like why , why him ? why now ? ' indeed , police were at the funeral because they suspected that the killer knew @entity11 and would be in attendance			0
it was during this initial investigation that police discovered the vital clue which would unravel the tightly constructed alibis that @entity33 and @entity11 had created for themselves			2
' one of our people went through … a trash canister next to @entity4 's office desk , and there was ... a one - page letter that had been torn up in multiple pieces , ' detective @entity119 told 20/20			2
the letter was pieced together as a happy birthday or love letter and contained the phrase , ' @entity131			0
i am not in control of things yet but when we are fully together your birthday will always be exciting			0
' @entity4 , 40 , pleaded guilty monday to conspiracy to commit murder in the march 2010 shooting death of @entity11 of @entity22			1
@entity11 entered the plea with the understanding that her maximum sentence would be 8 years the letter was not in @entity11 's handwriting and they brought @entity80 in for questioning but she provided them with a concrete alibi complete with exact times and receipts from the @entity152 drive - thru restaurant she went to			2
' no one who was n't preparing for that , would be able to recite their whereabouts down to the minute … the way @entity4 did , ' @entity158 , @entity33 's attorney told 20/20			1
however , when detectives asked @entity80 about the torn up note they found in her trashcan , she did n't have an answer			0
police left @entity80 alone in the interrogation room , where their camera recorded her saying , ' oh great			0
' this sparked investigators into action and it was revealed that @entity4 had in fact been involved in a 10 - year affair with @entity33			1
in evidence presented at their trials , it was shown that in emails from january 2010 , @entity11 and @entity33 were talking of marriage			1
and it was claimed that in february , @entity33 bought her a ring			0
it was around this time that they began to plot the deaths of their respective husband and wife and detective @entity191 told the court that after @entity33 shot @entity11 he was going to kill his wife by breaking her neck and staging a car accident to disguise her death			1
sad : @entity11 was the childhood sweetheart of @entity4 and was married to her for 19 years and had two children in addition to the letter , investigators had found a .40 caliber shell casing which they later matched to an eastern @entity41 farm where @entity11 liked to practice shooting			1
this led them to conclude that he had been killed with his own firearm			0
a friend of @entity11 's , @entity207 told investigators that he remembered @entity80 coming to visit him the night of her husband 's death			1
she appeared calm and collected and only wanted to know about how to collect her husband 's life insurance policy			0
@entity207 found it odd : ' it was n't even 24 hours after @entity11 had been killed , ' he said			0
police came to the conclusion that @entity4 and @entity33 were having an affair and wanted to kill @entity11 to collect his life insurance			1
little did they know that @entity11 had left all his money to his two children in his will			0
however , detectives pressed @entity11 on the affair they believed she was having with @entity33			1
' yes we had sex , ' she admitted and caved , telling police that her ' @entity17 ' had shot her husband			0
@entity33 was arrested , but refused to admit he killed his best friend			2
however , @entity4 told police that love , ' walked in the office and he just aimed and he did n't look '			0
in november , 2011 , @entity33 took a plea deal for second degree murder			2
he is currently serving a life sentence and will only be eligible for parole in 2036			0
@entity80 , was indicted for conspiracy to commit murder , and also took a plea deal to have charges reduced , but had to acknowledge her role in the crime			1
