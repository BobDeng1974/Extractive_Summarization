@entity2 families now have more cash to spend after tax than before the @entity5 came to power , official figures revealed this morning			1
the boost , just 37 days before the election , came as separate figures showed that @entity2 's economy grew faster than any other major rich country in the world last year			1
people 's confidence in their own finances also jumped to complete a ' hat trick of good news ' for @entity18 and @entity19 this morning			0
but over the whole of 2014 , the economy boomed by 2.8 per cent – faster than @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and every other country in the @entity37 group of rich countries			2
mr @entity19 said the revised figures show the @entity2 is ' clearly fastest growing major advanced economy ' in the world			1
separate figures released this morning revealed that in the final three months of the year , the average voter had £ 4,187 left over after tax , up 1.8 per cent on the previous quarter			1
mr @entity19 said this meant that living standards were now officially higher than at the last election , when real disposable income was £ 4,187			1
the chancellor said : ' today we 've got a hat - trick of good news about the @entity2 economy and with 37 days to go the election it 's another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk			1
' the chancellor @entity19 , pictured at a @entity58 restaurant in @entity59 this morning , claimed the economic figures were a triple dose of good news @entity18 was out campaigning at a building site at @entity64 's head office in @entity65 , central @entity66 , this morning the @entity28 said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year – 0.1 per cent more than previously thought he added : ' we 've had a significant upgrade to @entity71 , the highest consumer confidence for over 12 years and confirmation that living standards are higher than they were at the last election			1
' this is good news for families and businesses across the country			2
' so voters now face a stark choice : do we stick with a plan which is working , delivering growth and jobs , or do we put all that at risk with @entity85 whose policies of more spending , more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos			0
' gdp per head – the wealth of each @entity93 rather than the economy as a whole – was also estimated to have increased in the last three months of the year – jumping by a healthy 0.5 per cent			2
@entity97 treasury secretary @entity96 added : ' as we approach the general election , this upward revision in @entity71 is further evidence that our recovery plan is working			0
' but the shadow chancellor @entity102 said @entity103 claims that the economy was fixed would ' ring hollow with working people '			0
he said : ' a small upward revision today in the gdp figures does n't change that overall record			0
this has been a disappointing recovery and it did n't have to be this way			0
' if the @entity103 want to go round and say ' our plan is working , look at the gdp figures ; our plan is working , look at the figures on disposable income ' then we say bring it on because the reality is that this is the toughest squeeze on people 's living standards in a parliament since the early 1920s			0
' he added : ' i do n't think that just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best is good enough			0
