@entity1 would rather see @entity2 leave the @entity3 than allow @entity4 to tear up its rules on free movement of labour , @entity0 has said			1
the chancellor warned the prime minister that he is reaching a ‘ @entity13 ’ by pushing for reform of the bloc ’s sacred free movement system			1
the threat has forced mr @entity4 to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb @entity3 immigration			1
citing senior officials , it said mrs @entity0 told mr @entity4 he was nearing a ‘ @entity13 ’ with plans to introduce quotas for the number of @entity3 workers who can come to @entity2			1
she threatened to abandon her efforts to keep @entity2 in the @entity3 unless he backed down			2
one government insider was quoted on @entity33 saying : ‘ the time for talking is close to over			2
‘ mrs @entity0 feels she has done all she can to placate the @entity2 , but will not accept immigration curbs from @entity3 member states under any circumstances			1
it has come to a @entity40 stand - off and it is now a question of who blinks first			2
’ mrs @entity0 was confident of winning the battle of wills , the insider added			1
it came amid reports that mr @entity4 is ditching his quota plan to appease @entity50			2
ministers will focus on making the existing rules work better for @entity2			2
a source said mr @entity4 ’s plans – to be outlined before @entity55 – would stretch @entity3 rules ‘ to their limits ’			1
@entity58 said @entity4 could not win significant renegotiation from @entity24 because the @entity1 chancellor would block him national insurance numbers ( @entity61 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity3 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed one proposal would ban @entity3 migrants coming to @entity2 unless they had a job to go to			1

they stressed that mrs @entity0 is still publicly voicing support for both the @entity3 ’s free movement rules and @entity2 ’s membership of the @entity3			1
a @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister will do what is right for @entity2 , as he has repeatedly made clear			1
’ but critics said mrs @entity0 ’s warning demonstrated the weakness of mr @entity4 ’s position			1
eurosceptic @entity87 mp @entity86 said : ‘ it is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation			0
the chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the @entity2 by the @entity3 in comparison with other member states ' i ’m afraid it leaves me very suspicious about what the prime minister is trying to do			1
signing up to the @entity99 raises questions about whether he even wants a successful renegotiation			0
‘ on immigration i think there is a question about whether he is making statements he can actually deliver			0
’ @entity108 leader @entity58 said : ‘ the only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum			0
’ former @entity87 minister @entity112 said mr @entity4 ‘ knows perfectly well ’ that free movement is essential to the @entity3			1
he told the @entity115 ’s @entity114 : ‘ all our companies , multinational companies , will go spare if you start interfering with that			0

he said : ‘ if you make a mistake , you should say sorry			0
let ’s be honest about it			0
‘ it was a mistake			0
i said so at the time			0
