by @entity0 @entity2 's defensive problems have only got worse ahead of their visit to @entity5 but manager @entity6 hopes to ease them by signing @entity9 centre - back @entity8 later in the week			1
@entity8 is set to join on loan after recovering from an ankle injury he suffered last month			1
the 21 - year - old has made 35 appearances for @entity9 but his progress has been hindered by two serious knee injuries			2
case for the defence : @entity9 defender @entity8 ( @entity19 ) is joining @entity2 on loan his arrival will be warmly welcomed as @entity2 will still be without the injured @entity22 and @entity23 at @entity24 on wednesday night , while @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 played in saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity29 despite not having trained for two weeks			1
to add to their problems , @entity30 has suffered a minor strain and is out of the squad			2
@entity6 said : ' i think @entity8 would probably have been with us if he had n't gone over on his ankle in pre-season			1
' he has just been coming back to fitness now , so he 's one we are waiting for			2
' he started full training now so hopefully at the back end of the week , he will be a player we would like to get in on loan			2
' @entity6 knows @entity2 need to improve after their opening defeat to @entity29 @entity6 is also working on a deal for a new striker with a loan arrangement also likely			1
' if what we 're working on comes off i 'll be delighted , ' he said			0
' we 've got to give it a chance			0
if it does n't , we will have to look elsewhere			0
rather than taking somebody else , i 'd rather give it a chance			0
' @entity6 knows his side will have to improve on their showing against @entity29 when they travel to face a @entity5 side which won 3 - 0 at @entity60 on sunday			1
@entity6 labelled @entity61 ' the best striker in the league last season ' while he feels @entity64 is more than adequate cover for the departed @entity66			1
danger man : @entity61 has been labelled ' the best striker in the league last season ' , says @entity6 ' it 's got the makings of a really tough game , even if we had been at full strength , ' @entity6 said			1
' but over the years we have been to places when we 're backs to the wall and people do n't give us much chance , and we have shown a lot of character			0
we are going to need that			0
' we need an improvement in performance , individually and collectively , to what we had on saturday , and a good strong resilience in the team because most people will have them down as certainties after what they did at the weekend			0
