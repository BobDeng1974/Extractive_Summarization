the warship , which is now a major tourist attraction , was victorious in the @entity13 , during which naval hero @entity3 was shot dead by a @entity15 soldier			1
historic : the warship , which helped @entity18 to a decisive victory during the @entity13 , has been included in a proposed design for the new 12 - sided pound coin @entity21 has announced its ambition to see the ship featured on the coin , which is expected to come into circulation in 2017			1

councillor @entity29 , leader of @entity21 , said : ' i want @entity10 to be first off the starting blocks for this competition			0

' @entity2 is world - famous and symbolises our amazing heritage as the home of the @entity40 , while the @entity26 has become an iconic modern image for the whole of the south of @entity44			2
warship : the @entity2 is docked in @entity10 , @entity46 , and is a popular tourist attraction battle : the stand - off between the @entity40 and the combined fleets of the @entity15 and @entity52 navies took place on the @entity54 , off the south - west coast of @entity52 modern architecture : the new design includes an engraving of the @entity26 next to the warship ' @entity10 has played a pivotal role in the history of this country			1

' the decision to replace the pound coin with a new 12 - sided version was made after a @entity74 smuggling ring flooded @entity18 with £ 30million in fake currency			0
the £ 1 coin has been in use since 1983 – much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – and 1.5billion were in circulation as of march 2013			1
the outdated technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters			0
out with the old : the present £ 1 coin , left , will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting			2
its replacement will be a reworking of the old - fashioned threepenny bit , which last circulated in 1971 it is claimed the decision to replace the familiar round coin came after @entity74 police raided what was previously thought to be a legitimate mint in @entity100 and discovered sophisticated machines which could produce hundreds of coins every minute , and matched the standard of those used by the @entity105			0
but industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters , vending machines and phone boxes to take the new £ 1 coin could be as much as £ 100million			2
more than 100,000 parking machines will need to be changed at a hefty cost to local council tax payers , diverting cash from other work , such as filling pot holes			0
