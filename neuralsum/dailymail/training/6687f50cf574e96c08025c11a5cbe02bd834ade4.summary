by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 23 november 2013 warning : @entity1 said in a scathing report it was very concerned about @entity4 's performance @entity4 is failing to deliver the post on time to a third of @entity9 ’s postcodes , despite charging more than ever for a first - class stamp , the industry watchdog said yesterday			1
@entity1 said in a scathing report it was ‘ very concerned ’ about the company ’s performance and threatened to impose multi-million - pound fines unless drastic improvements were made			1
@entity4 ’s failure is particularly shocking because the report covers the year from april 2012 , the month when the price of a first - class stamp jumped from 46p to 60p			1
@entity20 , a @entity21 mp on the @entity22 , which is investigating @entity4 ’s controversial privatisation , said : ‘ the @entity9 public is simply not getting the service it needs			0
‘ if there was ever an argument for an injection of new management into @entity4 , it is this report			0
’ in each of the country ’s 121 postcode areas , 91.5 per cent of first - class letters are meant to be delivered the next working day			1
but @entity4 only manages to meet this target in 73 areas , equal to just 62 per cent of the total			1
because of difficulties in delivering post the extreme weather , the @entity39 , the @entity40 and the @entity41 are not included in the target			0
as a result , the post arrives later than it should in 45 areas as widespread as @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and many parts of @entity53			2
@entity1 ’s report revealed : @entity1 warned : ‘ we are very concerned about these failures			2
in particular , we note the poor and highly variable performance of the postcode area targets			0
’ interrogation : the report comes just days before @entity61 are to quiz business secretary @entity62 about the recent privatisation it will now monitor @entity4 ’s service and says it will launch a formal investigation if targets are not met			2
this could result in ‘ enforcement action ’ and ‘ financial penalties ’ of up to 10 per cent of postal revenue			0
@entity72 , chief executive of the watchdog @entity73 , said : ‘ consumers want a reliable postal service and they need to know they are getting what they pay for , especially given the number of price rises over successive years			0
‘ @entity1 ’s analysis clearly shows that @entity4 is falling short in this respect with no clear reason for these failures			1
’ @entity1 points out that the 91.5 per cent target is crucial because it ‘ ensures @entity4 provides a good level of service across the @entity9 , not just in more densely populated areas ’			1
but @entity4 ’s performance has actually deteriorated since it increased its prices			1
during the financial year 2011/2012 , when a first - class stamp cost just 46p , the target was met in 97 postcode areas			1
@entity92 , @entity93 ’s postal affairs spokesman , said @entity4 ‘ must do better and take appropriate steps to make sure targets are met in future			0
’ he added : ‘ given that @entity4 is no longer in public ownership after the government ’s fire sale , it is crucial that we do n’t see a shift in focus away from service delivery to maximising shareholder value leading to a poorer service			1
’ @entity1 ’s report comes just days before @entity61 are to quiz business secretary @entity62 , business minister @entity108 , and @entity109 , the investment bank that advised the government about the recent privatisation			2
the biggest controversy surrounds the pricing of the shares at just £ 3.30 each , with many critics claiming they were undervalued			0
last night , they were priced at £ 5.39 when the markets closed			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ we were disappointed that we did n’t meet all of the regulatory quality of service targets we were required to last year			0
this remains a key area of focus for us			0
‘ @entity4 has the highest service specification of any major @entity127 country and we take our service performance very seriously			2

@entity4 deliver letters and parcels late in 45 areas across the country
@entity1 said it was ‘ very concerned ’ about the company ’s performance
threatened multi-million pound *sanctions* unless improvements were made
the firm made an extra £ **435million** from handling post last year
@entity4 made an extra £ **435million** from handling letters , parcels and other mail in the last financial year , a rise *largely* fuelled by last year ’s price increases .
the number of letters and large letters sent fell by *1.2billion* compared with the previous year , but the amount of money made by delivering them increased by £ *106million* , thanks again to higher prices .
of the *1.4billion* first - class letters sent last year , *excluding* bulk business mail , *117million* letters missed the delivery target .
in a survey , 30 per cent of *people* said they were ‘ fairly or very *dissatisfied* ’ with the cost of postage .
