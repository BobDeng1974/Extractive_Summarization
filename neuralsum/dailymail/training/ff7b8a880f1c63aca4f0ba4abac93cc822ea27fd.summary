by @entity0 published : 15:34 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 15:34 est , 1 february 2013 private care : minister @entity2 prefers to use a nanny to care for her children the minister behind controversial plans to expand nursery and childminder places by cutting requirements for staff numbers has admitted she uses a nanny			1
@entity2 , the education minister , wants to relax current rules which currently limit the number of children a childminder can look after to four			1
the plans have come under fire from some childcare experts who say they could dilute the quality of care for youngsters			1
but miss @entity2 , who has two daughters , will not be affected by the planned shake - up because she has hired a nanny , who she said was ‘ expensive ’ but ‘ an absolute lifesaver ’			1
yesterday she explained that she had found it ‘ impossible ’ to get a full daycare place in @entity27 for her two daughters			2
many mothers returning to work would prefer to leave under - twos with a nanny but the costs , up to £ 30,000 a year , are too high			2
yet coalition plans to make childcare more affordable ignore the option of nannies , focusing solely on nurseries and childminders			1
in addition , miss @entity2 ’s proposals include relaxing the nursery worker to child ratio so that each staff member can care for up to six two - year - olds			1
the argument is that childcare costs would come down and nurseries would be able to hire fewer but better qualified staff			2
miss @entity2 , whose daughters are four and six , said : ‘ i feel i ’m fortunate compared with a lot of parents in being able to afford a nanny but , you know , it ’s expensive , ’ she said			1
‘ when we ’ve looked into trying to find a full daycare place in @entity27 it ’s just been impossible			0
you just can not get one			0
’ however , across @entity62 , the number of nursery places has almost doubled in the last decade , according to figures from the @entity64 and @entity65			2
the number of full - time nursery places in @entity62 has grown from 431,600 in 2003 to 721,500 in 2011			2
new rules : the new limits suggested by @entity70 would see the allowed number of children per member of staff in nurseries or childminders increase from four to six miss @entity2 also revealed she had to resort to bringing her children to work once during a childcare crisis : ‘ we had meetings throughout the day and the girls had to play outside the office while mummy went to ‘ boring ’ meetings			1
‘ all of a sudden one of my daughters bounded into the meeting because she decided she wanted to say hello , to the shock and surprise of the officials			0
' she sat herself on my knee and wriggled whilst we talked			0
the topic of the meeting - childcare ! ’ needed : @entity2 , pictured with one of her daughters in a buggy , said her nanny is essential squeezed families deserved the same service for their children as she gets from her nanny , she said			1
miss @entity2 wants childminders to have better qualifications and training and she wants agencies to cover holidays and sick days			1
she also wants to make the service more flexible , to make it home based and flexible for people who work irregular hours like many working parents , miss @entity2 said she was guilty of ‘ merging ’ home and work life and constantly checking her @entity112 even when she was taking her children to the park			1
‘ i ’m a @entity112 person			0
my office get all these random messages at 11 at night because i find that when the children have gone to bed that ’s a good time to get things done , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s a merger of home life and work life			0
they are n’t that separate , i must confess , and my daughters know an awful lot about childcare reform now because of it			1
’ the minister has been challenged by childminders and commentators to try looking after four children at once after her announcement on relaxing regulations for staff			2
in a riposte to her opponents , she said : ‘ i ’m a parent , not a trained professional			0
i do n’t think being an early - years educator is something anybody can just walk into			0
it [ the criticism ] does betray an attitude that some people have that it should n’t be a professional career			0
’ working women in @entity149 were getting a raw deal because everything had to be ‘ juggled ’ , she said , but in @entity153 childcare was ‘ a completely normal part of everyday life			0
here we always talk about juggling , like it ’s all a bit of a balancing act			0

education minister set to relax rules on number of children per minder
plans have been criticized for ' diluting childcare quality '
@entity2 herself admits she uses a nanny for her two daughters
