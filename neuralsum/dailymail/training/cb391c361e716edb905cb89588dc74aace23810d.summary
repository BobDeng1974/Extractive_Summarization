by @entity0 published : 02:41 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 03:12 est , 22 june 2012 @entity1 reignited her row with the @entity4 first lady last night when she blamed @entity5 for her presidential election defeat to @entity7			1
the pair had becomed embroiled in a political spat last week when it emerged that @entity10 had tweeted support for a politician standing against @entity13 , 58 , in parliamentary elections			0
a presidential aide said @entity10 , 47 – nicknamed the @entity16 – had since been told to ‘ stay in the shadows ’ because president @entity18 was ‘ furious ’ at her intervention			2
backtrack : @entity4 's controversial new first lady @entity5 ( left ) now ' regrets ' humiliating the mother of the president 's four children @entity1 ( right ) but the row dubbed the ' the war of the roses ' erupted again last night when @entity13 , who said she was ' wounded ' by the ' violent blow ' , claimed miss @entity5 had been undermining her career for years since starting a relationship with her ex-partner			1
miss @entity1 , the mother of president @entity18 's four children , had already accused senior @entity35 politicians of not being supportive enough in her 2007 campaign			1
but she went a step further in an interview with @entity4 weekly @entity40 yesteryday , claiming @entity4 's first lady had kept mr @entity18 away from her during the campaign			2
she said : ' i realise that in 2007 ( mr @entity18 's affair with @entity5 ) ca n't have helped matters			1
i now understand why @entity46 did n't help me			0
' in 2007 , i said to myself : ' it will pass , it 'll work itself out			0
' so i took it on the chin			0
' miss @entity1 is said to have told friends that @entity10 is a ' traitor ' who her treated her disgracefully			1
ms @entity5 took to @entity55 to announce her support for socialist @entity57 miss @entity1 said it was unfair that @entity10 had been allowed to carry on writing about mr @entity18 in her ' @entity60 ' arts column			1
miss @entity1 told @entity40 : ' in an @entity62 country , she would have been fired the same day			1
but @entity60 was not unhappy to see me weakened , so they let ( the relationship ) go on deliberately , just like all those others who knew ... ( @entity60 owner ) @entity68 , @entity7			0
' her outburst finished when she claimed that ' i 'm the one whose family has been broken , i 'm , the one who should bear a grudge			0
' @entity4 's first lady said last night she regretted humiliating the mother of the president ’s four children			0
mr @entity18 , who lived with miss @entity1 for 30 years , wanted to make her the speaker of the @entity78 but backed down when she lost the election			1
telling off : following @entity5 's ( pictured right ) @entity55 comments , prime minister @entity80 said ' everyone should know their place ' a friend of @entity10 said she admitted : ‘ i made a mistake			2
’ the friend added : ‘ she did not calculate the consequences			0
’ ms @entity5 , who has been divorced twice , has three sons of her own and said that the only reason she had not travelled to @entity91 with @entity18 for the @entity93 meeting was because they have exams this week			1
intriguingly , ms @entity5 's personal biography has disappeared from the @entity97 website , but another aide insisted that it was ' being edited ' and would return			2
but the same aide confirmed that ms @entity5 was being encouraged to ' remain in the shadows ' because ms @entity18 was ' furious ' at the way she has behaved so far			1
@entity102 : @entity18 initially painted himself as an antidote to the flash previous president @entity7 , who married model @entity107 referring to the tweet , he said ' clearly this can not happen again '			2
despite the continuing saga which has reduced the @entity97 to a soap opera , journalist ms @entity5 's arts column is set to appear in @entity60 magazine this week			0
and she has insisted she will not give up her @entity55 account			0
mr @entity18 has now refused to give ms royal a job because she lost the @entity118 seat in western @entity4 so heavily			0
but , despite consistent defeats since being rejected for the presidency in 2007 , ms @entity1 insists that she can revive her political career .			2
