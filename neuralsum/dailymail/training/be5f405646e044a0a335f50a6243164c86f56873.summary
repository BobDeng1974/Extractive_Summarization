by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 scored goal number 255 in his 250th game for @entity4 but there were some whistles of discontent at @entity9 ’s side as they struggled to beat newly promoted @entity10 – a team who finished seventh in the second division last season			1
@entity1 ’s late spectacular second for the @entity19 champions after @entity21 ’s first half strike put a gloss on what was a far from convincing first home performance of the season			1
discontent over the sale of @entity26 , defeat in the @entity28 against @entity29 , and the failure to sign @entity31 increased the pressure on the @entity19 champions to put on a show but they toiled for large parts against plucky minnows @entity10			2
they might even have been pegged back at 1 - 1 had former @entity40 striker @entity39 ’s second half goal not been rubbed out for offside			0
subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76			0

@entity10 : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity60 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity85 ( @entity84 , 46 ) , @entity87 ( @entity86 , 62 ) , @entity88 , @entity89 ( @entity39 , 67 )			2
subs not used : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			0
booked : @entity95 , @entity83			0
attendance : 70 , 356 @entity21 put @entity4 ahead in the first half with his first goal for @entity4 since a strike against @entity99 last april			1
the club is under pressure to sign another forward to compete with the @entity50 but @entity9 has said that the squad is now complete and there will be no movement ahead of next monday ’s			0
@entity1 also had the ball in the net from an offside position after running on to @entity42 pass			0
the home side ’s first chance came on three minutes when @entity55 ’s free - kick sailed high over the @entity10 bar			1
the newly promoted side were playing their first game in top flight for 43 years and had brought 6,000 supporters with them			1
@entity1 then claimed a penalty after a push from @entity121 in the area but the referee waved away appeals and the visitors immediately had their first chance with @entity127 shooting just past @entity64 right - hand post			2
the @entity130 captain had been picked to start the game with new signing @entity73 left on the bench alongside @entity76 , @entity134 , @entity71 , @entity70 and @entity74 – around 100m euros of surplus talent			0
battle : @entity137 does his best to evade the challenge of @entity10 left back @entity60 tussle : @entity4 midfielder @entity140 loses out to @entity141 in the middle of the park @entity4 ’s next chance came when @entity95 was booked for tripping @entity65 on the edge of the area			1
@entity140 rolled the free - kick to @entity1 whose drilled shot was saved by @entity78			2
@entity10 were playing without fear in their first game back in the big - time			2
they finished seventh in last season ’s second division but were promoted because @entity157 ’s b - team , who can not be promoted , finished third giving their place in the play - offs to @entity10			1
@entity55 forced two corners and from the second the ball came out to @entity68 whose shot failed to make it through the crowded area			0
the @entity167 tried again from distance and this time @entity78 had to get down smartly to make the save			0
finally the deadlock was broken and predictably it came via the right foot of @entity68 whose perfectly executed corner was headed home by @entity21			2
the @entity50 needed a goal having not scored in preseason and with many fans still hoping @entity31 is signed before deadline day to replace him in the starting line - up			0
aerial duel : @entity4 defender @entity56 is beaten to the ball in the air by @entity10 goalkeeper @entity78 skilful : new @entity4 star @entity183 gets the better of @entity10 's @entity88 @entity10 finished the half strongly with @entity127 heading wide from a corner and their supporters chanted ‘ yes we can ’ as the two teams went down the tunnel			1
@entity4 encouraged those away fans with a very slow start to the second half			0
@entity194 ’s side were quicker to everything although it was still @entity4 who had the first real chance of the second 45 minutes with @entity183 going close to his first goal for his new club			1
@entity4 were still struggling to get into their stride and there were some whistles of discontent from supporters			0
the volume of the discontent went up when @entity10 put the ball in the @entity4 net			2
@entity64 palmed a @entity86 shot straight out to @entity39 who scored , but the former @entity40 striker was flagged offside and @entity4 were off the hook			0
@entity183 was replaced by @entity70 and one - time @entity211 target @entity71 , who now looks set to stay at the club , replaced @entity21 as @entity9 looked to add another body to midfield and play @entity55 and @entity1 as a front two			1
@entity1 scored from an offside position running on to @entity68 ’ pass and then hammered in the second from all of 30 - yards out but it was the @entity10 fans making most noise on the final whistle as @entity4 fans filed away not convinced by their team ’s first home showing of the season .			1

@entity4 kick off new @entity228 season with victory over @entity10
@entity1 and @entity21 score against newly - promoted side
@entity183 and @entity68 both started for @entity4 in 2 - 0 win
