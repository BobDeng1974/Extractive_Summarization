by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 in the @entity3 are planning to call a vote next week on a contempt resolution against @entity6 , the former @entity7 official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofit groups for special scrutiny based on their political beliefs			1
@entity6 , who retired in late 2013 with a government pension , led the agency 's @entity16 office and is accused of masterminding a scheme aimed at hobbling tea party groups when they applied for tax - exempt status in the run - up to the 2010 federal elections			2
she has twice refused to answer questions during congressional hearings , invoking her @entity25 to remain silent instead of incriminating herself			1
but @entity2 say she waived that right when she gave a lengthy opening statement during a may 2013 hearing , in which she defended herself in no uncertain terms			1
@entity2 leaders suspect she has information linking political appointees in the @entity34 and elsewhere in the @entity36 administration to the scandal			0
the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth : former @entity7 director of exempt organizations @entity6 insisted that she was innocent during a may 22 , 2013 congressional hearing , but then refused to answer questions -- prompting a constitutional crisis that @entity3 @entity2 want to resolve by holding her in criminal contempt angry tea partiers have rallied against the @entity7 since news broke a year ago that the agency targeted their organizations in order to cripple them in the midst of a busy political election season ' if this thing stops at @entity6 and does n't go higher up the food chain , then i 'm a @entity58 supermodel , ' a male aide to a @entity60 staffer joked on friday			1
on april 10 , that committee voted along party lines to green - light a contempt resolution , a necessary step before the full @entity3 can vote			2
the resolution , which is likely to pass in a @entity2 - dominated @entity3 , also refers @entity6 's case to the @entity68 for criminal prosecution			1
that approach is likely to be a dead - end with attorney general @entity71 , however			0
the full @entity3 voted @entity71 himself in criminal contempt in 2012 , in relation to an alleged pattern of hiding documents related to the @entity78 gun - walking debacle , but the @entity68 has taken no action			1
meanwhile , a federal court is examining a parallel civil contempt lawsuit that the @entity3 filed against @entity71			0
its goal is to force the @entity68 to hand over the documents @entity83 subpoenaed years ago			0
@entity6 's attorney , @entity84 , has asked the oversight committee 's @entity2 majority to consider a face - to - face private interview of @entity6 in lieu of her public testimony , but the lawmakers have held firm			0
@entity84 insisted in an april 28 letter to house speaker @entity93 and majority leader @entity94 that ' ms. @entity6 did not waive her @entity25 privilege ' by proclaiming her innocence in an open hearing			2
he recalled the case of disgraced @entity100 executive @entity99 , who told a @entity3 panel in 2002 that ' no one will conclude that i engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct ' – before refusing to answer questions			1
' holding ms. @entity6 in contempt would not only be unfair and , indeed , un-american , ' @entity84 wrote , ' it would be flatly inconsistent with the @entity25 as interpreted by the @entity107			2
' @entity3 majority leader @entity94 ( @entity109 ) and speaker @entity93 ( c ) are ready to force the @entity6 stalemate to a legally binding vote precedent ? former @entity100 ceo @entity99 refused to answer congressional questions in 2002 about his company 's $ 11 billion fraud			1
like @entity6 , he had already offered a self - serving opening statement at the time , @entity116 universally attacked @entity99 for making a speech during a july 8 , 2002 hearing and then refusing to answer 30 questions – including those asking if he was a @entity1 citizen who worked for @entity100			1
@entity122 , then a @entity123 @entity116 congressman , called for a contempt vote immediately after @entity99 was dismissed			0
' i am not aware of this new theory of selective @entity25 , ' he said then			0
' it 's my position that he has waived his @entity25 protections for all purposes			0
' @entity99 was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2005 for his part in @entity100 's then - unprecedented $ 11 billion public fraud			2
@entity94 spokesman @entity133 told the @entity134 on thursday that @entity6 ' always has an opportunity to address the @entity3 by testifying before the @entity60			0
' @entity93 spokesman @entity137 added that @entity6 ' can avoid being held in contempt at any time by testifying fully and honestly , but she has chosen not to			0
' @entity94 announced thursday during his regularly weekly preview of the @entity3 floor schedule that the @entity6 contempt motion would be heard			1
var docstoc_docid = " 168995951 " ; var docstoc_title = " letter to @entity144 re @entity145 " ; var docstoc_urltitle = " letter to @entity144 re @entity145 " ;			0

next week the @entity3 will vote on whether to hold former @entity7 official @entity6 in criminal contempt
@entity6 has refused to answer questions under subpoena about her part in a scheme to target conservative nonprofit groups based on their politics
she twice *pleaded* the @entity25 , but gave a lengthy opening hearing statement defending herself – which @entity2 say *canceled* her right to stay silent
her lawyer cites the case of *convicted* @entity100 *swindler* @entity99 , who escaped congressional contempt charges in 2002 after refusing to testify after offering similar remarks defending himself
if the motion passes next week , @entity6 will be referred to the @entity68 for prosecution , and a federal judge could decide whether @entity6 has to testify
