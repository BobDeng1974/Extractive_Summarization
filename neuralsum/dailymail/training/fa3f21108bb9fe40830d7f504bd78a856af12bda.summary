the @entity3 in @entity13 is continuing to meet his salary of around £ 95,000 a year while having to pay a similar sum to another surgeon filling his role			1
mr @entity0 was suspended from the @entity18 in @entity19 after being accused of bullying junior colleagues			1
but 18 months previously he voiced concerns about the treatment of a patient who suffered serious brain damage			0
his intervention resulted in a critical report into safety failings			0
mr @entity0 has been prevented from working at a time when his hospital has been heavily criticised for lengthy waiting lists for cardiac procedures			1

a friend of the cardiothoracic surgeon said mr @entity0 suspects he was victimised for speaking out			1
one source told @entity50 : ' there was annoyance on the intensive care unit that he had reported the matter			0
' but a spokesman at the @entity19 and @entity40 told @entity56 , that is ' absolutely ' not the case			2
' we absolutely reject the suggestion that the suspension of the surgeon in question is in any way related to any concerns he may have expressed about the care of patients , ' he said			0

' his case was highlighted by the @entity32 opposition in the @entity74 yesterday , as an example of waste in the @entity3			2
shadow health minister @entity77 said : ' when serious allegations are made against any member of @entity3 staff , it is right that such claims are thoroughly investigated			2
' but there is no reason why it should take over two and a half years			0
' against a backdrop of a crisis in cardiac care that has seen @entity3 patients sent to @entity90 for treatment because waiting times were so severe , the @entity3 can not afford to have specialist surgeons suspended for two and a half years on full pay			2

the hospital has been forced to employ a locum consultant to cover mr @entity0 's work , at a cost thought to be close to the £ 94,000 salary the heart surgeon , pictured , is paid in july 2013 it emerged the @entity18 of @entity13 had been branded ' dangerous ' in a damning new report , that said patients were at risk because of increased waiting times			1

dr @entity133 , the health board 's medical director , said : ' there has been an incredible amount of work to improve surgical services over the last year and things have moved on considerably			0
' however , we do know that there is still much to do and we are only at the start of delivering our ambitious proposals			0
' the @entity3 is reeling from @entity39 's legacy of record - breaking cuts			0
' yet a health board which last year had its accounts qualified for breaching its spending limits can afford to pay a senior surgeon a near - six - figure salary while suspended and pay similar salaries to locums to cover his workload			2
' health chiefs must end their dithering approach which is wasting @entity3 cash that could be spent improving patient care and reducing cardiac waiting times			1
' dr @entity160 , @entity161 of the @entity162 , said : ' i ca n't comment on the circumstances of this particular case , but long suspensions are never good for the individual concerned or for the health service			2
' if an individual is able to return to work after a disciplinary hearing , they will require retraining after a long period of absence			0
' dr @entity133 , the medical director for @entity19 and @entity40 , said : ' we do not take disciplinary steps lightly , but believe that when serious allegations are made the @entity40 has a duty to patients , staff and the people we serve to investigate such allegations thoroughly			0
' we can confirm that a surgeon has been suspended since april 2012			2
we have been following the @entity185 's disciplinary procedure in order to ensure there is a full and fair investigation			0
' unfortunately , through no fault of either party , the process which has already taken far too long , has been held up			0
however , we hope to be able to secure a way forward in the next few weeks			0
' due to the legal and confidential nature of such issues we are unable to say anything further			0
' we would like to reassure the public that the health board is doing all it can to bring this matter to a swift resolution which is in the best interests of all involved			0
' the board confirmed that mr @entity0 's surgical work was being covered on a locum basis to minimise delays for patients			1
