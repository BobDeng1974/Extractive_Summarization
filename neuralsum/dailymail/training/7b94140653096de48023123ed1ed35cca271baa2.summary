the web was awash last week of claims that @entity2 ’s latest @entity4 handset bends when stored in a pocket too long			1
however , experts from @entity7 suggest that some of these claims may have been exaggerated			2
during their own stress tests , they found the @entity4 can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) and the smaller @entity4			1
@entity7 used a ‘ three - point flexural ’ device ( pictured ) to put the handsets through a stress test			1
despite claims made last week that the @entity4 bends easily when left in a pocket too long , the phone outperformed the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) and @entity4 6 - and was able to withstand more force than previously claimed this chart reveals how much force each handset could withstand			1
' deformation ' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend			2
' case separation ' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case			0
the first reports of bendy iphones began on wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape			1
@entity38 user @entity37 then posted a video showing the @entity4 bending using just his fingers , which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times			1
to put these claims to the test , @entity7 used a so - called ‘ three - point flexural test			1
’ this involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device			2
the set - up is said to be similar to the one @entity2 uses to test its devices before selling them			1
in addition to the @entity4 , the researchers tested the @entity4 6 , @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , and the @entity58			1
despite the claims , the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) and @entity4 were the weakest devices			1
they started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs ( 31.75kg ) of force was applied			0
the @entity4 came third , at 90lbs ( 40kg ) , followed by the @entity56 and @entity58 on 130lbs ( 59kg ) , and the @entity57 on 150lbs ( 68kg )			1
the @entity4 results show the handset can withstand 15lbs ( 6.8kg ) more force than the initial reports suggested			2
@entity7 claimed this is more than a quarter more force than is needed to break three pencils			2
' impressively , despite some serious damage from our machine , some of the phones continued to work , ' said @entity7			2
' several of the screens illuminated and were functional to the touch ; we even completed a call from one phone to another			0
' while nothing is ( evidently ) indestructible , we expect that any of these phones should stand up to typical use			0

@entity38 user @entity37 then posted a video showing the @entity4 bending using just his fingers , ( screengrab ) which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times @entity2 also faced criticism and complaints last week about its @entity95 update , after it caused problems with the new phones ’ @entity99 sensors and data services			1
the update was pulled , and the problems should now be solved by updating to @entity102			0
further tests , by @entity103 , revealed the performance of the new phones is n’t as poor as customers have made out , either			0
during initial benchmark tests , the @entity4 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device , just ahead of the @entity4			0
the @entity4 6 also performed well in graphics testing , coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5			0
this was only behind the @entity117 tablet , on 57.1			0
the @entity118 was third , on 40.2 , followed by the @entity4 on 34.4			0
according to @entity7 , the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) ( pictured ) was the weakest of the handsets tested			1
it started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs ( 31.75kg ) of force was applied			0
this was on par with the @entity4 6			0
the @entity12 handset separated from its case when a force of 90lbs ( 40kg ) was applied the controversy was dubbed ' @entity129 '			0
it led to internet jokers posting photos , mocking the unintended new feature ( pictured )			0
a number of these images went viral on social media furthermore , the display on the @entity4 was praised by experts at @entity139 , who called the screen ‘ the best performing smartphone lcd ’ the site has ever tested			2
following the reports , and # bendgate controversy on @entity146 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity143 said : ' with normal use , a bend in @entity4 is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted @entity2 with a bent @entity4 , ' @entity2 shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $ 97.87 ( £ 60.26 ) thursday , wiping out nearly $ 23billion ( £ 14.1billion ) in market value			1
further tests , by @entity103 , revealed the performance of the new phones is n’t as poor as customers have made out , either			0
during initial benchmark tests , the @entity4 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device , just ahead of the @entity4 ( graph pictured )			0

the first reports of bendy iphones began on wednesday last week
customers claimed the @entity4 bent when kept in a pocket too long
@entity38 user @entity37 then posted a video showing the @entity4 bending using just his fingers
to test the claims , @entity7 ( @entity176 ) used a ‘ three - point flexural test ’
this is said to be a similar stress *experiment* used by @entity2 to test devices
@entity7 discovered the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) and @entity4 are the weakest phones , followed by the @entity4 , @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity57
however , the phone was able to withstand more force than reports claimed
