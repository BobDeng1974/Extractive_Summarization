by @entity0 last updated at 12:37 pm on 20th january 2012 when @entity4 ’s brother noticed one of her shoulder blades was more pronounced than the other , her parents were concerned but not worried			1
after all , the then 13 - year - old seemed to be in perfect health and had never complained of any pain			1
but the schoolgirl and her family were left stunned after an x-ray revealed that she was suffering from one of the worst cases of curvature of the spine – scoliosis – doctors had ever seen			1
they warned that if she did not have an operation – which could leave her paralysed – her lungs and heart would slowly be crushed			2
@entity4 ( left ) had the biggest curve in her spine doctors had ever seen			1
she has grown four inches since the operation @entity4 ’s mother @entity28 , a pre-school assistant , said : ‘ we were shocked when we saw how curved @entity4 ’s spine was			1
' the surgeon said it was the biggest curve he had ever seen			2
it was devastating to hear it would have killed her as it was crushing her heart and lungs			2
' ' the operation risked paralysing her , but we had no choice			2
she had to have the operation to survive			2
’ @entity4 , now 16 , has made a full recovery and is an astonishing 4in taller than before the operation			1
her brother @entity45 , 19 , first noticed there was a problem with her back during a family holiday in april 2008			1
mrs @entity4 , who lives with husband @entity50 , a sales director , in @entity51 , said : ‘ @entity45 noticed that @entity4 ’s shoulder blade seemed to be sticking out more on the right side			1
‘ we had never noticed it before , but it was really quite pronounced and noticeable when she was wearing a strappy summer top			1
she was n’t in any pain , but i was concerned about it			2
’ after returning home , a doctor diagnosed her with scoliosis , a curvature of the spine			2
the condition affects up to four in every 1,000 children in the @entity67 and can develop at any time in childhood or adolescence			2
most cases correct themselves naturally , but occasionally surgery is needed			0
a surgeon at @entity73 , where @entity4 ’s x-rays were taken , later told the family it was the biggest curvature he had seen			1
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ when we heard the news , we were absolutely devastated			1
at the time , @entity4 was n’t in any pain and yet we were being told that her life was in danger			1
‘ if her spine was left to carry on curving , then it would kill her			0
‘ it was awful to hear what the risks were			0
the surgeon told us it was the equivalent to open heart surgery and that she could end up paralysed			0
‘ but we did n’t have a choice			0
she had to have the operation to survive			0
’ the schoolgirl underwent surgery in july 2010 at @entity94 , where it took ten hours to fix metal rods on either side of her spine to straighten it			0
@entity4 , with mother @entity28 and father @entity50			1
she has now fully recovered from her operation and is back riding her horse @entity101 again mrs @entity4 said : ‘ waiting for the operation to finish was the longest ten hours of our life			1
' she had been so frightened when she was wheeled down for surgery			0
but she was so brave			0
we could n’t believe it when she came home taller than she had been before			0
‘ she had to buy a whole new wardrobe of clothes because nothing fitted her any more			0
but it has given her so much more confidence			0
‘ she loves riding her horse @entity101 again , she sits much straighter in the saddle			0
it ’s amazing to see how well @entity4 is doing			1
it was a risky operation , but it ’s all been worth it			0
’ @entity4 will have to have a yearly check up , but is not expected to need more surgery			1
a spokesman for the @entity125 clinic , which specialises in treating the condition , said : ‘ we have never heard of a case of anyone who has a spine with a bigger curve than this			0
she has been very lucky			0
