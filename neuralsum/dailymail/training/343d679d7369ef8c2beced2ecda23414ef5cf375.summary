by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 21:25 est , 3 december 2013 a @entity2 beautician sent a would - be robber running sunday when she splashed his face in scalding hot wax			1
@entity6 had just gotten home top her front door after work when a man with a knife approached her out of nowhere and demanded money			1
@entity13 had none , but the man would n’t leave her along			1
that ’s when she gave him an eyebrow waxing he ’ll never forget			0
all in a day 's work : @entity2 beautician @entity6 thought on her feet when a knife wielding man tried to rob her , flinging a pot of hot hair removal wax right in his face who needs pepper spray ? @entity13 shows off the warming but she was carrying , then turned into a weapon of self defense , on sunday evening the family joked to @entity31 that police should just keep an eye out for a man with burns all over his face and back			1
but as ingenious as @entity13 ’s self - defense tactic was , it did n’t come to her immediately			2
she first tried brandishing another hair removal product : a sharp pair of scissors			2
the assailant still would n’t leave , so @entity13 had to think fast			2
her turf : it was 8 o'clock and @entity13 had just gotten off work when the man approached her in front of her home in one hand she held a bag of cosmetics products from work			1
in the other was a warming pot of searing hot body wax			2
putting two and two together , she acted — flinging the sticky goo right in his face			0
the man , who @entity13 described as @entity62 ran , presumably having suffered serious burns , and got into a car with two other men			1
tools of the trade : @entity13 says she first tried brandishing scissors at the man			1
it was when that did n't work that she flung the wax her husband @entity75 arrived home shortly after the startling encounter and at first he wondered why his wife did n’t just hand over the bag of beauty supplies			1
‘ she said , “ he tried to steal my bag , ” ’ @entity75 told @entity31			0
“ i thought she was talking about her purse			0
she said , “ no , my plastic bag ! ” i said , “ @entity88 , just leave it there			0
” ’ he ’s since realized the robber never had a chance			0
‘ he thought he could scare her , and she does n’t scare , ’ @entity75 laughed			0
' she does n't scare ' : @entity13 's husband @entity75 at first wondered why his wife did n't just give up her bag of cosmetics , but admitted that the robber probably never had a chance against his wife			0

@entity6 sent the *attempted* *mugger* running from her @entity2 home on sunday
the man demanded money but @entity13 had none
she first tried *threatening* him with scissors , when that failed she flung burning hot hair wax all over his face
