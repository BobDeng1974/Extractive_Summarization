by @entity0 @entity1 was just 16 when she met the man who would change her life forever			1
the youngest daughter of a nurse and a policeman , she was still at school and looking forward to a bright future			0
that boy turned out to be a pimp and by the time she was 18 , @entity1 , a bright , educated , middle class girl , had disappeared into the world of vice and violence that blights @entity15			1
one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 35 million tourists each year , @entity15 is also one of the wealthiest with net profits worth an estimated $ 15bn generated each year by the lucrative casinos			1
loss : @entity22 told @entity23 of losing her daughter @entity1 , now 18 , to @entity15 ' vice rings but the bright lights of the @entity27 conceal a dark underbelly ; a seedy world of drug addicts , gambling junkies , gangs and violent pimps			1
and it 's in this grim , vice-ridden world that @entity1 now lives - much to the distress of her mother , @entity37			1
speaking to @entity23 on the latest episode of @entity23 : @entity39 , @entity37 told of her loss and utter distress that there 's little she can do to get @entity1 back			1
' in the autumn of her junior year at @entity45 , she met this boy , ' remembers @entity37			2
' all of a sudden , she 's not angry anymore and it all seems to be because of this new boyfriend			0
' but her delight at her daughter 's seemingly benign new boyfriend was n't to last			0
' all of a sudden , he ends up in prison for stealing cars , ' she says			0
' that 's where the grooming happened			0
devastating : @entity37 says her family has been ripped apart by the actions of their daughter 's pimp boyfriend bright lights : @entity15 is famous for its neon lights and casinos but they conceal a dark underbelly ' he was writing her letters , filling her head with all these promises ... writing me letters , telling me he cared for my daughter ... ' after two years in prison , @entity1 's boyfriend was released and @entity37 and her family cautiously welcomed him back into their lives			1
' we spoke to his parole officer , ' she adds			0
' i felt in control of the situation but that only lasted two to three weeks			2
' then they stopped following the rules , they started coming in a little later and we did n't always know where she was ... three weeks later , @entity1 was gone			1
' drawn into a seedy world where women are sold for a few dollars and pimps reign supreme , @entity1 was just 18 - years - old and had had much to look forward to			1
and she 's not alone			0
according to @entity96 , the head of the @entity98 team , a branch of the @entity15 police department 's human - trafficking section , middle - class girls are becoming an increasingly common sight on the streets			1
' there used to be a time back in the 80s where guys targeted the downtrodden - girls with drug addictions or from broken homes but we 're far past that , ' explains @entity112			1
' we 've seen girls as young as 12 and they 've come from a decent family			0
' @entity112 of @entity15 police says the level of violence dished out by pimps to their victims is ' unreal ' arrests : @entity96 has arrested more than 100 pimps , many making millions from vice , during his career sex is big business in @entity15 , with colourful posters advertising escort companies on every other billboard and even on targeted ad vans			1
' the catch is , they are n't selling prostitution , ' says @entity112			1
' it is legal to run an escort company but some of these escort companies are run by pimps			2
' and the rewards for those ruthless and violent enough to prosper can be huge			0
' with three girls , they can make $ 1m a year , ' adds @entity112			1
' one of the reasons they 're so violent and protective of the women that they 're trafficking is that they have so much to gain and so much to lose if the girl should try and come to the police or run away			2
' i 've seen everything from women sexually assaulted , group raped , burned with irons , tattoos burned off them with irons , water boarding ... the violence that we see here is unreal			1
' for @entity37 , her only hope is that her daughter will one day manage to escape her boyfriend , who they later discovered was a pimp			2
' about two to three days before she graduated high school , i came home from work early and @entity1 was there , ' remembers @entity37			2
drugs : many of the women who frequent @entity15 ' underworld are addicted to drugs like crystal meth ' i said " i 'm worried about you @entity1 " and she flipped out			1
she said " ok , ok , i f * * * ing trick - rolled ! is that ok now ? ' you find the drunkest motherf * * * er on the strip , you proposition him , you take his ass up to the room and tell him to clean up			2
' then you steal him ... you steal him blind			0
you take his wallet , his watch , whatever			0
i did it , mum			0
get the hell out of here ! " ' she told her @entity190 agent husband who immediately called in @entity112 and the vice squad			1
' they came over and detective @entity112 had a three - inch binder with her boyfriend 's name on it			1
i was like " what is her boyfriend 's name doing on that binder ? what 's going on ? " ' they basically said they had enough evidence to build a case against her boyfriend as a pimp			2
i let him into our house ! i let him into my heart , into my family and he was slicking off to fool me too			0
' she is n't fooled anymore but @entity37 remains estranged from her daughter and has no idea where she might be			0
' we need tourist money in this town , we just do n't need it off the backs of our daughters , ' she adds			0
' the attitude of @entity15 is do what you would never do anywhere else , and leave			2
and you do n't ever have to think about it again but my family has been ripped apart			0
