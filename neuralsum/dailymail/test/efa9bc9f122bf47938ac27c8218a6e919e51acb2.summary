as a new fashion designer , cementing a place in the market can be tough ground work			0
of course , a few celebrity endorsements and a business partner with a little black book packed with a-list contacts does n't hurt			0
@entity8 , a former model and actress ( with appearances on @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 on her resume ) from @entity15 had been toiling away at her small leather brand for three years , before a very modern encounter - via @entity18 - changed her fortune			1
the 29 - year - old 's brand @entity20 is suddenly the hit of @entity22 , and is adorning the backs of stars including @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and pop group @entity28			1
@entity8 admits that since @entity42 has come on board the brand has sky rocketed from being a ' small solely - owned start up ' to a complete lifestyle brand that 's reaching a mass market across @entity52 , the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
the two met in what is fast becoming the 21st century norm - through @entity18			2
@entity42 , 50 , initially contacted @entity8 to request samples for her pop group , @entity28 , and the rest is history			1
doll to duo : @entity42 , founder of @entity45 has now joined with @entity8 as partner to @entity20 @entity52 a-listers : @entity67 is one of the brands biggest supporters and currently models for the brand luxe leather : @entity67 models on the label 's website - pictured wearing the @entity76 , us $ 999 ( left ) , and @entity77 us $ 239 ( right ) ' when we finally met up for the first time , we got along so well it felt like we 'd known each other for years , ' @entity8 told @entity82 over the phone from @entity84			1
' but it was n't until i came over to visit her in to @entity84 - we 'd been throwing around the idea of launching a lingerie brand , but then i saw her insane jacket collection , and i said : " screw the lingerie line , come in on @entity91 "			0
' according to @entity8 , it was one of the best decisions she could have made			0
' my biggest regret originally was that i did n't start the label with someone , and so when @entity42 and i decided to work together i finally had someone to do the whole process with me '			2
and lend her little black book of @entity22 contacts too			0
@entity42 who counts @entity26 and @entity27 as close friends , and has a wide network of a-listers she has been able to give items from the collection to			2
@entity106 : @entity42 and @entity26 became friends on the set of @entity106 2 close with @entity27 : @entity42 wears @entity20 puffer vest after dance class with @entity27 friendship on film : @entity42 first struck up a friendship with @entity26 and @entity27 when @entity45 featured in @entity106 : @entity113 at their recent @entity31 launch in @entity84 , @entity26 made a red carpet appearance to support the duo			1
according to @entity42 , the two share a long history together since early days when @entity26 first spotted @entity45 and roped them into starring in @entity106 2			1
@entity26 's favourite pieces from their label are said to include the a leather blazer ( the one seen worn by @entity42 at their launch ) and a motorcycle vest with a hood			1
smouldering : the moto jacket from @entity20 collection costs us $ 750 from the website high - end : biker shorts cost $ 389 , and the silk shirt is $ 289 @entity133 dollar pants : these leather biker pants cost $ 999 @entity27 , not one to miss out either , also received ' a big bag of goodies ' from @entity138 , ' who took them over to her house and dumped on her couch ' and was suitably delighted			2
the girls know the power of celebrity endorsements , and reveal that the 2013 paparazzi shots of @entity25 wearing a @entity20 leather cap was a massive boost despite it happening ' organically			0
' as is the power of their stockists , such as ' @entity153 , ' one of the busiest boutiques in @entity155 which happens to be owned by @entity156 of ' @entity157 of @entity155 ' fame ( she is also the aunt of @entity159 and @entity160 )			0
eclectic resume : @entity8 , 29 , from @entity15 , was previously a model and actress , before starting her own label yet aside from the big name stars showing their support , @entity42 also has a long history in clothing design , with a family history of seamstresses			1
in the early days of @entity45 she would also make the original costumes by hand			0
' when @entity45 began , i made every costume			0
so when @entity8 came to @entity53 and we went through my closet and i showed her everything i had re-done and tailored my way ( even clothing by @entity181 ) it was the perfect marriage			1
' of the brand itself , @entity8 says @entity20 is bold , edgy and has attitude that comes with classic and timeless pieces for the every day girl			1
' my aim is to steal a place in the market for well tailored , classic , quality material items at a good price point , ' says @entity8			0
she likens the label to @entity194 and @entity195 - but with an @entity52 influence			0
@entity8 reveals that @entity197 was originally born out of a period of feeling ' lost ' and lacking direction , and so the label became her new motivation			0
lady in leather : gulliver wearing @entity20 at the @entity153 boutique in @entity155 lost to leather label : @entity8 admits her inspiration for starting @entity20 was after a ' lost ' period in her life ' for me it was a lifestyle choice starting the label , i was in a ‘ place ’ when i started it , i thought , you can talk about it or whinge about life or you can just do it , ' says @entity8			1
' i was n't enjoying what i was doing anymore and when i was on a holiday in @entity222 there was only so much tanning i could do then i noticed all the tannery places in @entity222 and that 's when the idea came to me			0
' now those restless , tanning days are long behind her , the question is how is she adapting to the non-stop business life of a business owner ? ' it 's stressful at times , the production side of things , language barriers et cetera , but while it 's busy and hectic but i do have a work life balance and i 'm doing something i love that is rewarding , ' she says			0
@entity15 model to @entity84 label : @entity8 has grown @entity20 from small start - up to @entity84 lifestyle brand so what 's next for the leather label ? a vegan leather line is their newest addition , which , according to @entity42 , is already gaining massive ' street cred ' amongst the fashion scene in @entity84			1
' i 've been walking around in the non leather puffer vest and people are like where did you get that ? and i say , " it 's our line "			0
then there 's a sport luxe line in collaboration with the pre-existing @entity45 's label			1
' we are in the developing stage of sport luxe line , @entity45 sport			2
so it will come under the @entity45 name , but under the @entity270 umbrella with @entity45 as inspiration for the collection , ' says @entity42			2
the @entity274 ' range is hoped to be out for the @entity53 summer , as @entity276 shows begin soon and they plan to style the group for the show season			0
fashion vs @entity280 : @entity42 and @entity8 rub shoulder with stars such as @entity283 ( pictured middle ) @entity8 has also started consulting as a social media guru for their new joint venture - social media advisory brand - ' trendsetters			1
' ' @entity8 comes from incredible social media background and we would n’t be able to do the business or have met if it was n't through social media , ' says @entity42			2
it seems , the sky is the limit for the growing fashion designer duo , with @entity42 even hoping for a brand collaboration in the future - ' look how @entity302 got started - @entity8 and i are just as talented , we have the business sense and creativity to do that , exciting for what future holds for designers and young brand			1
' as for the lingerie brand they originally planned to do ? ‘ @entity310 , yes we probably will ! ’ right now we 're focusing on @entity197 , but @entity42 and i are crazy so we might turn around in six months and say it ’s time for that lingerie line and we ’ll do it , ' says @entity8 .			2
