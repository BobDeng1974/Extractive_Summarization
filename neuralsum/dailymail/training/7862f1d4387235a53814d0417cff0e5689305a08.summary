watching @entity0 win his world title against @entity2 on saturday night ranks right up there with my best nights in this sport			1
i have seen up close what he has gone through to get to this point			2
he has had world - title fights postponed and people have doubted his desire			2
they have asked whether he has the stomach for it and whether he has the hunger to be a champion			2
he has proved everyone wrong and shown just how special he is			0
he came of age in that ring and great things lie in wait for him , including @entity23			1
i am looking at next spring or summer in a fight , maybe at @entity25 , that will be just as big as @entity27			1
i ’ve started talks on it , but more of that later			1
stomach for the fight : @entity0 ( left ) beat @entity32 @entity2 on saturday blood sweat and tears : @entity0 ( right ) gets stuck into @entity2 in @entity35 special : @entity0 and his corner go wild when he 's awarded the win - now his target is @entity23 before the fight against @entity2 , @entity0 was very quiet			1
i ’d never really seen him like that - i felt he was very nervous but i was wrong			2
he was just totally calm , ready to go out and get what he has always dreamed of			0
we had an hour chat in his room on the morning of the fight			2
i explained what victory would mean and how it would change his life			0
i told him he must not let this opportunity pass him by			0
that ’s the beautiful thing about boxing - after all the training and all the years of dreaming , you ’ve got 36 minutes to make it happen			1
i am a great believer in things happening for a reason and perhaps that is what happened with @entity0 when his world title shot against @entity62 was called off			1
maybe it took missing that fight to realise just how much he wanted a title			2
he came back hungrier , desperate to get what he deserved			0
he trained so hard for this fight			2
he comfortably made the weight , which is all you need to know really for such a huge welterweight			0
and on the night he was brilliant			0
he put so much pressure on himself			0
in his head he was thinking his whole life led to that moment			0
i was saying the same to him in the dressing room			0
but he handled the pressure we all put on him so well			0
i was sitting with @entity81 and he felt @entity0 won with ease			1
it was controlled , professional , brilliant			0
he executed every part of his gameplan			0
for me , he proved he is special – one of the absolute best talents in world boxing			2
@entity23 is suddenly very interested in a fight			1
people from @entity91 , who show @entity23 ’s fights in the @entity32 , came into the dressing room after @entity0 won and said ‘ let ’s talk ’			1
other @entity32 broadcasters have also been on - it ’s exciting times			2
i think this fight can be made , but people have to put arrogance and ego to one side			1
before , when we offered @entity23 £ 3m to fight , he did n’t fancy it			1
@entity0 had a reasonable name and no title			1
he has a huge name and a world title now			0
we kha n't wait : the @entity110 boxer ( right ) is very interested in a fight against @entity112 read @entity114 's exclusive here that changes the negotiating position a lot , but this is such a big fight everyone can do well out of it , so long as @entity23 does n’t demand an unrealistic split we should make it happen			1
i want to make this fight and i think it will be huge			1
maybe @entity125 will feature down the line			1
@entity0 is certainly in that reckoning now			1
@entity0 is next out on december 6 in @entity128 and we will now start looking at opponents			1
@entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 are all names being thrown in the pot but it is very early days			0
we will talk over the options and go from there			0
@entity0 has a great future and i am so happy for him			1
the next big thing : brook vs @entity23 could be just like @entity27 ( left ) - and @entity125 could lie in wait @entity145 sparring with the best @entity145 had a call to go sparring with @entity147 and he is out in @entity148 now			1
i discussed it with him and said he simply had to go			0
@entity147 is one of the greatest heavyweights in history and the best of his generation			2
this is a wonderful opportunity for @entity155 to see how the best do it – how they live , eat , train			0
he will gain a huge amount from this experience			0
i am looking forward to a progress report as i ’m sure @entity145 can hold his own			2
expect him to look sensational on september 13 at the @entity161			0
@entity162 vs @entity27 would be a highlight of next year on @entity0 ’s fight card in the @entity32 , there were great wins for @entity162 and @entity167 , two of the best prospects in world boxing			1
they keep destroying whoever i put them in with			0
for @entity162 , he will next fight on october 4 in @entity173 but i can reveal here that a fight i have one eye on is against @entity177 next @entity178 or summer			1
by @entity177 : @entity162 ( left ) beat @entity179 on saturday and could fight @entity27 next year @entity27 is making his comeback in september and i think a fight with @entity162 could be a highlight of 2015			1
believe me when i say he will be ready			0
@entity167 will fight on october 25 in @entity183 , on a card featuring @entity185			2
both of them have big , tough fights that i will announce next week			0
do n't rule out a return to the ring for @entity191 it ’s never dull in boxing , as demonstrated by @entity194 and @entity195 going into the @entity197 house			1
who knows what will happen next ? since wanting an apparent quiet life , @entity191 was seen at a show in @entity202 last weekend and is now taking part in one of the biggest reality tv shows in the @entity206			2
could a comeback be on the cards ? stranger things have happened ! comeback queen : do n't rule out a return to boxing for @entity194 , pictured entering the @entity197 house @entity214 i would like to pay my respects here to @entity217 , the editor of @entity218 who died this week			1
he was a lovely man and did so much to help me in the early part of my career			0
he loved the sport , knew it as well as anyone and was always great for a chat			0
he will be sorely missed			0

talks have started for a 2015 fight between @entity0 and @entity23
ego can not get in the way of making a fight that could match @entity232 - @entity27
it could happen at @entity25 and @entity125 could be further down the line
i offered @entity23 £ 3m last time but he ca n't demand an unrealistic split now
@entity145 is sparring with @entity147
i *'d* love to make a fight between @entity162 and @entity177 next year
could @entity194 be about to make a boxing comeback ?
