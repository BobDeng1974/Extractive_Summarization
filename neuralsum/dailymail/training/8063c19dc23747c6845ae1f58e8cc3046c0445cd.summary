by @entity0 the @entity4 @entity3 women 's swim team uniform is a shock for all the wrong reasons - part of the country has been left off			1
after the team 's formal uniform was slammed as being ' ugly ' when it was first revealed last month , the latest problem is the state of @entity13 has been completely left off maps of @entity4 that are pasted on the women 's swim team 's one - piece swimsuit			1
the missing state has caused outrage in @entity13 , with many in the state still sensitive about a similar blunder 32 years ago , which saw the island state dropped from a map of @entity4 created by performers at the @entity26 in 1982			1
uproar : tasmanians have been left outraged that a map of @entity4 heavily featured on female swimmers ' uniforms does not include the island state			2
pictured is swimmer @entity33 , left , getting help with her uniform from teammate @entity36 during a training session @entity4 swimmers @entity36 ( left ) , and @entity39 ( right ) , show off their swimming uniform during a training session on tuesday the @entity43 design has even sparked the ire of outspoken @entity46 senator @entity45 , reported @entity47			1
' i hope that it was an oversight and not deliberate			0
@entity13 also disappeared from @entity52 medals and posters for @entity55 ’s movie @entity4 , so it 's very disappointing that the same oversight has happened a number of times , she said			1
the senator has even suggested the state be compensated with $ 5 million for a tourism advertising campaign and money to lower the cost of sea travel to @entity13			2
with funding cuts to @entity13 tourism since 2008 , ms @entity45 said an apology with a payment from the government would not be enough to rectify the error , especially for the impacted tourism sector			2
@entity74 have hit out at the uniform , after the state was dropped from a map of @entity4 formed by performers at the @entity26 in a similar incident 32 years ago			1
pictured is swimmer @entity81 helping sister @entity39 adjust her swimsuit while the women 's uniform is plastered with the partial map of @entity4 , the male swimmers ' trunks are not covered in the controversial pattern			1
pictured is @entity90 , left , and @entity91 , far right , with @entity92 ' @entity93 will be offended and feelings will be hurt			2
we 're very proud of our state , however more than just feelings will be hurt , ' she said			0
during the games , seven @entity13 athletes are representing their state			1
in another shocker , @entity103 was not what @entity4 athletes expected to hear while heading to the flag bearer 's ceremony in @entity108			1
there are reports a @entity112 bus driver played the song by paedophile musician @entity114 ' as he drove the @entity4 athletes on monday , reported @entity47			1
the track was stopped shortly after it started and was featured on an @entity4 hits cd bought by the driver and was the third song after @entity120 and i 'd love to have a beer with @entity123			2
cyclist @entity124 was unveiled as @entity4 's flag bearer during the ceremony			2
@entity124 was announced as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony , during the @entity4 @entity3 official team reception on monday another blunder for the @entity3 was that two unidentified @entity4 athletes set to compete at the games could have missed their chance at taking gold after a blunder saw them entered in the wrong event			1
the unaware pair have not been told of the error because it ' has nothing to do with the athletes ' said @entity143 ( @entity142 ) executive @entity141 , who is refusing to confirm the athletes ' identity or sport			0
' one athlete was entered in the wrong event and the other was not entered for an additional event they should have been in , ' he said			0
he also said it was possible the athletes involved do not know the were caught up in the oversight			0
the mix up saw 48 athletes from eight countries granted special dispensation by the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) so they can take part in their events , reported @entity47			0
entry deadline was june 11 and a @entity163 statement stated the athletes ' administrators were behind the bungle which meant the athletes were not entered could have resulted in them not competing in their events			0
' it was never an issue			0
they were always going to be in			0
we just had to go through a process that did n’t come out until yesterday , ' @entity141 said			0
' absolutely there was a mistake			0
the @entity142 made an entering mistake and we admitted it straight away and we made sure it was corrected			0
