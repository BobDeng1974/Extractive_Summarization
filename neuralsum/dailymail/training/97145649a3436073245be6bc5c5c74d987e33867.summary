fat people live longer than their skinny counterparts because their brains get more nourishment under stress , a @entity6 obesity expert has claimed			1
@entity7 says that overweight people are more suited to the stresses of modern life because their metabolisms are better able deal with it			1
professor @entity7 , of @entity14 in northern @entity6 and author of the book ' @entity17 , ' has been studying the brain and weight related issues for three decades			2
he says it is a myth that fat people die sooner than their thin counterparts			1
fat people live longer because their brains get more nourishment under stress , a leading obesity expert has claimed he said : ' people react to a stressful , uncertain circumstances in two different ways			1
some eat and become fat			2
' the others refuse food and become thin			0
the ones who become really ill are the thin ones			0
the fat ones are , in comparison with the thin ones , much healthier			2
' he added that being thin in itself not a problem , but those who lose weight when under stress are in danger			2
' we have to worry much more about the thin stressed people than about the fat stressed people			1
yet they are not regarded widely as having a problem precisely because they are thin			0
but in fact they die earliest			0
' professor @entity7 told a @entity6 newspaper that he and his colleagues studied ' toxic stress ' brought on by factors outside of an individual 's control , such as poverty , bullying , abuse , divorce , low self - esteem and trouble in the workplace			1
people who do n't eat when they 're stressed are in danger , as their brain gets nutrients from the muscles and organs , rather than food individuals who pile on the pounds under such circumstance ' get the nutrients they need to feed their brains			1
' when the brain does n't get them from external sources , it gets them from within - from muscles and even worse , from the organs			1
@entity84 stressed people are the least healthy people			2
' he went on : ' so far , only the relationship between being overweight and mortality has been studied			0
the cause of the mortality is not in just being overweight , it lies in stress			0
' he said that ' social imbalances ' that lead to stress can not be fixed with diets - rather , it is the duty of government to worry about taking away the stresses of modern day life to get people to shed some weight			2
' society needs to change , not fat people , ' he added			1
asked if there is an ideal weight , he said ; ' @entity107 research speaks only of weight diversity			0
every human being has the survival strategy ideal for his or her life			0
' the ostracism of fatties puts pressure on fat people psychologically			1
' indeed , he said , there are studies that prove that fat people earn less , are fired faster and are more often bullied			1
he added that the idea that slimness equals beauty ' contributes greatly to the misfortunes of the overweight '			0
' if you look carefully there were or are stressful circumstances for fat people who do not seem stressed			1
but these people have found a solution			0
' they have become stress tolerant and in return , get a balanced mood			0
but they have to pay a price for this - eating			0
' there are anti-stress therapies which he said were effective in the longer term and could alter eating behaviour and lead to weight loss .			0

people who do n't eat when stressed are in danger , warns @entity7
thin people 's brains take nutrients from their muscles and organs
this is *riskier* for their health than being fat , and affects life *expectancy*
but fat people do n't have such risks as they are better nourished
