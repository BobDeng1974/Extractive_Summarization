@entity1 risks sleep - walking into a full - scale war by launching missile strikes against @entity5 , former top brass warned last night			1
retired commanders cautioned that an ill - thought - out attack against president @entity9 ’s brutal regime could provoke revenge attacks at home and abroad			1
lord @entity12 , a former @entity13 , general @entity14 , a former head of the @entity15 , and @entity14 , a commander during the first @entity16 , all warned of the ‘ unintended consequences ’ of a military campaign			2
lord @entity12 , a former @entity13 , general @entity14 , a former head of the @entity15 , were among those warning of the unintended consequences of a military campaign it also emerged that @entity21 was taking precautions against a possible @entity5 attack , including bolstering missile defences and handing out gas masks to civilians			1
a coalition spearheaded by the @entity28 , @entity1 and @entity29 is preparing to punish @entity9 for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week			2
defence chiefs favour a strike against important military installations , including airbases , arms dumps and communications hubs , using long - range cruise missiles fired from warships or submarines amassing in the @entity41			2
the hope is that the attacks will deter @entity9 from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future			1
but military grandees fear @entity49 and his allies might unwittingly escalate @entity5 ’s civil war into a regional conflict in the @entity53 , or even a proxy @entity54 with @entity56 ’s key ally , @entity57			1
@entity9 might also be goaded into retaliating against @entity1 bases in @entity60			0
and a missile strike might encourage extremists to bring bloodshed to the streets of @entity1			1
lord @entity12 , a former head of the @entity65 , said ministers should try to get @entity57 and @entity67 to agree to condemn @entity9 ’s chemical attacks in a @entity69			2
a coalition spearheaded by the @entity28 , @entity1 and @entity29 is preparing to punish @entity9 for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week the hope is that the attacks will deter @entity9 from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future he said : ‘ we are moving inextricably towards military action			2
a strike might be a rap across the knuckles for @entity9 but will that be enough to make him stop ? i have have very severe doubts			0
‘ if he is deranged enough to have used chemical weapons on his own people , which is a loathsome thing , what is he likely to do if we strike against key targets in @entity5 ? ‘ he might do something as mad as fire ballistic missiles against the air base in @entity60			1
that then becomes an attack on a @entity96 ally , an attack on @entity1 sovereign territory , and that means war , does n’t it ? ’ he added : ‘ politicians think they can control these things , but once you embark on military operations you can not predict what will happen			2
' we need to be very clear on our game plan – what , at the end , is going to make our nation and the globe more secure , and ideally help the @entity5 people			1
’ death toll : hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks , including many women and children calling @entity9 a ' thug ' and a ' murderer , ' @entity117 declared , ' history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator 's use of chemical weapons			2
' ' evidence ' : secretary of state @entity117 said images like these contributed to the @entity28 assessment that chemical weapons were used in @entity5 of any military strike ’s consequences , @entity12 said : ‘ @entity132 has said if anything happened it would unleash terrorist attacks , so you might have some reprisals here			1
’ lord @entity14 questioned the legality and purpose of the proposed military strike , describing the plans as inappropriate			0
he said @entity9 ’s probable use of chemical weapons , however wrong , did ‘ not constitute an open invitation for the international community to impose themselves on the internal affairs of another country			0
’ the general , who headed the @entity1 intervention in @entity150 in 1999 , said an intervention could result in ‘ fuelling the conflict and making it worse ’			0
would bombing @entity5 be lawful ? @entity1 and the @entity28 insist it would be , but the truth is far from clear			1
it ’s hard to see how @entity5 ’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country			1
what specific laws or @entity69 conventions might be used as justification ? the @entity163 allows for military action on only two grounds – in self - defence , or if action is approved by the @entity69			0
@entity57 has made clear its intention to veto any proposed @entity69 resolution authorising action – as has @entity67			0
can a military strike be legal without a @entity69 resolution ? unclear			0
in 1999 , the @entity96 bombing campaign against @entity175 was launched without one , with @entity176 and president @entity177 seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect @entity150 civilians			0
the intervention was widely welcomed , but its legality was questionable			0
a similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in @entity5			1
if president @entity9 is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people , he will be in breach of the @entity189 , an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which @entity5 is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons			1
but breaching the protocol does n’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts , rather than civil wars			0
does the @entity69 have a ‘ responsibility to protect ’ the @entity5 ? in 2005 , following the hideous atrocities committed in @entity201 and @entity202 in the 1990s , the @entity69 brought forward an initiative called the ‘ responsibility to protect ’			1
it was designed to protect the innocent from genocide , war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders , and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere			0
but former @entity69 assistant secretary - general , @entity214 , says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force			0
all diplomatic efforts must have been tried first , and even then military intervention requires the backing of the @entity69 – taking @entity49 and president @entity221 back to square one			2
does the pm need parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign ? technically , no. he retains the power , under @entity227 , to use military force without parliamentary approval			0
however , all recent major military interventions – including the wars in @entity232 and @entity233 – have been preceded by a @entity235 vote			0
the government has made clear it will ‘ respect the outcome ’ of tonight ’s			0
@entity238 , who led the @entity239 during the liberation of @entity241 , said : ‘ there is a danger @entity9 will retaliate against us			0
more widely , yet again people in the @entity247 world will say the @entity12 is dropping more bombs on the @entity53			0
' it might not heighten the threat of terrorism at home , but it certainly will do nothing to reduce it			2
’ @entity5 prime minister @entity254 responded to the threat of military intervention by warning his war - torn country would become a ‘ graveyard of the invaders ’			1
and a @entity5 army officer has claimed @entity9 could use kamikaze pilots to combat @entity264 forces			1
the unnamed officer told the @entity266 that , in the event of an attack by the @entity28 and @entity1 , the @entity5 army had 8,000 ‘ suicide martyrs ’ who would give their lives to bring down warplanes			1
‘ i myself am ready to blow myself up against @entity28 aircraft carriers to stop them attacking @entity5 and its people , ’ he said .			1
