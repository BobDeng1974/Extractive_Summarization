@entity0 believes he can turn around a @entity2 team odds - on favourites for relegation but insists he needs help from those in charge of the purse - strings – and more speed behind - the - scenes			1
the @entity2 manager could only name four substitutes for their 2 - 0 defeat to @entity14 at the @entity15 , including two academy teenagers , because administrative issues meant recent signings scrambled after a stagnant transfer window were not registered in time			1
travelling supporters chanted for the head of chairman @entity22 , who has only sanctioned free transfers and loans , after seeing the teamsheet			1
@entity26 and @entity27 , two players ineligible due to paperwork problems , watched the match in the stands with their fans			2

i try to make some choice based on the quality , on the behaviour , and on what i need			0
of course , i need a lot			0
the rest , other people have to take care about the money			0
‘ my ambition is to build a competitive team			0
if i ’m here of course we want a better future			0
for me the main problem will be getting more players in			0
i was happy that no one got injured , because they are all coming from different clubs so we do n’t know their fitness			0
