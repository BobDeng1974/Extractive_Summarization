@entity0 was offered the option to recall @entity3 captain @entity5 boss declined chance for @entity8 's international return three @entity9 lost @entity11 2014 opener to @entity12 , 2 - 1 by @entity13 on the journey home , as he reflected on what had proved to be @entity12 ’s winning goal , one wonders whether @entity0 recalled a conversation he had with @entity19 chairman @entity18 in the build - up to this @entity11			1
as reports of @entity8 ’s exceptional form for @entity3 grew more consistent and insistent , @entity18 approached his manager and gave him an option			2
if he wanted to attempt to persuade @entity8 ( right ) out of international retirement , the chairman said , he would make it happen			0
it was a well - intentioned gesture			0
whether he thought @entity8 ’s baggage would be more trouble than it was worth , or simply felt a sense of loyalty to @entity47 and @entity48 , the central defenders who had got him to @entity50 , we may never know — but the invitation went no further than that discussion			0
if , however , @entity0 believed @entity8 ’s inclusion carried an imbalance of risk - reward , he was mistaken			2
heads , you lose : @entity47 lost his man in @entity59 , who scored @entity12 's winner in @entity62 pain game : @entity47 and @entity5 goalkeeper @entity64 are floored after @entity59 wheels away to celebrate his winner @entity8 remains the finest organiser of a defence in the @entity70 game			1
there is no guarantee that @entity5 would have held out in @entity62 had he been in the team — but they did against @entity12 the last time , and there would be greater confidence about the reckoning with @entity77 and @entity78 in @entity79 if @entity8 were playing			1
still , we lie on the bed we have made now			0
refusal : @entity5 boss @entity0 turned down the chance to recall @entity8 for the @entity11 in @entity50			1
