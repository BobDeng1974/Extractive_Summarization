the @entity0 has said it would be irresponsible to rush through a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born			1
it spoke out as mps prepare to vote on whether @entity7 should be the first country in the world to sanction the creation of children that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father			1
the row surrounds a technique designed to prevent devastating diseases caused by faults in mitochondria , the tiny ‘ engine rooms ’ that power the cells in the body			2
developed by scientists at @entity26 , it involves swapping a mother - to - be ’s diseased mitochondria with healthy ones from an egg donated by another woman			1
the @entity0 has entered the debate on whether @entity7 should sanction the creation of three parent children supporters say the legislation would allow those living in the shadow of incurable disease the chance of having a healthy child			1
it is estimated at least 150 babies a year could be born using the technique			0
but critics argue that genetically engineering eggs crosses a critical ethical line , and argue that it is impossible to know if the technique is safe			0
now the @entity0 has entered the debate			1
it is particularly concerned that not enough is known about mitochondria ’s role in passing on hereditary characteristics			1
the @entity54 dr @entity53 , the @entity55 ’ national adviser on medical ethics , said : ‘ the @entity0 accepts in certain circumstances that embryo research is permissible as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect			2
the @entity54 dr @entity53 said : ‘ @entity63 does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics , safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer ' ‘ @entity63 does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics , safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer			2
‘ without a clearer picture of the role mitochondria play in the transfer of hereditary characteristics , the @entity0 does not feel it would be responsible to change the law at this time			1
’ flawed mitochondria can cause degenerative genetic diseases which kill in infancy			2
women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless			0
those backing the law change include five @entity92 prize winners , who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents			0
in a letter to @entity99 , they said : ‘ we believe those who know what it is like to care for , and sometimes to lose , an extremely sick child are the best - placed to decide whether this technology is right for them			0
’ but a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog , the @entity106 , urged caution , saying ‘ critical ’ experiments still needed to be carried out			0
tuesday ’s vote in the @entity112 will be followed by one in the @entity113			0
if the change is passed , it would not become law until october .			0
