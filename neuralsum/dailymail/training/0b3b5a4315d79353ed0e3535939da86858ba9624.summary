a tiny fly from @entity2 could wipe out @entity4 strawberries and other soft fruit , scientists have warned			1
at just 2mm long , @entity6 uses powerful saw like jaws to break through the skins of ripe fruit and deposit its young inside			1
the maggots then hatch , and eat through strawberries , raspberries , blueberries and other soft fruit , causing it to rot			1
scientists are trying to establish how widespread it is in @entity4 amidst fears it could devastate the local market and drive prices skyhigh			1
@entity4 's fruit industry is on red alert after the pest was spotted in @entity26 last year			1
it has proved impossible to eradicate elsewhere in the world the new pest has already spread rapidly through the @entity30 and @entity31 since 2008 , and was first spotted in the @entity4 last year			1
the state of @entity33 alone lost $ 300 million worth of strawberry crops the year the insect was detected			0
dr @entity36 , of the @entity37 , said : ' drosophila suzukii are different from the common fruit flies found in the @entity4			1
they are able to use their enormous ovipositor to break into fresh fruit and lay their eggs			2
if you are a fruit grower and have little maggots growing in your fruit , it wo n’t be marketable			2
the animal has already had a huge effect on the soft fruit market in the @entity30 and @entity31			1
' we want to limit the impact the animal will have in the @entity4			1
we want to develop a genetic system to control the spread of the animal - rather than relying on pesticides or introducing new predators			0
' slightly larger than common fruit flies which only lay eggs in rotten fruit , the males are easy to spot thanks to the dark dots on each wing			2
also known as the spotted wing @entity72 , it originated in south east @entity2			1
the tiny @entity2 fruit fly - the spotted wing vinegar fly known as drosophila suzukii - devastates soft fruit crops dr @entity36 and colleagues are appealing to the public to help map out its invasion after some areas in the @entity30 experienced 80 per cent loss of crop yields			1
they are hoping to find a biological solution to prevent the same happening in the @entity4			1
the fly , known as drosophila suzukii , originated in south - east @entity2 but reached the @entity30 in 2008 , @entity31 in 2009 and @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 in 2010			1
adult flies are brownish - yellow with black bands on the abdomen , up to 3mm long with bright red eyes			0
females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year			0
the plan is to genetically modify male fruit flies in order to ‘ switch off ’ genes essential for the development of the embryo into a maggot			2
the switch does not involve toxic substances or foreign genes			0
instead , it exploits a natural process of gene regulation			0
when the modified flies are released into the wild and mate with females offspring will not develop into larvae , preventing the species from reproducing further			0
the approach removes the need to use pesticides or introduce new predators to kill the insects , both of which can have unintended consequences for other species and the environment			0
they are asking for the help of budding ‘ citizen scientists ’ to set traps for the flies around the country , so the scientists can see where the flies have already made themselves at home			2
anyone can take a recycled plastic bottle , cut small holes in the sides and put a small amount of cider vinegar in before hanging it from a tree or the fence in their garden			0
fruit flies and other insects in the area will be attracted by the vinegar , and will enter by the small holes but will drown in the liquid at the bottom			2
people can then send the liquid back to the scientists who can check to see if any @entity6 made their way into the bottle			0
this will help build up a map of where the insects are appearing around the country			0
more than 50 people have already signed up to take part with traps set in @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
dr @entity36 added : ' having the public involved in this project is really useful as it will help us have an idea of where the animal already is in the country			0
it is also a really good way of involving people in science , and i think people really appreciate having the chance to take part			0

a 2mm @entity2 fly could devastate the @entity4 fruit industry , experts have warned
the fly has caused 80 per cent loss of crop yields in some parts of the @entity30
scientists are appealing to the public to help map its *outbreak* in @entity4
