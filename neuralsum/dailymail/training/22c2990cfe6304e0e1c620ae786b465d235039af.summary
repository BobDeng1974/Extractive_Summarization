@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			2
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
this week , @entity10 has his say on touchline bust - ups , why @entity13 should not be blamed for what is going on at @entity15 , and why @entity16 could have been serious contenders if @entity18 and @entity19 had been fit for the whole season			1
stop this touchline madness i may be known as @entity10 , but this technical area craziness must be stamped out			2
over the @entity25 weekend we ’ve seen more technical area spats and this is now obviously something that has to be addressed in the summer by the @entity29 ’ association and the @entity31			2
madness : @entity34 's manager @entity33 holds back assistant coach @entity35 losing his head : @entity37 was sent to the stands after his confrontation with @entity40 at @entity43 on friday and @entity44 on saturday , coaches of both clubs had flare - ups with their own players			1
at @entity47 , @entity33 ’s assistant @entity35 totally lost the plot in his reaction to the fourth official and was sent to the stands			2
this trend seems to be happening more and more			2
the demand for results , the constant speculation about managers ’ jobs , the increase in social media networks and scrutiny from the media makes the the technical area more difficult and high - pressured than it has ever been			0
last year , when i was in charge at @entity6 we had zero tolerance to any abuse or dissent towards match officials			0
not seeing eye to eye : @entity71 and @entity44 coach @entity72 have words on the sidelines squaring up : @entity43 coach @entity75 pushes substitute @entity76 clash : sub @entity76 was preparing to go on when he was confronted by coach @entity75 more often than not if my players got a yellow card for dissent they were immediately substituted			1
something has to be done			0
do n’t pick @entity84 i saw @entity13 ’s @entity15 play at @entity85 just after @entity86 and the team were absolutely outstanding			1
they moved they ball around the pitch , controlled the game and were always a danger			0
they were competitive all over the park and each time the @entity97 @entity96 , playing in the no 10 role , got the ball between the @entity101 lines he looked to thread intricate passes through for @entity104 to get in behind the defence			0
making the call : @entity13 makes changes from the stands by phone money in the bank : @entity15 owner @entity112 will benifit from another season in the @entity114 they had pace on the wings and they looked a quality outfit			1
@entity96 was their quarter - back and @entity104 was their wide receiver , running on to passes to damage the opposition			0
subsequently @entity125 was sold , @entity104 was injured and their cutting edge had gone			0
before then , there was a lot of talk of @entity15 nicking a @entity132 fourth spot			1
but they brought in no replacement of real quality for @entity96 and the players and supporters faced four months with no real goal to aim for and a comfortable mid-table finish assured			1
the owner , @entity112 , is £ 19million richer and the club is guaranteed another £ 120m from the @entity114 next season			1
from his point of view as a business it has been a great season			1
but if those two players had stayed together @entity13 would have once against been lauded as a top class manager			1
off the field what happened at @entity151 is obviously inexcusable , whatever the circumstances			0
but underneath , i ’m sure he feels very frustrated as he could have taken that team on to challenge the big boys			1
the supporters who want him out , should be very , very careful what they wish for			0
cashing in @entity160 @entity161 is a banker for @entity164 ’s @entity163 team			1
@entity165 turn : @entity167 's @entity161 scores his second goal to put his side 3 - 1 ahead starting young : @entity161 was a hot - prospect at @entity171 i ’ve been lucky enough to watch @entity167 three times during the last month and without doubt that boy has got to be in the starting xi when it comes to the first game in the @entity179 against @entity180			1
the 15 - year - old boy i saw playing on the wing for @entity171 ’s youth team destroying the @entity184 left back has now changed into an attacking midfield player , comfortable at the point of the diamond			0
he is superb at retaining possession , tracking back to help the midfield players and breaking out on the counter with extreme pace			1
he ’s got courage , self - belief and , most importantly at the top level , pace to get away from people			0
you could say @entity198 for @entity180 is a stroller in front of the back four , but let ’s see how he handles the electric @entity161			1
the wenger boys everyone ’s criticising @entity204 and wondering if he will get the sack or be moved on			1
if all his players had stayed fit , without a shadow of a doubt @entity16 would have maintained their challenge for the @entity114 title			1
welcome back : @entity19 has been a big miss for @entity16 this season i watched @entity18 in the second half at @entity85 shortly after @entity86 , and he terrorised the @entity101 left back @entity214			1
@entity18 had him running up drain pipes , twisting and turning him inside out			0
and he changed the game with his explosive pace and quality in the final third			0
running them ragged : @entity0 was impressed with @entity18 against @entity101 this season take out @entity19 , with his ability to break the line and leave people behind , and @entity225 , with his wonderful passing , it is too much for any @entity228 goes quietly about his business , without moaning and complaining and with total dignity			2
last tuesday , i was on @entity235 ’s @entity234 programme and i have to share this hilarious anecdote with you			0
as our show was coming towards the end , presenter @entity238 came on to introduce what was coming up on ‘ @entity243 ’ which was on later			2
i was watching in the studio as this beautiful lady announced the name of the fighter joining her on the show			0
‘ this is the best farter i have seen this year , ’ she said by mistake			0
i slid under the pundits desk in embarrassment , trying to keep a straight @entity254 place was in stitches			0
the weekend marked a special day in the history of the old dog			0
a year ago on saturday was the day @entity6 drew against @entity258 to win @entity259 and be crowned champions			0
it was an amazing , surreal feeling			0
after a jittery second half we somehow managed to hang on to get the point to take us to the title			2
it made it even more special that the team cost nothing to put together and that during the season we blooded seven young players from the youth team .			1

do *n't* blame @entity13 for @entity15 's poor end to the season
@entity161 can be @entity163 's main man in @entity277
@entity204 's title challenge hit by injuries to key players
