@entity1 's leading small business association has slammed @entity2 for showing ' an utter lack of understanding ' of the country 's entrepreneurs when he told them : ' if you 've got a business - you did n't build that			1
somebody else made that happen			2
' in a hard - hitting statement to @entity14 , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) president @entity12 said : ' what a disappointment to hear president @entity2 's revealing comments challenging the significance of @entity1 's entrepreneurs			1
mr @entity12 added : ' his unfortunate remarks over the weekend show an utter lack of understanding and appreciation for the people who take a huge personal risk and work endless hours to start a business and create jobs			1
somebody else made that happen			2
' he added : ' you did n't get there on your own			2
i 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because i was just so smart			2
' the inflammatory campaign speech comments underline the extent to which @entity2 believes that the state rather than ordinary citizens create jobs and wealth			1
they highlight a key contrast with @entity62 , the presumptive @entity63 nominee , who is preaching a message of wealth creation by individuals and reinvigorating the private sector			1
@entity68 , spokeswoman for @entity62 , told @entity69 that the remarks ' reflect just how unqualified he is to lead us to a real economic recovery ' and were ' insulting to the hardworking entrepreneurs , small - business owners , and job creators who are the backbone of our economy			1
' attack : @entity2 said in a speech in @entity81 on saturday that small business owners could not claim credit for their own success an @entity15 spokesman added : ' i 'm sure every small - business owner who took a second mortgage on their home , maxed out their credit cards or borrowed money from their own retirement savings to start their business disagrees strongly with president @entity2 's claim			1
they know that hard work does matter			0
' every small business is not indebted to the government or some other benefactor			0
if anything , small businesses are historically an economic and job - creating powerhouse in spite of the government			1
' the @entity15 was founded in 1943 and has some 350,000 members			1
it is officially a non-partisan organisation but tends to contribute heavily to @entity63 candidates			0
in 2010 , 25 of its members , all republicans , were elected to @entity115			0
@entity116 , executive vice-president and chief operating officer of the @entity1 @entity118 , said that the basic idea behind @entity2 ’s comments , and other similar sentiments expressed by allies , ' is really objectionable and offensive			1
' reaching out : @entity2 said in a speech at the weekend that governments - not individuals - create jobs ' the problem with the @entity2 administration ’s view , he wrote in a blog post , was that ‘ it only looks at the good outcomes ’ rather than what went before			1
mr @entity116 wrote : ‘ success is apparently a collective effort - but where was that " collective " during the periods of risk - taking and failure ? the vast majority of businesses fail			2
he added : ' every day millions of people put their lives , savings , houses and families on the line and work 20 hours a day just to grab their small slice of the @entity1 dream			1
where is the collective when all of this is going on ? and if the collective is really responsible for success , how come everyone is n’t successful ? meanwhile , on his daily radio show , conservative radio host @entity157 said that @entity2 ’s @entity161 remarks were proof positive that the president ' hates ' @entity1			1
' i 'll tell you what , ' he said			0
' i think it can now be said , without equivocation - without equivocation - that this man hates this country			1
he is trying -- @entity2 is trying - to dismantle , brick by brick , the @entity1 dream			1
' speaking at a campaign rally in @entity161 , @entity81 on friday night , @entity2 made the case that those who created businesses should be taxed at higher rates because they are fortunate and were helped to achieve success by the government and other people			2
' there are a lot of wealthy , successful @entity1 who agree with me - because they want to give something back , ' he said			1
' they know they did n't - look , if you 've been successful , you did n't get there on your own			2
plans : @entity2 recently unveiled a new proposal to raise taxes on all those who earn more than $ 250,000 , a measure that @entity62 contends will hit small businesses			1
' you did n't get there on your own			0
i 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because i was just so smart			0
' there are a lot of smart people out there			0
it must be because i worked harder than everybody else			0
let me tell you something - there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there			2
' @entity2 recently unveiled a new proposal to raise taxes on all those who earn more than $ 250,000 , a measure that @entity62 contends will hit small businesses			1
he continued : ' if you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help			0
there was a great teacher somewhere in your life			0
somebody helped to create this unbelievable @entity1 system that we have that allowed you to thrive			1
rival : @entity62 has stressed his business experience in his campaign ' somebody invested in roads and bridges			2
if you 've got a business - you did n't build that			2
somebody else made that happen			0
' the internet did n't get invented on its own			0
government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet			0
' he made the argument that all this showed that ' there are some things we do better together ' and was how the @entity1 middle class was built			2
as president @entity2 comes under scrutiny for remarks that he made about entrepreneurs over the weekend , it 's not surprising to many that the president has never served in a leadership level at any private sector job			1
the president has held a number of jobs since the late 1980s , including editor , writer and professor before getting into politics			2
but questions have been raised about @entity2 's lack of business experience as the @entity1 struggles with a high joblessness rate and a frail economy			1
it was a point that @entity2 's political foes were quick to exploit in their attacks on monday			2
@entity279 gov @entity278 , appearing alongside @entity62 today , said : ' we have a president who had n't run anything before he was in the @entity283			1
' he added : ' [ @entity2 is the ] most liberal and incompetent president since @entity286			1
' ' that 's how we sent a man to the moon			0
we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people , and that 's the reason i 'm running for president - because i still believe in that idea			2
you 're not on your own , we 're in this together			0
' @entity2 , who was speaking in a fire station , tried to equate the economy with state - run emergency services			1
' there are some things , just like fighting fires , we do n't do on our own			0
i mean , imagine if everybody had their own fire service			0
that would be a hard way to organize fighting fires			0
' @entity2 's comments strongly echo controversial remarks made by @entity315 , a liberal darling and candidate for the @entity318 in @entity319 , in august 2011 when she said : ' there is nobody in this country who got rich on his own			1
' she then made the case that the wealthy only got wealthy because of others			0
' you built a factory out there ? good for you			0
but i want to be clear : you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for ; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate ; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for			0
' you did n't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory , and hire someone to protect against this , because of the work the rest of us did			0
' she linked this with a demand for the rich to be taxed at a higher rate			0
' now look , you built a factory and it turned into something terrific , or a great idea ? @entity357 bless			0
keep a big hunk of it			0
but part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along			0
' in the past : @entity2 is pictured in @entity367 's @entity366 in this 1980s photo , taken at the time that he was a student at @entity369 video : @entity2 attacks @entity62 's history of outsourcing jobs from @entity1 ...			1
