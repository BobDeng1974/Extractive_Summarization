@entity0 thought that proposing to his girlfriend @entity1 underwater during a scuba dive would be an unforgettable romantic gesture - but it almost had a tragic ending when she was so surprised she nearly drowned			1
luckily , instructors were on hand to help the shocked woman recover , and when she had regained her composure she accepted the proposal			0
mr @entity0 , 27 , and @entity12 , 26 , from @entity13 , were on holiday in the @entity16 resort of @entity17 in august last year when he decided to propose			1
when they were 40ft below the surface of the water , mr @entity0 showed the card to @entity12 - making her gasp and filling her mask with water			1
the instructors helped ensure that she was safe , then handed her another laminated card to give her response as mr @entity0 held out a diamond ring			1
after she accepted the proposal , the newly engaged couple returned to dry land , where they were greeted by a crowd of well - wishers			2
shock : miss @entity1 gasped and let water into her mask , casing her to start choking ' we had mentioned marriage before but i had no idea he was going to do it then , ' @entity12 said			1
' we had never been scuba diving before so it was a once in a lifetime chance really			0
' we had air tanks and masks on and were both waving at a camera while posing with the fish			0
' then there was a tap on my shoulder			0
i turned to see my other half with a blackboard bearing the hand - written message " will you marry me ? " ' the guide quickly handed me a board which had " yes " on one side			2
i turned it over to check but it said " yes " on both sides ! ' it was literally completely out of the blue			0
we were told by the instructors before " do n't breath though your nose " , but when he proposed i definitely did and suddenly everything filled up with water			1
helping out : an instructor stepped in to ensure that @entity12 was safe and re-adjust her mask rock : mr @entity0 held out a diamond engagement ring as a scuba diving instructor looked on ' luckily we had the instructors on hand because they were all in on it			1
they sorted me out and we got back to the boat			0
' it was scary when the mask filled up with water but there so many people around us it was over quickly			1
' the instructors all seemed to know what they were doing , and slipped the ring to @entity0 while they fixed my mask			1
' once i was capable of breathing again , i saw the ring and @entity0 put it on my finger			2
i still ca n't believe that is how he decided to propose			0
' mr @entity0 , a kitchen manufacturer who was on his first holiday abroad , described how he was inspired to think up his unusual proposal			2
unusual : the scene 40ft below the surface of the sea was witnessed by a number of passing fishes ' i was originally going to propose to @entity1 over dinner , or on the beach , ' he said			2
' but then i got a bit creative			0
' i had bought the ring before we set off on holiday			2
and when i went to book the scuba diving trip , it got me thinking			0
i drew up the signs with the instructors beforehand			0
' @entity1 needed some help with her mask after she saw the sign			1
she had water in her goggles but i knew she would be ok			0
' the couple - who met on a night out in @entity13 a year ago - plan to get married in september 2015			1
but @entity12 , a customer services manager , has already got her dream dress after winning a contest to find the couple with the best proposal story .			0
