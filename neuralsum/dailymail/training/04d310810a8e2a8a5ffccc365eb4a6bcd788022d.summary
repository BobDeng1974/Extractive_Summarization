' obamacare architect ' @entity0 formally apologized to @entity2 and the @entity4 people on tuesday for his ' glib , thoughtless , and sometimes downright insulting comments ' about the fashion in which health care reform was passed in @entity2 and the intelligence of the @entity4 people			1
' in some cases i made uniformed and glib comments about the political process behind healthcare reform			0
i 'm not an expert on politics , and my tone implied i was , which is wrong , ' @entity0 told a @entity20 committee			1
' in other cases i simply made mean and insulting comments which are uncalled for in any context			0
i sincerely apologize for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion , ' the economist testified			0
@entity0 denied that he did anything more than provide economic advice to @entity2 and the @entity31 administration during the creation of the health care law and pleaded with lawmakers , who used the hearing to rub his comments in his face , not to allow his hubris to sully their view of the health care law			1
' it is never appropriate to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others			0
i knew better , i know better , i 'm embarrassed , and i 'm sorry			0
' @entity0 , an economist and @entity56 professor , came into the national spotlight this fall after videos surfaced of him asserting that @entity60 intentionally deceived the @entity4 people during the health care reform debate			1
two critical videos of @entity0 riffing on @entity63 at an academic conference have rankled @entity65 , who have long claimed that the @entity63 should be gutted and replaced with ' commonsense ' legislation			1
in one he said the law was purposefully written in a ' very tortured way ' so it would n't be counted as a tax			0
in another he claimed ' lack of transparency is a huge political advantage			0
' ' and basically , call it the stupidity of the @entity4 voter or whatever , but basically that was really , really critical to get the thing to pass , ' he added			0
at a @entity79 hearing that was to be the swan song for the committee 's fiery chair , @entity83 rep. @entity83 , the @entity85 congressman called the statements ' troubling ' and said they were ' not only an insult to the @entity4 people but revealed a pattern of intentional misleading the public about the true impact and nature of @entity63			1
' he later asked the economics professor point blank : ' are you stupid ? does @entity56 employee stupid people ? ' when @entity0 answered in the negative , @entity83 said , ' ok , so you 're a smart man , who said some really stupid things			1
' the @entity65 congressman , stepping down as head of the powerful committee at the end of the current legislative session , set to end this week , shoved @entity0 's comments back in his face during tuesday 's hearing and played the damning clip on the ' stupidity ' of @entity4 for the committee			1
confronted with his own contentious words , @entity0 smiled and laughed awkwardly as all eyes turned to him			2
but when it came time for him to testify , @entity0 apologized profusely			2
accompanying @entity0 at today 's hearing was @entity117 administrator @entity116			2
@entity116 's agency , located within the @entity119 , is responsible for the implementation of the health care bill			1
at the last minute @entity60 asked that a witness , a @entity123 resident named @entity124 , who was scheduled to be on a secondary panel be seated at the table with the key witnesses			0
after first denying the minority party 's request , @entity83 relented and asked the government witnesses if they minded having @entity124 at the table			0
' i understand he is a waiter at a local restaurant that thoroughly loves @entity63 , ' @entity83 snarked before stating that @entity134 is ' actually an independent consultant			2
' ' they gave him a new title , ' he snidely said			0
in making his opening remarks @entity60 rep. @entity138 lamented that throughout the last @entity140 held 29 hearings on @entity63 and ' not one ' was about how to implement the law			1
just think ' what we could have accomplished had we devoted that same amount of time and resources to more constructive efforts , ' he told his colleagues			0
' so i mourn what could have been			0
' @entity152 said that today 's hearing appeared to be no different			0
' as far as i can tell we are here to beat up on @entity0 for stupid , i mean absolutely stupid , comments he made over the past few years , and then grill , and grill , @entity157 , ' he said			1
' this may be good political theater , but it will not help a single @entity4 get health @entity162 will not help a single person get well , it will not help a single person get the care that they need			2
' the @entity168 congressman took advantage of the opportunity , however , to state for the record that he was ' extremely frustrated ' with @entity0 's statements			2
' they were irresponsible , incredibly disrespectful and did not reflect reality , and they were indeed insulting , ' the @entity168 congressman said			0
growing angry , @entity138 said that @entity0 does not speak for him or other committee chairs who directly worked on the health care law			1
' worst of all dr. @entity0 's statements gave @entity65 a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down @entity63 and eliminate health care for millions of @entity4 , ' he said , noting that ' many @entity65 now allege some kind of @entity60 conspiracy			1
' @entity138 said such an assessment is ' completely wrong , ' he said , as is the idea that @entity0 lied to aid @entity60			2
the @entity60 congressman pointed out that former @entity65 presidential nominee and @entity47 governor @entity49 had also praised @entity0 's work in the past .			1

' i 'm not an expert on politics , and my tone implied i was , which is wrong , ' he told a @entity20 committee
@entity0 denied that he was the ' architect ' of either the @entity47 health care law of the @entity63
the @entity65 chairman of the committee asked the economics professor point blank : ' are you stupid ? does @entity56 employee stupid people ? '
the ranking *member* said @entity0 ' gave @entity65 a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down @entity63 '
