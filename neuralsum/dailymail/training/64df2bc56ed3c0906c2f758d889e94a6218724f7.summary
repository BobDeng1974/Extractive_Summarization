the release of the @entity1 was eagerly anticipated all around the world			1
but one @entity4 fan went to great lengths to ensure he was the first to get his hands on one , by changing time zones and flying down to @entity8 for the launch ... just so he could drop the first @entity1 6 in a pitcher of beer			1
@entity13 based musician @entity12 spent 22 hours on a plane so he could be the first to buy an iphone in @entity16 , even paying the first people in the queue of 2,000 to hand over their handset			1
but it was no accident that the first @entity21 met such a sticky ending , mr @entity12 dropped it into his beer on purpose			2
as part of a clever marketing ploy , the musician was working to promote a product that claims to revive phones even when they have been completely saturated			2
@entity29 tasked mr @entity12 with acquiring the first @entity1 6 on the market , so he could test out the product with a fun video			1
so he headed to @entity8 , which was the first country to welcome the release date of september 19 , due to time zone differences			2
beer time : mr @entity12 pours the beer into his pitcher as he prepares to drop his @entity1 6 into the liquid expensive drop : mr @entity12 then drops the world 's first @entity1 6 into his pitcher of beer mr @entity12 is the lead signer of a @entity43 called @entity44 and a good friend of the production company that filmed the @entity29 video			1
the video was shot from september 16 to september 19 and it involved flying mr @entity12 and two - man crew to @entity16			0
mr @entity12 said , ' when the guys approached me with this crazy and beautiful idea , i had to go with it			0
what 's funny is that nothing was guaranteed			0
would we get to the store on time ? would we get the first phone ? of course , we were confident @entity29 would bring the @entity1 back to life , but it was all a big gamble ... those four days were totally hectic , and boy did we have fun ! ' dying : the @entity21 is placed in the pitcher where it quickly dies and the lights fade out second chance : moments later mr @entity12 takes the phone out of the pitcher and introduces @entity71 on the day of the @entity1 release mr @entity12 is taken aback by the length of the queue and he says , ' o wow , that line keeps going , you just ca n't see the end of that line from here			1
' during the entertaining video mr @entity12 comes to an agreement with the first two people in line for the @entity1 and he agrees to give his new friends thousands of dollars in return for the world 's first @entity1			1
the video then cuts to the morning of the @entity1 release and an excited mr @entity12			2
he says , ' our friends are being interviewed because they were the first in line but what they do n't know is the first phone is mine			0
' when mr @entity12 finally gets his hands on the @entity1 6 he kisses it and says , ' thank you very much everybody , that one 's mine			1
we came a long way for that b * * * * * d. ' drying : after he takes it out of the @entity71 pouch he leaves it outside to dry for 24 hours minutes later the musician can be seen in a hotel with a large jug of beer and his actions would undoubtedly shock most @entity1 enthusiasts			1
mr @entity12 says , ' ladies and gentlemen i 'm now going to drop the world 's first @entity1 6 into a full pitcher of beer			1
as he drops the electronic device he says , ' two thousand people lined up for this thing just then and we 've just dropped it in beer ? although the phone looks doomed as the display lights are extinguished as the beer infiltrates the device mr @entity12 then introduces the @entity124			2
test : after the drying period mr @entity12 then takes it back inside and attempts to switch it on success : the apple logo lights up and following the @entity29 intervention the phone is working again he says , ' when you drop your phone in water or beer or whatever it 's not the liquid that makes the thing die , it 's the minerals in the liquid and somehow this stuff treats the minerals and works on the minerals			2
i do n't know i 'm not a scientist			0
' mr @entity12 continues : ' you pour the liquid into the pouch and then stick the phone in and seal it			0
you leave this thing in for seven minutes and then you take it out and leave it to dry for 24 hours and you 're good to go			0
the video then cuts to mr @entity12 24 hours later as he checks if the phone has been revived			0
' this thing has been sitting outside for 24 hours drying and it is dry so i guess i 'll turn it on			0
' the lead singer is delighted to see the phone lights up			0
he adds , ' please look at that , please , look at the apple and please see that that works			0
