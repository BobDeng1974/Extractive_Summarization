they 're a horrid pest that 's been spreading across that country since the 1930s , with more than 200 million believed to be on the ground destroying native species and damaging the environment			0
but could the struggle to control them be as easy as getting the creatures on our menus ? professor @entity12 from the @entity13 thinks so , and says the toads are actually a really good source of protein			1
prof @entity12 is doing his latest research of how we can eat these ' ghastly evasives ' , as he describes them , and says a regulated industry in @entity21 would not just provide an economic benefit but also health benefits			1
a @entity27 researcher says eating the pest and exporting them is a way of the future ' @entity34 are a good source of export product , there are huge interest from countries like @entity39 to export them , it could be a tangible export product			1
' he said currently many parts of @entity42 and @entity43 eat frogs and numbers are starting to dwindle so an export industry in cane toads would be vastly beneficial for @entity21 , because we has so many			1
the toads are also in high demand in some countries where they extract the poison to be used in medical procedures			2
ingredients * 8 @entity57 legs with skin removed * 2 tablespoons of butter * 3 cloves of garlic * @entity62 * @entity63 and pepper to taste method melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until soft			2
add toad legs and cook in butter until tender			0
serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette , drizzled with garlic butter and garnished with chives			0
' @entity39 have started to show interest because they were unaware we have a massive supply market of them			1
' and as far as eating them goes , it 's a no brainer			0
' it is a food source that you do n't have to farm because of the masses in @entity21 and it 's increasing , the source is already made , ' said prof @entity12			1
' the fact is they 're threatening our species and we know that mobilising people to kill them does n't work in the short term			0
' there are more than 200 million cane toads populating @entity21 and that number is increasing rapidly prof @entity12 who has eaten his fair share of frogs legs in @entity42 believes eating @entity34 is the way to go and will present his case to @entity21 cuisine at a regional food conference in @entity102 later this month			1
professor @entity12 says we need to start exporting cane toads as products and eating them ' like any other frog meat , it 's a bland meat but it is healthy with a good source of omega 3 and picks up marinade well			1
' he particularly likes a nice stir fried @entity34 and admits it goes best with sesame oil and ginger			2
' 30 to 40 years ago , we never thought we 'd be eating raw fish in large quantities in @entity21 but now we do , we just need cultural attitudes to change and we can get it into a niche market			2
' ' to get it into the commercial market we need to look at the viability and how we can prepare it to not get poisoned , practises need to be right and then we can start , ' he said			0
' but it really is quite easy to get poison out of @entity34			1
' ' you simply have to kill them quickly as to not stress them out and remove their legs and skin and wash them			0
' ' the poor @entity34 has an image problem , the poison is only in the shoulder area the legs are fine			2
' and while he does n't see the idea of eating @entity34 in @entity21 becoming a massively popular craze , he believes we need to embrace it			1
' it really is a dream product , it 's a winner on every front			0
' a group in the @entity149 called @entity150 - which stands for growing and understanding local produce have promoted cooking up and eating @entity34			2
on their blog , they said friends of the organisation which live outside @entity156 have always been keen on experimenting with the cooking of road kill , including snakes and wallabies and also had an interest in the use of these ugly toads as food			1
ingredients * 8 toad legs with skins removed * 4 - 5 knuckles of galangal * @entity170 chopped 3 leaves of @entity173 coriander * @entity174 chopped 2 large handfuls of kang kung * 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil * splash of soy sauce salt * @entity63 and pepper method @entity183 sesame seed oil in a wok on a medium heat			0
@entity187 toad legs for a couple minutes , add galangal and coriander , season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes stirring continuously			0
add kang kung and mix with plash of soy sauce until stems cooked			0
they included several recipes which have been tired and tested by the @entity150 team including @entity34 marinated in soy , ginger , garlic and chilli			2
how about a salad of toad legs with @entity205 and @entity206 and canapes with garlic butter ? they also suggested the most humane way to catch them was by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag and then freeze them			0
@entity150 says you do n't want to stress them out so just pop them in the freezer and when you want to cook them , thaw them out and take a meat clever to chop off their legs			0
cane toads are a good source of protein and omega 3 stir fry @entity34 ? ? a @entity27 researcher says we should be eating these ugly critters and exporting them internationally			1

a @entity27 professor says *putting* @entity34 on our menus will have both economic and health benefits
prof @entity12 says cane toads are also a viable export product , with countries like @entity39 showing interest
he says toads are an easy food source because they are in the masses in @entity21
cane toads are a good source of omega 3
