mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug @entity4 if they get splashed with mud , doctors warned today			1
medics at @entity8 say they treated a 23 - year - old cyclist for an e.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting , abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea			1
the man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables , nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. a man was treated for @entity20 which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a @entity24 event and was splashed with infected mud ( file picture ) but eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet , muddy tracks in eastern @entity31			1
he , along with other competitors , had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight , and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race			1
it is thought this was how he became infected with the bug , which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry			1
the man said he had taken part in a ' @entity24 ' event , which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools			0
the cyclist , who has not been identified , recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the @entity55			2
writing in the research paper , the doctors warned : ' @entity59 endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high - risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with @entity20 0157			1
' this case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of @entity4 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events			2
' escherichia coli , often known as @entity20 , are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals , including humans			2
most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness			0
most cases of @entity20 food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef ( particularly mince , burgers and meatballs ) or drinking unpasteurised milk			0
the incubation period for food poisoning caused by @entity20 is usually 3 - 4 days , but it 's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear ( up to two weeks )			0
source : @entity97 dr @entity98 , consultant physician in @entity99 and @entity100 at @entity8 and co-author of the journal article , said : ' we know that @entity4 survives well in cattle faeces			0
' this case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces			1
' splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible			0
' @entity4 , which lives in the gut of animals , is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water			0
@entity31 has a particularly high incidence of the strain , with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the @entity124			0
in 2012 , three people contracted @entity4 infection following a 12 - mile ' @entity24 ' event at @entity128 , @entity129 , which involved immersion or contact with mud			2
also in 2012 , a study of one of the world 's largest mountain bike races , the @entity133 in @entity134 , which annually attracts 19,000 participants , found that when mudguards were attached to bikes , there were fewer cases of gastrointestinal illness			0
health protection @entity31 warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up @entity20 ( pictured in a petri dish ) a health protection @entity31 spokesman said today : ' anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling - and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro - intestinal infection such as @entity164 - producing @entity20 ( @entity165 ) , more commonly referred to as @entity4			1
' one of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces			1
' our advice would be to follow common sense principles and if you have contaminated hands or face , take care that this material does not get into your mouth and wash as soon as possible and before eating			0

doctors treated 23 - year - old cyclist suffering vomiting and bloody diarrhoea
he had contracted @entity20 after competing in a cycling event in @entity31
had removed mudguards from his bicycle and been splashed with dirt
this is how he contracted the bug , which is found in animal slurry
doctors warn anyone coming into contact with animal faeces is at risk
