by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 23:46 est , 3 february 2013 alone : the charity started the search for volunteers to befriend pensioners after a study found more than a third of men over 75 battle loneliness a football match or a busy pub are perhaps not the first places you ’d expect to find would - be volunteers for the @entity14			1
but that ’s exactly where a manhunt for members to befriend male pensioners may take an organisation which is often identified with women ’s flower arranging or tea afternoons			1
the @entity14 ( women ’s royal @entity24 ) has launched the search after a study found that more than a third of men over 75 – around 200,000 – battle loneliness and spend 12 hours a day or even more on their own			1
these men are less likely to confide in their friends and family about their feelings and so may become increasingly isolated			0
the @entity14 believes the issue may be alleviated by recruiting male volunteers who can be companions to the over- 75s for social activities or to watch sports together			1
in its drive for male members , the organisation hopes to shed the ‘ women - only ’ image which has persisted despite the fact that it already has 6,000 men currently among its 40,000 members founded in 1938 by @entity49 , @entity50 as a @entity53 women ’s organisation to aid civilians , its women played a crucial role on the home front during the @entity57			2
the @entity14 took in its first male recruits in 1949			2
it now provides a range of services , including @entity61 , community transport and ‘ @entity67 ’ companions for those who live alone , for 100,000 pensioners and housebound people each month			0
@entity68 , of the @entity14 , said : ‘ we are launching a manhunt			0
more male volunteers are needed to tackle the loneliness experienced by many older men which can have a detrimental effect on their physical health and wellbeing			1
‘ instead of a lady popping in to an older guy ’s house for a cup of tea and a biscuit , a male volunteer who will go down the pub or to the football or cricket with them can make all the difference			0
’ the @entity14 recruitment drive follows research showing that more than 3.2million plan to start volunteering – many inspired by the ordinary men and women who were @entity96 at last year ’s @entity97			0
the @entity14 provides a range of services , including @entity61 , community transport and ' @entity102 ' companions for those who live alone			0
