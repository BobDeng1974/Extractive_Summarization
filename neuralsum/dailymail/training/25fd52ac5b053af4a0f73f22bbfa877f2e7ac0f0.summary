dressed up in a white , plunging gown and full make - up , i have already turned a few heads in the @entity5 bar in which i ’m sipping a cocktail			1
so when i see my husband @entity7 striding across the floor , i ’m confident that , for once , i should have his full attention			2
i flash him a beaming smile — yet he walks straight past me			2
i suppose i can hardly blame him			2
for while he has spent 20 years going to bed with a curly haired brunette , tonight he will be snuggling up with a blonde bombshell			2
at first she is not convinced the style or the colour will suit her face , but changes her mind as soon as it is fixed in place my conservative chestnut waves — perfectly appropriate for a 42 - year - old mother - of - three who lives in the @entity27 — have been replaced by a poker - straight , platinum blonde bob — and my personality has undergone something of a transformation , too			1
i ’m usually quite shy ( not to mention married ) but , emboldened by my new look , i find myself catching the barman ’s eye and smiling at strange men across the room			2
and the best thing about my new image ? in the morning i can go back to my conservative dark hair and avoid attracting the opprobrium of the other mums on the school run			1
for i am following the advice of domestic goddess @entity17 , famed for her dark , sultry appearance , who this week revealed the secret to her party look : wigs			1
short , long , curly or straight , the chef says she loves them all			2
‘ other people do paper hats at @entity56			0
i do wigs , ’ she confessed			1
‘ most of the year i ’m not a party person , but i love a @entity56 do , and go for it full tilt			1
’ while the celebrity chef probably does n’t need to watch the pennies , at around £ 25 per wig , changing your hair colour could be cheaper than splashing out on new frocks for the party season — and it ’s guaranteed to have far more impact			1
@entity69 , left , pictured with her usual hairstyle , and right , @entity17 with her recognisable brunette locks ‘ this is not about fancy dress , ’ stresses @entity72 , of online hair emporium @entity73 , where @entity17 buys her wigs			1
‘ she loves to go blonde for the night , whereas my alter ego is a red - haired vixen			1
you can transform your look in an instant without the expense or regret of an expensive haircut			0
you can spend the night as a feisty redhead or a blonde bombshell			0
you can be whoever you want to be			0
’ as someone who has never even dyed her hair , let alone experimented with dramatic cuts , i ’m a little nervous at the prospect of following @entity17 ’s lead and donning outrageous wigs			1
so will these five very different wig styles pep up my wardrobe for the festive season — or just leave me with one very confused husband ? @entity17 's platinum bob £ 25.99 , annabelleswigs.co.uk @entity102 ’s verdict : with her porcelain skin and chiselled cheekbones , @entity17 carried off this striking platinum blonde bob with aplomb			1
but i ’m not convinced the colour — let alone the @entity109 fringe — will suit my round face and double chin quite as well			1
i change my mind as soon as the wig is in place			1
to be honest , i ca n’t quite believe the swan - necked beauty i see in the mirror is really me			1
i ’m transfixed by how green my eyes look ( they are hazel but my colouring always brings out the brown ) and the cut is so modern and funky			0
it could n’t be more of a dramatic change from my boring hair , which just hangs there like glossy spaniel ’s ears			1
i ’m a middle - aged @entity129 and i love it			1
@entity7 thinks i look ‘ quite cute ’ , too — once he recognises me , that is			0
the @entity132 @entity15 tries out a long blonde wig - and her daughter 's assume she has dressed up as princess @entity136 from the @entity138 film @entity139			1
she says the ' @entity132 ' wig does n't make her feel liberated , but rather repressed £ 26.99 , annabelleswigs.co.uk @entity102 ’s verdict : ok , so now i ’m a living @entity142 doll			1
i ’m exploring my inner @entity144 — except i do n’t want to			0
i long to smoulder quietly in the corner as a bookish brunette rather than strut about like a low - rent glamour girl			1
it ’s just such a cliche			0
i do n’t feel liberated , i feel repressed			0
my husband and daughters do n’t see any of this gender politics			0
@entity7 says : ‘ i did n’t recognise you , ’ in an alarmingly positive tone , before asking if we can keep it			0
my daughters assume i ’m dressing up as @entity136 , the icy heroine of the @entity138 film @entity139			0
‘ you could go to parties and sing @entity159 , ’ they cry			0
it ’s the wig i want to let go			1
not even for a night			0
the @entity162 the fringed wig did not go down well with @entity15 's family who said she looked like @entity165 £ 26.99 , annabelleswigs.co.uk @entity102 ’s verdict : i have an adventurous friend who is constantly experimenting with fringes , but i ’m too chicken			1
also , i ca n’t shake off a sneaky suspicion it ’s a little too mutton - dressed - as - lamb for a woman over 40 ( sorry @entity162 and @entity171 )			1
my friends are complimentary , saying it frames my face and ‘ looks much more modern than your usual haircut ’			0
@entity177 , thanks ! i ’d wear it to trendy parties — but it was n’t a winner with my family			0
@entity7 , who does a double - take when he comes in to find me washing up wearing my new do , says i look like @entity165 from the @entity184			2
to be fair , it does accentuate the bags under my eyes			0
the final word goes to the children , who say i look like a witch			0
the family hamster this wig made her feel like a ' prim secretary ' and @entity15 says she would be traumatised if she had her hair cut and coloured in this style £ 26.99 , annabelleswigs.co.uk @entity102 ’s verdict : i look awful in this wig			1
the colour does nothing for me , the cut makes my head look smaller , my face rounder and my eyebrows look like two black slugs			2
i feel like i ’ve aged ten years , and wearing it even changes my personality — i find myself behaving like a prim secretary			0
@entity7 is even more brutal — he says i look like the family hamster			0
i certainly do n’t feel as feminine now i do n’t have any long tresses to swish hither and thither			0
no wonder , then , that my friends and husband are unanimous in their verdict to ‘ take it off ’			2
i would be traumatised if i ’d had my hair cut and coloured like this			2
the sexy school ma’am her husband said this style made her look younger and slimmer because her neck and shoulders are visible £ 76 , hothair.co.uk @entity102 ’s verdict : i thought @entity7 would hate this look			1
he has always been possessive about my long hair , telling me it ’s one of my best features			2
but he ’s the first to admit he likes this cut , albeit in a ‘ sexy schoolteacher ’ kind of way			0
he says it makes me look younger ( yay ) and slimmer ( double yay ) because my neck and shoulders are on show			0
my friends rave about the cut , telling me it frames my face and makes my eyes look enormous — always a good thing			0
but i feel i look too much like my dad to feel terribly sassy ( sorry @entity245 ! )			0
i guess if i wore this wig enough times , the length might grow on me !			2
