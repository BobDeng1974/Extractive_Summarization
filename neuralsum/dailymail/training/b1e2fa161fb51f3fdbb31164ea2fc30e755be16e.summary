@entity0 made a number of improvements to the camera on its @entity4 to make pictures look more professional , and a new patent hints at what we could expect from the camera on future versions of the phone			1
the patent details a system capable of capturing low - resolution images that can be refocused even after they ’ve been taken and processed			1
it would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image , similar to the technology seen in @entity22 cameras , meaning the shots appear in @entity24 rather than @entity25			1
@entity0 's patent , pictured , details a camera attachment that takes images which can be refocused , even after they 've been processed , similar to the technology used in @entity22 cameras			1
this means images appear in @entity24 and the focus can be changed numerous times to create different shots @entity0 ’s digital camera , according to the patent , would be made up of a shell with an image sensor mounted inside it			0
this sensor would be fitted with a number of sensor pixels for capturing digital images			0
an adaptor , including a microlens array , could then be inserted between the imaging lens and the image sensor meaning users could switch to what @entity0 calls the ' low - resolution refocusable mode			1
' as the name suggests , the array would be fitted with micro lenses that capture light from multiple sources and directions			0
this is called light - field photography and gives the appearance of @entity24			0
these images would then be able to be digitally refocused because the camera has enough light - field information to change how it looks			0
earlier this week @entity0 confirmed it had bought @entity61 motion - sensor company @entity60			0
@entity60 was involved during the early development stages of @entity65 's @entity64 sensor			0
the company has n't discussed its plans for motion - sensor technology , but some experts believe it could be a part of the rumored @entity71			0
the set could also feature the camera detailed in the latest patent			0
according to patent papers , which were originally filed in 2011 , photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots			2
these images would be taken through what ’s called a microlens array			1
according to @entity0 's patent , this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high - resolution photo			1
a similar array is already used in @entity22 ’s @entity89			1
@entity22 was set up in 2006 but the first cameras did n’t go on sale until 2011			2
they use a technology called plenoptic imaging			0
each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions			2
this is known as 4d light field information			0
other companies , including @entity106 - based @entity105 , produce similar cameras and in may , @entity108 announced plans to invest in this firm			2
@entity0 's patent makes explicit reference to manufacturer @entity22 and its plenoptic camera , pictured			1
@entity22 cameras went on sale in 2011 and use technology called plenoptic imaging			1
each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions rumours suggest the investment will lead to the @entity126 phone maker launching a smartphone with a plenoptic camera by 2014			2
@entity0 makes explicit reference to @entity22 and plenoptic camera patents , however , by making the microlens array in its own camera detachable , the firm believes this would make its design more consumer - friendly			1
‘ this invention has the advantage that the digital camera system can be configured to capture both low - resolution refocusable digital images and high - resolution non-refocusable digital images ’ said the patent .			0

the camera in the patent is fitted with a detachable microlens array
it shoots pictures that can be refocused after they ’ve been taken
this technology is similar to the plenoptic system used in @entity22 cameras
when the array is removed , the camera is used to take traditional photos
the firm filed the patent in 2011 but it was only granted this week
