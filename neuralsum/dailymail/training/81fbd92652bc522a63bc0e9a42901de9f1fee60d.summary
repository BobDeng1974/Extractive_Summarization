a new sex club which sparked outrage after opening in a quiet city suburb without planning permission has been ordered to close by council chiefs			1
the ' kinky hotel ' , called @entity6 , is situated in a neighbourhood where many residents are pensioners or young families			1
it caused outrage when it opened in a former @entity13 rehabilitation centre in @entity14 , @entity15			1
anger : the ' kinky hotel ' , called @entity6 , caused anger when it opened in a quiet residential neighbourhood			1
pictured is owner @entity20 the property has been reinvented by owner @entity20 , who has installed two ' superbly equipped dungeons ' and a ' kinky room '			0
the building , named @entity25 , also features five themed ' playrooms ' , a ' uv room ' and a ' mirror room '			2
but a planning committee at @entity30 today unanimously refused an application for retrospective planning permission			1
they had received a 1,000 name petition and 150 letters of objections from neighbouring residents			1
a planning application report said the change of use had the potential to ' cause harm to the residential amenities and character of the area			2
' it recommended the hotel 's operations ' should cease as soon as possible '			0
despite the ruling , ward councillor @entity49 admitted it could be months before the hotel is shut down as mr @entity20 said he plans to appeal			0
councillor @entity49 , who is also the city 's leisure boss , said : ' this is a vital decision and signifies residents have won the battle and gone a long way towards winning the war			0
' if the application is taken to the planning inspectorate this could rumble on for weeks if not months			2
unassuming : club his boasts a dungeon , five themed ' playrooms ' , a ' uv room ' and a ' mirror room '			2
' but i would urge mr @entity20 to find an alternative use for @entity25 that residents are happy with , rather than going down that route			2
' the venue hosted an opening event in september , called ' couples and @entity75 '			2
running from 9pm until 2am , the party offered guests ' the perfect night for meeting other couples and single males / females '			0
the new hotel has replaced the former @entity83 swingers club , which operated 20 minutes away in @entity84 , @entity14			1
that was ordered to close after planning inspectors agreed it was being run illegally as a business from a residential property			0
and now @entity30 has vowed to ' fight tooth and nail ' to make sure @entity6 is also closed			1
but , the new venue 's website is already boasting a stacked programme of events throughout november and december			0
' we are simply opening a hotel which is also open to those who enjoy an alternative lifestyle			1
' @entity6 owner @entity20 mr @entity20 , 37 , said : ' i understand some local residents are unhappy about the arrival of my venue in the area and they are fully entitled to their opinions			1
' we are simply opening a hotel which is also open to those who enjoy an alternative lifestyle			1
' the events we will be holding do not attract large numbers of people , so will not cause any traffic or parking problems			0
' the average age of those attending will be 40 - plus - it is not going to be youngsters who may get drunk and be too noisy			0
' i will stress to all our guests that at all times they should respect the privacy of our neighbours , especially when leaving the venue			0
' he added : ' naturally i am disappointed with the result of the hearing but it did not come as a big surprise to me			0
' i fully intend to appeal against the decision			0

@entity6 opened in a quiet @entity14 neighbourhood without planning permission
1,000 locals signed petition opposing the site and council was *deluged* with letters of complaint
venue hosts swingers and features a ' dungeon ' for those with an ' alternative lifestyle '
