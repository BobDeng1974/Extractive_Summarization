' @entity41 is the @entity12 director , and she personally coached @entity9 on what she needed to do to qualify in @entity12 and skirt around the need to be actually from there			2

' could they have won ? @entity78 , @entity79 ( left ) came second in the contest and @entity82 @entity81 ( right ) came a respectable third in line to the crown small pond : sources say many @entity39 girls set up residency in @entity12 because there 's less women to compete against in the neighboring state nervous embrace : @entity93 @entity78 , left , and @entity94 @entity9 await the final decision ' i actually had an agent that was working with me in @entity12 a lot so i figured why not work in that state , and then i looked into the pageant program because i had done pageants before , ' she explained			1
' so i figured why not look into the one in @entity12 ? i really liked the way that it was run , the director that ran it , it seemed like a really healthy , well - run state program			2
so i decided to go there since i was living there anyway			0
' according to her @entity2 application , @entity9 currently works for @entity113 which has branches in both @entity53 and @entity49 but her profile with the company lists her as living in @entity39			1

all the girls were not only beautiful , they were smart , college - educated well - rounded women …			0
