the cocaine - using father - of - two targeted a vulnerable 81 - year - old woman in july this year who was living alone in @entity27 , the court heard			1
@entity1 was still on licence from a five - and - a - half year sentence for armed robbery			1
prosecuting barrister @entity31 said : ' mrs @entity32 , who is 81 , was in the kitchen when she saw the defendant in her back garden			1
' she asked him what he was doing and he said he could help her get rid of bags of rubbish and garden waste			2
she was thankful and said that it would be lovely			2
' he followed her into the house , was polite and friendly and started to help her move items			0
' he went into the living room where there was a sideboard and cabinet and told her not to follow him as he was behind the door			0
' the defendant stacked the bags in the hallway along with a shopping trolley and he asked if he could borrow her car , a silver rover 25			1
she agreed , gave him the keys and he loaded the bags into the vehicle			0
youth : @entity1 pictured leaving court in 1996 - around the time he was given his nickname ' but when he left and she returned to the living room she found that two display cabinets had been emptied			1
' old and sentimental value items - bone china tea sets , plates and dishes , glassware and a @entity72 clock - were gone			2

' but when i spoke to him recently , for the first time ever he has demonstrated remorse and is ashamed of his behaviour			0
' jailing @entity1 , judge @entity95 said : ' you committed your first burglary at the age of 14 and since then a variety of non-custodial disposals have been tried			1
' your criminal record is littered with offending of a serious nature - violence , burglary and drugs supply - and you have served four jail sentences			1
' perhaps this is not a case of a leopard changing his spots but more of a leopard disguising his spots			0
' you preyed on a vulnerable and elderly lady and stole items of sentimental value to her			2
you then took her car			2
' such offending has a damaging effect on the elderly whose feelings of vulnerability lead to helplessness			0
' she put her faith in what she saw as your goodwill and you deliberately targeted her			2

' i was very pleased and i went inside the house to get my purse to give him some money and he followed me in			0
behind bars : @entity1 pleaded guilty at @entity15 ( pictured ) to burglary , as well as taking a car without consent and going out equipped for burglary ' i ca n’t remember what i was doing , but he stayed in the house and was helping himself to what he wanted			1
' he took a lot of family heirlooms including a clock that my sister was very fond of			0
i was very cross about that			0
it made me fell very sick at that point			0
' i did n’t realise what he had done			0
i only noticed that everything had gone the following morning			0
' @entity1 's criminal career dates back two decades and in the 1990s @entity159 social services provoked national outrage when they started paying him £ 60 a week			1
at the time , the authority thought the money would provide him with the means to legally purchase the items he regularly stole			0
but the policy was condemned by politicians for paying what appeared to be a ' reward for crime			2

@entity1 , 33 , was a *teenager* when he was nicknamed ' @entity2 ' for getting £ 60 a week from social services to deter him from crime
however , twenty years later , the father - of - two was jailed again today for targeting a vulnerable 81 - year - old woman in her home
put behind bars for three years at @entity15 for burglary and taking a car without the owner 's consent
