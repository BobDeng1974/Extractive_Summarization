@entity0 believes @entity1 is leaving @entity2 too soon , but @entity3 has backed his former team - mate 's decision to depart			1
the 34 - year - old is set to announce that he will quit @entity2 in the summer when his contract expires , ending a 26 - year association with the club			1

@entity2 captain @entity1 applauds the fans after the 2 - 2 draw against @entity17 on thursday ' i think you keep hold of these great players for as long as possible , ' he said on @entity22			1
' you ’ve got to think it ’s his decision because they ’ll want to keep him , @entity14 wants that , you need that to integrate the old and the new			0
you certainly ca n’t blame @entity1 for where they are in the table this season			1
' but @entity3 tweeted : ' sad day for @entity30 & @entity31 football with the @entity1 news , i think it ’s the right decision all things considered			1
‘ leaving or retiring is a great confidence booster , this morning my timeline was full of “ why 's @entity1 starting ” now it ’s “ @entity1 best ever ”			2
@entity38 , meanwhile , praised @entity1 's fine career but also feels the timing is right			2
@entity1 made no mistake from 12 yard , scoring two penalties in a 2 - 2 with @entity17 on @entity43 @entity44 seems @entity1 is set to leave @entity2 at the end of the season			1
one of the finest players to have graced the @entity48			0
a top , top player			0
’ @entity50 ‘ @entity52 my words @entity1 is the greatest player to have played for # lfc sad sad day for everyone connected with the club			1
‘ @entity55 and @entity56 shone in great great @entity30 teams ... @entity1 has played in @entity30 teams that were at best mediocre and he carried them to trophies			2
’ @entity61 ‘ i ’ve been fortunate to have played with some top players in my time but @entity1 is easily the best i have played with			2
# gerrard # @entity30 ’ ‘ i think he ’s been @entity2 ’s best ever midfield player , the second best players they ’ve had behind @entity66 , ' said @entity38			0
' but probably i think the time is right			0
i think he ’s been a magnificient servant and one of the best @entity48 players ever			0
' the problem is where do you play @entity1 now			0
do you play him number 10 ? a defensive midfielder ? i ’d play him in a back three , which he is more than capable of because playing @entity1 in the middle of the park at his age you miss @entity84 ’s energy			0
