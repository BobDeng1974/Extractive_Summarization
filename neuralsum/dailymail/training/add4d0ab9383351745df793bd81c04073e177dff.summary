@entity0 believes @entity1 could retire from football by the time he 's 32 due to the amount of football 's he 's played in his career			1
@entity1 made his professional debut in 2002 as a 16 - year - old for boyhood club @entity8 and @entity0 thinks his former @entity11 team - mate may hang up his boots in his early thirties due to the physical demand of the game			1
' @entity1 ’s peak may have been a lot younger than what we ’d expect of footballers traditionally			2
age 28 or 29 has been the normal " peak "			0
with @entity1 , it could have been when he scored 27 league goals in 2011 - 12 when he 26			1
' he might be a player who ’d retire come 31 or 32 , given the amount of football he ’s played			0
' @entity32 has been on the go for ages , but he adjusted his position			0
can @entity1 do the same ? i do n’t think @entity1 will be able to play centre forward until he ’s 34 or 35			2
' @entity11 have been craving a creative midfielder since @entity0 ' retirement at the end of the 2012 - 13 season as the deposed @entity43 champions finished seventh at the end of this campaign			1

he ’s got all the ability to take over my old position at @entity11			0
' he has played some games there , but has never gone on an uninterrupted run			0
whether he has the discipline to do it , right now i ’m not sure			0
' should @entity1 retire by the age of 32 , his last games could potentially be for @entity17 at the 2018 @entity73 in @entity74			2
tucked away : @entity1 ( left ) scored 17 league goals this season for @entity11 as the club finished seventh			0
