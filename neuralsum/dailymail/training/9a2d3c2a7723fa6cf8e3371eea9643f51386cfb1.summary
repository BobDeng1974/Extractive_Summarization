@entity8 , colleague of @entity2 , is dating his widow @entity3
but @entity8 is already married to @entity1 , a friend of @entity3 's
the couple *wed* in 2012 and have a 15 - month - old daughter together
but @entity8 has now abandoned them in order to start a new life
*incredibly* it is not the first time @entity8 , 23 , has run out on a marriage
he was already married and had a son when he met @entity1 in 2009 but lied about it at the time
