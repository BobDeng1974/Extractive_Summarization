@entity4 is set for at least a ' few weeks ' on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury during the @entity18 ' @entity17 exit at the hands of @entity20 on tuesday night			1
the @entity22 midfielder had looked refreshed after playing a key role in @entity5 's 4 - 1 @entity25 quarter - final win over @entity26 on saturday , but has often been accused of a lack of effort in big matches since the turn of the year			0
out : @entity4 ( right ) is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring a hamstring against @entity20 injury : @entity4 ( second right ) was replaced by @entity36 at half - time in @entity22 @entity2 took to @entity37 to shares his view on @entity3 's decision to keep playing @entity4 throughout a difficult @entity42 spell			1
he tweeted : ' @entity4 getting a hard time			1
he 's obviously dipped this last couple of months and first season in a new league ( @entity47 football ) can take some getting used to even with the price @entity50 players can carry lack of form better than others			0
' his body language suggests he struggles and at the moment looks like he 's finding it difficult mentally			1
however arsenal are better for having him and he will return strong ! tired ? £ 42.5m @entity4 ( left ) struggled in @entity59 before being taken off at half - time ' and finally he will improve more when he has a striker that runs beyond and provides movement for his strengths			2
' some rightly pointing out others who have been up and down in the first season but then improved second and third			0
' every good num 10 needs 2 to 3 players that make runs behind and sacrifice themselves ! modern game problem - too many want to be a num 10 ! ' on xmas break - no excuse really for an experienced manager			0
he could have given him one first two weeks in @entity78 used to get one ! ' the 25 - year - old 's half - time substitution against @entity20 seemed like a tactical move from @entity5 boss wenger but the @entity83 has since revealed @entity4 had picked up a knock			1
killer blow : @entity86 fires home to make it 1 - 0 to @entity20 on tuesday mistake : @entity2 believes @entity3 should have rested @entity4 earlier in the season opener : @entity4 scored the first of @entity5 's four goals against @entity26 in the @entity25 on saturday @entity3 said : ' we have to make a scan tomorrow ( wednesday ) to see how bad it is but he 's out for at least a few weeks			1
i hope it 's not too bad			0
' @entity4 's new injury means the £ 42.5million summer signing will be out for @entity5 's north @entity101 grudge match against @entity102 on sunday as the @entity18 ' title charge begins to hit a wall			2
the @entity18 faced the difficult task of having to overcome a 2 - 0 deficit from the first leg of their last - 16 clash in @entity101 last month and bowed out of the @entity17 despite a spirited 1 - 1 draw against the @entity17 holders at the @entity112			2
well rested : @entity2 revealed sir @entity11 would give @entity9 ( above ) a @entity42 break @entity3 felt his side could have pulled off another shock result as they did last season , when winning 2 - 0 here , but bowing out on away goals			1
' our defending , our spirit was good			0
the frustration we had was the last 20 minutes i felt that @entity20 was very vulnerable defensively and that we did n't take advantage of that , ' he said			2
' we always missed the first pass , but i felt the situations were there where we could have made more of it			0
' at the end of the day we never got them really under pressure			0
