critics claim that the @entity8 deal could be seen by the public as a reason for officers to let criminals off with cautions instead of arresting them			0
@entity25 , vice-chairman of the @entity24 , said : ‘ even if there is no correlation between the extraordinary fall in detainee numbers over the past few years and this arrangement , the public would have a right to be deeply suspicious that the arrangement is playing a part			2
