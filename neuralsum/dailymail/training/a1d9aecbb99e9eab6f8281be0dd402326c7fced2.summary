behind the super-confident exterior , @entity0 is a romantic at heart			1
the things he truly values in life are beyond the reach of money			2
it is why the @entity9 scoring sensation insists he can imagine forsaking greater riches elsewhere to stay at @entity11 once his season - long loan is finished			1
all he wants for now is to concentrate on extending the superb form recognised with receipt of the @entity16 for october			2
@entity0 has been in fine form for @entity11 since joining the @entity19 side on a season - long loan deal the @entity9 international was named the @entity16 player of the month for october when decision time comes , however , @entity0 is adamant that the numbers on his contract will be secondary to the number of goals he could score in the right environment			1
an adoring audience is already being created at @entity30 , where fans have long been desperate to savour a forward with real star quality			2
@entity0 , as prolific in press conferences as he is on the pitch , has delivered sackfuls of the stuff since moving north from @entity38			1
the 22 - year - old ’s contract at the @entity41 expires at the end of the season			1
after nine goals in his first nine @entity11 appearances , every further strike will heighten demands from supporters to keep him in @entity51 on a more permanent basis			1
it will be no easy task			2
@entity0 is thought to earn in the region of £ 40,000 per week at @entity38			1
that is significantly more than @entity11 ’s best - paid player , but well within the reach of a middling @entity59 side impressed by his return to fitness and form			1
compromises will inevitably have to be made if @entity30 is to become his longer - term home , but @entity0 has declared himself open to all possibilities			1
@entity0 's current deal at @entity38 is due to expire at the end of the season ‘ of course i can see myself here next year , ’ he insisted			1
‘ you can always see yourself at a club like this			2
it ’s an amazing football club			2
‘ i want to thank the fans for being so kind to me			2
they put a bit of pressure on me last week by singing my name even before i scored ! ‘ i thought , “ s * * t , now i have to score ! ” thankfully i did , but i have to be thankful to my team - mates and to the whole club			1
‘ if it ’s the right thing then it is the right thing			2
i do n’t think money has anything to do with it			0
as long as you can put food on the table and support your family			0
‘ of course this is my job and you want to be financially stable , but you are going to be at a club like this			0
‘ you have to look at all the options and see what is there			0
i need to put myself in a good position by playing well			0
@entity11 want me to play well also and just focus on this year			1
it ’s my agent ’s job at the end of the season			1
’ two years ago , a virus attacked @entity0 ’s nervous system and almost cost him the ability to play football			1
inevitably , the huge stress of that experience — which left him hosptialised and cost him a place at @entity112 — has shaped his outlook			0
three seasons after an exceptional loan spell at @entity116 , the return of regular action with @entity11 has been a genuine delight			1
‘ for me , my dream is to play in the biggest games possible and do well , play for my country , win trophies and have a heck of a good time , ’ he added			1
‘ when you look back you are not going to think that was a nice day when i signed that bonus cheque			0
it ’s about saying , “ that goal was a beauty ”			0
‘ when you are talking to your three - year - old grandkids , you want to show them a nice goal on @entity134			1
‘ i would give any amount of money to score a goal and celebrate			0
it ’s the best feeling in the world			0
‘ the most important thing for me is just to keep getting games under my belt and to smash it — to do the best that i can , never stop and try to improve by working my ass off			1
‘ i want to embrace this year because i think it is going to be amazing			2
we have high hopes and i think we can achieve them			0
‘ to be told you might never play football again to this point where i ’m player of the month with @entity11 — that ’s a big contrast			1
‘ i never thought what i would do if i had to stop playing football			0
i would be finished as a person			0
me without football is nothing			0
’ @entity0 is keen on helping @entity11 challenge for trophies before making a decision on his future the 22 - year - old has revealed he dreams of playing in front of a packed @entity30 @entity0 has already boldly declared his intention to help @entity11 towards a clean sweep of trophies , believing the @entity166 should be targeted alongside a domestic treble			1
eleven years have passed since the @entity30 club last reached a continental final but @entity0 — ineligible until the knockout phase — is motivated by dreams of reprising the famous @entity166 run forged by @entity172 ’s side			1
‘ the boys told me all about @entity174 , ’ he smiled			0
‘ they told me it would be nice to go far in the @entity166 because , back then , it was unbelievable			0
‘ they told me how there were 30,000 fans in the stadium and 80,000 in @entity174			0
i just thought “ wow ”			0
the airline companies much have done well that week ! ‘ who would n’t imagine days like @entity174 ? i can even imagine being part of the 80,000 walking up the street singing ! i would like that as well			0
‘ my dream this year is to see a full @entity30 with 60,000 people			2
do n’t get me wrong , the atmosphere has been amazing , but i am shocked to hear it can be even better			0
‘ i want to see a sell - out and have goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck standing up when i score a goal			2
that ’s one of my goals for this year			1
‘ i am looking forward to everything			0
i have heard it will be a great atmosphere against @entity202 this weekend and a great buzz			0
‘ @entity205 away ( in the @entity204 ) will just be an amazing atmosphere , too , and i do n’t even need to talk about the @entity208 game			0
‘ these are the games i love , matches that are a bit tasty with a few yellow cards going around			2
