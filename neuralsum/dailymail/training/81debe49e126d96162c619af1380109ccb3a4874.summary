sickening footage appears to show @entity2 militants parading around 250 captured soldiers through the desert in their underwear before they are killed and their bodies piled on the bare earth			1
an @entity2 fighter claimed the men were from the @entity13 government 's @entity11 air base which extremists seized on sunday , potentially handing them warplanes , tanks , artillery and ammunition			1
the video , which has not been independently verified , is too graphic to be published in full			1
it begins by showing dozens of men being marched through the desert wearing only their underwear			1
it then fades to black , resuming with a pile of bloodied bodies stacked on top of one another			2
the chilling photograph was released by the @entity51 yesterday and tallies with other reporting as the horrific footage progresses it pans slowly across a vast line of men who appear to be dead , and whose bodies have been laid out one by one			1
the line forms a slow crescent across the desert , seemingly stretching to the horizon as militants stand beside it			1
eventually , after more than a minute , the cameraman reaches the end of the line			2
the precise death toll is uncertain and other sources put it at lower than 250 , but at least 150 bodies are visible in the shaky video			2
its description on @entity73 said it showed the execution of @entity76 officers and @entity78 people , a significant minority of @entity80 in @entity13			0
a caption to another version of the video said : ' the 250 shabeeha taken captive by the @entity2 from @entity11 in @entity84 have been executed			1
' @entity85 is the @entity87 name for soldiers loyal to president @entity89			0
an @entity2 fighter in @entity84 told @entity91 : ' yes we have executed them all '			1
marched : earlier stills from the video showed men being paraded in their underwear and ordered to chant before they were killed , the men 's captors chanted ' @entity2 ' - to which they replied : ' it will remain '			1
@entity2 won a week - long battle on sunday to capture the @entity101 base , which is 25 miles from their @entity13 stronghold in @entity84			1
@entity13 's authorities insisted at the time that their soldiers had ' successfully regrouped ' - suggesting they were later hunted down by the militants and executed			0
the captured men were escorted closely by @entity2 militants dressed in black and waving flags despite heavy losses on the @entity2 side , the base 's capture prompted fresh fears that the fighters have got hold of advanced military technology which will allow them to cement their self - declared regime			1
video footage has already suggested @entity2 fighters have drones which were used to shoot reconnaissance footage of an army base			1
today 's reported mass killing also underscores how the group uses images of violence as much as violence itself to terrorise its opponents , as it sweeps further into @entity13 and @entity131			2
@entity132 , deputy director of @entity133 for the @entity134 , described the video as ' another @entity32 war crime '			1
and yesterday a @entity138 commission accused the extremist group of committing crimes against humanity in @entity13 , similar to those it has already committed in @entity131			0
yet the extremists are also in touch with modern ideas of @entity147 , releasing glossy magazines in @entity149 which feature mutilated bodies to promote their cause in the @entity152			2
the home secretary has sounded fresh warnings over the radicalisation of young @entity156 , with authorities fearing around 500 have joined an array of jihadi groups in @entity131 and @entity13			0
extremists have declared a self - styled caliphate , a @entity163 regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of @entity167 law			0
it has opened up three fronts in the fighting in @entity13 , which is already home to a bloody and long - running civil war between president @entity89 's forces and anti-government rebels			2
captured : a resident of @entity101 waves the islamic state flag on sunday after militants seized the nearby air base death march : another video appearing to show the same march through the desert was put on social media there were chants of ' @entity2 ' , to which the men replied ' it will remain ' , their hands behind their backs tormented : at one point the men appeared to be taunted by their captors as some turned towards the camera today @entity195 claimed the militants in @entity131 have also been burning oil wells near the town of @entity199 , which is crucial because it is near a road which links @entity201 to the @entity13 border			1
the network suggested fighters are attempting to ' cover their tracks ' as @entity207 fighters draw closer			0
the @entity2 extremists now control roughly a third of @entity13 , mostly areas in the north and east of the country , as the @entity213 threatens air strikes similar to those already used in @entity131			1
but the situation is complicated as @entity217 has claimed the @entity13 government - embroiled in a bloody civil war - is part of the problem despite offering itself as a force against extremism			2
@entity226 president @entity225 added today that president @entity89 , whose forces used brutal force to crush what began as a peaceful uprising three years ago , was no ally in the fight against @entity2			1
sprawling : an image of what is believed to be the air base , just south of the city of @entity11 , shows its long fence @entity239 : campaigners say the base contained weapons and jets which may now be used by the militants some 43 @entity138 peacekeepers have been detained by gunmen in the @entity247 , near @entity13 's border with @entity249 , where fighting has raged between rebels and government forces			1
the identity of the armed group is not known			0
several rebel groups operate in the @entity247 , but the @entity2 group has no known presence there			2
the @entity138 said another 81 peacekeepers are ' currently being restricted to their positions ' as the @entity13 government denounced the ' kidnapping '			0
in a statement issued by the @entity13 @entity263 , the government said it holds ' the terrorist groups and those who support them fully responsible for the safety of the @entity138 peacekeepers , and calls for their immediate release			0
' the troops are part of @entity271 , the mission that has been monitoring a 1974 disengagement accord between @entity13 and @entity249 after their 1973 war			0
as of july , @entity271 had 1,223 troops			0
today @entity13 warplanes hit islamic state targets in the eastern stronghold of @entity279 and killed some of the group 's commanders , according to the @entity284 - based @entity283			0
the observatory , run by a @entity13 emigrant from his terraced house in @entity288 , said the planes struck a building used as an islamic state headquarters during a meeting of its commanders			0
@entity13 state tv reported that the army ' eliminated more than 10 terrorists ' in an attack east of @entity279 military airport , including two @entity2 leaders , and destroyed 14 armoured vehicles			2
another video posted online today appeared to show at least one @entity13 soldier being interrogated before a group of other captured men in their underwear			1
the soldier identifies himself as a @entity80 officer from the same sect as many high - ranking military officers and president @entity89			0
' how many have you killed ? how many have you raped ? ' the interrogator shouts			0
the soldier replies : ' none			0
i 've been stationed here in the airport			0
' the interrogator asks why the soldier had been fighting on behalf of @entity89 and did not defect , adding : ' we 're going to send you right back to hell by slaughter ' .			0
