by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 14 october 2013 @entity1 has reportedly struck a deal to sell millions of pounds worth of machinery to the @entity4			1
approving the move , the @entity1 government said to would not violate @entity8 's policy against arms sales			1
the gas turbine parts will be manufactured by @entity11 , a name associated more around the world with top quality , high - speed motorcycles			1
@entity16 : the @entity1 government said the deal will not contravene @entity8 's anti-arms selling policy because the gas turbines are ' not regarded as weapons ' the parts are to be produced for @entity23 , which has a manufacturing co-operation arrangement with @entity11 , and @entity23 will then supply them to the navy , according to @entity1 's business daily @entity28 and @entity27			1
' the parts are not regarded as weapons , ' said a government spokesman			2
' they are to be used in navy ships as well as in civilian aircraft and in emergency generators			0
' no further comment was available today as @entity1 is enjoying a public holiday			0
but @entity38 has pointed out through @entity27 that it has been making the engine parts for its own naval defence force and other users under license from @entity23			2
bike maker : the parts will be manufactured by @entity11 , a name associated more around the world with top quality , high - speed motorcycles the report in @entity27 said @entity23 stopped making the components for the @entity4 but when replacements were needed the navy ordered them from @entity11			1
the @entity4 , said the report , asked @entity1 's naval defence force to examine whether the export of the parts would contravene @entity8 's policy against arms sales			1
the @entity28 daily said @entity1 was looking to increase exports of such dual - use technology , which would help the the country 's defence industry increase output and cut down on production costs			0
not weapons : @entity1 's giant helicopter destroyer @entity66 was launched in august this year			0
under its constitution , @entity1 can not sell weapons to communist states , countries subject to @entity72 embargoes and nations involved in international conflicts ' such exports can also help @entity1 forge stronger defence ties with friendly countries , ' said the daily			0
a policy adopted in 1967 , and strengthened nine years later , resulted in @entity1 prohibiting weapons sales to communist states , countries which are subject to embargoes under @entity72 resolutions and nations involved in international conflicts			2
such ban , on the face of it , would seem to involve @entity88 , which still has troops in @entity90			0
but one country which would have no hope of receiving machinery of any kind from @entity1 is its belligerent neighbour , @entity96 .			0
