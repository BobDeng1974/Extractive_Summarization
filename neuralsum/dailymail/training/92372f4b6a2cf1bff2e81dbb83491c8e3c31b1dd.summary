embarrassment : home secretary @entity0 has admitted employing a foreign worker the @entity2 faced fresh embarrassment over immigration last night when it emerged that home secretary @entity0 uses a @entity6 - born cleaner			1
a day after immigration minister @entity9 condemned the ‘ wealthy metropolitan elite ’ for using cheap labour from migrants , his boss confirmed that she employs a female home help who was born abroad			1
the cleaner has obtained @entity16 citizenship and aides denied that mrs may played any role in assisting her quest for a passport			0
but the revelation came as @entity23 admitted that @entity24 helped the prime minister ’s @entity26 nanny get @entity16 citizenship			0
mrs @entity24 was named on @entity29 ’s application for @entity16 citizenship in 2010 as the @entity26 nanny ’s employer			0
in that role she would have been expected to support her claim for citizenship			0
a @entity35 spokesman said : ‘ mr and mrs @entity24 ’s nanny became a @entity16 citizen in late 2010			0
mr and mrs @entity24 did not write a letter supporting their nanny ’s application for @entity16 citizenship			0
the normal application process was followed throughout			0
’ a spokesman for mrs may said : ‘ @entity0 ’s cleaner is a @entity16 citizen but she was born in @entity6			1
@entity0 had no role at all in her cleaner ’s application for citizenship			1
’ but the fresh revelations will fuel the view of many voters that cabinet ministers are part of the ‘ wealthy metropolitan elite ’ criticised by @entity59 mr @entity57			1
and the details are likely to spark cries of hypocrisy among those who employ cleaners and nannies at the way ministers are prepared to criticise people who hire immigrant workers while doing exactly the same themselves			1
criticism : immigration minister @entity9 has hit out at the ' wealthy metropolitan elite ' in a speech on thursday , mr @entity9 said : ‘ for too long , the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour , or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services , but not to the ordinary , hard - working people of this country			1
’ the issue is particularly acute since mr @entity9 ’s predecessor @entity85 was forced to resign after it emerged that he had employed a cleaner who was working in @entity16 illegally			1
a @entity23 spokesman made clear that the @entity89 employed miss @entity90 not because she was cheap but because she was the best person for the job			0
the candour of mrs may and the @entity89 was not matched by all in the @entity94			0
the @entity95 yesterday asked 20 of its members if they employed foreign workers as cleaners , nannies , builders and home helps			1
however , the majority of those questioned failed to provide a substantive response			0
@entity106 mp @entity105 said they should come clean , adding : ‘ they should be seeking out @entity16 staff			0
we need every cabinet minister to declare what staff they have employed from abroad			2
’ @entity114 : he and his wife have had an @entity117 nanny and now have one from @entity26 who became a @entity16 citizen in 2010			1
@entity120 : ‘ i have a lady who has a @entity123 passport who helps us			2
’ @entity126 : the chancellor ’s spokesman had no comment , but @entity131 sources indicated he has no foreign staff			2
@entity0 : home secretary ’s cleaner is a @entity16 citizen who was born in @entity6			1
@entity136 : the @entity137 does n’t employ foreign workers ‘ at the moment ’			1
@entity140 : foreign secretary ’s aide responded with ‘ not to my knowledge ’			2
@entity144 : the justice secretary ‘ does n’t employ any foreign folk ’			2
@entity147 : the international development secretary ‘ does not have a home help , cleaner , nanny or a builder ’			2
there was no response from aides for the following : @entity156 , education secretary ; @entity157 , @entity158 ; @entity159 , environment secretary ; @entity160 , health secretary ; @entity162 , cabinet office minister ; @entity163 , defence secretary ; @entity164 , communities secretary ; @entity165 , culture secretary ; @entity166 , chief secretary to the treasury ; @entity167 , business secretary ; @entity168 , @entity169 ; @entity170 , energy secretary .			0

@entity9 *blamed* the ' wealthy metropolitan elite ' for rising immigration because they hire foreign workers at home
both @entity114 and @entity120 have home help from abroad
now it has emerged that @entity0 also pays a foreign employee
