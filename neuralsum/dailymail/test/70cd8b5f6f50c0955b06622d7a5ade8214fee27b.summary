police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in @entity4 , as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in @entity7 in the 1980s			1
officers from @entity10 's @entity9 released images of three suspects on saturday , but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader , likely because he has already been identified			1
meanwhile criminologist @entity15 said he has identified ' startling similarities ' between the @entity4 raid and novel @entity19 , by @entity20			1
in the 1986 robbery , the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend , triggering alarms on the friday that were not investigated , before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults			1
it was not until the week following the raids that police were called and discovered the robbers had dug into the vault using heavy machinery , in very similar circumstances to the @entity4 raid			2
criminologist @entity15 noticed ' striking similarities ' between the @entity4 raid and crime novel @entity19 , which itself is based on two jewel heists in @entity7 in the 1980s mr @entity15 , who also wrote murder novel @entity58 in the @entity60 , told @entity61 : ' there is obviously a lot we do n't know about the @entity4 heist , but on the surface they look very similar			1
' i think that when the raiders were planning their heist they must have read this book , or researched the robberies in @entity7			1
' while the robbery is obviously terrible for the victims , i think everyone can agree that this was a very smart operation , and @entity19 sets out a very smart way to rob a vault			0
' the timeline fits almost exactly , right down to the alarm being set off on a friday and the break in being discovered on a tuesday			0
' the @entity82 first struck in 1986 , when they tunneled underneath a @entity83 located along famous @entity84 near @entity85 , in @entity7			1
the gang , believed to number around four or five , made a hole in the wall of a storm drain underneath @entity7 's streets , before tunneling 100ft through the dirt , emerging underneath the bank vault			1
they then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ft - by - 25ft hole in the floor of the vault , before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes			1
in total they got away with $ 270,000 in cash , along with the contents of 36 deposit boxes , worth up to $ 2.5million			0
one box contained a sketch of a young girl by @entity108			0
the crew had stashed quadbikes underground for a quick escape , but the raid was in fact not discovered until the start of the following week when staff arrived to find the vault ransacked			2
police then discovered the tunnel , littered with ' an enormous number ' of polystyrene coffee cups , and surmised that the raiders were probably sewer or construction workers who had decided to turn their skills to a sinister new use			0
nobody was ever traced for the crime , and in 1987 the same group struck again , this time at a @entity128 in another @entity7 neighbourhood			1
in both @entity4 and the @entity7 raids , the gangs bored into vaults using heavy drills ( pictured ) , broke in over a long weekend , set off an alarm on the friday that was n't checked out , and raided safety deposit boxes the @entity7 raiders became known as the @entity82 , and mr @entity15 believes the group who raided @entity4 ( picutred ) must have known about them , or read the book inspired by them again , the group had used heavy tools to cut their way into a bank vault over the course of a weekend , and again they had set off an alarm on their way in			1
however , on this occasion police did respond , and they were forced to flee with just $ 89,000 and without cracking a single safety deposit box			0
it was only afterwards the officers discovered another tunnel underneath @entity152 in @entity153 , suggesting the gang were attempting to hit two vaults at once			2
mr @entity20 told @entity156 : ' @entity157 was a fictionalised account of a bank heist that occurred in @entity7 in september 1987			1
' in the @entity4 raid , the @entity160 have said the raiders broke into the building on the second floor , disabling the lift before lowering themselves down the shaft and breaking into the basement			0
the men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance , before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside			0
the raiders then broke into 72 safety deposit boxes , before making their getaway in a white @entity179 van parked outside			0
the diamond - tipped drills were taken from a building site in @entity183 , an eight minute walk from @entity4 , and nobody was ever arrested			2
police are probing the thefts of several drills in the months before the raid , including two @entity191 drills that were taken near @entity4			2
@entity193 @entity192 ( pictured ) has previously said @entity191 drills were used in the raid @entity196 also confirmed today that they have passed information to @entity10 about the theft of two @entity191 drills , the same devices used in the @entity4 raid , in december last year			2
in another development , @entity202 has revealed that Â£ 80,000 worth of diamond tipped drills were stolen from another site in @entity207 in november , using a van similar to that at @entity4			0
@entity210 , of @entity211 , revealed that the equipment could easily be used to cut into a vault , as his firm is often tasked with converting former banks into hotels and housing			0
@entity218 from the scene reveals that a white @entity179 parked outside his business for two minutes in november last year before two hooded men are seen walking past			0

novel is based on real - life bank heists carried out the late 80s in @entity7
@entity82 used drills to bore into vaults in 1986 and 87
