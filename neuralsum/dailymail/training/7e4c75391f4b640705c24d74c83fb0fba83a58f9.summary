despite admitting that she had her ' a * * - whipped ' by her lawyer and husband over her @entity8 activity when deleting her account a little over week ago , the speaker 's wife said that she was ' humbly ' reactivating her feed as she has learnt lessons and ' will not screw up again '			1

' mrs @entity2 closed her account on november 20 after her most recent high profile error - naming a @entity31 runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order			2
the breach prompted calls for her to ' turn off @entity8 ' to avoid any more legal problems			2
her exit from @entity8 also came just a fortnight after she used the site to name former @entity40 treasurer @entity39 following a @entity42 report which alleged a senior @entity40 figure from the @entity45 era was a child abuser			1
he was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online			0
it later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity			0
@entity39 , who settled with the @entity50 for £ 185,000 , is now said to be suing mrs @entity2 , although she insists that what she said on @entity8 was ‘ mischievous ’ rather than ‘ libellous ’			1
legal experts had urged her to turn off the account after she referred to the case of @entity55 , a 30 - year - old teacher in @entity56 , @entity57 , who was arrested in @entity58 in september after allegedly running away with a schoolgirl			1
he had been charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing a week before the tweet when the court made a section 39 order under the @entity66 , banning the naming of the teenager			0
reactivated : @entity2 tweeted last night that she has learnt lessons from her recent @entity8 gaffes on best behaviour : mrs @entity2 later added that she has her fingers crossed that her tweets wo n't land her in any more hot water gone : after several mistakes and calls for her to ' turn off @entity8 ' @entity2 's personal account had been deleted final tweet : in a message to her thousands of followers mrs @entity2 revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back legal experts said at the time that using a social networking site such as @entity8 to comment does constitute publication , meaning mrs @entity2 , a @entity85 activist , could face a fine			1
@entity87 , a media lawyer with the firm @entity88 , said : ‘ the contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster			0
i would advise her to be very cautious			0
‘ i would certainly urge her to turn off her @entity8 account at the moment			2
reference : the @entity85 activist was referring to the case of @entity55 , a teacher in @entity56 , who was arrested in @entity58 in september			0
he is pictured in october getting on a plane to return to @entity31 legal action : earlier this month she used @entity8 to name former @entity40 treasurer @entity39 , following a @entity42 report which alleged a senior @entity40 figure was a child abuser ' she may not know the law , but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that , you ca n’t go around naming them			1
i think it is surprising that none of these things seem to cross her radar			0
' some @entity8 users were delighted to see mrs @entity2 back on the social networking site			2
@entity121 tweeted : ' welcome back from the naughty step			0
' angry : @entity2 was sent a letter from solicitors acting for @entity39 ( pictured in april 1998 ) couple : mrs @entity2 's ( right ) husband @entity130 ( left ) , the @entity129 speaker , is meant to be an impartial character sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
