by @entity0 , science reporter published : 05:07 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 7 june 2013 the world of a @entity4 novel was a dangerous place for a single , young woman			0
not only must they fight it out for the best husband , but they are forever falling victim to a fever - usually as the result of something as simple as wet stockings or being caught in the rain			1
but now medical historians have claimed that @entity4 's hypochondriac characters did , in fact , have plenty to fear			1
with deadly airborne diseases such as tuberculosis much more widespread in the 19th century , being wet could actually have made them much vulnerable to illness			1
sensitive : an emotional @entity25 ( @entity26 ) falls into a ' putrid fever ' after walking through wet grass in twilight in @entity30 science broadcaster @entity31 , who is presenting a talk on @entity33 , @entity33 and the doctor at the @entity35 today , said : ‘ we may laugh at @entity4 and her heroines susceptibility to dampness			1
‘ but the reality is we still cling this idea that going out without shoes or going to bed with wet hair means we could catch our death of cold			2
‘ at the time no - one treated the cause , but the symptoms			0
‘ and death rates from infectious diseases such as @entity51 were very high , while four of @entity4 ’s sister - in - laws died in childbirth			1
‘ so women had every reason to be cautious			0
’ professor @entity56 , @entity58 ’s leading flu expert , said that in @entity4 ’s time , it was possible that a good soaking could leave a person more vulnerable to the biological infections rife during the period			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s possible to catch a virus from getting wet and cold			2
‘ what really happens in winter time is that we all stay indoors and huddle closer together making it easier for infections to spread			0
it has nothing to do with wet hair or unslippered feet			2
‘ but in @entity4 ’s time there were a lot of horrible bacteria around like @entity51 , and if your whole body got wet you could become more vulnerable to these illnesses , so there may be some basis in it			1
’ victims : in @entity33 , eldest daughter @entity86 ( left , played by @entity87 ) falls sick after being caught in the rain and is bedridden for days			0
right , hypochondriac mr @entity90 in the novel @entity90 worried : other characters in @entity4 's novels were famous hypochondriacs , including mrs @entity86 asking for ' compassion for my poor nerves ' modern medicine has dismissed the idea that a slight drenching could result in a life - threatening condition			1
but in fact , bizarre as it may sound , the malaises afflicting @entity4 ’s leading ladies may not be as outlandish as they first seem			0
with medical knowledge slowly advancing in the late 18th century , events that ‘ excited ’ the system were being linked with the onset of illness by the educated classes began			1
walking through the wet grass at twilight leads @entity25 to rapidly fall into a ‘ putrid fever ’ in @entity30 , while @entity33 ’s @entity86 falls swiftly ill after being caught in the rain on horseback			2
danger : @entity4 's characters frequently fell ill after being exposed to the elements in 19th century @entity58 other characters in her novels were famous hypochondriacs , with mrs @entity86 asking for ‘ compassion for my poor nerves ’ , while in @entity90 her father mr @entity90 refused to eat cake on the orders of his apothecary			1
professor @entity128 from @entity129 said the concept of nerves was also introduced in the 18th century , with ‘ nervousness becoming a disease of the @entity134 , particularly the @entity134 aristocracy ’			0
‘ they talked about nerves in terms of fibres			0
they had this dual function of communicating and motor function , ’ he said			0
‘ one of key ideas was fibres that somehow vibrated and people were highly strung			0
people talked about the tone of their nerves			0
’ as a result , in @entity152 , greater medical understanding resulted in hypochondria becoming fashionable , as the middle - class affected illness to emulate the cautions of the aristocracy .			1

medical historians say hypochondriac characters had plenty to fear
deadly airborne diseases such as @entity51 more widespread in 19th century
getting wet could have made them more vulnerable to illness
