' relief : @entity42 's mother was told she should consider aborting her unborn child after a rare weakness of the abdominal wall was spotted at her 11 week scan after surgery @entity42 is expected to have a good quality of life and her parents hope that her spina bifida will be correctable mrs @entity8 has to change the cling - film dressing on @entity42 's bladder every time she changes her nappy - about five times a day			1
cling film is used to wrap @entity42 's bladder as it reduces the amount of fluids and body heat lost from her abdomen			1
she said : ' it is amazing that a household product like cling film is doing such an important job and keeping @entity42 alive			1
' we have to change the cling film every time we change @entity42 's nappy so that is about five times a day			1

we keep rolls of it in our changing bag			0
' doctors have told @entity42 's parents it is rare to suffer from both conditions			1
bladder exstrophy , a congenital birth defect , occurs in one in every 40,000 births and affects two to three times more boys than girls			0
it is not known what causes bladder exstrophy , but the problem occurs somewhere between the fourth and tenth week of pregnancy when various organs , tissues and muscles begin to form layers that separate , divide and fold			0
the skin over the lower abdominal wall does not form properly , so the bladder is open and exposed on the outside of the abdomen			2
@entity196 , the other condition she suffers from , affects one in every 2,500 children born each year , occurs when a child 's abdominal wall does not develop fully while in the womb .			1

@entity14 , was told at 11 - week scan she should consider an abortion
@entity42 had rare weakness of abdominal wall , so organs were protruding
she grew in the womb with her liver , intestine and bladder outside her body
but doctors discovered when she was born that they were all working fine
is now being kept alive with cling film that holds her organs in the right place
after surgery to put her organs in the right place , she is expected to be fine
