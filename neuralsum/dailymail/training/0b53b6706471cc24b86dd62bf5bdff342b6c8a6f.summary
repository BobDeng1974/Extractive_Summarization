by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 19 january 2013 through the telescopic sights of their sniper rifles the marksmen of @entity6 ’s @entity5 watched as exhausted , frightened foreign hostages were pushed through the wooden doorway of the block where they had been sheltering towards a fleet of jeeps			1
some would have had a clear shot at the @entity15 kidnappers from the ‘ @entity16 ’ but no order was given to open fire when the convoy started moving			2
instead , heavily armed gunships opened fire on the speeding vehicles - hitting and destroying four and causing a fifth to spin over and to crash			2
’ it was a scene of carnage with bullets flying , explosions , fires , smoke billowing into the clear bright blue sky			2
' there were bodies everywhere , ’ one witness said , ‘ the @entity6 forces were firing at anything that moved			1
’ one was blown several feet into the air			2
few , if anyone , could have survived , witnesses said			2
patrol : @entity6 soldiers patrolling in the desert at an undisclosed location in the south of the country			1
this week 's air attack left 35 kidnappers and 15 hostages dead deadly : it was unclear whether the cars were struck by missiles fired from helicopters or by ground forces , but the air attack was deadly the horrific details of the immediate aftermath of thursday ’s assault on the gas plant emerged yesterday from @entity6 hostages and the family of @entity66 , of @entity67 , who was in the vehicle that crashed and had explosives tied around his neck			1
exactly why the @entity6 opened fired on 4x4 wheel vehicles packed with hostages and terrorists remains a mystery			1
the @entity6 said the kidnappers were ‘ making a run ’ for it but with the barren @entity82 desert stretching for hundreds of miles around the sprawling @entity84 gas plant , there was nowhere to go			1
amazingly , mr @entity66 a 36 - year - old father - of - two , was able to sprint to safety at the height			0
the electrical engineer told his family he had narrowly escaped death twice - first when bound and gagged by the gunmen who fastened explosives around the hostages ’ necks and then in the convoy of five vehicles driving across the complex			2
questions : the attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base , or an emboldening of @entity105 insurgents ‘ ( the gunmen ) were moving five jeeploads of hostages from one part of the compound , ’ his brother @entity106 said			1
‘ at that stage , they were intercepted by the @entity6 army			1
‘ the army bombed four out of five of the trucks and four of them were destroyed ... he presumed everyone else in the other trucks was killed ... the truck my brother was in crashed and at that stage @entity66 was able to make a break for his freedom			1
’ hostages were used as human shields as , in the space of minutes , the hostage crisis had gone from one of containment and negotiation to a bloodbath and running battles			0
dozens of desperate foreign and @entity6 workers had found hiding places when the kidnappers had stormed the complex in what appeared a well planned operation - their ease of movement and familiarity with the vast complex suggestion an ‘ inside knowledge			1
’ remote : the @entity149 gas project is located in the @entity82 desert in @entity6			1
although the desert complex was heavily guarded , it is vulnerable to attack due its lone proximity at least three @entity155 found a sanctuary in the ceiling of the canteen area only emerging yesterday when they were sure @entity6 forces had regained control of the area			1
one @entity163 hostage , @entity164 , who works for the @entity167 catering company , said he hid in a room away from other foreign hostages , arranging planks of wood to conceal his presence			0
‘ i stayed hidden for nearly 40 hours in my bedroom , under the bed , ’ he said			0
‘ when the military came to get me , i did not know whether it was over , ’ he added			0
‘ they arrived with colleagues ( @entity6 who worked with him ) , otherwise i would never have opened the door			1
’ bloodbath : helicopters began strafing the plant in @entity187 ( above ) this morning , hours after the rebels had threatened to blow up the hostages if they intervened @entity164 said @entity6 soldiers found some @entity155 hostages hiding on the roof and were still combing the sprawling gas site for others when he was escorted to a nearby military base			1
‘ they are still counting them up , ’ he said			0
many had been in hiding at the supposedly secure and well energy facility , which produces some 10 per cent of the natural gas on which @entity6 depends for its export income , since the militants moved - in on wednesday morning			1
anger : prime minister @entity202 gives his statement to the @entity204 on the hostage crisis in @entity6 today , and revealed that ' less than 30 ' @entity155 are still at risk from the terrorists survivors : four @entity155 workers who have escaped the @entity6 refinery taken over by @entity211 have spoken for the first time about their ordeal more than 600 @entity6 work on the complex and it became clear quickly they were not the targets			1
an @entity6 engineer , @entity217 , said : ‘ i heard gunfire , sustained shooting			1
then the guy who was clearly the head of the armed group spoke to us			0
he said he was called @entity223 and he said he would let us go quickly			0
it was the foreigners who interested them , they only wanted them			0
' the @entity105 left us our phones so we could call our families			0
but quite quickly it became impossible to contact anyone			0
someone told me they had freed the women , but i did n’t see that			0
@entity238 locates the @entity187 natural gas facility in eastern @entity6 ‘ the women who work on the site are mostly interpreters			1
later in the morning there was an assault			0
i was in the games room at the time			0
there was a lot of pushing and shoving , some people managed to open the security door , and we all just ran for it			0
’ another @entity6 added : ‘ it was clear they would not harm @entity252 , they wanted @entity253 and infidels			1
’ @entity255 , an @entity6 technician employed by @entity84 , said the @entity6 workers were held separately from the foreigners			2
during wednesday night , @entity255 said , he and his colleagues helped threee foreign members of staff escape through a wire fence into the safer @entity6 side of the compound			1
‘ we hid them and reassured them			0
the first skirmishes between the @entity6 army and the terrorists came at about 1pm on the thursday			1
‘ despite our fear , from the beginning of the shooting we decided to try our luck			0
we cut the wire fence with clippers , and ran for it , all together , 50 or so of us with the three foreigners			0
‘ we were welcomed by the special forces who were only a few dozen metres from the base			0
i did n’t look back			0
the only thing i saw was a plane overflying the site			0
the army frisked us and questioned us , then we were handed over to the gendarmes who took us to @entity187 airport			2
’ around 40 international hostages were taken and the @entity287 are said to have appeared confident and ‘ not afraid to die ’ as they made their initial demand that @entity163 military action stop in @entity291 and @entity6 stop allowing warplanes to use its airspace to bomb @entity211 - linked rebels			2
clearly , they expected expected to negotiate , @entity223 , the chief hostage taker , taking to the @entity297 news channel to tell them : ‘ we demand the @entity6 army pull out from the area to allow negotiations			1
’ mastermind : militant militia leader @entity302 - today he offered to trade two @entity304 hostages for two prominent terror figures jailed in the @entity304 @entity306 , who is now thought to have been killed , also used his mobile phone to speak to military commanders gathering in the area , saying he would ‘ spare ’ all those held in return for a series of demands			0
these ranged from @entity105 prisoners being released , to the terrorist gang being allowed a safe passage to neighbouring @entity291 , and an end to @entity163 military action			2
the @entity6 said yesterday the @entity105 were a mixture of nationalities - the 18 militants so far found dead have included three @entity324 , two @entity325 , two @entity326 , a @entity291 and a @entity163 - and in claims certain to interest both @entity327 and @entity328 , one of the senior kidnappers is said to have spoken @entity332 with a ‘ perfect accent ’ raising the possibility of at least one of the terrorists being linked to the @entity155 .			2

*eyewitness* : ' the army bombed four out of five of the trucks and four of them were destroyed '
@entity6 's @entity5 claim they were forced to act after the gunmen had demanded to be allowed to take their captives *abroad*
the compound completely *isolated* in desert , there was nowhere to hide
attack was a surprise as the compound is usually ' heavily guarded '
