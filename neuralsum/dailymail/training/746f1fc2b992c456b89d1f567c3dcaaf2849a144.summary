created : 12:14 gmt , 10 june 2014 when @entity1 was unable to use her normal parking space , she left her car on a slip road at a supermarket yards from the beauty salon where she works			1
but she returned to find to her horror that staff at the @entity10 store had smashed a window to get in , then pushed the @entity12 into a bush , scratching the body			1
they claimed the ten - year - old vehicle had been obstructing a delivery lorry trying to use the private access road			1
dumped : @entity1 finished work to discover her red £ 4,000 @entity12 pushed off the road with the driver ’s window in pieces and glass over the seat in a bush : the beauty therapist , who works just a hundred yards away , had moved from her regular parking spot which was closed due to maintenance work angry : miss @entity1 said there were no double yellow lines or signs telling her she could n't park in the road yesterday beauty therapist @entity34 , 29 , accused @entity10 of vandalising her car , which was towed to a garage for repairs			1
she has reported staff to police			2
‘ it ’s unbelievable – i ’ve basically had my car vandalised by a big supermarket chain , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ i ’ve been told it will take two weeks to repair it , which means i ’m paying £ 8 a day in taxi fares – on top of my £ 95 insurance excess			2
‘ if someone blocked my drive and i damaged their car trying to move it , i ’d have the police round			0
why should @entity10 be any different ? the store ’s attitude was disgusting – they did n’t even put a note on my window , they just left the car in a bush			1
there are no double yellow lines or signs			0
there were cars parked behind me and i do n’t see how my car was causing an obstruction			0
‘ the salon ’s only a moment away – why did no one come in to see if it belonged to an employee or a customer before smashing their way in ? ’ yesterday three plastic barriers had been put up in an effort to stop people parking on the access road in @entity80 , @entity81			1
@entity1 finished work to discover her red £ 4,000 @entity12 pushed off the road and in a bush when miss @entity85 returned to her car she found it in bushes with the windows smashed in @entity10 said : ‘ we have apologised to @entity91 and are covering all costs of the damage to her vehicle and all the associated expenses			1
‘ as a very last resort we had to move a vehicle that was preventing an @entity10 delivery truck from reversing into the loading bay			1
' our store staff had searched for the owner for more than four hours			2
they also contacted the local police to try and obtain the registered owner ’s details			0
' unfortunately these were not available			0
' after every other option was taken into consideration , the car was then moved by @entity10 staff			1
' the owner of the car returned at approximately 9pm , three hours after we moved it			0
staff at the @entity10 say they were forced to break into the car so a delivery driver could access the store picture shows where @entity1 's car was parked before members of staff broke in and pushed it out of the way the @entity10 in @entity125 , @entity81 , where staff broke in to a customer 's car to move it out of the way ' we are in communication with the car owner to rectify the damage caused , have offered to pay for all repairs and have apologised for any inconvenience			1
' @entity135 said : ' it ’s not an @entity135 highway			0
it ’s a private road			2
' while police can tow away a vehicle causing an obstruction on a public road , rules of trespass apply to a car parked on private land , legal experts say			2
the landowner could claim for trespass but any award would be likely to be as low as £ 20			0
and anyone damaging a car while trying to move it could be sued in the small claims court and face prosecution for criminal damage			0
@entity157 , from the @entity158 , said : ‘ motorists who cause an obstruction are a source of great frustration , but taking direct action in the knowledge it will cause damage to the car is completely unacceptable			0
’ police are investigating last friday ’s incident as possible criminal damage			0
