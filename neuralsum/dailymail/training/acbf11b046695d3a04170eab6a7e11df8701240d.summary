@entity0 refused to make any excuses after his record - equalling winning streak over @entity3 came to a comprehensive end in the quarter - finals of the @entity6 on tuesday			1
@entity3 won three of his first four meetings with @entity0 but had not tasted victory over the @entity10 since 2006 , his 17 straight defeats equalling a record in the open era			1
however , the 29 - year - old @entity14 picked the ideal time to end the sequence with a stunning 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 ( 7/5 ) victory on @entity18 and has yet to drop a set in the championship			1
the nine - time @entity37 champion also lost a set 6 - 0 to @entity40 's @entity39 in an exhibition event in @entity42 earlier this month and had constantly maintained he was not a top contender in @entity44 due to the wrist injury and appendicitis which ruined the latter half of 2014			1
' i am feeling okay			2
just was not my day , ' said @entity0 , whose sole @entity6 title to date came back in 2009			1
' i did n't play with the right intensity , with the right rhythm , and the opponent played better than me			2
' it is a day that i just can congratulate my opponent			2
it is obvious that i needed something more to be more competitive , as i did in the third set			2
' the third was the right set , the right game that i have to play			0
' but is obvious that before i did n't play with the right confidence , with the right intensity , losing court ( position ) , playing very short			0
i make him play very easy			0
' so you can not expect to win matches in quarter - finals of a grand slam helping the opponent to play well			1
the 28 - year - old did threaten a comeback during the third set - but @entity3 held on despite taking the third set to a tiebreak , @entity0 was unable to force his way back into the match ' since the beginning of the third , i played with more character , more the way that i have to play to have chances to be where i want to be , to be where i have been for the last lot of years			1
' as i said when i arrived here , the process always is not easy			0
when you have injuries , the comebacks are difficult			0
' there are so many examples around the world of sport that have been tough to be back			0
i 'm not an exception on that , no ? ' i have to take the positive things			0
without being at my top level of tennis i was able to be here in quarter - finals			2
' is not a bad result at all for me arriving here the way i arrived , only with five matches in seven months			0
' @entity3 broke @entity0 twice in the first set and three times in the second , barely being troubled on his serve until having to save two break points in the ninth game of the third set			1
@entity0 then saved two match points to force a tiebreak and another at 6 - 4 in the breaker , but netted a return on the fourth match point after @entity3 had set it up with a superb forehand return winner			1
@entity3 was in complete control for the vast majority of the match as he reached the last four ' i was definitely ready for it , i set up my plan pretty well and stuck with that all the way through the three sets , ' a delighted @entity3 said			1
' i was expecting a very tough battle but i was ready for everything and i think that was the biggest difference			0
' i started pretty well but you are playing @entity0 and you have to really keep going until the last point			1
you have to be ready for everything			0
' he is a great fighter but i stayed focused and kept doing my stuff and it was working pretty good			0
' @entity3 praised the influence of new coach @entity130 , who previously helped @entity39 win grand slam titles at the @entity132 and @entity31			1
' i 've been really happy with how we work together so far but the good thing is i am already able to execute the things on the court , ' @entity3 added			1
we set up a great plan for today and it worked , so what could be better ? ' asked what @entity140 had come up with , @entity3 replied : ' i think i 'm going to keep it a bit secret			2
' that would be really pointless setting up the tactics and the way how we want to prepare for the matches if i just open up everything here			0
' but he changed a lot of things			0
he changed a lot of positive things			0
