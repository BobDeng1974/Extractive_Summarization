they 're the street girls from @entity1 who are taking up skateboarding to save their lives			1
hundreds of young girls in the war - torn country have signed up with charity @entity7 to get off the streets and back into school			1
the chaos and destruction of 30 years of war in @entity1 have created a country where children have few role models - and instead see dangerous fanatical figures and murderous war lords as the leaders of society			1
but the charity are now working to create a new generation of leaders in the country , and recently opened their first outdoor skatepark in the northern city of @entity26			1
founder @entity32 said : ' we want the girls to see one another as role models instead of the war lords who would drive around town with a car load of men who are waving guns around ' inspiration : @entity7 ' use skateboarding as a tool for empowering youth , to create new opportunities and the potential for change '			1
they are giving new hope to a new generation of children in @entity1 opportunity : the charity want to inspire the children on to greater things			2
' @entity7 is about creating opportunities for the kids so that they can see that it is possible for them to have a chance to do what they want for their lives ' , said @entity32 skateboard star : @entity68 , 16 , is one of @entity1 's best skaters			1
she said : ' when i came to @entity7 , my life changed so much , because when i was working on the street , people would harass me ' @entity74 , 16 , was selling tea on the streets and in the parks of ravaged @entity78 when she first visited one the charity 's skateparks in 2010			1
now she is one @entity1 ’s most talented skaters and has become an inspiring teacher and role model for other young girls and has even joined @entity7 ’s staff in the city as an instructor			2
the teenager said : ' when i came to @entity7 , my life changed so much , because when i was working on the street , people would harass me			2
' now i feel good because i 'm at @entity7 and i 'm teaching the students			2
when the students call me teacher , it makes me very happy			0
i think by becoming a good skater , i 'll create a better future for myself			0
' @entity74 has enrolled in the charity 's @entity98 programme , and is hoping to return to public school with her friends			2
challenging : the charity 's new outdoor facility in @entity26 features an outdoor classroom and skatepark obstacles for students to tackle the charity was set up by @entity108 , who believes that the 800 children he is working with across the country are determined to build a better future for themselves , @entity32 , from @entity112 in @entity113 , said : ‘ we want the girls to see one another as role models instead of the war lords who would drive around town with a car load of men who are waving guns around			1
‘ it ’s important that they have role models , and we want their role models to be other @entity1 kids who are healthy and happy			1
the girls can see that they now have opportunities and options in their lives that may have not been there before			0
‘ @entity7 is about creating opportunities for the kids so that they can see that it is possible for them to have a chance to do what they want for their lives			2
’ children in @entity1 have lived amongst conflict for more than 30 years and the country was named by charity @entity140 as the worst place in the world to be born			1
but @entity7 staff are contributing to a new sense of hope in the country , and @entity32 said : ‘ we want to help create a new generation of leaders in @entity1 that can tackle the problems that they face in society			1
‘ people might come to @entity1 and say ‘ your political system is corrupt ’ or ‘ your education system is not good enough ’ , but rather than tell them how to fix it , we want the kids to understand that what they consider to be important issues are the things that they can help change			0
‘ there are issues with drugs , such as opium and heroin abuse			0
other things such as self - immolation , forced marriages and policemen taking bribes can be a problem			0
‘ we want to create a situation where they can stand up and tackle these problems in society as young @entity1 people who want to make their country a better place			2
’ the charity started in 2007 with just three skateboards and a motorbike to transport them around ravaged @entity78 but investment meant they were soon able to open their own skate park for budding boarders			0
the new outdoor facility in @entity26 has been designed to feature pathways with skatepark obstacles , an outdoor classroom , trees for shade , grass areas for outdoor sports , gardens and a greenhouse			2
founder : @entity32 first visited @entity1 in 2006 and established @entity7 the following year			0
he said : ' we want to help create a new generation of leaders in @entity1 that can tackle the problems that they face in society ' @entity32 , 40 , said : ' this is the first outdoor skate facility in the country , so it represents a big step forward for us			1
it was really exciting for us to be able to work on the design which has been made to look like a traditional @entity1 garden			0
' this is a unique space in @entity1 , where opportunities to safely skateboard outside are rare – especially for female students			0
we have about 550 students in @entity26 and just under half of those – around 47 per cent – are girls			0
‘ we have the capability to host a lot more than that , so we are currently in the process of building up our number of teachers and hopefully getting more buses to help transport the students to the facility			0
’ the challenges faced by @entity32 and his team remain difficult , and in 2012 they were heartbroken when one of their teachers and three students were brutally murdered during a suicide attack on international military base in @entity78			0
recent estimates claim that there have been more than 21,000 civilian casualties in @entity1 due to war in the last 11 years alone			1
@entity32 and his dedicated team work daily to get kids off the streets and back into the education system through their learning programmes and projects			0
‘ we have three different groups that they join , depending on their age and circumstances : skate and create , @entity98 and @entity251 ’ , he said			0
wheel - y great : the outdoor space in @entity26 has been designed to feature pathways with skatepark obstacles , an outdoor classroom , trees for shade , grass areas for outdoor sports , gardens and a greenhouse			2
no obstacle : the young girls love tackling the ramps on the skatepark , and are also learning how to overcome @entity1 's wider society problems in the classroom as well new hope : skateboarding is giving a new lease of life to the street kids in the country , which has a population of approximately 31 million people ‘ @entity276 is a session where they are encouraged to use their creative ability alongside practising their skateboarding			1
‘ @entity281 is a very important one as that is where we take the street kids who have dropped out of the education system and put them on an accelerated course to get back into school			1
‘ and youth leadership is for the slightly older students where we give them opportunities to become more responsible leaders amongst their peer groups , as well as get involved in creative elements such as photography and blogging and so on			0
‘ the courses are designed very much as a springboard so that the students can use take the opportunity to improve themselves and enjoy skateboarding sessions as well			0
’ for more information on @entity7 , visit : @entity305 / bright future : @entity7 offers hope to the young girls in the war - torn country , where there are estimated to have been more than 21,000 civilian casualties in @entity1 due to war in the last 11 years alone colourful : skateistan are open six days per week and offers single gender classes to keep boys and girls separate while they skate all smiles : women ca n't ride bicycles in @entity1 , but skateboarding is novel enough to be open to women and has attracted them in droves to the school and skateparks where classes are free success : one of the world 's poorest and most conservative countries seems a strange place to set up a skateboarding school , but the founders say it has proved a remarkably successful way to reach out to marginalized children , particularly girls			1
