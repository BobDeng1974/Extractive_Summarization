@entity2 women who have travelled to @entity3 to offer themselves to @entity5 fighters are returning home pregnant with rebels ' children , it has been revealed			1
a @entity2 government minister told members of parliament this week the women , who are waging ' sexual jihad ' , are ' having sexual relations with 20,30,100 ' men before returning to @entity2 pregnant			1
interior minister @entity15 made the revelations at the @entity17 on thursday , though did n't elaborate on the number of women who have returned in this condition			2
@entity2 women who travelled to @entity3 to offer themselves to @entity5 opposition fighters in sexual jihad are returning pregnant , a government minister has claimed ' after the sexual liaisons they have there in the name of ' jihad al - nikah ' -- ( sexual holy war , in @entity29 ) -- they come home pregnant , ' he said			1
jihad al - nikah , permitting extramarital sexual relations with multiple partners , is considered by some hardline @entity32 as a legitimate form of holy war			1
the minister also did not say how many @entity2 women were thought to have gone to @entity3 for such a purpose , although media reports have said hundreds have done so , @entity39 24 revealed			1
however , @entity40 also said that since he assumed office in march , ' six thousand of our young people have been prevented from going ' to the country			2
he has said in the past that border controls have been boosted to intercept young @entity2 seeking to travel to @entity3			1
earlier this year a group of @entity2 girls travelled to rebel - held @entity3 to offer themselves to opposition fighters			1
their action came after growing in concern in @entity2 about religious orders or ' fatwas ' that circulated the internet calling on @entity56 women to perform jihad through sex			1
a @entity2 minister of religious affairs appealed to girls at the time not to be influenced by @entity62 preachers outside of @entity2 who made a number of ' sexual fatwas '			1
@entity65 rejected ' sexual jihad ' fatwas , urging @entity2 people and state institutions to not respond to them			1
free @entity71 fighters man an anti-aircraft gun on a truck in the village of @entity75 , in the southern countryside of @entity77 @entity2 newspapers reported that a young @entity2 man divorced his wife , and that they both headed to @entity3 almost a month ago to ' allow her to engage in sexual jihad with the mujahideen ' there			1
this report followed earlier ones of a video widely circulated on the internet and social websites in @entity2 shows the parents of a veiled girl called @entity90 , 17			0
they said @entity92 disappeared from home one morning and they ' later learned that she had headed to @entity3 to carry out sexual jihad			1
' the young girl has since returned to her family , who have kept her out of sight , and said that their daughter is not a religious fanatic ' but was influenced by her fellow students who are known for their affiliation with the jihadist @entity104			0
' free @entity71 fighters fire their weapons during clashes with what activists say are government forces , in the village of @entity75 , in the southern countryside of @entity77 her parents said these fellow students may have brainwashed her and convinced her to travel to @entity3 ' to support the mujahideen there			0
' news websites and social networks in @entity2 circulated a fatwa attributed to @entity119 in which he called upon ' @entity56 women ' to perform jihad through sex			2
however , sources close to the sheikh denied that he had issued the fatwa , stressing that anyone who circulates or believes it is insane			0
@entity129 was widely considered to be financially backing the @entity3 rebels fighting in @entity3 and whose hardcore ‘ @entity104 ’ strand of @entity62 influences a great number of the young fighters – many of whom are ‘ jihadists ’ and come from @entity136 , including the @entity137			0
reports in @entity2 stressed though that the fatwa had gained much attention on @entity143 regime websites , the goal of which may be to tarnish the image of the @entity62 fighters by stressing a key point of @entity3 leader @entity147 that fundamentalists , supported by @entity104 groups in @entity129 , are amongst the @entity3 rebels			2
@entity151 , a researcher on the affairs of @entity62 groups , told @entity154 : ' the issue of sexual jihad was initially attributed to a @entity129 sheikh who denied it , and this fatwa is abnormal and not endorsed by religious scholars			2
' he added that this fatwa — had it indeed been issued — may involve @entity3 girls living in @entity3 , who can ' support the mujahideen by marrying them for a few hours			0
' under @entity62 law , a man can marry and consummate a marriage with his bride , before divorcing her the next day without any resistance from the bride or her family simply by following religious etiquette			0
@entity171 , said that @entity2 should not abide by the fatwa			0
her calls were duplicated by the @entity2 opposition also			0
@entity175 , a @entity2 opposition figure , said that the ' jihad marriages ' were a disgrace for the @entity2			0
she also called on the authorities to start dealing with the increasing phenomenon of @entity2 jihadis heading to @entity3 to join radical @entity5 groups			2
@entity182 told the @entity184 press agency that the phenomenon was a dangerous one			0
she said that young girls , including minors , have been sent to @entity3 to ' marry ' jihadis for a few hours .			0
