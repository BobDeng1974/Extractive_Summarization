businesses have also been asked to deploy private security and block off entrances to building in an attempt to crack down on the possibility of violent demonstrations			1
another unorthodox protest expected to take place tomorrow is throwing milk on the road in an ironic gesture aimed at the woman once known as the ' milk snatcher '			1
the funeral procession will go from the @entity45 to @entity18 ahead of the funeral ceremony which starts at 11am			0
it will be globally televised to an audience of millions , and is expected to attract widespread protests from left - wingers opposing the legacy of the divisive leader			0
' we have been approached by a small number of people planning to protest , ' commander @entity53 said today			1
' we are working with them , and would ask anyone who plans to protest to come forward and speak with us today			1
' there are also fears it could be targeted by terrorists , particularly in the wake of the bomb blasts which killed three people at yesterday 's @entity65 , although a @entity67 spokesman said today that the force had not altered its security plans			1
duty : an officer and his dog guard security banners today as they look out for potential threats search : a policeman lends his sniffer dog a helping hand during a security sweep at @entity24 @entity80 have told businesses along the route to remove ' dustbins , ladders or loose tools and equipment , which could be used to gain access or used as weapons '			1

security : barriers have been set up outside @entity18 's to control the crowds at @entity2 's funeral gates : the extraordinary measures are aimed to prevent against violent protests or attacks patrol : two armed officers on their rounds in @entity133 , awaiting the arrival of @entity2 's coffin one of the more unusual protests which has been discussed on @entity137 could involve flooding the @entity36 streets with milk , or demonstrators throwing milk at the funeral procession			1
@entity2 became notorious as ' @entity2 , milk snatcher ' when she abolished free milk for most schoolchildren while she was @entity146 under @entity147			2
one @entity137 user wrote : ' i think the best protest against the @entity2 funeral would be to go the day before and pour milk on to the route			1
' police were under pressure last night to crack down on plans by protesters to turn their backs on the coffin in a gesture of disrespect			1
campaigners said @entity163 has effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law and will not provoke arrests			0
the move is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police			2
it will be seen by millions of people worldwide as the huge ceremonial occasion is beamed live around the world on tv			0
ceremony : soldiers rehearsing the funeral of @entity2 yesterday , carrying a coffin outside @entity18 's police chiefs said they are ‘ not there to uphold respect ’ and said demonstrators who are merely ‘ insulting ’ are unlikely to face arrest			1

the environmental campaigner said : ‘ it is symbolic gesture that i turn my back on @entity210 and all it stood for and i hope other people will join me			2
’ @entity212 , @entity213 , the architect behind the back - turning protest , said the public nature of the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures			2
he said : ‘ simply saying it is beastly , horrible or distasteful - a point of view that i can understand - does not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate			0
‘ therefore what i am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose who want to demonstrate			0
i ’m not saying they should or they should n’t , but for those that choose to there should be a legal way			0
‘ it might well be cathartic or therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way , and the police have agreed it is legal , is to turn your backs on the cortege			1
’ @entity163 refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral			0
but several @entity243 protest groups that sprung up since @entity2 died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following			2
one group , @entity246 ’s @entity245 , threatens to hold a ‘ right jolly knees - up ’ outside @entity18			0
@entity248 defended the right to protest during the funeral , arguing that police were obliged to protect peaceful demonstrations			1
' some may feel it is distasteful to protest at a funeral but the right to protest is fundamental to a democracy , ' chief executive @entity253 said			2
' the role of the police is to maintain order not to prevent legitimate protest by those who wish to show dissent			1
' anger : anarchists , students and militant far left groups have held parties to celebrate the death of @entity2 retired chief constable dr @entity270 said police are forced to tread the fine line between the right to protest and upholding the law			1
the retired @entity276 chief said shouting insults may even be tolerated as behaviour that is ‘ insulting but not alarming or distressing ’ may be allowed			0
he said police will have the ‘ human rights ’ of protesters to ‘ freedom of expression ’ at the front of their minds			1
asked if shouting would be an offence , he replied : ‘ it depends what is being shouted			0
that is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy			0
’ speaking on @entity291 , he said police will be ‘ very firm ’ if protest becomes disruption , for example if objects are thrown at the procession			1
dr @entity270 said : ‘ my expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed			2
’ @entity305 , the former @entity306 chairman , described protesters as ‘ mindless bigots ’ but said police have no option if they obey the law			1
he said their actions will not provoke her supporters , adding : ‘ hopefully , those of us who admire @entity2 are too well - mannered to fall for the bait			0
’ @entity2 ’s former press secretary sir @entity318 accused police of ‘ conniving at a display of bad taste			2
’ he said : ‘ the plain fact is that we know exactly what these @entity325 and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it			0
