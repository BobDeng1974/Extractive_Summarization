by @entity0 in the very near future there will be machines that act just like humans , doctors will be able to eradicate cancers using your dna and the password will finally die a death			0
that ’s according to predictions from tech experts at @entity14			0
the firm ’s annual 5 in 5 report , which looks ahead at technology trends has , this year , focused on the development of smarter computers , phones and other machines			0
it predicts that ‘ everything will learn ’ from the data we store online , what websites we visit , where we go and how we act - and this information will be used for good , and not just for advertising purposes			1
for example , rather than having passwords , applications will be able to talk to each other to give and learn who a person is			0
it can then immediately identify unusual or suspicious behaviour and prevent identity theft according to the annual @entity14 5 in 5 report , in the next five years : the classroom will learn you - smarter classrooms will use cloud data to learn about students and identify learning disorders immediately buying local will beat online - shops will combine the convenience of online shopping in physical stores and same - day delivery will improve			1
doctors will routinely use your dna to keep you well - by using advancements in dna research , doctors will be able to uniquely identify how a certain cancer or disease will affect a person			1
treatments and medications will become more tailored and waiting times will drop			0
a digital guardian will protect you online - passwords will be replaced by devices that learn who a person is , how they behave and what sites they use			1
they will grant access automatically to that person , but also be able to identify unusual or suspicious activity automatically			0
the city will help you live in it - governments will be able to use data about its residents movements , needs and more to improve cities and towns , including schools and transport routes			1
the report then breaks down the predictions into five categories and predicts that each of them will happen by 2018			0
for example , in five years , @entity14 predicts ‘ security is going to become more agile ’			1
rather than having passwords for different devices , sites and sevices , all of these applications will be able to talk to each other to give a ‘ 360 - degree view of a person ’s data and movements			1
’ this means these devices will just know who someone is , without that person ever having to identify themselves			0
this so - called ‘ digital guardian ’ will be trained to focus on a person and learn how they behave to then be able to identify any unusual or suspicious activity ; making identity theft a thing of the past			2
elsewhere , @entity14 claims the classroom of the future will be able learn about each student over the course of their education to help them master the skills they need to meet individual goals			2
it will be powered by a system of sophisticated computers that study data about students stored in the cloud and will be able to immediately identify learning disorders , such as dyslexia , discover if any students are at risk from failing , or even bullying , and will suggest measures to help these students solve these problems			1
one of the more surprising @entity14 5 in 5 predictions is that the high - street will bounce back and beat online shopping			1
according to the report , ‘ buying local will become du jour once again			1
' one of the more surprising @entity14 predictions is that the high - street will bounce back and beat online shopping			1
retailers will be able to combine digital products and services with physical stores meaning shoppers can physically , or virtually touch and try on clothes before ordering them to arrive in minutes retailers will be able to combine digital products and services with physical stores meaning shoppers can physically , or virtually touch and try on clothes before ordering them to arrive in minutes			0
services including @entity158 are already making one - hour delivery a possibility , and @entity14 expects this to become even more popular			2
in medical terms , advancements in dna research will help doctors understand how a tumour , for example , will uniquely affect each patient			0
smart analysis will then be able to offer medications or treatments that can best attack that particular type of cancer in that particular individual , while reducing the time it takes to find the right treatment for a patient ‘ from weeks and months to days and minutes ’			0

smart analysis will then be able to offer medications or treatments that can best attack that particular type of cancer in that particular individual the final prediction made by @entity14 is about smarter cities			2
the firm believes that in five years governments and councils will be able to understand , in real - time , how billions of events occur within a city or town			1
computers will learn to understand what people need , what they like , what they do , and how they move from place to place and use this information to help develop transport routes , for example , or improve schools			2
' we know more now than any other generation at any time has known			0
elsewhere , @entity14 claims the classroom of the future will be able learn about each student over the course of their education to help them master the skills they need to meet individual goals			2
it will be powered by a system of sophisticated computers will also be able to immediately identify learning disorders , such as dyslexia ' and yet , we struggle to keep up with this flood of increasingly complex information , let alone make sense of the meaning that is inherent in the massive amounts of data we are acquiring at ever faster rates , ' said dr. @entity230 , director , @entity231 , @entity14			1
' by creating technology that is explicitly designed to learn and enhance our cognition we will usher in a new era of progress for both individuals and for society at large			0
' @entity14 believes that these changes will be fuelled by ' a new era in computing ’ that will lead to ' breakthroughs that will amplify human abilities , assist us in making good choices , look out for us and help us navigate our world in powerful new ways			0

in five years , @entity14 predicts cancer will be individually treated at a dna level
buying local will overtake online shopping as same - day delivery improves
' @entity270 ' classrooms will identify dyslexia and other disorders immediately
passwords will be replaced with devices that learn to identify people
governments will also be able to use data in real - time to help develop cities
