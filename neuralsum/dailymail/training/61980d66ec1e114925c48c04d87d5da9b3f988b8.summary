there are only 15 minutes of daylight left when we arrive at our lodge deep in the heart of @entity6 's @entity5			1
' are you ready for a little walk ? ' asks our handsome young guide , @entity10			1
a few squirts of insect repellent later , and we 're heading down a reddish dirt track - and suddenly it 's like a fly - past and a fashion show and a circus performance all at once			1
but there is nothing contrived about any of it			2
wet and wonderful : the @entity5 region is a version of @entity6 far removed from the beaches of @entity25 @entity10 points out two hyacinth macaws canoodling in a palm tree , their astonishing blue feathers occasionally wafting in the softest of breezes			1
two burrowing owls stand to attention on the ground near their nest			2
a great brown hawk glides above us , and a dozen or so chirping parakeets whizz over our heads			2
a motley crew of wild pigs scamper about , and near the lake we can see several capybara , the world 's biggest rodent , emerging from the lagoon			1
click , click , job done			2
but this is only the amuse - bouche of a feast of birds , animals , fauna and flora , sunsets , lakes and much - needed education that awaits us in this unique marshy wetland , the world 's biggest floodplain ( greater than the size of @entity61 ) , where you 'll find the largest macaws , the tallest storks , the biggest collection of caimans and gagarin and some species of birds and creepy crawlies that look like they 've been dreamed up by boffins on psychedelic drugs			1
now you see me , now you do n't : the jaguar is one of the @entity5 's most exciting and elusive residents the @entity5 is pretty much in the centre of @entity81			1
we are staying on a farm belonging to @entity84 , a paper baron from @entity86			2
it is about a four - hour drive from @entity89			2
you take a straight road out of town , and after some three hours you are on a track			2
for the last hour , we see only one other vehicle before arriving in the @entity95			2
there are 53,000 hectares and 35,000 @entity98 cattle on @entity84 's land			0
and , by the sounds of it , this is a labour of love			0
a place of mists and fruitfulness : the @entity5 is at its most beautiful when the morning fog rises climate change sceptics might scoff , but i can sense the anxiety in @entity10 's demeanour when he tells us how the four defining seasons in the @entity5 are nothing like as defined as they once were			1
we are here in march , but the rains have not yet arrived and this could be catastrophic if it becomes a trend			0
in a single day , the @entity5 can get 178 billion litres of rain water - which is equal to the volume of all bottled water sold every day worldwide			1
two big projects are ongoing in this remarkable wilderness			1
waiting for the rains to fall : miniature lagoons appear in the surface of the @entity5 during the dry season one is all about saving the macaws - and the results are spectacular			1
twenty years ago there were only 1,500 of these wonderful birds in the whole of the @entity5 , today there are 6,000			1
but there 's not much margin for error			0
the macaws nest in only one kind of tree and eat only one kind of nut			0
as chicks they have many predators , and they produce only one chick per year			0
they are partners for life , often together for more than 35 years			0
the other main project is to do with the jaguar			1
@entity10 and his colleagues speak about these beautiful animals with such reverence that we long to see one but , alas , we are unlucky - the best time to see them is during the dry season from june to october , during the @entity6 winter			1
saddle up : cattle rearing is an important and visible profession in this most spectacular of regions our room is simple , with a small balcony where a hammock has pride of place looking out across the lagoon			0
one evening , as dusk falls , we go on a canoe safari , after being seen off by a giant motionless caiman with his jaws locked open			0
i am convinced he 's made of plastic and is put there whenever there are visitors			0
but then i get within a couple of yards and he swishes his tail , raises his head and disappears into the water			0
after 24 hours alone in the lodge we get a rare sighting : two elderly @entity189			0
we find it hard not to ask what on earth they are doing here but they turn out to be enthusiastic , valuable additions to our team			0
up before the beak : fabulous feathered creatures - including the toucan - are on show in the @entity5 they come with us on a night drive when we see giant anteaters ( they are almost deaf and blind — the anteaters that is , not the @entity189 ) , hoovering up food as if they have n't eaten for days , when we know that pretty much all they do is eat			1
' this is the most peaceful place i have ever been , ' says my wife one morning			0
this is communing with nature like nowhere else on @entity214			0
