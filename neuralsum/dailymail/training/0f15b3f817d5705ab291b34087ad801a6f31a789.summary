a timelapse showing the first design changes to an @entity3 aircraft since 1998 has been released to celebrate the company 's 20th year of flying			1
there are two main design changes			0
@entity3 's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the @entity3 logo which is 15 per cent bigger than before			1
secondly , an orange stripe reflecting the design language of @entity3 's advertising has been introduced on to the fuselage			1
it 's the first @entity3 re-design since 1998 as the company moves into its 20th year of flying this enables the @entity3 logo to be reversed out of that colour - in accordance with brand guidelines - and to give the plane a sleek , more modern look			1
‎ finally , the '			0
com ' has been dropped			0
@entity22 , @entity3 's commercial director , said : ' @entity3 's aircraft livery is one of the most recognised in aviation			1
' as we approach our 20th birthday in november , we felt a refreshed livery would complement the many changes already made to @entity3 including allocated seating , transparent prices , flexible tickets and our award winning mobile app. ' the airline currently has a fleet of @entity37 – a mixture of @entity39 and @entity40			2
the new livery will feature on all new @entity3 aircraft deliveries from april 2015			1
@entity3 has 197 @entity46 aircraft on order , the majority of which will replace older @entity46 aircraft currently in the fleet			2
a timelapse video shows the work it takes to give the @entity3 aircraft a fresh , new look the long logo is sprayed off the main shell as the company aims for a sleek new look to the plane in addition , younger planes in @entity3 's fleet will have the new livery applied when they ‎ are scheduled to be repainted , typically every six years			1
taken together this means 29 aircraft will be flying with the new look by the end of 2015 and 50 per cent of the fleet will sport the new livery by the end of 2017			1
a specialist team is needed to repaint an aircraft which takes around seven days on average			0
during @entity3 's 19 year history there have been only two aircraft styles			2
the first , seen in 1995 on @entity3 's first aircraft , was different to anything else flying as it advertised the booking number along the fuselage in giant lettering			2
imagine if all planes looked like this ? thankfully this is only half - way through the design process the final design was selected by a poll of 4,000 members of @entity3 staff the second , which entered service in 1998 , displayed @entity3 across the fuselage which reflected the important move the airline made to online booking			0
@entity94 at @entity96 design agency who worked with @entity3 's in house engineering team on the new livery said : ' we have spent a lot of time getting to know the personality and attitude of the @entity3 brand and this new livery design was a direct translation of that			0
' @entity3 's recent brand update reflected their growth from low cost airline to one of @entity114 's largest carriers and with this came a new attitude and a new confidence - one that was n't reflected in their current livery			0
@entity3 's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the company logo out with the old and in with the new ! this design will slowly disappear from the @entity3 fleet ' this new livery is a carefully considered design evolution that is both confident and fresh and we feel it reflects @entity3 's ethos of modern simplicity			1
' @entity131 , head of aviation at @entity133 , who provide the coatings for the aircraft added : ' @entity133 is very proud to be the chosen coatings supplier to @entity3			0
' we take great pride in the manufacture and supply of the most high quality and innovative @entity142			0
@entity3 and @entity133 have the same philosophy to combine quality with efficiency and we are delighted to support the high quality image of @entity3			0
