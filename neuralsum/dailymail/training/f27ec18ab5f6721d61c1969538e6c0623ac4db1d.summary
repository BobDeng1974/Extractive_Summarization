by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 21 march 2013 counter-terror teams are foiling a plot as big as the july 7 attacks every year , a senior police officer has revealed			0
deputy assistant commissioner @entity5 also said the threats against the @entity7 are constantly changing and @entity9 extremists are now planning in smaller groups in a bid to avoid detection			1
he said : ' on average we 've probably had about one potential attack planned with an intent to create something similar to july 7 every year			0

deputy assistant commissioner @entity5 has said counter-terror teams regularly foil plots ' the @entity7 threat as we stand today remains at substantial , which means that a terrorist attack remains a strong possibility and could occur without warning			1
' this came as new figures revealed the number of terror arrests had risen by 60 per cent in the year to september 2012			1
a total of 245 people were held on suspicion of terrorism - related offences in the period , compared with 153 in the previous 12 months , the @entity33 said			1
mr @entity5 , who is senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism , said extremists are returning from abroad wanting to mastermind plots in small groups			2
this follows the foiling of large scale plans such as the plot to blow up passenger jets with bombs disguised as soft drinks in 2006 , and more recently a plan led by three men from @entity51 to set off up to eight ruck sack bombs in crowded areas			0
mr @entity5 said : ' some who have been trained actually are becoming quite self - motivated , they are beginning to plan in small groups which are hard to detect , ' he said			2
the 7/7 @entity57 bombings included an attack on a number 30 double - decker bus in @entity60 , which was destroyed emergency services at @entity63 station following the series of explosions which ripped through @entity57 's underground network on july 7 , 2005 suspected bombs at @entity68 on july 21 , 2005 , exactly two weeks after the 7/7 bombings ' there is no doubt that the big sophisticated 9/11 or 7/7 type plots are much harder to organise , they did need a lot of overseas direction , and some of the @entity76 leadership have said that 's good if you can do it , but if not any attack whatever you can do at whatever size is useful			2
' we are seeing more small groups getting together at shorter notice and more people wanting to do things without that broader command and control			0
' @entity76 remains the greatest terror threat to @entity7 , he said , and the most recent trend is for would - be jihadists to travel to @entity94 for training and to get involved in fighting			1
domestically , there is also a concern that terrorists will learn ' criminal tradecraft ' , again making their activities harder to detect .			0
