by @entity0 @entity1 has publicly rebuked her @entity3 colleague @entity2 for claiming that last week ’s figures about a steep increase in immigration were ‘ good news ’			1
the home secretary vented her anger at the @entity10 and called on the prime minister to limit the movement of foreign labour			1
@entity14 mr @entity2 was responding to figures showing that net migration to the @entity17 jumped by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to september 2013 , powered by a 40 per cent rise in the number of people taking advantage of @entity23 laws on free movement			1
slapped down : @entity1 , the home secretary , left , has publicly rebuked her @entity3 colleague @entity2 , right , for his claim that last week 's figures showing a steep increase in immigration were ' good news ' mrs may , writing in today ’s @entity31 , expresses her alarm at the figures , which come despite @entity36 ’s promise at the last election to slash net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by 2015			1
and she slapped down mr @entity2 for claiming it was a sign of @entity17 ’s booming economy			2
‘ @entity2 said this rise was “ good news ”			2
i do not agree , ’ writes mrs may , before going on to complain : ‘ at the moment we are bound by the treaties that successive governments have signed			0
these mean we can not impose formal immigration controls on @entity52 migrants			0
’ she argues that mr @entity36 ’s plans to claw back powers from @entity55 prior to a referendum on @entity52 membership in 2017 should be used as an opportunity to change @entity23 laws on migration			0
the home secretary wants new member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before their workers are allowed to travel to the @entity17 to find employment			2
some 24,000 citizens of @entity68 and @entity69 arrived in the year to september 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year			0
those numbers are likely to rise , as the statistics pre-date the lifting of border controls on @entity68 and @entity69 on january 1			0
mrs may stands near the border control gates at @entity76 : she wants new @entity52 member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before their workers are allowed to travel to the @entity17 to find work mr @entity2 , who is to the left of most of the @entity14 , and mrs may , who is on the right of the @entity82 , are both keen to establish their leadership credentials ahead of any potential contest after the 2015 vote			0
in his provocative remarks last week , mr @entity2 said : ‘ actually , those figures are good news because the reason net immigration is going up is because fewer @entity17 people are emigrating and surely that ’s a good thing – people are getting jobs here			1
’ mrs may ’s rebuke to @entity2 came as former @entity97 defence secretary @entity96 warned mr @entity36 that he must ditch the ‘ statistical nonsense ’ of his immigration policy and adopt a radical plan to reduce the number of immigrants in @entity17 if the prime minister wants to win back voters from @entity103			1
he added it would be ‘ dangerous complacency ’ if mr @entity36 were to ignore the electoral threat posed by @entity103 .			0
