by @entity1 reporter published : 09:01 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 5 june 2013 @entity2 has revealed the whopper ' hands - free ' holder that allower customers to wear their burger around their neck is a hoax			2
last week rumours emerged that 50 of the strange utensils were being given away in @entity11 in celebration of the chain 's 50th anniversary - they were showcased in an upbeat ad posted on @entity16			1
the contraption wraps around the neck and positions the famously flame - grilled delight just below the consumer 's mouth			1
' the video featuring a ‘ hands - free ’ @entity40 holder was produced by an agency in @entity11 to celebrate the brand and the iconic @entity40 in a humorous way			1
however , the product depicted in the spot was not produced , or distributed to guests as some reports indicate , ' reads the short statement from @entity2 to @entity50			2
but the company said that it is true that the first @entity2 in @entity11 opened in 1963 - so it is the chain ’s 50th anniversary in @entity11			1
to promote the @entity55 , the commercial , that has since been taken off the @entity2 site , played a multitude of scenarios in which people multitask while eating their burgers			2
at the beginning , a musician asks the audience in @entity64 : ' in a world of multitasking , how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a whopper at the same time ? ' food for fight : the burger chain has taken the ad off its site but it still remains on @entity16 where so far it has drawn 1,500 views smooth : the witty commercial begins by asking in @entity64 ' in a world of multitasking , how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a whopper at the same time ? ' practice makes perfect : the seemingly ironic ad has drawn criticism from people disgusted at the idea that people could be so lazy that they would n't even hold their food what follows is a witty selection of vignettes of characters performing tasks while eating the delicious fare			1
in one , a tattoo artist works on a client while feasting on his burger			0
in another , a sun - tanned young man massages a half naked woman on a beach while cheekily winking at the camera between bites			0
scenarios range from dancers to cops ticketing cars , cyclists and dog walkers , all of whom are able to multitask thanks to the ingenious @entity55			0
picture of health : the device hangs around the back of the neck positioning the burger in a cup below the chin ta - da ! most of the scenarios feature men as the burger - eating protagonists on duty : the repetitious lyrics outline all the things you can do with your hands if they 're free and then thank the @entity55 at the end for making it all possible notably only one of the scenes features a woman using the equipment while she paints her nails			0
produced by @entity2 , @entity138 are responsible for posting the ad on @entity16 and inviting users to comment			0
the response has been overwhelmingly negative			0
though some people ask the pressing question : what do you do when you 've eaten the first half ? watch video of @entity2 's @entity55 here !			1
