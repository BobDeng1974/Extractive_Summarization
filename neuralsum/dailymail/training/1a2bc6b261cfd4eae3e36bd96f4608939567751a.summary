plans for a 4,000 - seater stadium in the exclusive @entity3 resort in @entity4 has sparked uproar among its furious millionaire residents			1
the £ 12million arena , which would host beach sports like volleyball and football , would be on prime development land in what is one of the most expensive places to live in the @entity15 outside of @entity16			1
property developer and former @entity19 chairman , @entity18 , is behind the project , which will include shops , beach studios , restaurants , offices and a 450 - space car park			1
the area is reputed to be the fourth most expensive place in the world to buy real estate , behind @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity16 and some waterfront mansions have sold for up to £ 10million			1
its high - profile residents include @entity49 manager @entity48 , former @entity51 manager @entity50 , computer magnate sir @entity52 and @entity55 investor @entity53			1
earlier this year mr @entity18 revealed plans to turn the same area of council - owned land into an ultra-modern holiday destination like a ' mini-dubai '			1
those plans included a 33 - storey sports tower for abseiling and bungee jumping , a hotel shaped like a seagull , a marina and a helicopter landing pad			1
property developer and former @entity19 chairman , @entity18 , is behind the project but now he has back - peddled and said that his stadium plans were a more realistic goal			1
mr @entity18 , who has built more than 100 homes on @entity3 and the surrounding districts , said the stadium would be for general use year - round and an ice rink could be housed there in winter			1
' the stadium is modest in size and would fit exactly where the current pavilion sits at the moment , ' he said			0
' it was built in 1922 and is in a poor state of repair			0
it has no architectural value in my opinion and it 's about time something was done with it			2
' beach football is a growing sport and we have one of the best locations in the country , and even the world			2
beach volleyball is very popular too			2
' if we had a permanent base which facilitates these sports , events would probably be held more often , ' he said			0
' it 's a fantastic opportunity for the area			2
' ' ten acres of that site is currently tarmac , this is a well - thought out scheme and the revenue we would bring in would help towards the infrastructure needed in the area			2
' with the previous plans , i never said i was in a position to do that , i just wanted to gauge reactions to something happening here			0
' if we do n't keep up with the times @entity3 will fall behind			2
' this plan is realistic and can be built			0
i can build it and i would love to build it			0
it would be a wonderful project			0
' mr @entity18 said the stadium would take up under an acre of the ten - acre site and if the planning process goes smoothly he would hope to start building next autumn and open in spring 2016			2
however , @entity3 residents have expressed their fury over the plans and say the idea of a huge car park will be a blight on the landscape			1
the plans for the stadium also include shops , restaurants , offices and beach studios on the exclusive resort mr @entity18 said the stadium would be for use year - round and an ice rink could be housed there in winter @entity147 , chairman of @entity148 , a board of ten residents associations , said ' we do n't support multi-storey blocks that would be a real visual carbuncle			1
' beach sports are fine but they do n't require a large amount of building and actually mr @entity18 's plans would be illegal under the @entity157 , an act of parliament that limits development on @entity3			1
' local resident @entity159 said : ' i think it 's a very bad idea			0
the beaches should be for children to play on			0
' people have difficulty finding somewhere to park in the summer and the car park is jammed by 8am			1
@entity3 residents say the plans are a ' bad idea ' as the area is already overcrowded with tourists @entity147 , chairman of a local residents associations , says a car park with be a blight on the landscape ' we do n't need more tourism , the place is overcrowded as it is			1
' i would be very much against it			0
@entity184 council 's planning department confirmed an outline planning application had been submitted			0
@entity186 , planning and regeneration manager at the council , said : ' we can confirm that an outline planning application for a @entity191 has been received			0
' this proposal will now be checked for validation and subsequently considered by officers			0
' we are aware that the proposals relate to land owned by @entity184 and appropriate notices have been served by the applicants			0

the £ 12million arena would host beach sports like volleyball and football
it will be on prime development land in one of @entity15 's most expensive areas
property developer , @entity18 , says it will have shops and restaurants
plans also set out a 450 - space car park , which have outraged residents
