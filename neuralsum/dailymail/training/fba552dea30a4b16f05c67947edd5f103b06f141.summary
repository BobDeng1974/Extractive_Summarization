by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 24 april 2013 images from the archive of a tiny @entity4 computer lab show the incredible technological revolution that has taken place over a single generation			1
from the world 's first programmable computer , created in 1949 , to the chunky first calculator with huge buttons and a chip that led to the @entity14 - the @entity4 lab has pioneered it all			1
and as the lab this year celebrates its 75th anniversary , this collection shows the effect a two man team , set up in 1938 has had on millions worldwide			1
even before it revolutionised the world with the first programmable computer , the lab was the first to use @entity26 firm @entity25 's electric calculating machine , shown in a picture from the lab 's archive below			1
at the time the lab was created , computing was done by people , often mathematically gifted young women who carried out tedious numerical calculations by hand founded in the 1938 as the @entity4 ’s @entity48 with just two men based in an old @entity50 , the lab was today hailed by @entity51 and @entity52 of @entity53 as instrumental in the technological revolution			1
it was one of the first customers of electric calculator , but staff soon invented @entity59 , the first programmable computer ever brought into general service			1
users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper , and the room sized machine measured 5m by 2m - a far cry from today 's handheld gadgets			1
@entity59 was the first of many technological breakthroughs at the lab , including the computer password , the webcam ( developed so engineers could get fresh coffee ) , the @entity75 and the @entity77 chip that powers dozens of smartphones and tablets , including @entity81 's @entity14			1
staff working on @entity59 , the first programmable computer for general use ever built			1
it became operational during 1949 after a three - year construction period at the computer lab at the @entity4 , which is celebrating its 75th birthday the queue to use @entity59 the first microprogrammable computer at the computer lab at the @entity4			1
users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper			0
finished programmes then hung on a line , waiting for machine operators to load them in			0
@entity59 was first introduced in 1949 when it completed its first programmed task by accurately calculating the squares of numbers from 0 to 99			0
the original @entity48 , which opened in 1938 with just two men based in an old @entity50 @entity102 , professor of computer technology and current head of the lab , said : ' i believe that we are completely unique and that there is no other department in the world quite like us			1
' @entity4 is the place where computers became a tool for general use , and the qualities that made that possible have never left us			1
' they made us the biggest wealth conversion engine in the @entity4 cluster and therefore in @entity119			1
' and they have enabled us to achieve more than any other computer science department in the world			2
' in contrast with its humble beginnings , the centre is now home to dozens of staff and hundreds of students and is credited with giving rise to almost 200 technology firms			2
it was where @entity59 , the first programmable computer ever brought into general service , was built			1

founded in the 1938 as the @entity4 ’s @entity48 with just two men based in an old @entity50 , the centre grew to become a world leader and is this week celebrating its anniversary			1
over the decades it has been responsible for developments which contributed to the rise of early home computers and the low power chips used in mobile phones and @entity14			2
the ' @entity48 ' began life as a two - man team , confined to the @entity50 ’s @entity158 , and was charged with providing a resource for solving complex problems by ' numerical methods '			1
when @entity163 , a @entity164 who was to become its first director , submitted proposals for a computing facility in 1936 , the idea was described as ' extraordinary '			0
at the time , a ' computer ' was a person , very frequently a mathematically gifted woman , employed to carry out tedious numerical calculations by hand			2
@entity163 ’ visionary proposal was for a facility that would carry out complicated calculations in support of wider university research , with the human computers using ' recent developments in mechanical and electrical aids to computation '			0
the @entity48 ’s early hardware consisted of these machines , and two analog computers which were designed to solve linear differential equations			0
the @entity187 computer under construction at the lab. @entity187 was the prototype of the @entity192 computer , and was designed starting in 1963 , and in operation from 1964 to 1973			2
one of @entity187 's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse @entity195 of data from the one - mile @entity197			2
the first passwords : the @entity200 computer was the first successful experimental computer that demonstrated the use of security capabilities , both in hardware and software			0
it first became operational in 1976 , using tokens or keys to allow users to access files and other information on the system			0
it greatly improved the security of computing at the lab. the team then went on to address the problem of security , inventing what was in effect the first computer password system			0

one famous by - product of the lab ’s work came when a team of researchers who shared the same coffee pot had decided to keep tabs on whether it was full or not			2
the @entity239 coffee pot was located in the corridor just outside the so - called @entity239 within the old @entity48 of the @entity4			1
however , engineers became bored of pointless trips to the coffee room - and decided a technological solution was the answer			0
they utilised a spare computer to create , on the user 's desktop computer , a live 128 × 128 grayscale picture of the state of the coffee pot. they later created a version in a browser window , becoming the world ’s first web cam			1
the invention was eventually used by others , and paved the way for the explosion in webcams and even videconferencing systems			0
the world 's first webcam : it was created to help people working in other parts of the building avoid pointless trips to the coffee room by providing , on the user 's desktop computer , a live 128 × 128 grayscale picture of the state of the coffee pot fancy a cuppa ? a series of shots from the world 's first webcam			1

one of its more famous spin - off companies was @entity283 , which became a household name after developing the @entity75			1
the prototype of this device was developed in less than a week to meet the demands of the @entity290 ’s nationwide computer literacy campaign			2
@entity283 laid the groundwork to develop a chip which ultimately led to the foundation of @entity294			1
today billions of chips are produced by @entity77 and sold to major clients around the world , featuring in the likes of the @entity14 and @entity299			1

the system was adopted by most schools in the @entity307 , changing @entity283 's fortunes , and was also moderately successful as a home computer in the @entity307 despite its high cost			1
prof @entity102 said the centre had always been driven by a spirit of innovation			0
' today , the establishment mentality seems to be that you can industrialise innovation , or innovate on demand , ' he said			0
' you ca n’t do that any more than you can ask an artist to paint the next brilliant masterpiece			0
' @entity102 , the present director of the @entity48			0
he said the centre had always been driven by a spirit of innovation the @entity323 , where the modern day @entity48 is based the tradition of innovation continued in 2008 when the @entity328 charity was set up to create an ultra-small , cheap computer aimed at encouraging children to learn computer science			0
founded amid concerns that the number of university applicants for the subject across @entity307 was falling , it to some extent echoes the achievements of the @entity75 team at @entity283 almost a quarter of a century earlier			1
@entity340 and @entity341 enjoying their first experience with the @entity328 , a cheap , small device designed to teach children about programming , created by current and former members of the @entity48 ' on behalf of @entity53 , i warmly congratulate the @entity48 on the occasion of its 75th anniversary			0
the @entity48 and @entity53 share a strong tradition in computer science and engineering ; albeit theirs being somewhat longer than ours			0
we also applaud their culture of innovation and we trust that the next 75 years will be as exciting and rewarding as were the first 75			1
' @entity52 , executive chairman , @entity53 ' a key factor in @entity360 's choice for the location of its first research center outside of the @entity363 , was the proximity to @entity4			2
as one of the world ’s best teaching and research universities , with historical links to the founding of computer science , @entity4 ’s @entity48 has been the hub for major advances in computing , including original work in building complete computers and the development of programming languages and operating systems			1
the technologies developed by the @entity4 , @entity380 and other leading technology companies in @entity4 will be fundamental in addressing some of the greatest challenges of this century			2

' the @entity48 has been and continues to be , a world leader in the field of @entity391			0
its strong emphasis on academic excellence and solving real - world problems produces top graduates and post-graduates ready to work in world - leading technology companies			2
@entity399 values the opportunity to sponsor and collaborate with excellent students and faculty in the @entity48 and would like to congratulate the lab on reaching this historic milestone			0
we look forward to many more years of collaboration			0
