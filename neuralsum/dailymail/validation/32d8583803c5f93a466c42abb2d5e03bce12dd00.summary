four years after undergoing brain surgery , @entity1 @entity0 has a golden opportunity to put the seal on his heartening recovery by claiming the biggest title of his career on sunday			1
the huge - hitting @entity9 native served notice he was bang in form when he opened up the @entity12 here with a startling round of 62 – described by @entity15 on @entity1 television on saturday as one of the great rounds of the last 20 years			1
it seemed to catch up with @entity0 when he put four balls into the water on friday and started with an ugly three putt from just 5ft at the first hole of his third round			1
@entity0 acknowledges the crowd after making a hole - in - one during saturday 's round @entity0 , who leads the @entity12 by five shots , had brain surgery four years ago for the first time since thursday he did not own the lead outright and , with players of the calibre of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 champion @entity38 lurking , there were fears he would fall back still further			1
but the 32 year old showed commendable resolve to put that opening hole mistake behind him and play wonderfully patient golf thereafter to finish up with a 70 on saturday and establish a commanding five shot advantage			0
with @entity36 and @entity38 his nearest pursuers , @entity0 wo n’t be spending the mammoth £ 1.25 million first prize just yet			1
but the manner in which he finished off his round , with four birdies in a row from the 14th hole , augurs well for his chances			0
@entity53 is best placed of the @entity54 in 8th place but a long way off the pace , at eight shots behind			1
@entity59 is no fewer than 11 strokes adrift and admitted he had little to play for but a top five finish in the final round			0
the big - hitting @entity0 looks delighted after becoming the second man to ace the 14th in 30 minutes after a difficult start on saturday @entity0 remained patient to hold onto his lead going into the final round ‘ i felt like i hit it a little better but my iron play is still not as sharp as i would like it to be , ’ said the world no 1			1
an unusually wet and windy third round made it tough for the players , with only @entity36 ( 69 ) managing to break 70 among the last 12 groups			1
yet there were a remarkable number of perfect shots played			2
take the par three fourth , a hole so long and difficult there had n’t been a hole in one there for 26 years			0
yet on this day , almost unbelievably , there were two in the space of 30 minutes , as first @entity36 holed his tee shot , to be followed by the leader himself shortly afterwards			2
he might have had an ace but @entity0 would get to the 14th without a birdie on his card			2
at that point , however , he broadened his shoulders and put together his brilliant finish that has left the tournament as one for him to win or lose on sunday			0
@entity36 , who is @entity0 ' closest threat , eyes up a put during saturday 's round @entity36 also aced the 14th , but is five shots behind @entity0 , alongsided @entity101 ' champion @entity38 after shooting an 80 in the @entity102 in 2011 @entity0 withdrew and , suffering from vertigo symptoms , went to see a neurologist			1
he was eventually diagnosed with structural defects in his cerebellum and underwent two gruelling bouts of surgery			0
last may , @entity0 confirmed his full recovery with an emotional victory in the @entity111 in @entity112			2
now he has the chance to register an even more prestigious victory			0
the huge advantage this @entity117 course offers the big hitters was made plain by the identities of the top three			2
in fact , they might be the three biggest hitters in the modern game			0
@entity53 is the best - placed @entity124 , but his eight shots back and tied for eighth place after three rounds @entity36 and @entity38 are showing just why they will be heavily favoured at the masters next month , when the latter will be trying to win a third green jacket in four years			1
if he shows the same gossamer touch as he has here , he must have a great chance			0
he is the only player in the field to break par in every round			0
@entity53 is playing in his 50th @entity12 event but it is a long shot that it will end in his first victory			1
still , he is showing good form as well heading to @entity143			0
@entity144 stands alongside @entity53 , with @entity146 @entity145 a further shot off the lead			2
but @entity149 @entity148 , runner - up here last year , fell away following a disappointing round of 76 .			0

@entity1 big - hitter @entity0 leads @entity12
@entity0 five clear of @entity36 and @entity38 after three rounds
@entity53 in eighth place , eight shots behind @entity0
