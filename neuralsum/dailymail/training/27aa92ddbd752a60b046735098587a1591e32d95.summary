early man : a third of people in modern @entity3 show genetic traces of populations from @entity6 , leading researchers to conclude that people migrated between the continents as early as 11,000 years ago people moved between @entity6 and @entity3 long before recorded history - and the migrations might have been driven by @entity3 moving south to ' weather ' ice ages			1
the genetic traces of long - forgotten migrations from @entity6 to @entity3 live on in @entity3 today			1
a third of the genetic traces of @entity6 lineages in today 's @entity3 come from prehistory			1
researchers think that @entity3 ' pushed south ' by glaciers might have met with populations from @entity6			1
people moved between the continents as early as 11,000 years ago			2
geneticists used mitochondrial dna to look for the traces of ancient migrations			0
mitochondrial dna is passed directly from mother to child with no dna from the father - and tiny changes in the sequence come to ' characterise ' different populations , which can be used to trace movements and migrations of groups of humans in the past			0
large numbers of people moved between @entity6 and @entity3 during recent and well - documented time periods such as the @entity45 , the @entity47 conquest , and the slave trade - but the researchers found that a third of @entity6 lineages came from before these movements			2
' it was very surprising to find that more than 35 percent of the @entity6 lineages in @entity3 arrived during a period that ranged from more than 11,000 years ago to the @entity45 times , ' said dr. @entity55 of the @entity56 and senior author of the study			1
' the other 65 % of @entity3 haplogroup l lineages arrived in more recent times			0
' the authors explain that these contacts likely connected @entity6 to @entity3 not only via @entity63 , but also directly by coastal routes			0
@entity55 said that it still remains unknown why there was genetic flow between the @entity6 and @entity3 in prehistoric times			2
one possible scenario is that some bidirectional flow was promoted when the last glaciation pushed some @entity3 southward , until the glacier receded and populations returned north			0
in addition to tracing the genetic links of @entity6 and @entity3 back to prehistoric times , @entity55 expects that their work will also help those individuals who want to learn more about their own ancestry .			0

people migrated between 11,000 years ago and start of @entity45
35 per cent of @entity6 genetic traces in @entity3 are from prehistory
were @entity3 ' pushed south ' by ice ages ?
