an allotment holder who tends to his plot all year round has been landed with an eviction order - because he took a fortnight off			1
@entity5 , who has tended to the plot for the past eight years , received a letter from the council giving him a month 's notice on the tenancy after claiming he was not ' cultivating the plot to the required standards '			1
the 64 - year - old grandfather admits he took a two - week break from tending his plot in @entity17 allotments , @entity18 , @entity19 - but only because of heavy storms and rain			1
he said : ' for about two weeks we could n't get on to the ground at all			2
there had been a lot of wet and stormy weather and it would have done more harm than good			0
' facing eviction : @entity5 , 64 , received a letter from @entity31 telling him he is being evicted from his allotment for failing to ' cultivate the plot to the required standards ' keen gardener : mr @entity5 says he tends his allotment all year round - growing vegetables and herbs - but admits to having had two weeks off over winter when heavy gales meant he could n't work on the plot mr @entity5 responded to the letter with a detailed account of the vegetables grown on the plot and fruit trees that his wife @entity46 uses to make jams , but received no response from @entity49			1
he added : ' after i received the notice i worked the land for two days and dug up some plants to give them away			2
' the land was 80 per cent cultivated anyway because we grow a lot of fruit and flowers for the house			2
i took photographs to show the condition after two days but have had no response			0
' in the first instance i thought it was a genuine mistake			0
i thought they 've got the wrong allotment and that it would be sorted out			2
but after sending two emails i 've heard nothing from the council and as far as i 'm aware the notice still stands			1
' the letter sent to mr @entity5 , an aerial and satellite rigger , who grows a vast array of herbs , fruits and vegetables on the plot , also had three photos attached to support the eviction			1
but mr @entity5 said the pictures were taken during the winter when the allotment was dormant , with some photos actually showing an overgrown tree outside the boundaries of his plot			1
he added : ' the pictures they took were just dried plants , which you ca n't do anything about in the winter			1
the council must have come to plot on the first dry day of the year to take the photograph			2
working progress : mr @entity5 has been slowly cultivating his plot over the course of eight years stunned : mr @entity5 initially thought his eviction notice must be a mistake after receiving this letter from @entity49 evidence : @entity49 attached three images with the letter as proof that the plot in @entity17 allotments , @entity18 , was not being ' cultivated ' ' i get a lot of use from the allotment and my grandchildren love it too			1
they do n't come to help , they come to eat peas off the pod and grow sunflowers			0
i just do n't want to lose it			0
' mr @entity5 said he will do everything he can to keep the plot which has become a ' huge part ' of his life			1
he said : ' the letter broke my spirit , if i 'm honest			0
i 've had no response from the @entity31 , and the thought of having to leave is absolutely devastating			0
' at the moment i am digging my heels in until someone puts pen to paper and informs me what 's happening			0
' i plan to fight my cause , but i hope common sense will prevail			0
i 'm just an ordinary man who enjoys growing and planting things , but i 'm here every week , and my allotment is a huge part of my life			0
' @entity138 has said it has revamped its allotment services , speeding up the process of transforming derelict or vacant sites to reduce waiting lists			0
devastated : mr @entity5 , pictured in his plot , goes to the allotment every week and says he does n't want to lose such a ' huge part ' of his life waiting game : mr @entity5 has sent a letter of appeal to the council but has still not been told whether it was successful but @entity152 , from the @entity153 , which allocates temporary starter plots at the @entity17 allotments in @entity18 , said that while recent improvements in certain council services had been welcomed , communication problems still existed			1
' we all want uncultivated plots to be moved on swiftly , but the process has to be effective , ' she said			0
' this case emphasises how important it is to be careful and get things right			0
some long - standing plot holders who have received warnings about their level of cultivation felt the letters were both unprecedented and heavy - handed			1
' @entity171 , @entity49 's operational estate manager , said 32 tenancies had been terminated so far during 2013/14 , with approximately ten of those evictions leading to appeals			2
' there are waiting lists for council allotments and we have a duty to make sure that those who have plots are actually working them , ' she said			0
prior to any termination notice being issued plot holders are given a written warning and advised that improvement is required			2
ms @entity171 continued : ' the termination of mr @entity5 's tenancy will be put on hold to allow time for his appeal to be determined			1
' productive : mr @entity5 's wife @entity46 even makes her own jam with fruit from trees in the allotment varied selection : @entity199 's collection of jams she made using fruit growing at the allotment			1

@entity5 , 64 , grows a selection of vegetable and herbs at his allotment
but @entity49 sent him an eviction notice because his plot was not ' cultivated to the required standards
they sent pictures taken during the winter to support the eviction notice
mr @entity5 admits taking two weeks off - during *severe* gales and heavy rain
he is appealing the eviction notice but has n't heard back from the council
