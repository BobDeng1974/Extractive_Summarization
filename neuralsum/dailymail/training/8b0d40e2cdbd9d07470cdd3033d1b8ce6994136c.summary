by @entity1 reporter her career has spanned decades , survived fashions and struggled through a variety of public relations disasters			0
but last night hundreds of die - hard @entity7 fans abandoned their queen of pop by marching out of @entity11 's @entity10 during her @entity13 concert - some branding it the worst they had ever seen			1
even a sexy striptease on stage left fans cold - one simply stated : ' when @entity7 has concerts in her 50s where she strips herself on stage , you know her career is as dead as myspace			2
' scroll down for the video shot herself in the foot ? fans branded @entity7 's @entity10 gig the worst concert ever and hundreds walked out many fans decided they did not want to stick around to watch the finale as of the poor sound quality , terrible weather and @entity7 's failure to perform more of her classic hits			1
one reviewer even said at one point @entity7 screamed : ' we love you @entity41 ' , which if it was a joke fell flat on an already less than enthusiastic audience			0
others said a 10.30pm curfew imposed by @entity47 meant @entity7 was forced to start her performance early , in broad daylight , which meant the elaborate staging was lost to some of the audience			1
raunchy : even a sensual performance by @entity7 and her toyboy lover @entity54 failed to impress @entity55 got the nipple , @entity11 got the fishnet strip : @entity7 performs a strip tease during her concert ' worst gig ever ' : even @entity7 's energetic performances with a variety of props did n't win round many earlier her management admitted it had failed to sell all the tickets for the concert - @entity7 's first in @entity67 for four years			1
it is believed some fans were put off by the £ 77 for the open air show			1
a number of fans later complained on @entity73 about the show			0
one user , @entity75 , tweeted : ' worst gig i have ever seen			0
' @entity77 wrote : ' @entity7 left early , ' adding later : ' i mourn those vintage @entity7 days ... where potty mouth and violent imagery was n't necessary			0
just good vibes and great music ! ' not impressed : users took to @entity73 to vent their frustrations over the @entity13 performance @entity85 said : ' when @entity7 has concerts in her 50s where she strips herself on stage , you know her career is as dead as myspace			1
' @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity97 star @entity96 were among celebrities seen watching the show - which finished just moments before the 10.30pm curfew imposed by @entity47			2
her sexy strip took place while she sang @entity103 in front of the 50,000 - strong crowd			0
@entity7 , 53 , peeled off her clothing to reveal a sheer bra and black lacy thong , which she wore under fishnet tights			0
jumping through hoops : some fans resisted the urge to slate @entity7 though and tweeted that she was excellent poor sound quality : @entity7 's show started in daylight and many complained they could n't hear properly her toyboy boyfriend @entity54 , who was on stage as a backing dancer , then helped to fasten a corset around her			1
she told the audience : ' i like to live dangerously			0
' @entity7 also introduced her 11 - year - old son @entity124 , who joined her as a dancer during the gig			2
as well as performing hits like @entity129 , @entity127 and @entity128 , she also showcased tracks from her latest album @entity13			2
next time ! @entity7 was slated for not performing enough of her back catalogue breath of fresh air : @entity7 's aide carries an oxygen machine out of her house ahead of the yesterday 's show high expectations : fans arrive for concert yesterday in @entity10 , many dressed like the star she made a dig at pop rival @entity146 by incorporating her track @entity147 during a rendition of @entity150			1
not all fans were disappointed			0
tv and radio presenter @entity152 tweeted : ' i can definitely say , that was the best live show i have ever seen ! mesmerising from start to finish ! amaaaazin ! ' @entity7 's press spokeswoman @entity158 , was unavailable for comment about the mass walk - out			1
a colleague said : ' she is out doing @entity7 - related stuff			0

even a strip tease failed to impress many fans at the @entity10 @entity13 concert
fans blamed a 10.30pm curfew , poor sound quality , rain and a failure to perform hits from back catalogue for dismal concert
