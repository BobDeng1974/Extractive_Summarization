prime minister @entity0 is under pressure to scrap the controversial fixed - term parliament act @entity0 is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the government 's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years			1
the minister who oversaw the legislation said it would make it all but impossible for either mr @entity0 or @entity13 leader @entity12 to run a minority government if they fail to win a @entity16 majority next year - as polls currently suggest is likely			1
@entity18 , speaking ahead of a debate on the issue by @entity21 , said few had appreciated the long - term impact of the constitutional change , which means prime ministers no longer have the power to call an election when opinion polls are favourable			1
instead , they need to win the support of a ' super majority ' of two - thirds of mps for an election to be held at any time outside of a five - year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would be handing a decision on timing to his or her opponents			1
critics say the legislation , cooked up to keep the current coalition together , is therefore a recipe for never - ending coalition government			1
veteran conservative mp sir @entity45 , who will lead a revolt in the @entity16 in a debate on thursday , insisted his party should commit to scrapping the legislation			0
' we 've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility , ' he said			0
' it was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition , supposedly to stop one party walking off , rather than any good constitutional innovation			0
five - year parliaments are too long			0
' in an interview with the @entity62 , mr @entity18 , who was in charge of constitutional reform as @entity67 's @entity66 deputy at the @entity68 , and was appointed as work and pensions minister in mr @entity0 's last reshuffle , said : ' in the past , you could run a minority government for a short period of time and then have an election			1
' the problem now is that you need to be able and prepared to govern on that basis for an entire five - year parliament			0
you ca n't run a minority government for a short period of time and then hold another election			1
you would either have to do a coalition again , or at the least a formal arrangement that could last for five years with a smaller party			0
' i do n't think a lot of people have cottoned on to this fact			0
' mr @entity18 's warning is a blow to senior figures in both the conservatives and @entity13 who are determined to prevent another coalition after next year 's election , despite polls indicating another hung parliament is likely			2
some of mr @entity12 's closest allies in the shadow @entity121 , meanwhile , suggest @entity13 should not enter coalition with the @entity123 if it emerges as the biggest party but does not secure a majority , also with the aim of calling a rapid second general election in the hope of winning outright			2
while this was always possible in the past , mr @entity18 said the fixed term parliament law passed by the coalition - designed to be a ' lock ' on the government to prevent either the @entity134 or the @entity123 walking and triggering an election - would make such a course politically perilous today			1
' you now need to have mps representing two - thirds of seats - not just the mps voting - wanting to have an election			2
if you look at history back to @entity144 , that means you would have to have the opposition and the governing party agreeing at the same time to call an election - something not likely to happen			0
' veteran @entity66 mp sir @entity45 , who will lead a revolt in the @entity16 in a debate on thursday , insisted his party should commit to scrapping the legislation other than gaining the support of a super majority of two - thirds of all mps , the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence			1
but other parties then have a two - week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held			0
' so if you try to run a minority administration , there 's then always the chance that somebody else can put together a government , ' mr @entity18 added			1
supporters of @entity110 have floated the idea of trying to install him as @entity66 leader in the event of mr @entity0 again failing to win an overall majority the minister said that simply scrapping the act would not be a solution			2
the old right a prime minister had to call an election when he or she wanted was a prerogative power granted by the @entity189 , and once abolished these can not be resurrected without new legislation			0
' if you simply repeal the @entity182 , you are left in a position where there is no power for anyone to dissolve @entity197 , ' mr @entity18 added			0
' you would need detailed legislation setting out new rules			0
even if the previous system was better , the idea that you could actually argue as the governing party that it was better to give yourselves the exclusive power to call an election back again , and that everybody else would go along with that ... i just ca n't see it happening			0
' the minister said the fixed term parliament reforms that had been introduced were a ' recipe for coalition or for parties winning majorities '			2
the suggestion that mr @entity0 and his @entity123 deputy @entity67 have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some mps who had not appreciated their long - term implications			1
some senior @entity134 , including at least two cabinet ministers , believe mr @entity0 should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in may 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in october of that year			1
one conservative mp sceptical about the coalition said : ' the coalition was a mistake in the first place , and now @entity0 and @entity67 are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders			2

@entity0 faces pressure to scrap government 's fixed - term ruling
it would mean general elections only take place once every five years
legislation would make it all but impossible to run a minority government
mp @entity18 said *pms* would need to win ' super majority ' of two - thirds
critics say legislation is a recipe for ' never - ending coalition government '
