click here to see @entity3 's full @entity2 player ratings from @entity4 job done , boxed ticked			1
@entity2 finally registered the win they craved but huge questions remain over @entity9 ’s team and their ability to challenge at next year ’s @entity11			1
this was always going to be a thankless task against cash - strapped opponents whose preparation was overshadowed by their ongoing dispute with a dysfunctional union which nearly led to the players boycotting the match			1
but there was an opportunity to show progress had been made and lessons had been learned following a dismal start to the autumn series			2
in the end they did enough , just			2
replacements : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			2
@entity33 : @entity63 7 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 5 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 ( capt 6 ) , @entity68 6 , @entity69 8 ; @entity70 5 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 5 , @entity73 7 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 7 , @entity76 6 , @entity77 8			1
replacements : 16 @entity79 , 17 @entity80 , 18 @entity81 , 19 @entity82 , 20 @entity83 , 21 @entity84 , 22 @entity85 , 23 @entity86			0
match ratings by @entity3 at @entity4 three tries , two of them in an improved second - half performance , were the least @entity2 would have expected following criticism of their attacking efforts in the @entity95 international defeats against @entity96 and @entity97			1
the experiment of playing @entity34 at fly - half , with the misfiring @entity43 shifted to inside centre , was no more than a partial success			1
@entity105 , on his first start for @entity2 , was quietly impressive , riding thunderous tackles — one of which led to a yellow card for @entity33 centre @entity110 — to finish the game comfortably in credit			1
the 21 - year - old amassed 13 points , landing five kicks from seven attempts , and played a hand in @entity2 ’s first two tries			1
he will surely start against @entity120 in the pivotal no 10 position next saturday			0
@entity9 said : ‘ there ’s a lot of pressure to come on and run a game but i thought @entity34 did it well			1
he looked incisive in his line breaks , he ’s got a great eye for the gap and his kicking game was good			0
he took some hits and showed a great deal of bravery			0
it was a really positive first start for him			0
‘ we have a selection decision to make but from my point of view he ’s been waiting patiently for his chance and he ’s put a real marker down			0
’ whether @entity43 starts alongside him is less certain			2
fortunate to retain his place following two under - par displays , the 23 - year - old made a couple of neat contributions yesterday , including a cleverly weighted pass from a wrap - around move which led to the first of @entity28 ’s two tries			1
but the jury remains out			0
his kicking remains a concern and his lack of confidence is evident			0
the pair will need time to forge an understanding at 10 and 12 — time @entity2 may not have with nine games left before the @entity11			2
@entity2 will point to the fact two of their three tries were scored by left wing may , while his fellow wing @entity41 set up @entity40 ’s try following a brilliant cross-field kick by @entity105			1
but too much of the team ’s play was stuttering and lacking cohesion			0
the @entity2 team walk through crowds of supporters after arriving at @entity4 @entity2 coach @entity9 watches as his players warm up ahead of the @entity171 @entity2 players watch as @entity33 perform their traditional @entity174 war dance ahead of the game @entity105 ( left ) replaced childhood friend @entity43 at fly - half as both men speak to the referee may picks up the ball from @entity40 and powers through the @entity33 defence may ( centre ) uses his blistering pace to score @entity2 's first try after good work from from @entity43 and @entity186 may crosses the line before the referee confirms there was no forward pass and the try stands may ( centre ) raises his fist in the year after scoring his second international try @entity2 @entity33 3 tries 0 2 conversions 0 3 penalty goals 3 0 drop goals 0 131 tackles 71 11 missed tackles 18 71 carries 127 332 metres 367 18 defenders beaten 11 5 @entity197 4 6 offload 12 35 kicks from @entity199 @entity200 conceded 10 14 penalties conceded 12 0 yellow cards 1 0 @entity203 0 7 of 7 scrums won 6 of 8 18 of 19 @entity205 8 of 12 53 of 57 @entity206 97 of 98 42.0 % possession 58.0 % 42.0 % territory 58.0 % coming into the game with five successive losses behind them , and five changes in personnel , it was understandable that nerves would play a part in the early stages			1
but the first 40 minutes will not live long in the memory — bar may ’s well - worked try — as @entity2 again produced an error - strewn display that saw them go in 13 - 6 up at half - time			1
mercifully they picked up their game in the second half as @entity105 kicked deeper into @entity33 territory but , with their vastly superior conditioning and preparation , @entity2 should have pulled clear with far more authority than they did			1
@entity9 ’s men blew three clear try - scoring chances , full back @entity40 dropping two and lock @entity48 knocking on with the line at his mercy minutes from time after another sharp break from @entity105			1
they would surely have been punished against better opposition			0
@entity9 added : ‘ i ’m obviously pleased to get the win because it ’s been a while coming			0
i ’m delighted first and foremost with that and also really pleased with the performances of some young players who are making early starts in their careers			0
‘ it was a shame we did n’t take some of those opportunities at the end			0
they ’re the ones we will need to take against @entity120			0
’ @entity9 and his coaching team were taken aback by the ferocity of the criticism following the first two defeats of the autumn but , make no mistake , losing next week to a tired and under - strength @entity120 outfit would leave him facing a horrendous build - up to the @entity255			2
no one doubts the work ethic or desire of the coach or his team but only consistently high - quality , high - tempo displays will keep the wolves at bay and avoid a scenario like yesterday when a near capacity crowd resorted to the dreaded @entity267 wave less than 15 minutes in			2
it was a clear sign they were bored			0
no amount of invented pageantry or heavy handed marketing can replace the crowd ’s desire for blood and thunder on the pitch			0
as @entity50 said this week , no one will remember how good @entity2 ’s culture is if they do n’t win any matches			2
they will need to improve to beat the @entity120 next week			0
too many players failed to leave a mark on this game , with @entity50 knocking on too often , @entity53 struggling to make an impact and @entity42 unable to provide any real thrust alongside @entity34 and @entity43 in the outside centre position			1
scrum - half @entity44 was quiet while hooker @entity46 did not carry as @entity288 may have hoped			1
@entity40 was also guilty of those two dropped passes when the try line was in view , although his pass to set up may ’s second was sweetly executed and he otherwise enjoyed a tidy game			2
but tidy is not enough for @entity2			2
they need to demonstrate an ability to tear sides to pieces			0
there is little threat of that at the moment			0
@entity34 impressed as @entity2 grew into the game in the second half @entity2 's @entity45 ( centre ) almost becomes separated from his shirt during a scrum @entity41 races towards the touchline after being released by a superb kick by @entity105 @entity40 ( centre ) takes @entity41 's pass to score @entity2 's second try shortly after the interval @entity2 team - mates rush to congratulate @entity40 after he crosses over for @entity2 's second try may takes his international tally of tries to three after scoring his second may touches the ball down before he can be caught by @entity33 's defence may knocks the ball into the crowd after sending @entity2 on their way to victory			1

@entity2 defeated @entity33 28 - 9 in their @entity326 at @entity4
@entity28 used his blistering pace to score two tries as the @entity330 avoided their worst run of results since 2006
@entity34 impressed on his full international debut at fly - half with @entity43 moved *infield*
a superb kick from @entity105 to @entity41 led to @entity40 scoring @entity2 's second try after the interval
