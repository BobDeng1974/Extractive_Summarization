@entity1 's goal earned @entity2 a 1 - 1 draw at @entity4 in the first leg of their @entity7 play - off semi-final			1
@entity10 's 33rd goal of the season should have been ruled out for offside but it gave @entity4 the lead going into half - time at @entity15			1
however , @entity1 levelled things up midway through the second half to leave the tie in the balance ahead of the second leg in east @entity15 on tuesday night			1

@entity58 got behind the @entity4 defence and his strike partner @entity78 was inches away from getting a touch to his shot - cum - cross as he slid in at the far post			1
however , @entity4 settled after that early scare and went ahead after 16 minutes			1
@entity34 's shot from just outside the area was parried by @entity49 into the path of @entity29 , who fired the ball back across the face of goal for @entity38 to head home from close range			0
the visitors appealed for offside but no flag was forthcoming from the assistant referee , who was brilliantly positioned			0
television replays showed @entity38 was just offside			0
@entity2 were nearly level straight away			2
hesitant defending resulted in the ball being cleared from just in front of his goalline by @entity32			0
a superb tackle at full stretch by @entity50 denied @entity38 another clear sight of goal after 27 minutes			0
heads up : @entity10 scores the opener for @entity4 in the 16th minute at @entity15 on your marks : @entity38 celebrates scoring the @entity107 play - off semi-final first leg a two - goal deficit would have been harsh on the visitors , who had responded well to falling behind			1
the remainder of the first half belonged to them and twice they came close to an equaliser as half - time approached			0
@entity60 's header was cleared inside the six - yard box by @entity31 after @entity28 made a mess of trying to punch a long throw into the penalty area			0
however , the goalkeeper made amends shortly afterwards when he came rushing from his line to block another @entity60 effort			0
@entity4 had chances to extend their lead early in the second half but @entity38 shot straight at @entity49 and @entity41 curled a shot agonisingly wide			2
incoming : @entity2 's @entity50 ( left ) looks to make the challenge on @entity41 pass : @entity2 's @entity55 plays the ball as @entity4 's @entity31 looks on making their feelings known : @entity4 fans protest about the proposed league 3 plans @entity4 had looked fragile in the centre of defence all afternoon and @entity2 's equaliser came from that area of the pitch in the 72nd minute			1
former @entity4 striker @entity59 won a header against two defenders inside the box to give @entity57 the chance to shoot			2
his curler was palmed away by @entity28 but @entity1 was on hand to tap in the rebound			2
@entity2 sensed they might be able to take more than a draw back to the @entity152 for the second leg and @entity28 produced a great save at his near post to deny @entity60			1
the @entity155 then had to repel another @entity60 attempt after the midfielder was given too much space on the edge of the box			0
