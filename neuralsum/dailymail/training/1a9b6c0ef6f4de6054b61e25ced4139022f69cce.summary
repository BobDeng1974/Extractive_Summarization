battle for business : shoppers will be able to pick up last minute festive treats from midnight on the morning of @entity3 at some @entity1 stores as a result shoppers will be able to tour the aisles , buying their turkey and all the trimmings , in the early hours of december 24 for the first time at the chain			1

this year december 23 - normally the busiest food shopping day of the year - falls on a sunday			1

@entity34 has also extended its opening hours in the run up to @entity3 chancellor @entity15 has refused pleas from a number of retailers to suspend the sunday trading restrictions this year			1
this coincides with the fact that stores are already struggling for sales against online rivals and amid a spending squeeze			0
