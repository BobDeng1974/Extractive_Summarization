by @entity0 following a successful trial in the @entity2 , @entity4 users in the @entity5 can now choose from one of 70 gender options , including ' asexual ' , ' two - spirit ' , ' intersex ' and ' cisgender			1
' before the changes , only male and female options were available on the gender tab in profiles			2
@entity4 has also updated its settings so users can choose a neutral pronoun , meaning they are referred to as ' they , their or them '			1
@entity4 came up with its range of terms after consulting with leading gay and transgender activists , and the company plans to continue working with them @entity4 rolled out the changes to its more than 159 million monthly users in the @entity2 in february			1
the changes are aimed at giving people more choices in how they describe themselves , such as androgynous , bi-gender , intersex , gender fluid or transsexual			2
' there 's going to be a lot of people for whom this is going to mean nothing , but for the few it does impact , it means the world , ' said @entity4 software engineer @entity47			1
@entity48 worked on the project and is herself undergoing gender transformation , from male to female			0
' all too often transgender people like myself and other gender nonconforming people are given this binary option , do you want to be male or female ? what is your gender ? , ' said @entity48			0
' and it 's kind of disheartening because none of those let us tell others who we really are , ' she said			0
' this really changes that and for the first time i get to go to the site and specify to all the people i know what my gender is			0
' @entity76 ( people who lack a gender ) @entity78 / androgynous ( a ' non-binary ' gender			0

' an important part of this is the expression of gender especially when it extends beyond the definitions of just " male " or " female "			0
today â€™s announcement provides significantly more options for people in the @entity5			0
' @entity4 , which has 1.23 billion active monthly users around the world , also allows them to keep their gender identity private , and will continue to do so			1
the @entity208 last year found that 10 percent of the 10,000 lesbian , gay , bisexual transgender youths it surveyed used ' other ' or wrote in their own gender terms			1
when a @entity4 user customises their gender , they can also choose a preferred pronoun so that third party apps and messages from @entity4 will be addressed in the right way			1
there is currently no way for advertisers to target specific groups based on the ' custom ' settings on @entity4			2
@entity4 rolled out the changes to its more than 159 million monthly users in the @entity2 in february			1
the changes are aimed at giving people more choices in how they describe themselves , such as androgynous , bi-gender , intersex , gender fluid or transsexual ( pictured )			0
flags at @entity4 's headquarters in february , celebrating the move to improve the site 's gender selection			1
the changes were initially rolled out in the @entity2 , and will start appearing for @entity5 users over the coming weeks the change to the gender selection option is seen as a major step toward acceptance for people who do n't self - identify as male or female , but the high - profile development seemed senseless to those who believe in two genders , no more			0
' of course @entity4 is entitled to manage its wildly popular site as it sees fit , but here is the bottom line : it 's impossible to deny the biological reality that humanity is divided into two halves - male and female , ' said @entity256 , an issues analyst for @entity257 , an influential national religious organisation based in @entity258			1
' those petitioning for the change insist that there are an infinite number of genders , but just saying it does n't make it so			0
' that said , we have a great deal of compassion for those who reject their biological sex and believe they are the opposite sex			0
@entity4 software engineer @entity47 demonstrates the expanded options for gender identification at her company 's @entity277 headquarters			1
@entity48 , who helped engineer the project , plans to switch her identifier to ' @entity133 ' @entity281 , executive director of the @entity283 - based @entity282 , said it may be hard for some people to understand the importance of having the ability to select from multiple genders online			0
but he said many transgender people will be thrilled with the change			0
' we applaud @entity4 for making it possible for people to be their authentic selves online , ' he said			2
in the past decade , the transgender movement has become much more organised and outspoken , demanding the kind of civil rights and respect already sought by gay activists			1
' during this time , the transgender umbrella has been growing well beyond transsexuals to encompass a wide variety of gender identities			0
the move by @entity4 came after years of lobbying from users , some who started @entity4 pages to petition for the change			2
@entity310 offers male , female and ' other ' as choices , but transgender advocates said @entity4 's many specific options puts the platform well ahead of any other online community			1
about 1 per cent of @entity310 users identify as ' other '			0
@entity4 has also updated its settings so users can choose a neutral pronoun ( pictured )			1
unlike getting engaged or married , changing gender is not registered as a ' life event ' and wo n't post on timelines			0
@entity4 said advertisers can not target ads to those who declare themselves transgender or recently changed gender the idea of expanding gender choices percolated at @entity4 for about a year and started to come to fruition during an in - house brainstorming four months ago , project manager @entity331 said			2
unlike getting engaged or married , changing gender is not registered as a ' life event ' on the site and wo n't post on timelines			0
therefore , @entity4 said advertisers can not target ads to those who declare themselves transgender or recently changed their gender			2
users also can select ' neither ' or ' other ' and separately indicate whether they want to be referred to as he , she or they			2
@entity4 came up with its range of terms after consulting with leading gay and transgender activists , and the company plans to continue working with them .			1

new options include ' asexual ' , ' cisgender , ' ' transgender ' and ' intersex '
