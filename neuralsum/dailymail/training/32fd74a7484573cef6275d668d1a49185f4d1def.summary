by @entity0 an angry mother who took on @entity2 over their failure to stock @entity5 figures for girls has won her battle to get princess @entity9 toys in stores			1
@entity11 of @entity12 , north - east @entity13 , took to @entity14 to vent her fury after discovering @entity16 only sold figures of the male characters from the classic films			1
her comments spiralled into a huge online campaign that has this week seen @entity2 relent and agree and to add princess @entity9 toys to its merchandise			1
campaign : londoner @entity11 was shocked to discover that @entity16 did not stock princess @entity9 figures for her six - year - old daughter , @entity26 's , birthday party ms @entity28 was shocked at @entity2 's reply to her @entity14 request and started a campaign for girls ' toys the issue came to light after ms @entity11 , 42 , organised a @entity5 - themed birthday party for her six - year - old daughter @entity26 and four - year - old son , @entity38			1
while she found her local @entity2 store stocked figures of all the film 's male characters , such as @entity43 and @entity44 , she could not find any princess @entity45			1
ms @entity11 told @entity46 : ' i was passing the store in @entity49 and noticed they had a new @entity5 range out			1
' they are fabulous dolls - they are large , interactive and speak quotes from the films			0
@entity26 , six , in her bedroom with @entity5 posters on the wall			0
she was desperate for a princess @entity9 doll @entity38 , pictured in his bedroom , got the doll he wanted			0
his mother @entity60 thinks @entity2 is making decisions about what girls and boys like and do n't allow the children to decide for themselves ' i wanted to get a doll for both my children , but none of them were of female characters - and certainly not princess @entity9 , who was noticeably absent			1
' as soon as @entity38 opened his ( doll ) , @entity26 said " i want a @entity9 one "			0
' i knew she was going to say it			0
there was an anticipation that she was going to get one , but i knew i could n't fulfill it			2
' she was so excited , but when i had to tell her they do n't do princess @entity9 dolls , she was absolutely crushed			2
' ms @entity11 said it was ' very tricky ' explaining to her daughter why no female @entity5 characters were available			1
' you do nâ€™t want to be having these conversations with your child when they are that young about why they have not included princess @entity9 alongside all the male characters			0
' it 's really uncomfortable			0
we felt betrayed and shut out by @entity2			2
' she believes gender labelling could have a negative effect on children			2
@entity16 only stocked toys related to @entity5 ' male characters @entity44 , played by @entity102 ( left ) , and @entity43 , played by @entity103 ( right ) , but not princess @entity9 , played by @entity104 ' on the @entity2 website , all the @entity5 toys are categorised and nearly all are for boys			1
i think @entity2 are a bit behind the times			2
' they are making decisions about what girls and boys like and do n't allow the children to decide for themselves			1
' it 's self - fulfilling if @entity2 tells you something is not for you - it means you do n't build it up as a passion			2
' i 'm worried it has an impact on what choices they make for themselves later in life and how they are perceived by other people			0
when she tweeted the store to complain , she received the reply : ' currently , there are no plans for @entity9 products at the @entity133 , @entity60			1
have a wonderful day ! ' a toy shop stocking dolls and toys for girls and boys including @entity5 ' @entity139 ( right )			0
ms @entity11 's campaign has now gone escalated after the # wewantleia hash - tag took off the reply sparked a global online campaign using the hastag ' # @entity145 ' and a petition to have toys from the films aimed at girls stocked in the shops			1
after weeks of pressure , @entity2 was forced into a u-turn this week and agreed to bring in the toys			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the current assortment of @entity5 products at the @entity133 launched earlier this year , and is just the beginning of what is to come			2
' we 're excited to be rolling out new products in the coming months , including several items that will feature princess @entity9 , one of the most iconic characters in the @entity5			0
' celebrating the news on @entity14 , earlier this week , ms @entity11 wrote : ' thank you so much everyone who supported # @entity145			1
we did it ! ! ' she thinks @entity2 may bring out the @entity9 dolls in time for @entity169			2
i was disheartened in the middle of it all , but my husband said at least people are talking about it , ' she said			0
@entity11 's crusade against @entity2 is not the first time children 's toys have sparked a sexism row			1
in november , @entity181 removed ' girls ' and ' boys ' signs from its toy departments following a sustained campaign from a parent - led action group			0
let toys be toys , which campaigns against gender stereotyping , also scored a success two months earlier when @entity192 agreed to drop similar labelling for its products			0
gendered toy signs have also been removed from major stores including @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 's , @entity200 and @entity201			0
speaking after @entity181 announced the changes , @entity203 , @entity204 , said : ' this is a particularly important victory for me			0
' it was heart - breaking shopping in @entity181 with my small daughter who chose toys from the " boys " section without realising			0

@entity11 furious after discovering store did n't sell female character
