it may be a @entity2 staple but the traditional fish and chips is in peril			1
as waters around the @entity2 get warmer , popular species of fish including haddock , plaice and lemon sole could become less common as they migrate to more preferable water temperatures			1
and this could see the prices of these fish soar , or see them being taken off the menu completely			2
researchers have developed a model that combined long - term fisheries data with climate model projections from the @entity22			1
from this they predicted the abundance and distribution of popular fish , such as haddock and plaice , could fall as the @entity29 warms and this could increase the price of fish and chips in the past 40 years , reports suggest the @entity29 has warmed four times faster than the global average			1
and with further warming predicted over the coming century , fisheries and scientists are studying the impact on so - called commercial species			2
this includes research by dr @entity44 , senior lecturer in marine biology and global change at the @entity47 and dr @entity48 , senior lecturer in fish ecology and evolution at the @entity51			0
the researchers developed a model that combined long - term fisheries data with climate model projections from the @entity22			1
from this they were able to predict the abundance and distribution of the @entity2 's fish over the next 50 years			0
as the @entity29 warms , species wo n't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare			1
as a result @entity2 fisheries will need to replace current species with those that prefer warmer water such as red mullet ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) , for example their research found that as the @entity29 warms , species wo n't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare			1
and due to higher temperatures , numbers of many of the species are predicted to fall			2
marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water			0
they warn that as the planet 's oceans grow more acidic , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising			0
climate change experts predict that over the next century , the acidity levels of the world 's oceans could drop from @entity94 to @entity95			0
many have warned this could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build the shells and skeletons they need to survive			0
' we will see a real changing of the guard in the next few decades , ' said dr @entity106			0
' our models predict cold water species will be squeezed out , with warmer water fish likely to take their place			2
' for sustainable @entity2 fisheries , we need to move on from haddock and chips and look to southern @entity114 for our gastronomic inspiration			2
' these fish include @entity118 dory and red mullet , for example			1
according to the study , fish distributions are limited by water temperature and some species can only thrive in certain habitats and depths			0
dr @entity48 , senior lecturer in @entity127 and @entity128 at the @entity51 , added : ' long - term standardised fisheries surveys from many @entity114 countries , alongside leading climate models for the region , mean it is a unique region to develop and test new modeling approaches			1
' ' the modeling technique used in this analysis performed remarkably well when tested on available long - term datasets			1
' this provides real confidence in the model 's ability to predict future patterns of fish distributions around the @entity2			0
the study was published in @entity145 .			0

researchers developed a model that combined long - term fisheries data with climate model projections from the @entity22
as the @entity29 warms the number of popular species is likely to fall
the prices of these staple fish could also rise as they become more rare
@entity69 and red mullet may replace haddock , plaice and lemon sole
