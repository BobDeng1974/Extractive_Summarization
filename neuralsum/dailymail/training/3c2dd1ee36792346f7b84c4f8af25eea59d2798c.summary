when she was the most famous hooker in showbusiness - thanks to career - defining roles in the 1986 film @entity3 and @entity5 's 90s tv hit @entity7 - @entity6 had a reputation for being a bit chippy			1
she 'd arrive late for interviews , answer questions dismissively and even turned @entity12 down after being told to lose weight			1
she 's just returned to the acting world after a four - year break in which she went to university to study literature and drama , and how she 's changed			1
@entity6 alongside @entity19 in @entity3 , she says @entity19 had a huge influence on her career @entity6 's now 48 and still has the perfectly sculpted cheekbones and feline eyes that made her one of @entity26 's most recognisable stars			1
only now her corkscrew @entity28 hair is tinged with grey and , i 'm relieved to see , she has a big smile on her face			1
she hooks her arm into mine as we search for somewhere to eat in the rundown south @entity38 suburb where she 's rehearsing for her latest play			1
she 's just thrown herself headlong into work ; after finishing critically acclaimed play @entity43 she 's about to start new show stand - a play about people standing up for what they believe in - in @entity49			1
but there 's a sad tinge when we meet , with the death from pneumonia of @entity19 , with whom she co-starred in @entity3			1
' he was the most genial of men , ' she recalls			1
' everyone loved working with him , and nobody had a bad word to say about him			1
he always gave advice freely and willingly , and with his help i became a better actress			1
' @entity3 was my first film and i was extremely nervous			1
@entity19 made me instantly feel at ease			1
he invited me around to dinner before we started shooting the movie and from the beginning he was a lovely , encouraging man			1
he always had a big wide smile on his face and you could talk to him about anything			1
he was the first male actor i saw cry and that encouraged me to show my own emotions more while acting			1
i learnt so much from him ; not only when it came to acting and how to be in front of cameras but even how to talk to the press			1
@entity6 starring in her recent play about black hairdressers - @entity83 ' we stayed in contact for a long time and i still have the postcard he sent me from @entity91 when @entity3 first came out there			1
it was a huge billboard of us from the film and he wrote , " look at us ! " i last saw him about three or four years ago when he 'd moved back to north @entity38			1
' we bumped into each other in the street and it was so nice to see him			1
he instantly invited me to a party at his house which i could n't go to because of work			1
i 'm still so sad and shocked that he died so young - to me 71 is young			1
i was sad i had n't seen more of him over the past few years but i know he had a happy life			1
he was surrounded by family and people who loved him and he had a great body of work			2
he was someone who made @entity26 proud			2
' @entity6 put her career - which had most recently included successful productions with the @entity114 and a spell in @entity116 - on hold after growing ' jaded ' with life			1
' i 'd lost my appetite for work , ' she says			2
' i did n't like the parts i was reading for			2
i 've always wanted to study but as an actor you 're always worried about missing that one big job			2
finally i just thought , " i 'm going to risk it			2
" ' ' i wanted to be white			2
there was this fantasy that if i was white i 'd have no problems			2
' so she rented out her house and took a student loan , moved into digs at @entity133 and buried her head in her books			2
' i 'm delighted i did it because it 's changed everything , ' she beams			2
' it 's given me a confidence i never had before			2
i was so miserable in my own life			2
i did n't live outside of work			2
i did n't have a social life , or the social skills to meet people			2
it 's shown me new things are n't just for the young			2
the only problem was , when i finished university i worried i was too content to act			2
i always did my best work when i was miserable			0
but i suppose there 's always something to worry about , ' she laughs			0
@entity6 's always been a worrier			1
the only child of a @entity157 barrister father who was largely absent during her childhood and a @entity26 social worker mother , she never had much time for school apart from drama lessons			0
she 'd regularly play truant and when she was 13 ran away from home , finding a job as a chambermaid in @entity38 for a week before she was tracked down by the police and sent home			0
' i was a bit of a rebel and i found @entity170 totally uninspiring , ' she says			0
' i knew i did n't want to stay there			0
we lived in a block of flats which was mainly filled with single mothers			0
many of them were nice but there were lots of things that made me frightened to walk out the door			0
the whole area was racist and there was a lot of joyriding and mugging			0
' being told ' go back to where you come from ' was normal and she still recalls being told that if she rubbed her skin enough it would turn white			0
' i wanted to be white			0
there was this fantasy that if i was white i 'd have no problems			0
' @entity6 's most famous role was a prostitute in @entity7 , however she said this was the most miserable period of her life for @entity6 acting was a release , a way of coping with her emotions , and a way out of @entity170			1
after a spell at @entity170 's @entity205 - where the likes of @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 began their careers - she joined the @entity114			1
by then she 'd already met and married @entity212 actor @entity211 ( now mini-cab driver @entity213 in @entity214 ) after she saw him perform in @entity170			0
' he was one of the first men i really had a conversation with ; he could speak , ' she says			0
within a month of being together she proposed			0
' i was a feminist and he said yes			0
it was crazy , i did n't even know who i was , let alone who he was			0
' they married in 1984 when she was 19 and he was 20			0
two years later she was thrust into the limelight with the success of @entity3 , in which she played a high - class prostitute with @entity19 as her ex-con driver			1
@entity12 came calling but she was terrified when hints were dropped by agents that she needed to lose weight			0
' i was frightened when people told me to lose weight			0
i thought , " i want people to judge what 's coming out of my mouth rather than what i look like			0
i 've got a brain			0
" ' ' i turned down several auditions which was silly but i was frightened when people told me to lose weight because i was already skinny			0
i thought , " i want people to judge what 's coming out of my mouth rather than what i look like			0
i 've got a brain			0
" ' her career was temporarily stalled by the birth of her son @entity251 in 1988			0
but by then her marriage was crumbling and they divorced when @entity251 was still a baby			0
@entity6 's reluctant to talk about @entity211 's well - publicised drug problems but says the pair finally have ' a respectful relationship ' because of their musician son			1
she 's never married again ; nor had a serious relationship			1
' i suppose i need to be stimulated to stay with the same person			0
' in 1995 she took on her other most famous role ; as another prostitute in @entity7			0
despite its success she says it was one of the most miserable periods of her life			0
' i was still finding my feet and angry , ' she says			0
' my marriage had disintegrated and i felt shame			0
i do n't think i was clinically depressed but i was very troubled			0
' many older actresses insist they 're happier to have left their nubile 20s behind , but i 've never believed any of them as much as i believe @entity6			1
' i 'm so grateful to be older and be in the space i am now , ' she says			1
' if only i knew back then what i know now			0
' @entity6 will be appearing in @entity277 at the @entity278 , from 29 may			1

@entity6 *discusses* how the late @entity19 inspired her acting
she describes her love - hate relationship with the acting world
@entity6 claims she is much happier now that she is older
