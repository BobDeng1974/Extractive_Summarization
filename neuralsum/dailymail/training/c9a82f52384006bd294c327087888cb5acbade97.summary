@entity1 's policy on university tuition fees is in chaos after a plan by @entity5 to slash fees to £ 6,000 a year blew up in his face			1
the party leader had sought to curry favour with students by announcing that a @entity1 government would reduce the maximum annual cost of £ 9,000 by a third			1
but he refused yesterday to say if the plan would be in @entity1 ’s next election manifesto and his higher education spokesman @entity15 announced that a graduate tax was still only a ‘ long - term aspiration ’			1
pledge : labour leader @entity5 said his party would slash university tuition fees by £ 3000 mr @entity5 made the eye - catching pledge at the start of a difficult party conference at which his leadership is under scrutiny and polls suggest he is deeply unpopular			1
he was immediately accused of a cynical u-turn , reversing his previous opposition to any tuition fees which cost more than the current £ 3,000 a year			0
the new policy would be paid for by forcing graduates earning more than £ 65,000 a year to pay a higher rate of interest on their student loans and by axing the government ’s proposed corporation tax cut for the banks			0
the announcement was designed to court @entity41 voters and hard - up students who felt betrayed by @entity44 ’s decision to back a tripling of fees from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year			0
meet and greet : @entity5 arrives at @entity47 for the annual @entity48 but the plan was summarily rejected by the @entity50 as of no benefit to the poor , since only graduates earning more than £ 35,000 would benefit			1
in an interview with two sunday newspapers mr @entity5 said he wanted to make it easier for people to go to university and not feel burdened by debt			2
' parents up and down the country are incredibly worried about their sons and daughters , ' he told the @entity64			0
under the plans , graduates earning more than £ 65,000 a year would pay higher interest on their student loans to help fund the lower cap			0
the rest would be found by cancelling the government 's cut in corporation tax for banks			0
mr @entity5 told the conference he would tax bankers and top - earning graduates to fund the cut , which would cost the public purse £ 1billion mr @entity5 told @entity80 that @entity81 and @entity44 risked destroying the ambition of a generation by ' loading the costs of paying off the deficit onto our young people '			1
ditching the government 's proposed cut in corporation tax from 28 per cent to 23 per cent was ' fair ' because ' we should n't be cutting taxes for the banks at the moment ' , he said			0
but according to coalition sources the corporation tax cut for banks was already offset by the bank levy and suggested better - off graduates would find ways to get around the higher rates			0
universities minister @entity102 said @entity1 's proposals represented a cynical u-turn			2
' @entity5 promised a graduate tax and now he 's accepting fees have to increase to finance universities in tough times , ' he said			2
@entity109 said the previous @entity1 government lost the confidence of voters because it was addicted to the ' crack cocaine ' of courting the media ' so why should students trust anything he says ? he says one thing to become leader and within a year does a u-turn			1
' it makes @entity1 's vote last year against fee increases look completely cynical			2
' ministers initially claimed that fees over £ 6,000 would be the exception but official figures show more than a third of @entity129 universities have been granted permission to charge fees of £ 9,000 from 2012			0
students starting degree courses from next year face average tuition fees of almost £ 8,500			0
mr @entity5 also told the @entity135 this morning that the coalition 's austerity measures were ' not working ' and he urged the government to change course			1
he accused the coalition of failing to meet their deficit reduction plans and called for a temporary cut in @entity143 to help boost the economy			0
mr @entity5 told the @entity145 : ' i think we 've seen a big change over the last year , which is a year ago there was a contested argument about whether the government strategy should work			1
" it 's not working , it 's not working for @entity153 because unemployment is going up , and it 's not working even to cut the deficit because unless you grow the economy you ca n't cut your deficit			0
' in an interview with the @entity160 on sunday shadow olympics minister @entity109 said the previous @entity1 government lost the confidence of voters because it was addicted to the ' crack cocaine ' of courting the media rather than listening to the public			1
she said that @entity1 should have taken a harder line with @entity169 's @entity168 following allegations of phone hacking when her party was in power			2
ms @entity109 said : ' what we 've got to accept is that in the country more widely , nobody is listening			2
the biggest battle that @entity1 has at the moment is to be relevant and to be heard ... for so many people , it 's just white noise			2
' i think that the mistake that we made - it 's a bit like the crack cocaine of politics , is n't it ? getting a good write - up , or the horror of a bad write - up			1
' but former deputy prime minister @entity195 took a pop at ms @entity109 's comments on @entity198			2
so @entity1 was addicted to @entity169 like ' crack cocaine , ' he tweeted and added , ' you spent @entity202 with @entity203 ! any more @entity168 dos ? ' stance : mr @entity5 claims the coalition 's austerity measures are ' not working ' and he urged the government to change course @entity210 said the party will back public sector strikes if the government remains ' unreasonable ' in talks with trade unions over efforts to secure agreement over pension reforms			1
@entity5 urged the government to engage in ' serious ' negotiations but refused to say whether he would support industrial action			1
he urged ministers not to act as if they were ' spoiling for a fight ' with the unions amid anger over proposed changes to public sector pensions			1
@entity5 spoke out against a strike by teachers and civil servants in june and would not be drawn on if he would support a fresh wave of action , telling @entity233 's @entity145 : ' i 'm not interested in ifs			2
' but he added : ' strikes are a sign of failure , we 've got to avoid them and there is a big responsibility on @entity213 to stop them happening			1
' @entity244 , general secretary of the @entity245 , one of several unions planning to ballot workers for strikes later this year , said the government was attacking the retirement incomes and pension rights of millions of workers over its controversial plans to increase contributions by 3.2 per cent			0
frankly , if the @entity48 can not stand up and support people defending themselves and their families , then what does it stand for ? ' mr @entity5 also announced that he would be championing a package of internal reforms already approved by the @entity48 's ruling @entity261			0
the changes , which party members will be voting on at the upcoming conference , include giving non-member ' registered voters ' the right to have a say in party leadership elections if they reach 50,000 in number			0
the @entity261 has also agreed to review conference voting arrangements and the weight given to union votes			0
@entity5 arrives at the @entity48 with his wife @entity273 and their sons @entity275 and @entity276 mr @entity5 said : ' i want to change our party to make us more outward - looking , so we spend our time talking to the public and not ourselves			1
' in his keynote speech on tuesday mr @entity5 will outline proposals to force energy firms to pool electricity they produce to encourage smaller firms to join the market and force down spiralling fuel bills			0
several senior @entity1 politicians , including former cabinet members @entity291 and @entity195 and shadow health minister @entity293 have signed a letter in @entity80 today urging the leadership to back the @entity297 campaign which would encourage more people from working class backgrounds to become party candidates			1
' if the @entity48 is to continue to be the true people 's party into the 21st century and wishes to win back the five million predominantly working class voters it 's lost since 1997 , then it has to reflect those who it wishes to represent , ' they said in the letter .			0

leader @entity5 says the government risks ' destroying the ambition of a generation '
he says austerity measures are not working and urges government to change course
@entity1 to back public sector strikes if @entity213 remains ' unreasonable '
@entity109 says @entity1 was addicted to ' crack cocaine ' of courting media
