by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 1 august 2013 with summer in full swing , celebrities and the @entity4 public alike are baring more flesh as the temperature climbs			0
hot pants are getting shorter and crop tops more skimpy as we dress to beat the heat			0
@entity11 and @entity12 may rock the look , but showing off your ' underbutt ' - showing off too much buttock in a pair of tiny shorts - does n't find favour with everyone			1
the underbutt may be this summer 's biggest trend , but it 's also just been voted one of the season 's biggest fashion disasters in a new poll			2
a quarter of women aged 18 - 24 questioned admit to having shown a bit too much underbutt at one time or another , and now describe it as a ' faux pas			2
' cheeky : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) love to show off a bit of underbutt - but now the look has been voted one of the biggest fashion disasters of the summer also included in the top ten summer style crimes were visible panty lines , muffin tops and too much cleavage			1
and , while @entity45 may be one of the fashion capitals of the world , its experimental nature leads locals to commit more fashion felonies than any other region			0
but , as @entity52 , chief executive and co-founder at virtual fitting room provider @entity54 , who carried out the survey , points out : ' @entity58 is not responsible for fashion faux pas : the problem is that we all - too - frequently choose clothes that do n’t fit our body size or shape			1
' three - quarters of all the fashion mistakes that women make are actually related to how well their clothes fit , and two - thirds of men ’s mistakes too			2
' of the women polled , 84 per cent admit to having committed a serious fashion faux pas			1
and men are just as guilty : a quarter of men under - 35 have yanked their trousers too high , the outfit offence made infamous by @entity77			2
style crimes : @entity79 shows us her underbutt ( left ) , which featured in the top five most hated looks - muffin tops ( right ) were also loathed by the public @entity4 abroad are well - known for their taste transgressions , and it seems summer brings out the exhibitionist in us : one in 10 women have worn bikinis that are too small , while a third admit to wearing skirts that are too short			1
one in five 35 - 55 year old men admit to channeling their inner @entity92 by wearing tiny swimming trunks			0
@entity52 thinks there could be a simple explanation for all this : ' 36 per cent of shoppers recently told us that they use in - store fitting rooms less than they did just three years ago			0
' male mistakes : a quarter of men have admitted to wearing their trousers too high like @entity77 ( left ) and one in five love tiny speedos like @entity92 ( right ) - both voted top fashion crimes ' we ’re also a self - conscious nation , with 18 per cent of consumers saying they dislike leaving their cubicle in order to see themselves in a public , full - length mirror			1
' and we are buying more clothes online where it ’s often not even possible to " try before you buy "			0
' perhaps retailers need to put more effort , online and offline , into making the trying - on of clothes a pleasurable part of the shopping experience again ? ' hmm			0
are we too shy and retiring to look in the mirror at home , too ? or maybe the flesh - flashing girls and the boys bursting out of their budgie smugglers know exactly what they look like - and do n't really care what anyone else thinks			0
muffin tops @entity135 that do n’t cover your bum too much cleavage on show socks with sandals @entity142 worn too high low - slung trousers , showing underwear @entity145 - smugglers			1

visible panty line topped this season 's fashion faux pas list
muffin tops , too - high trousers and underbutt also make top ten
@entity11 , @entity157 and @entity12 love high - cut shorts
@entity160 commit the most style crimes
