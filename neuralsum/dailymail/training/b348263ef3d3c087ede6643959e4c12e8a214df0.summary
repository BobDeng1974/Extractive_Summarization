by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 06:12 est , 23 may 2013 from @entity3 's meat dress to necklaces made from pheasant 's skulls , some designers use all sorts of weird and wonderful materials to create ' carcass couture '			1
and one @entity11 design student is following suit by creating a handbag line from tripe in honour of one of @entity11 ’s most iconic creatures			2
@entity18 , 23 , has crafted the unique and somehow luxurious collection of bags using the stomach lining of a @entity22 – after realising how much of the animal goes to waste once it is slaughtered			1
unique : @entity18 crafted the collection using the stomach lining of a @entity22 - after realising how much of the animal goes to waste once it is slaughtered @entity18 , a 4th year studying at @entity29 , said : ' 40 per cent of the animal is edible but a lot of the " off - cuts " , like tripe are used for dog - food			1
' a lot of abattoirs also sell the hides on to customers in @entity39 and i just thought , this is our national animal , why are n’t we more proud of it ? ! ' her four statement bags , which will go on display at the @entity29 ’s @entity46 from 24th may , were all hand stitched			1
the collection ranges from a formal clutch to a dainty handbag , with tripe either used as a lining or outer material			1
creative : the budding designer hopes her creations go some way to make people think differently about animals the fastenings are also made using the animal ’s horns and bull - ring			2
' my lecturer kept saying they would look great on @entity3 ' , said @entity18			1
' it was really hard to get hold of tanned tripe so i attempted the tanning process myself in my bath			2
i had to leave the tripe soaking there for about a week before hanging it to dry on my clothes rack			0
my friends thought i was mad			0
' the talented student also hit a further hiccup along the way when her flat was raided by wildlife officers			0
' my letting agent had been carrying out an inspection in my flat and had obviously come across a pair of cow horns ' , @entity18 said			1
' but he had thought they were ivory tusks and called the police ! i was terrified , but they just laughed when they saw the horns			0
' problematic : the talented student hit a hiccup along the way when her flat was raided by wildlife officers because her landlord found horns in her room the budding designer hopes her creations go some way to make people think differently about animals			0
' if each butcher was given one cow , one pig and one sheep to feed his local community every part of the animals would be used , but in this day and age of mass - farming that just does n’t happen			0
' i wanted to show more respect for this stunning animal by using its less palatable pieces to create something beautiful and unique			2
' on display : her four statement bags will go on display at the @entity29 's @entity46 from 24th may famous fan ? @entity18 's tutor says they would look great on @entity3 , who is know for her quirky fashion sense @entity122 , @entity123 : @entity124 , said : ' @entity18 ’s designs are thought provoking and like much of the work set to go on show , executed to a high standard			1
