it was a vast boat that saved two of each animal and a handful of humans from a catastrophic flood			0
but a controlversial new theory claims that in fact , @entity7 was round - and made of reeds			1
a leading academic claims a recently deciphered 4,000 - year - old tablet from ancient @entity12 ( modern - day @entity13 ) reveals the striking new details about the roots of the @entity18 tale of @entity7			1
@entity19 , curator in charge of cuneiform clay tablets at the @entity22 , poses with the 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the @entity7 and the flood , that claims the @entity7 was actually round the text describes god speaking to @entity28 , a @entity30 king who is the @entity7 figure in earlier versions of the ark story			1
he says : ' @entity34 , wall ! @entity36 wall , reed wall ! @entity39 - @entity38 , pay heed to my advice , that you may live forever ! destroy your house , build a boat ; despise possessions and save life ! draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design ; let its length and breadth be the same			2
' the ancient @entity54 text describes the ark as a round 220 - ft diameter coracle with walls 20 - ft high			1
according to the tablet , the ark had two levels and a roof on the top			2
the craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections			0
the 60 lines of text , which dr @entity19 describes as a ' detailed construction manual for building an ark ' , claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof			1
it tells a similar story , complete with detailed instructions for building a giant round vessel known as a coracle — as well as the key instruction that animals should enter ' two by two			1
' the tablet went on display at the @entity22 today , and soon engineers will follow the ancient instructions to see whether the vessel could actually have sailed			2
it 's also the subject of a new book , " @entity94 , " by @entity19 , the museum 's assistant keeper of the @entity91 and the man who translated the tablet			1
@entity19 got hold of it a few years ago , when a man brought in a damaged tablet his father had acquired in the @entity91 after @entity100 it was light brown , about the size of a mobile phone and covered in the jagged cuneiform script of the ancient @entity106			1
' it was really a heart - stopping moment — the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat , ' said @entity19 , who sports a long gray beard , a ponytail and boundless enthusiasm for his subject			2
' that was a real surprise			0
' new revelation : according to an ancient @entity54 tablet , @entity7 was a 220 - ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six @entity123 buses - with walls 20 - ft high @entity19 believes a round boat makes sense			1
coracles were widely used as river taxis in ancient @entity13 and are perfectly designed to bob along on raging floodwaters			0
' it 's a perfect thing , ' @entity19 said			0
' it never sinks , it 's light to carry			0
' @entity134 , an expert on the antiquities of ancient @entity12 at @entity137 's @entity136 , said it made sense that ancient @entity106 would depict their mythological ark in that shape			2
the tablet records a @entity12 god 's instructions for building a giant vessel , two - thirds the size of a soccer field in area , made of rope , reinforced with wooden ribs and coated in bitumen			1
@entity19 said that on paper ( or stone ) the boat - building orders appear sound , but he does n't yet know whether it would have floated			2
a television documentary due to be broadcast later this year will follow attempts to build the ark according to the ancient manual			2
the 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the @entity7 and the flood stands on display at the @entity22 in @entity123 the artefact was discovered in the @entity91 by @entity166 , who indulged his passion for history while serving in the @entity169 from 1945 to 1948			1
the relic was passed to his son @entity171 , who took it to dr @entity19 to translate			1
the tablet went on display at the @entity22 today , and soon engineers will follow the ancient instructions to see whether the vessel could actually have sailed the flood story recurs in later @entity12 writings including the ' @entity180			1
' these versions lack the technical instructions — cut out , @entity19 believes , because they got in the way of the storytelling			2
' it would be like a @entity187 movie where instead of having this great sexy red car that comes on , somebody starts to tell you about how many horsepower it 's got and the pressure of the tires and the capacity of the boot ( trunk ) , ' he said			0
' no one cares about that			0
they want the car chase			0
' ' already in 1872 people were writing about it in a worried way — what does it mean that @entity210 appears on this piece of @entity212 ? " he joked , referring to a cereal similar in shape to the tablet			0
@entity19 said he has no doubts			0
@entity19 , curator in charge of cuneiform clay tablets at the @entity22 , poses with the 4000 year old clay tablet containing the story of the @entity7 and the flood			1
' i 'm sure the story of the flood and a boat to rescue life is a @entity54 invention , ' he said			0
he believes the tale was likely passed on to the @entity226 during their exile in @entity228 in the 6th century @entity229 and he does n't think the tablet provides evidence the ark described in the @entity233 existed			0
he said it 's more likely that a devastating real flood made its way into folk memory , and has remained there ever since			0
' the idea that floods are caused by sin is happily still alive among us , ' he added , pointing out a local councilor in @entity244 who made headlines recently for saying @entity247 's recent storms were caused by the legalization of gay marriage			0
' had i known it , it would have gone in the preface of the book , ' @entity19 said			0
@entity7 is typically portrayed at a traditional ship , such as in this @entity257 mid- 16th century painting			1

dr @entity19 has translated cuneiform text on an *3,700* - old clay tablet
the ancient script details the @entity12 story of @entity7
the text also contains instructions on how to build an ark to escape a flood
but its describes the craft as being a round 220 - ft diameter coracle
the design is very different to the *popular* imagining of a traditional ship
