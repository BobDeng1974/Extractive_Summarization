the mother of a two - year - old girl who died in agony in hospital after a series of delays said she felt ' let down by the system ' - as a medical expert said her daughter ’s death was ' avoidable '			1
tragic toddler @entity10 died after developing hydrocephalus - water on the brain - which caused irreversible brain damage			1
an inquest heard that @entity16 ’s care was blighted by a series of shocking delays and failures at the three @entity21 hospitals that shared her care - the @entity20 in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 ’s in @entity27			1
@entity10 , two , died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an mri scan			1
she had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour today @entity16 ’s mother , @entity33 , said she had serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on			1
in part of her statement , read to @entity39 , she said : ' i felt completely let down by the system			0
' no child should have to experience what she suffered in the final weeks of her life			0
' taking to the witness stand to give evidence in person , mrs @entity10 added : ' i ’m still not convinced that shared care is a safe option for providing care for very sick children			1
' i ’m afraid our experience of even trying to find the truth about our daughter has been hugely complicated			0
' we have found that going through the reports they have written in response to our questions has been very lengthy , we have not agreed with many of the things they have written			0
' it is saddening that this situation is still in place			0
' flawed system : the two - year - old 's parents @entity33 and @entity67 , say they have serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on @entity16 had undergone an operation to remove a brain tumour in january 2011 and had been responding well to chemotherapy , the inquest heard			1
but her condition deteriorated and her worried parents took her to the @entity20 on march 23rd complaining that she was unsteady and vomiting			1
she was discharged that night but continued being sick so her parents rushed her to @entity79 where they told doctors that specialists had said @entity16 should have an emergency ct scan , the inquest heard			2
but @entity84 and mrs @entity10 claim their pleas fell on deaf ears as doctors refused the scan , and said the sick toddler did not ' fit their criteria '			1
mrs @entity10 said that by march 25th she was ' becoming so frustrated that the situation with our daughter was becoming more serious and that we were n’t being listened to			2
' @entity16 had undergone an operation to remove a brain tumour in january 2011 and had been responding well to chemotherapy , the inquest heard she rang doctors at the @entity20 and pleaded with them to speed up the process so the ct scan would be done sooner			1
she added : ' it seemed to us that no action was being taken			0
' by that night @entity16 ’s condition had deteriorated and she was vomiting more			2
mrs @entity10 , who kept vigil by her daughter ’s bed every night , said : ' i reported the vomiting to the nursing team and i took a note on my mobile phone because i was n’t convinced they were keeping all the records with the vomiting			1
' it was not until march 26th - some three days after @entity16 was first admitted - that the scan was ordered and by this point the brain damage was irreversible			2
in a scathing indictment of the care @entity16 received , an expert doctor said that @entity79 was guilty of a ' basic failure in care '			2
dr @entity126 , consultant paediatrician at @entity127 , said in his report : ' it is unclear to me why a ct scan was not undertaken on the face of clear evidence on march 24 and 25			0
' had a ct scan been undertaken it would have shown hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure			0
' he told the inquest that by 6.30pm on march 25 @entity16 ’s vomiting had worsened and that the ' threshold ' for a ct scan had been crossed			2
he was asked by the family ’s barrister @entity142 if the hospital ’s failure to tell a consultant about her worsening condition amounted to ' a basic failure '			0
he replied ' i would say so			0
' he added : ' there is a basic failure to respond and comply with a plan that has been set and order an urgent ct scan			0
' an inquest heard staff at @entity79 in south @entity21 failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the @entity20 in @entity24 , to give @entity16 a ct scan if her condition worsened he said that if a ct scan had been ordered it would have diagnosed hydrocephalus and @entity16 would have been rushed to @entity164 for an operation			1
asked by mr @entity142 if the ' death was avoidable ' he said ' that is my opinion '			0
he also criticised doctors who dismissed the concerns of @entity16 ’s parents saying a doctor would be ' foolhardy to dismiss the suggestions by the parents that there had been a deterioration '			2
he also raised questions about the operation of shared care systems , which he said were not robust and relied on phonecalls between individual doctors rather than shared protocals			1
after the scan @entity16 was rushed to @entity186 where specialist neurological surgeons operated to ease the pressure on her brain			0
but she died just days later , on march 30th .			0
