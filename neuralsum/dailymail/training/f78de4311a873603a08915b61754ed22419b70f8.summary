@entity0 has been criticised for the ‘ amazing ’ omission of immigration from the top six issues on which the @entity4 will fight the forthcoming election			1
neither @entity7 ’s borders nor the health service merited a mention in his party ’s pitch to voters in may , which includes cutting the deficit , jobs , tax , education , housing and retirement			1
this is despite polls consistently showing these are the two issues of greatest concern to voters , often eclipsing economic growth			1
@entity0 was criticised yesterday after omitting immigration and health care from the top six issues on which the @entity4 will fight the forthcoming election mr @entity0 , who was addressing an audience party member in @entity28 yesterday , claimed it was not an oversight but would be addressed as part his offer on jobs and the economy			1
in a long - awaited immigration speech last november , mr @entity0 announced that migrants would have to work in the @entity7 for four years before being eligible for state benefits – up from three months – under a future @entity4 government			1
yesterday the prime minister said immigration was part of his pitch that @entity7 ‘ should live within her means ’ and that the public could expect more detailed plans in the coming months			1
‘ these areas i am talking about are very directly related to people ’s concerns about their lives and their security ’ , he said when asked about leaving it out			0
‘ it ’s about people ’s jobs , people ’s taxes , the homes they want to buy , the schools they want to send their children to , and their retirement			2
through this prism we will address every single issue			0
’ he said he had already set out ‘ the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country ’ to tackle @entity71 immigration through curbs on access to benefits			2
immigration is one of the areas in which the prime minister plans to push for further reforms as part of his renegotiation of @entity7 ’s membership of the @entity83 , if he wins a second term			1
it is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the @entity83 will be blocked by @entity90 chancellor @entity89 ( pictured here ) and others but his party are under pressure for failing to deliver on their pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands , with the latest figures showing it had leapt to 260,000			2
and it is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the @entity83 will be blocked by @entity90 chancellor @entity89 and others			0
in his pre-election speech about jobs - in which he may elaborate on @entity107 ’s pledge to create full employment - he will lay out ‘ exactly how we will deal with this issue of immigration ’ , he said			2
however lord green of @entity113 , the head of the think tank @entity115 said the omission of it from his priorities was ‘ amazing ’			0
for workers from the @entity83 : no in - work benefits until they have been in @entity7 for four years no social housing for four years no child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the @entity7 for unemployed @entity83 migrants : no support from the @entity7 taxpayer deportation if they do not get a job for six months other measures include : impose restrictions on @entity83 migrants bringing in family members from outside the @entity83 @entity136 bans on rough sleepers , beggars and fraudsters returning to the @entity7 tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity83 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity7 levels he said yesterday : ‘ immigration has now come top equal with the economy the past six months among the issues the public are most concerned with			1
' it is amazing that the @entity4 have not included it in their top six issues for the election campaign			2
’ mr @entity0 also insisted that the @entity158 was ‘ at the heart of this commitment for @entity7 to live within her means ’			1
@entity163 seized on its absence from the list yesterday saying it was the subject that ‘ dare not speak its ’ name ’			0
the prime minister said his party had protected the @entity158 budget , while making cuts elsewhere , over the last five years and would make the same commitment for the next @entity174			0
‘ not a penny will be cut from the @entity158 budget - instead it will carry on rising , ’ he said			0
‘ i am a father , a son and a husband who has relied on the @entity158 many times			0
‘ when you are sick , when your loved ones are ill , when you feel at your most vulnerable , you need to know the @entity158 is there			0
that is why we are making this commitment			0
‘ that is the right thing to do for the sick , the frail and the vulnerable in our country			0
and the right thing for the @entity158 long - term is to get @entity7 back to living within its means			1
’ last night a @entity193 poll for @entity194 put ‘ managing the @entity158 ’ as voters top concern – overtaking ‘ controlling immigration ’ for the first time in six months			1
half of @entity7 people now list the health service as one of their top three priorities , compared with only 39 per cent last months			1
immigration is a top three concern for 46pc of voters			2
third on the list , chosen by 25 per cent of people , was ‘ keeping down the cost of everyday items , such as food , energy and travel ’ and fourth was ‘ promoting economic growth			0

@entity0 also left out health care from his party *'s* pitch to voters in may
despite polls showing the two issues are of greatest concern to voters
did include cutting the deficit , jobs , tax , education , housing and retirement
*pm* claims was *n't* oversight and will be addressed as part of economy offer
@entity239 immigration was part of pitch @entity7 ' should live within her means '
