@entity1 's team won 5 - 3 on this day four years ago as well , but the circumstances could hardly be more contrasting			1
he was playing for @entity8 at the time in the @entity9 , the seventh tier of @entity6 football , and that night 658 hardy souls saw the @entity10 beat @entity1 's former club , @entity11			1
their @entity17 ground , with its weather - worn stands and grass bank behind one goal , is a million miles away from where @entity1 is now , putting @entity19 to the sword in one of the most remarkable results in the @entity9 era			1
@entity1 played a role in all five of @entity26 's goals as they put @entity19 to the sword @entity29 ( foreground ) and @entity31 reflect as the goals roll in for @entity26 @entity33 conceded a penalty and received a red card for this foul on @entity1 @entity33 ca n't quite believe he 's been sent off as @entity26 piled on the misery at the @entity38 forget @entity39 and @entity40 , this was the @entity1 show as he ran @entity19 's atrocious defence ragged , exposing the fundamental flaw in @entity45 's thrill - a - minute football masterplan			1
@entity1 was irrepressible , playing a role in all five of @entity26 's goals			1
he crossed for @entity48 to head home the first and was fouled by @entity51 to win a penalty for the second			2
he inadvertently blocked a shot to tee up @entity55 for their third , then broke clear to calmly roll home the fourth			0
finally , all for good measure , he bamboozled @entity33 to win a penalty for the fifth , the foul prompting referee @entity59 to send off the youngster			2
it was the final indignity on an afternoon in which @entity19 simply imploded			0
so it was @entity1 , a man who was playing non-league football as recently as may 2012 , who ruthlessly exposed @entity19 's glaring defensive failings			1
proof , as if it were needed , that you should always expect the glorious unexpected in football			0
@entity1 is bundled over by @entity51 , leading to a penalty and @entity26 's second goal @entity75 limped off injured , adding to @entity19 's crisis at the back @entity45 and @entity78 ( left ) look miserable on the bench as the result gets worse @entity19 's attacking football was magnificent - @entity88 was mesmerising , @entity40 dangerous , @entity86 clinical - but they spent the second half at sixes and sevens in defence			1
in the end , those numbers could well have been @entity26 's goal tally , perhaps even more			1
@entity19 were n't helped by @entity59 's incorrect decision not to penalise @entity1 for barging @entity51 over in the lead - up to the first penalty , nor earlier on when @entity75 , arguably the one member of the back line who looks competent , succumbed to injury on the half - hour			1
he was replaced by @entity29 , himself returning from an injury lay - off			0
but most of @entity26 's other profitable moments going forward were the result of a defensive horror show			1
@entity45 spent £ 16m on @entity31 and will be alarmed at how susceptible he looked			1
@entity1 tied the @entity104 in knots , notably when he skinned him to cross for @entity48 to get @entity26 back in the game at 1 - 2			1
it also his poor pass in the 79th minute that enabled @entity109 , a @entity19 reject , to mug @entity110 and play @entity1 through for the fourth goal			2
@entity75 returned to watch the second half from the bench , wearing a protective boot @entity29 struggles to get a grip of @entity1 during the second - half @entity31 is meant to be more comfortable at left - back than in the middle but that was n't apparent here			1
he looked totally stunned by the pace of @entity9 football , an accident waiting to happen			0
@entity33 is just 20 and has much to learn and with @entity19 's defensive injury problems continuing , he 'll have to educate himself quickly			1
first though , he 'll have to serve a suspension			0
he made one excellent last - ditch tackle to thwart @entity1 when clean through but was reckless in bringing down the striker to concede a penalty and earn himself a red card			2
@entity33 is still meek , he has n't yet developed the command and authority needed to operate at centre - half and would have benefitted greatly from a few games alongside @entity132 or @entity133			1
@entity19 were hasty in letting them go			0
the years of experience they could bring to the back line is painfully missing			2
@entity75 , who sat on the bench in a protective leg brace and left the @entity38 on crutches , is the closest @entity19 now have			2
it looks like he 'll be absent for quite a few weeks			0
@entity140 shouts at his defence as another @entity26 goal goes in @entity140 ( left ) , @entity33 ( centre ) and @entity144 after @entity26 went into the lead at 4 - 3 @entity19 could have done with the authority and experience of @entity133 , who went to @entity148 over the summer they play @entity149 next weekend but have tougher assignments against @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 on the horizon			1
the title contenders would have watched @entity1 's performance with glee			2
if a newly - promoted team can rip @entity19 open at will , then they 'll have a field day			2
@entity51 , equally , looks a liability			0
he was out of position when @entity48 headed in and allowed himself to be pushed over by @entity1 when trying to usher the ball out			0
his resultant foul on the @entity26 man inside the box was beyond stupidity with @entity33 covering			2
@entity144 and @entity170 were exclusively concerned with pushing forward , they felt it was n't their business to track back and provide cover			0
as a result , the space @entity26 were able to exploit on the counter-attack was astonishing			0
this would never have happened under sir @entity178 and probably not even under @entity179			0
this result has ruthlessly highlighted the flaw in @entity45 's summer transfer policy			1
@entity182 looks astonished as @entity48 heads the ball past him for @entity26 's first goal @entity19 were linked with @entity186 defender @entity185 over the summer overloading the team with some of the world 's best attacking talent is all well and good but defensively , @entity19 are still short of two world class defenders			1
they are imbalanced and how it showed			0
@entity192 has yet to figure and @entity31 yet to impress			0
it certainly would have been handy to have a @entity185 or @entity194 figure ready to step in but @entity19 went for style over substance			0
captain @entity140 spent much of the second half screaming at his defence			0
the fury and frustration in his eyes and voice clear for everyone to see			0
it could become a familiar sight this season at this rate .			0

@entity1 had a hand in all five goals as @entity26 came from 3 - 1 down to beat @entity19 5 - 3
he exposed a *lacklustre* @entity19 back line who looked out of their depth
@entity75 was forced off through injury in the first half
£ 16m signing @entity31 struggled to contain @entity26 's forward line
@entity33 lacked authority and was sent off for fouling @entity1
@entity51 also conceded a *controversial* penalty for fouling @entity1
the result exposed the imbalance in @entity45 's team
@entity19 could have done with another world class defender or two but @entity45 decided to sign mostly stylish attacking players
