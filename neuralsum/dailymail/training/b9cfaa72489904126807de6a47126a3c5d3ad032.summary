by @entity1 reporter published : 18:02 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 17 august 2012 a ginormous 400 - foot deep sinkhole in @entity3 is expanding and today swallowed a boat			1
two clean - up workers who were in the boat had to be rescued before they too disappeared into the watery mass , which today grew by another 50ft , authorities said			1
the vessel was tied to a tree on the south west side of the site as the workers cleaned up diesel in the sinkhole			1
the workers were rescued by air boat and did not suffer any injuries but all clean up operations at the site have now been suspended until further notice due to concerns over safety			1
' early this morning they started the clean up operation of the diesel , ' said @entity42 , director of @entity43 for @entity44			2
' two of the workers were in a small @entity42 's boat and had a rope skimmer			1
the boat was tied to trees but that edge slouched and basically the boat started to go in with it			2
there was an air boat nearby and they were rescued as the trees went in and took the boat in too			1
' the gaping hole now measures about 526 - feet from northeast to southwest and 640 - feet from northwest to southeast			1
sunken : a boat similar to the one pictured disappeared into the growing sinkhole this morning but its two crew were rescued governor 's @entity64 spokesman @entity63 said scientists who looked at the site had anticipated the sinkhole to grow and believe its maximum size would get to 1400 - ft across			1
' we have n't got there yet but even at that size it would not be a threat to any homes , ' she said			2
officials still fear possible explosions from nearby gas - filled caverns			2
last week , the massive sinkhole in the @entity3 bayou swallowed all of the 100 - foot trees in the surrounding area and led to mandatory evacuations			1
about 150 people were ordered to leave their residences after the gaping hole opened in @entity44 amid fears of potential radiation leaks and natural gas explosions			1
growing : the boat was tied to a tree on the southwest side of the site , pictured today but despite the authorities enacting the mandatory evacuation , most people chose to stay following allegations of a cover - up and industrial mismanagement from the owners of a nearby salt cavern			1
as state scientists monitored the toxicity of naturally occurring radiation at a slurry hole in @entity44 , residents said last thursday they were furious with their public state officials because they think they have been withholding information			1
the @entity110 said the slurry hole near @entity112 is near areas that have been used for oil and gas exploration			2
low levels of radioactivity may be remaining from the work , though not at harmful levels , officials say			1
' out of abundance of caution and because of the ongoing incident , i have decided to further enhance our monitoring efforts , ' @entity121 secretary @entity120 said in a statement			0
officials said the first set of 15 samples from the area show that there are no detectable levels of naturally occurring radioactive material on the surface of the sinkhole and @entity138 said they 're confident residents are n't at risk of exposure			1
evacuated : residents remain evacuated from the area @entity110 spokesman @entity145 said such material tends to accumulate in low levels on equipment used to drill for oil and gas			1
gas bubbles have been erupting in the area for weeks			1
residents have been especially alarmed at the possibility of a natural gas explosion after 28 residents in @entity157 had to evacuate their homes on christmas 2003 because natural gas was seeping from a salt dome storage cavern and bubbling up into water wells			1
residents have also been reporting earthquakes but despite a battery of tests conducted by federal , parish and local officials , no one has been able to figure out the source of the tremors			2
@entity171 , who lives in @entity157 and owns a body shop in @entity173 , said he 'd noticed tremors for years			2
he eventually moved out of his house because he did n't feel safe and has been unable to sell it because the property value plummeted after several small sinkholes opened up in his yard			2
before : the sinkhole was much smaller last thursday , pictured scientists said at a community meeting last tuesday the sinkhole might be related to a brine cavern owned by @entity186 - based @entity185 contained within an underground salt dome			1
it has been reported that local officials at @entity185 have known since at least january 2011 that there have been problems with the structural integrity of a brine cavern that was plugged in june 2010			0
officials did not mention those issues at the meeting			0
' it 's what i 've been saying all along , that they 've been hiding things , ' @entity171 said			0
' i think our local officials are trying to do the best they can , but i think they 're being hindered by the higher - ups hiding things			2
' @entity171 said he was especially worried after a parish official had him fill out a form asking him to list his next of kin last thursday morning			0
' that 's a little disturbing to me			0
they said it 's in case they ca n't reach us to evacuate			0
but i mean , come on			0
they can reach everyone , ' he said			0
rep. @entity218 , @entity219 , said he wanted more transparency and answers from the @entity222			0
he said he had no idea about structural issues within the brine cavern until he read about them in the paper			0
' there is a serious lack of competence now in the state , and we knew nothing			0
why did they close the mine ? we did n't get any answers			0
it 's a real lack of competence now , ' @entity218 said			0
some residents in the area said that they had been experiencing tremors for years before the enormous sinkhole opened up @entity244 , spokesman for @entity185 , said they were continuing to monitor the area for any changes			1
' we 've installed booms around the perimeter of the sinkhole to contain any floating contaminants , the diesel , anything else , ' @entity244 said			0
dr. @entity253 , director of the state @entity256 ' oil and gas division , said the sinkhole could have been caused by structural problems within the salt dome that sits underneath it			2
the wall of salt between the brine cavern and the salt dome might be thinner than experts were led to believe , he said			0
he said this sinkhole was unusual because it sits on the edge of the dome , when sinkholes normally sit right on top			0
the owners of four natural gas pipelines nearby were asked to depressurize and vent off their pipelines as a precaution after the slurry area bent a 400 - foot - long section of pipeline			1
governor @entity277 declared a state of emergency friday in @entity44 and ordered an immediate evacuation of 150 homes and several businesses			0
the evacuation remains in effect			0
low levels of radioactivity may be emanating , though not at harmful levels , officials said officials said last friday that it will be at least 40 days before they get definitive answers about an enormous sinkhole that opened up in @entity44			1
@entity292 , president of @entity293 , a subsidiary of @entity294 , said the company spent the last week ' intensely focused ' on an emergency response as they try to figure out the cause behind a sinkhole near @entity112			0
@entity292 said they 'll be drilling a relief well to investigate a brine cavern they own , which is housed within the @entity219 salt dome			0
it will take at least 40 days to drill the well , and scientists have speculated that the sinkhole might be related to structural problems within the cavern			2
' our efforts are going to be more focused on diagnostics , and looking into what caused this event , ' @entity292 said at a press conference in @entity316			0
commissioner of conservation @entity317 ordered the company last thursday to drill a well and investigate the salt cavern and ' further evaluate potential causes of the subsidence near its well site , ' as well as obtain samples of cavern content			0
@entity292 said the company was just as shocked as anyone else when the sinkhole erupted two weeks ago , swallowing up an acre of bald cypress trees and leaving diesel fumes and slurry water in its wake .			1

huge 400 - foot deep hole swallows another 50 - feet of land today
two clean - up workers had to be rescued by air boat as their vessel disappeared into the pool of water
fears remain that low levels of radiation are being *emitted* from the sinkhole
gas bubbles have been bubbling in the @entity3 bayou for weeks and residents have felt small tremors for years
scientists expect it to continue growing
some residents have *refused* to leave their homes
