@entity1 sen. @entity0 sent a strong signal tuesday to 2016 - watchers that @entity4 is n't dead as a presidential campaign issue , slamming former secretary of state @entity6 for failing to prevent the 2012 terror attack in the @entity9 port city that killed the @entity11 ambassador and three other @entity11 personnel			1
' we have to defend ourselves , ' he told a conservative audience at a summit hosted by @entity16			1
' we also have to defend our diplomatic missions around the world			0
' ' i put a lot of blame at the feet of @entity6 for not defending the embassy – or the consulate – in @entity4			1
i think she did a terrible job			2
and i think that it 's inexcusable , basically , when you 're asked for security that you not provide it			0
' @entity0 added in a calculated barb at @entity6 , who is the @entity33 's presumptive 2016 front - runner , that protecting @entity11 assets ' is the job of the commander - in - chief , and that is the job of the executive branch			1
@entity0 in @entity56 have never let the issue go , hosting a ricocheting series of @entity60 hearings in a handful of different @entity63 committees before consolidating their gripes last year into a single investigative panel helmed by @entity67 rep. @entity66			2
with democrats in control of the @entity71 until last week , however , @entity56 's upper chamber saw little action on the controversy that bombarded the entire @entity75 administration , for a time , with unrelenting partisan barba			0
@entity0 and a few other hard - charging @entity77 , including @entity79 sen. @entity78 , have taken every opportunity to be heard on @entity4 , including tuesday 's quick departure into partisan cage - fighting			1
@entity6 led @entity11 's diplomatic corps when the terror attack erupted , and later enraged @entity0 by suggesting in @entity71 testimony that it made little difference whether it was planned or spontaneously erupted			1
her expected @entity63 run could be complicated by unresolved questions related to the scandal			0
@entity0 's comments came a day before he is scheduled to barnstorm through the early presidential primary state of @entity94 , making six meet - and - greet stops on wednesday in the space of eight hours			1
on tuesday the @entity1 senator was answering a question about @entity11 's proper role in arbitrating disputes in the @entity101			2
' i think that no matter what we do , we have to defend ourselves , ' the senator said			0
' so printing cartoons – it should n't engender people murdering you			0
so we do have to protect ourselves			0
@entity110 has to defend themselves			0
' @entity0 is seen as a small - government @entity0 whose potential presidency would resist the temptation to intervene in global conflicts			2
' i do n't want to be in the middle of the " long war			0
" he said tuesday , ' because i do n't think there really is an answer in this long war and that much of this war should be left to be fought by the @entity101			0
' but ' we ca n't leave our embassies unprotected , ' he added , resuming his swipe at @entity6			2
' so we have a couple of choices : we either come home completely , and bring everything home , or we defend our embassies and our interests			0
at this point , what i would say is that we defend our interests			0
' devastation : the 2012 attack killed four people including @entity11 ambassador to @entity9 @entity139 , and was carried out by an @entity141 - affiliated group called @entity142 a senior aide to another @entity0 senator told @entity145 that @entity0 is having a hard time threading the needle			1
' @entity0 is fighting a losing battle , ' the aide said			0
' you ca n't tell one audience that we have to isolate ourselves and then tell another one that @entity6 was n't tough enough on @entity9 terrorists			1
' but @entity0 's camp is insisting that he wo n't waver on @entity6			1
the senator ' believes mrs. @entity6 ’s dereliction of duty and indifferent response to the tragic events that occurred in @entity4 are utterly inexcusable , ' randpac communications director @entity162 told @entity145 ' as he stated during her appearance before the @entity165 , senator @entity0 would have removed secretary @entity6 from her post ' if he had been president at the time			1
' senator @entity0 declared @entity9 as " @entity167 , " @entity162 added , ' due to her desire to act unilaterally without @entity56 approval or authorization , thus circumventing @entity56			2
' but the senator finds himself triangulated between condemning both the kind of proactive @entity101 nation - flattening that characterized the @entity175 administration , and the more reluctant participation that has marked @entity75 's time in office			0
' every time we 've gotten involved to topple a secular dictator , it 's been replaced by chaos and the rise of radical @entity185 , ' @entity0 said			1
' and that would be in @entity6 's war in @entity9 ; that would also be in the @entity0 war in @entity190			1
' ' @entity191 ' : sen. @entity0 took time during his q&a on tuesday to bash @entity6 over the 2012 @entity4 terror attacks @entity0 signaled a willingness to grab hold of @entity0 ' hard line on @entity199 terror , less than a week after a dozen staffers of the @entity202 humor weekly @entity203 were slaughtered over cartoonish depictions of the @entity185 prophet @entity205			1
' printing cartoons , ' he said , ' should n't engender people murdering you			0
' he staked out less emotional territory , however , by outlining what he said was ' a war going on between what i call civilized @entity185 and barbaric @entity185			2
' ' some conservatives like to criticise the president and say , " why is he being so nice to @entity185 ? " i think sometimes what he 's trying to do is point out that there 's a difference			1
' believing that ' everybody in @entity185 is an enemy of the @entity11 , ' he warned , assumes a future that includes ' a horrific , terrible kind of war with , you know , a billion people hating @entity11			1
' ' i do n't think that 's true			0
i think the vast majority of @entity185 is peace - loving and civilized			0
but if it 's 5 or 10 per cent of @entity185 , that 's a lot of people			2

@entity234 *firebrand* starts *pummelling* the presumptive @entity33 *frontrunner* a day before barnstorming through @entity94
i put a lot of blame at the feet of @entity6 for not defending the consulate in @entity4 , ' sen. @entity0 told a conservative audience ; ' i think she did a terrible job '
*complains* that secular dictators *deposed* by the @entity11 are ' replaced by chaos and the rise of radical @entity185 – and that would be in @entity6 's war in @entity9 '
*islamist* radicals stormed the @entity11 consulate in @entity4 , @entity9 on *september* 11 , 2012 , creating a rallying point for the @entity0 's right wing
@entity0 will likely need to compete with sen. @entity78 in 2016 for the hearts and minds of conservatives in the @entity0 's base
