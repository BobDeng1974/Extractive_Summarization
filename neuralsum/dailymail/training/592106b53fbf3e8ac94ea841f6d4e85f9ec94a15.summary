the objects were then purchased by the @entity33 @entity39 from @entity31 in 1816 and presented by @entity39 to the @entity4 , where they have been resided since			0
the subject of their return to @entity36 has become both a political and national issue , with the @entity36 demanding they be sent back to their country of origin , while @entity47 's @entity4 has insisted they stay in @entity48			0
it does not attract as many visitors as the museum 's glamorous @entity23 , which famously @entity36 demanded be returned , but is now at the centre of a dispute as both sides lay down their reasons for claiming rightful ownership			0
found in southern @entity1 in 1882 , it has been in @entity33 for decades , after sir @entity59 , the museum 's director of excavations , purchased it in 1927			1
the slab , has an image of ancient @entity64 carved out , greeting @entity65			0
it has a large hole drilled through the middle because it has been used as a olive press in the past			0
@entity1 's letter in january is not a one - off , they have recently demanded the return of several pieces worldwide in recent years			1

@entity113 stakes : the stone slab does not attract as many visitors as the museum 's famous @entity23 , pictured , but is now at the centre of a dispute as both sides lay down their reasons for claiming rightful ownership claim : found in southern @entity1 in 1882 , the slab was purchases in 1927 , by sir @entity59 , the museum 's director of excavations the @entity4 have considered the request for the past few months , but last week its director @entity127 , replied to @entity1			1
' at no point between 1927 and 2005 have the @entity1 authorities , who were fully aware of the stele 's location , suggested that it has been improperly acquired or should be returned , ' stated the museum			2
although a claim was made for the stele in 2005 , it was not pursued by the @entity1 authorities and loans between the two countries continued			2
in a statement the museum was keen to stress it wanted relations between the two countries to remain civil			0
' @entity144 greatly values the cordial relationship it has enjoyed with @entity1 colleagues over recent years which has led to fruitful collaborations			2
' as a compromise the museum did offer to lend the disputed artifact to @entity1 if the country recognises the @entity4 's ownership - there was a similar offer with the @entity23			2
but it also made clear that it was not willing to return the object on a permanent basis : ' the trustees of the @entity4 can not consent to the transfer of ownership of the stele and firmly believe that it should remain part of the @entity4 â€™s collection where it can be seen in a world context by a global audience			0
' refusal : the @entity4 will not return the @entity22 but have said they are willing to temporarily loan it to @entity1			0
