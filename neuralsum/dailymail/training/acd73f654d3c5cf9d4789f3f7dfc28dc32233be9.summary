let 's fly away : @entity4 's squad pose ahead of their departure for the @entity27 no room : nine of the squad were forced to downgrade to economy class after it emerged their plane was too small checking in : @entity33 visited pals @entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) in economy class just the ticket : @entity33 arrives at @entity39 in @entity40 ahead of the flight @entity35 ( @entity42 ) 24 years old , 2 caps @entity44 ( @entity42 ) 26 years old , 12 caps @entity46 ( @entity42 ) 24 years old , 1 cap @entity48 ( @entity49 ) 21 years old , 0 caps @entity51 ( @entity52 ) 30 years old , 0 caps @entity36 ( @entity54 ) 23 years old , 5 caps @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , 21 years old , 11 caps @entity59 ( @entity60 ) 26 years old , 13 caps @entity62 ( @entity52 ) 29 years old , 4 caps that group included @entity35 , the @entity42 striker who top scored in @entity65 last season , and he was joined by @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity48 , @entity51 , @entity36 , @entity56 , @entity67 @entity62			1

but coach @entity83 claims @entity4 's form - they are without a win in seven matches - is irrelevant when it comes to their preparations for the finals			1
' i did n't see anything worrying , quite the opposite , ' he said			0
' right now we do n't need to be talking about results			0
you need to look at the physical condition of the players , and we are in great physical condition			0
' yes , we 're missing a bit of flair and oomph for now but the point of this preparation is to arrive in @entity5 in the right manner			0
' psychologically a player going to the @entity27 just wants to get through that match ( @entity81 )			0
we did n't put in tackles and we did n't go in with huge determination or will to win			0
' main man : star player @entity112 ( pictured arriving in @entity5 ) will be key to @entity4 's chances dressed to impress : @entity33 looked the part as he arrived in @entity10 safe hands : @entity116 will be charged with manning the posts for the @entity118 touch down : @entity4 's players disembark following their flight from @entity40			1
