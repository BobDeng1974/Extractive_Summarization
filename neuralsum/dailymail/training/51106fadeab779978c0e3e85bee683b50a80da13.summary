’ @entity11 is thought to have escaped from his hutch before climbing onto the gutter and up to the roof			1
adventurous : the three - storey block of flats where @entity11 was rescued from in @entity13 , @entity14 @entity48 , of @entity49 , explained that firefighers had trouble because they could not get the aerial ladder platform in , so instead had to use a roof ladder to get to the stranded bunny			1

we ’ve got two guys on the watch who are retiring soon and they ’ve never been to anything like it in 30 years			0

i kept thinking he was going to fall down because he was slipping down the roof tiles as he got higher and higher ' @entity18 ‘ normally , when we work at heights , we have the aerial ladder platform out but we could n’t get it in so that proved to be a problem			2
