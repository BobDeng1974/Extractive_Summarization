a kidnapped journalist who survived @entity1 has told of the blood - chilling moment the @entity3 extremist ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck in a mock execution at an @entity10 prison			1
@entity11 , a spaniard captured alongside colleagues while reporting the conflict between president @entity15 's regime and militant soldiers in 2013 , was freed last year after a deal was brokered between his government and front - line extremists			1
he had spent months at the mercy of @entity21 , the @entity3 hooded executioner now ominously referred to as @entity1 , and other terrorists while in captivity			1
in an harrowing account printed by the @entity42 , he relives the moment @entity21 , now the world 's most wanted man , ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck , threatening execution			1
' he caressed my neck with the blade but kept talking : " feel it ? @entity53 , is n't it ? can you imagine the pain you 'll feel when it cuts ? unimaginable pain , " ' mr @entity11 wrote			1
it was , he continued , one of ' several episodes of psychological and physical torture , privations and humiliations ' prisoners endured			0
@entity21 , who ' wanted maximum drama ' , was among ' psychotic ' extremists who pillaged the @entity11 's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars			1
it was , he continued , one of ' several episodes of psychological and physical torture , privations and humiliations ' prisoners endured			0
mr @entity11 was snatched with his colleague photographer @entity76 when the pair were working near the @entity79 border in 2013			1
mr @entity11 and his colleague @entity76 were kept alongside other hostages for months @entity21 ( right before joining extremists in @entity83 and left in his trademark hood ) was among mr @entity11 's captors alongside @entity88 journalists and aid workers including @entity3 @entity90 and @entity91 , they were locked in @entity10 prisons - as mr @entity11 describes them ' elegant mansions ' and the former government headquarters in @entity95 - across the war - ravaged country for months			1
while their comrades have all but been murdered - @entity98 is seemingly still alive but in the group 's clutches - the two @entity30 were freed , spared to tell the world of the group 's atrocities			1
among the most horrifying anecdotes was a threat to exhume the body of murdered @entity110 engineer @entity109 and make remaining hostages sleep next to his bullet - riddled head			0
' they liked scaring their captives , forcing us to look at photos of @entity118 ... " you might end up with him , ' recalled mr @entity11			1
' " we 'll make you dig him up and put you in another tomb where you can sleep with him			0
" ' being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace			2
on one occasion , the @entity11 notes , a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive @entity131 law			1
the @entity133 and @entity88 hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved , mr @entity11 claims to have been told			1
instead they were being picked off one by own , their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos			0
while the journalist does n't describe in depth any hopes he had of escaping , he revealed that asking his captors how to pray was among his first actions once taken			1
in march last year mr @entity11 , a veteran journalist for the @entity30 national newspaper @entity144 , and mr @entity76 were taken into the care of @entity79 authorities after six months of captivity			1
once across the border he contacted his newspaper and his wife who later tweeted : ' pure happiness '			0
to secure his release the @entity30 government is understood to have paid a sum to the terror group			1
@entity157 , @entity158 , and @entity159 are other countries to have complied with extremists demands to ensure the release of kidnapped citizens			2
@entity3 and the @entity88 are the only two to have stayed true to a @entity165 agreement not to give in to such requests			2
as a result , jihadis claim , a handful of journalists and aid workers from both countries have been slaughtered			0
his first victim : @entity88 journalist @entity175 was the first @entity176 citizen to have been killed on film by @entity1 in a sickening propaganda video slaughtered : @entity3 @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by the group @entity21 was unmasked as @entity1 the son of a @entity183 minicab driver , young @entity21 arrived in @entity3 speaking only a few words of @entity185 , and appeared more interested in football than in @entity187			1
he went to mosque with his family , who spoke @entity190 to each other , but wore @entity176 clothing and became popular with his @entity3 classmates at @entity194 primary school in @entity196 , @entity197			2
after finishing primary school in 1999 , young @entity21 moved to @entity198 , in @entity199 , where he is believed to have studied alongside former x factor judge and pop star @entity201			2
once there , he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional @entity187 dress , and his sisters began to wear the hijab			0
the university has since been linked with several proponents of radical @entity187 , and @entity21 appeared to have fallen under their sway			0
he began attending different mosques and was known to associate with @entity211 , who was killed by a drone strike in @entity213 three years ago			0
in august 2009 , after his graduation , @entity21 flew to @entity215 in @entity216 with friends and told authorities they were going on a wildlife safari			0
but the group was refused entry and put on a plane to the @entity224 , where @entity21 later claimed he was questioned by an @entity226 agent called @entity227			2
the @entity3 officer accused him of planning to travel to @entity213 to join the militant group @entity229 , he said , and said @entity226 had been watching him			1
@entity21 denied the accusation – bragging that he would not take a designer @entity232 sweater in his luggage if he was planning to join @entity213 rebels			0
in emails to the campaign group @entity238 , @entity21 said : ‘ he [ @entity227 ] knew everything about me ; where i lived , what i did , the people i hanged around with			0
’ ‘ @entity227 ’ then tried to recruit the 21 - year - old , @entity21 claimed , and threatened him when he refused to cooperate			0
@entity21 said the officer told him : ‘ you ’re going to have a lot of trouble … you ’re going to be known … you ’re going to be followed … life will be harder for you			0
’ on his return to @entity3 , @entity21 said his family told him they had been ‘ visited ’ , and he claimed a woman he had been planning to marry broke off their engagement because her family had also been contacted and were scared			2
according to @entity21 , his family then began planning for him to travel to @entity183 to get him away from the ‘ harassment ’ he had suffered in @entity3 and he went to work for a computer programming company in the emirate			2
in 2013 after changing his name by deed poll he made another attempt to enter @entity183 but was rejected			0
