flag row : the @entity1 backtracked after telling a town hall they could not fly the @entity3 at half mast it was to be a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the @entity10			1
but then a top @entity12 official decided that flying the @entity3 at half - mast on august 4 could confuse the public into thinking someone important had died			1
organisers in @entity17 , @entity18 , were upset and disappointed at the insistence by senior policy advisor @entity20 that permission had to be given by the @entity22 or prime minister			1
she said that flying flags at half - mast was not intended ‘ to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events ’			1
but yesterday , after protests , the @entity1 backtracked and admitted it had no control over flag flying			1
councillor @entity33 , who arranged the event , said : ‘ i did feel quite upset			2
it felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives			2
many local people felt the same way			2
’ the original refusal came after @entity17 town clerk @entity42 asked permission to lower the flag on their town hall as a traditional mark of respect			1
ms @entity20 replied in an email : ' while flags flying in general is deregulated , individuals , groups or organisations can not chose when to fly a flag at half - mast			1
' an instruction for the half - masting of flags can only be given by @entity22 ( or by or the @entity58 with approval from @entity60 ) to mark the death of a member of the royal family or an important statesperson , or to mark a tragedy has just happened rather than to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events			1
' as i am sure you will agree , any independent half - masting of flags may confuse other people into thinking that an important figure has just died , for example a member of the @entity75			2
' flags are not flown at half - mast for the @entity79 service for example and i hope you can devise another fitting way to pay your local tribute as part of the commemorations of the @entity10			2
' organisers in @entity17 , @entity18 , wanted to make a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the @entity10 but as the ban threatened to spark a row the government backed down and admitted they had no jurisdiction on flag flying - and there are no official rules			1
a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' decisions on whether to fly flags at half - mast are not made by @entity89			1
' orders on when to fly flags at half - mast are taken by @entity60 and occur in response to the death of a prominent statesperson or member of the @entity75			0
' any decision to fly flags at half - mast outside of these occasions would be for local authorities themselves			0
' cadets march past the @entity114 in @entity17 during an earlier remembrance event the centenary event will see the @entity118 cadets stage a vigil , and include a church service and music to remember those who gave their lives			0
it has been arranged by councillor @entity33 who said the original refusal on flying the flag at half - mast had been ' upsetting and disappointing '			1
she said : ' i must say i really did feel quite upset			0
' it felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives			0
' i was very upset to think that we could not mark those ten million lives lost by lowering the flag and i know very many local people felt the same way - very disappointed			2
' resident @entity136 , 54 , who staged a 24 - hour vigil at the foot of the cenotaph in 2007 to fight plans to move it , slammed the government 's intrusion			0
he said : ' it should be nothing to do with the government - why should the government dictate what we as people want to do ? ' they decide enough of what we do and this should n't be a political dilemma			0
' let people feel that feeling how they want to feel it and stop being so critical			0
they should n't interfere and meddle in how people want to commemorate - especially young people			0
' councillor @entity163 said the government 's refusal was ' very sad indeed '			0
he said : ' people wo n't be confused - everyone around the country will know that that day is to commemorate @entity10 and the tragic consequence that had for many millions of people and families around the world and in our community			0
' colleague councillor @entity175 added : ' it is totally bureaucratic			0
' i do n't think the government or royalty has anything to do with it at all			0
and i expect if the @entity22 knew anything about it she would overturn it immediately			1
