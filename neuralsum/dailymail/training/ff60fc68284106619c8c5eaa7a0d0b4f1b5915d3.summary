' the inquest also heard that mr @entity46 had been told that @entity8 had muttered ' he should be put down ' about @entity15 , during a another group session two days before he attacked him			1
however , mr @entity46 said @entity8 ’s fantasies were noted but not viewed as a serious problem as it was encouraged behaviour			2
' in therapy , if someone begins to talk about fantasies it is seen as a good thing , as they are alerting us to thought processes , ' he said			0

she described @entity15 as unique in his presentation on the wing and said he upset other members of his group in therapy by talking about his vile offences before the group had become familiar with one another and comfortable discussing their crimes			1
' we suggest people get to know them first before they talk about their offences as prisoners , and people on the outside , find it very difficult to listen to details of sexual offending against a child , ' said mrs @entity111			0
' we likened it [ @entity15 discussing his offences before people were ready ] to his offending , as he was forcing something that was n’t ready to happen			2
' however , she said that there had been no feud or animosity between @entity15 and @entity8 prior to the murder and the pair had little to do with one another			1
inquest : officials told @entity126 there were concerns over placing @entity15 in @entity10 an inmate , named only as @entity130 , said the incident took place as @entity8 went round cells demanding his cds and games be returned			1

' the inquest heard that at one point the man who had taken issue with him got up and left			0
he returned and @entity15 later got up and left , followed by the other man			2
' i believe it was at this point that i heard @entity8 say " people like that should be put down " , ' said ms @entity145			2
@entity15 and the man then returned and the meeting concluded , with no issues reported at a later staff meeting			0

this is followed by another three months on regular wings			0
throughout , their engagement with therapy sessions is assessed by @entity199 prisoner 's operational manager @entity194 said @entity15 ’s murder was the first violent death in the prison ’s history and that violent attacks were very rare as prisoners knew that violence would mean they were forced to @entity207 added : ' by the end of their sentence , prisoners should understand their offending behaviour , confront it and obtain help for it			1
