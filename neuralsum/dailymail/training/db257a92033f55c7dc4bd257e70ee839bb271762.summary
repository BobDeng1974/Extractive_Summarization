a bidding - war is stirring among high flying millionaires in a desperate move to snap up the worlds first aeroplane car - which is up for sale for £ 600,000 with cars and congestion becoming too much for commuters in the 1940s , pioneering inventor @entity11 developed a way to soar above the rest the @entity16 was set to take the world by storm but after almost 25 years of campaigning @entity11 still could still not strike a deal - he even lost a deal with auto giants @entity33			1
along with the original prototype , only four others were ever built and madcap collectors are battling to own the startling piece of engineering history - which is still able to cruise at 110mph			1
@entity40 , of aviation enthusiast @entity41 , said : ' this was the peak of 20th century design at the time and was close to taking the world 's imagination by storm			0
the first - ever @entity16 was built in 1949 and successfully proved that the roadster - complete with folding wings to keep it a street - worthy size - could be done the @entity16 's creator was a gifted aeronautical engineer who was ' crazy about airplanes ' and the battle to become a proud owner of the car has been extreme ' there really was nothing like it around at the time and the design attracted so much attention - it was such an incredibly advanced piece of kit			1
' it was on the front of newspapers , magazines , books and on tv shows across the globe - it 's popularity was unprecedented			2
' but the oil crash in the 1970s and a lack of businesses willing to invest eventually led to all interest fizzling away - to this day there is still nothing like it			2
' not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a car , but its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer the @entity16 was set to take the world by storm but after almost 25 years of campaigning , @entity11 still could still not strike a deal - he even lost a deal with auto giant @entity33 engine : @entity94 0 - 320 , 4 - cylinder , rated at 150 hp @entity96 ( as an airplane ) : 21ft @entity98 ( as an airplane ) : 7 ft. 2 in length of car portion : 10 ft 4 in length of trailer portion : 13 ft width of trailer : 8 @entity104 : 30 @entity105 : 6 ft. 3 @entity106 : 168 sq. @entity109 ( car ) width : 44 @entity110 : 24 cu. @entity111 : 2,100 @entity112 : 1,300 @entity113 w / 24 gal. fuel : 656 @entity115 : 24 @entity116 : 7 @entity117 : 300 miles the 21ft @entity16 is a two - place aircraft with side - by - side seating , four wheels , 30ft wingspan and a single @entity94 0 - 320 engine mounted over the rear wheels			1
the propeller is mounted at the end of a long tail cone , and the latter is angled up considerably , to provide adequate propeller clearance			2
its cruise speed is 100mph , and it initially sold for $ 25,000			0
not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a road - going car , but also its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer			1
the idea for the @entity16 occurred to its designer @entity11 in 1946			0
after meeting inventor @entity142 he became captivated by the concept of his flying car			2
@entity145 immediately saw the weakness in the fixed , detachable wings of @entity142 's design , and set about building his prototype @entity16 with folding wings , which he completed in 1949			0
after a successful demonstration flight , @entity145 promoted the @entity16 at aircraft and auto shows and on tv			0
as the flood of inquiries poured in , @entity145 raised money to certify the machine as an airplane , and to build four ' pre-production ' @entity161 for demonstrations and eventual sale			1
@entity11 built his first ' production ' @entity16 in 1954 and flew them , as he attempted to develop a market into the early 1960s			0
he used fiberglass on the cars ' outer panels to keep the weight down and developed a front wheel drive because the rear wheels were used for landing			1
takeoff speed was 55 mph and the airplane was controlled with the same steering wheel			0
one @entity16 is owned by the @entity179 museum group , one is in the @entity181 museum and two are in private hands @entity145 was a gifted aeronautical engineer who was ' crazy about airplanes ' and the battle to become a proud owner of the car has been extreme			0
@entity40 said : ' there are four surviving @entity161 out of five built			1
one is owned by the @entity179 museum group , one is in the @entity181 museum and two are in private hands			0
' the prototype for the next generation is in the @entity195 museum in @entity196			0
' it 's a really rare chance to buy this			0

only four of the five ' @entity161 ' ever built in the 1940s are still in existence
it cruises at 110mph and *easily* converts from airplane to road - going car
car is a 21ft long , two - place aircraft with seating for two , a 30ft wingspan and single @entity94 0 - 320 engine mounted over rear wheels
wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer
