@entity0 is to release 65 prisoners from a former @entity3 prison today despite protests from the @entity3 military , which says the men are @entity7 fighters who will likely return to the battlefield to kill coalition and @entity0 forces			1
the move further strains relations between @entity13 and president @entity14 , whose increasingly anti-american rhetoric and refusal to sign a long - negotiated bilateral security deal has increased uncertainty ahead of the year - end withdrawal of most international combat troops			2
@entity14 ordered the detainees released several weeks ago , after his government took over the prison from @entity3 troops			1
@entity3 forces in @entity0 say some of the men are responsible for killing or wounding dozens of international and @entity0 soldiers as well making bombs that have killed civilians			2
the prisoners were freed just after 9 a.m. from the @entity41 near @entity42 , about 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) north of @entity43 , according to prison spokesman maj. @entity44			2
they boarded a bus to leave the facility , laughing and smiling , he said			0
the @entity3 has argued for the detainees to face trial in @entity0 courts - citing strong evidence against them , from dna linking them to roadside bombs to explosive residue on their clothing - but @entity43 has cited insufficient proof to hold them			2
@entity14 has referred to the @entity41 prison as a ' @entity7 - producing factory ' where innocent @entity0 are tortured into hating their country			1

the move further strains relations between @entity13 and president @entity14 a statement from the @entity86 in @entity43 on thursday called the release ' deeply regrettable ' and called on @entity14 's government to ensure those released do not commit new acts of violence			1
' we requested a thorough review of each case			0
instead , the evidence against them was never seriously considered , ' the embassy statement said , adding , ' the @entity0 government bears responsibility for the results of its decision			2
' @entity103 spokesman @entity102 would not comment on @entity3 concerns			0
' our responsibility is the protection of the prisoners			0
that is all , ' @entity102 said by telephone			0
the 65 were among 88 detainees at the facility that are the subject of dispute between @entity43 and @entity13			0
the @entity3 says that they are dangerous members of the @entity7 insurgency , the @entity114 of militants and other @entity117 radicals bent on fighting foreign and @entity0 government forces			1
among those believed to have walked free thursday morning was @entity122 , who the @entity3 military says is a suspected @entity7 explosives expert who allegedly placed roadside bombs targeting @entity0 and international forces			1
the military said @entity122 had been biometrically linked to two roadside explosions and had a latent fingerprint match on another improvised explosive device			0
he had also tested positive for explosives residue			0
the @entity3 only recently transferred the prison at @entity42 to @entity0 control after it had become a serious source of tension with the government in @entity0 which is fighting a @entity7 - led insurgency about 30 percent had participated in direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 @entity3 and coalition troops , a @entity3 official said others in the group include @entity143 - who the @entity3 says was captured with extensive weapons - and a man identified as @entity146 , who is claimed to have been biometrically matched to a roadside bomb and who tested positive for explosives residue			1
the @entity3 military had formally disputed the prisoners ' release , but an @entity0 review board had effectively overruled those challenges			0
the detainees ' release has been in the works for weeks , and comes as @entity14 has taken an increasingly hostile tone toward the @entity3 ahead of the withdrawal of @entity160 combat troops at the end of 2014			1
the president has refused to sign a @entity163 would allow about 10,000 @entity3 troops and about 6,000 from allied nations to remain in @entity0 past 2014 , largely to help train @entity0 security forces to take over the fight against the @entity7 and other militants 13 years after the international military intervention in the wake of the sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the @entity3 the @entity160 - backed coalition toppled the @entity7 's regime of hard - line islamic law for sheltering the @entity176 leadership behind the @entity3 attacks			1
@entity14 had tentatively endorsed the bilateral security deal after it was completed last october , but after it was approved by a council of tribal elders known as the @entity181 in november , he refused to sign it - saying he wants his successor to decide about it after the april 5 presidential election			0
@entity14 can not run because he is ineligible to serve a third term			0
the @entity3 wants the deal signed as soon as possible because it needs time to prepare to keep thousands of @entity3 troops in the country for up to a decade			1
