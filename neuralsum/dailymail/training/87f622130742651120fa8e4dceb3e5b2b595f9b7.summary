a nine - months pregnant teenager who claims she was raped by seven men in @entity2 is now facing the death penalty after being charged with adultery			1
the married @entity6 woman was just 18 years old , and three months pregnant , when she was subjected to the attack in august last year			1
she says she was searching for a new home in @entity9 , near the capital @entity11 , and one of the seven accused lured her into an empty property on the premises of renting it out to her and her husband			2
unbelievable brutality : the pregnant @entity6 teenager was raped by seven men after being lured into an empty building near the @entity2 capital of @entity11 , on the premise of renting the property ( stock image ) she was attacked and held down while a group of men , reportedly aged between 18 and 22 , took turns in raping her , according to the @entity29 for women in the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) network			1
her ordeal was filmed by one of the perpetrators and was circulated on social media via @entity38 several months after the attack			1
when the video of the rape surfaced , the woman and the alleged rapists were arrested and accused of making and distributing indecent material and indecent behaviour			2
after first being denied bail , and later charged with prostitution and adultery , the woman is now being prevented from making a formal complaint of rape			1
@entity2 media reporting the case has tried to undermine the woman 's story by claiming she has @entity56 and is a prostitute , @entity32 said			1
the woman is being held by police and refused to report the rape by the @entity2 attorney general as she is being investigated for adultery and incident behaviour ( stock image ) ' the intention to place culpability on the part of the victim is of great concern and seeks to deflect and reduce accountability of the perpetrators , but more disturbing is that the charge of adultery carries with it the potential sentence of death by stoning if found guilty , ' @entity32 said			1
' there have even been cynical attempts to falsely claim that the men were accidently prescribed hallucinogenic drugs by a chemist beforehand			2
' ' impunity and silence on crimes of sexual violence committed against @entity86 [ internally displaced persons ] , migrants and impoverished women in @entity2 has been a pattern for years , ' @entity80 , regional director of the @entity32 network , told the @entity91			2
' successful prosecution of rape is the exception as opposed to the norm and most certainly does not reflect the level of incidence			0
' instead victims face the risk that they will instead be prosecuted for adultery , being re-vicitmised by the judicial system , and threatened with the ultimate sentence of death by stoning			2
' according to @entity32 , the attorney general has denied her the right to report the rape as she is currently under investigation for the other charges			0
the attorney general also argues that she should have reported the rape at the time of the attack			0
however the woman has told her lawyer that the group of men who attacked her threatened to kill her if she told anyone , and as a result , she was too scared to report it			1
she was further deterred by the fact that she told a police officer who found her shortly after the attack what had happened , who dismissed her story			0
the police officer decided against pursuing an investigation as it was @entity131 , a public holiday in the @entity134 country , @entity32 said			0
he has been charged with negligence			0
the teenager was arrested on the 17th of january and despite being close to giving birth , she has since been sleeping on a concrete floor in a cell at a local police station			0
two attempts to secure bail for her on health grounds have been refused			0
a total of ten individuals , including another police officer who helped spread the video , are currently on trial related to this case .			0
