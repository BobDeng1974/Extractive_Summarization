the @entity2 donor who helped to mastermind the stunning defection of @entity4 would consider switching back to the conservatives if @entity6 became leader , he said yesterday			1
@entity8 , the multi-millionaire former @entity9 stalwart who lit the fuse on the ‘ @entity4 coup ’ over a secret lunch , would not return to the conservatives with @entity14 as leader			1
but that could change if @entity6 took over and introduced @entity2 - friendly policies			1
wheeler dealer : mr @entity8 , left , has been wining and dining disaffected @entity9 mps – a process which culminated in last week ’s bombshell announcement by @entity4 , right , that he was defecting mr @entity8 , a former @entity9 donor who was expelled from the party in 2009 after diverting his funding to @entity2 , has been wining and dining disaffected @entity9 mps – a process which culminated in last week ’s bombshell announcement			1
one senior @entity9 , mr @entity8 now reveals , was even wooed by being invited to his 17th @entity26 castle			1
@entity27 , an mep socially and ideologically close to mr @entity4 , has stayed at the @entity28 i listed @entity30 in @entity31 where mr @entity8 lives with wife @entity32 and their three daughters , including the @entity35 model @entity36			1
in an interview with @entity38 , mr @entity8 explained how he had held court with ‘ potential defectors ’ at discreet lunch venues			1
‘ i wrote to about ten @entity43 @entity9 mps saying “ would you like to have lunch with me ? @entity47 , an out - of - the - way restaurant , we wo n’t be seen			1
the only other person who will know is @entity50 ”			0
and @entity4 was one of them			2
’ he dined with mr @entity4 two years ago at @entity54 ’s @entity53 restaurant , which food critics say offers a ‘ sensual dining experience ’ involving dishes such as scallops , squid and lamb @entity60			2
conditions : multi-millionaire mr @entity8 said that he would not return to the conservatives with @entity14 as leader			1
but that could change if @entity6 , right , took over and introduced @entity2 - friendly policies guest : @entity27 , an mep socially and ideologically close to mr @entity4 , has stayed at the @entity28 i listed @entity30 in @entity31 where mr @entity8 lives with wife @entity32 and their three daughters ‘ we discussed everything to do with the @entity74 and @entity14 ’s leadership , ’ said mr @entity8			1
‘ i do n’t think i said “ how about defecting ? ” but i would have said “ would you like to meet @entity76 ? ” and now he has			0
‘ my guess is that he only made his final decision a fortnight ago			0
’ mr @entity8 , 79 , who made his £ 90 million fortune in the spread betting industry , refuses to divulge the names of the other mps he lunched – including two he believes are ‘ close to ’ following mr @entity4 in defecting – but he is an admirer of former defence secretary @entity86 , former shadow home secretary @entity87 and rebellious @entity9 mp @entity88			1
in @entity35 : @entity2 donor @entity8 's daughter @entity36 he invited former @entity9 deputy chairman @entity90 , but the peer declined on the grounds that it would ‘ not be appropriate ’			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ there are a lot of @entity95 i admire			2
an mep i greatly admire is @entity27			0
he has been to stay with me in @entity31 , ’ said mr @entity8 , adding that he could n’t remember what was discussed but : ‘ i am sure we discussed the @entity74 and everything like that ’			2
mr @entity27 stated last week that he did not intend to defect to @entity2			2
no 10 is furious with mr @entity8 , arguing that his ‘ turncoat ’ actions are helping to split the right - wing vote and could allow @entity105 to win next year ’s general election			2
but mr @entity8 refutes their analysis			0
‘ i do n’t think it is going to be like that			0
@entity111 is terrified of us			0
there are a lot of @entity111 constituencies , particularly in the @entity116 , where we are a close second and the @entity95 are a long way behind – it would be greatly to the advantage of the @entity95 if we take the seat			0
so i do n’t think it is likely to let @entity111 in , as the @entity95 are so keen to put about ’			0
what could the @entity95 do to persuade him to return to the fold and bring @entity2 voters with him ? ‘ well , perhaps if mr @entity14 said “ you are right , @entity8 , we should be campaigning to leave the @entity74 and introduce grammar schools and i was wrong about climate change [ existing ] ”			1
‘ but that ’s something which is undoubtedly not going to happen			0
and i think i would prefer not to have @entity14 as a leader either			2
’ he sees an obvious , stand - out alternative			0
‘ @entity6 would be best for getting votes			0
however , him being leader is not enough in itself – if @entity6 introduced those policies [ on the @entity74 , grammar schools and climate change ] then i should think there would quite likely be a deal between the conservatives and @entity2			1
but that is not going to happen ’			0
the businessman said he also rates former environment secretary @entity147 and @entity88 as potential @entity9 leaders			0
mr @entity8 – who added that he regards mr @entity4 as a potential future @entity2 leader – knows that the ‘ @entity4 coup ’ has caused panic in @entity151			1
‘ we have got them rattled , ’ he said			0
‘ they should be rattled			0
