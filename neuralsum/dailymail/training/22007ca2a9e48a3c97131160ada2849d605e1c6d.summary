' for decades , we have been told that the best possible diet involves cutting back on fat , especially saturated fat , and that if we are not getting healthier or thinner it must be because we are not trying hard enough , ' she says			1
' but what if the low - fat diet is itself the problem ? what if those exact foods we â€™ve been denying ourselves - the creamy cheeses , the sizzling steaks - are themselves the key to reversing the epidemics of obesity , diabetes , and heart disease ? ' she documents how the past sixty years of low - fat nutrition advice has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population , with disastrous consequences for our health			2
speaking to the @entity51 , she said : ' there has never been solid evidence for the idea that these [ saturated ] fats cause disease			2
' we only believe this to be the case because nutrition policy has been derailed over the past half - century by a mixture of personal ambition , bad science , politics , and bias			0
