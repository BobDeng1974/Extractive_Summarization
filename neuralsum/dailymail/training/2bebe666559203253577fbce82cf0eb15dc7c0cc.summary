delighted : @entity1 , 43 , gave birth to a healthy baby boy - @entity12 - on 26th june she appeared on @entity25 with husband @entity7 and said : ‘ after @entity15 , i said to @entity14 : “ i ’d love to go through that experience again			1
” i did become pregnant , but sadly miscarried at six weeks			2
then a few months later i fell pregnant again			2
’ when she fell pregnant , the newsreader told the @entity29 : ‘ we ’re absolutely thrilled			1
it came as a complete surprise			0
nobody else could believe it either			0
we feel really , really blessed			0
i ’m still getting my head round it			0
’ when @entity15 was born in november 2011 , miss @entity34 - who lost an ovary during an operation to remove a cyst when she was 29 - had already been through four rounds of @entity20 treatment and had resigned herself to the fact she was unlikely to become a mother			1

it was an utterly gruelling process			0
i was resigned to thinking ‘ what will be , will be ’			0
‘ my husband and i had pretty much given up the idea of me falling pregnant again after @entity15			2
‘ we knew how extremely lucky we were to have had her and we had come to terms with that being our family			0

‘ so many doctors have told me “ it is n’t going to happen , you have less than a two per cent chance of conceiving ”			0
