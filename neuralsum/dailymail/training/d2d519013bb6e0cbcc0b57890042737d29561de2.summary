this series of photographs gives an insight into the elaborate process that @entity10 ovenbirds , also known as @entity11 ( the house builder ) , go through to create their home , complete with a dome - shaped roof			1
using clay or mud mixed with fibres , hair or straw , the male and female ovenbirds work together to build the walls of their nest gradually during the winter months , allowing the tropical sun to bake the mud until it is rock hard			1
then they build a narrow , curved entrance and dividing wall to create the breeding chamber which the female bird lines with grass and feathers , a process which can take months to complete			2
after mating , the female lays three to five eggs that hatch after just 20 days because of the warmth trapped inside the nest			0
