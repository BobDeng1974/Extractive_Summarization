as one of the most successful @entity3 singer - songwriters of the past decade , @entity0 seemed to have it all			1
having sold four million albums since her debut , @entity7 , she toured the world and picked up prestigious @entity10 and @entity11 awards			1
one week , she ’d be in a sequinned dress on the @entity14 red carpet with @entity15 and @entity16			1
the next , she ’d be playing a gig in @entity19 with @entity20 and visiting @entity21 with members of @entity23			2
@entity0 is going back on the road a year after her father died and she split from her husband @entity26 @entity27 , pictured performing yesterday , said her new album ' affirms life ' on a personal level , too , things were going well			1
five years ago , the @entity33 - born singer married @entity26 , the drummer in her band , in a ceremony on the @entity36			1
but last summer , everything changed			2
in august , her father , @entity38 , 73 , a lecturer at @entity40 , died			1
a month later , she and @entity26 separated and are now divorcing			1
facing a ‘ tsunami of emotions ’ , @entity27 admits she is still coming to terms with it all			2
‘ losing @entity45 made me examine my own life , and my priorities have changed , ’ she says			2
‘ he had @entity48 , so he was n’t well			2
but he died as a result of a cycling accident			1
‘ it was very sad , as he was always an impressive man physically			2
he ran marathons and hated getting old			2
but he had lived a good life			2
he did n’t want to stick around in a bad shape			0
’ @entity0 — whose initials are an abbreviation of her real name , @entity58 — is less forthcoming about the end of her marriage , but hints that the pressures of combining professional and personal lives under one roof took their toll			1
‘ being a touring musician can be very intense , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity26 and i played in the band for a year before we got together as a couple , so it was always impossible to untangle our personal lives from the music			1
‘ i could have patched things up , but i did n’t want to do that			0
i ’m nearly 38 , and i ’m a different person			0
music is n’t who i am any more — it ’s what i do			0
’ even before last year ’s momentous events , @entity27 had been getting itchy feet as a musician			0
weary of the treadmill of a major artist , she ’d released a low - key , acoustic ep , @entity83 , before decamping to @entity84 in april 2012 to work with @entity86 musician @entity85 , of alt - country band @entity87			0
her father , @entity38 , a lecturer at @entity40 , died in august aged 73 @entity27 and husband @entity26 , pictured on their wedding , are now divorcing			1
she said it was ' impossible to untangle our personal lives from the music ' those songs , with some recorded in the same studio in november , comprise her fourth studio album , @entity94			1
not surprisingly , the record is her most personal yet			0
a move away from the ‘ stompy , sensitive girl - blues ’ of old , it is a stripped - back , gentle affair , with strings , clarinet and euphonium adding subtle colour			0
it is also a record of two halves — hence the double - headed album title			1
she says : ‘ it would be easy to say i ’ve been gifted traumatic material , but half the songs were written before last summer			0
' maybe my subconscious worked ahead of me			0
‘ the songs written in november are different to the ones written in the spring			0
' the early ones are introspective and uptight , but the second half is more of a rebirth			0
’ now @entity0 is looking forward to playing live again , with this month ’s solo gigs followed by an autumn tour with a full band — though life on the road will also be different this time			1
‘ i ’ve calmed down a lot			0
some people have said they want the old , fun @entity27 back			0
' but i do n’t think she has gone			0
my new record is n’t morose			0
' it ’s not a death or a break - up album			1
it ’s one that affirms life			1

@entity0 said her new album ' affirms live ' despite her recent trauma
father @entity38 died in a cycling accident and she is divorcing @entity26
