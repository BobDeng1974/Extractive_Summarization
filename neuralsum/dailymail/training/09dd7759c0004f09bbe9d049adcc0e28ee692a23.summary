by @entity0 prominent euthanasia campaigner dr @entity1 is being investigated by police , after two @entity4 women sent the controversial doctor a letter in an attempt to justify their alleged suicide pact police are investigating the deaths of two @entity4 women , who allegedly used equipment marketed by @entity12 to commit suicide in march			1
the pair allegedly penned a note to the organisation 's founder , dr @entity1 , prior to committing suicide			1
dr @entity19 , 66 , wrote that she decided to commit suicide after assisting to end the life of her friend @entity22 , 75 , who suffered from alzheimer 's disease			1
dr @entity19 and ms @entity22 lived together as housemates in the northern @entity4 suburb of @entity27			1
in the note , released by @entity12 , dr @entity19 wrote of her distress in not legally being able to assist ms @entity22 in her alleged desire to be euthanised			1
' given the laws that exist at this time in history , what i am obliged to do , i will do , and do willingly , ' dr @entity19 wrote			2
' none of our actions has been taken lightly			0
but neither have they been taken with sorrow or regret			0
' ' for us , this has been an entirely rational decision , taken in full knowledge of contemporary research in the field and experience of working with people who have @entity48 's			0
' dr @entity1 admits the pair attended one of @entity12 's @entity4 workshops in september			1
he also said they were quite open about their plan at meetings of their local @entity12 chapter			0
according to the letter , the pair met 24 years ago when dr @entity19 , who completed post-doctorate studies at @entity61 , had come to @entity62 from the @entity63 to further her career in health research			2
they moved in together after ms @entity22 's mother died , a few years after they met - when dr @entity19 was assisting in research at the hospital at which ms @entity22 served as director of nursing			1
at 50 years old , ms @entity22 was forced to retire due to a serious heart condition			2
but into her retirement , ms @entity22 volunteered alongside dr @entity19 at the @entity76 ' @entity75 programme			1
not one to shy away from controversy : dr @entity1 has said the pair were open about their plan during meetings at their local @entity12 chapter they volunteered until a few months prior to ms @entity22 's diagnosis with @entity48 in march 2013			1
' [ ms @entity22 ] wishes to die having lived a life of joyful giving , at a time when @entity48 's is not just robbing her of words or numeracy but when it starts to rob her of reason and clear decision making , ' dr @entity19 wrote in the letter to dr @entity1			1
' being a technophone , she has also asked me to help her so she does not get this final step wrong and end up in a vegetative state despite her earnest wishes			0
' discussing her reasoning for agreeing to assist ms @entity22 , dr @entity19 added : ' she does not want to die alone			1
therefore , i have made a promise that i will be with her and help her should she need assistance			0
' it is believed dr @entity19 committed suicide after assisting to end the life of ms @entity22			1
courting further potential bad press : dr @entity1 pictured outside his @entity108 euthanasia advisory clinic , which he has admitted to wanting to expand to @entity4 ' the police are obliged to charge me with aiding and abetting a suicide and i am not prepared to undergo the harassment and disgrace of prosecution			2
this leaves me no choice but to join my friend at her time of death , ' the note reads			0
speaking to @entity121 , dr @entity1 said he was ' not too sure what the strongest motivation [ for the suicide ] was			2
' ' but if she 's dying just because she feared prosecution , then that 's tragic , ' dr @entity1 said			2
he said that although the pair purchased the equipment through his organisation , he did not receive the letter until after they had died			0
in @entity133 , assisting a suicide carries a maximum five - year jail sentence			0
six people have been prosecuted under suicide - related laws since 1997			0
dr @entity1 has courted controversy over the years , through his prominent campaigns to have euthanasia legalised			2
he founded the ' dying with dignity ' group @entity12 in 1997 and currently runs a euthanasia advisory clinic in @entity108			0
the @entity143 reported dr @entity1 was looking at potential sites for a clinic in the north @entity4 suburb of @entity147 this week			0
