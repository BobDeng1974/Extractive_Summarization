by @entity1 reporter more rules are being put into place to try and limit mischief during the @entity6 shopping hordes			1
the @entity7 is implementing their parental guidance rule all day on the big shopping day , banning anyone under the age of 16 - years - old has to be accompanied by someone who is over 21			2
the @entity15 , @entity17 mall is one of the most crowded places to be on the busiest shopping day of the year , and though they normally just use the rule on friday and saturday evenings , they are extending those hours this year to stem off trouble			1
to be filled : the @entity7 gets more than 40million visitors each year and they expect more than 200,000 people on @entity6 so they 're trying to cut down on unattended minors on december 27 last year , the chaos of the crowds was coupled with a fight the involved a chair - throwing melee , so this year mall administrators are looking to lessen any damage			1
' we had never opened at midnight on @entity6 prior to last year , ' the mall 's vice president @entity33 told @entity36 's today			1
' we had 217,000 people that day , including some unaccompanied kids who are 14 , 15			2
just for the safety of everyone , we expanded the policy			0
' crazed bargain hunters started lining up @entity6 deals at commercial stores throughout the country as early as monday evening			1
adding to the mayhem : @entity48 winner @entity47 will be performing at the @entity7 on friday @entity50 shoppers in @entity51 have started pitching tents outside several store locations , more than 100 hours before the company ’s big holiday sale begins			1
shoppers in @entity57 are also getting an early start in line , equipped with soda , water , snacks , laptops and air mattresses			2
according to @entity67 , more and more retailers across the country will require big buyers to hand over their driver 's licenses so that the store can keep a record to place alongside your purchase history			1
in doing so , they will be able to keep tabs on who makes multiple returns after the busy shopping day			2
if an individual abuses the system , they may have their right to return unwanted goods taken away for future purchases			0
the flood of bargain hunters could mean an even bigger headache for holiday workers this year			0
retail employees recently began protesting the earlier shifts they were given this @entity6 as several chain stores have decided to open earlier than previous years			1
@entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity92 are all opening their doors between 8 and 9pm this @entity97 , two to four hours earlier than last year			0
they 're here : shoppers flood a @entity50 store in @entity101 , @entity102 that opened at midnight on november 25 2011 crazed consumers : shoppers vie for copies of video games at a @entity6 sale at a @entity94 store in @entity109 , @entity110 in 2011 that news led to the organization of a national @entity6 walkout among @entity94 workers and more than 40 petitions on @entity116 protesting this year 's @entity97 shifts at several big chain retailers			1
adding to the mayhem of hundreds of thousands of people expected at the @entity7 , they are following in the footsteps of other retailers who are doing what they can to draw the ready - to - spend crowds on friday			2
the @entity125 reports that @entity48 winner @entity47 will be performing inside the @entity7 , which is the second - largest in the country in terms of space throughout the entire @entity129			1
part of the problem was that the @entity7 , which typically welcomes more than 40 million people per year , became a hotspot for teenagers to see and be seen , as opposed to simply going through their @entity136 shopping list			0
early shoppers : shoppers camp outside of a @entity50 store in @entity140 , @entity141 ' last year we experienced a large influx of youth , more than we had anticipated , ' spokesman @entity142 told the @entity146			1
' we do n't want it to turn into a place for people to come and hang out			0
' administrators are hoping that the adult guidance policy is good on all fronts			0
' retailers love the policy			0
when we first implemented it , there were concerns that sales would drop			0
but sales increased following the implementation and remain strong			0
