rev. @entity10 , center , arrives for a meeting of the @entity5 of the @entity5 on wednesday			2
he was suspended and defrocked in 2013 for officiating at his son 's wedding to another man the @entity5 , with more than 12 million members worldwide , has been debating its policy on same - sex relationships for four decades , but recently frustration with the current policy has fueled a movement to openly defy church law			1

' that second punishment was wrongfully imposed for a possible future violation			0
