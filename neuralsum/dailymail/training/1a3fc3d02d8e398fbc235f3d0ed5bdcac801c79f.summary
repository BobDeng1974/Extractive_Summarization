conundrum : a @entity1 , @entity2 , woman claims that the city 's new parking meters are causing her to have ear infections and tightness in her neck - so she wants the city to pay her billions for the inconvenience ' i know it seems a little big , ' said @entity31 , a well - known local activist , to the @entity32			1
' but they ca n’t do things that affect people ’s health without their consent			2
i think that ’s wrong			2
' she says the city began rolling out the new meters in april and her problems started shortly thereafter			1
the smart meters use wireless signals to process credit cards and monitor when a car arrives or departs			1
a month after the devices were installed , @entity31 went to a doctor for an ear infection and needed antibiotics			0
@entity31 believes that the radiation emitted by the smart meters is harming her health			2
claim : @entity12 has demanded the city pay her $ 1.7billion for the damage done since the new meters were installed in april and $ 1.7million every month thereafter @entity31 was in a car accident as a child and suffered neurological damage			1
' i 'm sensitive to to radiation due to cat scans , some with injections of radioactive dye , as a child , ' she wrote in the claim , according to @entity70			0
in the wake of new technologies , new fears have arisen			0
some people believe the radiation emitted from every day devices can cause illnesses in people with @entity79 , or @entity80 , though no studies have ever been conclusive			0
below are some common symptoms and causes identified by the sufferers of @entity80			0
symptoms : headaches , migraines , insomnia , @entity89 , @entity91 's , irritability , behavior disorders , autism , nerve and / or muscle pain , @entity96 , @entity97 ( @entity97 ) or @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , lupus , leukemia , tumors , cancer , heart attacks causes : cell phones , microwave or cell phone towers , radar , satellite , infrared , ultrasonic devices , @entity20 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity113 tags , computers , power lines , and other electrical equipment the @entity117 recently conducted a study that defined @entity119 as follows : @entity119 is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual			1
the symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity			0
whatever its cause , @entity119 can be a disabling problem for the affected individual			0
@entity119 has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link @entity119 symptoms to @entity80 exposure			0
she cites a study by the @entity117 that low - level radiation might cause cancer and other illnesses as the origin of her concern			1
' this is just blatant negligence , ' she said			0
' the city did n't do enough research			2
' some experts have dismissed her claims as ' frivolous @entity149 ’s @entity148 , @entity150 , said that @entity31 's argument will be difficult , if not impossible to prove			2
' anything is possible , but the risk has never been proven — ever , ' he said			0
@entity154 , a @entity155 - based attorney who specializes in radiation litigation , echoed mr @entity150			2
' radio waves are not known to have any effect on people at any level , ' he said , calling @entity31 ' a nut case			1
' similarly , @entity162 is not interested in her plight			0
' we ’re not concerned about any health risks , ' assistant finance director @entity165 told @entity168			0
' it basically uses a very weak @entity20 signal that only communicates between the meter and the sensor in each space			1
' he called the technology ' off - the - shelf ' and noted that the city does n't regulate communication			1
' what we ’re using is what basically is widely available cell phone technology , ' @entity165 said			0
' if you have @entity20 in your house , it ’s the same technology			2
if you have a cell phone , then that portion of the technology is the same			0
' the city has 45 days to respond to her claim , which is the largest settlement sum sought in @entity1 's history .			1

@entity12 claims @entity20 signals from parking meters give her infections
is demanding @entity1 pay her billions in settlement
city denies low - level waves cause any harm
