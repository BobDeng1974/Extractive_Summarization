by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity3 communications director @entity2 has confirmed that plans for a new under - 21 tournament including clubs from around @entity7 are underway			1
@entity8 revealed on tuesday that a new cup competition made up of 16 teams from @entity11 and abroad is set to run parallel to the revamped domestic under 21 league			1
and @entity2 , who insists the tournament is not a rival to @entity16 's plans for a b league made up partly of @entity3 reserve sides , has confirmed that there is plenty of support for the concept			1
test : @entity25 's under 21 side will face @entity7 opposition in the @entity3 's new youth competition @entity11 : @entity25 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34			1
@entity7 : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 he told @entity44 : ' we do believe it would be good for the development of talented young players but it is not an answer to the b league proposal at all			2
it is something we have wanted to do for a number of years			0
' we are keen to work with @entity53 on what we think is a good development opportunity and there has been a lot of support from clubs on the continent			0
' our view is that an under - 21 competition with a significant programme of international fixtures at lower age levels is a good opportunity to expose players to this level of competition			1
we now need to work with @entity53 for their agreement			0
' the initiative is all part of the @entity73 introduced in 2011 to improve the standard of young players the top @entity11 clubs are producing			2
triumph : @entity25 youngster @entity78 celebrates the winner in the final against @entity31 in may @entity81 , who finished runners - up in last season ’s under 21 development league , have not taken up the opportunity , giving @entity34 , who finished ninth , the chance to step in			1
the competition will run parallel to the under 21 league			2
that now carries the added interest of promotion and relegation and will see both @entity96 and @entity97 televise 10 matches live			0
the organisers are hopeful matches will attract good crowds and it is expected clubs will field their best young players just below first - team level			0
@entity39 academy director @entity105 helped produce four of @entity108 ’s @entity107 winning squad and is one of @entity7 ’s most respected authorities on youth football			2
he jumped at the chance to enter his under 21 side			0
‘ this is a fantastic new initiative and the @entity3 have been very good in setting it up , ’ he told @entity8			2
‘ you need to expose your players to different types of football and different countries in front of foreign crowds			0
’ another chance : @entity31 's youngsters are set to take part in the new tournament teams will be allowed to field three players over the age of 21			1
the format comprises four groups of four with the winners and runners - up advancing to the quarter - finals			0
all knockout games will be played over two legs and it is hoped the clubs ’ main stadiums will be used for matches			0
the competition is designed to expose prospects to foreign opposition and take them away from the staid , behind - closed - doors environment of domestic youth football which has been criticised in recent years			1
there will , however , be no commercial opportunities during the inaugural season of the @entity3 's new @entity7 cup and they are keen for it to be seen as a development opportunity ; no prize money will be awarded to the winners , for example			1
meanwhile , the name of the competition is yet to be decided , as is the venue for the final .			0

@entity3 is set to unveil new @entity7 cup competition this season
tournament will see @entity11 under - 21 sides take on @entity7 opposition
@entity31 , @entity30 and @entity25 among those involved
