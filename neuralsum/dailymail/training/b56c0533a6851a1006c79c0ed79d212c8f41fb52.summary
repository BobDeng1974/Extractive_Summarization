by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:06 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 25 november 2013 congressional staffers are readying a tough new round of sanctions against @entity5 , just days after president @entity6 and secretary of state @entity7 announced a deal that would significantly ease economic penalties against the @entity11 republic in exchange for modest limits on its nuclear enrichment program			1
legislative aides to @entity16 and @entity18 @entity17 told @entity19 that there 's a consensus on @entity22 that the @entity23 has bent too far in @entity25 's direction			1
and their bosses have asked for a slate of legislative options by the end of the brief @entity31 recess			0
' somebody has to make sure the @entity35 does n’t explode , ' an adviser to a senior @entity16 @entity33 said monday morning , ' and no one else seems to have their eye on the ball			0
' but this is n't your usual " us versus them " deal , ' the aide said			2
' senior democrats will see this draft too			0
and i 'm betting it would be the only one making the rounds by the end of the week			0
' some republicans on the @entity16 side of the @entity84 are also spoiling for a fight over the @entity6 administration 's surprising pact with @entity5 president @entity42			1
is the devil in the details ? @entity91 @entity17 sen. @entity51 said sunday that ' [ t ] here is now an even more urgent need for @entity44 to increase sanctions ' despite the @entity18 's posture , ' until @entity5 completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities			1
' @entity59 chairman @entity58 , a @entity98 @entity33 , has so far limited his comments to an endorsement of what another @entity18 aide told @entity19 is ' the weakest plan on the table , ' one that would include a six - month trigger to give @entity5 ample time to keep – or break – its promises under its deal with the @entity1 and other world powers			1
' i expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the @entity16 will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on @entity5 , ' @entity58 said sunday			1
president @entity6 echoed this line in his speech saturday night			2
' if @entity5 does not fully meet its commitments during this six - month phase , we will turn off the [ sanctions ] relief and ratchet up the pressure , ' he said			1
but this approach wo n't meet with approval from many @entity125 who are just as eager to force @entity6 into a veto showdown as they are to demonstrate a tough - on - @entity5 posture going into the 2014 election season			1
an anti-iran video caught online fire over the weekend , depicting the @entity134 's regime as virulently anti-american and hinting that @entity6 's deal with @entity42 is a foolish one not impressed : @entity138 's prime minister @entity137 denounced the nuclear agreement with @entity5 as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within @entity25 's reach @entity145 @entity144 sen. @entity144 captured @entity22 's fears about the @entity5 nuclear deal , worrying that a huge carrot will help @entity5 ignore a tiny stick			1
' we had a chance to deliver a body blow , ' he said ' we 're going to be the stick in the mud , ' predicted the second @entity17 staffer , who works for a @entity18 @entity17 on the @entity156			1
' the president has committed us to a dangerous course of action , i think , and we 're setting ourselves up to lose @entity138 as an ally			0
lots of members here will be happy to paint @entity6 into a corner and make him veto tougher sanctions that what he just let @entity42 weasel out of			2
' peace for our time ? @entity1 secretary of state @entity7 ( r ) shakes hands with @entity5 foreign minister @entity172 ( @entity173 ) at the @entity174 in @entity175 november 24 , 2013 ' and none of this six - month - grace - period nonsense , ' he added			1
' let 's do it now			0
' global reactions have been muted , with most world leaders expressing tepid support			0
@entity184 foreign minister @entity183 said his country ' has consistently called on @entity5 to exercise flexibility on the matter			2
we want to keep a close watch in a way to help implement this agreement			0
' @entity194 @entity193 spokesman @entity192 said his nation ' welcomes the prospect of resolving questions related to @entity5 's nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy			2
' closer to the @entity35 region , reactions were more strident			0
@entity205 ' considers it to be a historic accord which guarantees the interests of the brotherly @entity5 people , ' the @entity11 regime 's foreign office said			2
@entity138 's prime minister @entity137 said sunday that ' [ w ] hat was achieved yesterday in @entity175 is not a historic agreement but rather a historic mistake			0
' added pressure on @entity1 lawmakers is coming from a @entity217 video that has been seen by more than 1.1 million people since friday			0
titled simply ' @entity219 , ' the anonymously authored video contains a laundry list of anti-american statements from @entity5 leaders , read over a series of editorial cartoon - style drawings and a soundtrack full of riotous crowd noises			2
during his recent presidential campaign , according to the video 's narrator , @entity42 said that ' saying " @entity232 " is easy ; we need to express " @entity232 " with action			0
' speaking exclusively to @entity19 , the video 's creator – who requested anonymity – said that @entity1 ' need to know the @entity5 threat is not focused on @entity138			0
' ' imagine if @entity138 did not exist , ' he said			0
' then imagine what we would be thinking about " @entity232 " [ statements ' from people who commit suicide on a regular basis and have a deliverable nuclear weapon			0
' @entity18 majority leader @entity250 called the deal ' dangerous ' on monday morning , noting that it fell short of the recommendations of the @entity255 @entity254 appearing sunday on @entity258 's ' @entity257 ' program , secretary of state @entity7 would n't respond directly to a question about whether the president would veto any new @entity5 sanctions @entity44 might pass			1
' i believe @entity44 will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal of benefit in it , and i look forward to going up and working with our colleagues on the hill in order to try to persuade them that this is not the moment to increase sanctions , ' @entity7 said			0
@entity7 met with @entity275 foreign secretary @entity274 on sunday after taking part in the breakthrough talks that are temporarily curbing @entity5 's nuclear activity several democrats in the @entity16 , where @entity7 served before joining the @entity6 administration , have already expressed dismay at what they see as a lopsided deal between the @entity18 and @entity42			1
' this disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that @entity16 and @entity17 will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in december , ' @entity286 @entity285 sen. @entity284 said sunday in a statement			1
@entity17 sen. @entity144 said monday on @entity292 that ' we had a chance to deliver a body blow , ' against @entity5 , since ' the sanctions [ already in place ] actually worked			1
' ' but this interim deal gives the @entity5 $ 7 billion in cash , ' he complained , ' and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around			2
' house speaker @entity302 hinted on sunday that @entity1 must maintain as much pressure on @entity25 as the @entity18 will allow			0
otherwise , @entity302 said , ' we will look back on the interim deal as a remarkably clever @entity5 move to dismantle the international sanctions regime while maintaining its infrastructure and material to pursue a break - out nuclear capability			1

legislators are readying bills that would force @entity6 to choose between backing off from his @entity5 deal and vetoing tough new sanctions
' we 're going to be the stick in the mud , ' says one @entity18 @entity17 aide
lopsided deal ' makes it more likely that @entity285 and @entity17 will join together and pass additional sanctions , ' predicts *liberal* @entity284
@entity6 and sen. @entity58 are holding firm on a six - month grace period for the @entity42 regime , but @entity22 is *rumbling* with *discontent*
