a photographer has created a wonderfully unique family album by recreating a series of portraits of seven different generations of her female relatives			1
@entity8 - based photoshop expert @entity7 used a series of detailed editing techniques in order to create perfect copies of the original images , which all feature members of her mother 's family and were taken over a period of 200 years			1
the 33 - year - old then displayed the two images alongside each other , so as to demonstrate her remarkable resemblance to each of the original subjects			1
fast forward to one of the more recent photos of @entity25 , born in 1957 , and the glaring changes in style are easy to see			2
gone are the drab and dowdy clothes of old and in their place , a vibrant and detailed red dress , big , bouncy hairstyle and over-the - top gold jewelry			2
the beauty trends for each era are also clearly visible , with @entity31 , born in 1928 , modeling a deep red lip and full hair , while @entity65 , born 1898 , opted for a much more subtle look , complete with softly styled hair			0
eager to include herself in the line - up , ms @entity7 also included a single portrait of herself in the collection , dolled up in the style of her birth year , 1981			1
@entity75 , born 1821 : the images have earned ms @entity7 ( r ) high praise from her fellow @entity79 users , with many praising her incredible editing skills @entity7 , born 1981 : the photographer also included an image of herself , taken in the style of her own year of birth @entity65 , born 1898 : each of ms @entity7 's own portraits are showcased alongside the original so as to best demonstrate her resemblance to her relatives and clearly unable to resist the chance to include a humorous element in the project , the last collection in the portrait sees ms @entity7 attempt to impersonate a horse called @entity95			1
the portrait , in which the photographer poses in a checked shirt , complete with straw in her mouth , is the final picture in the series , which has thus far proved incredibly popular with fans			1
' fantastic series ! proves you can actually replicate any era , or indeed creature , ' @entity79 user @entity105 commented on the images			0
' this is a hoot ! love it			0
you come from a family of pretty women - and one mare , ' @entity113 added			1
it is not the first time that ms @entity7 's unique editing skills have earned her praise			0
@entity122 , born 1858 : everything from the hairstyles to the clothing was carefully recreated @entity126 , 2015 : ms @entity7 could n't help but include one humorous image in july , the photographer became an overnight social media sensation after posting a series of images on @entity132 which combined traditional 1950s female stereotypes with classic cult horror movies			2
at the time , she told @entity135 that her work was inspired by her love of the different time periods , and the unique cultural phenomenons from within each era			0
' i ’m very enamored with the style of the 1940s , ’ 50s , and ’ 60s , ' she said			0
' but i love the goofy sense of comedy that came out of the 1980s			0
' so my work is kind of a pretty / spooky combination of those things			0

@entity150 , 33 , used @entity151 in order to perfectly copy the style of each picture
