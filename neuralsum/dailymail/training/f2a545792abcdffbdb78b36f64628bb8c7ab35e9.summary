sentencing judge @entity52 said the only appropriate sentence was a return to prison			2
he added : ' the fact you were in an open prison when you decided to walk out must have meant you were relatively trusted			0
' it may have been that you would have achieved release on licence at some point thereafter			0
' i am told that , after your escape , you returned to the @entity48 where you remained until your arrest by police			2
' any escape is serious and if the person concerned is serving a sentence of life imprisonment it creates alarm and fear amongst the general public			1
' murder victim : @entity75 , left , with his younger brother @entity76			0
@entity0 and his girlfriend attacked @entity75 with a wrench , hammer and knife before writing ' @entity81 ' on the wall with his blood the judge said , that as a result of his escape , @entity25 was now being held in a more secure prison and the prospect of his release had been severely jeopardised			1
he added : ' the sentence i have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you			2
' that is a matter for the parole board			0
' the court heard it was not immediately clear how @entity25 was able to claim benefits despite his status as a wanted man			1
prosecuting @entity102 said : ' he must have been deemed to be a dangerous offender because he was not subject to release until the parole board deemed it safe to do so			0
convicted killer @entity0 was allowed to ' simply walk out ' of @entity12 before going on the run for nine years while managing to claim benefits and take holidays abroad , a court heard ' @entity12 is a category d prison and he simply walked out of the grounds			1
' @entity112 , defending , said his client , who appeared in court on crutches , walked out of @entity12 in frustration at waiting so long to be released			0
he said : ' he went to @entity32 and then moved back to @entity47 where initially he was caring for his parents			2
' they were in ill health but subsequently it has been him who has been unwell			0
' the dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today			0
' @entity25 was jailed for life 30 years ago for the drug - fuelled murder of 16 - year - old @entity75 at his flat in west @entity129			1
he attacked the teenager with a knife , hammer and wrench - leaving him with 56 injuries before writing ' @entity1 ' on the wall in his blood			1
@entity25 was sentenced to at least 16 years , but was deemed so dangerous that he was still in @entity12 , near @entity137 , @entity13 , in 2005 - 21 years later			1
after his latest arrest his parents @entity138 and @entity25 said they thought their son had been freed and were shocked to find out he was a wanted fugitive			1
speaking from their Â£ 200,000 semi-detached house in @entity47 , mrs @entity25 , 79 , said : ' he rang me from a landline on my mobile phone just after 3 o'clock in the afternoon and just said to me ' mum , please do n't worry but i 'm in a police station			1
' ' he said " i 've been set up			0
i 've been arrested on suspicion of absconding from prison "			0
he did n't say which police station he was in but told me not to worry			0
' i was so shocked i broke down in tears at the kitchen table and it took me an hour to tell my husband what had happened			0
as far as we were concerned , and @entity0 was concerned for that matter , he was a free man			2
' he never hid from anyone and was even claiming disability benefits			1
he 's got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a walking stick			0
' he ca n't work but he 's so helpful to everyone and he 's just a lovely , kind man			0
its ridiculous that he has been arrested after so much time			0
' he walked out of the open prison because he could n't handle the stress and bullying he was going through			0
' he only had a few months left to serve and we just thought he was free because no one came for him from the police			0
he gave our address for his mail and rented a flat nearby from a well to do couple			0
' he never told them about his past because that 's where it was , in the past and he was making a new life for himself			0
' i do n't think @entity0 even knew he was in trouble because he 's been claiming benefits and even called the police when he thought someone was throwing stones at his windows			1
' he 's had a passport for heavens sake and travelled to @entity32 so he 's not exactly been lying low			2
' the police and the authorities have had plenty of chances to catch up with him and it seems very unfair to do so now when he 's been leading a law - abiding life for nine years			1
' the people around here do n't know about what happened ( @entity0 's crimes ) and i do n't know how i will face them if people find out			2
' @entity0 could n't work			2
he was disabled and claimed benefits and his benefits paid his rent for him			2

@entity207 should have been triggered in 2005 after @entity0 absconded
53 - year - old had been serving a life - sentence after being jailed in 1984
he had hacked a teenager to death and used his blood to write on a wall
but police refused to launch a search and only *recorded* him missing

he was even jailed in @entity32 , but no - one realised he was wanted in @entity225
