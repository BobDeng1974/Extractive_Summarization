by @entity0 published : 09:41 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 2 january 2013 babies have the capacity to learn and remember sounds of language from their mother during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy babies start to learn language before they are even born , scientists have discovered			1
previously , it was believed that newborns begin to discriminate between language sounds within their first months of life			1
but a new study indicates that babies have the capacity to learn and remember elementary sounds of their language from their mother during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy			2
' we have known for over 30 years that we begin learning prenatally about voices by listening to the sound of our mother talking , ' said @entity24 , a professor of psychology at @entity26 , who led the research			0
' [ but ] this is the first study that shows we learn about the particular speech sounds of our mother 's language before we are born			2
' forty girls and boys , about 30 - hours - old , were studied in @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity37			0
the babies heard either @entity40 or @entity41 vowels and they could control how many times they heard the vowels by sucking on a dummy connected to a computer			1
vowel sounds were chosen for the study because they are prominent , and the researchers thought they might be noticeable in the mother ’s ongoing speech , even against the noisy background sounds of the womb			1
in both countries , the babies at birth sucked longer for the foreign language than they did for their native tongue , regardless of how much postnatal experience they had			0
early learning : new research has is indicated that babies learn vowel sounds in utero this indicated to researchers that they were learning the vowel sounds in utero			1
@entity67 , co-author and co-director of the @entity69 at the @entity70 , added : ' we thought infants were ' born learning ' but now we know they learn even earlier			2
they are not phonetically naïve at birth			0
' we want to know what magic they put to work in early childhood that adults can not			0
' we ca n't waste that early curiosity			0
the mother has first dibs on influencing the child 's brain			0
' the vowel sounds in her speech are the loudest units and the fetus locks onto them			1

it was previously thought they began *picking* up words in the first few months of life
but new research shows infants start to discriminate between vowel sounds before they are born
babies tested acknowledged *difference* between @entity40 and @entity41
