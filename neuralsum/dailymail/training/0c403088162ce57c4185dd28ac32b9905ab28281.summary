@entity0 believes he could have earned more money by switching clubs this summer but leaving @entity3 for nothing ‘ would not have sat right ’ with him			1
the @entity6 midfielder admitted the prospect of moving to a team challenging for @entity9 had been tempting but insisted the pull of becoming a @entity3 hero swung the balance			1
he conceded his decision had shocked team - mates but argued he can make @entity17 ’s @entity16 squad playing regularly under @entity18			1
@entity0 surprised many by penning a four - and - a - half - year deal worth £ 55,000 per week despite interest from @entity35 and @entity36 , who he could have joined on a free this summer once his previous deal ran out			1
‘ i feel like i ’ve been treated really good by the club			1
it would n’t have sat right with me leaving , especially on a free , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ being on a free means financially i would have been better off			2
but i ’m a kid from @entity42 , brought up on a council estate			2
i am not money - driven			1
‘ i live a simple life			2
i love my family , and take care of them			2
if i can play week in , week out and feel like i ’m still developing , i ’m happy			1
‘ the lads are absolutely delighted			2
as soon as i told some of them they looked at me shocked to start with			2
most people in my situation would be looking to move on			2
‘ they know what type of guy i am – i ’m quite driven			2
they expected me to try to challenge for something that others clubs are challenging for			0
it would have been exciting			0
@entity0 , pictured against @entity58 , earned his first @entity6 cap in september whilst playing for @entity3 ‘ but i got into the @entity6 side by playing here and i ’m sure i can stay in the @entity6 squad playing here			1
‘ i ’ve got a lot of time for people at this club , even the cleaners			0
i love my team - mates			1
i see them as brothers			0
i ’d run through a brick wall for them			0
‘ the chairman has been great			0
as a young boy , injured , for the guy who has invested money in me to call me saying , “ do n’t worry you ’ll come out the other end ” , you can imagine what that meant to me			0
’ @entity0 instructed his agent not to come to him with offers from clubs this month			1
‘ if i made the decision to leave @entity3 when i was out of contract , then conversations can start			1
until then , there was no way i was going to be speaking to anybody			0
i told my agent to leave me alone as i want to focus on my football and getting myself fit			0
’ @entity0 did not elaborate on whether his contract contained a release clause			1
‘ i ’m happy here and wanting to push on , ’ he said			1
‘ if somebody did come in the future , put a bid in and it was right for the club i ’m sure people would have a look at it			0
i ’m here to stick it out			0
’ that includes providing @entity3 supporters with more to cheer than in recent years			1
an @entity109 run would help			0
‘ it would be absolutely terrific for the fans			0
i ’ve been fighting relegation for three years			0
