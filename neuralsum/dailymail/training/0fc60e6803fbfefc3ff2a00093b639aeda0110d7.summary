conservative activists let it all hang out in a noontime tea party protest outside the @entity5 headquarters building in @entity6 on tuesday			1
about 70 protesters held signs , chanted slogans , and listened to speakers rail against what they called ' their ' unconstitutional ' treatment at the hands of the federal government 's tax authorities			2
' big government is the problem , ' @entity18 @entity17 founder @entity16 told @entity21			0
' they 're going to have to produce all the documents showing who ordered this persecution of tea party groups , when it happened , and how much president @entity28 knew about it			1
' @entity16 's group organized the rally , one of dozens held around the country , to highlight what she called the federal government 's ' harassment and intimidation			2
' the largest protest , attracting a reported 250 activists , was in @entity41 , the home of the @entity5 office that evaluates and approves applications for nonprofit tax - exempt status			1
that office , the @entity5 has conceded , unfairly targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny based on their names and political positions			1
protesters carried hand - made signs with political messages on tuesday , including one that would n't be family friendly if it were spelled out tea party activists said they held president @entity28 responsible for the ' abuses ' his tax collectors inflicted on conservative groups because of the political beliefs of their members in @entity6 , organizers led chants of ' big government ! big problem ! ' @entity66 , president of the @entity67 , told the crowd through an electric bullhorn that ' if you leave here with no other message , it 's that government has no rights			1
' ' people have rights , ' he said			0
and when those powers are abused , the people will ultimately take them back			0
' a trio of elderly @entity84 joined in the protest			0
@entity86 ( c ) is 93 years old			0
@entity87 ( @entity88 ) , from @entity89 , said , ' i 'm in full support of freedom of speech			0
we do this all the time in @entity95 ' one activist , who would not give his name , wore a ' mask of intimidation and fear ' to protest the @entity5 for using an extra layer of surveillance to evaluate conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status			1
the back of his mask read , ' do n't audit me , @entity107 ' ! ! ' and ' tyranny is a drag ' @entity66 told @entity21 after the 45 - minute protest that he doubts president @entity28 's claim that he knew nothing about the @entity5 harassing tea party groups until an inspector general report was leaked to media outlets on may 10			1
' no , ' he said			0
and i find it fascinating how they 're trying to spin this so the president is n't to blame			1
' ' we have to find out who gave the order to persecute the tea party , but the fish always stinks from the head			1
' ' if not @entity28 , then who ? ' he asked			2
' if the @entity130 is honest , @entity28 is either complicit or ignorant			2
i think they may be keeping him out of the loop - for a reason			0
' a tea party supporter dressed in @entity138 garb displayed a historical ' appeal to @entity141 ' flag outside the @entity5 headquarters			1
the flag design dates to 1775 and was flown on ships commissioned by @entity145			0
@entity146 wrote in his @entity147 that after men have exhausted all avenues of seeking justice , an " appeal to heaven ' is the option of last resort @entity156 police protected the @entity5 headquarters building on tuesday as tea party protesters gathered for their protest , one of many held throughout the @entity161 asked about the president 's chief spokesman at the @entity130 , @entity66 said , ' i think @entity165 is a useful dupe			1
' @entity167 , a demonstrator from @entity168 , @entity169 , carried a sign reading , ' do n't target me , @entity107 ' he said he is skeptical that @entity28 was n't aware of the abuses going on inside hie @entity172 until he saw a televised news report			2
' this is too convenient , ' @entity167 told @entity21			0
' i 'm wondering if he gets all his news about his own government from tv			0
every time something big comes up , he 's learning about it on @entity181 or @entity182			0
' ' is n't he supposed to know things ? ' @entity16 , the event 's chief organizer , stopped short of calling for more @entity5 firings in addition to acting commissioner @entity187 , who will step down just weeks ahead of his appointment 's scheduled ending date			1
' the problem , no matter who is in these jobs , ' she said , ' is big government			0
' one tea party protester wore a ' free healthcare ' t - shirt whose fine print read '' not counting higher taxes , @entity201 spending cuts , the repurchase of @entity203 , a new airport in @entity205 and 2000 more pages of goodies			1
the message is a reference to pork - barrel spending and tax hikes that conservatives say is part of the president @entity28 's @entity214 @entity215 ( @entity88 ) and @entity16 ( c ) , addressed the crowd , saying that the growth of the federal government makes the @entity5 a likely place for abuses colorful characters were the norm on tuesday , as were signs lambasting president @entity28			1
@entity167 ( r ) mocked the president for finding out about his own administration by watching television news programs but @entity66 and others specifically mentioned @entity229 , the former chief of the @entity5 ' tax - exempt division who is now in charge of the agency 's office tasked with implementing new taxes under the @entity214			1
' the idea that she has not been fired , ' @entity66 said , ' is an indication of her importance to the administration and its twin goals : to destroy this movement and to implement @entity214			2
' @entity242 the former vice president of @entity244 who now leads his own group , @entity245 , told @entity21 that ' dozens of people should be fired ' at the @entity5 ' because they were complicit			2
i think almost all these people have to go			0
' but ' at the same time , ' he conceded , ' you could replace everyone at the @entity5 and they would still have the power to do this			2
what we should really do is limit their power to begin with			0
' @entity242 also noted the large cash bonuses that were paid to @entity258 in recent years , totaling more than $ 100,000			0
' someone needs to ask president @entity28 if he personally signed off on @entity229 's bonuses , ' he said			1
the federal government 's @entity261 , he said , requires president approval of all staff bonuses greater than $ 25,000			0
serious messages : tea party activists carried stern warnings to the @entity5 after the agency targeted their groups for special treatment based on their political philosophies a trio of elderly ladies including a 93 - year - old visiting @entity6 from @entity89 , @entity95 , told @entity21 that they supported the tea party , and would have brought flags to wave if they had known no one would be there to hand them out			1
spotting the police presence on the scene , including a cadre of officers from the @entity156 , a woman from @entity286 who identified herself as ' @entity287 ' said she was surprised to see the government 's police out in force			1
' the gray - haired old ladies must look really frightening , ' she said with thick sarcasm			0
' how dare they exercise their freedom of speech			0
' about 70 tea partiers gathered in @entity6 as their counterparts in other cities descended on federal buildings in protest			2
