by @entity0 the @entity3 is too secretive and has stopped official investigators from probing its huge pay deals and it fiascos , the head of the government spending watchdog said yesterday			2

the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) blamed @entity3 ' gatekeepers ' for stopping it from viewing key documents about financial scandals , delaying one crucial report by eight months			1
pictured is @entity3 @entity20 he said it can be so hard to extract information from the corporation that he has trouble keeping his staff ’s morale up			0
giving evidence to the @entity30 , he said : ‘ it is possible , particularly in difficult areas , to find the @entity3 does n’t provide evidence where in their judgment it is covered by commercial or confidentiality grounds , or indeed privacy grounds			0
‘ there are an excessive number of gatekeepers in the organisation who feel they can apply their judgment rather than relying on our professionalism with regards to what we might see			0
’ the chair of the @entity30 , @entity49 mp @entity48 , agreed with his criticism : ‘ there is a perception that the @entity3 is an enormously bloated , bureaucratic organisation , with more people carrying out a function than would be the case in any of the equivalent commercial broadcasters			0
’ the watchdog 's director , sir @entity12 , called for statutory powers to force @entity3 bosses to hand over evidence about how it uses its annual £ 3.5billion licence fee revenue last year , the @entity7 published two damning reports exposing @entity3 waste			1
the first found it blew £ 100million on a failed it project known as the @entity65			1
the second , which revealed that the corporation handed out £ 369million in severance pay - offs to its staff over eight years prompted parliamentary enquiries			0
but sir @entity12 revealed the @entity65 report was delayed by eight months because the @entity3 blocked access to key documents			1
and he said there are further delays because the @entity3 controls when his findings are published			0
he added : it can be difficult to keep motivation of my people going … when they have to wait a long time for information and it holds the report up			0
’ the @entity7 can probe the financial efficiency of all government departments and agencies , as well as police and the @entity90 , and has legal powers to force them to reveal documents			2
however , the @entity3 only provides access ‘ by agreement ’ , meaning it is able to block investigators			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' we welcome sir @entity12 ' positive comments about the management and governance of the @entity3 , our work on reducing costs and targets we 've achieved			1
' we are committed to openness and transparency as the content of previous @entity7 reports has shown and we have a good working relationship with the @entity7 which already has full access to the @entity3 's operations , with the exception of editorial areas , as protecting the @entity3 ’s editorial independence is paramount			2
