by @entity0 published : 22:41 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 22:59 est , 3 november 2013 a doctor who was a young medical student in @entity2 on the day president @entity3 was shot has described the events that he had kept quiet about for 50 years			1
dr @entity5 , 84 , was a fourth year surgery student at @entity6 in @entity2 and so focused on his studies that the president being in town barely registered			1
' i do n't think i was hardly conscious of the fact that the president and his wife were going to be there , ' he told @entity15			2
moment in history : dr @entity17 rarely speaks about the events of november 22 , 1963 , even though he was present with president @entity3 was admitted to hospital after being shot in @entity2 emergency : crowds gathered outside @entity6 as @entity17 and his colleagues worked on president @entity3 and governor @entity25 it was n't until a flurry of limousines and motorcycles from the president 's motorcade screeched into the emergency entrance at @entity33 that the official visit became real			1
@entity17 had been quietly eating his lunch at 12:36pm when the speaker system called for the hospital 's chief of surgery , ' stat. ' another doctor told @entity17 to run with him to the emergency room because the president had been shot			1
unaware of the seriousness of the president 's injuries , @entity17 thrilled at the prospect of treating a president			1
motorcade : footage shows limos and motorbikes arriving at @entity33 's emergency entrance fifty years later : @entity6 , where president @entity3 was treated after being shot in @entity2 ' being a typical country boy , ' @entity5 told @entity15 ' i thought , " @entity58 , i 'm going to get to meet a president			1
" ' any thoughts of shaking the president 's hand were quickly forgotten when @entity17 entered the trauma ward and saw @entity3 's blood beginning to pool on the floor as doctors desperately tried to save his life			1
' i saw these people standing there , ' he told @entity15			0
@entity70 in scrubs : dr @entity17 has become a well - respected and much loved figure in his native @entity74 ' and i saw mrs. @entity75 seated by the door			1
and her clothing was stained			0
and i realized that this was not a good deal			0
' ' i right quick recognized that this was a fatal injury , ' @entity5 recalls			1
he knew that it was futile to attempt to aid the doctors who were working on the dying president			2
' i have no idea what i said , but they said , " well , there 's a guy across the hall needs some help , " ' he said			0
the young surgeon crossed the hall and found a man with a severe chest wound			2
' functioning in this kind of situation , i think we develop the ability to just get focused in on the problem , ' he told @entity15			0
' you do n't care who it is or what it is			0
you just try to identify the problem and do the things that need to be done to achieve your goal			0
; @entity17 began prepping the man for surgery , only dimly noticing that the man he was treating was governor @entity25			1
according to @entity15 , @entity17 had plans to take his wife to the opera on november 22 , 1963 , but they never made it			2
in fact , @entity17 did n't return home for several days , staying by @entity25 's bedside as the president 's state funeral took place , and @entity124 was shot			1
@entity5 's wife told him later that the couple 's then - three - year - old daughter said grace at the table before dinner			0
she said , ' the world is dark and we are very sad			0
' that a three - year - old could intuit the sombre mood surrounding the events and describe it so precisely shocks @entity17 to this day			1
but for the respected surgeon , the dark , sad day is one he prefers not to speak about , even 50 years later			2
fateful day : just hours after this photograph was taken , dr @entity17 received @entity3 into the emergency room and knew the president had been fatally injured moment of truth : young medical student dr @entity5 treated governor @entity25 when he first arrived at the hospital after being shot in the chest since those events , @entity17 has become a well - respected and much - loved @entity149 surgeon			1
he 's been referred to as ' @entity70 in scrubs , ' and ran a nationally - syndicated television spot called ' dr @entity17 's @entity152 ' for 15 years			2
he was also instrumental in introducing @entity149 's @entity154 medical transport service to @entity149 , @entity74			0
according to your @entity149 news , dr @entity5 still works 12 - hour days saving lives at the @entity158 in @entity149			0
to this day , @entity17 finds it difficult to believe his role in the day the nation stopped			1
for years , he did n't talk about it			0
and for all the years of medical practice , in an office cluttered with mementoes and souvenirs , he has nothing to commemorate that day			2
he does n't need anything to remember it by - the events of november 22 1963 are indelibly etched on his memory			0
' it 's so surreal that it does n't make sense			2
it 's like an out - of - body experience			0
but i was there , i did all that stuff , ' he said .			0

@entity182 ' @entity181 ' @entity17 was on duty when president @entity3 was admitted to @entity6 in @entity2
he helped save the life of governor @entity25 , who was shot in the chest
@entity17 says he knew as soon as he saw president @entity75 that he had sustained a fatal injury
he still finds it surreal that he was there that fateful day
