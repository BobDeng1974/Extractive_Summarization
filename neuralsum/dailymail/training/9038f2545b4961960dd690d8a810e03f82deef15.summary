by @entity0 with buttons , levers and flashing lights , this looks like a computer control room			1
it is , however , just the computer			1
the @entity8 weighs 2.5 tons , contains 10,000 moving parts and can work without a break for 80 hours a week			1
so what does it do ? it churns out lots of sums very quickly			0
in other words , it ’s a calculator			0
modern day computers work in less than a second when it was built in 1951 , this computer was a marvel of technology			1
yet only a couple of decades later , the same processing power was available in something a little smaller			0
pocket - sized , to be accurate			1
but for its time , the @entity8 was highly impressive			1
capable of calculating sums with great accuracy 24 hours a day , it was based at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , where it was used for mathematical modelling			0
a lecturer checks a punched tape for the 1950s witch			1
designed for reliability rather than speed , it could carry on relentlessly for days at a time delivering its error - free results @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 , a master at the @entity62 college ( right ) , in the 1960s checking a punched tape for the witch computer the computer has 828 flashing @entity8 valves , 480 relays and a bank of paper tape readers			1
it can now be seen by the public at @entity73 it was so advanced , it replaced a highly trained member of staff who had previously been number crunching on a clunking mechanical hand calculator			0
the @entity46 used dekatrons – gas - filled counting tubes containing ten cathodes – for memory , similar to the @entity83 in modern computers			1
paper tape was used for input and programme storage , and results were fed to a teleprinter or a paper tape punch			1
it was a highly industrious addition to the staff – averaging an 80 - hour week during one nine - month period from may 1952			2
it was later given to a college for training purposes before it was consigned to a museum and eventually dismantled and put into storage			2
the @entity46 is being switched on again today for the first time in a quarter of a century at the @entity73 at @entity99 in @entity100			0
and once powered up , it will become the oldest original functioning electronic stored programme computer in the world			1
the machine has been rebuilt by a team of volunteers led by museum trustee @entity107			2
‘ i first saw the @entity8 when i was a teenager in the 1970s , ’ he said			1
‘ it was on display in the @entity111 and i was very fond of it			0
‘ when that museum closed , it disappeared from public view			0
‘ but four years ago , quite by chance , i was looking at some photos of items in a storage centre and in the background i noticed the computer ’s control panel			1
’ the @entity46 , which was by then housed at @entity111 ’s @entity123 , had been dismantled into 50 pieces			2
but mr @entity107 was determined			0
he managed to locate around 99 per cent of the computer , which has 828 dekatron tubes , 480 relays , 199 lamps and three miles of wire			2
he and his volunteers spent three years reconstructing the machine , using original circuit diagrams and photos			2
the original designers were also tracked down for advice			0
‘ it is terrific to see it working again as i remember it so vividly from my teenage years and it is probably what inspired me to go into a career in computing , ’ said mr @entity107			0
‘ to see it in action is to watch the inner workings of a computer , something that is impossible on the machines of today			2
we hope it will now enthuse another generation of children			0
’ the computer was built and used at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , from components more commonly found in a @entity154 telephone exchange experts started building the machine in 1949 , and the computer was in use by april 1951 the computer was built and used at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , from components more commonly found in a @entity154 telephone exchange			1
experts started building the machine in 1949 , and it was in use by april 1951			2
it used dekatrons for volatile memory , similar to @entity83 in a modern computer , and paper tape for input and program storage			1
it was by no means a ' fast computer '			2
it had a multiplication time of between 5 and 10 seconds , very slow for an electronic computer , even at the time			0
but the design was noted for its reliability			0
in the period from may 1952 until february 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time			0
dr @entity181 , director of the @entity182 at @entity47 between 1948 and 1961 , said it ' could be left unattended for long periods			0
' ' i think the record was over one @entity188 holiday when it was all by itself , with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy , for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back			0
' so called ' hand computers ' or human workers who logged information by hand are recorded to have raced against the witch , but had to retire after half an hour , exhausted and defeated , while the computer ploughed on .			1

the 61 - year - old @entity8 ( aka witch ) computer , was made from parts more commonly found in a telephone exchange
the *mammoth* machine , which fills a room , is as heavy as @entity206 but computed at speeds even humans could keep pace with
once voted the world 's most durable computer , it was found broken up into 50 parts and gathering dust in storage
