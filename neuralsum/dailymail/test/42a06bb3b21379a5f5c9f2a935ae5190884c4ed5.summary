a monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the @entity2			2
primatologists working in @entity4 have captured the first ever picture of the @entity7 's red colobus monkey			1
their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct			0
researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it			0
a new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis			0
the white - cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south - east @entity29 after researchers set up camera traps			2
the monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area			2
officially named @entity38 , it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face			0
dr @entity44 , one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at @entity49 , @entity50 , in @entity51 , said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species			0
he said that due to the remoteness of the location in @entity57 of @entity29 , few biologists had been there			2
mr @entity14 said : ' our photos are the world 's first and confirm that the species is not extinct			0
' no one knows anything about them			0
they live in an area where scientists rarely go , along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area			2
' mr @entity14 spent three months , after setting off in february , searching the jungles of @entity2 in an attempt to find the @entity75 red colobus monkeys , or @entity76			1
together with his @entity78 colleagues , he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings			0
a group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the @entity88 in the @entity4			2
however , they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area			1
red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of @entity2 and are prized by hunters			1
the animals are also poor at recognising threats , often believing they are safe in the trees			0
rather than fleeing , red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees			1
the last unconfirmed sighting of a @entity7 's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the @entity109 and @entity110 rivers			1
in his attempt to rediscover the monkeys , mr @entity14 launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on @entity116			0
a video is shown above the @entity7 's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the @entity2 ( pictured above ) the only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago			1
in his attempt to rediscover the monkeys , mr @entity14 launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on @entity116			0
dr @entity125 , from the @entity126 , said : ' we ’re very pleased indeed that @entity14 and @entity16 were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that @entity7 ’s red colobus still exists , but also managing to get a very clear close - up picture of a mother and infant			1
' thankfully , many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging , agriculture , and roads , all of which can lead to increased hunting			1
' @entity144 , vice president for conservation strategy at the @entity126 , added : ' confirmation that @entity7 ’s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on @entity150 , and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late			1

@entity7 's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the @entity2 during 1970s
biologists have captured the first ever photographs of the rare primates
the monkeys live in noisy groups in the swampy forests alongside rivers
they are *feared* to be *threatened* by growing bushmeat trade in the area
