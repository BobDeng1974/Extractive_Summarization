families of victims of the 7/7 @entity3 bombings have slammed the @entity4 for a ' disgusting ' documentary that investigates conspiracy theories surrounding the atrocity			1
the programme , to be aired on @entity9 and hosted by @entity11 comedian @entity10 , probes claims that the co-ordinated blasts were in fact part of a @entity17 plot to boost support for the @entity20 war			1
the attacks killed 52 people when four suicide bombers detonated their home made devices on tubes and a bus during the morning rush - hour commute			1
' disgusting ' : programme makers even blow up a @entity3 bus in the documentary that explores the theory that the 7/7 bombings were in fact a government plot to garner support for the ' war on terror ' in tonight 's documentary show producers blow up a double - decker @entity3 bus in a bid to recreate the explosion in @entity43 that killed 13 people			1
it also features conspiracy theorists - including model @entity47 - playing the parts of the bombers in a reconstruction of events			1
@entity53 , whose daughter @entity54 , 24 , died in the underground blast near @entity56 told @entity57 : ' the @entity4 ca n’t get any lower than this			0
they should have spoken to the families			0
' branding the programme ' disgusting ' , she added : ' they are trivialising the tragedy			1
people do n’t want to be back in that dark place			2
it puts us through the pain all over again			0
' carnage : thirteen people were killed when a bomb detonated on board the @entity75 bus in @entity43 @entity76 , 54 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , who lost her son @entity79 , 22 , in the tube blast near @entity81 said it was in ' really bad taste ' , adding : ' how do they think we live with this ? ' a @entity4 spokeswoman said of 7/7 bombings : @entity89 : ' the series takes conspiracy theorists on a journey to fully explore the facts and challenge their beliefs			1
' between 8.50am and 9.47am on july 7 2005 , four @entity97 @entity96 - @entity95 , 30 , @entity98 , 22 , @entity99 , 19 , and @entity100 , 18 - blew themselves up using home - made explosives , killing 56 ( including themselves ) and injuring 700 on three tube trains and a double - decker bus			1
angry : @entity53 ( left , with husband john ) , whose daughter @entity54 , 24 , died in the blast near @entity56 branded the show ' disgusting '			0
it is hosted by @entity11 comedian @entity10 ( right ) they had travelled on a mainline train from @entity113 into @entity114 in @entity3 , each carrying a heavy rucksack of explosives			0
it is a timeline that has been endorsed by a high - level parliamentary inquiry and a government report , both published in may 2006 ten months after the event , based on 12,500 statements , a police examination of 142 computers and 6,000 hours of @entity124 footage			0
the report insisted that the bombers carried out the attacks on their own , constructing explosives from chapatti flour and hair bleach mixed in the bath at a flat in @entity136 , @entity137 , where all four had family and friends			0
however there have since been a wave of conspiracy theories around the attacks			0
one of the more popular accuses then prime minister @entity145 , the government , the police , and the @entity97 and @entity149 @entity148 of murdering the innocent people to stir up @entity152 fervour and create public support for the ' war on terror ' and looming war in @entity20			0
suicide bombers : four @entity97 @entity96 - @entity95 , 30 , @entity98 , 22 , @entity99 , 19 , and @entity100 , 18 - used home - made explosives to carry out the attacks it also alleges that the four @entity97 @entity96 were tricked by the authorities into taking part in what they were told would be a mock anti-terror training exercise			1
what they were n't told , it is claimed , was that the government was going to blow them up , along with other passengers , then pretend the four were suicide bombers			2
theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three tube trains and on the bus			2
the aftermath : theorists have also accused government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three tube trains and on the bus they suggest that the four @entity96 were not , in fact , on any of the tube trains , claiming that they missed them altogether because of the train delays on the @entity113 to @entity3 line			2
some even believe that because the four did not get onto the tube on time , three of them were murdered by police at @entity189 later that morning and the fourth - the bus bomber - ran off			2
an earlier version of this article carried a headline which said that the documentary suggested that the @entity17 had plotted the 7/7 attacks			0
we accept that this was seriously wrong : the true position was , as explained in the article , that the programme actually challenged the beliefs of the conspiracy theorists and did not suggest that the government was in any way responsible for the attacks			1
we apologise for the error .			0

the @entity9 documentary shows conspiracy theorists - including model @entity47 - play the bombers
producers blow up a bus in a bid to recreate the explosion in @entity43 that killed 13 people
parents of victims brand programme ' disgusting ' and in ' really bad taste '
