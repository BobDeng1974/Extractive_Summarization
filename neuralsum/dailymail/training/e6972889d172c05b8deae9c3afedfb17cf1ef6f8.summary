thousands of @entity1 are making little or no income tax contributions despite working full - time , a report claims today			1
the @entity4 ’s generous tax credits system means thousands of migrants without partners or children , who earn the minimum wage , pay just £ 1 - a - week net income tax , including @entity11			1
if they have a non-working partner and children , it costs the taxpayer money to support them , according to @entity18			1
the @entity4 's tax credits system means thousands of migrants without partners or children , who earn the minimum wage , pay just £ 1 - a - week net income tax , including @entity11 a singe earner couple with two children receives nearly £ 90 a week more in benefits than they pay in tax			1
with two children , the cost rises to £ 295			0
for three children it is £ 400 , four children £ 500 and five children £ 600 per week			0
the think - tank ’s analysis said a couple where both partners work on minimum wage would pay in a total £ 28 net			1
but if they have two children they could receive a net benefit of £ 380 a week			0
the group added that the calculations do not include indirect taxes such as vat nor do they include health , education and social services			0
there are also major costs in later life , for pensions and health , to which the low - paid will make no significant contribution			2
these could amount to £ 120,000 for a single pensioner and £ 160,000 for a couple			0
sir @entity57 said the taxpayer was ' subsidising ' the wages of many low paid migrants from the @entity61 , who have had access to the @entity4 jobs market since 2004			2
pictured are @entity66 economic migrants leaving for @entity4 that year according to official figures , around 25 per cent of @entity66 and other @entity1 are earning the minimum wage or less			1
only 4.5 per cent pay the higher 40p rate of tax , compared to 15 per cent of the @entity4 population as a whole			1
the tax credit system , largely engineered by @entity74 , tops up the wages of the lower paid			2
it benefits @entity4 workers in the exact same way as people from overseas			0
but @entity18 said that the figures blew a hole in claims that mass migration is good for the economy because of the taxes paid by foreign workers			2
chairman sir @entity57 said the taxpayer was ‘ subsidising ’ the wages of many low paid migrants from the @entity61 , who have had unrestricted access to the @entity4 ’s jobs market since 2004			2
he added : ‘ no wonder then that employers are in favour of them and that so many people find the @entity4 such an attractive destination			0
@entity18 said the figures blew a hole in claims that mass migration is good for the economy because of the taxes paid by foreign workers ‘ we constantly hear that immigrants work hard and pay their taxes			1
‘ there is no doubt that many of these people do work hard but it is a fact that those on the minimum wage pay virtually no direct taxes and , if in a couple , they can receive significant sums in tax credits and other benefits			1
‘ recent claims that @entity124 migrants make a “ very sizeable ” contribution to the @entity126 have simply not taken into account that the low incomes of so many mean that they receive much more in means - tested benefits than they pay in tax			1
’ last month , migration watch predicted immigration from the @entity124 will add an annual 130,000 to the @entity4 ’s population - equivalent of a new city the size of @entity132 to the @entity4 ’s population every four years			0
the total include 50,000 @entity135 and @entity136 and 40,000 people from @entity66 and the seven other @entity1 nations which joined the @entity124 in 2004			1
a single worker on the minimum wage in the @entity4 would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in @entity135 the remainder are expected to come from the so - called ‘ old ’ @entity124 - including large numbers from @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 fleeing the eurozone disaster			1
the campaign group said one of the major pull - factors to the @entity4 was the generous system of in - work benefits , such as tax credits			0
sir @entity57 said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in - work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here			2
under the current regime , a single worker on the minimum wage in the @entity4 would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in @entity135			1
for a family , this rises to nine times			0
any attempt to treat @entity124 migrants differently to @entity4 citizens , who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits , would spark a huge row with @entity171			2
the @entity172 is already dragging @entity173 to court over the so - called ‘ right to reside ’ test			0
earlier this month , statisticians admitted a “ substantial ” number of @entity1 migrants arriving in @entity4 in the last decade were not counted			2
net migration in the @entity4 between 2001 and 2011 was 346,000 higher than previously thought as a result of ' inadequate sampling ' of arrivals into the country , the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) said			0
an earlier version of this article reported claims from @entity18 that 150,000 eastern @entity1 migrants with no partners or children who are earning the minimum wage paid just £ 1 a week in net tax , including @entity11			1
in fact , other statistics in the report show that , of this number , childless couples will in fact pay more			0
all of the workers contribute to the exchequer through vat and other indirect taxes			0
we have now amended the article accordingly .			0

@entity18 says if migrants have a non-working partner and child it costs the taxpayer money to support them
around 25 per cent of @entity66 and @entity1 @entity214 earn minimum wage
only 4.5 per cent pay 40p tax rate , compared with 15 per cent of population
