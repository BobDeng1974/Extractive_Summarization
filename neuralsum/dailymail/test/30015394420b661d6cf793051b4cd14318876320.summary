a four - year - old boy got trapped in an arcade game after climbing in to the ' claw ' machine when he failed to win a teddy			1
@entity4 narrowly failed to pick up a @entity6 toy as he played the notoriously difficult claw game at his local swimming pool in @entity9 , @entity10			1
desperate to get to his hands on the teddy , he put his hand inside the machine 's hatch - but when he reached too far , he slipped under the trap door and was stuck inside			1
she alerted staff at the @entity19 leisure centre , but @entity4 was trapped for half an hour as workers looked for the key to the machine			1
mrs @entity34 , 33 , said : ' he asked if he could have a go on the teddy machine so i gave him Â£ 1 and told him to go with his big brother			1
' off they went round the corner and then his brother came back and said , " @entity4 is stuck in the machine			1
" i assumed he meant his hand - i did n't think he 'd be inside the machine			1
he was completely inside it ! ' he had picked the teddy up with the claw and it had dropped with the teddy 's leg hanging over the edge			1
struggle : it took workers half an hour to free @entity4 as they searched for the keys to the machine free at last : @entity4 eventually made his way out of the machine - and got to keep the cuddly toy ' he opened up the hatch and reached up to get it and when his bottom got under the hatch door it just flipped down			1
it came down on him			0
' she added : ' i do n't know how he managed to get in there			0
he 's only four but he 's a tall lad			0
' i was laughing my head off			0
i could see that he was fine and he was n't upset			0
' i had to go to the reception and tell them my son was stuck in the machine			2
they could n't believe it either			0
he was in there for a good half an hour			2
' @entity4 had previously gone for a swimming lesson with @entity23 , and was waiting for his sister @entity78 , seven , to finish her class when he got stuck in the machine			1
relief : @entity4 's mother @entity26 said she could tell that the young boy was unhurt while in the machine venue : @entity4 had just finished a swimming lesson at the @entity19 in @entity9 , pictured as staff hunted for the keys , mrs @entity34 tried to encourage @entity4 to open the machine from the inside , but he refused because he did n't want to release the teddy from his grasp			1
' they tried to take one side off but they could n't find the keys , ' she said			2
' we were asking him to reach up and get at the screws but he would n't let go of the teddy			2
eventually they managed to get the other side open			0
' i said to the lady , " i hope you 'll let him have it , " and they did			0
he has n't let go of it since			0
he went to bed with it that night			0
' mrs @entity34 , who lives in @entity9 with husband @entity109 , added : ' when i showed his dad he laughed too			2
he said it was the kind of thing he would have done when he was young			0
' @entity4 is very adventurous			2
i 'm worried he 's going to do it again to get another toy because it really did n't bother him			0
