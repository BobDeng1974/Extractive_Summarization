he is known as ' @entity1 ' , has been likened to a swan and , within poker circles , labelled a phenomenon			0
there are many faces - if the myths are believed - to the mysterious @entity9 owner @entity8 ; a quiet , private man whose club are very much centre of attention today when @entity14 visit the @entity15 in the fourth round of the @entity17			1
he was nicknamed @entity1 by an old friend who claimed he had alligator blood at the card tables , from where his career winnings are somewhere in excess of £ 2million			2
fans of @entity9 have likened him more to a swan ; calm , sleek and elegant above the surface , but legs kicking fast below the waterline to get where he wants			1
@entity9 owner @entity8 is known as ' @entity1 ' and has invested £ 200m into his boyhood club @entity8 will be hoping his @entity9 players can cause an @entity17 shock against @entity14 on sunday the @entity34 know they face a daunting task against the @entity36 who boast the talents of @entity39 @entity8 ’s exact wealth is unknown but he has already invested approximately £ 200m in @entity9 , sums that have secured a new home and bright future for the club he followed as a boy			1
and so , on days like today , when the @entity17 holders are in town , he is worth his weight in gold in the eyes of @entity34 ’ supporters , who may not know this most reclusive of figures , but have much to thank him for			1
@entity8 , 44 , studied maths at @entity55 , then became a professional gambler , a trader in the @entity58 and eventually made a fortune setting up online betting firm @entity60 in 2002 and selling it for £ 1m three years later			1
now a property developer and director of 12 companies , high - stakes poker was the launching pad to his empire building and he is convinced it has given him the tools for his role at @entity9			1
in one of his rare interviews four years ago , he said : ‘ poker gives you a good grounding in lots of things , including reading situations and reading people and making tough decisions			0
those skills can be used in business and certainly in running a football club			2
’ certainly @entity9 would not have been able to move into their @entity15 , which opened in 2011 , were it not for his £ 93m investment when he took over in 2009			1
@entity85 , chairman of the @entity86 , first met @entity8 when he replaced the club ’s previous chairman @entity87			1
@entity8 took over the reigns at @entity9 from @entity87 ( right ) in 2009 and funded their @entity15 ‘ we always thought you never know whether he will gamble with the club and end up losing it , ’ said @entity85			1
‘ but having met @entity8 , he does n’t strike me as a gambler			1
that ’s probably why he ’s good at it			0
‘ we worked hard to get the stadium on its way but did n’t have the money to do it			0
originally it was going to be funded by grants , but they did n’t materialise			0
if @entity8 had n’t come along we would n’t have the stadium			1
the fact he ’s a fan and he and his family go back with the club was important			0
he ’s very driven in what he wants			0
passionate , but does n’t show passion			0
a bit like a swan , calm above the water but maybe paddling like mad underneath			0
’ @entity8 is known to travel to away games via train and engages with fans , when he could easily afford to get there via a chauffeur - driven car			1
but for all the niceties , there is , predictably for such a successful businessman , a ruthless streak			0
the lizard has cold blood			0
@entity8 said in one interview , having declined to speak to @entity125 : ‘ when it comes to football , people get very emotional and when i ’m watching a game , i ’m as emotional as the rest of them			2
‘ but running the football club , it ’s really important to get that emotion to the back			0
otherwise you ’ll end up doing what a lot of chairmen always do and make some horrendous decisions			0
’ when @entity8 first offered the money to build the @entity15 , then chairman @entity87 wanted to remain in charge , teach @entity8 the job then unveil him as the man taking over when the stadium was opened two years later			1
in has autobiography @entity150 , @entity87 wrote : ‘ @entity8 looked at me , it was an odd look as if to say why ? he said , “ i do n’t need to do that			2
i ’m going to run the club in a very different way from the way you have			0
i do n’t think i need your advice ”			0
’ @entity9 boss @entity157 ( left ) will hope his side can put their poor league form to the side in the @entity17 according to sources close to @entity87 , that is a much more polite version of events than the reality			1
@entity8 had his way and fans welcomed this local lad whose family are intrinsically linked to the club			1
his grandfather , @entity170 , was vice-chairman when they were promoted to the old @entity172 in 1979 and died of a heart attack on the team coach on the way to an away fixture against @entity177			0
his uncle , @entity178 , was a director at the club before @entity8 stepped up , and remains one			1
@entity8 attended games as a youngster , but is not recalled on the terraces and fans suspect he was a guest in the directors ’ box with family			2
his ownership of @entity9 feels less like a gamble and more an act of love			2
he has covered their losses in recent seasons , totalling 10s of millions and paid for their £ 32m training ground and academy which opened last summer and was awarded the highest ever score by the @entity198 ’s independent auditor for a facility			0
they are struggling this season but have narrowly missed out on promotion via the play - offs in the previous two and there is no denying that , based on the structure of the club , they are ready for the top flight			0
their 30,250 stadium will be packed for the visit of @entity14			2
lizard , swan or just a businessman with a soft spot for his local club , @entity9 can be happy @entity8 is leading the way			1
@entity216 ( front ) scored twice as @entity218 knocked @entity9 out of @entity220 play - offs in 2013			2
