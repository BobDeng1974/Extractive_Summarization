by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 17 january 2013 a hospital has admitted it was to blame for the death of a baby after a horrified mother was forced to point out to midwives that her baby was n't breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck			1
@entity9 , 26 , was left in agony following a horrific labour at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , where midwives failed to act despite her baby 's head being stuck in the birth canal for 90 minutes			1
and when @entity21 was finally delivered , nurses placed her straight onto her mother 's chest - where terrified miss @entity9 had to beg nurses to help when she noticed her newborn was n't breathing as the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck			1
horrific experience : @entity9 , pictured with her partner @entity28 , started experiencing problems during labour with her first child when the baby 's head became stuck in the birth canal for 90 minutes tragic : @entity36 's umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck and she was n't breathing when she was finally born			1
@entity37 suffered severe brain damage and her life support machine was switched off three days after her birth on july 14 , 2011 admitting fault : the @entity42 of @entity43 which runs @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , has admitted full liability for the errors that led to @entity21 's death medics then whisked her first born away to be resuscitated - but her daughter suffered huge brain damage			1
her parents @entity52 and @entity28 , 30 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , were advised that nothing more could be done and the devastating decision was taken to switch off life support three days after she was born , on july 14 , 2011			1
this week , the hospital has admitted full liability for the errors and delays which lead to @entity37 's death			1
miss @entity9 said : ' i had a healthy pregnancy and for everything to go so badly wrong at the end has been very difficult to cope with			1
expecting : @entity9 ' pregnancy , pictured on a 20 week scan , had been perfectly healthy up until the birth stunned : new mother @entity52 was forced to point out to nurses that her daughter was n't breathing when they handed her over after the birth worst nightmare : doctors managed to resuscitate @entity37 before telling heartbroken parents @entity52 and her partner @entity28 there was nothing more they could do to help their daughter ' i went through a long , painful labour and was totally exhausted			1
i was terrified but the midwife was totally disinterested in me			0
' the midwives told me my baby 's head was crowning and to keep pushing , but i did and nothing was happening			2
' i had never had a baby before but i pushed for more than an hour and a half and i instinctively knew something was n't right - i was really scared			0
' this was my first labour and , like most first time mums , i put my complete trust in the midwives who i thought knew best			0
' when we found out the extent of @entity37 's injuries , we were devastated			1
' agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing i have ever done			0
' mother @entity9 ' at one point the midwife admitted that she could n't find the baby 's heartbeat any more but just passed it off , saying it was probably because my pelvic bone was blocking the sound of the heartbeat			1
' i had to trust her so i tried not to worry			0
i had been in labour for hours and was exhausted			0
' she did n't try to reassure me , or tell me what to do - my mum , @entity107 , who is a care support worker at the same hospital , and @entity28 , helped me get comfortable			0
' they were the ones reminding me to breathe and telling me it would be ok , while the midwife just stood there			0
' when i finally gave birth , i was so relieved i had finally managed to deliver my baby			0
' i was so excited when they handed her over to me straight away , but when i looked at her i could tell straight away that she was n't breathing			2
i felt sick , my emotions were all over the place			0
' i could see the cord knotted around her neck - it looked like it had been strangling her			2
i started screaming : " she 's not breathing " , and suddenly someone came and took her off me			2
tough decision : three days after @entity37 was born , her parents made the heartbreaking decision to turn her life support machine off ' all the midwives went with @entity37 , and i was left alone , terrified of what was happening			1
' @entity28 went to try and find out what was going on , and my mum looked after me and helped clean me up , because there was no - one else there to do it			0
' when we found out the extent of @entity37 's injuries , we were devastated			1
she was our first child , and we were so excited about becoming parents			0
' agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing i have ever done			0
saying goodbye : @entity9 holds her baby daughter @entity37 one last time before doctors switched off life support ' after it was clear that @entity37 had substantial brain damage , the midwives all avoided us			1
no - one came to see if we were alright , or look after us			0
' miss @entity9 , who now has an eight - month - old daughter with partner @entity28 , an engineer , says she hopes that maternity services have since been improved so no other mother has the same experience			1
she added : ' i am so angry about what happened			0
this was my first labour and , like most first time mums , i put my complete trust in the midwives who i thought knew best			0
' their mistakes led to us being robbed of our beautiful baby girl and although the hospital has apologised , nothing can turn back the clock			2
' if i could give advice to any other expectant mum , it would be to make sure the midwife regularly checks your baby 's heartbeat during labour and insist on a second opinion if necessary because things can go wrong at the last minute			1
' i wish i 'd had someone there to tell me this			0
' my daughter @entity188 is now eight months old , and it breaks my heart she will never know her big sister			0
' i just want to make sure this does n't happen ever again - no - one deserves to go through what i did			0
' i can only hope that the @entity43 has improved maternity services so that no other family has to go through the heartache that we have			0
' medical law experts have criticised the midwives ' ' wait and see ' attitude that lead to @entity37 's death			1
lawyers from @entity205 law firm instructed by the couple found that midwives at @entity12 failed to correctly monitor @entity209 's heart rate or call a doctor for help when no heart beat could be found			1
following legal action , the @entity42 of @entity43 has admitted full liability for the errors which led to @entity37 's death			1
family : @entity9 and her partner @entity28 now have a baby daughter called @entity188			2
miss @entity9 says it breaks her heart she will never be able to meet her big sister @entity37 @entity222 from @entity205 's @entity224 office , who specialises in birth claims , said : ' this is a tragic case and @entity9 and @entity28 understandably remain completely devastated by the death of their first child			1
' the trust has admitted that the care @entity9 received from their midwives fell well short of acceptable standards			2
they agreed with our medical expert 's view that , as the birth was taking longer than expected and attempts to listen to the baby 's heart were unsuccessful , the midwives should have called for urgent medical help			2
' had they done so it would have become apparent that @entity37 was in distress , earlier delivery would have resulted and on balance @entity209 would have survived			2
' although the trust has now admitted liability they need to now reassure patients that the problems identified have been acted upon and that the midwives concerned have been retrained so that no other parents suffer such unnecessary tragedy			2
' @entity256 , chief executive of the @entity257 , said : ' we would like to offer our most sincere condolences to @entity9 on the sad loss of her baby , @entity37 , at three days old			1
' we have received a claim which is now in the hands of the @entity43 's legal team			0
unfortunately we are unable to comment further			0
