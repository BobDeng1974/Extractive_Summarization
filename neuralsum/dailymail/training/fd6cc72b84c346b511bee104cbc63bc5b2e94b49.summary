historian @entity0 has been labelled a homophobic ' pub bigot ' for suggesting that the economist @entity2 did n't care about future generations because he was gay and childless			1
professor @entity0 quickly issued an abject apology , insisting that his ' stupid and insensitive ' remarks at a conference had been ' off the cuff '			1
but he failed to mollify critics , with one claiming yesterday that the @entity10 - born @entity9 academic had made similar remarks about @entity2 's sexuality before			1
' stupid and insensitive ' : @entity9 historian @entity0 , left , has apologised for suggesting the economist @entity2 , right , did not care about the future because he was gay and childless professor @entity0 , 49 , an advocate of austerity policies , had tried to use @entity2 's famous observation that ' in the long run , we are all dead ' against him in a sideswipe at the @entity23 economist 's ' selfish ' support for high government spending			1
he was apparently responding to a question about the contrast between the economic philosophy of self - interest of @entity2 , who died in 1946 , and that of @entity30 in the 18th century who believed there was a social contract among the living , the dead and those yet to be born			0
controversy : @entity0 with his wife @entity38 according to a report of his address to financial advisers and investors in @entity45 on thursday , during a post-speech question and answer session @entity0 asked his audience how many children @entity2 had			2
he then explained that @entity2 married a ballerina but had a string of gay affairs			0
@entity2 was an ' effete ' member of society who would rather talk of poetry than procreate , professor @entity0 reportedly added			2
commentators rounded on the historian , who has four children from two marriages , for implying that gays or people with no children do not care about future generations			1
gay rights campaigner @entity61 said he was glad the professor had apologised for his ' homophobic slur ' against @entity2			0
but he added : ' his remarks are what we might expect from a pub bigot , not from a @entity9 history professor			0
' @entity68 , a financial writer who was in the audience , said : ' apparently , in @entity0 's world , if you are gay or childless you can not care about future generations nor society			1
' professor @entity0 said : ' i made comments about @entity2 that were as stupid as they were insensitive			1
i should not have suggested – in an off - the - cuff response that was not part of my presentation – that @entity2 was indifferent to the long run because he had no children , nor that he had no children because he was gay			2
it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations			1
' he insisted his disagreements with @entity2 have never had anything to do with the latter 's sexual orientation , and went on : ' as those who know me and my work are well aware , i detest all prejudice , sexual or otherwise			2
' ' his remarks are what we might expect from a pub bigot ' : @entity61 said it was ' shocking ' that a history professor had made a ' homophobic slur ' against the economist @entity2 the professor admitted he had ' forgotten ' that @entity2 's wife , @entity106 ballerina @entity105 , became pregnant with his child in 1927 but miscarried			1
@entity109 economist @entity108 attacked professor @entity0 's ' empty ' apology , saying on @entity111 : ' these were not '' off the cuff '' remarks			2
i heard him make the same over 20 years ago at a history seminar he gave at @entity116 , @entity109			0
' others flagged up a passage in professor @entity0 's 1999 book @entity120 in which he said @entity2 's sex life went ' into a decline ' during the @entity123 ' perhaps because the boys he liked to pick up in @entity125 all joined up '			1
@entity2 , hailed by @entity126 as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century , has influenced generations of politicians with his argument that governments should steer the economy through downturns rather than rely on the free market			0
he was open about his many homosexual affairs			0
professor @entity0 , who says he turned to @entity137 as a student at @entity139 , has a reputation as a defender of western imperialism but has attracted controversy before			0
in 2011 the historian and broadcaster threatened to sue a book reviewer who the professor said had accused him of being a racist			0
he and his second wife , the @entity151 - @entity150 writer @entity38 , have a 17 - month old son .			0

prof. @entity0 suggested @entity2 did not care about future generations
he insisted his ' insensitive ' remarks at a conference had been cut off
but critics claim he has made remarks about @entity2 's sexuality before
