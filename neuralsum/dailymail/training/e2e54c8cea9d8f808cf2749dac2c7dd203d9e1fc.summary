by @entity1 reporter published : 07:01 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 14 january 2013 a large cuddly toy left on a grass bank triggered an alert that a large black cat may be on the loose			1
@entity7 - eyed @entity6 contacted his local paper after spotting what appears to be the outline of a black panther - like creature lying on a grass verge outside @entity15 police station in @entity16 , @entity17			1
mr @entity6 , who had just been dropping off his son at nursery , said he had to stop when he saw the ' animal ' and take a picture			0
cat or cuddly toy ? @entity24 took this picture of a ' panther - like creature ' lying outside @entity27 in @entity16 , @entity17 he said it thought it was bizarre because it was right outside the police station			1
he told the @entity30 : ' i was driving along to drop my son off at nursery when i saw what looked like the biggest black cat or panther sat on a verge right outside the police station			1
' i stopped my car for a few seconds so i could take a picture on my mobile phone			0
i did n't get out of my car and i must have been about 10 metres or so away from it			0
i 'm sure other people saw it too			0
' my reaction was intrigue more than anything , i just thought it was really odd			0
i was n't convinced it was real because it did n't seem to be moving			0
' the real thing : but the cuddly toy turned out to be no where near as dangerous as an actual panther a spokesman for @entity56 said officers had received a call on monday afternoon from someone reporting a @entity61 walking along a grass verge in @entity63 , @entity16			1
however , the spokesman added that a very large stuffed toy cat had been seen in the same area earlier the same day			2
@entity66 , founder of the @entity67 , said : ' this looks to me like a large cuddly toy			1
' the sighting rekindled speculation about the mythical ' @entity72 ' - a large black cat reputedly sighted in @entity74 and most recently spotted on a footpath in @entity76 , @entity77 , by @entity79 worker @entity78 in august 2011			2
mr @entity66 added : ' there are hundreds , if not thousands of big cat sightings reported in @entity82 every year - some people are mistaken			1
some are clearly not big cats but a large majority either are or go unexplained			2
' he said sightings are widespread and occur in every county , fuelled partly by the fact such ' big cats ' are able to cover 25km to 35km in one night in search of shelter , food or a mate			2
in august last year , there was a reported sighting of a big cat in @entity99 after a local took a blurry picture of a furry black figure sprinting through woodland in @entity103			1
months earlier , nearby resident @entity104 released footage showing a 6ft - long beast stalking through fields close by			0
she claims to have first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in @entity111 , near @entity112 , @entity113 , in july 2009 and says she has seen it five times since			0
a previous ' panther ' sighting : this picture taken in february 2012 shows a furry black figure sprinting through woodland near @entity103 , @entity113 carcasses of deer , sheep and wallabies have been found strewn across the county several times last year , with some suggesting it lends credence to the theory a big cat is on the loose			1
another famous case was that of the ' @entity130 ' after holidaymakers at caravan park nesr @entity133 in @entity130 claimed to have spotted a lion in nearby fields			2
the culprit was believed to be a three - year - old moggie called @entity138 , owned by @entity139 , who said he does look quite lion - like			0
a @entity141 , which is the largest domestic cat breed and can weigh up to 25lb , @entity138 lives near the caravan park and likes wandering around in the field where witnesses claimed they 'd seen the lion			0
@entity130 or tabby cat ? images similar to this one were handed to @entity150 police in august sparking a large - scale search for the ' @entity130 ' @entity138 , the @entity141 owned by @entity152 , pictured , is believed to have been mistaken for the @entity130 lion after he was possibly spotted stalking around his home in @entity133 , @entity130			1

@entity24 took this picture of a ' panther - like creature ' outside @entity15 police station in @entity16 , @entity17
but the panther was actually a large cuddly toy left on a grass verge
comes after ' big cat ' sightings in @entity99 and reports of a lion in @entity130
