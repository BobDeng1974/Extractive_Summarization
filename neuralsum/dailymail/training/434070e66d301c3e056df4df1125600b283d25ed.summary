a new high speed rail line between @entity3 and the north is needed to allow thousands of southern @entity6 fans to get to the game more quickly , the project 's boss suggested today			1
high speed 2 chairman sir @entity8 said the current two hour trip between @entity3 and @entity11 meant people had to ' allow for a full day ' if they wanted to get to @entity13			1
but he said a new £ 50billion line would slash journey times in half , adding : ' if you knew guaranteed that a train was going to take an hour to get from @entity3 to @entity11 you could get up for a football game or for a meeting and be back and save the rest of the day			1
backed by prime minister @entity32 and chancellor @entity24 , @entity29 would mean journey times between @entity34 and @entity11 could almost be cut in half			1
journeys between @entity34 and @entity37 , @entity34 and @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity37 and @entity40 to @entity37 could also be reduced by a half or more , and many more journeys across the country substantially shortened			0
speaking on @entity46 's today programme , sir @entity8 said his plans for @entity29 were ' a start of a conversation '			1
he said : ' this is not just a single project			0
it 's more than the eye - catching journey - time reductions			1
@entity29 will give northern @entity56 rail services twice the capacity and much more reliability			0
' phase one of @entity23 involves a new high - speed line from @entity61 in @entity3 passing through @entity63 heartlands in the @entity64 to @entity37 , with sir @entity8 saying today that its completion would be in 2027			1
a new high speed rail line between @entity3 and @entity11 will cost around £ 50billion @entity6 fans in the south of @entity56 will be able to travel to watch the game in just an hour , sir @entity8 said this morning phase two would see the line extended north from @entity37 in a y - shaped route going to @entity11 and @entity34 , with sir @entity8 saying this would be completed in 2033			1
the project is strongly supported by the government but is bitterly opposed by some councils and residents along the phase one route			0
mr @entity32 said : ' improving connectivity and reducing journey times between our great northern cities is a crucial part of our long - term economic plan for the north to boost businesses and create more jobs and security for hard - working people			1
that 's why we are backing @entity29			0
' i welcome sir @entity8 ' report , which will help our work to create a northern powerhouse and ensure that @entity23 delivers the maximum economic benefits			1
' mr @entity24 said : ' the vision i set out earlier this year of the northern powerhouse we could build is rapidly taking shape			0
' i asked sir @entity8 to look at how we deliver the better transport links across the @entity101 that would make a reality of that powerhouse			2
' i 'm delighted with the rapid response and the report			0
today we take another big step forward in delivering both the @entity23 links from north to south and the @entity29 link across the @entity109			2
' sir @entity8 's report said there was a need to take forward both legs of the proposed @entity23 y - network as the alternatives would not bring the same capacity , connectivity and economic benefits ; for @entity29 , the journey from @entity34 to @entity11 could be cut from today 's average of more than 55 minutes to somewhere between 26 and 35 minutes and the number of trains could be doubled			1
sir @entity8 said : ' improving connectivity is vital if @entity124 is to compete in the knowledge economy in which this country has a competitive advantage , but in which ease of travel is an essential element			2
' on the back of new transport infrastructure , science investment and civic leadership , we are well on our way to turning the northern powerhouse into reality			0
' deputy prime minister @entity140 , transport secretary @entity141 and chief secretary to the treasury @entity142 also welcomed the report , as did @entity146 chairman @entity145			0
she said : ' @entity23 is important strategic infrastructure but must be linked with improvements in the classic rail network to bring maximum benefit			2
' the @entity152 , representing @entity153 and rail operators , said the report ' underlines how @entity23 will become the backbone of @entity124 's growing railway '			2
@entity159 campaign manager @entity158 said @entity29 would be even more expensive per mile than @entity23			2
he added that sir @entity8 's report ' showed that the original plans for @entity23 were n't thought through properly '			1
mr @entity158 went on : ' changing the mess that is phase two does n't change the fact that phase one is still a complete mess , as is the entire concept of @entity23			0
' shadow transport secretary @entity167 said : ' hard - pressed travellers in the @entity101 will judge @entity32 on his actions , not words			0
' leaders of councils in northern @entity56 welcomed the report , with @entity174 , leader of @entity175 , describing @entity23 as ' the key to transforming the future economy of @entity34 and the north '			0
the @entity180 transport union said it was ' cynical in the extreme that the cheerleaders behind today 's announcement are threatening to devastate ( northern railway ) jobs and services ' .			0

@entity8 said people had to ' allow for a full day ' to get to @entity11
the @entity23 chair said a new £ 50billion line would slash journey times in half
said a one - hour journey would mean ' you could get up for a football game '
