inspired by @entity6 's launch of a new first class luxury suite named ' @entity8 ' , crowd sourcing travel website @entity3 has devised a comprehensive list of the 24 best first class in - flight cabins from around the world			1
to produce the list , they took into account everything from seat configuration , aisle access and suite privacy to the type of champagne served , whether pyjamas were provided and how caviar was plated			1
@entity27 was crowned king of the skies while second place went to @entity67 airline @entity31 and @entity68 bagged bronze			1
when @entity6 's @entity8 launches in december it will raise the bar even higher , offering guests a three room fully staffed suite , a chauffeur to a private check - in and lounge , an onboard butler , fine @entity80 @entity79 leather sofa , two dining tables and - better yet - an in flight personal chef to whip up whatever takes your fancy			1
