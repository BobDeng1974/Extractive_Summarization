it was great while it lasted for @entity1 at the @entity2 on saturday afternoon , unfortunately it only lasted for two minutes			0
the @entity4 manager saw his team take the lead after just 40 seconds only for @entity7 to equalise with their next attack and run out 4 - 1 winners			1
‘ we gave ourselves a platform but there was no time to build it on			2
i do n’t think we touched the ball between scoring and their equaliser , ’ said @entity1 , who added : ‘ at times we could n’t lay a glove on them			2
i ’ve seen the best team in the world today			0
they are world [ club ] champions and they played that way today especially in the first half			0
’ it was @entity29 ’ first ever match in the famous stadium			2
he spoke pre-match about having dreamed of coming here with @entity34 or @entity35			0
the start was the stuff of dreams as his team scored with their first attack			0
@entity40 slots home @entity7 's fourth of the afternoon as they ran out comfortable winners at the @entity44 @entity40 gestures towards the supporters after he is congratulated by his team - mates after giving @entity7 a three - goal cushion benzema wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity7 's third goal as they cruised to victory against @entity4 @entity53 wheels away in celebration after giving @entity7 the lead 10 minutes before half time the @entity56 international falls to his knees in celebration after he prods home to give the home side the lead @entity63 equalises for @entity7 with his head in the third minute of the @entity66 match against @entity4 @entity63 is mobbed by his team - mates after @entity7 come up with an instant reply against @entity1 's side at the @entity44 @entity7 : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity53 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 81 ) , @entity63 ( @entity76 74 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity40 ( @entity79 81 ) subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 scorer ( s ) : @entity86 , @entity53 36 , @entity40 51 , 76 booked : @entity73 30 , @entity72 70 , @entity75 87 @entity4 : @entity87 , @entity88 ( @entity89 63 ) , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 ( @entity98 46 ) , @entity99 ( @entity100 17 ) subs not used : @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 scorer ( s ) : @entity88 1 , booked : @entity92 referee : @entity107 @entity92 took a corner from the @entity4 left and 21 - year - old right back @entity109 headed it past @entity69			1
this was @entity111 all over again for @entity1			0
his team scored against the @entity113 with their first attack when they played them at the start of the year			0
they held on for all three points on a famous night at @entity118 – here the glory did n’t last as long			1
@entity72 was played in down the left and when he crossed , the unmarked @entity63 was left clear to head in the equalizer			1
@entity4 were not completely knocked out of their stride however and two former @entity7 players linked up to so nearly give them their second goal			1
it was @entity96 who shot from the edge of the area and @entity128 stretched to turn it in but could n’t quite send it past @entity69			0
the @entity56 keeper saved a shot from @entity94 and @entity1 still had some reasons to remain optimistic but things took a turn for the worse when @entity99 went down holding his knee			0
he hobbled off , then hobbled back on , and was finally taken off and replaced by @entity100			0
@entity4 were severely weakened and @entity7 began to find their passes going forward as @entity87 kept his team in the game			1
he saved brilliantly from @entity40 and then from @entity63 as @entity7 stepped up the pressure			1
@entity78 , who was once again booed by sections of the @entity44 crowd , should have put @entity7 ahead but dragged his shot wide and the @entity143 then headed a @entity74 corner just beyond @entity87 ’s far post			1
@entity7 were getting closer to scoring a second despite @entity87 ’s best efforts and when the young @entity149 keeper blocked @entity40 's shot it dropped to @entity53 who scored			1
with the sleet falling , @entity1 now cut a slightly more forlorn figure in the technical area and he was also starting to despair at his team ’s defending with @entity78 again guilty of poor finishing after @entity40 had been allowed to break down the left			2
as the sleet turned to snow the only consolation was that the visitors had made it to half time with only a goal between the two sides			0
the @entity165 midfielder pumps the air in celebration after his goal cancels out @entity4 's first - minute opener goalscorer @entity109 ( left ) celebrates with @entity170 after shocking @entity7 in the first minute the @entity4 players join goalscorer @entity109 after the 20 - year - old netted his first goal for the club on saturday @entity78 , who missed a great chance to score in the first half , takes control of the ball during the @entity66 clash @entity78 squares the ball as he bears down on the @entity4 goalkeeper during the routine win mangers @entity1 and @entity183 share a warm embrace before the match @entity1 prowls the touchline with a grimace on his face in the wet conditions at the @entity44 the early indications from the second half were that things were not going to stay that way for very long			1
the first warning came when @entity63 , @entity78 and @entity77 combined brilliantly only for the latter to blaze over			2
the next chance fell to @entity40 and was greedily accepted			2
he played a one - two with @entity78 down the left and the man who some supporters have described as selfish in recent weeks played a selfless and perfectly measured pass to the feet of the @entity202 who converted the chance before embracing the assist provider			0
with @entity206 watching from his private box with son @entity206 junior @entity78 went into generosity overdrive gifting @entity40 with another chance with a clever flick			2
had the @entity202 not been obstructed in the area he would surely have doubled his tally			0
@entity40 was then inches from an @entity77 cross – it could have been a hat - trick inside barely a minute			1
the @entity202 has , like @entity78 suffered at the hands of the @entity44 , but they were on their feet singing his name 15 minutes from time with the goal of the game curling a shot past @entity87 from just inside the area			2
all that was missing for the home side was one of @entity78 ’s customary goals in the absence of @entity206			1
@entity7 ’s top scorer has missed 11 games since @entity78 has been at the club and @entity78 has scored 11 goals in those matches			1
when he raced clear with 10 minutes left after another defensive lapse from @entity4 it looked as if he would score goal number five for @entity7 but @entity87 came out to block his shot			1
the visiting keeper had actually put a favourable gloss on the result for @entity1			0
how different things had looked after just 40 seconds .			0

@entity4 took a *surprise* lead in the first minute as @entity109 headed home from a corner
@entity7 were not behind for long though as @entity63 hit back in the third minute to level the scores
@entity53 gave the home side the lead when he prodded home after @entity87 saved from @entity40
@entity40 added a third for @entity7 to make the points safe for @entity183 's side
the @entity259 striker then scored his second and @entity7 's fourth of the match as the hosts cruised to victory
