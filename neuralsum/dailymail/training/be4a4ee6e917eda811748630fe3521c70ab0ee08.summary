' @entity25 ' : this is @entity9 hill fort in @entity10 , the ' magical ' landscape that the @entity7 has bought in a bid to preserve the 6,000 - year - old pastures the @entity5 fort is the first the trust has acquired for 30 years and overlies one of the most significant early neolithic landscapes in western @entity35 dating back almost 6,000 years , the trust said			1
causeway enclosures seen on the hill date back 5,500 years , and together with nearby @entity7 - owned @entity40 the site tells the story of the beginnings of farming , the need for defence and the arrival of the @entity47 in @entity16 , the trust said			2

' wandering around a site whose human history pre-dates @entity2 and takes you back to the early days of farming makes the heart skip a beat			0
' the sound of a skylark ascending above the rich grassland and sight of a cloud of @entity52 blue butterflies in flight touches the soul			0
this is a place where you feel totally connected to the world around you			0
' @entity100 , a @entity7 volunteer working on @entity9 , said : ' when i come here i feel like someone would when they go into @entity104			2
younger : the first stones at @entity2 , near @entity107 , were thought to be raised in 2200 @entity108 , making it far younger than the @entity110 bought by the @entity7 scale : the hill is twice the height of the @entity3 , which stand at 350 feet , and from the summit , three counties are visible : @entity10 , @entity23 and @entity24 ' when there is no one else around and i sit on the top of the hill looking at the view i feel very privileged			1
and to play a small part in looking after the hill is a good feeling			0
