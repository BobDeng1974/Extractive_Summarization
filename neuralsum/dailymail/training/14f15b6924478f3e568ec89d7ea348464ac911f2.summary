by @entity0 published : 12:58 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 25 february 2013 for internet addicts , it could be the ultimate way to stay in touch - an entire apartment turned into a giant , online screen			1
the walls show @entity8 updates , and life - sized friends during video chats			1
it can also be controlled from anywhere - even bed - using gestures or speech			1
' the hardware is complete but only 40 per cent of the software is finished , ' said @entity28 , director of @entity30 , a @entity31 design agency which created the project			2
' everything in the house can be used to communicate , the interface is ubiquitous			2
' through projections that are activated by the presence of a person , we can control everything with the movement of the hands : the lights ; turning on any electrical household appliances ; music ; even connecting to @entity46 for a conference from any part of the house			2
' the system aims to replace the current slew of keyboards and remote controls needed to interact with technology			1
however , mr @entity55 much of the technology will be invisible			0
' i do nâ€™t think that an @entity17 home is going to look any different , ' he said			1
' new technologies must be non-intrusive and natural			0
' mr @entity60 says the first inhabitant has already moved into the experimental apartment			0
' he is using some parts of the house , and we are learning from that			0
one of the prototype apps places the user inside @entity69 , with projections on every wall ' the main interface is in the living room , where you can see social networks , magazines , and play music just using gestures , ' he said			1
the prototype uses sensing cameras such as @entity82 's @entity81 to track users , allowing them to swipe in mid air to move through menus			0
the project started three years ago , and the prototype built in an apartment in the @entity89 , all using existing technology			0
' now we have around 40 % of the applications actually running - and we hope to finish soon , then begin developing products so people can actually begin using it			0
' the wall can display anything , form video to a user 's @entity8 and @entity100 feeds the system even allows video chats using a life sized video projection of the person you are talking to			2

entire system can be controlled by gestures or speech
@entity17 system uses projectors and sensors already available to turn walls and even *floors* into interactive screens
