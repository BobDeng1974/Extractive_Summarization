by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 8 april 2013 she caused outrage for suing a burglary victim after falling over a kerb during a 999 call			1
now pc @entity7 has done it again by demanding compensation from her own force over a car crash			1
the constable was in a police car which skidded off the road and ended on its side during a chase in january last year			1
proud : @entity18 with her father @entity19 on her first day as a police officer @entity21 put in a compensation claim to @entity23 , which would not discuss details			1
her lawyers said she injured her knee and her employers accepted liability			2
seven months after this claim she instructed the firm to sue @entity33 petrol station owner @entity32			1
the divorced mother of two fell on a kerb while helping him look for burglars at the garage in august last year , hurting her left leg and right wrist			1
after her astonishing claim became public , her own chief constable , @entity42 , criticised it as ‘ surprising and disappointing ’			2
@entity21 is pursuing both claims			0
her lawyers , @entity48 , said : ‘ @entity7 believes she has the right to go to work and not be harmed by someone else ’s negligence			1
’ crash : a norfolk police patrol car like the one which was involved in a crash while @entity58 @entity7 , 33 , was inside accident scene : the petrol station in @entity61 , @entity33 , where @entity58 @entity7 tripped on the kerb while responding to a 999 call and is now suing the owner how the @entity65 broke the story : the @entity67 led the way on this issue a week ago with its front - page exclusive on @entity18 , pictured right , which provoked a huge amount of controversy and intense public debate			1
more than 1,500 readers posted comments on the @entity76 , nearly all of them scathing about her decision to sue the garage owner			1
the news comes two days after the @entity67 revealed that pc @entity81 is suing a @entity84 burglary victim for £ 10,000 after allegedly tearing his @entity85 falling into a drain			1
the @entity87 is backing @entity21 ’s action against mr @entity21 , who is not related to the officer			0
it says she wants to claw back ‘ lost earnings ’			0
but it is understood she has lost only overtime and night shift pay as she was on a full salary while recovering from both incidents			1
@entity21 is on sick leave but is due back on active duty soon			0
more than 8,000 police officers have claimed £ 67million compensation in the past four years , figures show			1
the @entity87 data led to calls for a review of the system			0
÷ further examples of the out of control compensation culture emerged yesterday - this time in the fire service			1
in @entity111 , a fireman who hurt his hand on a locker won £ 250,000			0
another won a payout after he was injured avoiding a runaway cow , and a third was compensated after catching his fingers in a vacuum cleaner			0
police have sought huge sums for controversial claims			1
among them are : comment by @entity128 former deputy met assistant commissioner analysis : @entity128 , former deputy met assistant commissioner the news that a police officer is suing someone who called for help will be met with astonishment among members of the public and incredulity among many of her fellow officers , particularly those of my vintage			1
an increasing number of people are reluctant to call for assistance because they do not believe the police will be able to do anything			1
now they could also be concerned that the officers might end up suing them			2
how did we get to this desperate state of affairs ? in the mid-seventies when i started out on my police career , if you stumbled over a step or uneven paving slab , colleagues would say , ‘ enjoy your trip ? send us a postcard next time ! ’ there was no question of suing anyone , even if sometimes there may have been good reason			1
after the 1976 @entity170 riot , we began public order training			0
our riot helmets were reinforced cork and plastic and we used real bricks in training			0
inevitably a colleague got a brick square on the badge on the front of his helmet and the pin holding it in place went straight into his forehead , blood streaming down his face			0
to complain would have been seen as being a sissy , to sue unthinkable			0
but the officer was allowed as much time to recuperate , on full pay , as he wanted			1
the helmets were soon replaced with proper @entity193 - style crash helmets and wooden blocks replaced the lumps of brick			2
a sign that things were changing came a decade later , when i responded to an ambulance crew ’s call for assistance			0
i ended up rolling around on the pavement with the drunken man who had attacked them			2
when he had sobered up , he made a formal complaint and an investigation was launched			0
in interview , i was asked whether i had suffered any injury during the fight , to which i replied : ‘ not really , just a few scratches and grazes to my hands			0
’ the final report found i had not acted unreasonably , but i received a formal disciplinary finding against me for not recording the scrapes as an injury on duty			0
in those days , police officers who performed acts of bravery were praised by their bosses without hesitation			2
but in 2003 a serving and former met commissioner faced trial under the @entity229 after two officers in separate incidents fell through roofs while chasing suspects ; one officer sadly died and the other was seriously injured			2
while the commissioners were not convicted , the police attitude to acts of bravery changed			2
among other things , officers were told that they must not climb over a certain height , even if chasing a criminal or trying to save a life			0
i remember in 2005 attending a commissioner ’s @entity245 at @entity247			0
as a video shot from a police helicopter showed officers chasing suspects across steeply sloping rooftops , the senior officers in the audience sat ashen - faced , petrified that someone would report them to the @entity256			1
police officers have got to realise that policing is a potentially dangerous business			2
part of the thrill of being an operational officer is never knowing what is around the next corner or what challenge is going to face you			0
officers are protected by the courts , often being awarded damages against those who assault them as part of the criminal sanction passed by the judge			0
the bottom line is , police officers are protected financially from the kind of injury that the officer who tripped up the step at the filling station claims to be suffering from			1
nothing should get in the way of victims calling the police			2
@entity287 and a damaged ego are part of the job and , as we used to say : ‘ if you ca n’t take a joke , you should n’t have joined			0
