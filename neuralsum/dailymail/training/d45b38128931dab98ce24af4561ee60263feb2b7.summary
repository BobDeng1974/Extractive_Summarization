here , @entity12 assesses how the players performed			2
@entity23 - 6.5 slotted in at right - back with little fuss			1
the @entity27 man delivered some useful crosses , too			2
positive : @entity23 slotted in at right - back with little fuss and could become a regular feature for @entity4 @entity32 - 6.5 will play a lead role in the spine of this new @entity4 era			1
but for one slip , did what was needed			0
@entity38 - 6.5 played in a centre - back role that many believe is his best and did n't look out of place			0
commanding : @entity38 ( right ) played at centre - back for @entity4 and looked quite assured in the position @entity44 - 6 comfortable display from the @entity27 left - back , but looked a little lethargic at times			1
@entity47 - 6.5 seen as the heir to @entity50 's box - to - box role but did n't take grip of the game like his mentor			2
competitive : @entity47 ( right ) looked strong in midfield for @entity4 but he has to take control of games @entity58 - 6.5 should be the heartbeat of this team for the next 10 years			1
@entity62 - 6 did n't see enough of the ball to have a desired impact			0
@entity65 still a threat though			0
@entity67 : @entity68 was @entity4 's best player and won the penalty from which @entity0 netted @entity68 - 7.5 buzzed around like he owned the place			1
by far @entity4 's best player on the night			1
@entity0 - 6.5 the new @entity4 captain was too deep at times , but scored from the spot on his big evening			1
opportunity : @entity4 's best chance was missed by @entity77 in the first half against @entity6 at @entity7 skipper : @entity0 's first match as @entity4 captain saw him net the winner from the penalty spot @entity77 - 6.5 now established as his country 's premier striker and the @entity87 man looked the part on wednesday			1

@entity94 ( on for @entity58 , 70 ) - 6 slotted into central midfield			0
impact : @entity98 's new signing @entity99 ( left ) came off the bench to impress for @entity4 against @entity6 @entity99 ( on for @entity0 , 70 ) - 6.5 looked dangerous in attack			1
@entity102 ( on for @entity103 , 81 ) ; @entity104 ( @entity32 , 84 ) ; @entity105 ( @entity77 , 89 )			2
subs not used : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109			0

subs : @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136			0
per - @entity137 - 6 danger man : per @entity120 ( right ) played reasonably well for @entity6 and looked a threat on the ball threat : @entity22 of @entity142 and @entity6 had a reasonable game and should have scored referee : @entity145 ( @entity146 ) - 6 let the game flow			0
the match was played at a pre-season pace which helped the official			0
in charge : referee @entity145 of @entity146 controlled game reasonably well but it was played at a slow pace			0

@entity0 netted from the penalty spot in the 68th minute for @entity4
@entity158 striker was quiet on first appearance as captain
@entity68 impressive for @entity4 and their best performer on night
@entity23 , @entity47 and @entity77 all had steady nights
