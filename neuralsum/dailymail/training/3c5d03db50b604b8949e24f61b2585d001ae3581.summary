snooker legend @entity0 claims that too many players are treating tournaments ‘ like stag weekends ’ to ever do themselves justice			1
the seven - time world champion retired two years ago — though he has hinted that there may be a comeback , and some more competitive play left in the tank			1
but the 45 - year - old @entity10 has his ear close to the ground through former peers still on tour and in his capacity as a @entity17 analyst for the major events			2
@entity0 has claimed that too many players are treating tournaments ‘ like stag weekends ’ @entity0 , who enjoyed a long and fierce rivalry with @entity23 , insists players like the @entity25 and @entity26 back up their ability with hours of dedication and toil			1
@entity0 made huge sacrifices to be the best , leaving no stone unturned to become a better player , and he respects @entity23 ’s move to seek a breakthrough with dr @entity35 three years ago			1
he said : ‘ to other players out there frustrated with their form or careers , i would say look at @entity23 compared to where he was a few years ago — or @entity26			1
‘ @entity26 has worked very closely with his coach @entity42 , and sometimes you just need one thing to trigger it for you or kick - start things			2
just something , anything , whatever it is that does it for you as a player or gives you some extra belief			0
‘ and when you consider the likes of @entity55 perhaps they just need that something , whether it is talking to someone , anything that can give him an extra edge			0
‘ perhaps in @entity0 ’s case he is more the man ’s man type and dealing with sports psychologists and sports psychiatrists or whatever might be seen as wimping out , he tries to do it all himself			2
@entity0 said he was impressed that @entity23 had sought the help of dr @entity35 ‘ but if it is good enough for some of the other top sports people in the world , and we can all name them in other sports , then it must be good enough for him			1
but some of these players need to look at what they are doing			0
i am not on tour any more but i hear things , and there are stories that some players are not as dedicated as they should be , and treating some of these @entity82 events in @entity83 as stag weekends rather than tournaments			1
every player has to look at himself and what he is doing			0
’ @entity23 was drawn against @entity88 for the first round of his @entity91 defence next month , representing an awkward tie against the recent @entity94 winner in @entity95			2
the match of the first round at @entity98 in north @entity99 looks to be world champion @entity100 against @entity101 , who has specifically targeted the prestigious invitation event title this season			1
@entity23 was awkwardly caught short without enough underwear before last night ’s @entity106 final			0
@entity0 also praised @entity26 and said younger players could learn from his attitude the 39 - year - old has endured a challenging week in @entity110 after breaking his ankle while running in @entity112 days before the event			1
after hobbling through his first match , a distracted @entity23 did his best to ease the pain as he slipped through the draw , going on to make a 147 in the last 16 against @entity117			0
but hours before the live @entity17 showdown against @entity119 , @entity23 had to rush in to a city packed with @entity122 shoppers on a mission to find some pants			0
‘ i only brought about five pairs , because with my ankle the way it was at the start i could n’t see myself going that far in the tournament , ’ admitted a sheepish @entity23			0
‘ so i have got to go into town , over to @entity132 or somewhere , to get myself some new ones for the final			0
’ an in - form @entity23 raced into a 5 - 1 first - session lead in the best - of - 19 frame @entity138 final , an event he has won four times			2
but @entity119 kept the match alive by reducing the arrears to 5 - 3 before the evening session .			0
