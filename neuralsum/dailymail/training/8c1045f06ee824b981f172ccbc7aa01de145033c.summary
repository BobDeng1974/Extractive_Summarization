the cynics insist we should never feel sorry for a coach with a long - term contract			1
it is a fine theory , but it did not survive the sight of @entity7 ’s face on saturday night			1
@entity9 , drawn , faintly desperate , he looked like a man who sees a wretched row of sleepless nights stretching before him			0
he was correct and courteous , since that is his nature			0
he was impeccably loyal to his team , since that is his obligation			0
but after @entity19 ’s fifth defeat in succession , he knew precisely what @entity21 was saying as the first pints went down			1
and he knew he would not emerge well from the beery inquest			0
he clutched at the ‘ positives ’ , aware that the word itself rang emptily after this latest reversal			2
he said he was ‘ frustrated to have got so close ’			0
he said that @entity19 had ‘ enjoyed a lot of ball ’ , they had ‘ generated good momentum ’ in the second half , they had ‘ played a lot of constructive rugby ’			1
and that was about it			0
@entity37 celebrate the only try of the first half which came from an intercept by @entity41 @entity19 coach @entity7 defended his team after they suffered their fifth straight defeat of more consequence were his more reflective observations			1
he said he had ‘ learned about who can and who ca n’t deliver ’ and repeatedly he stressed the need for @entity19 to be ‘ smarter ’ , especially if they ever hope to beat the likes of @entity50 and @entity37 , ‘ the top two sides in the world ’			1
no coach enjoys facing the world after a string of defeats , and @entity57 is no exception			2
he knows that the pressure on him will certainly increase in the 11 months or so before the @entity60			0
and , deep down and unspoken , he must suspect that his squad has not improved ; indeed , it may even have deteriorated			0
expectations will be great , because they always are , but the notion that @entity19 might finish at the top of the heap seems thoroughly fanciful at the moment			1
@entity19 assembled the kind of performance which pushes the sanest coaches towards neurosis			1
careless to the point of sloppiness , with shoddy handling and sterile strategy , they frequently resembled those @entity19 sides of old , who rejected wit and creation in favour of the muscularity of the night - club bouncer			1
@entity37 centre @entity41 runs away for the first try after intercepting the pass of @entity85 a week ago against @entity50 , albeit in defeat , they did sufficient to provide the encouragement of which @entity7 spoke			1
on saturday , the mood had evaporated			2
the @entity91 crowd traditionally waits for the home side to deserve its support			1
on saturday , it withheld it until the cause was effectively lost			1
until then , @entity21 had been diverted by extraneous issues			0
why do they think it necessary to flood the field with soldiers , sailors and airmen ? i counted 61 service personnel in the pre-match ceremonies on saturday , but there could have been more			2
this was , after all , an autumn international , not the @entity110			0
and why do they make poor @entity112 sing the national anthem wearing a flimsy , red evening gown in the chill november drizzle ? the distractions were understandable			0
the @entity50 game was conducted against a background of seething excitement			0
on saturday , the mood was listless , slumberous , vapid			0
@entity37 were no better than they had to be ; similarly muscular in approach , but constructing counter-attacks with real speed and invention , and finishing them without mercy			1
and whenever the @entity37 felt themselves under threat , they could usually rely upon an @entity131 handing error - all too often from @entity132 - to provide their relief			1
@entity19 captain @entity134 looked devastated after the final whistle as @entity19 were beaten again the try they organised at the start of the second half was , by some distance , the best thing in the entire game			1
there was @entity147 ’s elegant chip beyond @entity131 cover , there was @entity149 , striding on to clutch the ball from the air and making swiftly adequate ground , there was his subtle off - load to @entity154 , and there was the controlled sprint to the line , culminating in a sprawl without a white shirt in sight			1
it was quite glorious , and the fact that it carried them to a 20 - 6 advantage seemed to have concluded the argument			0
it was here that @entity19 found what slender satisfaction they could take from the match			2
the rumbling , rolling drives made immoderate , unstoppable yardage , and with first @entity176 , then @entity175 taking their tries , an unlikely equality was achieved			0
but the flame was quickly extinguished , helped in no small measure by the crudely destructive impulse of @entity19 ’s hooker @entity181			2
@entity37 came out on top 31 - 28 at @entity91 on saturday to inflict another defeat on @entity19 he appeared to consider carefully the position of his feet when @entity186 lay on the floor			1
@entity181 stamped down on the no 8 ’s knee , and then had the nerve to shake his head when he was packed off with a yellow card			0
@entity7 would mention lapses of discipline			2
@entity181 should be in no doubt about the coach ’s target			0
@entity19 finished with earnest endeavour			2
they showed their expected character , but the @entity37 showed class , lifting their game just as @entity50 had done			2
it was enough to come through , by a tiny margin yet with something to spare			0
and @entity7 was left to speak of the ‘ learning process ’ , to stress once more that @entity19 had just played the two best teams they could find , and to promise changes for @entity208 next week			1
he would not have thanked us for our sympathy , but he had it just the same .			0

@entity19 lost 31 - 28 to @entity37 at @entity91 on saturday
head coach @entity7 forced to clutch at ' positives ' after
he was angry with his sides *indiscipline* but insists they will get better
