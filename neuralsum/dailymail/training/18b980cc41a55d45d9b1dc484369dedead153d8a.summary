an @entity1 journalist who spent more than a year behind bars in @entity3 on terror - related charges has been joyfully reunited with his family			1
pictures emerged on @entity7 smiling happily with his wife , @entity9 , and their three children			1
@entity12 's colleague tweeted a picture of them together with the message ' family reunion after 411 days ' , while another image of them was simply captioned ' finally ! ' @entity12 's wife had given birth to their third child , @entity21 , without her husband by her side			1
they had been held on terror related charges denounced as a sham by rights groups and the international community			1
they have been released pending a retrial			0
human rights lawyer @entity42 welcomed the decision by an @entity3 judge to order their release on bail			2
the wife of @entity50 actor @entity49 said she was ' encouraged ' by the ruling in relation to @entity32 , who she had acted for , and @entity12			1
the pair were sentenced with their colleague @entity55 to at least seven years in prison			0
@entity55 was freed two weeks ago and deported to his home - country , @entity59			0
now that he is out , @entity32 's next court hearing is due on february 23 and he has to check in at a police station every day until then			2
@entity42 , the international human rights lawyer , is representing the journalists thursday 's decision indicated the court was moving ahead with a retrial of @entity32 and @entity12 , but several scenarios are possible			1
the court could eventually throw out the case , acquit them , convict them but sentence them to time served , or impose more prison time , with the possibility of a pardon from president @entity75			0
like @entity55 , @entity32 could also be deported but prospects for @entity77 , who only has @entity3 citizenship , remain murkier			1
@entity79 has signaled it wants to resolve the case and end the criticism ahead of a major economic conference next month to drum up international investment			0
@entity3 's staggered parliamentary elections are also due to start in march			2
the three journalists , who worked for @entity1 's @entity86 - language channel , were arrested in december 2013 and accused of belonging to the @entity87 , which was branded a terrorist organization after the military ousted president @entity90 earlier that year			1
since the ouster , @entity3 has been cracking down heavily on @entity90 's supporters , and the journalists were accused of being mouthpieces for the @entity87 and falsifying footage to suggest that @entity3 faces civil war			1
they rejected the charges against them , saying they were simply reporting the news			0
they were convicted by a lower court on terrorism - related charges and sentenced to at least seven years in prison			1
the @entity107 , the country 's highest appeals court , said in ordering a retrial that their conviction was based on ' flawed evidence ' and that the trial was marred by violations of the defendants ' rights , according to details of its ruling made public this week			0
@entity1 called the decision ' a small step in the right direction ' but said the court should dismiss ' this absurd case ' and release both journalists unconditionally			2
' though @entity127 had rejected calls from the @entity129 and other @entity131 governments to pardon or commute the sentences , he acknowledged last july that the heavy sentences had a ' very negative ' impact on @entity3 's reputation and that he wished they had never been put on trial			2
the journalists and their families say they were caught in the bitter feud between @entity3 and @entity140 , the @entity142 nation that owns @entity1 and a main @entity87 backer			1
@entity3 's ties with @entity140 have since thawed			2
@entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( centre ) and @entity59 journalist @entity55 ( right ) on the first day of their trial @entity55 was deported under a hastily drawn up law allowing @entity127 to deport foreigners who are on trial or have been convicted			0
@entity32 has applied for deportation under the same law , which is confusing and unclear			2
one defense lawyer , @entity155 , noted that @entity55 remains listed as a defendant in the case even after his deportation			0
@entity32 has said that security officials pushed him into giving up his @entity3 citizenship so he could be sent to @entity33 , where he also has citizenship			1
' i did n't ask to give up my @entity3 citizenship			2
i was asked to do so , ' @entity32 said in the courtroom thursday , wearing a sling on a shoulder that has been injured since before his arrest and only worsened in detention			0
he said security officials had asked him to do so because the case had become a ' nightmare ' for @entity3			0
@entity33 prime minister @entity172 said thursday that his government was in touch with officials in @entity3 ' at all levels , including on my level , ' and was continuing to press for @entity32 's freedom			1
' we do remain optimistic that this case will be resolved , ' @entity172 said			0
@entity12 and 11 other defendants in the case - mostly students accused of being @entity87 members - were ordered released without bail			1
from @entity59 , @entity55 expressed his joy but said it was too soon for unreserved celebrations			0
' the trial is ongoing , and nobody has yet been acquitted , ' @entity55 said in a statement			0
' i 'm looking forward to the day when the court declares all of us innocent of the charges			0
then the party will really begin			0
