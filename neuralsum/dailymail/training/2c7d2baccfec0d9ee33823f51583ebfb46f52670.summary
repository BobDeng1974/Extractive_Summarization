by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 31 october 2012 nine new species of colourful , tree - climbing tarantulas have been discovered in @entity3 , including four from a mysterious , ancient genus once thought to have been extinct			1
the finds highlight how little is still known about the fauna of the @entity3 @entity6 , a habitat which is under serious threat from human encroachment			1
' instead of the seven species formerly known in the region , we now have sixteen ' , said dr @entity12 , a tarantula specialist at the @entity14 in @entity15 , who carried out the study			1
pretty in pink : this shows the newly found @entity20 , from the @entity3 @entity6 mountain range in the state of @entity23 , @entity3 the so - called arboreal tarantulas are known from a few tropical places in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 and the @entity30			1
they generally have a lighter build , thinner bodies and longer legs than other kinds of tarantulas , which makes them better suited for their habitat			1
increased surface area at the ends of their legs makes them better equipped to clamber across different surfaces , while their light build makes them more agile			2
their core area is the @entity49 , from where most of the species are known and normally very common , living in the jungle or even in domestic surroundings			2
' resurrected genus ' : a @entity55 costae specimen from from @entity3 cerrado in the state of @entity59			1
spiders of this genus are the smallest arboreal tarantulas in the world highlander : a specimen of the newly discovered @entity66 , which was found living inside bromeliads at the top of table mountains where trees are rare dr @entity12 's findings have been published in the open - access journal @entity74 , where he has described how four of the new discoveries belong to the @entity77 genus that had once thought to be extinct			1
whether it 's a shark or a tiny spider , there are many things out there that scare us			2
but we may not be in as much danger as we think as our fears can make objects seem much closer than they actually are			2
for fear can skew our perception of approaching objects , causing us to underestimate the distance of a threatening one , according to researchers from @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 , and the @entity96			2
the findings , published in @entity98 , show that emotion and perception are subtly intertwined in the mind			0
' in a resurrected genus with a mysterious single species known from 1841 , we have now five species , ' he said			0
' these are the smallest arboreal tarantulas in the world , and their analysis suggests the genus to be very old , so they can be considered relicts of a formerly more widely distributed taxon '			0
other discoveries include new species , @entity114 , which lives inside bromeliads , a type of flowering plant which often contains water in overlapping leaf bases			0
' only a single species had been known to live exclusively inside these plants , and now we have another that specialized in bromeliads as well , ' dr @entity12 said			0
a further species , @entity126 , was found living inside the same kinds of plants at the top of table mountains where trees are rare			0
' this species also inhabits bromeliads , one of the few places for an arboreal tarantula to live that offer water and a retreat against the intense sunlight ' he said			0
the discovery of all these new species outside the @entity49 was unexpected and illustrates how little we know of the fauna surrounding us , even from hot spots of threatened biodiversity like the @entity3 @entity6 and the @entity144 ( a kind of savannah vegetation )			1
these species are highly endemic and the regions where they live are suffering high pressure from human activities , according to the research			0
worse still , all these new species are colourful , which could attract the interest for capturing them for the pet trade , constituting another threat .			0

all discovered in the @entity3 @entity6 *rainforest* or *nearby* *grasslands*
finds illustrate how little we know about fauna in that biodiversity hot spot
