not many people would appreciate a kick to the face from an opponent , let alone offer to shake their hand afterwards ... unless that opponent is @entity7 , of course			0
during a clash between @entity11 's @entity10 and @entity12 in the @entity13 on friday night - which @entity10 won 3 - 2 - @entity15 was left seeing stars ; but it was n't because he was in awe of the @entity21 @entity20 winning hero			1
half - way through the first half , @entity15 and the former @entity23 and @entity24 midfielder challenged for a high ball			2
@entity7 goes in high on @entity12 opponent @entity15 in their @entity13 clash on friday night the @entity21 star sticks the boot in for @entity10 , with whom he signed a two - year contract in september the referee awarded @entity12 the foul , but did n't deem it necessary to book @entity7 after the incident rather than using his head , @entity7 went in high with his boot , leathering the poor @entity12 player in the face interestingly enough @entity15 offered a truce with the culprit , who was not punished for his offence			1
although the @entity45 star was n't on the scoresheet that night , his side were victorious with an injury time winner .			0
