@entity0 has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride - free water health minister @entity3 has slammed celebrity chef @entity0 for promoting fluoride - free water , saying he is putting people 's health at risk with his extreme views on diet and lifestyle			1
it comes after concerned medical professionals described @entity0 ' standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice after he revealed his family also steers clear of consuming @entity16 tap water			1
ms @entity3 said she was ' highly disappointed ' to see the @entity18 judge use his power as a high profile media personality to influence in areas he had no expertise , in which she has refused to watch his reality cooking show			1
' here we are spending a lot of effort and energy in educating people about the value of fluoridation , about the fact that there are no risks associated with ­ vaccination , or very low risks , and that there is no connection between vaccination and autism , and it is countered by a celebrity who knows nothing from a specialist point of view , ' she told @entity44			2
' i 'm highly disappointed that they would use a platform of cooking			0
that is totally inappropriate and quite disturbing , which is why i wo n't watch those programs anymore			0
' @entity0 ' has responded to the health minister 's concerns , saying he would like to discuss the benefits of water fluoridation			1
' i welcome the opportunity to ­ discuss the value of fluoridation with ms @entity3 , but ask that she , or any other party , does not misrepresent my views , opinions or beliefs			2
' the revelation follows after @entity0 threw his weight behind an anti-fluoride campaign where he proudly wore a ' @entity68 ' t - shirt on @entity69 to promote the @entity72 - based lobby group 's cause			1
health minister @entity3 has slammed celebrity chef @entity0 for promoting fluoride - free water @entity0 has also been under fire for endorsing the @entity76 diet which cuts out dairy , cereal and processed meats some slogans on the @entity81 that @entity0 is a passionate advocate for ' alkalised water ( maybe i just should 've just said filtered water ? ) - we have a portable mineral pot ( $ 500 ) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens ( chorine , chemicals , bacteria etc ) , ' he said in a post on his @entity69 page			1
@entity0 and his family do n't drink tap water ' i realise there 's plenty of controversy around alkalised water , but i would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water , as it works out cheaper in the long run , and is environmentally friendly			2
' @entity107 @entity106 president @entity105 hit back at the outspoken chef telling @entity109 that @entity0 needed to stick to what he does best			2
' all evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities , the @entity114 , and by the @entity115 points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay , ' dr @entity105 said			1
' celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the @entity126			0
' ' people like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking			2
' @entity0 has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial @entity76 diet , which his family abides by , that includes meat , fish , vegetables , and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food			0
' i 'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because i choose to eat and feed my family what i believe to be a nutrient dense diet , ' he said on his @entity69 page			0
' i ca n't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive ? ' he says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that ' ignorance is not bliss '			0
' i 'm a father and i take that privilege very seriously , so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible , so that i can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end , is the ultimate goal , ' he posted			0
@entity0 ( left ) says his role as a father is to strive for optimum health for his children the @entity18 judge ( pictured with fellow judge @entity172 left ) thinks it is bizarre that some people find his food choices so offensive however , dr @entity105 sees @entity0 ' stance as abusing his high profile media personality			1
' it is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time - poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts , he said			0
' it affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well - being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society			0
