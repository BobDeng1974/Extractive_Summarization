by @entity0 a camera lost in a shipwreck two years ago off the coast of @entity4 has been recovered - and the memories it contains are miraculously intact			1
two students diving near @entity8 found the camera 40 feet underwater while diving for starfish as part of their research project			1
one of them picked up the rusty , crusted camera , unaware of how long the device had been underwater			0
lost at sea : the camera was lost in a shipwreck two years ago ' one of them picked it up and put it in his pocket and kept counting the starfish , ' one of the professors overseeing the dive told @entity28			1
' when they came up from the dive , he said , " look what i found			0
" ' @entity33 says she were fascinated by the many small marine creatures that had taken up residence in the camera			0
the first thought professor @entity38 had , however , was whether or not there were still photographs on it			0
she opened the device and found a memory card			1
' i cleaned the contacts off of the ( memory card ) put it in my computer and it worked , ' she told the @entity49 they made posters of the video and tacked them up in the area in an effort to find the camera 's owners , and lo and behold , a member of the @entity58 recogized one of the men in a cheery group shot			1
intact : unbelievably , the memory card still held all @entity64 's precious family photographs memories : @entity64 ( center , back ) was recognized by a @entity58 who had rescued him when his ship @entity68 sank of the coast of @entity4 the man was @entity64 , a @entity4 artist who had been rescued by the @entity58 two years earlier when the ship he was on , @entity68 , sank on a 500 - kilometre voyage from @entity4 to his summer home in @entity74 , @entity75 ' that just shocked me , ' @entity64 told @entity78			1
' getting the camera , or the photos back , that 's really quite wonderful			0
' when the ship went down , not only did @entity64 lose his camera in the wreck , but precious memories it contained			1
the last pictures he had taken was a family gathering to scatter his parents ashes at @entity89 in @entity90			2
repurposed : while the camera will no longer perform its original function , it has proven to be a popular home for marine life ' i have a new respect for , you know , these electronics , ' @entity64 told @entity78			2
' you throw most of it away every two years , but that little card is an amazing bit of technology			0
' another item on the card is a video of calm seas that @entity64 took just before his ship was wrecked			2
one of @entity38 's acquaintances from the @entity58 station had personally attended the @entity64 's rescue , and was able to dig out his contact details			2
he left a message for @entity64 , who called @entity38 the following day			0
he says when he got off the phone with the @entity58 him and his wife were laughing a great deal and mentioned how lucky he was , ' she told the @entity49			0
