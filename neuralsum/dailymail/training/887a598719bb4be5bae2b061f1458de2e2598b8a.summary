4d scans are a highly developed form of traditional ultrasound where very high frequency sound waves are used to produce images of what is inside the body			0
as with older forms of ultra-sound , sound waves a emitted from a transducer , or probe , which is placed on the mother 's abdomen and then moved to ' look at ' areas in the uterus			1
these sound waves bounce back off the foetus , helping to create a ' picture ' of the child on a screen			0
4d scans use the same frequency of sound waves as in a normal ultrasound			0
but the sound waves are directed from many more angles , producing a ' real - time ' video of the foetus as it moves and allowing scientists to say the images are in four dimensions .			0
