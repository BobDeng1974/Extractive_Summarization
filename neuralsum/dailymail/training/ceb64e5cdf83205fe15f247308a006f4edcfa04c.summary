an @entity1 plane sparked panic on the ground after it was spotted circling in the sky above @entity6 airport for two hours with an @entity8 jet in tow on tuesday			1
the budget airline 's @entity10 was seen by observers who took to @entity13 to highlight its unusual flight pattern - and fears were raised when a @entity16 was seen flying a similar route			2
however , a spokesman for @entity19 confirmed the two aircraft were both taking part in training exercises on the same day			2
an @entity1 plane was on a ' training course ' when it was spotted circling for some two hours ( file photo ) members of the public began to worry when an @entity29 jet was also spotted circling the airspace ' we had a crew training flights that departed from @entity19 , which will have gone up , come down , gone up and come down again , ' the spokesman told @entity34			1
' it 's not unusual and we have these very often in fact there was one that has been out today ( tuesday )			0
' because of the wind direction , the flights went out on a slightly different path , which was more over south @entity6 , and this meant that more people noticed it			0
' and then purely by coincidence , an @entity29 was out on a training exercise and was in the same area			0
people were putting two and two together and getting five			0
' a member of public , @entity49 , also contacted the @entity51 after he saw the @entity1 plane performing ' evasive manoeuvres ' with its landing gear down over @entity55 from about 11.30am			1
' locals took to @entity13 after seeing both planes in the sky for up to two hours			2
the map shows the number of times the @entity1 plane circled over @entity19 the circling of the @entity1 plane began to stir up questioning on twitter while @entity65 wrote : ' there 's been an @entity1 plane and a @entity8 fighter circling @entity6 all day and it kept flying right over our school like so low it was crazy			1
' @entity71 posted : ' that @entity1 plane is still flying round and round in circles ! that 's one long training course they 're on ! # @entity6			1
' a spokesman for @entity1 said : ' @entity1 has been conducting routine crew training flights in the @entity80 which are set to continue for the rest of the week			2
officials at @entity19 have said that the plane will be ' in training ' for a few days ' our pilots are always fully aware of other aircraft operating safely in the vicinity			1
at no point was there any risk whatsoever to either aircraft			0
' the airline has a comprehensive training programme for its pilots and as part of this conducts numerous flights of this kind every year			0
' however , members of the public seemed to believe this was far less ' normal ' than suggested			0
writing on @entity103 said : ' anyone know why the plane is circling ? counted at least 15 times in the past 2 hours			0
and @entity107 was similarly confused , writing : ' sat for about 4 hours watching an easyjet plane circle @entity6 airport ! ' @entity110 added : ' the plane circling @entity19 is crew training			1
