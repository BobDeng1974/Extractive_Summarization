councils are being forced to slash millions from school maintenance budgets to pay for @entity4 ’s controversial plan to provide free school meals to all infant children , a report warns today			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) says that councils will be left more than £ 25million out of pocket as a result of the policy championed by the @entity12 leader			1
the @entity7 report also warns that the plan , which comes into force next month , could have an impact on learning in some schools because lunch times may have to be extended to cope with demand , leaving less time for lessons			1
a @entity12 spokesman said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority @entity26 , the chairman of the @entity7 ’s children and young people board , said that while free school meals could have benefits for children , councils were being forced to raid other parts of the schools budget to pay for them			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ councils and schools have been working really hard to make this happen within this ambitious timescale			2
but it can not be right that for some councils , money set aside for maintenance has instead had to be spent plugging the shortfall in money which government should have provided for meals			2
deputy prime minister @entity4 's controversial plan to provide free school meals to all infant children means councils are being forced to slash millions from school maintenance budgets to pay for it ‘ this research makes it clear central government has not provided schools with enough money to do the essential work necessary to give 1.5 million children a free meal at lunchtime			1
it is councils and schools who are picking up the bill for this work , at a time when budgets are already squeezed and tough decisions are being taken			0
’ a survey of 150 major local authorities found that half of those responding had been forced to subsidise the free school meal programme			1
the average bill was just under £ 500,000			0
councils responding to the survey reported spending £ 25.8million of their own cash to prepare for the introduction of the policy at the start of the new school year			2
but the true figure is likely to be far higher as only half of those contacted responded to the survey			0
church schools , which have to fund 10 per cent of all capital projects from their own funds , are said to have been hit particularly hard			0
the findings will fuel criticism of mr @entity4 for pressing ahead with the eye - catching announcement at last year ’s @entity12 conference before detailed work had been done on the practicalities and likely costs			2
a survey of 150 major local authorities found that half of those responding had been forced to subsidise the free school meal programme the decision led to a furious row with the then education secretary @entity100 who was charged with trying to make the policy work			1
aides to mr @entity100 said mr @entity4 pressed ahead with the plan despite warnings it was unaffordable			0
@entity107 ’s education spokesman @entity106 said : ‘ hard - pressed schools and councils are being forced to bail out the government because of its own incompetence			0
@entity4 announced the policy without doing the maths first			0
’ a total of £ 150million was set aside to pay for improvements such as new kitchens and extended dining areas			0
but councils have warned the money underestimated the true cost			0
today ’s report warns that despite the extra spending some schools will only be able to provide packed lunches and others will be forced to deploy portable kitchens			0
a @entity12 spokesman said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority			1
he said : ‘ free school meals are good for children ’s attainment , make sure they eat more healthy food , and will save parents money			1
that ’s why the @entity12 are proud to be delivering them in government and we believe councils should prioritise them too			2

@entity7 says councils will be left more than £ 25m out of pocket because of the policy
@entity12 said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority
added policy will save parents money and make sure children eat healthily
@entity159 may have to be extended to cope with demand for food
