there can be few sights more welcome first thing in the morning than a turquoise sea , a white sandy beach and palm trees swaying in the wind			0
at @entity10 's @entity9 resort - on the eastern , @entity12 side of the @entity13 in the south east of @entity15 - you 're greeted by this sight every morning			1
the resort is on its own beautiful stretch of beach , protected from some of the fiercer waves you get further down the coast , and the wind is more of a breeze			0
come on in , the water 's lovely : the @entity9 resort sits on @entity15 's @entity12 coast , on the @entity29 @entity31 - topped cabanas dotted across the sand provide the ultimate way to while away the day , either in the shade or on a lounger just in front of it			1
as you relax in the cabana , all that lies between your feet and the sparkling water is a few yards of perfectly manicured sand			0
the first thing that strikes you when you arrive at the resort , on the @entity29 , is the abundance of pools			2
there are three main ones and a series of ' swim - up ' pools attached to some rooms , which mean you can laze in the water without having to leave your accommodation			1
each room also has its own @entity58 , perfect for an evening drink as the sun sets - or , as my friend @entity61 and i discovered during a rare cloudy period , ideal for sitting in and reading a book			2
one of the pools is definitely geared towards those who want to take advantage of the array of cocktails on offer as part of the all - inclusive deal			2
making a splash : the resort has a series of pools - including swimming options on your room 's very doorstep though the resort is quiet during the day and even the night time , if you do fancy a daytime drink , this is the place to do it			1
there 's a swim - up bar and the friendly bar men will fix up anything			1
for some inexplicable reason , @entity89 seemed to be the most popular drink while i was there - not my first choice in @entity96 weather , but what do i know ? the occasional cocktail aside , our daily routine at @entity9 was pretty much set in stone			1
the day kicked off with breakfast at one of the six restaurants			0
the buffet had everything you could want in gargantuan amounts : continental and cooked , and unlimited fruit and fresh juice meant you were definitely full until lunchtime			0
one of the best things about being in an all - inclusive is that you do n't have to carry anything around with you			0
the restaurant staff simply take your room number and you can eat and drink as much as you like			0
change of pace : the resort offers plenty of room for relaxation - but @entity122 was not sure about the @entity123 there are lots of choices when it comes to the food			2
there are @entity133 , @entity131 , @entity12 and @entity132 restaurants and also fine - dining at @entity134 , the only one where you need to make a booking , and it is n't included in the all - inclusive deal			2
we 'd become so used to our routine of relaxation and eating that we really did n't want to go home			0
but it was only a short journey to @entity145 airport , and stepping on to a new @entity146 made the end just about bearable			1
@entity10 ( www.thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555 ) offers 11 nights at the @entity15 on an all - inclusive basis from Â£ 1,728 per person			1
this includes return flights from @entity154 on april 16 , 2015 .			0
