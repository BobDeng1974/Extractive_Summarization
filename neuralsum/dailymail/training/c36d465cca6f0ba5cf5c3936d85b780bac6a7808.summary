by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 17:15 est , 8 june 2013 pecking order : prince @entity2 takes a keen interest in poultry on a visit to @entity6 in @entity7 as an eager environmentalist , prince @entity2 has always been keen to use his vast tracts of land to help foster some of the world ’s endangered species			1
now he is set to help save some rare chickens from extinction – but the crucial decision about which breeds to rescue could come down to one simple point : what colour eggs they lay			2
the prince is said to favour brown eggs , which he – like the @entity21 – believes taste better than white ones			1
that opinion has little basis in science , but it could sway his judgment when it comes to choosing vulnerable breeds to add to his collection at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
experts from the @entity33 have been asked to draw up a shortlist of hen types for @entity2 to consider , and will include details of their eggshells in their brief			1
@entity38 , chairman of the trust , said : ‘ the prince is a staunch supporter of rare breeds			2
he wishes to build up hen numbers and thought it was fitting to choose rare breeds			1
i will write some notes about each breed and the colour of their eggs and the @entity40 can choose for himself			1
‘ i was told he likes to eat brown eggs but i am going to suggest the breeds that need most help and not worry about the eggs			0
’ the colour of a breed ’s egg is genetically determined , and , contrary to popular opinion , has nothing to do with diet – which is what affects the taste			1
a bright yolk is linked to a hen eating lots of cabbage and foraging freely on grass			2
the @entity40 already keeps a small number of hens at @entity30 , including @entity71 and @entity72 , which supply dark speckled eggs to the royal household			1
now he wants to add more , both for their eggs and to help incubate chicks of rarer breeds			0
candidates for inclusion in the royal grounds include the @entity81 , one of the rarest breeds in @entity84 , with fewer than 50 breeding hens surviving			2
these tall , black - feathered birds – which do lay brown eggs – were originally imported from @entity88 in 1872 , but fell out of fashion during the 1930s			0
another contender is the @entity92 , a large black and white hen that was developed in the @entity94			2
today there are fewer than 100 breeding hens in the country			1
it also lays a brown egg , though it may be too pale for the @entity40 ’s taste			1
@entity101 of mr @entity38 ’s list , however , is the @entity103 , of which there are just a handful in @entity84			0
this is a striking white - faced , shiny black - feathered hen , which has a long wattle – the flap of skin hanging from its neck – and resembles a bearded old man			0
but it produces large , white eggs			0
mr @entity38 said : ‘ this breed needs a lot of help and hopefully the @entity40 will agree to them			0
we know he wants to develop the breeding side			0
‘ we expect him to start with a trio of each breed he chooses , two hens and a cockerel			0
each breed needs be kept separately and the cockerels must be segregated from the hens			0
’ poultry numbers : the @entity129 ( left ) is becoming very rare and there are fewer than 50 @entity132 hens ( right ) surviving in the @entity84 laying low : the @entity133 ( left ) lays brown eggs so could be a favourite for @entity2			1
there are fewer than 100 breeding @entity92 hens ( right ) left in the @entity84 another breed at risk is the @entity129 , which has existed in @entity140 for 200 years but is now very rare , and lays a tinted white egg			2
the prince , who is patron of the @entity33 , may also be attracted to the @entity143 , which was created by a @entity146 breeder during the @entity147 and which lays a distinctive terracotta egg			1
there is also the @entity151 , which was developed by a @entity153 breeder in 1950 and also lays brown eggs			0
the prince has long been lampooned for being fussy about boiled eggs , with reports he was served seven each day to make sure there was a perfect one			0
but the claim , first made by @entity160 in his 2006 book on royalty , was last year rubbished as ‘ totally untrue ’ by @entity162 .			0
