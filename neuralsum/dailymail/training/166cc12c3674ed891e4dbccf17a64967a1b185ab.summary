but @entity10 is said to have hated the subject that he made his name shooting with his trusty 35mm camera			2
the photographer , who would have been 100 this week , was there when @entity17 troops stormed the beach at @entity19 in 1944 , and witnessed the brutal civil war that ripped apart @entity21 for much of the later 1930s			1

@entity10 would have been 100 this week welcoming : this picture of civilians lining the streets of @entity28 just outside @entity29 , @entity30 , was taken in july 1943 joint effort : in @entity37 in 1944 following the entry of the @entity36 , numerous pockets of @entity34 snipers had to be rooted out - many civilians joined troops in the fighting pow : a @entity34 soldier after he had been captured by @entity44 troops near @entity45 in july 1943 he was on hand to chronicle some of the most important moments in world history in the last century and his photos of the @entity51 landings in particular offer the most vivid depiction of the bloody but crucial invasion of @entity54			1
@entity10 was born @entity55 in @entity57 capital @entity58 in 1913 but moved to @entity59 when he was 17 enrolling in the @entity60 where he studied journalism and political science while working part time in a dark room			2
he remained in @entity59 until @entity64 was appointed chancellor of germany in 1933 and the rise of the @entity67 gained pace , moving to @entity37			0
along with his companion @entity69 , @entity10 made regular trips to @entity21 between 1936 and 1939 to photograph the @entity71			1
during that time he took arguably his most famous photograph - death of a loyalist soldier - which graphically depicted the death of anarchist @entity76			2

the @entity105 described him as the ' greatest war photographer in the world ' later the same year			0

from 1941 until 1946 , @entity10 was war correspondent for @entity109 and @entity112 and travelled with the @entity113			1

the photographer became a casualty of war himself in 1954			2

he was posthumously awarded the @entity151 with @entity152 by the @entity54 and the @entity153 for excellence in the field of photojournalism was established the year after his death			0
@entity10 's 11 surviving close up photographs of the @entity19 beach landings on june 6 1944 earned the nickname the ' @entity161 ' but he had in fact taken 106 photographs while wading through the water			1
the images were sent to @entity109 's office in @entity81 where picture editor @entity167 told staff in the dark room to ' rush ! ' as they did the developing			0
in their haste , worker @entity171 shut the doors on a wooden locker where the film was drying and 95 of the images melted as the negatives were destroyed			0
iconic : one of @entity10 's 11 surviving photos of @entity17 troops invading @entity181 in june 1944 three whole rolls were lost , and more than half of the @entity185 useless film was tossed in a dustbin that same night and lost forever			1
there were no other pictures taken from so close to the frontline landings on @entity51 so @entity190 provide the only enduring images from @entity181			0
he later wrote in his book , called slightly out of @entity194 : ' the men from my barge waded in the water			0
waist - deep , with rifles ready to shoot , with the invasion obstacles and the smoking beach in the background gangplank to take my first real picture of the invasion			2
' the boatswain , who was in an understandable hurry to get the hell out of there , mistook my picture - taking attitude for explicable hesitation , and helped me make up my mind with a well - aimed kick in the rear			0
the water was cold , and the beach still more than a hundred yards away			0
' he dived for cover behind a steel object before heading onward in the water for a disabled @entity44 tank as he snapped away furiously			0
the photographer held his camera high above his head to stop his precious film being damaged and later ran towards an incoming landing craft			0
he was hauled aboard and spirited away to @entity226 where most of his shots were inadvertently destroyed in the developing room .			0
