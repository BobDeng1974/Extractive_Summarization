according to ancient texts , the @entity0 boasted elaborate terraces , magnificent water features and floating plants			1
the decadent grounds are reputed to have been built in the @entity6 of @entity7 - yet for centuries no - one has been able to find any physical evidence they existed			1
however , according to one expert , closer analysis of these texts - along with clues on display at the @entity15 - suggest that this may be because archaeologists have been searching in the wrong place			1
for centuries , historians believed the @entity0 were built in @entity6 , @entity7 by @entity21			1
closer analysis of these ancient texts have led researchers to believe it was actually built 350 miles away in the city of @entity25 , pictured , by @entity26 according to dr @entity28 from @entity29 , the gardens are actually buried in the ancient city of @entity25 , near modern - day @entity31 , 350 miles away in northern @entity7			1
dr @entity28 from the university ’s @entity34 has spent the past 20 years researching the location of the gardens , referred to by some as a myth due to the lack of physical evidence			0
they were believed to have been built around 600 @entity42 , although this date was taken from ancient texts written hundreds of years after they were said to have been created			1
one text specifically claimed the gardens were built by @entity47 in the @entity6 of @entity7 for his wife @entity48			1
yet there was no mention of them in any text written by the emperor or his wife			0
this led dr @entity28 to study these texts more closely and during her research she discovered a prism at the @entity15 in @entity60 covered in cuneiform writing			0
for centuries , the @entity0 were thought to have been built in the ancient @entity7 city of @entity64 , because of the name			1
this location led people to believe it was built by the @entity68 who lived around 600 bc. since this time , archaeologists and historians have scoured the location of the ancient city but have been unable to find any physical evidence they existed - leading some to believe the gardens are a myth			1
it is one of the @entity78 and was called the @entity0 because they were supposedly built high above the ground on split - level stone terraces			1
some texts referred to the plants in the gardens as ‘ floating ’ but they were believed , instead , to have hung from these different terraces , giving them the appearance of being suspended in mid-air			2
a @entity89 historian named @entity90 described the gardens as being 400ft wide by 400ft long , with walls as high as 80ft			2
due to this height , water was said to have been transported from a lake at the bottom using a similar principle as @entity98 ’ screw – a pump that scoops up water in a spiral tube and carries it to the top			0
it was said to have been invented by @entity98 in the @entity104 yet if a similar system was used in the gardens , this would predate it by around 350 years			0
given the size , historians have estimated the gardens would have used 8,200 gallons of water a day to water the plants			0
some historians and archaeologists believe that the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion , while others believe an earthquake destroyed them			0
cuneiform is an ancient language dating back to the @entity120 era , that was also used by the @entity123 empires			1
the prism contains details of a king called @entity127 who was leader of the @entity123 empire and lived a century before @entity68			1
the writing included references to a palace built near the @entity123 capital of @entity25 as well as a garden he called ‘ wonder for all people			1
’ @entity127 ’s grandson @entity136 was also said to have drawn an image of the garden on a panel in this palace			2
as one of the @entity141 , the gardens ( illustration pictured ) were called ' hanging ' because they were built high above the ground on split - level stone terraces			1
ancient texts referred to the plants in the gardens as ' floating ' but they were believed , instead , to have hung from these different terraces the gardens were believed to have been built in @entity64 because of its name			1
however , the @entity123 capital of @entity25 was known as @entity151 , and this may have been where the confusion arose			1
ancient texts written by @entity123 leader @entity127 made reference to a ' wonder ' garden during a @entity160 documentary called @entity64 ’s @entity0 , dr @entity28 was able to combine ancient maps with modern - day versions to locate what she believes to be the ruins of the palace			1
nearby she found a large mound of dirt sloping to a stretch of greenery which she claims is the ‘ best place ’ for the ancient site			0
she believes her claims are substantiated by a bas - relief , taken from @entity25 , that detailed the location of the palace alongside a garden with trees hanging from terraces			2
furthermore , dr @entity28 claimed in the documentary that @entity25 was also known as @entity151 and added this may be where the confusion came from			2
a @entity89 historian named @entity90 described the gardens as being 400ft wide by 400ft long , with walls as high as 80ft			2
during a @entity160 documentary called @entity64 's @entity0 , dr @entity28 , pictured right , was able to combine ancient text found on a prism at the @entity15 , pictured left , with ancient maps and modern - day versions to locate what she believes to be the ruins of the gardens the left - hand image shows emperor @entity68 overlooking what is thought to be the @entity0			1
however , new research claims it was built by @entity123 leader @entity127 , pictured right due to this height , water was said to have been transported from a lake at the bottom using a similar principle as @entity98 ’ screw – a pump that scoops up water in a spiral tube and carries it to the top			1
the pump was said to have been invented by @entity98 in the @entity104 yet if a similar system was used in the gardens , this would predate it by around 350 years			0
given the size , historians have estimated the gardens would have used 8,200 gallons of water a day to water the plants			0
some historians and archaeologists believe the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion , while others believe an earthquake destroyed them			0
dr @entity28 believes more research will need to be carried out before archaeologists can confirm the location fo the gardens			0
she said : ' more research is now required at the site , but sadly i do n’t think that will be possible in my lifetime			0
' my conviction that the gardens were in @entity25 remains unshaken			2
' the @entity141 is a list of ' must - see ' sights compiled for ancient @entity89 travellers in the eastern @entity231			2
the list was compiled in the @entity104 and was based on ancient texts and accounts of stunning structures across the region			2
the @entity237 is the only wonder from this list that still stands , while all of the others are thought to have been destroyed by earthquakes			0
@entity237 of @entity242 : built between 2584 and 2561 bc it is located in the @entity244 , @entity245			0
@entity246 claim the pyramid was built as a tomb for the @entity245 @entity249			2
the @entity0 : originally believed to have been built around 600 @entity42 near @entity252 , in the @entity6 of @entity7 , dr @entity28 's research pinpoints its whereabouts 350 miles north in the the ancient city of @entity25 , the capital of the @entity123 empire , also known as ' @entity151			1
' @entity255 at @entity256 : built c. 550 bc near @entity259 in the @entity260 of @entity261 , it was a @entity89 temple dedicated to the goddess @entity263			0
@entity264 : the temple was said to have been built between 466 and 456 bc while the statue itself was believed to have been added in 435 bc. @entity268 reports claim it was a giant seated figure , believed to be around 43 ft tall , built by the @entity89 sculptor @entity271			0
mausoleum at @entity272 : built in 351 bc in modern - day @entity274 , @entity261 , it was a tomb built for @entity276 , a governor from the @entity278			0

@entity283 : built around 280 bc in @entity285 , @entity245 it was tower said to be 450ft tall , making it one of the tallest man - made structures for many centuries .			0

@entity0 are one of the @entity141
they were 80ft high and featured elaborate terraces and floating plants
ancient texts claim they were built in the @entity7 city of @entity6 in @entity299
this lead many to believe @entity120 emperor @entity68 built them
yet closer analysis suggests they were built 350 miles in the @entity123 capital of @entity25 by @entity127
