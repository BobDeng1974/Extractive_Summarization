when it got down to the real nitty - gritty after @entity4 ’s training session in the @entity5 , @entity0 just could n’t commit			1
the brutal truth is that the country ’s head coach just is n’t mad about @entity9 any more			1
@entity0 went as far as to say that the @entity4 striker , with 90 caps and 38 goals , is ‘ a useful player ’ , but would n’t go any further			1
something has gone awry here			2
@entity0 hinted heavily at a switch to left wing for @entity9 and he was trialled in the position in a series of drills during their 90 - minute training session			1
‘ i ’m not saying if he ’s exceptional or not , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i have picked him because he is a very good player			2
‘ if i say yes he is exceptional or no i do n’t think he ’s exceptional i ’m wrong either way			2
he ’s a football player			0
’ this was tetchy , the kind of performance you would expect of @entity4 ’s head coach when something is troubling him			1
‘ i decide how i want to use @entity9 , ’ he added			1
‘ there is an obsession with @entity9 which i do n’t really share			1
‘ he can play centre forward , behind the centre forward and wide			2
' if he ’s done all that with @entity52 there is no reason why i ca n’t use him in those positions as well			0
' i look at the players at my disposal and decide what they need and what we need			0
then i expect them to do it			0
’ ready for business : @entity0 speaks to the media ahead of the friendly with @entity25 game face : @entity0 is enjoying his time in @entity24 as @entity4 prepare for the @entity68 it was a brutal assessment and it will be fascinating to see how @entity9 handles it today when he is pressed into action			1
no - one would deny that @entity9 , the only survivor from friday ’s disciplined 3 - 0 victory over @entity73 at @entity74 , needs games			1
the issue , as ever , is where he plays			0
he has repeated , many times over , that his favoured role for club and country is behind the main striker			1
it is no longer in his hands			0
@entity9 did ok against @entity73 , a steady six out of 10 playing behind @entity85 in an overall decent , effective performance			1
‘ the thinking behind @entity9 starting a second game is that he only played 60 minutes against @entity73 , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ he ’s recovering his match fitness			0
it will be to his advantage to play another game			2
’ passing game : @entity94 team - mates @entity95 ( right ) and @entity96 sharpen their skills close control : @entity99 and @entity100 ( right ) show off their ball skills fighting fit : @entity103 ( centre ) trained with the rest of the team after injury problems there are some other alarming features about this @entity4 team , notably the deployment of @entity112 at right back today			1
you have to feel for @entity112 because he was exceptional in @entity115 ’s midfield during their title run - in			0
he is not the type to make a fuss and there will be no complaints from him , but he did n’t get picked to play right back for @entity4			1
‘ he ’s got the qualities to play there and there may be moments at the @entity68 when we would like to use him there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s in the squad as a midfield player and that ’s where we see him mostly , but it will be interesting to see how he gets on at right back			0
’ @entity0 is sticking with his settled 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , but he has made 10 changes to the team for the clash with @entity25			1
he insists the absence of @entity96 from his starting line - up is no cause for alarm , despite what @entity0 described as ‘ a clamour ’ for him to be named in the team			0
talking a good game : @entity0 speaks with dr @entity144 and sir @entity145 at training keeping an eye on things : @entity0 takes training ahead of @entity4 's friendly with @entity25 there was an energy about @entity96 ’s performance when he came on as a substitute on friday and he lifted the @entity74 crowd with a fearless performance			1
‘ if i concentrate on where the clamour is i would be changing my team every minute , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ you do n’t have to have any doubts about how we feel about @entity96			0
we feel he ’s an exceptional player			0
’ there ’s that word again — the one @entity0 could n’t quite stretch to when it turned to @entity165 should be among the substitutes today as @entity0 takes a closer look at some of his alternatives in this 25 - man squad on the @entity172 leg			0
@entity173 is expected to play off @entity175 ’s new striker @entity174			2
it feels like a decent fit			0
‘ they will get their chance to show what they can do , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ @entity173 ’s here because i think he ’s a very good player			0
‘ he ’s more than capable , if selected for @entity4 , of doing a very good job for us			2
’ this is a big chance for the shadow squad to impress			0
after that , though , @entity9 is the man who really is on trial .			2

@entity9 set to start for @entity4 against @entity25 in @entity24
pressure *mounting* on @entity4 striker to be *dropped* ahead of @entity68
@entity9 set to play on the left wing and not in his favoured place in the hole
