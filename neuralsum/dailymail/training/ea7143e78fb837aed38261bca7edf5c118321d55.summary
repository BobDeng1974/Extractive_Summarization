two of @entity2 ’s most famous prisons are facing the axe			1
@entity4 – made famous by @entity6 ’s 1897 poem @entity5 , after he was held there – and @entity7 , opened in 1809 , are among five named by the @entity8			1
@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity4 are all to close by next march			1
@entity15 , made famous by @entity6 's 1897 poem @entity5 , has been earmarked for closure @entity7 , which belongs to the @entity17 , required ten years ' notice before it can be handed back they have room for a total of 1,400 inmates but are either too expensive to run or need ‘ substantial ’ investment , officials said			1
@entity7 , which belongs to the @entity17 , requires ten years ’ notice before it can be handed back			0
the @entity26 jail in @entity27 is to be converted into an immigration removal centre			0
a new 2,000 - place prison is to be built at @entity30 @entity31 the @entity26 in @entity27 , will be converted into an immigration removal centre with 600 spaces four of the prisons - @entity4 , @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 in @entity14 - will be shut next march , saving the taxpayer £ 30million			1
@entity37 leaders said the announcement was a huge blow to the 700 prison guards working there and could lead to ‘ severe overcrowding ’ elsewhere			1
the historic @entity15 has a memorial to @entity6 ( pictured ) between them , the four jails have room for 1,400 inmates			1
@entity7 - which is more than 200 years old and belongs to the @entity47 ’ @entity17 - requires ten - years ’ notice before it can be handed back			0
but the @entity8 wants to find a new use for the jail , which holds around 600 inmates and has its own museum , as quickly as possible			0
justice secretary @entity53 has given a commitment there will be no reduction in the overall size of the prison estate			1
yesterday he said work would start next summer on a new 2,000 - place ' super ' prison in @entity30 , north @entity61			2
the £ 250million jail is expected to become fully operational by late 2017 , creating 1,000 ' much - needed ' jobs , mr @entity53 said			0
feasibility work has also started on a second large prison to be built in the south east of @entity2 , most likely in west @entity66			2
move comes after the @entity8 announced plans for 2,000 - place ' super-prison ' in @entity61 ( pictured is artist 's impression ) but @entity73 general secretary @entity72 said that - with 1,800 staff having already lost their jobs in the last 18 months - the new closures could cause major problems			1
he warned : ‘ with the assaults going on and the violence going on , we are extremely concerned by the powder keg situation now in prisons and the severe overcrowding			0
' justice secretary @entity53 said the closures were part of ministry 's cost - saving measures in other moves , @entity89 in @entity90 will change function to hold male rather than female offenders and @entity96 @entity95 in @entity10 , will stop holding young offenders and will change to hold adult male prisoners			1
mr @entity53 said : ‘ this is the latest part of our plan to modernise our prisons , bring down costs , but to make sure that by the next election we still have access to more prison places than we inherited in 2010			2
’ the fresh closures come after it was announced in january that six prisons would shut and three jails would be partially closed as part of a far - reaching overhaul			2
the @entity8 also announced at the time that it would build four new ‘ mini-prisons ’ , known as house blocks , at @entity115 , @entity116 , the @entity117 and @entity118			0
the mini-prisons will hold up to 1,260 prisoners and will replace older , more expensive prison capacity			2
@entity122 , head of crime and justice at the think tank @entity125 , said : ‘ the government is right to be closing down old , @entity128 prisons that are grossly inefficient , poorly - located and ill - equipped to reduce reoffending			0
‘ the replacement of our worn - out estate with large , new hub prisons will deliver massive savings to the taxpayer and provide better opportunities for rehabilitation			0
’ @entity138 , director of the @entity139 , said : “ closing small local prisons and replacing them with super-sized jails will not reduce crime or make communities safer			0
‘ you can and should modernise the prison system without throwing taxpayers ’ money down the prison - building drain			0

@entity4 , @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity13 all earmarked for closure by next march
@entity4 was made famous by @entity6 's poem @entity5
