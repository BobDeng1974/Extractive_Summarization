at what age and stage do you finally give up on finding the ' perfect ' partner ? one study found the average woman will kiss 15 men , have two - long term relationships and have her heart broken twice before she finds the person she 'll settle down with			1
do you only ever date one ' type ' ? the more varied your dating habits and the more different types of people you know and go out with , the more chance you have of finding someone who will truly make you happy			1
look back at your last five relationships : have you just dated the same person , over and over and still not happy ? if this is you , do n't settle with the person you 're with			1
deliberately date someone who is completely different than what you 're used to and see how that makes you feel			1
what personality type are you ? how important is chemistry to you ? the kneejerk reaction is ' very ! ' and if you 're an intense person , hang out for someone you feel a strong , powerful connection with			2
feeling content with your partner should make you feel warm and fuzzy rather than anxious and nervous but if the word ' content ' makes you feel warm and fuzzy rather than ancient and anxious , it 's perfectly possible to click with someone and have a lovely time together without ever feeling the @entity59 version of ' chemistry ' with that person			2
controlled ' sensible ' relationships suit lots of people			1
if you 're quite happy being with your partner and it 's your friends telling you it 's not passionate enough , ignore them and stick with your instincts			2
are you settling or compromising ? there 's an enormous difference			2
in the first scenario , you 're actively acknowledging that you 're effectively settling for less than you think you deserve			2
the natural reaction to that is to feel resentful and cheated by life			2
finally learning to compromise is a totally different feeling			0
it 's more like ' ok , so they do n't have all the qualities on my wish list but they do have what i now realise are the important ones and i can live with what 's missing '			0
that decision sits well with most people			0
it 's more ' oh well , turns out you really ca n't have it all ! ' than feeling depressed and disappointed in the future			0
@entity15 says that even if the sex is great it does n't necessarily mean it 's true love have you made peace with all your demons ? you have to be in the right place to meet the right person			1
if you 're still battling all sorts of issues from your past , struggling to recover from a toxic ex and generally not sorted , you are not going to have a great relationship with anyone you meet , no matter how fabulous they are			0
do you view relationships as a place of safety , where you 'll feel supported and loved and have fun ? or as a battleground , where you have to be on guard and protect yourself because you might get hurt ? if it 's the latter , how you feel has nothing to do with who you 're with , it 's to do with issues you need to fix			1
get some therapy and then decide how you feel			0
do n't confuse drama with love some personalities are strongly attracted to each other but do n't bring out the best in each other			0
trouble is , the intermittent reinforcement - the rollercoaster emotional effect - makes us think this must be love			1
these are the dramatic love scenarios we 're used to seeing in movies and reading in books			0
it 's fiction ! the average good relationship would n't be entertaining enough because when you both respect and like each other , there are n't massive ups and downs			1
do n't equate drama with love			0
if you 're worried you 're settling because there are n't any arguments or tension and everything is easy , stop worrying			0
that 's called high compatibility			0
how 's the sex ? most people do n't end up settling down with the person they have the most wicked sex with			0
why ? sometimes it 's because women do n't do the really out - there stuff with a man they think is future husband material ( fears of being judged )			1
other times it 's because what we look for in a long - term partner ( reliability , commitment , stability ) , is n't what we look for in someone we 're having a hot fling with ( spontaneity , someone who 's forbidden and ' bad ' for us )			1
this does n't mean you wo n't have great sex with the right person , just a different kind of sex			0
if you 're thinking you 're settling because the sex is n't as good as it was with that wild ex , you 're being unrealistic			0
sex with anyone calms down over time : it does n't mean you 're settling if you 're not doing it seven times a week or having earth - shattering orgasms every time			1
