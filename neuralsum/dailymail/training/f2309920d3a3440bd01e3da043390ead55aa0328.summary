by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 01:32 est , 26 june 2012 a second world war hero is selling his bravery medal to help with his grandson ’s university costs			0
major @entity5 , 88 , hopes to raise as much as £ 30,000 from the sale of the @entity8 he was awarded after a dangerous spying mission in @entity10 in 1945			1
the family were at first against the idea , but @entity13 said it was better for them to have the money from his medal now rather than it to be left gathering dust in a drawer			1
devoted : @entity5 , pictured left during the war , and right today , hopes to support his family with the money from selling his medal rare : maj @entity5 's @entity8 is particularly valuable because it was won after an operation in @entity10 the grandfather , from @entity27 , @entity28 , was a daring @entity29 agent in @entity30 and was awarded the gallantry medal for his work behind enemy lines in @entity10 in 1945			1
he said : ' i have known of several war veterans who have sold their medals to look after their family			1
pass : this scrap of paper was used by @entity5 to ensure safe passage in lawless the mountains of northern @entity10 ' i am not short of a few bob so i do n’t need it but it is better for my family to have the money now rather than have the medals gathering dust			1
' i am 88 years old and when i go i want to make sure there is plenty left for my wife in case she needs looking after			1
' we have got two grandsons and one of them is at university and i am sure he can use some of the money to help pay his fees or rent			0
' at first my wife @entity61 and son @entity62 were n’t in favour of me selling my medals but they realise it is my decision			2
' i get the medals out and wear them at my local branch of the @entity71 ’s parade every year but the rest of the time they are kept in a drawer			2
' his son said : ' we would prefer him to keep hold of his medals because they are very precious and personal to him			0
' @entity80 has done one year at university and we have paid his fees for next year			2
' but it is my father ’s decision and it is up to him what he wants to do with them			0
' maj @entity5 lied about his age in order to join the army following the outbreak of @entity30 up until then he had been working as a trainee accounts clerk for a grocery business			1
he went on to volunteer for the @entity29 and was parachuted behind enemy lines to carry out spying missions			1
it was a hugely brave act , because spies who were caught by the @entity99 were summarily executed			0
he said : ' usually spies were executed very quickly , i think it was probably bravado that made me volunteer			0
' at first i went on a few drops , taking agents behind the lines and training them in @entity108			2
comrades in arms : @entity5 ( second right ) in @entity112 with fellow soldiers at the war 's end ' i was parachuted into north west @entity10 and the mission was to arm the partisans by arranging for supplies and ammunition to get to them by keeping in radio contact			1
' maj @entity5 received his military medal following an operation in which he and four other agents were pursued and shot at by the @entity124 for two months in north west @entity10 in 1945			1
maj @entity5 , then a sergeant , and his captain , @entity126 , were tracked down to a farmhouse			1
the young soldier told @entity126 of his fears that @entity99 were approaching them as they headed up a hilltop			0
he wrote in his memoirs : ' there was not a sound or a sight to back up my claim			0
@entity126 said : " do n't be silly , @entity138			0
they could n't creep up a hill like this without us seeing or hearing them			0
" ' to the best of my recollection , those were @entity126 's last words			0
devoted : hero @entity5 with his wife @entity149 , who he hopes to support with the money from selling his medal weapons supplies : maj @entity5 , left , with @entity10 fighters at a memorial service in 1988 ' i had a sub-machine gun and started firing back			1
we retreated and gave each other firing cover as we did			0
' capt @entity126 was shot dead , along with four local partisans , while @entity161 stood beside him			0
against all odds , maj @entity5 escaped and managed to prevent his wireless set from falling into enemy hands			1
he returned to the scene the next day to recover his captain ’s body and arrange for its burial			2
@entity5 joined up with another group and continued to harass the enemy and among the partisans became known as ' @entity173 ' or ' il biondino '			1
he was present at the liberation of @entity112 and later met an @entity10 woman , @entity61 , who he married in @entity176 , @entity28			0
the @entity8 is being sold with six others and various mementoes including photographs			0
his military medal along with the 1939 - 45 @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 1939 - 45 are being sold by @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			2
the 88 - year - old , pictured with his @entity10 wife @entity188 , is determined to provide for her and his son 's family @entity191 explained that @entity161 should have received the higher award of a @entity193 but did not due to a clerical error			1
he said : ' @entity161 would have been in no doubt whatsoever of his fate if captured - immediate execution at best - and yet when two of his officers were killed on operations , one of them riddled with machine - gun fire within six feet of him , he took charge of the mission and remained active in the field until the war ’s end			2
' he was rightly recommended for an immediate award of the @entity193 , though an ill - informed senior had this reduced to the @entity8			2
' be that as it may , his @entity8 is a great rarity , more so than similar decorations issued to the wartime @entity215			0
' maj @entity5 ’s gong is said to be particularly desirable because he operated in @entity10 and not in @entity217 like most other @entity29 agents			1
the auction takes place on wednesday , and will be conducted by @entity186 in @entity221 .			0
