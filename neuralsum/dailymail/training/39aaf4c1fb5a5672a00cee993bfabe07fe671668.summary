by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 8 march 2013 scientists have discovered evidence of massive flooding on @entity4 billions of years ago			1
new maps of the subsurface of @entity4 show for the first time buried channels below the surface of the red planet			1
@entity4 is thought to have been cold and dry over the past 2.5 billion years , but the channels suggest evidence of flooding , the scientists say			1
the location of the 1000 km @entity15 channel system on @entity4			2
the dashed box highlights the area shown in the next image			0
the background shows the global topography of @entity4 they are now investigating whether such floods could have induced climate change			1
the channels were found in @entity25 , an expanse of plains along the equator , and the youngest volcanic region on the plane			2
the @entity32 maps were constructed using data from the shallow radar on board the @entity38 @entity37 spacecraft			0
the team included researchers from @entity38 's @entity41 , the @entity42 , the @entity43 in the @entity44 and the @entity45			0
they are now studying the source and scale of the channels to comprehend recent @entity4 hydrologic activity and determine whether such floods could be behind climate change on our planetary neighbour			1
geologist @entity55 , at the @entity54 's @entity53 , said the work was an important advancement in understanding how water shaped @entity4			0
@entity59 of the buried @entity15 channels beneath the @entity4 surface			1
@entity15 consists of multiple perched channels formed around streamlined islands he said : ‘ our findings show that the scale of erosion was previously underestimated and that channel depth was at least twice that of previous approximations			0
‘ the source of the floodwaters suggests they originated from a deep groundwater reservoir and may have been released by local tectonic or volcanic activity			0
‘ this work demonstrates the importance of orbital sounding radar in understanding how water has shaped the surface of @entity4			2
’ the orbiting spacecraft , using sounding radar , was able to map the buried channels and establish that the floods originated from a now buried portion of the @entity88 fracture system			2
the study is published in the journal @entity91 .			0
