@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his column for @entity4			0
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on @entity11 's transfer policy and team building @entity14 style			1
@entity15 i remember a few years ago @entity14 speaking about team bonding			1
he was of the opinion that a round of golf and 10 rounds of @entity22 was supposed to be good for team spirit			1
he thought that if you were together as a team , trained hard and practiced collectively then on those cold , windy , rainy nights when you travel miles to get to the ground , you 'll know you can rely on your team - mates in tough , testing conditions			2
when you earn that hard - fought 1 - 0 away win , get back on the bus for that long journey home , you are exhausted but proud			0
great scot ! @entity14 had his own methods of team building , which can involve golf and @entity22 top			1
@entity6 lead the conference well , i thought of that advice from @entity14 after our first game of the @entity37 season away to @entity42			1
our bus set off from north @entity44 at 8am for the three - hour and 42 minute journey			0
we 're having no over-night stops this year at @entity6 as all that extra expenditure is going towards paying higher wages			1
our bus driver @entity49 has the latest device , called a traffic finder			0
in essence , it appears to mean we find traffic wherever it is			0
@entity56 and behold there was a serious traffic accident on the @entity59			0
we took a diversion , using the @entity51 , across country			0
@entity49 said we should be there in half - an - hour			0
two hours later , we were stuck on an a road , in single - file traffic , moving at five miles per hour			0
we finally pulled into @entity42 's @entity65 at 2.27pm			2
we threw all the match kit in the middle of the changing room floor , emptied the boots into the shower room and turned the shinpad box over			0
the lads grabbed what they could , we warmed up for only 10 minutes before taking to the field for the three o'clock kick off			0
on the road : getting caught in traffic led to @entity6 beating @entity42 5 - 0 in the @entity78 by 30 minutes we were 3 - 0 up and ended up winning by five			1
on the bus journey home , i reflected that in the face of adversity and a six - and - a - half hour bus ride there , the team spirit was strachan-esque to perform like we did			2
it 's one of the most extraordinary days i 've had in football			2
@entity88 we 've had @entity89 as a guest at training this month			1
he is an excellent coach and to save him from boredom i got him in with us			0
@entity89 's energy and enthusiasm rubs off on everybody			1
he 's got good knowledge and it 's been a pleasure having him with all our players			2
the only problem i 've got , is getting him off the training pitch			1
he just loves working , developing and improving our players			0
@entity89 , who has been out of work since he was sacked by @entity103 last year , has got a tremendous record and i find it strange that he is not working at a very high level			1
coach trip : @entity89 's only problem at @entity6 has been getting him off the training pitch @entity110 is on fire a week before the season started i had a phone call from a bloke called @entity115 asking if he could train with us just to get fit , as he had no club			1
i told him we were no longer having anyone on trial as we were in the key stages of preparing for the season			0
i wished him luck , and just out of decency i asked @entity115 who he played for previously			1
he replied : ' i 'm the @entity115 who got transferred to @entity125 from @entity126 for £ 2.5million five years ago			1
' recipe for success : former @entity125 star @entity115 has earned himself a contract after pitching up to to train i thought we had got to get him in , so i invited him to training the following day			1
i warned him that we did n't have any money to pay him			0
we trained him hard – and in the first session he vomited everywhere			0
@entity115 was playing in the @entity134 @entity133 for @entity135 since january but he did n't have a club			1
he can hardly run , but he 's always got a smile on his face and has a wicked left foot			2
well , he earned himself a one - year deal , has already scored a hat - trick and is our top scorer with six goals			2
@entity115 has certainly got the recipe for success			1
@entity147 's analysis ... the person i keep hearing about this month ... @entity151			1
@entity152 have had a resurgence under former @entity154 defender @entity151			1
i have been impressed with his managerial methods			0
i met him recently and he told me he only recruits players from the lower levels who are hungry for football , rather than those who ca n't get a club elsewhere and are dropping into the @entity37			0
remember the name ! @entity154 could do worse than take a chance on @entity152 boss @entity151 ( @entity165 ) @entity166 beat @entity6 4 - 0 at the end of last season – and it could have been 10			1
afterwards , i met @entity151 in my office			2
as he was shutting the door to leave , he stepped back in and asked if i knew where the nearest supermarket or off - licence was			0
i told him i did n't have a clue and asked why			0
he replied that they had no midweek game and winning away from home called for a case of lager for the lads to share at the back of the bus , rewarding them for their hard work			0
@entity154 are looking for a new manager and he would be ideal			1
one thing i would change about ... @entity189 football should follow rugby and have the old time keeper sat up in the stands , separate from everybody			1
it would help avoid any question or doubt about @entity189			2
tick tock ! using an independent timekeeper as they do in rugby would prevent a ' @entity189 ' fiasco they should have full control of the clock , the time - wasting and the ball being out of play and independently decide on added time			1
as soon as that time comes to an end , a massive foghorn should be blown around the stadium to end the game , wherever the ball is on the pitch			2
it would create entertainment and talking points			0
i reckon that would be magic – unless we were a goal down , on the attack and it went off ! the big issue ... why has @entity224 splashed almost £ 60million on @entity225 ? my old youth team manager at @entity227 , from whom i learnt so much , always said that you have to build teams from the back			1
building from the back : @entity11 chose to spend £ 60m on @entity225 when what they needed was defenders @entity11 should 've spent that huge fee for @entity235 on @entity237 centre - back @entity236 and @entity239 's @entity238			1
@entity240 would 've been a central figure and a leader and @entity238 could 've been an enforcer in front of him			0
@entity239 were making noises that they were willing to let him go for £ 27.5million			2
@entity11 now have @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 – they were not crying out for @entity235			2
mr @entity251 was pleading for patience after their gaal - ing performance against my old club @entity254 in the @entity256			0
but that was a real chance of silverware for them and he blew it			0
they 've got no chance of winning the @entity133 , are not in @entity262 and the only cup they could win is the @entity265			0
their team needs strengthening – and fast – to have any chance of that			2
oops ! @entity11 have no chance of winning any silverware under @entity224 this season it ’s not too late to play @entity273 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1

@entity14 's team building advice usually involves golf and @entity22
@entity11 needed defenders not blowing £ 60m on @entity225
@entity89 's only problem has been getting him off the training pitch
@entity152 boss @entity151 could be an ideal *candidate* for the @entity154 job
former @entity125 star @entity115 has earned himself a contract at @entity6
independent timekeepers used in rugby are the only answer to @entity189
