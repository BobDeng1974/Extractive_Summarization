@entity1 's selfie , accompanied by the ' feeling sad ' emoji , clearly shows his uncle 's corpse in the background a man has caused a storm on social media after posting a selfie of himself with his uncle 's corpse during a funeral			1
@entity1 , 34 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , stunned friends and family when he snapped himself standing in front of his dead uncle lying on a funeral bed			1
the photo was then posted onto his @entity22 and @entity23 accounts			2
accompanying it , using the @entity26 translation for uncle , were the words : ' my peiriya appa passed away			0
' this was followed by a ' sad face ' emoji and the words ' feeling sad '			1
but he was soon turned on by shocked online users			2
@entity22 user @entity36 posted : ' oh , man ! really ? this is disgusting			1
' @entity40 wrote : ' what is this ? a @entity43 ? could you sink any lower ? ' @entity45 added : ' i 've never seen anything as disgustingly poor taste as this			2
' mr @entity1 soon took the photo down but not before it had begun doing the rounds on social media			1
a friend of mr @entity1 's said : ' he was very upset and wanted to express that and share his grief and final moments with his uncle with his friends			0
' being upset he was n't thinking clearly though , as this was obviously a bad idea , to say the least			0
' he apologises for any offence he has caused			0
' although there 's no doubt the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon , popularized perhaps most famously by @entity67 , there remain some limits to its acceptability			0
among the people to have gained notoriety are a man who took a photo of himself in front of his dead grandmother 's casket , those smiling cheerily at the scene of the @entity80 siege in december and people taking pictures of themselves before sometimes fatal accidents			0
a friend of @entity1 ( pictured ) said he was very upset and simply wanted to express his grief @entity1 ( pictured left and right ) has been criticised for posting the selfie in which his uncle was visible			1
