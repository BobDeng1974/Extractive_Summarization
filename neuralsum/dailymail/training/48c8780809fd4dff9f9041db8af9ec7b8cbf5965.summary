whether we are alone in the universe is one of life ’s unanswered questions			0
but a new poll suggests that the majority of us are convinced aliens exist , and that we 're more likely to believe in little green men than @entity9			1
according to the research , children in particular are so confident in the existence of extraterrestrial beings that they think family members are aliens in disguise			1
ghosts topped the list on 55 % , followed by aliens ( a screengrab from 1982 film @entity25 is pictured ) on 51 %			2
children believed in aliens and ghosts equally ( 64 % ) , and more than quarter of the children asked said they believe some humans are aliens in disguise the poll of 2,000 adults and children was carried out by @entity17 attraction in @entity18			1
each of the participants were asked to rate how strongly they believed in five supernatural or religious beings including aliens , ghosts , ufos , angels and @entity9			1
ghosts topped the adult ’s list on 55 per cent , followed by aliens on 51 per cent and ufos on 42 per cent			1
@entity9 was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent , behind angels on 27 per cent			1
children believed in aliens and ghosts equally ( 64 % ) , ufos scored 50 per cent followed by @entity9 on 33 per cent			1
@entity54 were bottom of this group 's list on 27 per cent			0
top beliefs among adults : ghosts ( 55 per cent ) aliens ( 51 per cent ) ufos ( 42 per cent ) @entity54 ( 27 per cent ) @entity9 ( 25 per cent ) top belief among children ( aged 8 to 12 ) : aliens ( 64 per cent ) ghosts ( 64 per cent ) ufos ( 50 per cent ) @entity9 ( 33 per cent ) @entity54 ( 27 per cent ) * according to a poll of 1,500 @entity69 adults and 500 @entity69 children @entity71 , general manager for @entity17 ! @entity18 said : ‘ we live in the age of science and turn to it for most of our answers , but the results show that many of us still hold belief in things that might exist outside of our world and beyond our understanding			1
‘ it ’s reassuring to have the answers for many of life ’s questions but the average person will always be drawn to the odd , the unexpected and to the question ‘ what if ? ’			0
‘ according to the results it ’s clearly not just children who have an open mind when it comes to other life forms and keeping an open mind			2
’ the poll also found that more than a quarter of children ( 26 per cent ) believe that aliens are disguised as humans - and one in twenty think their mother is an extra-terrestrial , although the most likely suspect is their brother			1
almost half of the children admitted they think there is a stereotype associated with aliens with 43 per cent of children claiming aliens are most likely to be green			1
@entity9 was at the bottom of the adult 's list of beliefs 25 % , behind angels on 27 %			1
meanwhile , children were more likely to believe in @entity9 ( 33 % ) than angels ( 27 % )			1
ufos ( illustrated right ) came third on both the adult and children 's lists on 45 % and 50 % respectively adults were found to be more superstitious than children , with 26 per cent of them swearing by touching wood so as not to tempt fate , and refusing to ever walk underneath a ladder			1
almost 15 per cent of adults said they were more scared of spiders ( pictured ) , big dogs and heights than their children but it ’s not just children that have their suspicions – a third of adults polled said they have had a strange feeling about a certain building they have entered			2
one in five also admitted they have experienced a supernatural presence in their own home			2
adults were found to be more superstitious than children , too , with 26 per cent of them swearing by touching wood so as not to tempt fate , and refusing to ever walk underneath a ladder			2
almost 15 per cent of adults said they were more scared of ghosts than their children , and over half ( 53 per cent ) said they try to hide their fear of things to prevent their children from feeling scared			1
this mainly referred to being scared of spiders ( 47 per cent ) as well as big dogs ( 24 per cent ) , heights ( 23 per cent ) and flying ( 13 per cent )			0
@entity161 recently told @entity162 he wants biologists to start to consider what other life might be like in the the likely event we discover we are not alone			0
' the number of stars in current estimates is 10 to the power of 22 , and it looks as though most of them have planets , so it 's feasible to say the number of planets is in excess of 10 to the power of 22 , ' he said			0
' it would seem to be rash to predict we 're the only life form in the entire universe			2
' on the other hand if there was only one planet that has life then it has to be this one , because here we are			0
' the alternative is to say yes , we are alone			0
if you want to believe that then the origin of life on this planet has to be a quite staggeringly improbable event			0
' ' so we 're left with the rather paradoxical result that people who are trying to work out how life originated on this planet are totally wasting their time , because the theory we 're seeking is not a plausible theory , it 's an exceedingly implausible theory			2
' @entity161 explained that if there is a plausible theory for the origin of life - one that has yet to be put forward - then there 's going to be ' lots and lots ' of life in the universe			0
' i think there 's lots of life in the universe , but that 's just a hunch			0
it may still be very rare ; it may be so rare that there are only a billion of them			0
' if there are only a billion life forms then they will probably be so spaced out from each other that they 'll never know each other and never come in contact			0
' if they do come in contact , if we ever come in contact , it will almost certainly be by radio than by actually bodily meeting .			0

@entity17 @entity18 surveyed 2,000 adults and children
they discovered that adults are most likely to believe in ghosts and aliens
while children are convinced that aliens exist - and more than a quarter think some humans are aliens in disguise
both groups also believed ufos exist , above believing in @entity9 and angels
parents also admitted they 're more *afraid* of the supernatural than children
