by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 20:52 est , 9 january 2013 six - figure bids are expected when an auction house sells a rare 148 - year - old baseball card that was discovered at a yard sale in rural @entity6 , the auction house manager said today			1
a man found the card by chance in a photo album he bought while antique hunting in the small town of @entity13 , @entity6 , said @entity14 of @entity15 in @entity16			1
it 's not the same as a modern baseball card , which became commonplace beginning in the 1880s			1
instead , it 's an original photograph from 1865 of the @entity23 amateur baseball club mounted on a card			2
the card shows nine players gathered around their manager			2
strike ! the rare 1865 baseball card of the @entity23 , discovered in a photo album bought at a yard sale in @entity13 , @entity6 , is expected to raise $ 100,000 at auction @entity14 said he 's aware of only two such cards in existence , the other at the @entity36			1
putting a dollar - figure value on it is difficult , he said , but he expects it to fetch at least $ 100,000 at the february 6 auction			0
' there has n't been another one that 's sold , ' he said			0
' when there are only two known in the world , what 's it worth ? ' last summer , the auction house sold a rare 1888 card of @entity51 baseball player @entity50 for $ 72,000			2
the priciest baseball card ever is a 1909 @entity54 card , which sold for $ 2.8 million in 2007			2
the @entity36 has had another copy of the @entity23 photograph since the late 1800s , when it took possession of it from a @entity61 court where the photographer , @entity62 , had submitted it for copyright			1
in its book @entity66 , the @entity36 calls it the first dated baseball card , handed out to supporters and opposing teams in a gesture of bravado from the brash @entity73 , who were dominant and won their league championships in 1861 , 1864 and 1865			0
lucky find : a man found the card while looking for antiques in the town of @entity13 , @entity6 it 's not known how many were produced , but the @entity36 is aware of only the two copies			1
a trading card grading firm , @entity84 , has authenticated the card as the real thing , said @entity87 , senior grader at the @entity89 company			0
one to watch : cards of @entity91 in the 1920s normally draw a high price at auction the @entity6 man bought the card by happenstance			0
while at a yard sale , he bought a photo album , old @entity101 bottles and a couple of oak chairs for less than $ 100 , @entity14 said			1
while looking through the album , the buyer came across the baseball card			1
he later mailed it to @entity15 , having read about the auction house 's sale of the 1888 card last summer			0
@entity14 did not release the man 's name , saying he did not want to be identified			0
the rarest card around came from a 1923 promotional set of 30 cards , each with a black - and - white likeness of @entity91 , @entity118 , or some other baseball star			0
the cards were distributed by the @entity121 in @entity122 , and the person who collected all 30 could claim a prize , said @entity125 , librarian at the @entity51 in @entity126 , @entity127 but only one @entity129 card was produced among the entire bunch , @entity125 said , and that card is located in the @entity51 archives .			0
