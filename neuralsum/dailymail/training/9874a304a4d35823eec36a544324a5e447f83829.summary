by @entity0 a photographer captured a pair of unidentified objects apparently hovering near the flight path of a passenger jet as he took pictures of huge storm clouds gathering over @entity8			1
photographer @entity9 snapped photos of the two objects flying either side of a @entity14 passenger jet while taking photos of angry skies off @entity18 's coast mr @entity9 believes they are unidentified flying objects or ufos			1
' i uploaded the photos only minutes later on my laptop and i zoomed in and said " what is this " ? ' in the series of photographs , taken in 2009 , a saucer - like and cigar - shaped object are seen flying either side of a @entity39 plane			1
over the next few days , mr @entity9 tried to find out what the objects were , but was unsuccessful			2
' i tried to experiment to determine whether or not any insects or birds could have produced similar results , which is impossible – i ’ve consulted with other photographers , ' he said			0
this photo is part of a series of about nine photos taken consecutively showing two objects flying near a @entity39 passenger plane ' the photographs are authentic and they are objects that can not be claimed			1
' if you invert the photo to a negative , the plane appears white as a solid object and so do the other objects			2
' but this is not the first time mr @entity9 has spotted an unexplained object			1
he said he had seen them with his own eyes but had rarely captured them on film			0
' it always pays to have a camera handy , ' the 38 - year - old said			0
even though the photos were taken in 2009 , mr @entity9 has been holding them close to his chest			1
in this negative image , the two objects ( left and right ) appear in white on either side of the plane ( centre ) indicating they are solid but with the unexplained disappearance of the @entity77 flight , he felt it was time to share them			0
' there ’s a big a question mark next to that plane and a lot of conspiracies surrounding what happened , ' mr @entity9 said			2
' maybe it ’s the right time for the world to know and that these things are real			0
' flight mh370 was flying from @entity90 to @entity91 when it went missing on march 8			0
the search for the plane continues off the coast of @entity95 in the southern @entity96 .			0
