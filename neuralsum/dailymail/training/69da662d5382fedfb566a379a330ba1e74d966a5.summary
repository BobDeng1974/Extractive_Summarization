the former @entity21 captain had well - known disputes with his manager , notably about the company he was keeping , before moving to @entity25 in 2003 and makes an all - star cast - almost all of whom had their differences with @entity17			0
@entity0 , talking in an @entity31 documentary with @entity9 , had @entity32 and @entity33 leading the line , with no room for @entity6 - pipped to a right - back slot by @entity37			1
there were also slots for @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
‘ these boys did challenge the manager in different ways			0
@entity14 challenged the manager , but because you marry a certain woman does n’t mean you ’re challenging the manager			0
‘ i think the manager ’s got to understand that we ’ve got different personalities in our dressing room but maybe that ’s why we are winning trophies			0
’ @entity1 was excluded to make room for @entity42 , with @entity0 reasoning : ‘ having a great career does n’t mean you ’re a great player , i think there is a big difference			1
‘ i ’m not saying @entity1 was n’t ... do i leave @entity42 out ? one of the world ’s greatest players ? do i leave @entity14 out ? i just could n’t feel like i could leave @entity14 out			1
’ out : @entity37 was preferred to @entity6 ( above ) at right - back @entity83 ’s @entity82 dream team @entity84 : @entity85 @entity86 : @entity37 @entity87 : @entity88 @entity87 : @entity40 lb : @entity89 @entity25 : @entity14 @entity87 : @entity41 @entity87 : @entity0 @entity87 : @entity42 @entity90 : @entity33 @entity90 : @entity32 @entity9 was also asked for the best @entity91 while he was at the club , which was n’t quite as controversial			1
@entity93 and @entity94 both made it , unsurprisingly , while wingers @entity96 and @entity98 - so effective during the @entity99 year - got the nod too			0
interestingly , @entity9 claims that @entity101 was a ready - made @entity12 captain had he not left for @entity102 in 2006			1
talking about when @entity101 moved to @entity103 , @entity9 said : ‘ i was quite surprised to be honest			1
i tried to fight it a little bit because i wanted him to stay			0
‘ @entity101 was supposed to be the next @entity12 captain because he was a player from the youth , grew up to the club and to let him go and see him go was disappointing			1
’ surprised : @entity9 ( left ) wanted @entity101 ( right ) to be @entity12 captain before his @entity102 move legend : of course , record goalscorer @entity93 makes the xi @entity9 ’s @entity113 @entity84 : @entity114 @entity86 : @entity115 @entity87 : @entity116 @entity87 : @entity117 lb : @entity101 @entity25 : @entity98 @entity87 : @entity9 @entity87 : @entity118 @entity87 : @entity96 @entity90 : @entity119 @entity90 : @entity93 the pair then had to create a dream team made up of the two squads , with the main bone of contention coming at left - back			1
@entity0 fought hard for @entity89 ’s inclusion while his rival argued the case of @entity101			1
amusingly they could n’t agree			0
‘ you ’d have @entity89 in there every day of the week , ’ @entity0 said bullishly			2
‘ no , ’ was the straight reply			0
‘ @entity101 is ... ’ @entity9 started before being cut off			2
‘ @entity133 heard any off the field stuff ( with @entity89 ) , ’ smiled @entity0			2
eventually both players were named			0
meeting minds : @entity0 ( right ) and @entity9 came together for an @entity31 documentary @entity14 was omitted from that side after @entity9 insisted on @entity96 coming in on the right - hand side			1
‘ pires over @entity14 ? @entity140 , @entity9 ! ’ the two had themselves patrolling the middle of the park			2
‘ i ’ll put myself in there , that ’d be good			0
@entity147 probably be sent off , ’ @entity0 said			2
@entity9 : ‘ can you imagine ? you would be sent off one week i would be sent off the next			2
’ these two received 21 career red cards between them			0
wing wizards : @entity96 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) make the combined xi genius : @entity33 makes up a deadly front two combined team @entity84 : @entity85 @entity86 : @entity115 @entity87 : @entity116 @entity87 : @entity40 lb : @entity101 / @entity89 @entity25 : @entity42 @entity87 : @entity0 @entity87 : @entity9 @entity87 : @entity96 @entity90 : @entity93 @entity90 : @entity33 best of enemies : @entity0 and @entity9 had a series of bust - ups during their respective careers both looked back on now may seem like missed opportunities to play abroad			1
@entity9 was within a whisker of joining @entity25 while @entity0 says he had a couple of options			1
‘ i was really close to leaving to @entity25 the year before i left			0
the deal was done between the two clubs so when it was time for me to leave i changed my mind because i believed that i wanted to stay at @entity12 , i wanted to finish my career at @entity12			1
‘ i did n’t see any reason to leave , i do n’t know if it was lack of courage to go			0
if i knew i was leaving the year after i was going to @entity25			0
@entity0 added : ‘ when my contract ran down on a couple of occasions i spoke to a couple of clubs , @entity178 , @entity179			2
i was very tempted i have to say but like yourself there was a bit of fear			0
‘ contracts were agreed but i just never felt strong and want to go for it because i was very happy at @entity3			2
’ @entity0 and @entity9 were talking in a documentary titled : @entity0 and @entity187 , @entity188 10pm tuesday .			1
