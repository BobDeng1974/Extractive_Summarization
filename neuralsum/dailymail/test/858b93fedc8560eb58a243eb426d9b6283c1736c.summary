from the sky it appears to be an idyllic island with amazing beaches and a dense forest , but tourists or fishermen do n’t dare to set foot on this outcrop in the @entity9 due to its inhabitants ’ fearsome reputation			1
visitors who venture onto or too close to @entity14 risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world			1
when they do interact with outsiders , it usually involves violence – the indigenous @entity24 tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at low - flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions			1
untouched by modern civilisation , very little is known about the @entity24 people , their language , their rituals and the island they call home			0
it is too dangerous to approach them due to their hostility to outsiders , meaning they are rarely photographed up close and almost never seen on video			1
most of the photos and video clips that do exist are of poor quality			0
there are also conflicting reports on the tribe ’s population , with most estimates putting it in the range of a few dozen to a few hundred			0
it ’s still unclear what impact the 2004 tsunami had on the population and the island , which is part of @entity46 ’s chain of @entity80 , although the uncontacted tribe managed to avoid being wiped out			1
after the tsunami one member was photographed attempting to fire an arrow at an @entity41 helicopter			2
the tribespeople are rarely photographed or recorded on video ; the only existing images or video clips tend to be of poor quality to protect the @entity24 people - and visitors - the @entity9 government has established a three - mile exclusion zone often referred to as a ‘ @entity95 tribe ’ – a title that advocates take offence to , as its members have adapted over time – the @entity24 may be the most isolated tribe in the world , with the @entity9 government choosing not to meddle in their affairs			1
the government made several failed attempts to establish contact , but has abandoned all attempts and allows the tribe to live how it chooses on an island that is about the size of @entity45			1
@entity9 authorities have gone as far as making it a crime to try to make contact with the @entity24			1
it is illegal to go within three miles of the island			0
while privileged people are eating £ 15 burgers and splashing £ 100 on new trainers , the near - naked @entity24 are surviving off the land and hunting for sea creatures			0
but the waters surrounding the island appear to be under threat by even more illegal fishermen			0
@entity124 said the islanders are ‘ extremely healthy , alert and thriving ’ , but their fishing waters are being threatened this aerial image shows the dense tree canopy on the island , which has remained untouched by modern civilisation for centuries @entity124 reported late last year that it had received reports that fishermen are targeting the area , with seven men being apprehended by the @entity41			2
one of the fishermen reportedly stepped foot on the island in close proximity to the tribe ’s members , and he managed to leave unscathed			2
@entity124 , which advocates for tribal peoples ’ rights , describes the @entity24 as ‘ the most vulnerable society on the planet ’ as they are likely to have no immunity to common diseases such as flu and measles			0
due to their complete isolation , the chances of them being wiped out by an epidemic are very high , according to the organisation			0
this aerial image from @entity157 shows a shipwreck off the coast ; clashes with salvagers have left several tribespeople dead in a statement , @entity124 ’s director , @entity163 , said : ‘ the @entity166 tribes of @entity46 ’s @entity80 were decimated by disease when the @entity168 colonised the islands in the 1800s			1
‘ the most recent to be pushed into extinction was the @entity173 tribe , whose last member died only four years ago			2
the only way the @entity177 authorities can prevent the annihilation of another tribe is to ensure @entity14 is protected from outsiders			1
’ the organisation said the islanders are ‘ extremely healthy , alert and thriving ’ , despite threats from the outside world and their ' old world ' way of life			2
their hostility towards outsiders can at least be partially attributed to past conflicts			0
@entity124 said ' the outside world has brought them little but violence and contempt '			0
in the late 1980s and early 1990s several tribespeople were killed in battles with armed salvagers who visited the island to recover iron and other goods from a shipwreck .			0

the indigenous tribe has lived on @entity14 in the @entity9 for an estimated 60,000 years
their limited contact with the outside world usually involves violence , as they are hostile towards outsiders
islanders have been known to fire arrows or toss stones at low - flying *aircraft* on reconnaissance missions
tribespeople have rarely been photographed or recorded on video , as it is too dangerous to visit the island
@entity46 *'s* government has given up on making contact with the islanders and established a three - mile exclusion zone
