by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 17 june 2013 @entity1 is preparing to send 4,000 troops in to @entity3 to support @entity3 president @entity4 in the wake of @entity7 's announcement it will be providing ' military aid ' to the country 's @entity10 rebels			1
president @entity12 made the pledge earlier this week after the @entity7 claimed it found ' conclusive evidence ' @entity4 's regime has used chemical weapons against the rebel forces - which includes the most extreme @entity19 - and has called for @entity20 and @entity21 to back the move			1
while @entity20 has n't made a guarantee either way as yet , more than 350 @entity23 are being sent to @entity26 as part of an 8,000 - strong ' multinational exercise ' , further increasing tensions in the war - torn region			1
scroll down to watch video concerns : footage posted on @entity35 shows a @entity3 rebel with a shoulder - fired heat - seeking missile which can target planes up to 11,000ft in the air - and raising questions over how well - armed forced already are in the country risk : the footage has further prompted fears that arming @entity3 's rebels could cause powerful weapons to fall in to the hands of anti-west extremists sources claim the 12 - day exercise , called @entity49 , is part of a plan to have @entity53 troops on hand for humanitarian ­ purposes in @entity3			1
but as the @entity57 debates whether to proceed with ' military intervention ' in @entity3 , where 100,000 people have been killed in the last two years , a video has emerged online showing an @entity61 fighter using a surface - to - air missile			2
the footage shows the fighter targeting a helicopter with a shoulder - fired heat - seeking @entity68 - era @entity67 missile which can hit planes flying at 11,000ft			1
it has sparked fears that the arming of moderate rebels will lead to weapons falling in to the hands of extremists who would want to target the @entity57			1
it comes as the entire @entity78 region threatens to plunge into the growing conflict , which has become a hardline divide between the @entity81 and @entity82 , after it emerged @entity1 is preparing to move troops in to @entity3 to support @entity4			2
taking action : president @entity12 , pictured right , has vowed to give ' military aid ' to the @entity3 rebels - a move which has been welcomed by prime minister @entity89 , pictured left earlier this month more than 100,000 people have lost their lives in the conflict , pictured in @entity92 , in two years the military decision to support @entity4 was made even before @entity1 's presidential election earlier this week , according to @entity95			1
the entire region is becoming increasingly torn between @entity81 who believe that the father of @entity99 ’s wife was the new caliph of the @entity10 world and @entity82 who regard his son - in - law @entity103 as his rightful successor			0
@entity7 now finds itself on the side of the wealthiest states and @entity81 territories of the @entity109 @entity108 - from @entity110 to @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity20 - created monarchy in @entity26			1
on the other side of the divide is @entity1 and the largely @entity116 which the @entity57 ' liberated ' from @entity118 ’s @entity81 minority in the hope of balancing the power of the region			0
but as well as causing a divide between the @entity81 and @entity82 factions of the @entity78 , tensions are increasing between @entity7 and @entity125			0
@entity125 president @entity126 has made no secret of his opposition to any move by the @entity57 to supply arms to the @entity3 opposition			1
holding firm : president @entity4 has accused the @entity57 of backing rebels linked to @entity134 - linked during his country 's civil war growing tensions : @entity89 and president @entity12 will be taking @entity125 's president @entity126 , pictured together in last year , to task over his support of @entity3 president @entity4 's regime he responded to the recent lifting of the @entity146 arms embargo by reaffirming his intention to supply president @entity4 with sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles in order to deter ' hotheads ' from intervening in the conflict			1
and following @entity7 's announcement it will provide ' military aid ' to @entity3 rebels , @entity4 this weekend suggested on @entity158 tv that @entity3 may have received the first shipment of an advanced @entity125 air defence system after @entity161 promised @entity163 missiles			1
@entity89 is due to meet with mr @entity126 for talks on the @entity3 crisis amid fears that differences between @entity161 and the @entity57 are pushing the two sides towards a new @entity169			1
@entity89 has been forced by his own backbenchers to promise a @entity172 vote on @entity20 providing military support to @entity3 rebels the @entity125 president has reacted sceptically to evidence produced by @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity7 that the regime has used chemical weapons - crossing mr @entity12 's ' red line ' for intervention			1
mr @entity89 has welcomed mr @entity12 's announcement , although he has yet to decide whether to follow the president 's lead on supplying arms to the rebels			1
however he said @entity20 would continue to offer non-lethal support to what he called the ' genuine ' opposition - saying it was vital to bolster the democratic elements against the extremists			1
' yes there are elements of the @entity3 opposition that are deeply unsavoury , that are very dangerous , very extremist and i want nothing to do with them			0
i 'd like them driven out of @entity3 - they 're linked to @entity134 , ' he said in an interview with @entity201 's @entity200 programme			2
' but there are elements of the @entity3 opposition who want to see a free democratic , pluralistic @entity3 that respects the rights of minorities including @entity207 and we should be working with them - we are working with them			2
' if we do n't work with those elements of the @entity3 opposition , then we ca n't be surprised if the only elements of the @entity3 opposition that are getting , that are actually making any progress in @entity3 , are the ones that we do n't approve of			0
' after all , they are trying to defend their communities against appalling attacks , including , let 's be clear , chemical weapon attacks			0
president @entity4 is now guilty of the most appalling crimes against his people - 90,000 people dead and some of them through the use of appalling chemical weapons			2
' clash of opinions : @entity3 will be a major topic at the meeting of the @entity230 leaders - depicted by members of @entity232 today ahead of the start of the summit @entity110 president @entity235 yesterday announced that he was cutting off diplomatic relations with @entity3 and closing @entity238 ' embassy in @entity239 amid growing calls from hard - line @entity81 clerics to launch a ' holy war ' against @entity3 's embattled regime even if mr @entity89 were to decide that @entity20 should start supplying arms , he may find his path blocked in the face of strong opposition in @entity248 across all three main parties			1
the prime minister again reaffirmed the commitment wrung out of him by @entity253 rebels that he would give mps a vote if he decided @entity20 should go ahead and arm the @entity3 opposition			2
' i think @entity248 should have a say about these things			0
i ca n't really go further than that , ' he said			0
meanwhile @entity261 struck a decidedly cautious tone over @entity3 today , raising questions about how much support there is in government for @entity89 's increasingly hawkish stance over the conflict			1
battle : @entity3 rebel fighters belonging to the ' martyrs of @entity273 ' battalion leave their position after a series of shootings in the northwestern town of @entity273 earlier this week civil war : a vehicle is seen burning in the village of @entity281 , north of @entity282 , in @entity3 's central @entity284 province as regime forces sought to mop up the final pockets of rebel resistance north of @entity282 earlier this month ahead of a meeting between the prime minister and @entity125 president @entity126 , @entity261 told the @entity292 programme that arming the rebels was ' not the right thing to do now at this point '			1
he added : ' we 're trying to strike the right balance between playing a part with other allies but not embroiling this country in military conflict in a way i do n't think would be acceptable to the @entity20 people			2
' asked whether the deputy prime minister 's more cautious tone suggested the @entity307 were prepared to oppose intervention in the same way they opposed war in @entity116 , @entity261 was keen to point out the differences			0
' this is not like @entity116 and it 's different to @entity315 as well			0
this is a bloody civil war			0
the idea we can provide a unilateral @entity20 military solution to this is fanciful , ' he said			2
cautious : deputy prime minister @entity261 today told presenter @entity323 on @entity324 that arming rebels is not the right thing to do at ' this time ' former @entity307 leader @entity327 said it would be ' an act of very considerable folly ' to start arming the rebels			2
he warned that the @entity57 risked being drawn into a wider sectarian struggle between @entity81 and @entity82 who are backed by @entity1 and @entity125			0
' this not about @entity3			0
we think @entity3 is the issue , it 's not			0
it 's the front line in a much , much wider struggle , ' he told the @entity200 programme			0
' the issue now is not tackling the @entity339 , it is preparing for a war against the @entity341 in @entity342			0
' we are now being inadvertently - and stupidly in my view - instrumentalised into supporting the @entity81 on the one hand while the @entity125 are being instrumentalised into supporting the @entity82			0
' i do n't believe that it is sensible for us to be contributing to that process			0

350 @entity23 on way to @entity26 as part of ' multinational exercise '
@entity89 welcomed @entity12 's vow to provide ' military aid ' to @entity3 rebels but has so far only promised @entity20 's ' non-lethal ' support
@entity20 and @entity7 to tackle @entity126 for supporting @entity3 's president at @entity230 meet
videos on @entity35 shows rebels with shoulder - fired heat - seeking missiles
