one of my favourite lines in sport is : ‘ winners perform at their best when the pressure is at its greatest			0
’ @entity5 and @entity6 are under real pressure now			2
they may be annoyed at the criticism they received after @entity12 but it was not the result , it was the manner of their defeat			0
@entity6 were inferior in every area of the game , and that should hurt a lot			2
after a great start against @entity22 , @entity6 had the wind taken out of their sails by @entity25			2
suddenly the nightmare scenario of @entity6 not making it out of a @entity29 group which contains @entity22 and @entity30 becomes a real threat			1
@entity32 is among @entity6 's fringe players who must get a start in the remaining @entity35 games @entity5 's focus must shift to the @entity29 with two competitive matches left before it starts @entity39 may be left out due to his choice to play for @entity41 but he 's really too good to ignore @entity43 ’s men have just five games before their campaign begins against @entity46 on september 18 ... @entity35 saturday , march 14 v @entity47 ( h ) saturday , march 21 v @entity48 ( h ) @entity29 warm - ups saturday august 15 v @entity48 ( h ) saturday august 22 v @entity48 ( a ) saturday september 5 v @entity25 ( h ) if @entity22 defeat @entity25 at home this weekend , their year is back on track and they go into @entity29 camp in great shape			1
@entity30 will be battle - hardened and energised by a new coaching team			0
they know if they can put a scrum together to compete with @entity6 then @entity61 holds no fears			1
with two games to go in the @entity35 , @entity6 ’s momentum going into the @entity29 camp depends on their performances against @entity47 and @entity48			1
they should win those games regardless of the team they select			0
but @entity5 faces some crucial decisions : either continue along the same path or make changes , and send the message to everyone that there is yet more to come from his side			0
since the end of last year ’s @entity35 , @entity6 have lost six out of eight matches against top - tier teams			1
my concern is that teams will look at @entity6 and like what they see			2
nobody doubts the front five is as good as any in the world			0
the @entity6 pack is fearsome , and behind the scrum they have the players - but a response is needed			2
now is the time to show that ‘ pressure ’ sits comfortably on their shoulders			0
here ’s my seven - point guide that @entity6 should follow ... @entity6 's squad are put through their paces ahead of saturday 's @entity35 clash with @entity47 1 pool practice 2015 is all about the @entity29 , nothing else			1
@entity6 can win the @entity35 title on points difference , but in a @entity29 year , once the @entity105 is gone , the tournament is gone			1
@entity6 only have five games before their @entity29 opener in september , and three of those are friendlies , which are not games to judge anybody on			1
that leaves just two meaningful matches - @entity47 and @entity48 at home			1
these are must - win games , but use them as rehearsals for the pool matches against @entity22 and @entity30			0
@entity6 have to do everything they can to replicate the atmosphere they will encounter when they play those @entity29 games			1
2 three and easy there are three men @entity43 still needs to see start - @entity32 , @entity39 and @entity124			1
@entity5 can make it clear he ’s not dropping @entity126 , but he needs to find out about @entity32 in a significant game once and for all			1
@entity39 is arguably the best player in @entity129 and must be in the squad			2
we can deal with the politics of overseas players after the @entity29 , but let ’s just get the best players on the field			0
@entity43 needs to find out about @entity32 in a significant game once and for all , so he should start @entity124 - alongside @entity138 - is perhaps the most in - form centre in @entity6 and his left foot , at inside centre , would offer more kicking variations			1
@entity6 ’s kicking game was poor against @entity25 and they have got to find players who can dictate a game			1
@entity146 is now so important and they are off the pace			0
perhaps only one of the three will really seize their opportunity , but at least you will know once and for all			0
@entity5 must be bold and those selections would change the whole atmosphere at @entity61			0
@entity155 's @entity124 is probably the most in - form centre in @entity6 at the moment so should be tested 3 @entity158 i ’m a big @entity160 fan but he is in a very competitive position and must be in the team on merit , so we need to see his biggest rival play			1
also , if he gets injured in the first minute at the @entity29 , nobody knows who will replace him as captain			1
it ’s time to see who else has the capacity to lead this team and i would give @entity173 a chance to see how he handles the task , which allows you to bring in @entity39 at @entity177			1
@entity173 is one of the few players who captains his club , so give the role to him on saturday			1
captain @entity160 , here attempting a drop goal at training , should be rested to try out alternatives @entity173 captains @entity184 so would be an interesting replacement for @entity160 should one be needed 4 @entity186 the current back row of @entity160 , @entity173 and @entity188 is not quick enough at the very top level			1
it is such a shame @entity191 is injured - he is one of the quickest forwards in world rugby at @entity194 - while @entity39 is no slouch			0
in a @entity29 you are playing against the fittest and fastest players , and you need to be able to match that			0
we have a big powerful front five but we do not need the same in the back row , we need speed			1
the current back row of @entity188 ( pictured ) , @entity173 and @entity160 do n't have the speed required 5 get your kicks @entity207 is one of the best coaches i ’ve ever worked with			1
that ’s why i ’d bring him back into the @entity6 set - up			2
it was n’t just @entity214 ’s kicking that he helped - @entity207 improved the whole team			1
@entity6 ’s kicking and catching was so poor against @entity25 and the whole world will have seen that			2
@entity207 ( right ) not only helped @entity214 's prodigious kicking but the all - round @entity6 game it would be a challenge persuading him to join because he is very much his own man , but he is the best person for the job by a long way			1
many of his methods , based on @entity228 rules football , could be introduced over the coming months			0
then , by the time @entity6 go into camp , the team will understand how he operates and will have one of the game ’s great specialist coaches at their disposal			0
6 focus on fitness when i managed @entity6 , i made it clear i would only pick players who can play 80 minutes			2
if you ca n’t last a full game at full pace , you are not going to survive in a @entity29			0
@entity43 has faith in his strength and conditioning team , but an independent opinion , from someone who has prepared @entity29 teams , could be a shot in the arm			0
i would bring in someone like @entity253 , who was in my set - up , was with @entity255 at @entity256 and is now head of performance at the @entity259			0
he will pull no punches and get everyone ’s mind back on track			0
every player picked should be fit enough to play for 80 minutes if they 're worthy of the @entity29 7 smarter subs assuming all your players can last 80 minutes , the first purpose of your bench should be for injury replacements , but @entity6 started against @entity25 with no specialist second - row substitute			1
if @entity276 had gone off in the first minute , could @entity275 really play the whole game in the second row ? secondly , the bench is there to make tactical changes			2
@entity43 ’s substitutions against @entity25 were his most important because @entity6 were chasing the game			0
but his changes surprised me			0
@entity285 @entity286 @entity138 @entity124 @entity287 @entity32 @entity288 @entity289 @entity290 @entity291 @entity292 @entity276 @entity293 @entity173 @entity39 with 15 minutes to go he needed to bring on @entity32 , not @entity294			1
keeping @entity295 in the game was the right call but he needed help creatively and with the boot			0
for @entity43 to say @entity32 coming off the bench at 12 is not an option because he has n’t seen him play there before does n’t add up			2
between @entity32 and @entity294 you need to cover six positions so you can not be inflexible and say @entity32 is only a fly - half			0
@entity6 need to find ways to unsettle the opposition and do the unexpected			2
if we have n’t seen @entity32 at 12 , you can guarantee @entity25 have n’t either			0
it may not have changed the outcome , but i ’d love to have seen @entity295 , @entity32 and @entity138 finish that game together .			0

@entity6 have won just six of their last eight against top opposition
they have two proper games and three friendlies before the @entity29
one of them is saturday 's @entity319 clash with @entity47 at @entity61
they must treat this and the @entity48 @entity35 games like the @entity29
@entity32 , @entity39 and @entity124 must play for @entity6
make @entity173 captain against @entity47 and rest @entity160
introduce speed to the back row *absent* in @entity329 , @entity173 and @entity188
improve kicking by luring back @entity214 's mentor @entity207
