for a split - second , it could have been the opening day of last season			0
same opposition , same score to protect and a contribution from the same player that brought the same , deafening reaction			0
deep into added time , with @entity11 clinging to a 1 - 0 lead , @entity10 hoisted a cross into the penalty area and @entity15 gasped for breath			1
through a sea of red shirts , @entity17 appeared to pluck the ball from the sky and spark a thunderous ovation			1
the reaction from the home support , however , was mixed with relief			0
@entity17 had previously came for but missed a number of balls slung in his direction and irony could be detected in the cheering			1
when referee @entity48 brought a tense contest to an end shortly after , @entity17 stood on the edge of the box , punching the air in celebration			1
his emotions needed no explanation			0
a weight had been lifted			0
when @entity38 arrived at @entity15 in august 2013 , @entity17 made an immediate impression on his debut , saving an added - time penalty from @entity61			1
that plunging stop launched @entity11 ’s push for the title and it was the best possible introduction to his new fans			2
he once described that as the ‘ best moment of his career ’ but , highlights have been few since			0
@entity11 are used to charismatic no 1s but @entity17 , for much of 2014 , has done nothing but spread anxiety			1
it meant the circumstances had significantly changed for this visit from @entity38			2
@entity17 had a huge question to answer , aware the criticism of him — most notably from former @entity11 keeper @entity78 — had been stinging			1
@entity17 saved a penalty from @entity61 on his debut for @entity11 at the start of last season the @entity84 goalkeeper celebrates with a fist pump after assuring @entity11 of a 1 - 0 win in the game he celebrates vociferously with team - mates @entity89 ( left ) and @entity90 having spoken to @entity32 on friday , @entity17 — whose error against @entity92 in the @entity93 ensured the spotlight was shining on him — knew that he had to produce			1
that was n’t always the case			0
he was heckled by @entity97 at one point when he dithered over a goal kick ; his kicking , as a whole , was n’t always assured and his decision making was hesitant , notably in the second half when he allowed @entity104 to close in on him			0
as the pressure mounted , though , @entity17 produced , not least with a fabulous fingertip save to tip over a @entity109 volley			2
then , as @entity38 tried to salvage a point , he made that catch and all was right in his world			2
the question is how long it will stay that way .			0

@entity17 has struggled since taking the no 1 *jersey* at @entity11
was *unconvincing* on several *occasions* against @entity38 on saturday
@entity32 had spoken to him after draw with @entity92
@entity44 scored the winner as @entity11 beat @entity38 1 - 0 at @entity15
