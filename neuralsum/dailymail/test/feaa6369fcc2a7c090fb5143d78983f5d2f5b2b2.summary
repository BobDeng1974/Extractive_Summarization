these are the pictures taken by an unforgiving regime of the men , women and children caught trying to escape its suffocating clutches and then forced to re-enact their ordeal for the cameras of the secret police			1
' @entity10 ' - the @entity11 better known as the ' @entity11 ' during the 40 year existence of the @entity14 state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as evidence in the show trials against those they caught			1
they were also thought to have been used for training purposes for border guards and trainee agents intended to inculcate in them awareness of the lengths people would go to in order to try to escape the workers ' paradise that was the @entity14			1
' of course when i saw these photos of families for the first time i was reminded of @entity61 , ' he said , referring to the prison in @entity63 where @entity65 gaolers humiliated their prisoners for amusement and captured the images of their degradation on camera			0
@entity51 found the remarkable photos in a box at the @entity73 in @entity74 , where mile upon mile of yellowing paperwork - the files of the secret policemen which they managed to neither burn or shred in the @entity14 state 's dying hours - now reside			1
together , they constitute a fascinating if grim epitaph to a nation which erected the @entity82 to hermetically seal in its citizens			0
one of the photos shows a man sitting in a homemade raft made out of polystyrene slabs , nylon rope , and wooden boards			0
he was transporting it to the @entity92 near the @entity14 resort of @entity94 on july 9 , 1981 , when he was apprehended , tried and flung into prison			0
simple : a picture of a ladder , which some desperate person had used to try to escape to the @entity100 creativity : the ingenuity of people trying to escape was remarkable : one picture shows a girl hiding in a gearbox compartment , while others simply show the vehicle in which they tried to make their escape evidence : other pictures , like these blood stained tops , look more like a picture which might be taken by police for use in a court case today another is of a primitive float constructed out of a car tyre inner tube , a fan motor and car battery			1
the craft was assembled by a man who worked in a factory which made @entity126 cars			2
he intended also to sail from @entity94 to get to the west on june 26 , 1989			0
but he was apprehended before he hit the shoreline and also ended up in jail			0
collection : all the pictures have now been brought together in a book by the photographer @entity51 one of the more poignant photos shows a young boy standing outside a car with its boot open , his sister forced to lie inside , just as she was found when their car was stopped at @entity141 in @entity74 as it headed west on september 12 1983			1
it is believed the children were sent to a @entity11 orphanage , their mother arrested			2
also caught in the cold glare of the @entity11 photographic lens was an @entity14 family and their @entity74 escape helpers , @entity152 and @entity153 , who tried to smuggle them west in an @entity156 car on september 21 , 1973			1
the ingenuity of the people smugglers knew no bounds			2
one of the photos shows a young girl lying in the gearbox compartment at the front of a @entity164 on september 9 , 1965 , as two @entity65 soldiers attempted to get her through the border to the west			0
tunnels , people caught in vans , others caught in car boots as well as models of the @entity174 speak from the pages of the book : silent witnesses to an unforgicing system which killed hundreds and imprisoned thousands more before it imploded in 1989			1
@entity51 said : ' many of these pictures were surely made within the kind of standard crime investigation routine you can find all over the world			2
' in these reenactments i suspect that the @entity14 authorities wanted to at least keep up the semblance of the rule of law , by giving state prosecutors visual evidence , even if a later trial verdict was already pretty certain at the time of arrest			0
' i would say that the humiliation caused by this form of documentation was more like collateral damage , and that it was accepted as simply part of the process			0
