by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 8 august 2013 the furthest look back through time yet – 100 years to 300,000 years after the @entity2 – has provided enticing new clues as to what might have happened			2
@entity6 researchers have conducted an extensive analysis of the thermal radiation left over from the @entity2 , also known as cosmic microwave background ( @entity10 ) radiation			1
their analysis supports the theory that the @entity2 occurred between 13.798 and 0.037 billion years ago , creating our subsequent @entity14			2
@entity6 researchers have conducted an extensive analysis of the thermal radiation left over from the @entity2 , also known as cosmic microwave background ( @entity10 ) radiation			1
the structure of the @entity10 , the oldest light in the universe , is displayed in the high - latitude regions of the map			0
the central band is the plane of our @entity25 ‘ we found that the standard picture of an early universe , in which radiation domination was followed by matter domination , holds to the level we can test it with the new data , ’ said @entity27 , a theoretical physicist at the @entity28			1
‘ but there are hints that radiation did n't give way to matter exactly as expected , ’ he added			1
‘ there appears to be an excess dash of radiation that is not due to @entity10 photons			2
’ currently , our knowledge of the @entity2 and the early formation of the universe stems almost entirely from measurements of the @entity10			0
these are primordial photons set free when the universe cooled enough for particles of radiation and particles of matter to separate			0
the elusive subatomic neutrino tracks showing electrons and muons caught in a nano second			0
neutrinos are the second most populous residents of today 's universe , after photons these measurements reveal the @entity10 's influence on the growth and development of the large - scale structure we see in the universe today			0
using the latest satellite data from the @entity71 's @entity70 mission and @entity73 's @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , @entity27 , working with @entity74 and @entity75 , analysed @entity10 measurements to higher resolution , lower noise , and more sky coverage than ever before			0
‘ with the @entity70 and @entity72 data we 're really pushing back the frontier and looking further back in the history of the universe , to regions of high energy physics we previously could not access , ’ said @entity27			0
‘ while our analysis shows the @entity10 photon relic afterglow of the @entity2 being followed mainly by dark matter as expected , there was also a deviation from the standard that hints at relativistic particles beyond @entity10 light			1
’ this map shows the oldest light in our universe , as detected with the greatest precision yet			0
the ancient light , called the cosmic microwave background , was imprinted on the sky when the universe was 370,000 years old			0
it shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities @entity27 suggests the reason behind these relativistic particles are early versions of neutrinos , the phantom - like subatomic particles that are the second most populous residents of today 's universe			2
another theory is dark energy , the anti-gravitational force that accelerates our universe 's expansion			2
‘ early dark energy is a class of explanations for the origin of cosmic acceleration that arises in some high energy physics models , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ while conventional dark energy , such as the cosmological constant , are diluted to one part in a billion of total energy density around the time of the @entity10 's last scattering , early dark energy theories can have 1 - to - 10 million times more energy density			1
’ @entity27 believes early dark energy could have been the driver that seven billion years later caused the present cosmic acceleration			1
its actual discovery would not only provide new insight into the origin of cosmic acceleration , but perhaps also provide new evidence for string theory and other concepts in high energy physics			1
‘ new experiments for measuring @entity10 polarisation that are already underway , such as the @entity149 and @entity150 telescopes , will enable us to further explore primeval physics , ’ @entity27 said .			0

study *involved* an analysis of thermal radiation left over from the @entity2
data suggests that radiation did n't give way to matter exactly as expected
the excess radiation found may have been due to early neutrinos or dark energy - providing a new insight into the origin of cosmic acceleration
