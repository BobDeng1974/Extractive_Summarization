by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:19 pm on 21st september 2011 president @entity2 will today make a desperate push for the @entity4 to drop a statehood bid when he addresses the @entity6 today			1
@entity2 will follow up his speech with separate meetings with @entity10 and @entity4 leaders as he seeks to coax both parties back to direct peace talks			1
but as @entity15 officials attempt to steer @entity16 away , unrest was growing in the @entity17 today from residents calling for independence			1
president @entity2 will try to talk @entity4 president @entity20 out of an official push for statehood the talks come as several thousand @entity4 streamed into the center of this @entity17 city today in a show of support for their president 's bid to win @entity6 recognition of a @entity4 state			1
the rally , in a small square in downtown @entity35 , was carefully orchestrated , with civil servants and schoolchildren given time off to participate			0
crowds of youths hoisted @entity4 flags and chanted slogans calling for the establishment of an independent @entity16			1
at the same time , @entity15 officials are conceding that they probably can not prevent @entity4 leader @entity20 from moving forward with a request to the @entity45 for full @entity4 membership			1
recognizing that @entity20 seems intent to proceed , @entity2 is expected to privately ask the @entity4 leader to essentially drop the move for statehood recognition after @entity20 delivers a formal letter of intent to the @entity6 on friday			1
religious unrest : @entity4 demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning trash bin during clashes with @entity10 soldiers today violence : a @entity4 holds a slingshot as others roll tires to burn during clashes with @entity10 soldiers , at the @entity65 checkpoint between the @entity17 city of @entity35 and @entity67 ' the president will say , frankly , the same thing in private that he 'll say in public , which is that we do not believe that this is the best course of action for achieving @entity4 aspirations , ' @entity69 deputy national security adviser @entity68 said			1
@entity2 will also meet today with @entity10 prime minister @entity78			2
the @entity2 administration has pledged to veto any @entity4 statehood bid , arguing that only direct peace negotiations , not a @entity6 vote , would allow the @entity4 to achieve the benefits of statehood			1
with peace talks stalled , the @entity15 and international partners have been negotiating intensely this week over the steps it would take to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table			0
the new approach being considered would see the ' quartet ' of @entity100 peace mediators - the @entity15 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 - issue a statement addressing both @entity4 and @entity10 concerns and setting a timetable for a return to the long - stalled peace talks , officials close to the diplomatic talks said			2
talks : @entity106 president @entity105 , left , meets with mr @entity20 in @entity107 during the 66th session of the @entity6 yesterday discussions : mr @entity20 ( right ) and his delegation sit with @entity6 secretary - general @entity111 ( left ) during a @entity6 meeting earlier this week @entity10 would have to accept its pre- 1967 borders with land exchanges as the basis for a two - state solution , and the @entity4 would have to recognize @entity10 's @entity119 character if they were to reach a deal quickly , officials close to the talks said			1
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing diplomacy			0
the @entity69 publicly appeared to hold out slight hope that enough progress could be made to stop @entity20 from formally requesting statehood recognition			2
' president @entity20 has indicated his determination to go to the @entity45 , so we take him at his word on that , ' @entity68 said			2
today 's march appeared subdued , with many people using the day off to mingle and do some window shopping			0
while turnout was modest , participants said the gathering sent an important message			0
' we want to live in dignity , ' said @entity142 , a 60 - year - old shopkeeper			0
he said it was important that the @entity6 recognize the @entity4 cause , even if there are repercussions , such as a possible cut in @entity15 aid			0
' we do n't need the @entity15 to buy us with money , ' he said			0
a new poll indicated there is overwhelming popular support for @entity20 ' recognition quest			2
tense : @entity10 border police walk past t - shirts with slogans calling for statehood recognition support : @entity4 children hold flags and posters during a rally for @entity6 membership in the @entity17			1
the @entity15 has threatened to veto the bid some 83 percent of @entity4 believe it 's a good idea , even though nearly as many - 78 percent - say they expect it will make their daily lives more difficult , according to a new poll by the independent @entity169			2
the survey , conducted last week , included 1,200 respondents and had an error margin of 3 percentage points.the @entity6 bid is seen by many @entity4 as a last option , after two uprisings and two decades of negotiations with @entity10 failed to produce a state , said pollster @entity178			2
" it 's simply a belief that the status quo is worse than the worst that can come out of the @entity6 , " he said			0
the simmering situation is far from the scenario @entity2 envisioned when he spoke at the @entity6 one year ago			0
' we should reach for what 's best within ourselves , ' @entity2 said last september in pushing for negotiated agreement on a sovereign @entity4 state			1
' if we do , when we come back here next year , we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the @entity102			0
' while the @entity4 statehood bid has overshadowed @entity2 's time at the @entity6 , he is also expected to use his speech to the international body to reflect on the sweeping changes in the world over the past year , most notably in the @entity200 world			1
@entity68 said the president also would highlight significant foreign policy developments for the @entity15 , such as drawing down the wars in @entity204 and @entity205 , as well as the killing of @entity207			0
@entity2 on wednesday also planned to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the @entity6			0
