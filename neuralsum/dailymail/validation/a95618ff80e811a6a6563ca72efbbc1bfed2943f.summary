the latest list of @entity2 's top 10 tourist destinations has the usual suspects of capital cities and beach side locations but an old mining town in @entity7 has made an unexpected appearance			1
@entity9 , about two hours north of @entity10 , slipped in at number 10 on @entity13 's list ahead of one of @entity2 's most popular tourist attractions - the @entity16 in @entity17			1
the sleepy town attracts about 30,000 visitors every year with its biggest drawcard being the gateway to the @entity7 ' @entity23 wine region			1
in stark contrast , the @entity16 pulls in a whopping 12million tourists each year to visit the variety of theme parks and sunny beaches it is so well known for			2
however , instead of the list being complied by comparing the number of people who have visited the destinations - the quality and quantity of the reviews on the site were analysed			2
@entity9 , which is the gateway to the @entity39 ( pictured ) , was listed number ten in @entity13 's top 10 tourist destinations of @entity2 although the @entity16 pulls 12million people each year for its sunny beaches and theme parks - it did n't make it into the top ten tourist spots @entity49 chief executive @entity48 said the ranking of reviews was not indicative of the millions of visitors to the @entity16 every year it comes as no great surprise that arguably @entity2 's most famous capital city , @entity10 , came in at number one followed by fellow capital cities @entity58 and @entity59			1
sunny beach spots rated highly with @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 also listed in the country 's top ten holiday destinations			1
@entity67 and @entity68 came in at sixth and ninth respectively - leaving just @entity70 and @entity71 the only remaining capital cities not to make into the fave locations			1
evidently the reviewers who jump on the @entity13 site to give their opinion of their holiday experiences prefer a relaxed winery tour over the adrenalin - filled fun at amusement parks			0
it comes as no surprise that arguably @entity2 's most famous capital city , @entity10 , was ranked number one @entity58 came runner up for its art , haute boutiques , multicultural dining and the pulsing and swanky nightlife @entity59 was ranked number three for being the hub of @entity17 culture both past and present the other attractions in @entity9 mentioned on the site aside from the abundant vineyards are ' world - class golf courses , gourmet eateries , lush gardens and blissful spas '			1
@entity49 chief executive @entity48 said he was ' absolutely ' surprised that the @entity16 did not make the list			0
' we dismiss the illicit comment outright , ' he told @entity102			0
' it 's pretty clear that this is sample is flawed and even though consumers make independent comment that does n't have anything to do with the overall attractiveness of the destination			0
' our international visitation was 13 per cent last year so we must be doing something right in the minds of most consumers			0
' @entity61 made fourth spot for being the perfect city for merry revelers , passionate divers and adrenaline junkies , offering booming nightlife and heart - pounding adventure amid a vibrant and tropical setting @entity62 was voted in at number 5 for its perfect base in @entity17 for exploring the @entity126 , the @entity128 rainforest and the beaches at @entity130 - or just being pampered at day spas the lively city of @entity67 took out sixth spot for its unique mash - up of the 19th and 21st centuries , the waterfront cafes and restaurants that overlook a harbour bustling with yachts and fishing boats 1			2
@entity9 mr @entity48 said @entity9 being included in the top 10 was a perfect example to illustrate his point			2
' not taking anything away from the beautiful @entity9 but clearly the sample size and the cohort that responds to @entity13 is not representative of the millions of people who have wonderful holidays throughout @entity2 on an annual basis , ' he said			0
@entity9 mayor @entity151 said the quality of the visit to his hometown made for a positive experience for people			0
' when you compare the @entity16 experience to a vineyard tranquility - whether it be wine tasting , golf , ballooning or just chilling out in the big city - we are attractive , ' he told @entity102			0
' we hosted @entity163 for a pre-training camp in the @entity165 and the number of world class acts across the concert season is another attraction so people go away and say " i love that and i 'm going to come back "			0
' known as much for its wine region as the idyllic surf spot - @entity63 in @entity2 came seventh the luxurious town of @entity64 on @entity17 's @entity176 came in at number eight on the list @entity180 's capital city of @entity68 was ranked number nine for its enchanting treasure trove of shopping , fine arts , gastronomy and outdoor activity last but definitely not least - @entity9 which the mayors says is always a positive experience for visitors			1

old mining town of @entity9 came in at number 10 over the @entity16 in @entity194 's top 10 tourist destinations across @entity2
gateway to @entity198 wine region is preferred by the reviewers more than the popular theme parks visited by 12million people every year
the sleepy town of @entity9 only attracts about 30,000 visitors every year
@entity10 comes in at number one followed by @entity58 and @entity59
fellow capital cities @entity67 and @entity68 came in at sixth and ninth
