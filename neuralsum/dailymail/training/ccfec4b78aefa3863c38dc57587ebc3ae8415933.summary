the menu features breadsticks , ice - cream , chips , and handmade cheeses with apple and ginger chutney			2
so far , so ordinary			2
but closer investigation reveals that all is not what it seems			2
the breadsticks are made from ground almonds , the salted caramel ice - cream has coconut cream and honey instead of milk , chips are cut from carrots and those cheeses ... well , there 's not an ounce of dairy in there as they are made with nuts			1
pastured and wild meat , seafood , nuts , seeds , eggs , plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily			2
the basic premise of the @entity26 diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics , which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years			1
it is said to be much better than the grains , dairy , and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution			1
while they may not be most conventional of ingredients to feature in kitchens , they are the most used items in the kitchens of the @entity27 's first @entity26 restaurant , @entity28			1

focusing on food groups generally consumed during the paleolithic era , @entity28 restaurant in @entity29 , @entity30 , has a menu that excludes dairy products , grains , legumes , processed oils or refined sugars , in favour of protein - rich and high - fibre options			1
pudding with a difference : quinoa pancakes with blueberries , honey and cinnamon each item on the carefully curated menu has a string of letters underneath it			2
as well as notations indicating gluten , and dairy - free items , together with the more conventional vegetarian and vegan indicators , these letters explain each menu item and what the diet it is compliant with			1

' our extensive menus are a testament of our commitment to providing exceptional food and exhibiting the benefits of paleo cooking			0
’ dr @entity155 , associate professor of nutrition at the @entity156 , explained : ‘ nuts are essentially the seeds of nut trees – apart from peanuts , which are related to peas , not nuts			0
‘ when you soak seeds , including nuts , in water , two phenomena occur : leaching of protease inhibitors [ molecules that inhibit digestion ] into the water and activating of the germination process , so the amount of starch and fibre reduces , while the protein and vitamin content raise			0
‘ this is why germinating seeds and nuts are easier to digest than dry , raw nuts			0
however , most nuts bought at @entity27 supermarkets have been blanched [ quickly cooked in boiling water ] or roasted , which also inactivates the protease inhibitors			1
‘ roasted nuts are not alive any more , so they will not activate			0

tapioca and almond flour as well as almond and coconut milk are used in all the dishes			0
' one of the biggest challenges in achieving optimal health is discovering what works best for you			0
we create dishes around the foods you can eat , rather than the foods you ca n’t , ' ms @entity135 said			0
@entity110 : low - carbohydrate diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption			0
they ’re often chosen to assist weight loss , aid blood sugar management or for a specific medical reason			0
