' the only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports			0
we asked him if he liked basketball and he said he did n’t know what that was			0
' but when we took him to play with other people he picked up the ball and knew exactly what to do			0
’ @entity10 said : ‘ the last few weeks have been truly horrible			1
i go through so many emotions			0
