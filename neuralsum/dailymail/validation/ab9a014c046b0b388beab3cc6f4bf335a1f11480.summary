radical new proposals including law changes and possible punishments for team doctors are being drawn up in a bid to halt a shocking 900 per cent increase in reported concussions ahead of this year ’s @entity7			1
high - profile incidents suffered by players during the current @entity10 — including @entity13 wing @entity11 , @entity15 full - back @entity14 and @entity17 flanker @entity16 — have reignited concerns over the extent of concussion in professional rugby and how the potentially fatal injury is handled			1
a recent @entity24 audit revealed reported rates of concussion were 59 per cent higher during the 2013 - 14 @entity27 season than the previous year , with 10.5 concussions occurring every 1,000 player hours			1
full - back @entity14 suffered a heavy blow to the head in @entity15 's victory over @entity34 but figures seen by @entity36 show the rate of reported concussions for the current @entity10 stand at 25 per 1,000 player hours after three rounds — more than double the @entity24 ’s figure and almost 10 times the number reported a decade ago			1
‘ it ’s a massively high number and it ’s causing significant concern across the sport , ’ said one insider at the governing body , @entity46			2
‘ something needs to be done because the @entity7 is coming up and the eyes of the world will be on rugby			0
concussion is unquestionably the biggest issue facing the sport			2
’ significant strides have been made by the sport ’s governing bodies in recent times , with a compulsory education programme introduced in the @entity27 at the start of this season and a gradual introduction of pitch - side video technology for medics to access			1
@entity14 was ruled out of @entity17 game after failing stage three of the return to play concussion protocol – a process all players must undergo after suffering head injuries @entity46 bosses , aware of potentially damaging long - term effects of multiple concussions to players and desperate to avoid potentially crippling legal action seen in the @entity79 , have also instituted an extensive education programme			1
and they are in the processes of drawing up a legally binding document to ensure strict player welfare guidelines are adhered to at the @entity7			0
but there are fears the current measures do not go far enough and @entity36 understands @entity46 chiefs have agreed the introduction of further medical protocols ahead of the @entity7 which include : @entity13 admitted @entity11 should have been removed from play after being knocked unconscious rugby union has been on high alert since the @entity79 agreed to pay out close to a billion dollars to more than 4,000 former gridiron stars with neurodegenerative conditions linked to multiple concussions and the latest figures will do little to ease concern			1
this week , @entity46 ’s head of medicine dr @entity98 presented to the world governing body ’s executive committee when the proposal to draw up a worldwide group of players , coaches , referees , doctors and medics with a remit to look at law changes to reduce concussion rates was ratified			1
‘ we are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem , ’ said dr @entity98			0
‘ if we had started the prevention programmes five years ago , we would have been saying , “ we need to get it down from five [ concussions per 1,000 hours ]			0
now we know it ’s going to be at least 10.5 if not more and i think we ’ll see another increase			0
we are getting far better compliance around concussion but we do n’t believe we have finished this process			0
we ’ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area			0
if there ’s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we ’ll investigate it			0
’ there was widespread criticism of the @entity13 medical team for failing to spot two incidents in which @entity11 appeared to be knocked unconscious but was allowed to play on			2
a world rugby concussion panel — comprising dr @entity98 and some of the world ’s leading brain injury experts — accepted the @entity141 medical team ’s explanation that they were unsighted for both incidents , although questions remain as to why no one among the team ’s backroom staff , some with access to @entity149 broadcast footage , alerted the medics			1
‘ the @entity141 did n’t have to co-operate but they were extremely co-operative , ’ said @entity98			0
‘ they were also extremely embarrassed about what happened			0
’ concerns also persist that so - called ‘ independent ’ match - day doctors in the @entity10 are often employees of the home union and therefore highly unlikely to challenge or even over-rule a team doctor if they believe a serious breach in protocol has occurred			1
‘ they will have to be fully independent match - day doctors at the @entity7 , ’ said @entity98			2
‘ every other match day appointment is independent so why not doctors ? imagine if @entity15 were playing @entity165 and the match - day doctor was @entity167 and decided that @entity168 should come off with 20 minutes left even if the @entity165 team doctors said he was fine			2
there would be absolute outcry			0
we have to avoid that scenario			0
‘ the match day doctor has the ability to over-rule team doctors but i ’d hope they would look to work together			1
’ @entity177 have announced a new research programme to investigate effects of concussion on their players , while @entity183 are also trialling micro-chip technology to assess the extent of forces their players are being exposed to .			2
