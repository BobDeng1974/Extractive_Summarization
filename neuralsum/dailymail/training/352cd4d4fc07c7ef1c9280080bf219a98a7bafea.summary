by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 09:15 est , 26 june 2012 a mother embezzled more than $ 10million from the car dealership where she worked and spent it over six years on luxury trips , extravagant presents and once - in - a - lifetime experiences			1
@entity6 splashed millions of dollars on vip tickets to see the @entity8 , a costume fitting and cameo performance in @entity10 and a gourmet lunch cooked and hosted by celebrity chef @entity12 ' @entity13 at her @entity15 home			2
the 58 - year - old , who worked at the @entity18 car dealership in @entity19 , was jailed for six - and - a - half years on wednesday			1
the elaborate theft drew similarities with the @entity22 - where a car dealership employee fakes a kidnapping in an attempt to extort millions - except @entity6 's crimes were solely white collar			1
convicted : @entity6 , 58 , stole $ 10million over the course of six years , and now she faces that same amount of time behind bars after being found guilty of wire fraud @entity6 worked as a controller at the @entity18 dealership and fudged business records and made illegal bank transfers that amounted to over $ 10million extra dollars in her bank account			1
when broken down over time , @entity38 reports that equates to her pocketing $ 4,000 every day during her six - year - crime spree			2
in court , @entity6 was extremely apologetic and sobbed to the judge after being charged with wire fraud			2
the district attorney reported that @entity6 made over 800 deposits from the company 's accounts into her own accounts since 2004			0
local station @entity49 said that she cited an incurable need for approval by her family and friends as the reason for embezzling			0
@entity6 said that she felt like a ' horrible daughter , wife , mother and friend ' and used the gifts and trips to ' earn their love '			0
her lawyer put it another way , saying that she had an abusive childhood that lead to a gambling addiction and propensity to overspend			0
for the love : @entity6 said that she spent the millions on gifts for her family to ' earn their love ' , like she did when she got four luxury tickets to the @entity74 a holy visit : she bought private tours of the @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 , along with vip seats at a @entity80 attended by the @entity8 ( like the one on the right ) she ' wanted to see what happiness looked like ' and she appeared to have a varied interpretation of the good life			2
she spent $ 1.8million on private jets to seven different @entity87 countries and four @entity89 islands along with hour homes in @entity91 , @entity19 , the beach town of @entity92 , and a residence in @entity94 , @entity95			0
when she was n't busy traveling abroad or resting in her homes , @entity6 treated herself and her friends to unique experiences			0
she spent $ 44,500 on four well - placed tickets to the @entity100 in 2011 and $ 32,500 for a six - person lunch cooked by @entity103 star @entity102 in the home where she hosts her television show			2
serious spending : @entity6 bought a first - edition @entity108 book ( like the one on the left ) and paid $ 32,500 for tv chef @entity102 ( right ) to cook a luncheon for she and five friends at @entity102 's @entity114 home perhaps feeling as if she needed to repent for some of her illegal activity , @entity6 paid $ 5,000 for ' the @entity77 package ' which featured plane tickets for four to @entity119 , a private tour of the @entity77 and @entity78 as well as seats to a @entity80 in the @entity8 audience			1
another bizarre purchase was the $ 2,500 she spent to have a costume and wig fitting at @entity10 play along with the chance to make an appearance on stage during the @entity130 sequence while four of her friends watched on in the audience			0
@entity6 was nâ€™t above accumulating physical possessions either , buying a first - edition @entity108 book , a baby grand piano , flat screen televisions , suvs and a @entity138 convertible			1
left in the lurch : the @entity18 car dealership will only receive about $ 1million back from the $ 10million that she stole during her tenure as their controller the district attorney said that @entity6 was apologetic and thanked them for the compassion that both they and the @entity150 's office showed during the investigation			1
along with the next six years that @entity6 will spend behind bars , the dealership also lost out because of the embezzlement : they will only be reimbursed for about $ 1million of the $ 10million that she took			1
' we 're glad that justice has been served and this matter is now behind us , ' the management team said in a statement			0
' our business is doing well and we have adopted stronger measures to prevent such a crime from ever happening again			0
