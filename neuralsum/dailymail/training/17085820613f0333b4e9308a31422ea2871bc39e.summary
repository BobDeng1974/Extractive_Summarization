by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 22:44 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 02:22 est , 2 may 2013 when @entity3 's college friend sent a text warning the @entity7 bomber that his fast was all over the news , 19 - year - old @entity3 responded with ' lol ' - universal text message - speak for a joke			1
@entity3 then told his pal @entity13 : ' you better not text me			2
' @entity13 is one of three of @entity3 's college friends arrested on wednesday by federal authorities and accused of trying to cover the suspected terrorist 's tracks by throwing away his computer and a backpack full of firearms			1
@entity13 and @entity24 , both @entity26 nationals , were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence			1
an @entity30 named @entity29 is charged with knowingly and willfully making false statements to investigators			1
according to the criminal complaint from federal authorities , @entity13 sent a text message to @entity3 on april 18 after the @entity55 released surveillance images of him at the @entity57 with his brother @entity58			2
@entity13 warned his friend that that he was plastered across tv news			0
' @entity3 ’s return texts contained ‘ lol ’ and other things @entity63 interpreted as jokes , ' documents say			0
he also wrote : ' you better not text me ’ and ‘ come to my room and take whatever you want ' @entity13 and @entity24 had already been in police custody for more than a week at the time of their arrest because they were previously questioned about their license plate that reads ‘ @entity76 ’			1
authorities then held them on immigration issues because they are in the country illegally after their academic visas expired			2
the nature of these charges suggests that none of these young men helped plan the fatal @entity57 bombing , which left three dead and more than 200 injured , but they did work to cover @entity3 ’s tracks from investigators and evade capture			1
the detailed criminal complaint goes through the timeline of events according to each of the 19 - year - olds , all of whom met @entity3 when they started school at @entity50 in the same semester in the fall of 2011			1
like many throughout @entity7 , none of the three boys had any inkling that @entity3 was involved until the @entity55 released pictures of the two suspects , later identified as 19 - year - old @entity3 and his 26 - year - old brother @entity58			1
friends in low places : @entity13 and @entity24 ( left and center ) were identified as the two friends of @entity3 ( right ) who have been held in @entity7 jail since april 20 the @entity30 : @entity29 , who was identified as this student by @entity113 , was arrested on wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation on the same day that the @entity55 released pictures and video clips of the @entity3 brothers at the bomb scene , @entity13 and @entity24 removed items from the younger bomber 's dorm room			1
that was just two days before the @entity55 searched the room			0
the criminal complaint lists that they removed @entity3 's backpack from his room and ' agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that @entity3 was one of the @entity57 bombers			0
' prison : the maximum sentence for @entity29 ' charge of lying to federal officers , is eight years in jail as opposed to the other suspects who face five years the three friends - @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity29 - went over to @entity3 's on - campus dormitory after seeing the news reports			1
when the group arrived at the dorm , @entity13 showed @entity24 a text from the bomber that said ' i 'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it			2
' he did not specify where he was going , but @entity24 told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see @entity3 alive again			2
they were let in the room by @entity157 's roommate , who said that @entity3 had been there just a few hours earlier			0
the criminal complaint says that when there , the three friends watched a movie			0
@entity13 ' knew when he saw the empty fireworks that @entity3 was involved in the @entity57 bombing			2
@entity24 was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed , meaning that @entity3 could have either used the explosives or planned to use them			2
@entity13 found @entity168 in the room , which he told the others @entity3 used to make bombs			2
charged : @entity13 , left , and @entity24 , right , appeared in court together and waived their right to a bail hearing , meaning that they will remain in the jail until their next hearing on may 14 at one point in the police interviews , @entity178 said that during a meal a month before the attack , @entity3 told he and @entity183 that he knew how to make a bomb			1
@entity13 was reportedly the one who ' decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his friend @entity3 avoid trouble			2
' in a slightly unexpected explanation , @entity13 says that he took @entity3 's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that he was ' stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack '			0
though the release of the photos is the first time that alarm bells went off in the students ’ minds , it is not the first time that they interacted with the bomber since monday april 15			0
close : @entity24 , seen here with bomber @entity3 in an undated picture , told police that about a month before the @entity57 attack , @entity3 said that he knew how to make a bomb texts : when the group arrived at the dorm , @entity13 ( left ) showed @entity24 ( right ) a text from the bomber that said ' i 'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it ' happier times : @entity13 told investigators that he suggested they take @entity3 's backpack and his laptop from the room , and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off - campus apartment both @entity13 and @entity24 - who shared an apartment in @entity230 - spent time with @entity3 two days after the bombing			1
@entity3 met with @entity13 briefly , where @entity13 noted that @entity3 ' appeared to have given himself a short haircut '			0
@entity234 told police that he spent more time with @entity237 earlier that same day , when @entity3 drove him to his off - campus apartment after class and then they spent time hanging out in the apartment			0
hunting for clues : the students reportedly disposed of materials for @entity3 at the garbage can at their house , which was transported to the @entity246 landfill , just nine miles from the @entity50 campus first suspects : @entity3 and @entity237 were identified as the first suspects during multiple interviews , @entity29 lied about various parts of the story - at first saying that he never went to @entity3 's dorm room , then saying that they did n't remove anything , then saying that they went to the dorm but it was locked and they never entered			1
after repeating false versions of the same story , he recanted his previous testimony in the fourth interview on april 26			0
the gravity of the situation did not appear to hit @entity29 until after the trio returned to the off - campus apartment and they ' started to freak out , because it became clear from a @entity113 report that we were watching that @entity270 was one of the @entity57 bombers			0
' the @entity7 police were the first to announce the arrests via @entity274 , and they followed up their initial tweet by confirming that there is no threat to public safety			1
red flag : police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates ( pictured ) but then held them on immigration charges since they are @entity26 nationals in the country on expired academic visas the news of the arrests comes one day after the elder suspect @entity237 ’s wife @entity291 was interviewed by investigators after they spent hours searching her home			1
@entity55 official first linked the bombings to brothers @entity3 and @entity237 , releasing photos of the pair last thursday , three days after the fatal blast killed three and injured more than 250 people at the finish line of the @entity57			0
they were able to confirm the identity of the two after the photos were released , and later that evening @entity58 died after an altercation with police where he opened fire on officers and his younger brother ended up driving over him in the getaway car			0
college friends : the first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with @entity3 at @entity50 and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact @entity3 was arrested the following day after a city - wide manhunt lead to his discovery inside a boat in @entity323 , @entity324			1
@entity3 was arrested and transported to an area hospital where he remains in police custody			0
he was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction , though the legal proceedings came into question after police initially interviewed him - and he allegedly confessed - before he was read his @entity333 rights			0
after hearing his rights , he reportedly stopped talking to police .			0
