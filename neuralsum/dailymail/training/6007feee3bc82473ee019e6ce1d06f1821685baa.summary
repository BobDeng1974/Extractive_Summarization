by @entity1 reporter published : 22:12 est , 23 february 2014 @entity3 : 08:52 est , 24 february 2014 for @entity5 , the @entity4 will be forever known as the ' @entity6 ' after a string of previously unknowns compensated for the failure of big names including @entity11 , @entity12 and the men 's hockey team to bring home the gold			1
@entity19 @entity18 officials have been forced to defend its ‘ disappointing ’ medal haul at @entity4 , which has fallen short of the record 37 medal haul in @entity23 four years ago			1
@entity19 placed fourth in the gold medal tally behind host country @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 with just nine golds , but came in a more respectable second with its overall medal haul			1
dig the new breed : weeks ago they were unknowns but then @entity34 , left , and @entity35 , right , struck gold for @entity5 at the @entity37 with so many big names failing to deliver , it was left to a number of young and unknown talents to emerge at these games			1
@entity4 marked the debut of 12 @entity18 events , and the @entity19 medaled in seven of them including team figure skating , women 's ski slopestyle and halfpipe , and men 's ski halfpipe			1
some of the winners might have been familiar to fans of action sports , but their victories in @entity26 introduced them to a broader audience			2
one of @entity19 ’s new heroes was @entity58 , a little - known snowboarder from @entity59 whose surprise gold medal in the new slopestyle event was @entity5 ’s first gold in 2014			1
@entity58 of the @entity64 team poses with members of the @entity66 after winning the first @entity19 gold at the @entity4 other members of the new bred included ski slopestyle champion @entity35 and 18 - year - old @entity34 who won the slalom			1
the country 's poor show in the speedskating , hockey and figure skating has been blamed for its rankings drop , with this year 's medal haul about 20 percent lower than the 2010 @entity23 total			1
yet despite @entity26 's dominance , @entity19 officials argue this was one of @entity19 's best games ever			1
' i could n't be more proud of our @entity18 team , ' @entity84 chairman @entity83 said			0
a bronze in the four - man bobsled on a day @entity26 put an exclamation point on its games gave the @entity19 28 medals in @entity4 , putting it behind just the host country in total medals			1
but @entity27 won more gold than the @entity19 ( 11 - 9 ) and the 28 total medals were nine less than @entity19 won in a record - setting performance four years ago in @entity23			2
medal count : @entity5 came in second behind @entity26 in the total medal count , and finished fourth in the gold medal count final medal : @entity104 piloted the @entity19 to the bronze in the men 's four - man bobsled at the @entity4 , placing the @entity19 second in the @entity4 medal count that total - five less than won by @entity26 - would have been far less if @entity19 athletes did n't win nine medals , including five gold , in sports that made their debut in these games			1
to make matters worse , @entity28 won more gold medals than its much bigger neighbor for the second @entity119 in a row			0
' we came here to compete , ' said @entity123 , managing director of sport performance for the @entity84			0
' we came here with a great team and they 've done a great job			0
things do n't always shake out exactly the way you think they 're going to , but the surprises are sometimes way more surprising than the disappointments			0
' among the disappointments were the biggest @entity19 stars going into the games			2
@entity11 got shut out in snowboard and @entity138 did n't even make the trip because of injury			0
disappointing : @entity141 @entity11 arrived in @entity4 trying to win two gold medals , but left with none let down : @entity5 figure skater @entity144 became an internet sensation for her disappointed facial expression but at least one new star was born			1
teen skiing sensation @entity34 won gold in the women 's slalom and liked it so much that she was already making plans for a record - setting performance four years from now in @entity153			2
' right now , i 'm dreaming of the next @entity119 ( and ) winning five gold medals , which sounds really crazy , ' @entity34 said the day after her win			2
' i 'm sorry i just admitted that to you all			0
' @entity34 's win in her first @entity119 could n't make up for the collapse of the @entity19 speedskating team , which was blanked in old suits and new			1
talking it up : @entity19 @entity84 chairman @entity83 ( right , pictured with @entity26 president @entity164 ) insists he is ' proud ' of the @entity19 team speedskaters were kept off the medal podium for the first time since 1984 , despite a switch midway through the games back to their old suits			1
' @entity119 ever , ' two - time gold medalist @entity12 said			0
while the @entity19 failed to win a medal on the @entity4 big oval , skaters from the @entity173 piled on with eight golds and 23 medals overall in speedskating			1
' if you look at speedskating results we were n't the only nation that got smoked by the @entity173 , ' said @entity183 , ceo of the @entity84			0
however , commentators say that as the rest of the world improves its training and performance , @entity19 is lagging behind			0
@entity189 reported the decision to train at high altitude and outdoors in @entity193 before coming to an @entity119 with an indoor track at sea level became a cause of concern following the disappointing performance			0
@entity199 , the sport 's governing body in the @entity19 , has also been accused of ' losing its way '			2
' it 's like @entity204 , ' coach @entity202 told the @entity205 , citing constant infighting and frequent turnover of coaches , high - performance directors and executives			0
the @entity173 , who won a record 23 speedskating medals in @entity4 , ' have trained right by the water their whole lives and understand how to push heavy air and what tempo is required , ' one source told the @entity205			0
' our team is trying to glide and carry speed like in @entity222 and it 's not working			0
' not the clothes : @entity119 officials have dismissed claims @entity19 speedskaters performed badly because of the new uniforms made by @entity228 ( worn here by @entity12 ) trouble in paradise : @entity5 's speedskating team , including , ( pictured left to right ) @entity231 , @entity12 and @entity233 ( right ) , failed to win a single medal at @entity4 things were n't much better on the ice for @entity19 figure skaters , who won a bronze in the new team event but were shut out individually			1
@entity240 and @entity241 took a bit of the sting out of that performance with a gold medal in ice dancing			0
however commentators say the absence of a ' four - year plan ' has been blamed for the decline in @entity252 's performance in figure skating			1
@entity254 , editor - in - chief at @entity255 , said this is merely a ' lull ' or low ' cycle ' that every nation experiences			0
however @entity261 reported there is some hope for the @entity19 team , with 18 - year - old @entity265 establishing herself as a solid medal contender , while 19 - year - old @entity267 could be a threat once he masters the quadruple jump			2
' the next ( four years ) should be really interesting , ' @entity271 said after finishing fourth in women 's singles			0
winners : @entity240 and @entity241 took a bit of the sting out of the disappointing @entity19 medal tally with their gold medal - winning performance in ice dancing not so great : the @entity19 men 's hockey team , including goaltender @entity282 , left @entity4 disappointed meanwhile , both the men 's and women 's hockey team left disappointed			1
the women appeared on their way to winning gold before collapsing in the final minutes against @entity28 , while the men could n't score against either @entity28 or @entity290 , which handed the @entity19 an embarrassing 5 - 0 loss in the bronze medal game			2
on the slopes , @entity34 and @entity293 both win gold and the @entity19 took five medals , making for a respectable showing			1
but the @entity19 was shut out in the new sport of women 's ski jumping where @entity19 had looked promising , and there were no medals in either cross-country skiing or the biathlon , sports that @entity27 dominated			2
figure skater : @entity265 , 18 , has established herself as a strong medal contender in addition to winning more golds than the @entity19 , @entity27 - with a population of just five million - finished just two medals behind in the total with 26			2
@entity123 said the @entity19 medal haul was lower partly because other countries are becoming more competitive in winter sports			1
he said the team would have liked to have won more medals , but called their performance excellent anyway			0
if there is reason to be more optimistic heading toward the games in @entity153 in 2018 , team officials said it was the strong performance in new sports like ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe			0
but replicating that success in extreme sports in future @entity119 will be difficult , said @entity328 , the former chief of sport performance for the @entity84			0
' the rest of the world is catching up , ' he said .			0

@entity19 was placed second in the overall medal tally with 28 medals , behind @entity26
medal haul about 20 percent lower than in 2010 and results considered ' disappointing ' with figure skating and speedskating blamed
a lot of big names failed to deliver at @entity343 such as @entity11 and @entity12
new stars emerged to spare @entity5 's *blushes* including @entity34 , @entity58 and @entity35
