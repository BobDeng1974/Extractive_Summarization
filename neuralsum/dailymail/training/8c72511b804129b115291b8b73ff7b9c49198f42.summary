but experts warn that while insulation may save energy in the winter , it could trap in excessive heat during the summer months if badly installed			1
it poses a particular health risk for the elderly , who could ‘ die from overheating ’			2
a report by a climate research group warned ‘ @entity9 measures could create new problems in the future , with inappropriately - insulated properties experiencing poor indoor air quality and significant summer overheating ’			1
the government 's @entity9 initiative is designed to encourage home owners to install green technologies in their homes to help the environment and cut energy bills			1
however , these same energy - efficiency measures can pose a health risk in hot weather the government said it was aware of the risk and guidance is already in place to prevent inappropriate installations			1
studies suggest there may be typically around 2,000 deaths due to heat each year , compared to around 25,000 as a result of the cold			2
but according to research group @entity52 in a @entity53 , ‘ if action is not taken ’ on the issue , heat - related deaths could more than double from 2,000 to 5,000 by 2080			2
the @entity9 , launched by @entity54 , offers homeowners loans for works such as cavity wall insulation and energy - efficient boilers , in the hope of reducing their energy bill			1
households must pay for an assessment of what upgrades their house needs , which costs around £ 150			0

top floor flats in 1960s tower blocks and modern detached houses are most at risk of becoming dangerously hot inside during a heatwave , especially if they are south - facing , according to the research dr @entity72 , of @entity74 ’s department of civil and building engineering , said the risk of overheating has been overlooked in the ‘ big rush to insulate and make homes airtight ’ , particularly as the nation could face more extreme weather in the future			1
in a study with prof @entity84 , of the @entity85 , he found that heat was likely to have a ‘ significantly greater ’ impact on the elderly or infirm who were more likely to be at home during the warmest daytime hours			2
the elderly and infirm as well as people living on the top floor of 1960s tower blocks and modern detached houses are most at risk their research found that top floor flats in 1960s tower blocks , and modern detached houses were most at risk of over-heating , particularly if they were south facing			1
‘ overheating is like the little boy at the back of the class waving his hand			0
it is forgotten about because the other challenges are so big , ’ he told the @entity101			0
‘ if you are in the wrong type of house , facing the wrong way , in the wrong street and you do n’t deal with heat in the right way , it is a problem			0
‘ particularly for the elderly			0
they are going to suffer			0
@entity119 means they are going to die from overheating			0
’ @entity120 , an independent consultant in sustainable construction , said : ‘ it is a problem			0
typically @entity124 houses are built for a fairly benign climate , not to deal with extremes			0
‘ it does n’t mean you should n’t insulate these buildings , but it must be done properly			0
‘ some properties - particularly top - floor flats and anything south facing - have a tendency to overheat , so when you add insulation to the mix it can make things worse			1
but if the right ventilation is added , then the problem can be solved			0
’ a @entity141 spokesperson said : ‘ the real problem facing our nation ’s draughty homes is a lack of adequate insulation and energy efficiency in the colder months			2
the @entity9 is giving households a new way to fund improvements , helping them protect themselves against rising energy bills and keep homes warm and cosy in the autumn and winter			1
‘ if energy efficiency measures are installed appropriately , overheating should not be a common problem and there ’s guidance available for those involved in the @entity9			1

*temperatures* could reach dangerous levels in some homes fitted with energy - saving measures like insulation , installed under @entity9 scheme
point of scheme was to save winter fuel bills and protect the environment
but experts are warning that heat that builds up in the day does not easily *dissipate* at night and leads to poor air quality , which could kill
the elderly and infirm as well as people living on the top floor of 1960s tower blocks and modern detached houses are most at risk
