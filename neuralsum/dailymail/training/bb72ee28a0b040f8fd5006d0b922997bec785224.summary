by @entity0 search : detectives say they will be making ' substantial ' efforts in their hunt to find missing @entity5 over the coming weeks detectives looking for @entity5 will begin ' substantial ' work on their investigation in @entity9 within weeks			1
officers from the @entity11 are working with @entity9 police during a fresh phase of their hunt for the missing girl , who disappeared aged three on a family holiday in the resort of @entity17			1
@entity18 , the assistant commissioner of the force , said : ' in the forthcoming weeks we are going to be going to a substantial phase of operational activity on the ground in @entity9			2
' a thorough serious crime investigation works systematically through all the credible possibilities , and often in an investigation you will have more than one credible possibility '			0
however , he warned that they may not come up with answers quickly - or at all			0
the announcement came weeks after detectives were spotted using a helicopter to take aerial photos in the holiday resort where @entity37 disappeared after being left in her room by parents @entity39 and @entity41			1
police were then preparing to excavate three areas in the resort in the hope of turning up clues			2
though they were not given permission to conduct the dig themselves , experts were on hand to oversee the work - including those trained to detect bodies			2
@entity55 police officers have been negotiating with their @entity9 counterparts throughout the search			1
it is thought they have requested permission to question eight crucial witnesses in their investigation			1
however other requests - including plans to raid homes of prime suspects - were refused			0
aerial view : specialist officers are expected to examine several sites in @entity17 after permission to dig was granted by @entity9 authorities , seven years after @entity67 went missing from the area aged three mr @entity18 said : ' i want to be able to go back to @entity41 and @entity39 at some stage in the future and tell them we ’ve got to the bottom of this , or second best is to go back to them and say we ’ve turned over every stone and we ca n’t get to an answer sometimes '			1
a number of officers from @entity85 are hoping to be involved in the latest phase of activity , though it is being led by the @entity9			1
mr and mrs @entity41 have been briefed on the activity , but will not travel to @entity9 while the work is being carried out			1
' the activity in @entity9 is led by the @entity9 , that ’s absolutely crystal clear in law , ' mr @entity18 said			1
' we have some officers who would like to be helping with that on the ground in @entity9 , doing some of the work we anticipate			2
we are putting the finishing touches to the plans to the @entity9 in the coming weeks '			0
he added : ' i anticipate a substantial phase of activity in forthcoming weeks including @entity9 and @entity55 officers but the detail of that is still being finalised with @entity9 colleagues and it will all be under @entity9 leadership			0
' briefed : @entity39 and @entity41 , pictured at a prayer service earlier this month - have been told about the police plans , but will not visit the resort during the investigation @entity112 : @entity9 police initially searched the resort , but the @entity11 will look for anything they might have missed one line of inquiry for @entity85 is a lone male paedophile who staged a series of sex attacks on young @entity55 girls while they were on holiday in the @entity122			1
they are looking at nine sexual assaults and three ' near misses ' on @entity55 girls aged six to 12 between 2004 and 2006 , including one in 2005 on a 10 - year - old girl in @entity17 , where @entity37 vanished two years later			2
hundreds of people have already made contact with police in response to appeals to try to find the attacker			0
mr @entity18 warned that , after sifting through all the possible lines of inquiry , officers may draw a blank			0
' there ’s lots of potential lines of inquiry ' , he said			0
' if we did n’t think there were any potentially fruitful lines of inquiry , we would n’t be where we are today ; we would be saying there ’s nowhere to go with this investigation			0
' there are many potential fruitful lines of inquiry and the only way you get anywhere is to work through them all systematically			0
' within that may be the answer and the case may be potentially solvable			0
we may be able to work through potential lines of inquiry over a period of time with the @entity9 and all of them draw a blank , that can happen ' .			2

police have said that new work will begin soon in @entity161 , @entity9
@entity37 disappeared from the resort aged 3 on 3 may 2007
