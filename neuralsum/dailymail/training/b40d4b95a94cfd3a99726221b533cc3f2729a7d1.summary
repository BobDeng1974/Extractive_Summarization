commons leader @entity0 tonight fired a warning at @entity2 that banning @entity4 mps from voting on @entity6 laws ‘ can not now be avoided ’			1
the former foreign secretary , emerging from a summit with @entity9 mps at the prime minister ’s countryside retreat at @entity12 , said ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’ was ‘ something we have to face up to ’ in the wake of the scottish independence referendum			1
he said handing more devolved powers to @entity20 had to go hand in hand with less @entity4 influence over @entity6 laws			1
@entity0 , the @entity23 , said @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ' could not be avoided ' but mr @entity0 held out an olive branch to the @entity2 – insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks			1
he said : ‘ we will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the @entity2 and other parties as well			0
’ however he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the @entity33 parties - including the @entity34 - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in may			2
he said : ‘ this issue of fairness for @entity6 - as well as for @entity4 , @entity40 and @entity41 - i think is one that can not now be avoided			1
that is now something we have to face up to			0
‘ it has been discussed for a very long time			0
the time has now come to make some decisions about this			0
’ it came after the @entity51 mayor @entity50 said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to @entity54 were being introduced at a ‘ blisteringly fast ’ pace - despite claims by @entity4 nationalists that @entity33 was ' reneging ' on its campaign promises			1
but he warned that the ‘ basic unfairness ’ of allowing @entity4 mps to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing			1
he said this ‘ can be done while keeping the @entity65 together ’ , but added : ‘ it is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight			0
’ mr @entity50 ’s remarks come amid growing pressure on @entity2 to back the prime minister ’s proposal - announced just hours after last week ; s referendum result was confirmed - to ban @entity4 mps from voting on laws which only apply in @entity6			1
mr @entity72 said the ' @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ' measure should be introduced ‘ in tandem ’ with handing new powers to @entity20			1
the pm is holding talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat , @entity12 , today to win support for his proposal			2
but shadow chancellor @entity83 this morning refused six times to say whether it was ‘ fair ’ for @entity4 mps to vote on laws which did not apply in @entity4 – and slammed mr @entity72 for using the referendum in @entity4 to score political points			1
it came after the @entity2 leader @entity90 evaded the question thirteen times			2
@entity51 mayor @entity50 this morning called for @entity72 to be given time to introduce @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws mr @entity83 said he wanted a ‘ fairer ’ solution to the problem , but said : ‘ i think @entity72 is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he ’s got some easy , quick political fix which him and @entity0 and @entity101 sorted out			1
‘ you ca n’t play political games with our constitution			0
i want fairness , but i ’m not going to say there ’s an easy and fair solution to the question you ’re raising			0
’ he continued that the prime minister was ‘ playing fast and loose with the whole of our @entity65 ’			0
‘ i ’m not going to say to you i ’m going to sign up to a change in a couple of months because @entity72 is in a hole			2
‘ i do think is possibly the most un-prime ministerial thing i ’ve seen @entity72 do in the last few years			2
’ @entity118 leader @entity117 has jumped on the wrangling over @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws to accuse @entity33 of ‘ reneging ’ on its pledge to devolve more powers to @entity4			1
but mr @entity50 this morning said it was ‘ tosh ’ that @entity72 was going back on his ‘ vow ’			1
the @entity51 mayor said : ‘ it is simply not true that the undertakings have been breached ; on the contrary , all political parties are going to huge lengths to be obliging			0
‘ the “ vow ” that appears on the front of last week ’s @entity139 is actually quite vague			0
it boils down to “ extensive ” new powers for the @entity4 parliament and government , and an agreement to get to work on the agenda as soon as possible			2
‘ @entity72 is putting @entity0 in charge , and we are promised details by @entity142 night in january			2
‘ that strikes me as blisteringly fast , when you consider the gravity of the matters at stake			0
’ but he said : ‘ if we give any more powers to @entity4 politicians , then we simply must address the basic unfairness to @entity6 ; indeed , it should have been addressed years ago , as soon as devolution kicked in			1
’ he added : ‘ it wo n’t necessarily be easy , but it is n’t beyond the wit of man			0
it can be done , while keeping the @entity65 together and giving @entity4 the “ extensive ” new powers that have been agreed			0
it is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight			0

*prominent* @entity9 backbench @entity162 held talks with @entity72 today
pm eager to keep mps on side amid anger over devolution offer to @entity4
@entity0 said ' @entity6 votes for @entity6 ' laws had to be introduced
comes after @entity50 said the issue was a matter of ' basic unfairness '
but @entity178 said @entity6 votes on @entity6 laws ca *n't* be introduced ' overnight '
comes as @entity83 refuses to say six times whether *current* set up is fair
@entity90 has rejected calls for ' @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws '
