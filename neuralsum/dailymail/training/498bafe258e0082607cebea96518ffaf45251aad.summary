@entity0 was among the first major techs firm to jump on the smartwatch bandwagon , but its square designs have regularly been criticised for being too clunky			0
it ’s no surprise then that @entity0 has filed numerous patents for wrist - worn gadgets with circular faces			1
the latest , filed in march last year and awarded this week , details what @entity0 calls its ' new design ' and reveals a round watch with a sensor in the band			1
the patent was filed by the @entity15 tech giant in march last year and awarded this week			1
it reveals what the firm calls its ' new design ’ and shows a circular face			1
in the files , a selection of images reveal the front , rear , left and right - side ( pictured ) views in the files , titled ‘ the ornamental design for an electronic device , as shown and described ’ images reveal the top front , front , rear , left , and right - side views			1
in may , a patent detailed a @entity0 smartwatch that did n't need a phone to work			0
later the same month , images in another patent revealed this rumoured device may not even need a touchscreen			2
according to the application , the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures , detected by sensors built into the wrist - worn device			0
these sensors could recognise flicks , waves and other movements , and the files claim a depth sensor , when combined with a camera , for example , could be used to detect what a user is pointing at			2
it resembles the rounded design of the @entity58 , expected ‘ later this summer ’ - but was filed before the @entity58 was officially unveiled			1
the patent was also filed before @entity0 released its square @entity60 and gear range of watches , so it is unclear if a round watch is in the making , or was only proposed			2
in a number of the images in the latest patent , a sensor can be seen fitted to the wristband			1
this could be a camera , similar to the one built into the top panel on the @entity74 , or a heart rate sensor , as seen on the rear of the @entity78 phone			1

for example , it ’s likely any rounded watch will run either @entity96 or @entity97			2
@entity0 's @entity74 , for example , runs on the former , while the @entity99 is powered by the latter			0

meanwhile , the @entity99 is powered by @entity97			0
