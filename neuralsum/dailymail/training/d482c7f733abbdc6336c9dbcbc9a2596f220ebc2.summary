there was disappointment for motorists today as fuel duty was frozen rather than reduced , but good news for owners of @entity6 , which are now classed as classic cars exempt from road tax			1
chancellor @entity9 announced that the planned september fuel duty rise will not take place , but he resisted calls to cut duty - to the disappointment of campaign and motoring groups			1
the @entity16 said the freeze on duty , for a fourth year , was ' very welcome relief for @entity21 drivers '			1
' now that we know , from official figures , that inflation - hit earnings are effectively at 2002 levels and car use is struggling to revive , perhaps a short - term cut in fuel duty would have got the @entity21 properly mobile again			1
' professor @entity43 , director of the @entity44 , said : ' the good news is that fuel duty has now been frozen since march 2011			2

under earlier rules only cars built before january 1 1973 were exempt from vehicle excise duty			0
but mr @entity9 said a new 40 - year rule would be introduced from april 1 2014 , meaning newer models will now be exempt			2

professor @entity43 welcomed the extra money			0
but he added : ' the drip , drip of funding does not address the £ 10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified			0

this creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits			0
' the chancellor also said that the two per cent increase in company car tax would be extended to 2017 and 2018 , but there would be an increase in discounts for ultra-low emission vehicles and there will be a reduction in the rate of fuel duty for ethanol .			1
