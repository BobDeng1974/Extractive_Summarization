by @entity1 reporter published : 12:28 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 20 september 2013 a @entity3 contestant who lost out on the chance to win a $ 1 million prize after mis - pronouncing his answer has been given a second chance by @entity8			1
mr @entity10 's misfortune on the popular game show hosted by @entity12 attracted a lot of sympathy , after nerves got the better of him , causing him to stumble through his answer			1
but after @entity16 saw his attempt he invited the contestant to come to @entity19 and appear on @entity20 with @entity8 to prove to the world he did know how to say ' corner curio cabinet '			0
mr @entity10 told @entity16 : ' it was part nerves - @entity12 was right there and he 's a legend - and i had no idea what a curio cabinet was			2
never seen the word , never said the word			0
' after a drum roll , @entity16 then let mr @entity10 redeem himself , by showing that he does know how to say ' corner curio cabinet '			2
and , while it may not have been a $ 1 million prize , @entity16 also presented him with his very own curio cabinet , filled with goodies from the show			1
@entity3 rules state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle			0
winner : he may have missed out on his $ 1 million chance but @entity10 was presented with his own corner curio cabinet by @entity16 although he had landed on the $ 1 million wedge , mr @entity10 would not have necessarily won the prize			1
contestants who land on the wedge hang on to it for the rest of the game and , if they have the highest score and have not landed on the bankruptcy wedges , they are given the chance to play for the big prize			1
only two contestants in the game show 's history have ever taken home the big prize			1
the first was @entity79 in 2008 and the second was @entity81 , who won more than $ 1 million in cash and prizes in may of this year			1
@entity84 : the tuxedoed contestant named @entity10 was thrilled when he won the chance at $ 1 million on @entity3 during their season premier in @entity88 lucky : @entity10 got very lucky when his spin landed on the one million spot , which could have won him a lot of money			1
but his luck was about to change things had been looking good for mr @entity10 when he spun the famous wheel on the long - running game show ’s season premier ’s			1
it landed on the coveted @entity100 prize , in between treacherous @entity102 spots			0
mr @entity10 asked for a c , and there were three			2
he triumphantly held his million dollar panel , which would have turned into a real million dollars had he continued on his winning track			0
but his unfortunate misstep came when he solved the puzzle			0
still happy : @entity10 triumphantly held up his game piece			2
had he kept on that track , he could have eventually won the million bucks ' @entity112 ' : with only one missing letter , @entity10 's win seemed like a lock , but he mispronounced ' curio ' and lost big time the words ‘ corner @entity119 ’ tried to come out , but curio just did n’t sound quite right			1
after a long , hushed pause , the judges hit the wrong answer buzzer and mr @entity10 ’s neighbor went on to pronounce the words correctly			2
mr @entity10 first looked shocked			2
‘ it did n't come out the way you intended it to , we 'll take a look at it during the commercial to make sure we treated you fairly , ’ said host @entity12			0
after that , he just looked sad			0
he should not feel lonely , however			0
last year , a contestant made headlines after losing $ 4,000 for pronouncing ‘ swimming ’ with ‘ g ’ at the end			0
sad face : after judges deemed his bumbled word an incorrect answer , @entity10 went from jubilant to depressed			0

@entity10 appears on @entity144 to prove he can pronounce game show puzzle
