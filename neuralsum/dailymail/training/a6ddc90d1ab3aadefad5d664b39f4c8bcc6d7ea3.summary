@entity2 's @entity1 dreams were ended on the opening stage in @entity4 as he suffered a serious crash			1
the @entity6 appeared to slip on a drain in wet conditions during the team time trial , taking three of his @entity12 team - mates with him in a dramatic pile - up			1
@entity2 , who had made this race the focus of his season , made little attempt to get back up as he held his collar bone and waited for medical attention			2
crash : the aftermath after @entity2 appeared to slip on a drain in wet conditions during the team time trial it was the most dramatic illustration of the huge role the weather played as the first @entity27 of the season started under damp skies			1
@entity30 took victory , gifting the leader 's pink jersey to birthday boy @entity34 , and although they had been the favourites they could be grateful for being the second team out as they benefited from dry roads			1
the rain soon began to fall , costing general classification hopefuls @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 ) significant chunks of time against @entity46 , whose @entity47 held it together as the roads became more and more slippy , as well as late starters @entity50 and @entity52			2
cruel : @entity2 ( centre ) had set his sights on winning stage one of the 2014 @entity1 the wet weather had not deterred thousands of fans from lining the @entity4 roads , but the mood changed as the big screens showed @entity2 tumbling to the ground			1
@entity12 manager @entity62 reacted to the crash immediately on @entity64			2
professional bike racing is cruel , ' he wrote			0
@entity2 's uncle , 1987 @entity1 winner @entity68 , was also on @entity64 moments after the crash			1
' absolutely gutted @entity71 ' he wrote			0
@entity2 , a stage winner on last year 's @entity73 and cousin of @entity46 , was considered one of the contenders at the start of the race , but the crash left his team 's plans in ruins			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity34 collects the @entity83 after his team won the first stage of the @entity1 they were able to get five riders to the line together - the minimum required in the team time trial - but they finished three and a half minutes down on @entity30 's time of 24 minutes 42 seconds , surely eliminating 2012 winner @entity92 from contention too			1
it was another huge slice of bad luck for @entity2 , who was on course to defend his title at @entity99 at the end of april before crashing on the final bend			2
the roads began to dry late on , allowing @entity50 's @entity104 team to take second place , just five seconds off @entity30 , to leave the former @entity107 rider - second in the @entity1 last year - as the best placed of the gc contenders , with @entity110 's third place putting @entity52 just two seconds further back			1
@entity111 wound up fourth , 23 seconds off the pace , to leave @entity46 content			0
' it was really tough , ' he said of the conditions			0
' looking at the forecast we were hoping it was going to be okay but unfortunately not , but i think we set a good mark			0
' i said if we only gave up 20 - 30 seconds from the lead team we 'd be in good shape			2
' @entity122 led @entity107 home in fifth , while @entity40 's @entity41 could only manage eighth , 55 seconds back , and @entity124 found himself 93 seconds back after a disappointing run from @entity126			0
but nobody could dampen the mood of @entity129 as the @entity130 celebrated his 37th birthday in pink			0
' an amazing day , ' he said			0
' it 's a pretty crazy way to spend your birthday but to finish on that note , what a treat			0
i ca n't thank my team - mates enough for giving me that opportunity			1
it 's a once - in - a - lifetime thing , what a fantastic team			2
' they gave me a great gift , it was really a birthday present			0
this team is really selfless in that way			0
