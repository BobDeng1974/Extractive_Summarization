by @entity0 published : 01:22 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 14 may 2013 sir @entity2 's final title parade saw around 100,000 @entity4 fans turn out to salute their heroes as the team bus took to the streets to celebrate winning the @entity9 title			1
all eyes were on wantaway striker @entity11 , who looked in good spirits as the bus toured the roads to the adulation of fans			1
@entity17 , having sealed @entity2 's final home win with his first goal since 2008 , led the celebrations , leading the fans in chants and tweeting pictures of him and his team - mates in the pub in the early afternoon			1
@entity2 , who called time on his career in management last week after 27 years at the @entity4 helm , said : ' i thought that 99 could not be beaten but you 've beaten it today			1
thank you for the fantastic support			1
i hope we 're here to win this many times again			1
' you always think about it ( whether you are doing the right thing )			2
but i think it is the right time			2
' we have a young squad , with a lot of good young players , who are going to get better			2
' the big test is to win it three times in a row			2
' i hope the boys can do it			2
' short and sweet : sir @entity2 makes a brief speech on stage in @entity50 silverware : @entity4 lift their @entity9 trophy once more in front of a packed @entity50 but there was no word on whether @entity11 will still be around for the start of their title defence			1
@entity2 confirmed on sunday that the @entity59 striker had submitted a transfer request , although added that it had been turned down			1
@entity11 received a mixed reception when he boarded the open - top bus at @entity63 for the start of the parade , although he did play an active part in the celebrations as it made its slow way along the route into the centre of @entity71 , where huge numbers of @entity4 fans turned out to acclaim their team			1
but , speaking to @entity75 , @entity11 did not answer directly a question about what the retiring @entity2 had done for him , and was not asked whether he would be staying or not			1
' he has been brilliant for us all , ' @entity11 said			1
' he is a great manager			2
he is a winner and to do it for so long is incredible			2
' he is a fantastic manager and a fantastic person			2
' we 're here ! the @entity4 bus arrives in @entity50 smoking : the crowds gather in @entity50 as the @entity4 players close in wild : the @entity4 bus makes it 's way through @entity89 , where spectators gathered in their thousands all smiles : sir @entity2 punches the air in celebration having fun : @entity97 waves a scarf as he gets into the party spirit all aboard : united fans greet their heroes as the bus sets off towards the city centre party spirit : @entity106 joins in the scarf waving outside @entity63 leading from the front : captain @entity109 holds on to the @entity9 trophy and waves to the adoring fans sod off : a child holds a sign with a message for @entity11 not enjoying it ? @entity11 looks downbeat on the bus with 20,000 fans packed into sir @entity120 , roads had to be closed prior to the @entity122 ' departure			1
and whilst there was space along the main route into the city centre , once the bus headed down the main shopping area , @entity89 , supporters found a variety of vantage points to see the team drive past			1
@entity17 and @entity133 , who at times ditched the crutches he is supposed to be using to nurse an ankle injury that has ended his season , led the singing , with @entity2 also joining in , and even forced @entity138 onto centre stage for a rare interview			1
there was a moment of humour , as defender @entity144 was asked by @entity75 interviewer @entity145 , who also happens to be his fiancee , whether he was going to have a good summer			2
' yes , ' @entity144 replied			0
' i am getting married , to you @entity145			0
' @entity138 , who also announced his retirement , said : ' it means everything			0
we set out each year to try and win the league and most of the years we do it			0

' @entity158 also admitted the reception topped the one in 1999 : ' thanks for coming out			0

' it is just brilliant			0
it gives us a chance to share with the fans a great achievement this season			0
it is an amazing atmosphere			0
