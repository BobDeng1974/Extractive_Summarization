tens of thousands of public sector jobs in @entity4 are at risk if voters choose independence next week , @entity1 campaigners warned yesterday			1
more than 57,000 @entity4 are employed by @entity9 departments or @entity11 - wide public bodies such as the @entity12			1
splitting from the rest of @entity11 would put many civil service positions in jeopardy as the smaller @entity4 state would not need all of them , no vote supporters say			1
a total of 545,200 @entity4 workers are employed by the state , making up more than 21 per cent of the total labour market			1
by contrast less than 17 per cent of jobs in @entity34 are in the public sector , official figures from the start of this year show			1
a recent report by the @entity42 think - tank noted that some of the largest @entity9 departments are ‘ over-represented ’ in @entity4			1
@entity4 makes up about 8 per cent of the @entity11 ’s population , but has 11 per cent of jobs in the @entity47 and 12 per cent in @entity48			1
some 57,800 @entity4 work for @entity50 ministries or quangos and other public bodies that cover the whole of @entity11			1
@entity9 ’s biggest employer in @entity4 is the @entity55 , which has 3,900 civil servants and 10,600 uniformed personnel north of the border			1
former defence secretary @entity59 warned last year that these jobs and defence contracts worth billions of pounds would be put in peril if @entity4 voters opted for independence			2
the @entity47 employs a further 10,700 @entity4 , while 9,000 work for @entity48			2
another 600 jobs are based at the offices of the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) in @entity69 , representing a third of the ministry ’s total workforce			0
the @entity12 has about 1,200 employees in @entity4 , but it is unclear precisely what would happen to them in the event of independence			0
@entity79 leader @entity78 wants to create a new public service broadcaster called the @entity81 , which would ‘ initially be founded on the staff and assets of @entity84 ’			0
@entity78 has been accused of making pledges he can not afford to fund - such as new public service broadcaster called the @entity81 @entity4 institutions account for the bulk of public sector workers in the country			1
these jobs would not be affected immediately by a vote in favour of independence			0
some 248,000 @entity4 work in local government , including schools , and 158,000 are employed by @entity97			2
the @entity98 and its agencies have 16,900 staff , while 28,700 people work for the @entity4 police or fire services			0
@entity105 mp @entity104 fears that hundreds of @entity68 jobs in his @entity69 constituency would be axed if the @entity109 campaign prevails next week			0
he rejected @entity79 claims that all the posts would be maintained in a newly independent @entity4			1
the @entity111 , which he sits on , has calculated that nearly all of the @entity68 positions for @entity4 would be lost			2
mr @entity104 said : ‘ what we established is that @entity4 would have to set up its own international development agency			0
it would be a fraction of the size of the current operation in @entity69			0
it would mean 500 jobs would go			0
’ he accused mr @entity78 of making pledges he could not afford to fund and suggested that many @entity4 public sector workers would vote to remain in the @entity11			1
‘ in a democracy you are entitled to vote against your own self - interest , but i doubt many people would , ’ he said			0
@entity105 mp for @entity69 @entity104 , pictured centre on the campaign trail with @entity131 , rejected @entity79 claims that all the posts would be maintained in a newly independent @entity4 ‘ the majority of @entity4 are far too canny to be brought into this concept that you can get everything available for free			1
it simply does n’t add up			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity138 campaign added : ‘ the impartial experts at the @entity140 say that a separate @entity4 would need to cut public spending by an extra £ 6 billion			2
that puts jobs in the public sector at risk			1
‘ this is a risk that we just do n't have to take			0
there is a better way for @entity4			0
we are guaranteed more powers for @entity4 , backed up by the strength , security and stability of being part of the larger @entity11			2
‘ it 's the best of both worlds			0
we should say “ no thanks ” to putting that at risk on september 18			0
’ the @entity98 ’s @entity160 on independence , launched last november , states that ‘ many ’ current @entity9 jobs will transfer to the new separate @entity4 in the event of a @entity109 vote			2
it adds : ‘ @entity165 will provide opportunities for employment in @entity4 in government functions where jobs are currently located elsewhere in the @entity11			2
‘ given that the @entity98 will be taking on a range of new responsibilities , there will be new job opportunities in the public sector in @entity4			1
’ the @entity109 campaign declined to comment .			0

more than 57,000 @entity4 are employed by @entity9 departments
splitting from rest of @entity11 would put civil service positions in jeopardy
' no ' supporters have said a smaller state would ' not need all of them '
