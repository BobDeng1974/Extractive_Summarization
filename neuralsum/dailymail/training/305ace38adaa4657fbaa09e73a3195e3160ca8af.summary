between the baking , stacking and frosting herself , one @entity1 mother thought it would be a lot easier to order her two daughters ’ shared birthday cupcakes off @entity8			1
when @entity9 found a cake making and decorating ad through a classified section in @entity13 , in @entity1 , she was convinced that ‘ @entity16 ’ would deliver what they had advertised			1
but when the mother - of - three opened the box after the birthday dinner , her youngest daughter @entity17 , 4 , was left in tears			2
the 28 - year - old told @entity23 that her cupcakes looked nothing like the photos advertised or described on the @entity8 page			1
@entity9 made an order with @entity29 , who promised the same frozen design made by @entity32 ( pictured top ) but when she opened the box , it looked nothing like she wanted ( pictured bottom ) ‘ she had a lot of designs advertised so i told her that i wanted @entity42 ones and she said “ i have no problems with doing that ” and claimed she had previously made @entity42 cakes and even sent me photos to prove it , ’ ms @entity9 said			1
ms @entity9 agreed to pay $ 50 for two sets of cupcakes before they were made and she picked them up at the woman ’s home , who lives just around the corner from her dad			1
‘ all i had to do was place the order through her page , pay for it and i did n’t have to queue in line through a bakery and flick through a lot of magazines to decide what i wanted			0
ms @entity9 said the lady even sent her a picture of her previous @entity42 cupcakes that she made but the ones she got was nothing like the photos but when ms @entity9 opened the boxes at a restaurant after the birthday dinner , she was outraged			1
‘ they looked gross – @entity17 wanted the @entity80 ’s @entity79 movie characters on her cupcakes but she started crying after she saw the face of the snowman , ’ she said			0
‘ it did n’t look like a cuddly snowman			0
it looked more like it came out of a horror movie – it was really scary			0
‘ it was nothing like the pictures she had advertised and i ’m pretty sure they were n’t baked that day because they tasted stale and dry			0
‘ it ’s disappointing because my children were upset and i had to rush out and get new cupcakes , which only cost me $ 5.50 at a supermarket and they tasted delicious			0
’ @entity97 , 20 and his partner @entity98 , 20 , also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business cake fail : another mother was outraged when she ordered this baby dinosaur cake ( left ) but got something completely different ( right ) when ms @entity9 asked for her money back , the woman claimed she had photo evidence of her children eating them			1
‘ i was really confused because i do n’t have pictures of my kids eating them but she said i was n’t entitled for a refund and started ignoring all my messages			0
’ @entity97 , 20 and his partner @entity98 , 20 , also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business			1
‘ @entity98 spoke to the lady through @entity8 and asked if she could make a dinosaur cake for our brother - in - law , @entity121 who is 21 and has a disability , ’ mr @entity97 told @entity23			1
‘ we even sent her a picture of what we wanted and the lady said she could make it			0
’ random act of kindness : the couple was later approached by two strangers on @entity8 , who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging the couple was asked to pay $ 65 upfront but after the cake was ready to be picked up , the woman sent the couple a picture of what the cake looked like			1
‘ it looked disgusting and we did n’t want it			0
‘ but she refused to give us a refund and @entity98 tried talking to her through @entity8 and then she gave us two options – to take the cake or get a refund of $ 25			1
‘ @entity98 posted the picture on the woman ’s page so everyone could see what she was trying to do			2
another prime example of some global cake fails that has surfaced on social media			0
one baker attempted to make a @entity157 cake but found it was harder than it looked ‘ all these other people started commenting and saying ‘ that ’s not right ’ and eventually she showed up on @entity98 ’s mother ’s front door and refunded all our money			2
‘ she was really rude to us and we had to go through a lot of trouble to get it back			0
‘ if you ’re going to promise people , make sure you know how to make a cake properly			0
’ not everyone can perfect the art of cake making			0
another baker tried to make some @entity177 cupcakes cookie monster : ' me want cookie ! me eat cookie ! om nom nom nom ' cake fail : is this meant to be a melting yellow snowman with a raw carrot nose cake ? the couple was later approached by two strangers on @entity8 , who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging			1
‘ it was a random act of kindness - these people went out of their way to make us two different dinosaur cakes after they had seen how disgusting the other cake looked			2
@entity16 has since been removed from @entity8 and @entity23 could not contact for any comments			2
this person tried to make a @entity200 character but it did n't turn out the way it was meant to look @entity204 gone wrong : one baker attempted to make a rubix cube but failed to get the cubes the right size another baker who had the baking skills but failed brilliantly when they made this @entity213 cake happy birthday ? @entity216 movie @entity215 has eyes sliding from its ' face when this baker tried to make a cake but failed one baker thought it would be a good idea to include @entity223 on a @entity224 on a cake for their daughter 's 6th birthday another baker takes it to a whole new level with a novelty @entity233 doll stuck through the cake mrs @entity235 : another baker frosting up a birthday cake for a @entity239 fan @entity240 : @entity241 got to spend her 9th birthday celebrating with a homemade @entity244 cake another baker 's greatest cake fail of a @entity248 cake			2
