by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:45 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 23 november 2012 four ministers sacked in september 's reshuffle were given knighthoods by @entity4 @entity4 has been criticised by a powerful @entity5 for giving knighthoods to ministers given the boot in this year ’s reshuffle			1
the prime minister is accused of ‘ politicising ’ the honours system by mps who say they were left ‘ perplexed and disillusioned ’ by his decision to give gongs to middle - ranking ministers told to return to the backbenches			1
after september ’s reshuffle @entity18 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were all recommended by for knighthoods by mr @entity4			1
sir @entity24 was made a companion of honour after being sacked as @entity26 , but within weeks returned to government as chief whip			1
the awards sparked outrage because more senior women – including cabinet ministers @entity32 and @entity34 – were dumped from government without being offered an honour			0
it follows a major row in august when it emerged that a secret quota system meant three times as many civil servants could receive honours than medal winners at the @entity44			0
ministers have now agreed to release full explanations for of why honours are given to remove any suggestion of politicial interfeefence or corruption			0
the public citations will be trialled in the @entity52			0
but today the @entity53 criticised giving knighthoods to former ministers and accused mr @entity4 of going against earlier assurances that honours would not be made for political reasons			2
@entity60 chairman @entity59 took the unusual step of releasing a letter he sent to mr @entity4 warning the knighthoods for ex-ministers appeared ‘ inconsistent ’ with evidence given to the committee by the head of the @entity68 , sir @entity69 , during its inquiry into the honours system			1
going , going , gong : knighthoods were given to @entity20 , former solicitor general , and @entity18 , former farming minister @entity74 @entity21 and @entity76 @entity75 were both knighted after leaving the @entity77 mr @entity59 , a senior @entity76 mp , wrote : ‘ if it is the policy of the government that the prime minister should retain the right to award honours at his personal behest , why was this not apparent from the government 's submissions to our inquiry ? ‘ the honours you have announced may well reward “ exceptional service ” , but there is a danger that they will appear to the public to be political ' consolation prizes ' for the ministers concerned			1
’ sir @entity24 left the government in the reshuffle and was awarded the @entity100 - but within weeks he was back as chief whip the committee ’s report , published today , said the pm had to explain himself if he intended to take political control of the honours system			1
‘ without questioning the public service of those selected , by the prime minister , to receive honours at the end of their ministerial career , we are concerned that awarding honours in such a manner will further reduce public confidence in the honours system			2
‘ again , if the government supports such political control of the award of honours in certain circumstances , it should be prepared to justify that			0
’ the committee warned that the credibility of the @entity60 was also in danger of being undermined by the decision to include the chief whips of the three main political parties			0
it said that their presence left it open to the charge of ‘ political manipulation in the interest of party leaders ’			0
mr @entity59 added : ‘ if honours are to retain any meaning and value they must be awarded to genuinely deserving recipients who have contributed to their communities above and beyond the norm , through a transparent system where people can see the value of the honour and what it was awarded for			0
’ in his reply mr @entity4 insisted that he had only made a ‘ very limited number ’ of awards , adding : ‘ i am determined that these special cases will not affect the integrity of the wider honours system			2
