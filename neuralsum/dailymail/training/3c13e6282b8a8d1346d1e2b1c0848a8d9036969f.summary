by @entity0 @entity1 did n't have the best game in sunday 's @entity3 , but at least he could console himself with the support he had in the stands			2
that was n't from the @entity8 contingent who booed the former @entity11 playmaker throughout , but his partner @entity12			1
the glamorous model posted a snap on @entity16 of herself at @entity18 watching the game along with the message ' @entity18 ! # @entity20 '			2
the 27 - year - old would have been frustrated with his display against the @entity35 winners , as he was replaced just after the break by @entity38 @entity37			0
one consolation @entity20 will take is that the last time they lost out in the @entity3 final they went on to win the league			0
@entity43 on the other hand is very optimistic of his side 's chances of silverware this season with a plethora of attacking options at his disposal			0
@entity8 keen to push on after @entity3 victory lacklustre : @entity1 was replaced by @entity37 after just 46 minutes following an uncharacteristic poor showing			1

@entity1 was watched on at @entity18 by his partner @entity12
he was booed throughout by fans of former side @entity8
the @entity60 was disappointing during the 3 - 0 *defeat* against the @entity11
