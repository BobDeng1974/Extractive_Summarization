by @entity1 reporter @entity3 boss @entity2 is in no doubt that their @entity6 clash with @entity7 would be a great one to win			1
however @entity2 has also emphasised it should not necessarily be seen as an indicator of how the clubs ' title bids might pan out			2
the contest at the @entity14 pits the champions - in @entity16 - and runners - up from last term against each other			0
realistic target : @entity2 believes his side can get something out of monday night 's game at @entity7 celebration : @entity3 managed to beat @entity6 rivals @entity7 3 - 2 at @entity25 last season for each team it is only their second @entity6 fixture of the 2014/15 campaign , and @entity2 feels the fact it comes so early makes it particularly significant in terms of needing to make a mark			1
at the same time , though , he is not going to be reading too deeply into the outcome			0
' whatever time this game comes , it 's always very important - and for us , so early on , it 's even more significant , ' @entity2 said			2
' but i do n't think it will define everything			0
it 's over the course of the 38 games			0
' we did reasonably well in the big games last season , but it 's over the course of the 38 , and that 's something i 'll always look at			0
' it 's early in the season and we started with a great win , and now to go and perform and hopefully get the result is what the aim will be			0
' both @entity3 and @entity7 began their @entity6 campaigns with victories , triumphing 2 - 1 against @entity58 and 2 - 0 at @entity59 respectively			1
victory : @entity3 claimed a 2 - 1 win against @entity58 on the opening weekend of the @entity6 certainly neither found their best form as they each picked up the three points , and @entity7 boss @entity64 said : ' we played very well in the first 35 , 45 minutes in all senses			1
' technically and physically we did n't have any problems			0
' but maybe in the second half we could not continue with the same pace			0
' @entity64 also closely monitored @entity3 's performance against @entity58 from the opening weekend			2
he said : ' i watched that game and we played them also in the @entity74 ( this summer in a pre-season friendly ) , so we know what they are doing			0
' @entity16 signing @entity78 remains unlikely to make his debut as he is still short of match fitness , but fellow defender @entity82 could be back in line to start and loan midfielder @entity84 is available			1
city debut : @entity84 could make his first appearance for the club since joining the club on loan striker @entity90 , who came off the bench to score at @entity59 last week , may not be ready to play 90 minutes			1
former @entity7 striker @entity92 will not be able to feature even if his proposed transfer to @entity3 from @entity94 goes through before the match , as it needed to have been completed by midday on friday for the @entity96 to be eligible			1
@entity92 's proposed switch to the @entity99 outfit appears to be imminent , with a Â£ 16million fee reportedly agreed and the @entity101 international having visited the club 's @entity104 training ground on friday			2
there could be debuts for @entity110 summer signings @entity108 and @entity111 , but the wait for @entity114 midfielder @entity113 ( knee ) to make his bow will go on .			1

@entity2 hopes his side can build on their win against @entity58
@entity84 could make his @entity7 debut against @entity3
@entity3 are on the verge of signing former @entity7 striker @entity92
midfielder @entity113 remains *sidelined* with a knee *injury*
