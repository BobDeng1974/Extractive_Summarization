brave : the @entity1 still managed to smile despite being forced to visit @entity3 @entity2 without her beloved husband @entity4 , who is in hospital nearby the @entity1 robustly insisted the @entity4 was ‘ not ill ’ yesterday			1
her comments , during a tour of the @entity3 ’s new @entity2 , came as her husband underwent exploratory surgery on his abdomen			1
last night he was said to be making ‘ satisfactory progress ’ following the operation under general anaesthetic			2
during a visit to the @entity3 ’s new hq , the @entity1 was asked by radio and tv host @entity17 how prince @entity4 was faring , she replied : ‘ i have no idea , i mean he has only just gone in			1
’ when the @entity22 presenter persisted , saying the @entity4 had looked well during his appearance at a @entity25 garden party on thursday just hours before his admission , the monarch remarked pithily : ‘ that ’s because he ’s not ill. ’ @entity25 confirmed in a statement last night that the surgery had been successfully completed and the results would now be analysed			1
they appeared cautiously optimistic about his recovery , saying that ‘ at this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily ’			1
such caution is understandable given @entity4 ’s age and the fact that this is the fourth time he has been hospitalised in the last 18 months			1
minutes before the @entity25 statement was released , however , the @entity1 ’s physician , professor @entity48 , was seen leaving the hospital apparently in good spirits			1
the statement read : ‘ his royal highness the @entity4 has had an exploratory operation following abdominal investigations			1
the results will now be analysed			0
at this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily			1
further updates will continue to be issued when appropriate			0
’ newsflash : presenters @entity58 and @entity59 turn round to find the @entity1 has turned up during one their bulletins caught unawares : the newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background speech : speaking on @entity22 and the @entity67 she said how she had been to the original @entity2 with her parents before the war and then later before her @entity70 , with prince @entity4 speech : speaking on @entity22 and the @entity67 she said how she had been to the original @entity2 with her parents before the war and then later before her @entity70 , with prince @entity4 pensive : the queen on a visit to the @entity3 yesterday , as prince @entity4 underwent abdominal surgery the @entity1 will spend the weekend at @entity77 as usual			1
she is said to be ‘ concerned ’ and being kept fully informed of her husband ’s progress			0
@entity80 , the @entity4 ’s eldest grandson , said the family were being informed about his grandfather ’s progress , and he would not want them to stop going about their daily business			2
he told @entity87 : ‘ obviously our thoughts and prayers are with him , we know that he ’s in good hands and we ’ve been kept up to date in terms of what ’s happening			2
' but he ’s one of those people who would n’t want you to stop just because he ’s gone into hospital			0
’ @entity4 , who turns 92 on monday , is set to remain at @entity99 in @entity100 for up to two weeks following the surgery			2
details about his condition or the original symptoms that prompted doctors to recommend the exploratory operation have not been released by @entity25			1
but sources have confirmed that he underwent tests last week and was advised that further medical intervention would be necessary			0
aides have insisted he is in ‘ good spirits ’ and had walked into the hospital unaided after being driven there by car			0
chat : she spoke to lead singer @entity117 of @entity118 , and they briefly discussed @entity120 , with her majesty saying he should be careful of the mud stars : @entity123 presenter @entity124 was joined by @entity126 actress @entity125 also came to @entity127 in @entity128 to see @entity1 meet and greet : sir @entity130 and his wife , former @entity133 @entity132 , as well as veteran broadcaster @entity129 also met the @entity1 today @entity134 to meet you : the @entity1 says hello to sir @entity130 with @entity136 , @entity124 and @entity137 at work : presenters @entity137 and @entity140 were at @entity2 while @entity137 then bumped into presenter @entity141 shortly afterwards performance : @entity117 and his band @entity118 sang the @entity145 song heroes for @entity1 they also suggested that the @entity4 was not suffering from any discomfort and had arranged to have the operation after doctors ‘ picked something up ’ during a routine health check over the past week			1
but mr @entity152 , vice president of the @entity153 and @entity154 , said last night it was ‘ uncommon ’ for someone of the @entity4 ’s age to have an exploratory surgical procedure			1
regardless of how fit the @entity4 might appear to be , surgery at his age carried much greater risks , he said			2
‘ the reason for that is regardless of how fit and well someone might appear to be , when you get to that age there ’s a much increased risk of having other medical problems , ’ he said			0
‘ as you get older you are more likely to have other things wrong which could complicate things during surgery			0
mr @entity152 also suggested a two - week stay in hospital ‘ is longer than would be expected ’ if the procedure was simply routine			0
he added : ‘ if it ’s something very trivial he might be out of commission for three or four weeks or if it ’s more serious , you could be talking about a recovery period of two or three months			0
’ prince @entity4 has cancelled two engagements over the past week – a lecture at @entity77 and a reception at @entity25 – but aides said this was not due to his abdominal pain			1
royal arrival : crowds turned out to greet her majesty as she arrived at @entity2 , five minutes away from where prince @entity4 is in hospital pleased to see her : flag - waving crowds turned out to wish her majesty well as she came to visit the @entity3 's £ 1bn home goodbye : her majesty smiles and waves to the crowds outside @entity2 as she heads back to the @entity25 together : @entity1 and prince @entity4 arrive to attend a garden party yesterday at the @entity25 guards : police stand outside @entity99 this morning , where prince @entity4 has been brought for an operation with a two week stay , it 's likely the @entity4 will undergo a series of tests			1
@entity210 dr @entity209 told @entity211 last night that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis			1
this provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound			0
a laparoscopy is not used to diagnose @entity226 procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction , most commonly a twisted bowel , where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped			0
the @entity4 's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications			1
he was taken into hospital in @entity240 in august after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in june			0
the @entity4 spent almost a week in the @entity244 in @entity128 after falling ill with the infection during the @entity246			2
it was the third time in nine months the @entity4 has been in hospital			2
in 2011 , he spent @entity250 at @entity251 in @entity252 after suffering chest pains at the @entity254 in @entity255			0
he underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery , for which he had a stent fitted			0
general aesthetics can cause serious side - effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients			0
at worst they include cardiac arrest , breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea , headaches and temporary confusion			0
a royal source told the @entity273 : ‘ the @entity4 underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation			1
‘ he has been feeling under the weather in recent days but that is because he had lost his voice			0
the two are quite unconnected			0
‘ he was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today ’s garden party , where he was on top form			2
’ the situation prompts further questions about the @entity4 ’s workload and that of the @entity1			1
a few weeks ago , @entity25 announced the pair would be scaling back on their long - haul foreign travel , leaving it largely to younger royals			0
the @entity273 also revealed that high - level talks had been taking place between @entity25 , @entity295 and @entity296 for @entity297 to take an even more prominent role			0
it will also put pressure on the @entity4 and @entity300 – who are expecting their first baby – to become full - time working royals			2
prince @entity305 is due to leave his role as an @entity308 search and rescue pilot in september and is expected within weeks to announce what he intends to do next			0
he had been expected to take up a further military post that would give him more opportunity to undertake royal engagements			0
however pressure is now sure to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off his elderly grandparents			0
the @entity4 ’s admittance to the clinic comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations			2
at yesterday ’s garden party , the @entity1 and prince @entity4 appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm , when the national anthem was played			1
despite the fierce sun , with temperatures of around @entity328 ( @entity329 ) , the @entity4 appeared relaxed and happily chatted to guests as he walked around the garden			2
lord lieutenant of @entity336 sir @entity335 was introduced to the @entity1 and the duke as they made their way through the gardens			1
he said : ‘ it was wonderful to see the @entity4 with her			2
’ sir @entity17 said the prince had been ‘ telling jokes ’ – but would not divulge what they were about			1
all smiles : the @entity1 presents the @entity4 with @entity348 's highest honour , the order of @entity348 , in the presence of sir @entity350 , high commissioner for @entity348 , at @entity25 yesterday earlier this week : @entity1 and the @entity4 attended a service at @entity352 in central @entity128 on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity1 's coronation			1

her majesty met stars including sir @entity130 and @entity129
@entity17 asked after prince @entity4 's health when they shook hands
' i have no idea , he has only just gone in ' , she replied
@entity4 had exploratory operation today and is ' progressing satisfactorily '
she *listened* to performance from @entity118 during @entity372 *gig*
the @entity1 gave a live broadcast from the centre but did not mention @entity4
but she admitted to @entity3 staff that she was a *fan* of @entity378
