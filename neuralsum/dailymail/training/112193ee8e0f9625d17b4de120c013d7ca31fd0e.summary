@entity12 's government - owned @entity131 said 75 @entity12 fishing boats , escorted by coast guard ships , entered waters surrounding the islands to assert @entity12 's sovereignty over the disputed territory			2
@entity139 fought : @entity15 , @entity9 and @entity12 all claim the islands , but they are administered by @entity41 , since the @entity9 government bought them from private owners two weeks ago relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply after @entity9 bought the islands , which are called @entity39 in @entity9 and @entity39 in @entity15 the arrival of @entity12 vessels in the area could complicate the potentially fraught game of cat - and - mouse being played near the islands , where mainland @entity15 has launched an effort to assert sovereignty by sending government ships into the disputed waters			1

@entity12 defence minister @entity217 told parliament that the military was ready for any contingency , but did not elaborate			0
@entity12 has traditionally had friendly ties with @entity9 , but the two countries have long squabbled over fishing rights in the area			2
