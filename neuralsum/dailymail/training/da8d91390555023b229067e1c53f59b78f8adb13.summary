@entity1 president @entity0 believes the feud between @entity3 and @entity4 is good for the sport			1
double @entity7 champion @entity6 and @entity8 team - mate @entity4 were involved in an unseemly spat ahead of the @entity10 in @entity11 last weekend			1
@entity12 - born @entity6 claimed that @entity4 had questioned his nationality after winning 10,000 metres gold at the @entity15 in @entity16 last summer but the silver medallist from @entity18 described that as ' complete lies '			1
the record breaking 31 - year - old athlete salutes the @entity11 crowd after crossing the finish line @entity6 responded to the row by roaring to the first world record of his career - setting a new world indoor best of eight minutes 03.40 seconds over two miles in @entity11 - and @entity0 said the bad blood reminded him of the historic track rivalry between @entity31 and @entity32 and would raise the profile of athletics			1
' what happened was out of character for both of them but it 's not a bad idea to have gossip and talking points in athletics , ' @entity0 said			2
' it happens all the time in football			0
people talk about personalities and suddenly we 've got two top - class athletes who are having a go at each other			0
' i remember the @entity54 era well and you could n't have had two characters with more different personalities			0
' they did n't speak to each other and , of course , that creates a lot of public interest because there 's a human story			0
' @entity3 and @entity4 are both great guys but sometimes in athletics you get this keen rivalry			2
' @entity4 said he would welcome a press conference for the two athletes to clear the air with both men expected to be representing @entity8 at the 2015 @entity74 in @entity75 in august			0
the double @entity7 champion slots in behind the pace maker on his way to setting his first world record @entity6 poses behind the clock in @entity11 showing his world indoor record of eight minutes , 40 seconds and @entity0 supported that novel idea , saying ; ' we 're overshadowed by so many other sports now that we need to put our heads above the horizon and say ' @entity1 is alive and kicking and we 've got personalities here			1
' ' you had that with @entity31 and @entity32 and then the possibility of the two of them racing against each other			0
' it adds spice and rivalry and we need personalities who are larger than life , not just great athletes but people who can project themselves and connect and engage with the public			0
' @entity0 was speaking at the launch of the 2016 @entity105 in @entity106 and @entity6 was the name on most people 's lips at the event			1
the conversation quickly escalated as the two middle - distance runners aired their views on @entity114 @entity6 celebrates beating @entity4 ( left ) in the @entity115 at the @entity15 @entity116 and @entity6 hold up the @entity118 flag together after finishing one - two at the @entity15 ( from left ) @entity116 , @entity6 and @entity120 's @entity119 made up the podium in @entity16 last august the @entity15 will be held on march 26 , 2016 and race organisers are hoping @entity6 will compete in @entity124 , even though it comes less than five months before the @entity7 in @entity125 when the 31 - year - old will be defending his 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres titles			1
' @entity3 's presence would be a massive boost and the icing on the cake because he is such a charismatic figure , ' said @entity0 , the 1964 @entity7 long jump champion			1
' it 's hard to say how it fits in with his @entity7 preparations but i think the half marathon might appeal to him next year rather than the full marathon which he attempted last year in @entity141			2
' it would give him enough time to recover for @entity125 and when i get the chance to chat to him in @entity75 this summer i will ask him to come along [ to @entity106 ]			0
' @entity0 also believes race organisers should entice @entity6 to compete by offering him appearance money as well as a lucrative incentive to break the world record , which is currently held by @entity151 's @entity150 in a time of 58 minutes and 23 seconds			1
' @entity3 is such an iconic figure i would imagine there might be an attractive proposition in terms of appearance and prize money , ' @entity0 said			2
' the course is very flat and potentially world - class times can be recorded on it , which will attract the best runners in the world to claim bonus money for records			0
' we have been granted a special opportunity to put @entity106 and @entity124 on the sporting map and for a @entity170 like myself it will be a very special occasion			0

@entity0 sees no *problem* with @entity3 and @entity4 's spat
@entity6 said he has ' learned a lot ' from the @entity114 spat with @entity116
@entity6 called fellow long distance runner @entity4 ' an *embarrassment* '
@entity4 *criticised* @entity6 's lack of high - level competition in @entity11 ahead of his attempt to break the world indoor record over two miles
double @entity7 champion spoke after breaking the world two mile record
he launched the @entity191 in @entity192 on *sunday*
