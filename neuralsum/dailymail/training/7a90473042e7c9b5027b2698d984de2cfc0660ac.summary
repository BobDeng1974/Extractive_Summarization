hospitalized : police say 26 - year - old @entity6 , pictured from a 2011 arrest , allegedly shot himself during a game of @entity4 changing stories : witnesses first told police that @entity16 , pictured , was the victim of a home invasion but later admitted to playing the deadly game @entity4 two other men taking part in the game , had fired the gun and survived			1
