by @entity0 for @entity1 a family are today celebrating the arrival of a baby boy , just months after losing another son to a rare heart condition			1
@entity7 was born just over two weeks ago			1
but his arrival comes months after his parents @entity9 and @entity11 suffered a devastating loss when their 14 - month - old son @entity14 lost his battle for life			1
the toddler became the face of a national organ donor appeal after he was born with the arteries to his heart wired the wrong way around			1
@entity9 and @entity23 from @entity24 , welcomed baby @entity7 two weeks ago			1
four months earlier they lost their 14 - month - old son @entity14 after he was born with the main arteries in his heart wired the wrong way around 14 - month - old @entity27 ( pictured right and left ) passed away in april after he was born with the arteries to his heart wired the wrong way around mrs @entity28 did not find out until three weeks before @entity14 's sudden death that she was pregnant with @entity7 , by which time she was already 17 weeks pregnant			1
' we looked back trying to find any signs , any symptoms , but there was nothing , ' the 29 - year - old from @entity31 , said			2
' i was n't sick like i 'd been with the other children - it was like the baby had been hidden from us			0
' we did n't know how we would cope			0
we were the only two people who could look after @entity14 and our first thought was how would we look after him			2
' they struggled to come to terms with the fact there would be a new addition to the family with siblings @entity51 , 12 , @entity52 , 10 , @entity53 , eight , @entity54 , five and @entity55 , four			0
and with the gruelling demands of caring for @entity14 and their other five children , the couple admit they even briefly considered abortion			2
but they said now , they would n't change it for the world			0
' @entity7 is our gift from @entity14 , ' said his father , @entity11 , 34			1
' it 's like @entity14 's been looking after us all			2
' having @entity7 has helped us with the healing process			2
' he said the first few days after @entity7 's arrival were tough as they were constantly reminded of @entity14 , who was born at @entity24 's @entity73 with the main arteries to his heart the wrong way around , starving his body of oxygen			1
he underwent two emergency seven - hour operations within 24 hours at @entity81 and was placed on the organ transplant list and rushed to @entity84 's @entity83			2
@entity14 had spent most his life in hospital , but seemed to have turned a corner when he was welcomed home for the first time to live with his five brothers and sisters before @entity93 before his health sadly deteriorated again			0
@entity7 has become one of the youngest organ donors registered on the national database , following in the footsteps of his siblings , @entity51 , 12 , @entity52 , 10 , @entity53 , eight , @entity54 , five and @entity55 , four mrs @entity28 , said : ' people might think our new baby must be some consolation but it has n't been easy at all			1
' we found it quite hard as we used @entity14 's clothes and toys but we 've got our heads around it now			0
' we just think that if @entity14 was here we 'd be using all that stuff			0
' she faced a traumatic birth delivering @entity7 at home as planned but encountering complications after her son was born			1
she was rushed to @entity24 's @entity73 for an emergency procedure leaving her husband , a @entity119 driver , to fear the worst			0
now baby @entity7 is among the youngest people on the @entity121 after being signed up when he was just a few days old			1
' it 's so easy to sign up , ' mrs @entity28 said			0
' you just go on the website			0
' all our children are registered			0
we could n't expect to receive without doing this			0
' the family remains passionate about organ donation and continues to raise cash for good causes in @entity14 's name , including @entity133 in @entity24 and the specialist children 's heart unit in @entity84 where @entity14 received much of his treatment			1
