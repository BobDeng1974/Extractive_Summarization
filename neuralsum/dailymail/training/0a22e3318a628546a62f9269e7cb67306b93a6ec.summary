armed police in grey and blue uniforms cluster every few yards along @entity3 , the wide and teeming road leading to the track on which @entity6 has tasted almost equal measures of euphoria and dejection			1
the journey in carries a frisson of fear			2
@entity14 - the giant shanty towns of deprived millions - stand on either side of the street			1
and out of those shacks can run gun - toting criminals to hold up cars that stop when the lights turn red			1
barely a year passes without someone from the @entity23 community being robbed or shot at			2
@entity6 says he has no fears as he battles for the @entity26 ' @entity25 @entity6 goes into sunday 's @entity28 @entity27 with a 24 - point lead over @entity31 team - mate @entity30 @entity32 , home of sunday ’s @entity28 @entity27 , is far less dangerous than outside , but the old crumpled place still possesses the most intimidating atmosphere in world motor racing			1
the four stands along the pit straight turn into cacophonous pits of hate , of hissing and whistling , jeering and cheering , as the cars line up to race			1
the crowd ’s enmity poured down on him when he was in a title fight with a @entity49 , @entity50 , in 2008			2
that year he triumphed unforgettably by passing the @entity52 car of @entity53 to finish fifth on the final , rainy lap. he had atoned for his late - season collapse 12 months earlier			1
so here we are again with @entity6 on the cusp of world championship glory			1
he leads @entity30 , his fellow @entity31 man , by 24 points with only @entity61 awaiting him after sunday ’s race			1
but this time he is visibly relaxed and scared of nobody			2
@entity6 has some good memories racing in @entity28 - winning the @entity65 ' @entity25 in 2008 ‘ i do n’t have any fears , ’ he declared			1
‘ honestly , you can look in my eyes , i do n’t have any fears			2
i feel like where i am today is not down to luck			2
there are reasons why we have the best car today and why we ’ve had the results this year			0
that ’s all the hard work that ’s gone in			0
‘ in these last two races i ’m going to do everything i can do , and whatever the result at the end of it , it ’s the way it is , but i will know i did everything i could			1
’ in normal circumstances @entity6 would win the title here if he finished ahead of @entity30 , thus rendering the @entity61 race in a fortnight irrelevant			1
but , no , points at @entity61 count double			1
this new rule is a skewing of the sport ’s integrity - please do n’t laugh - and robs sunday 's race of a potential championship outcome before a wheel is turned in anger			1
@entity30 ( pictured ) and @entity6 's relationship has been tumultuous at times as they battle for the title @entity30 can win the title at @entity61 regardless of @entity6 's position in @entity28 due to offer of double points @entity61 is an awful venue , double scoring or not			1
the weather is predictably dry			0
there is no natural audience			0
a lot of ‘ @entity112 ’ ( business to business ) transactions take place in the oversized hospitality blocks but that hardly compensates for the place ’s manifest inadequacies			0
but the @entity61 rulers have written a cheque the size of the desert , c / o mr @entity124 of @entity125 , in exchange for the privilege of staging the finale - and that , my capitalist friends , is that			1
there is simply no use arguing that @entity3 ’ undulating track with its history and its fan base and its capricious weather should have that honour			0
@entity139 ( left ) has been criticised for damaging the integrity of the sport with the double points race @entity6 knows how special @entity28 motor racing is , being an aficionado of @entity145 , an icon who appealed to the rich and poor of his nation alike			1
governments come and go - former @entity149 guerrilla @entity148 has just been re-elected , supposedly , with 51 per cent of the vote - but @entity145 ’s status endures			2
he is buried on a grassy knoll up the road at the @entity155 graveyard			0
the road from @entity158 airport into the sprawl of the city bears his name			0
and only this week , a giant portrait comprising a patchwork of his family ’s denim jeans was unveiled at the @entity166			0
‘ when i was younger , ’ said @entity6 , ‘ i used to put on this one particular video of @entity145 , racing is in my blood			1
i watched that @entity169 knows how many times			0
he really inspired me as a kid and he still does today			0
every now and then someone may mention my name in the same sentence as his , and i feel really proud and honoured by that			0
‘ i come here and i still feel his presence			0
he still lives on through his fans and the country			0
it ’s one of the most special things i ’ve ever seen			0
i met his niece this week and she said his mum is a fan , which is amazing			0
’ @entity185 won three @entity186 before his untimely death in may 1994 @entity188 have called on fans to donate £ 2.35million to save them from closure , the fate that befell fellow strugglers @entity193 on friday			2
administrators announced that @entity193 ’s 200 staff at their factory in @entity197 , @entity198 , had been made redundant			0
it is believed the team , whose driver @entity201 remains critical but stable after his accident in @entity204 , had debts of £ 31m			1
@entity188 , who owe £ 16m , have launched an ambitious crowdfunding project to try to raise funds to compete at the final race in @entity61			1
they will offer ‘ rewards ’ in return for donations			0
the minimum pledge is £ 10			0
by last night they had raised more than £ 100,000 towards their £ 2.35m target			0
@entity193 have folded after administrators confirmed the @entity218 - based outfit have ceased trading @entity188 have called on fans to donate £ 2.35million to save them from a similar fate to @entity193 's			2

@entity6 leads the @entity26 ' @entity25
@entity6 won the @entity224 @entity27 on *november* 2
@entity227 driver holds a 24 - point lead over @entity31 team - mate @entity30 with two races of the season remaining
the pair will be competing at the @entity28 @entity27 on sunday
season - ending race at @entity61 is worth double points
