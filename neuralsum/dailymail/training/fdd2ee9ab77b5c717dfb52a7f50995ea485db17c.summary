by @entity1 reporter published : 00:28 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 01:14 est , 10 september 2013 an elderly woman in @entity4 , @entity2 was helpless early this month as mice crawled onto her body and began gnawing at her face			1
the unnamed resident of @entity9 assisted living in @entity10 is both physically disabled and suffers from dementia and was unable to stop the mice , which drew blood			1
now the woman is on medication to fend off infection and @entity2 elderly advocates are raising the alarm in order that such a thing never happens again			1
appalling : a physically and mentally disabled patient of a @entity2 elderly care facility was unable to fend off mice that were found gnawing at her face september 1 the group @entity24 told the @entity25 that the shocking event occurred september 1			1
' we found out that last sunday , ' said the group 's executive director @entity28			1
' one of the staff of that facility walked into this resident ’s room and found mice nibbling on her face			1
' @entity28 told the @entity37 that the facility has a serious mouse problem and also struggles with a bedbug infestation			1
' the whole facility has a mice situation			2
mice do n’t usually come out unless there ’s an infestation			0
they like to hide from humans , ' she said			0
' this is so unbelievable that this would be happening in @entity2 ’s richest province , that our seniors are having to live under these conditions			0
' ' beyond belief ' : advocate for elderly care @entity28 called the incident ' beyond reprehensible ' and ' utterly appalling ' as her group @entity24 spread word of the incident this week ' there is no excuse for this to be happening in @entity4			1
' @entity28 said the victim is doing as can be expected			1
' she ’s doing okay			0
emotionally it impacted her and she ’s on medication to prevent infection			0
' the facility sits next to expansive farmland at the edge of town and as harvest season begins , the rodents are displaced from their normal homes in fields by machinery			2
but in addition to that , @entity78 blames insufficient resources			0
creepy : the mice even drew blood and a nest of them was found in the woman 's closet			1
' she ¿ s doing okay			0
emotionally it impacted her and she ¿ s on medication to prevent infection			0
' said @entity28 ' how do you do your job when you ca n’t be everywhere during your shift , ' she asked			1
' it ’s not sufficient			0
it ’s a bigger problem than just the mice			0
it ’s a systemic issue			0
' @entity101 , vice-president of rural operations for @entity103 , which oversees the facility , says the problem is being addressed			2
' now , i do not believe there is a mouse in the building , ' she said			2
' any concern when we hear of people that we care for being harmed while they ’re in our care is very disturbing			2
we do need to take those opportunities to investigate and ensure that we can learn from them , regardless of what the incident is			0
