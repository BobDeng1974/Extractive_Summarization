launched in 2013 for the lonely elderly , volunteers are now taking up to 1,000 calls a day and £ 1 from every album sale will go towards providing much needed funds for the charity			1
the former @entity51 presenter who is now 74 said yesterday : ‘ listening to the music of our youth - which reminds us of the time we dreamed , fell in love , went out with friends , the world was in front of us and nothing seemed impossible - makes us feel young			1
‘ it has been found to turn the clock back , physically , mentally and emotionally			0
so it ’s really good for us			0
’ the music on the £ 12 album , which is being sold by @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , was chosen by @entity36 and the people who benefit from @entity39			1
@entity70 presenter , dame @entity10 ( pictured ) believes music from a bygone age can help benefit the mental health of older people among them is 93 - year - old @entity77 , who moved @entity79 listeners to tears last year after sharing a poem that he wrote to his late wife @entity82 following her death from @entity84 ’s			1
in their youth @entity85 and mrs @entity86 danced to many of the songs on the album			2

the music on the album is also a soundtrack to dame @entity36 ’s life and she shares one of her memories , involving her former husband @entity101 who died from heart disease in 2010 , on the sleeve notes : ‘ @entity2 [ @entity2 ] singing @entity104 is a lovely but sad ballad , expressing the pangs of parting			1
' my late husband , @entity101 , used to sing it to me when he had to leave , but as he was completely tone - deaf , we used to dissolve into laughter , and that eased the pain and gave us a joyous memory , until we met again			2
‘ and @entity115 [ by @entity116 ] always reminds me of the balloon flight he gave me as a birthday gift , when i flew so fast in a beautiful balloon that we landed with a crash in a bramble bush			0
' you , too , will have so many personal memories as you listen to this collection , of tears and laughter			0
’ @entity36 ’s relationship with mr @entity101 began as an affair in 1968 , when they both worked at the @entity132			0
they married in 1977 , had three children and spent 30 years together until his death , aged 69			0
three years ago , after her youngest child @entity136 moved out , @entity36 sold the family home and moved into a two - bedroom flat			2
at the age of 71 she found herself living alone , and the experience prompted her to set up @entity39			2
@entity40 ( left ) , @entity41 ( right ) and @entity42 are also among artists who feature on the album music by @entity42 ( pictured in 2013 ) also features on the album which is being sold by @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
all proceeds from the £ 12 compilation will go towards @entity36 ’s @entity39 helpline charity last year @entity36 said : ' i was coming home to a dark flat with no one to make a cup of tea with and no one to ask about my day , it hit me quite profoundly			2
' when i started to talk about it working in the elderly care sector , i realised how it resonated with so many hundreds of thousands of people			0
' one of the things i discovered was the stigma attached to loneliness , people do n't like admitting it , partly because they do n't want to be a burden , and partly because they 're ashamed , they feel humiliated by this feeling nobody wants them or cares about them			0
' so there is a pride and an independence in the older generation			0
we want them to know that they 're not alone and that we do care			0
