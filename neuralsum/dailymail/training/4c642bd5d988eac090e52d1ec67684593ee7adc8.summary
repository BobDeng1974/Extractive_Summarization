by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:23 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 04:01 est , 5 december 2012 @entity4 intelligence on counter- terrorism operations may have been stolen by a rogue @entity7 official , it emerged last night			1
security chiefs in the @entity9 have been warned that hugely sensitive information they provided to the @entity11 , @entity7 ’s spy agency , could have been ‘ compromised ’			1
hundreds of thousands of pages of classified documents were copied by a senior it technician for the @entity11 , which he then copied for himself on to portable storage devices carrying them away in a backpack			0
warned : the @entity4 , based in @entity18 ( pictured ) , was warned top secret information may have been compromised by the data theft @entity7 officials believe the suspect intended to sell the stolen data and have alerted both @entity4 and @entity25 ’s @entity24			1
the information was shared between @entity9 , @entity7 and the @entity25 and the @entity24 has also been warned about the risk			1
the technician , whose name has not been made public , was arrested by @entity7 authorities last summer			0
he was later released from prison while a criminal investigation by the office of @entity7 's federal attorney general continues			1
a @entity36 security source said it is believed the it worker became disgruntled when he felt his advice on operating the data systems was not being taken seriously			2
the technician downloaded hundreds of thousands , or even millions , of printed pages of classified material from the @entity7 intelligence service 's servers onto portable hard drives			1
he then carried them out of government buildings in a backpack			0
investigators now believe warning signs were missed in the months leading to his arrest			0
the source said that the suspect became so disgruntled earlier this year that he stopped showing up for work			0
share : @entity4 , headed by sir @entity57 , pictured , regularly shares information with the @entity24 and @entity7 intelligence service he worked for the @entity11 , which is part of @entity7 's @entity63 - for about eight years			1
he was described by one source as a ‘ very talented ’ technician			0
the worker also had ‘ administrator rights ’ , which gave him unrestricted access to most or all of the @entity11 's networks , including those holding vast caches of secret data			2
@entity7 investigators seized portable storage devices containing the stolen data after they arrested the suspect			1
the information was impounded before he had an opportunity to sell it			0
however , @entity7 investigators could not be positive he did not manage to pass any of the information on before his arrest			2
representatives of @entity25 and @entity9 intelligence agencies had no immediate response to detailed queries about the case submitted by news agency @entity89			0
@entity7 attorney general @entity90 and a senior prosecutor , @entity92 , announced in september they were investigating the data theft and its alleged perpetrator			2
a spokeswoman for the attorney general said she was prohibited by law from disclosing the suspect 's identity			0
a spokesman for the @entity11 said he could not comment on the investigation			0
security procedures and structures at the @entity11 , which was set up relatively recently , have now come under increased scrutiny			1
it conducts both foreign and domestic intelligence activities for the @entity7 government			2
danger : the @entity24 , based in @entity108 ( pictured ) , was warned secret information may have been compromised human resources staff are currently linked within the organisation to the agency 's information technology division			1
this potentially made it difficult or confusing for the subdivision 's personnel to investigate themselves , the source said			0
despite warning signs , @entity7 news reports say the @entity11 did not realise something was amiss until the largest @entity7 bank , @entity122 , expressed concern to authorities about a potentially suspicious attempt to set up a new numbered bank account , which then was traced to the @entity11 technician			2
a @entity7 parliamentary committee is now conducting its own investigation into the data theft and is expected to report next spring			0
investigators are known to be concerned that the @entity11 lacks investigative powers , such as to search premises or conduct wiretaps , which are widely used by counter-intelligence investigators in other countries			0
news of the theft of intelligence data surfaced with @entity7 's reputation for secrecy and discretion in government and financial affairs already under assault			1
@entity7 authorities have been investigating , and in some cases have charged , whistleblowers and some @entity36 government officials for using criminal methods to acquire confidential financial data about suspected tax evaders from @entity7 's traditionally secretive banks			1
one source said the @entity24 and @entity4 routinely shared data on counter-terrorism and other issues with the @entity11			1
the greatest danger would be the leaking of any information which could identify @entity9 agents or operations , though there is no suggestion this has happened .			0

suspect *walked* out of @entity7 intelligence service @entity11 with stolen data after becoming ' disgruntled ' with his *job*
@entity4 and @entity24 both warned secret information could have been compromised
@entity7 's @entity11 security procedures now under scrutiny
