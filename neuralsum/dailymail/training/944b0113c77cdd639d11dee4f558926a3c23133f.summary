five geckos sent into space in an experiment to see the effects of weightlessness on sexual behaviour have all died			1
the reptiles were launched into orbit by @entity9 's federal space agency on the @entity11 satellite to see how zero gravity would effect their reproductive habits			1
but after the satellite returned to earth this week , scientists revealed the animals have not survived the journey and are suspected of having frozen to death			1
five geckos - one male and four females - were sent into space by @entity9 scientists to see how zero gravity would effect their sexual behaviour			1
file photo the satellite was launched from @entity30 in july , carrying geckos , silkworm eggs , fruit flies and mushrooms for different experiments			0
after @entity9 's space agency lost contact with the satellite later that month , a connection was re-established before the satellite landed yesterday			1
a journalist from the country , @entity41 , tweeted live updates from the touch - down and revealed the fate of the animals - one of which was male and other four female			1
next to a photo of the satellite , he tweeted : ' # @entity52 lands successfully '			0
but he later added : ' all # geckos onboard landed # @entity11 satellite are found dead ' a representative at the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , which was carrying out the experiment , told @entity9 news agency @entity59 : ' it 's still too early to talk about the geckos ' cause of death			1
' but a source involved in the mission later revealed that ' preliminary information ' indicated the geckos had frozen			2
it was the latest accident for @entity9 's space programme , which had two rockets crash recently			2
file photo the @entity71 reported the source as saying : ' most likely , this happened due to a failure of the equipment meant to ensure the temperature of the box with the animals			0
' it is believed the fruit flies on board survived the conditions in space			0
the first animals ever sent into space were fruit flies , who were shot into the air on a @entity89 v2 rocket in 1947			2
two years later , @entity90 was the first monkey sent into space , but died when his parachute failed on his return			0
in 1957 , the first animal into orbit , a dog named @entity96 , was launched aboard the @entity99 , the second - ever orbiting spacecraft			0
@entity96 also died during the flight			0
since then , mice , rabbits , frogs , rats , wasps and even a tortoise have all been sent into space , but rarely survive the experience .			0

one male and four female **lizards** *blasted* into space by @entity9 scientists
they *wanted* to see effect of zero gravity on the creatures ' sexual behaviour
but after the satellite landed yesterday , it was revealed they had died in orbit
it is thought the **lizards** - the latest animals to die in space - may have frozen
