a greedy bee who flew headfirst into a flower looks like he could be a robot in disguise - after pulling off a near - perfect impression of his namesake from the multi-billion dollar @entity8			0
the podgy bee was caught on camera looking just like the robot @entity12 from the @entity15 series - as he raises his front legs in a bid to stand up , covered in bright yellow pollen			1
amateur photographer @entity20 , 27 , captured the moment on camera in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25			1
@entity20 had been trying to capture the perfect close up picture of a bumblebee and finally got this snap covered in pollen , the bee , left , looks more like its namesake in the @entity33 franchise , right mr @entity20 , who works as a chef , had been trying to capture a perfect close - up shot of a bumblebee and , after being stung by wasps several times , finally managed to capture this moment			1
he said : ' this was a particularly big bee , and he 'd been drinking a lot of pollen			2
' he was covered in it so much that he was struggling to fly away , so i moved in to take a picture			2
' he obviously was n't happy about me getting too close though , so raised up on his back legs to try to protect his pollen			2
' i knew that was the moment i needed to capture			0
the bee was particularly large and reared up to protect its pollen when mr @entity20 edged too close ' i love taking close shots of bees and wasps by going very close to them slowly			1
this takes a lot of patience as a decent shot can take up to several hours			0
' i enjoy insects and animals so i was n't scared to go up close to them , however a couple of time i did get bitten by wasps which was n't very pleasant			0
' it was worth it to get a shot like this though			0

the snap was taken by amateur photographer @entity20 , 27
the insect was *collecting* pollen at @entity23 , @entity24
it reared up to protect its pollen when mr @entity20 began to edge close
covered in *spores* , it looked like character @entity12 from @entity33
