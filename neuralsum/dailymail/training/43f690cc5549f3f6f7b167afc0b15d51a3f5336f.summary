by @entity0 a young boy filmed a shark swimming in the shallows of a popular tourist beach in @entity5			1
grabbing his father 's mobile phone , the boy dashed to the water 's edge to capture the footage , showing the shark swimming just metres away from him			1
the sighting comes just days after beaches were closed in both the @entity14 and @entity15 - near @entity16 - following blue shark sightings			1
referring to himself simply as @entity19 , the father of the boy told @entity21 newspaper : ' its body was very thin			2
it looked a bit listless and really disorientated			0
it was n't at all aggressive			0
' hi wife @entity26 added : ' the @entity27 could n't believe us at first			2
fortunately we had the video as proof			0
' the animal has been identified as a blue shark , the same species that has also closed other beaches in both @entity35 and @entity15 in recent days			1

swimming was also banned at several beaches in the @entity14 last wednesday , including @entity43 near @entity44 , after a number of blue shark sightings			1
holiday spot : the blue shark was spotted near the beaches on the popular island of @entity5 dramatic footage : the young boy grabbed his dad 's mobile phone to video the shark in the shallows on a @entity5 beach attacks on humans by blue sharks are very rare and of the nine that have been recorded , most involved divers who had been fishing and had attached their catch to their belts			1
however , it is considered extremely unusual to spot the sharks so close to the shore and experts are concerned they could have followed fishing boats into the shallows , which would mean they are in feeding mode			0
@entity73 , chairman of the @entity74 , told @entity75 : ' if i had a beach full of people i would probably close it			0
if they follow a fishing boat in they are in the feeding mode , and the last thing you really want them to do is swim around people			0
