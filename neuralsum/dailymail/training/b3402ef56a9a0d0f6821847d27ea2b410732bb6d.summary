by @entity1 reporter ' this definitely brightened my day ' : sidelined skier @entity4 brought home a rescue dog after announcing she ca n't compete in next month 's @entity7 @entity4 cheered herself up on wednesday after announcing she 'll be missing the @entity7 by picking up a new four - legged friend			1
the injury - plagued downhill ski champ and her high - profile lover @entity10 chose @entity11 , a 9 - month - old boxer mix , because he has injuries just like hers			1
' he has a bad knee , just like me , ' a limping @entity15 told reporters as she led the pup from a @entity19 , @entity20 shelter			1
@entity15 first saw the injured dog the day before @entity22 , according to @entity23			1
at the time , her boyfriend woods wanted a different dog			2
but workers at @entity28 in @entity19 said she came back annmouncing ' i won ! ' before adopting @entity11			1
down in the dumps @entity15 posted a photo of herself with the dog on @entity34 wednesday evening			1
' @entity11 brightened my day , ' she wrote			1
' has a bum knee bc a car hit him # bumkneebuddies # puppylove			1
' @entity15 is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time , but a february 2013 knee injury while skiing in @entity44 has since seriously sidetracked her career			1
until tuesday , @entity15 had remained upbeat nonetheless			2
less than two weeks after reconstructive right knee surgery in february 2013 , @entity4 already was sounding a positive note , saying she was ' really looking forward to @entity48 ' and defending her @entity50 downhill gold medal			1
along the way to the next @entity52 , though , @entity15 began facing more setbacks			2
as she 'd move past one , another would surface			0
in the end , it was too much , even for @entity15 , the most accomplished @entity58 ski racer in history			2
expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming games , @entity15 announced tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony — she wo n't be able to race in @entity64			1
' like many in her risk - filled sport , @entity15 has dealt with injuries often , particularly at major events			1
she withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion			0
she raced with a severely bruised shin at the last @entity81			0
she skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle			0
she hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds			0
she took a scary fall during training at the @entity104 , then left the hospital to compete			0
' she 's come back			0
she 'll be back , ' @entity15 's father , @entity106 , said in a telephone interview			2
' you 'll see a lot of @entity4 in the future			0
' @entity15 left the 2010 @entity111 with two medals : the first @entity50 downhill gold for an @entity58 woman , and a bronze in the super- @entity116 she is also a four - time overall @entity117 champion , by far the most recognized name in @entity119 at the moment — and , as it happens , the girlfriend of @entity10			1
withdrawal : @entity4 and her partner @entity10 were together the day before christmas eve when the skier first met the kindred spirit canine add it all up , and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in @entity48 , certainly a main character in @entity132 's coverage for a @entity58 audience			0
' @entity4 gives you great promotional value , and she 's an amazing athlete and an amazing story , ' said @entity137 , president of @entity81			0
' but there are amazing athletes that are going to be in @entity48 , many of which we know , some of which we have n't identified yet			0
' to those in the world of skiing , there 's no doubt about the sport 's most important athlete of late			0
' without @entity4 , the races are just not the same , ' @entity154 women 's @entity119 coach @entity152 said last month			0
' she just attracts so much interest			0
when @entity4 is here , there are more people coming to watch the race , there is more interest on tv , more journalists are interested			0
and her relationship with @entity10 makes even more people interested			0
' complicated surgery : this picture shows @entity4 and her team as she recovered from her surgical reconstruction of her right knee following her accident in @entity44 in february 2013 @entity4 of the @entity58 is helicoptered off the course during the @entity172 on february 05 , 2013 in @entity173 , @entity44 painstaking : in march 2013 - skier @entity4 published this picture to @entity34 that revealed the extent of her injury and subsequent surgery to fix the damage caused but @entity15 has rarely been present on the elite skiing circuit the past 12 months			1
she tore two ligaments in her right knee and broke a bone in that leg during a high - speed crash at the world championships last february			1
as @entity15 neared a return , she re-tore her surgically repaired @entity186 in a crash during training in november			2
after finishing 40th , 11th and fifth in a trio of @entity117 races at @entity191 , @entity192 , in early december , @entity15 sprained her mcl during a downhill at @entity195 , @entity196 , two weeks later			2
' i did everything i possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no @entity186 , ' @entity15 said tuesday via @entity79 .			2

@entity15 picked up her new 9 - month - old dog named @entity11 at @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity20
she told staff she and @entity207 have adjoining homes nearby and two other dogs @entity11 can play with
