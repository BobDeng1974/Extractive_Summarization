it ’s a mansion fit for a @entity10 villain			0
or , in this case , a 24 - year - old painter and decorator and his wife who scooped £ 45million on the lottery			0
newlyweds @entity16 and @entity18 have lodged plans for their dream house , a £ 5million eco-home called @entity22			1
designed to shield the couple from prying eyes , it will also boast a snooker room , gym , jacuzzi , acoustically - sealed pods and even staff quarters			1
it ’s certainly a very long way from their old home , a £ 89,950 ex-council house in @entity45 , @entity27			1
just after their @entity48 windfall , in february 2012 , mr @entity46 told a press conference : ‘ i have often painted these huge houses and wondered what it would be like to live in one			0
now i can find out			0
’ @entity22 ’s architects describe the property as a ‘ 21st century update of the traditional country house ’			0
artist 's impression : the house will have eight bedrooms plus a swimming pool and private cinema estate : the property is set in a country park which the couple bought for £ 1.2million change of scenery : @entity16 and @entity18 were living in this semi-detached house in @entity45 when they won their fortune the plans involve demolishing a 1930s mansion overlooking a country park , which the couple bought for £ 1.2million last year			1
its most remarkable feature is its underground garage , built to accommodate the couple ’s growing collection of cars			1
after their windfall they swapped their @entity84 city car for a @entity85 and @entity86 , worth a combined £ 150,000			0
mr @entity46 is also said to have also splashed out on a @entity87 and @entity88			0
the cars will be glimpsed through a waterfall , created from rainwater which will collect in a pool at the centre of the house			2
this will cascade into a second pool below , producing a ‘ water curtain ’			2
in a statement released through their architects yesterday , mr @entity46 and his 23 - year - old wife , a former @entity99 supermarket supervisor , said : ‘ must - haves [ for the new house ] included five bedrooms , a dramatic sweeping staircase , a large garage and a grotto - style pool			1
jackpot : mr and mrs @entity18 won £ 45million on the @entity48 lottery last february generous : the pair have paid off relatives ' mortgages and given millions away to close friends ‘ we also spent a lot of time debating with the architect how the rooms would be used and the split between open plan and entertaining spaces versus cosy , snug rooms			1
we were very clear we did n’t want to live in a glass box			0
at the very top of our wish list was a strong desire to keep the design contemporary yet familiar , and flexible enough to accommodate a future family			0
’ they told @entity133 - based architects @entity131 the new home had to be ‘ luxurious , environmentally - friendly and playful			2
’ the four hubs will be divided into ‘ a formal entertaining hub , a family hub , games hub and an annex ’ , with a half - storey of steps between each			0
@entity143 , of @entity144 , said : ‘ visitors arrive via a grand hall where a majestic staircase sweeps up to a cinema room and study , contained in two acoustically sealed pods hovering above a drawing room			2
’ the @entity27 project is likely to be one of the most ambitious new homes built in the @entity155			1
@entity131 submitted an application yesterday , but planners are unlikely to consider it until the summer			0
last night mr @entity46 ’s father , @entity159 , said the couple were enjoying an extended touring holiday in @entity162			2
he said they had had a ‘ lot of input ’ into the design of their planned home , adding : ‘ i ’m not going to say where the house will be built but it is quite local			2
‘ @entity16 has no plans to move – all his friends are around here			1

@entity16 and @entity18 apply to build new home in @entity27
@entity176 will have eight bedrooms , a swimming pool and a private cinema
