actress @entity0 has hit back at an oil company which accused her of ' deliberately distorting the facts ' in a charity appeal about plans to test for oil in @entity7 's oldest national park			1
the @entity9 - born star , who repeatedly refers to the park as ' this place ' in the three - minute plea , said she would have ' loved ' to cross the border into the drilling site - but was not allowed to due to the ' armed conflict '			1
she added that she used the phrase ' behind me is @entity18 ' - deeming the accusations ' pathetic ' and ' paltry '			0
@entity0 , who was filmed sat high on a mountain against a backdrop of thick jungle and glimmering lakes , told viewers that it is ' absolutely crazy ' to contemplate ' exploring for oil right there '			2
the 37 - year - old said is it ' absolutely crazy ' to contemplate exploring for oil at the @entity44 but @entity45 , the @entity46 - based company set to start tests early next year in @entity18 , in the @entity31 , said the appeal was filmed 25 miles away from the drilling site			1
the production , directed by @entity51 , is being shown as one of the main trailers before films in more than 100 cinemas across the @entity56			0
@entity0 's repetition of ' this place ' throughout the film could suggest to viewers the 37 - year - old is standing among the endangered habitat , @entity45 claims			1
however , the actress has hit back at the oil firm - saying : ' i am astonished at this paltry attempt to use semantics to divert attention from the real issue			1
the plea was directed by @entity51 , pictured with @entity0 at the screening of the production in @entity46 on october 14 ' i am delighted to have used the specific words " behind me is @entity18 " , and to be in the fortunate position of never having used any expression which may have indicated that i was other than where i was when filming			2
' i would have loved to have been able to cross the border into the park but we were not allowed to due to the armed conflict			1
' this is a pathetic attempt by @entity45 stop people focusing on the fact they are looking to explore for oil in a world heritage site			2
' wildlife charity @entity40 claims the planned oil tests could ' devastate the fragile ecosystem ' , of the 3,000 sq m @entity44 , threatening the park 's critically endangered mountain gorillas , the @entity85 reported			1
@entity0 did not visit @entity18 because it lies inside the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) and the @entity90 advises against travelling there			2
instead , the film was shot 25 miles away , on a mountain top in neighbouring @entity38			1
from her vantage point the actress could see part of the sprawling site			0
' behind me is @entity18			0
i think it 's one of the most beautiful places on our planet and they are about to start exploring for oil right there , ' she tells viewers			0
' it seems absolutely crazy			0
it is the last place on @entity110 we should think about doing such a thing			0
' @entity113 said the area they plan to explore for oil , @entity117 , contains no gorillas			0
the firm told the @entity85 , @entity0 visited sites in @entity38 , areas which bear little resemblance to the site in @entity124 where seismic testing is scheduled to start early next year			1
the company said : ' the clever use of animals and lush jungle shots depicted in the film that are simply not in the area of interest in @entity117 is misleading			0
wildlife charity @entity40 claim plans to explore parts of @entity18 for oil will threaten the critically endangered mountain gorilla population ' @entity40 must be aware of this and thus we can only conclude that the @entity40 is deliberately distorting the facts			1
' he said the press release accompanying the film made it clear that @entity0 had travelled to @entity38 , and added that care was taken to ensure the script was factually correct			1
the team spent five days on the edge of the park and viewed reels of footage to learn more about the area at risk			0
' it would have been great to take her there and if there had been any way of doing it safely we would have done so , ' he added			0
@entity161 , @entity45 's deputy chief executive criticised the @entity40 campaign for telling the @entity31 , the world 's poorest nation , that it should not exploit its natural resources			2
he rejected claims made by the charity that a road due to be built to allow for the company 's plans could encourage hunting and poaching			1
he the firm aims to reduce the risk by creating jobs for local people , who might otherwise be tempted to kill rare animals for commerical gain			0
he told the paper @entity45 had invited @entity0 and @entity40 to visit @entity117 to see for themselves the poverty of the area .			2
