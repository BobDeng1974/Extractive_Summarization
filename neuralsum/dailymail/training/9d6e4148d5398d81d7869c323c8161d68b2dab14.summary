but in addition there will be an edge to the game after @entity0 and @entity3 striker @entity23 had a disagreement on the pitch with more verbal jousting continuing in the tunnel after the whistle			1
the @entity44 midfielder played down the incident but his actions indicate that @entity1 are prepared to stand toe - to - toe with any opponent			2
in relation to the headlines which followed his confrontation with @entity23 , @entity0 said : ' i was a little bit surprised ... but of course i do n't know what you are talking about it			1

@entity1 , @entity3 - two big teams			1
' i have n't really thought about it , it does n't really bother me			0

' you have to be strong mentally and physically and i think we have been that recently			0
@entity1 manager @entity70 has been pleased with @entity0 's leadership qualities @entity70 could be tempted to bring @entity72 back into the squad for the game against @entity3 ' we have shown we can be physical when we need to be but we just have to keep going			1
' manager @entity70 has spoken glowingly of the 24 - year - old 's growing leadership skills and the player himself feels there is extra onus on him to stand up for his team - mates having been made @entity28 's deputy earlier this season			2
' i feel i have to take a bit more responsibility on and off the field to especially help the younger players coming through as i 've been through the same sort of thing - but that goes for all the experienced players in the team , ' he added			0
' there have been some tough times but we have dug in , stuck together as a team and we have come out the other side in the last month or two and been much better so hopefully we can keep going from strength to strength			0

' the confidence has grown over the last month or two , we 've picked up some really good results and the team spirit has been fantastic so it is a good opportunity for us on tuesday			0
' the game might be a little bit different , they will be coming straight at us from the off and they have some fantastic players but we are a good team so we need to defend like we have been doing and hurt them on the break			0
