@entity1 of @entity2 and @entity3 's breasts are scientifically perfect , according to a formula which stipulates the ideal position of the nipples which is backed by a public poll			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are also blessed with the ' perfect ' proportions , having an ideally placed ' nipple meridian ' , a new study has revealed			1
the ideal proportions are 45 per cent of the breast above the line of the nipples and a generous 55 per cent below			1
he believes the most - appealing female breasts should be only slightly smaller above the nipple than below			1
to support his hypothesis , he asked more than 1,300 people to rank four breast types with different proportions			0
the poll found that 87 per cent of respondents ranked breasts of the same 45:55 ratio as @entity12 as their favourites			1
dr @entity63 , said : ' in the past , most women have walked into a clinic thinking they ’re going to get a couple of round footballs because fullness is a desired look in clothing and women tend to picture themselves dressed			0
' but this does n’t equate to attractiveness in the naked breast			0
most surgeons give women what they think they want			0
' and hey presto , plastic surgery gets a bad name for promoting a fake and distorted image			0
' i ’m not saying women must conform to this ‘ ideal ’ that works both clothed and naked , it merely gives surgeons around the world a technical and aesthetic roadmap for any women choosing to have breast enhancement to get the best results			0
' dr @entity25 , of the @entity46 and @entity47 , said it is the relative size of the upper and lower halves of breasts that holds the secret of the perfect bust second best : @entity98 's breasts have an equal 50:50 ratio , the favourite of 9 per cent of respondents @entity102 last : @entity104 's top heavy 55:45 ratio breasts , were the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents , as were @entity107 's pert 35:65s , shown here in a daring awards ceremony gown it is estimated that between five and 10 million women across the world have had cosmetic breast surgery breasts like those of @entity98 , with an equal 50:50 ratio , were rated top by 9 per cent ; 55:45 ratio breasts , like @entity104 's and @entity42 's , and 35:65s , like @entity107 's , were each the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents			1
the survey also revealed that more men prefer natural looking breasts than women - in stark contrast to the cliché that men prefer oversized or ‘ fake ’ breasts			1
other women whose breasts fit dr @entity25 's ' perfect ' template include @entity133 , the underwear model			1
but dr @entity25 has said previously that @entity136 's surgically enhanced bust had often been pointed out to him by clients as an example of what they did n't want to end up looking like			2
dr @entity63 first identified the formula for perfect breasts in 2007 when observing the commonalities of topless models , chosen for their naturally attractive breasts			1
since then he has championed the adoption of this aesthetic and has urged other surgeons to use the 45:55 ratio as a template for design in breast surgery			0
this golden ratio for breasts is not just a modern phenomenon			2
throughout history , from the earliest representations of woman to the statues of antiquity , from @entity162 masters to modern photographers , artists have chosen the same proportions			2
throughout history , dr @entity63 , said artists have chosen the same proportions @entity170 and @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , society ’s leading ladies have always had ' @entity174 's '			1
' just like beautiful landscapes , everyone agrees on what beautiful breasts look like , ' dr @entity63 added			2
' identifying the 45:55 ideal proportions now gives women the opportunity to tell their surgeons what they really want			0
' i am increasingly seeing women who have finished having children and want to take control of their bodies again			0
' and this is the look that gives them the best results and most satisfaction			0
' separate research has shown recently that breasts are the third thing a man notices in a woman he is meeting for the first time , and that men with more sexist views prefer bigger - breasted women			2
nearly 70 per cent of 1,000 men who took part in the former study insisted that eyes are the first feature of a woman they gaze at .			0

@entity3 , the @entity34 , @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity214 's breasts chosen as favourite by 87 per cent in poll
they are slightly fuller below the ' nipple meridian ' than above
that means her nipples point upwards at an angle of 20 degrees
