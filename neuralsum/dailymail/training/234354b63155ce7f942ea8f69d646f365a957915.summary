when asked what exactly she sees in a person 's bottom , @entity9 said : ' it tells me about the character of a person , the good points and the bad points			1
' she then went on to predict big changes for @entity7 , including the possibility of a relocation to @entity36 and a new relationship			1
and i think she 's now ready for a new romance in her life			2
' looking at the photograph of @entity7 , @entity10 quickly interjected with : ' what told you that ? @entity52 ? ' @entity9 replied : ' no , it 's the right cheek that was telling me all the past things , the left cheek tells all the future things			1
it 's telling me she might go to @entity36 and even settle down there			1
' moving on to a photograph of @entity8 's posterior , @entity9 said : ' well , she 's quite a feisty lady , and i would say a perfectionist			1
' i would say she 's quite happy as well , and also that she 'll get broody soon because one of her friends is going to have a baby girl			2
i would also say she 's going to do more charity work , which will change her life in some way			2
' @entity9 talks @entity10 and @entity11 through rumpology while looking at the bottom belonging to the first volunteer volunteer one was @entity73 from @entity74 , who was told her bottom made her seem fun and not too serious @entity10 and @entity11 then asked @entity9 to read three mystery celebrity that were protruding through three holes in a wall			1

@entity92 's @entity91 - who is a @entity94 lookalike - was the second mystery bottom celebrity transsexual @entity96 appeared in front of the screen as the third mystery bottom reading the second volunteer 's rear , @entity9 said : ' this person likes tattoos for special occasions and likes to be outside a lot			1

i 'm not sure if they 're a presenter or a comedian			0
i get that fun to be around thing			0
' the volunteer was revealed as @entity92 ' @entity116 ' @entity115 , who was moderately impressed but said he really preferred hotels to being outside			0
when it came to the third one , @entity9 said : ' i 'm a bit all over the place with this one			1
i think they 're going through quite an emotional time			0
they like to be in control , they are a bit of comedian , they like to play pranks on people			0

@entity137 does rump readings @entity140 's mother @entity139 , who appeared on celebrity big brother in 2005 , is one of @entity36 's foremost rumpologists			1
she believes that rump reading is an art that was practiced in ancient @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 , considering the rear to be the key to health and fidelity , and what determined potential talents and future success			0
' @entity156 is the art of reading the lines , crevices , dimples , and folds of the buttocks to divine the individual 's character and gain an understanding of what has occurred in the past and get a prediction of the future			2
' @entity139 has discovered that the left and right cheeks reveal a person 's past and future , respectively			0
the right buttocks represents the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain , while the left buttocks represents the right hemisphere			0
it is similar to palmistry -- where the left palm represents the past and the right palm represents the future			0
a rump report from @entity137 can tell you whether you are going " ass - backwards " or eyes open into the future			2
