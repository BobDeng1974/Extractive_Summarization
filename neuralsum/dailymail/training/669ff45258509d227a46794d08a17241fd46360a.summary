an 18 - year - old former public schoolboy who shot primary school children with a bb gun to ' let off steam ' has been spared prison			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , took potshots from a window of his parents ' home at children aged between eight and 10 playing in the grounds of a neighbouring primary school			1
when he was arrested a tearful @entity5 told police he ' was letting off steam ' during his exams			1
former public schoolboy @entity5 ( pictured left ) has avoided prison despite admitting to shooting at primary school children with a bb gun in may 2013 - he was instead ordered to carry out community service he admitted culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm - but today avoided jail and was instead sentenced to 200 hours community service @entity5 has twice had his sentence deferred - once to finish his exams and another to go on a charity trip to @entity26			1
during the may 2013 incident he shot at and hit a group of young children who were playing in the grounds of @entity31 during their lunch break			1
several of the children were hit by the pellets - one girl was struck on the forehead and another was hit just below the eye			2
@entity5 ( pictured ) has twice had today 's sentencing deferred - once to finish his @entity41 exams and another to go on a charity trip to @entity26 others had red marks and bruising on their arms , legs , stomach and heads			1
today , a sheriff said @entity5 had an ' uncommon fascination ' with firearms and had committed a serious crime when he fired at the children in @entity7 in 2013			1
but after taking into account his previously clean record and guilty plea the judge ordered him to serve 200 hours of community service			1
sheriff @entity59 ordered @entity5 to complete his community service over the next nine months			1
she said : ' i would have given you the maximum of 300 hours , but because you pled guilty it will be 200 hours			0
' she added @entity5 had ' an uncommon fascination , like other young people , with firearms '			2
after hearing a plea from @entity5 's defence lawyer for him to be admonished - the judicial equivalent of a verbal warning - the sheriff replied : ' @entity72 is impossible due to the seriousness of the offence			2
' but the father of one of children slammed the sentence and said @entity5 should have been jailed			1
he said @entity5 was getting off lightly because he had attended the £ 10,000 - a - year @entity79 in the city			0
he said : ' this young man was shooting at children			0
if he had hit one of them in the eye it could have been life - changing for them			0
' he went to a private school and i think that is the reason why he got off lightly			0
anyone else would have been sentenced a long time ago and not been let off to go to @entity26			0
this ten - year - old ( pictured left ) was shot with a bb gun pellet in the arm ( right ) along with his friends ' this was a chance to make a point about firearms but they have just let this person walk - it 's ridiculous			2
' he must have fired that gun loads of times which shows he had no remorse after hitting the first child			0
' since this happened we have been keeping an eye on similar cases and people have ended up in jail , which should have happened in this instance			0
' outside court , @entity5 told reporters : ' i do n't want to speak			2
' @entity118 conservatives previously criticised the delays in sentencing @entity5			0
today a spokesman said : ' we feel that the sentence is appropriate			0
' former public schoolboy @entity5 was a student at the £ 10,000 - a - year @entity79 in @entity7			0
