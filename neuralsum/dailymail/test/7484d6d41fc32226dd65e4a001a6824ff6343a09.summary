it 's truly squeaky bum time in the @entity3 relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams			1
@entity6 asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season			2
question : ' what will it take for your club to stay in the @entity3 ? ' @entity18 ( @entity19 ) ' if we win three games i think we will stay up			1
i 'm not saying that 's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning , starting with this weekend			2
to do that , we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience			2
' @entity19 manager @entity18 ( centre ) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games @entity36 ( @entity37 ) ' i do n't know how many points it will take			1
nothing 's been achieved yet			2
i 'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing			2
they have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win			0
something was probably a little bit missing previously			0
i want to make sure that i do n't take my foot off pedal			0
i 'll make sure the players do n't			0
' @entity36 ( left ) believes his appointment at @entity37 has given them a lot of belief and confidence @entity63 ( @entity64 ) ' we 've put ourselves in a position now where we have a more realistic chance			1
that 's where we are			0
if it raises optimism elsewhere , fine			0
if it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us , fine also			0
but as far as i 'm concerned it 's about making sure we 're back to business when we play @entity79			1
because it 's a really big game for both sides			0
we 've got players in decent form			0
we want to keep the work ethic that we 've shown all season			0
' @entity64 manager @entity63 ( right ) hopes his side can continue their momentum against @entity79 @entity88 ( @entity79 ) ' the biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation			1
our fuel is about staying in the @entity3			1
it 's a slightly different twist			0
' others are scared of relegation			1
we 're not scared of relegation because we were told by everyone we were going to get relegated			2
we are actually looking for the goal of being in the @entity3			1
' @entity88 insists his side are n't scared of relegation as a lot of people have written @entity79 off in the past			1

just nine points separates the bottom seven clubs in the @entity3
@entity19 boss @entity18 says they need three more wins to survive
@entity79 host relegation *rivals* @entity64 in the league on *saturday*
