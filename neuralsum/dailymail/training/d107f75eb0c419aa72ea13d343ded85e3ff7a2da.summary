the ancient people who built @entity2 chose the site in modern - day @entity4 because of its solar significance , archaeologists claim			1
in what is described as a ‘ missing piece in the jigsaw ’ in our understanding of @entity14 ’s greatest prehistoric site , excavations confirm the theory that its ancient processional route was built along an ice - age landform which was naturally on the solstice axis , according to professor @entity19 , a leading expert on @entity2			1
the monument ’s original purpose still remains shrouded in mystery , but this is a dramatic clue , he said			0
the ancient people who built @entity2 chose the site in modern - day @entity4 because of its solar significance , archaeologists claim			1
in what is described as a ' missing piece in the jigsaw ' , excavations confirm the theory that its ancient processional route was built along an ice - age landform the route , known as the @entity31 , extended 1.5 miles from the standing stones ’ north - eastern entrance to @entity34			1
it has been likened to the mall leading to @entity37			0
after the closure of the @entity41 road , which bisected the route , archaeologists have been able to excavate there for the first time			0
the excavations were conducted by @entity46 for @entity47			1
just below the modern road ’s surface , they unearthed ditches dug by prehistoric builders			0
professor @entity19 identified naturally - occurring fissures that once lay between ridges which follow the route of the @entity31			1
the route , known as the @entity31 , extended 1.5 miles from the standing stones north - eastern entrance			0
after the closure of the @entity41 ( pictured ) , archaeologists have been able to excavate there for the first time			0
professor @entity19 identified naturally - occurring fissures that once lay between ridges which follow the route @entity31 is an ancient avenue marked as a @entity64 built between 2600 to 1700 bce			1
it has been likened to the mall leading to @entity37			0
discovered in the 18th century , it measures nearly 3 kilometres and connects @entity2 with the @entity68			1
the avenue is aligned with the sunrise of the summer solstice , suggesting a time of most frequent use			2
at the end of the @entity31 , a similar ring of bluestones , @entity77 , was discovered in 2009			0
@entity19 of the @entity78 believes the @entity31 was inspired by and built over top of a natural glacial formation with an existing astronomical alignment			2
the ridges were created by @entity84 meltwater and naturally point directly at the mid-winter sunset in one direction and the mid-summer sunrise in the other			1
@entity89 is excited by the evidence , which he describes as ‘ hugely significant ’			2
‘ it tells us a lot about why @entity2 was located where it is and why they were so interested in the solstices , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s not to do with worshipping the sun , some kind of calendar or astronomical observatory			0
‘ it ’s about how this place was special to prehistoric people			2
this natural landform happens to be on the solstice axis , which brings heaven and earth into one			2
’ he explained that @entity2 is ‘ all about the solstices ’ and our ancestors could see this in the land			1
the excavations support theories that first emerged in 2008 with an exploration of a narrow trench across the @entity31			2
the ridges were created by @entity84 meltwater and naturally point directly at the mid-winter sunset in one direction and the mid-summer sunrise in the other on the central area of the site there are the stone settings ( in blue ) , with the inner circle consisting of a ' sarsen horseshoe '			1
the outermost element of the site is the @entity31 which consists of twin banks about 12m apart with internal ditches			0
the red lines signify how sunrise aligns with the @entity31 professor @entity19 said : ‘ it ’s being able to see the big picture			2
’ dr @entity140 , @entity47 ’s @entity2 curator , said : ‘ the part of the @entity31 that was cut through by the road has obviously been destroyed forever , but we were hopeful that archaeology below the road would survive			1
‘ and here we have it – the missing piece in the jigsaw			0
it is very exciting to find a piece of physical evidence that officially makes the connection which we were hoping for			2
’ she expects the latest findings to spark vigorous academic debate , and @entity47 has not expressed an opinion on the naturally - formed ridges , their interpretation being confined to the ditches			0
the original @entity41 road is to be grassed over next year as part of @entity47 ’s £ 27m transformation of the @entity64 , which draws more than one million annual visitors			0
a new visitor centre will be opened , 1.5 miles away out of sight , to allow @entity2 to reconnect with the surrounding landscape			1
@entity2 's original purpose still remains shrouded in mystery , but the findings of the natural land formation is a dramatic clue behind why it was located in this area the latest study has also identified three holes where missing stones would have stood on the outer sarsen circle – evidence , it is believed , that the circle was indeed once complete			1
astonishingly , at least to the layman , even the most sophisticated surveys failed to spot them			0
two eagle - eyed members of staff happened to notice dry surface areas of grass , or parchmarks			0
professor @entity19 said : ‘ the problem is we ’ve not had a decent dry summer in many years			0
‘ @entity2 is always regularly watered - and the only reason these have shown up is because - for some reason this year - their hose was too short … so we ’re very lucky			1
’ @entity196 , an @entity47 historian , added : ‘ the discovery … has certainly strengthened the case for [ the monument ] being a full circle			0

excavations confirm that @entity2 was built on an @entity84 landform
ridges found to point at the mid-winter sunset and mid-summer sunrise
experts claim that ancient people believed the *geological* scars signified the ' union of @entity213 ' at the longest and shortest day of the year
evidence has also been found that the now broken circle was once complete
