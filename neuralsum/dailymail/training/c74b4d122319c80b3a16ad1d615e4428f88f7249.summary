by @entity0 for @entity1 up to 500 rhino will be evacuated from @entity3 in @entity4 which has been blighted by poachers hunting them for horns			1
the authorities announced the plan to airlift the animals to safer areas in the country by helicopter because illegal killings have soared in recent years , despite the deployment of soldiers throughout the nature reserve			1
figures show a shocking increase - 13 were illegally killed in 2007 , while 1,004 were butchered last year			0
and this year 630 rhinos have already lost their lives – 408 of them in @entity22			2
' a decision has been made on this issue of translocation , ' said @entity26 , @entity4 's environment minister on tuesday			0
' relocations from the @entity3 and the creation of rhino strongholds could allow the total rhino population size of @entity4 to continue to grow			1
' poaching has decimated the @entity22 rhino @entity33 estimates that there are just 300 black rhino left in the park , and about 3,000 white rhino			1
the safest way to travel : a rhino is hoisted high into the air by its ankles in @entity42 , @entity4 up to 500 animals will be evacuated as a result of poaching , which has decimated the rhino population in a bid to save the endangered black rhino , conservationists have already begun transporting them to new homes to encourage breeding in other nature reserves			1
the video features a black rhino being airlifted from the @entity42 to a new home at a 34,000 hectares reserve in @entity58 , @entity4 , as part of the @entity60			2
the project , a partnership between conservation groups including @entity64 and @entity65 , was set up in 2003 - with the aim of increasing the population of the critically endangered black rhino by expanding its territory			1
over the last decade , nine new black rhino populations have been created in @entity4 , with more than 140 rhinos relocated			1
the beasts were airlifted to a new home at a 34,000 hectares reserve in @entity58 as part of the @entity60 hanging in the balance : illegal rhino killings have soared in recent years , despite the deployment of soldiers through the nature reserve while the sight of the animal hanging from its ankles might be unsettling to some , it is considered safer than transporting it on the ground because the animal spends less time under anaesthetic			2
project leader dr @entity90 said : ' we used to transport rhinos by lorry over very difficult tracks , or airlifted in a net			2
this new procedure has proved to be a safer bet			0
' as a vet , this is my method of choice because it is quick and harmless to the rhinos , which is always our main concern in these operations			0
' all the rhinos have started eating immediately after release – a sure sign that they were not in distress			0
' over the last decade , nine new black rhino populations have been created in @entity4 , with more than 140 rhinos relocated the helicopter translocations usually take less than ten minutes and are used to relocate rhinos from inaccessible areas			1
the purpose of the project , which is in its tenth year , is to increase numbers by providing the animals with more territory to breed on			2
seven of the new breeding sites are in @entity58 and two are further north in @entity124			0
to date more than 40 calves have been born on sites ran by the @entity60			0
good news : over the last decade , nine new black rhino populations have been created in @entity4 , with more than 140 rhinos relocated in the 1960s , an estimated 65,000 black rhino were found across @entity4 but poaching decimated their numbers to just 2,000 in the early 1990s			1
conservation efforts have now doubled numbers to an estimated 4,000 - but poaching remains the biggest threat to their survival			0
@entity137 have become increasingly vulnerable to poaching as demand for the animal 's horns has increased , especially from @entity142			0
some conservationists estimate that rhino horn has a street value of £ 38,000 per kilogram , which makes it more valuable than platinum or gold .			0

@entity64 estimates there are just 300 black rhinos left in @entity3
they have *teamed* up with @entity65 to relocate animals
it is hoped the rhino will be able to breed in safer *wildlife* reserves
