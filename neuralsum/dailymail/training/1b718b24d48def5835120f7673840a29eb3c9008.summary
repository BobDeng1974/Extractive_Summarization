plastic bags are often bemoaned as a scourge of the environment , polluting the natural world with unwanted litter			1
but one professor has shown how they do n't necessarily need to be viewed so negatively			2
he placed them under the microscope to reveal the hidden beauty on a tiny scale in the form of colourful blemishes , patterns and more			2
professor @entity14 from @entity15 has taken microscopic images of plastic bags ( shown )			1
by cutting up bags into little pieces he revealed an amazing array of colours in the objects while these spectacular pictures might look like stained glass windows , they are in fact just everyday plastic bags			1
professor @entity14 , 51 , put a stretched fragment of a bag under a microscope as he was curious to see what it would look like			2
plastic bags are made of nylon which normally appears black under microscopic images			1
but when it is deformed , either through industrial processes or by being torn apart as it was by professor @entity14 , it exhibits unpredictable colours under polarised light â€“ when light waves are aligned parallel to each other			1
each of the images here shows just a small fragment of plastic bag , often just a few millimeters across			2
they show what a basic , colourless plastic bag looks like when it goes under the microscope			0
when zoomed in , the simple plastic carrier displays a stunning array of colourful patterns			2
whilst the bag was under the microscope , professor @entity14 shone a polarised light on it to enhance the colours			1
the colours are created when light is split into its components			0
when it emerges from the plastic certain wavelengths are interfered with , creating the vivid display			0
professor @entity14 , who works as a professor of petrology - the study of rocks - and lives in @entity69 , @entity15 , was told by a friend that plastic bags provide such colourful patterns			1
this inspired him to create the images and reveal the hidden beauty of these almost universally hated objects			0
he said : ' they were taken at a friend 's home			0
she owns a microscope because she 's a geologist			0
' she told me that they provided very colourful images			0
' i was there just to take artistic pictures , but i have been using a microscope for about 30 years for my research and teaching			0
' the amazing patterns became apparent when a piece of bag was shone with polarised light			1
normally nylon - which the bags are made of - appears stark black when viewed under a microscope			1
but cutting it up unto millimeter - sized chunks unveils an array of blemishes professor @entity14 used a stretched fragment of a bag under a microscope as he was curious to see what it would look like whilst the bag was under the microscope , professor @entity14 ( shown ) shone a special polarised light on it to enhance the colours professor @entity14 said that bags without colour actually create more vivid patterns because light can pass better through them			1
he said : ' it was a colourless plastic bag			0
transparent bags work better than coloured ones			0
' not all types of plastic are photogenic - it depends on the thickness and material			0
' plastic gives a lot of curved edges and continuous variations of colours			0
' the colours are " interference colours " that form when polarised light passes through transparent matter such as crystals and in this case plastic			2
' the colours depend on the thickness of the plastic foil , and on the orientation of the polarised light			2
' but while the images might seem amazing professor @entity14 says he does n't have plans to exhibit them in any sort of art exhibit			1
he merely undertook the project for a bit of fun to reveal the beauty of the humble plastic bag			0
