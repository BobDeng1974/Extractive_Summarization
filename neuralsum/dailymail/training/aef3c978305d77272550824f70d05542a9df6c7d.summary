@entity0 claims @entity1 are ‘ a generation behind ’ @entity3 as @entity5 ’s team attempt to win the country ’s fourth @entity6 against @entity8			1
@entity9 has been critical of the @entity1 regime in the past , but believes @entity12 ’s team showed signs of a promising future despite their early exit			1
@entity1 were out of the tournament after defeats against @entity18 and @entity19 in their opening two group games in @entity21			1
the former @entity1 striker said : ‘ when you look to @entity3 , they have always managed to get it right			1
it ’s all about youth development			2
‘ we ’ve made strides but they ’re very recent strides and we ’re a long way behind			2
‘ the future ’s brighter			2
i would n’t be too bleak about it			2
were going along the lines of what @entity3 and @entity52 have done			1
we ’re just a generation behind			1
hot property : @entity56 is one of @entity3 's standout players and has been linked with @entity58 leader : @entity60 has already scored 10 @entity6 goals in his first two tournaments in reserve : @entity64 has proven an effective substitute for @entity3 talent : @entity3 goalkeeper @entity67 is as adept with his feet as many of the outfield players ‘ a couple of defeats and you are gone - that ’s the danger of @entity73			1
‘ there was huge disappointment , but at the same time we all knew before this tournament that most of our players were too young and very inexperienced and our experienced players were perhaps a little bit too mature			1
' the truth was realised , but at the same time we were n’t that bad in the games			1
there was a bit of promise			2
' i do n’t think it was as depressing as four years ago when you could n’t see much future			0
whereas with this bunch in two years time , four years time there is reason for hope			1
’ ' we are addressing issues			2
it ’s unbelievable that it ’s only in the last two or three years we ’ve started with small sided pitches and small goals			0
finally we ’ll get kids trying to pass the ball to each other rather than lump it up to the other end of the pitch			0
' at least it ’s here			0
and the academies are getting better coaches			0
kids are learning to play			0
that ’s why we ’re seeing an emergence			0
that ’s why we ’re seeing the under - 17s and under - 20s doing better in international football			2
emergence : @entity116 has broken into the @entity1 team progress : @entity119 is beginning to show his club form for @entity1 next generation : @entity122 is among a number of talented @entity125 youngsters new look : @entity127 is a recent and exciting addition to the @entity1 set - up ' with the emergence of the @entity132 and @entity133 and the @entity134 and the @entity135 and the @entity136 – players than can actually play , and keep the ball , there ’s reason for hope			1
‘ there are n’t too many countries in the world where you ’ve three organisations running the game			0
‘ it does n’t help because they ’re all in a bit of a fight for power			0
ultimately if we can develop enough players , the balance of foreign players is n’t great , but that ’s because we ’re not producing enough players			0
‘ most clubs would actually like homegrown players because they ’re a lot cheaper			0
we could do with one or two managers giving the homegrown youngsters a chance , like @entity163 has done at @entity164			0
we need a bit more of that			0
’ @entity0 presents the @entity167 on @entity34 7pm sunday looking to the future : @entity164 manager @entity163 has given young players a chance in his team			1

@entity3 will *contest* the @entity6 final against @entity8 on sunday
