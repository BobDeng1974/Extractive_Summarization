by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 maintains @entity3 must not take it for granted they will sweep aside the challenge of @entity6 at the @entity7 next week to secure their place in the @entity10 group stages			1
the @entity11 battled to a goalless draw in the play - off first - leg at the cauldron of the @entity15 in @entity16 , where midfielder @entity17 was sent off late on for a second yellow card and so will miss the return match back in @entity20 next week			1
@entity6 manager @entity21 insists his well - organised side - who hit the bar right from kick - off through former @entity27 striker @entity26 - are very much still in contention , although it remains to be seen if the former @entity30 and @entity31 defender will be allowed in the dugout having been ordered to the stands late on by @entity35 referee @entity34			1
defiant : @entity2 maintains that @entity3 will next take @entity6 for granted in the second leg tussle : the @entity11 played out a gritty goalless draw in the @entity40 captail on tuesday night @entity2 knows @entity3 will have to be on their guard to qualify through to the group stages for what would be a 17th consecutive @entity45 campaign			1
' it was a hostile atmosphere , but i think we battled well and showed a different side to our game , especially at the end when we went down to 10 men , it was tough , so we did well , ' @entity2 said			1
' they worked just as hard as we did last year to get themselves into this position , so they are not going to just turn up ( at the @entity7 ) and throw all of that hard work away ' it is not going to be an easy game and we ca n't take it for granted			1
' they are going to come full of confidence from their performance in the first game and we are going to have to start how they did and take the game to them			0
' @entity2 added : ' we always want to be in the @entity10 and to attract players who can be in the @entity10			2
' we know how big a game it is , and we will treat it as a cup final			0
' threat : @entity26 proved a threat up front for @entity6 all night at the @entity78 embrace : the former @entity27 forward had been linked with a move to @entity3 last season @entity3 hit the woodwork themselves late on when substitute @entity84 's angled drive was turned against the far post by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity86			1
despite the loss of key man @entity17 - who netted a stoppage - time winner to beat @entity89 on the opening day of the new @entity91 season - the @entity11 will be boosted by the return of @entity95 @entity94 winning trio @entity93 , @entity96 and @entity97 , who could all feature for saturday 's trip to @entity31			1
@entity20 midfielder @entity2 said : ' having won the @entity94 can have an impact , but the @entity95 have got a fantastic mentality anyway			2
' last year , you saw that - they are great characters to have in the dressing room			0
' we are looking forward to getting them back and it is going to make our squad even stronger			0
' @entity84 also feels there are plenty of reasons for @entity3 , who beat @entity114 to win the @entity115 at @entity116 , to be positive			2
livewire : @entity84 had an excellent cameo off the bench in the latter stages passionate : @entity21 got in trouble with the referee and was sent to the stands ' it is early in the season and you could argue not everyone is at their peak fitness yet , understandably , but that will come soon and we will get better from here , ' he said			2
' the technical side of our game will improve			0
i am confident of that , but the togetherness and the will to win is definitely there			0
' that is our basis to start from and then the technical side needs to come after , so we will push on from here			0
' the important thing now is to switch our concentration to @entity31 away at the weekend , which will be a tough game and then we think about the @entity10 again next week			0
' as well as deciding if @entity21 - who apologised immediately after the game - must serve a suspension , @entity151 will see if there is a case to answer against the @entity40 club , their home @entity150 currently being redeveloped , after @entity157 reported an object being thrown at him as he walked off the pitch			1
@entity3 will , meanwhile , assess the fitness of captain @entity161			2
the midfielder left the stadium in a protective boot around a twisted ankle and so could miss the return to his old club			0
@entity169 red card unbelievable - @entity157			0
