by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:39 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 1 november 2013 devastated : @entity2 has been denied @entity3 on the @entity4 after years of trying to have children a woman who dreamed of starting a family was refused ivf on the @entity4 – because her fiance already has children			1
@entity2 , 32 , was left devastated after being told that the health service would not fund the fertility treatment			1
miss @entity2 first tried to get pregnant when she was in her early 20s , but doctors told her that she would not be able to conceive naturally due to problems with her fallopian tubes			1
two years ago she met her partner @entity14 , and after getting engaged last summer the pair decided to apply for treatment so they could start a family			2
mr @entity14 , who works as a glazier , has two children – @entity21 , nine , and eight - year - old @entity22 from a previous relationship – so the couple can not be classified as childless			1
and during their first appointment at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , a nurse told them this meant they were not eligible for @entity4 - funded ivf			1
the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) recommends that women aged 23 to 39 with fertility problems should be entitled to three cycles of @entity3			2
however prospective parents can find themselves at the mercy of regional variations , as local @entity4 clinical commissioning groups have the final say on who should be allowed treatment and how many cycles will be paid for			2
miss @entity2 said : ‘ i ’m having the right of being a mother snatched away from me and it is devastating			1
every woman should have that right			0
couple : ms @entity2 was denied treatment because fiancé @entity14 , right , already has children blocked : bosses at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 made the decision guidelines published by the @entity34 suggest that all women under 40 should have access to free ivf			1
they should be referred for treatment after two years of trying to get pregnant , according to the guidelines - but if , like ms @entity2 , they can only have a baby through @entity3 , they can start treatment straight away			1
however , the guidelines are only voluntary , and hospitals are free to impose their own @entity67 a bid to save money , many local @entity4 trusts will only fund @entity3 for women who do not have children already			1
while it is possible to undergo private @entity3 treatment , each course costs around £ 5,000 , making it unaffordable for many would - be mothers			2
‘ i have people deciding my future that have never met me or know my situation			0
they are playing @entity83 with my life			0
’ she added : ‘ becoming a mother means everything to me			0
i feel it is my purpose of being here			0
’ @entity89 , from @entity90 , @entity30 , has now launched an appeal against the decision			2
she said : ‘ i know there are no guarantees that it will work but if i can at least try then that would help me			0
my future is being played out in the hands of doctors and it ’s not fair			0
’ and she explained how the refusal had put pressure on the couple ’s relationship , adding : ‘ @entity103 broke down himself when he came home and i ’m depressed with the whole thing			0
‘ @entity103 thinks it ’s his fault because he has kids and is upset that he ca n’t give me what i want			0
but he ca n’t be blamed			0
‘ it is very much that i am being punished for being with the man that i love			0
’ @entity111 , associate chief nurse at the @entity28 , said : ‘ we treat each @entity3 case on an individual basis , but we have to be mindful of the rules surrounding treatment in order to be fair to everyone			1
