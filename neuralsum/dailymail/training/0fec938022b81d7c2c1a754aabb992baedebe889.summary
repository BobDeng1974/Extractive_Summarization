by @entity0 children across the @entity3 are increasingly being targeted by mobile phone thieves , new figures have revealed			1
@entity5 is the worst affected area , where 10,000 phones are stolen every month , with two thirds of victims aged between 13 and 16			1
the rise in popularity of high value smartphones , which thieves can easily resell for cash , is a major contributory factor in these shocking figures			2
the rise of young children using smartphones such as the @entity19 , has led to a rise in mobile phone thefts as robbers can resell the expensive devices easily more than 170 iphones are stolen every day in @entity5 , but as the figures , obtained from the @entity27 by @entity28 , show it is a problem affecting the whole country			1
in @entity31 more than 40 per cent of mobile phone thefts were from people under 21 , and in @entity34 the figure is 35 per cent			0
in @entity37 32 per cent of the victims of mobile phone theft were under 20 , and the figure for the same age group in @entity40 is 28 per cent			1
the figures also show that children as young as six have been victims of this crime			1
@entity44 reported one case where a three - year - old was the victim , the old mobile phone had been given to the child as a toy			1
one area of advice to parents wanting their children to have a mobile phone is to give your child a model that is slightly older or less desirable to thieves police have been stationed outside some schools to help reduce the number of thefts , with other schools even taking the precaution of providing self - defence classes to keep their pupils safe in the event of a robbery			1
in @entity71 mobile phone theft affecting 10 to 15 - year - olds increased 40 per cent last year and in @entity74 thefts from 16 to 20 - year - olds have risen by 30 per cent in the last three years			1
@entity76 , professor of criminology at the @entity78 told the @entity28 : ' no one below the age of 10 carried phones around 10 years ago			2
now it 's a common occurrence			0
' parents give their children a mobile phone because they feel it will make them safe , but ironically it can lead to increasingly victimisation			2
' criminals only steal items that are desirable and that they can sell , and kids are easy targets			0
perhaps it would be best to give them a phone that is not the top of the range			0
' the police are struggling to get to grips with the problem because of the sheer number of cases they are faced with			0
in many instances the crime is n't even reported to the police by victims			2
between 2009 and 2011 , @entity44 had 11,027 cases of mobile phone theft			0
in only five cases were charges brought , and figures also revealed only 77 offenders were cautioned for the offence in that period			0
