by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 17:35 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:21 est , 26 december 2013 the first thing you notice as @entity6 rides the tricyle she found under the christmas tree is the sheer delight on her face			2
it ’s only at second glance that her battle to do the things other children take for granted becomes apparent			2
@entity17 , five , beat incredible odds to survive meningitis almost three years ago			1
after her ordeal there was no way she could ride the bike her parents , @entity39 and @entity40 , had bought for her around the time she became ill. only a month before she was rushed to hospital , the schoolgirl had fallen in love with a bike and @entity39 , 32 , and @entity40 , 32 , had secretly bought it , hoping to surprise their oldest daughter on christmas day			1
full - time mum @entity39 , who is now separated from @entity40 , said : ‘ @entity17 had never had a proper bike of her own before she became ill. ‘ but she ’d fallen in love with cycling after being given a little tricycle by her cousin			1
she used to spend hours on it , pedalling for miles and miles			0
strong support : after £ 400 was raised through a fund to help her through life after the 2011 operation , @entity17 is able to ride her very own first bike , specially made to her measurements , that works with her new prosthetic legs ‘ before @entity26 we took her on a shopping trip and she set her heart on a little bike she spotted in one of the shops			1
it was lovely – blue with yellow flowers and bees on it			0
‘ as soon as she got on it she was zooming off all over the shop			0
she loved it so much we could n’t get her to leave			0
in the end we had to carry her out kicking and screaming			0
‘ @entity40 and i bought it secretly and could n’t wait to give it to her			0
we were probably more excited than her that year			0
‘ but we did n’t get the chance because @entity17 was rushed to hospital and she did n’t come out again until january			1
’ @entity17 had been a normal , healthy two - year - old before meningococcal septicaemia struck			2
two weeks before christmas day 2011 , @entity39 discovered the purple marks associated with the infection on @entity17 ’s chest and she was rushed to nearby @entity90			1
within hours , the little girl suffered multiple - organ failure and doctors were fighting to save her life			0
as the infection spread , @entity17 developed gangrene from septicaemia and medics were forced to amputate her limbs in january 2011			1
@entity39 said : ‘ it ’s hard to recall everything that happened because i was in shock			0
it was like i was on another planet			0
‘ one thing that i do remember doing is going to pick up @entity17 ’s bike from the shop and taking it to the hospital on christmas day			1
@entity108 : @entity6 opening her @entity26 tricycle last week at home in @entity111 start of a dream : @entity6 riding a tricycle during @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 ‘ we got permission from the doctors to put it by her bed in intensive care			1
‘ @entity17 was barely conscious and was n’t really aware it was there - it was more for us			2
we wanted to see her with her present			0
’ @entity17 left hospital in january and , since then , she has shown incredible courage adapting to life as a quadruple amputee			2
but she has never been able ride the bike she had fallen in love with that @entity26 three years ago			1
@entity39 said : ‘ @entity17 tried desperately hard to ride the bike			1
she would spend an hour just trying to cycle three metres			0
‘ it was incredibly difficult for her – no matter how much effort she put in , she struggled to turn the pedals with her prosthetic legs			1
‘ it was one of her biggest frustrations , but she was determined			0
she added : ‘ in the years since , she has asked for a bike every @entity26 and every birthday			1
it ’s the only thing she really wanted			0
‘ we looked everywhere and @entity17 tried out so many bikes but nothing seemed to work			2
there was almost a point when i did feel like we ’d have to give up			0
’ after years of searching , @entity17 ’s dreams were finally answered this august when the family attended @entity114 in @entity115 and @entity17 ’s eyes fell on three - wheeled bike , made by @entity153			1
@entity39 said : “ the last thing we looked at was the bike area , which was run by @entity156			2
support : @entity17 's mother @entity39 , 32 , was able to give her daughter the ' trike ' thanks to her fund “ they were packing up for the day but we asked if @entity17 could have a go on a three - wheeler that she had spotted			2
“ the next thing you know , she ’s on the bike and she ’s cycling up and down like there ’s no tomorrow			2
“ it was absolutely incredible			0
we ’d waited so long but we ’d finally found a bike that was the right fit for @entity17			1
” after doing some research online , @entity39 discovered a @entity153 stockist close to her home			0
using £ 400 raised through @entity17 ’s trust fund , she was able to buy a three - wheeler that was custom made to her daughter ’s measurements			1
incredibly , she even managed to convince @entity153 to break with tradition and make the bike pink – @entity17 ’s favourite colour			1
the design was completed just in time to be wrapped and placed under the tree for @entity26			2
and today @entity17 ca n’t hide her delight as she zooms along the cycle path close to her home , turning the pedals with her brand new sparkly silver legs , which were also made just in time for @entity26 by @entity188			1
@entity39 said : “ @entity17 has waited so long and she ’s been so patient so it was so incredible to be able to finally give her her first bike this @entity26			1
“ the look on her face when she ’s riding it is just pure delight			0
it ’s so heart - warming to see			0
“ it really has cheered us all up too			0
it shows how far we ’ve all come since that day in december three years ago			0
“ everyone remembers getting their first bike but i think @entity17 will really treasure this moment for the rest of her life			1
