@entity1 chairman @entity0 was accused of being ' disingenuous ' after claiming @entity3 's failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium made it impossible to accept the @entity11 - based businessman 's offer of investment in the troubled @entity14 club			1
a proposal from @entity3 's group was considered last month along with another from @entity19 owner @entity18 before the @entity14 board finally accepted a £ 2million interest - free bailout from existing shareholder @entity22			1
the @entity24 owner subsequently increased that amount by a further £ 1m , with the total loan amount secured against the @entity31 club 's @entity28 and @entity29 car park properties			1
@entity0 has been accused of being ' disingenuous ' after saying he could n't accept @entity3 's money rangers in action against @entity35 at @entity14 on saturday - a match they drew 1 - 1 in a rare interview on tuesday , @entity0 spoke publicly for the first time on why the club had turned down former @entity14 director @entity3 , who was also looking for 51 per cent of @entity1 shares in return for his consortium 's £ 16m investment			1
but the @entity14 chairman – who claimed that he could not tell shareholders ' hand on heart that these guys have got the money ' - provoked a furious response from @entity3 's consortium			1
they claimed proof of funds was available ' immediately ' but that @entity56 , chairman of the @entity1 football board , had agreed that the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed			1
' we had three people offering us funds , ' said @entity0			2
' and i felt it was very important we do proper due diligence on all three			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity68 ( centre ) takes a shot on goal from long range @entity3 's ( left ) money was not accepted by @entity1 ' chairman @entity0 , but @entity22 's ( right ) was ' in the past , @entity1 has perhaps done deals it would n't have if it had done proper due diligence			1
' where ( the @entity3 offer ) fell down was really at stage one			2
when i said to all three of these people : " would you show me proof of funds ? " , two showed me proof of funds			2
' the second question for the consortium was : ' i know there are eight of you , i only know three of you			0
can i please have the other five names ? ' and the message i was getting all the time was : ' if you agree to do deal , if you persuade 75 per cent of shareholders , then we 'll show you funds and you can have the other names '			0
' it was n't meeting the due diligence requirements			0
the simple questions were : ' show me the money ' and ' give me the names '			0
' i can not go to the shareholders with a deal where i do n't know all of the names and i ca n't check ( those ) names out			0
i ca n't go to the shareholders and say with my hand on my heart that these guys have got the money			0
' with the other two people i could			0
we went round the houses and in the end we moved on to stage two with two providers ( @entity22 and @entity18 )			2
' @entity0 pictured arriving at @entity14 for a @entity1 match earlier this year sports direct billionaire @entity22 , who controls just under nine per cent of @entity1 , also runs the club 's retail arm			1
but when he gave the club a further £ 1m earlier this month he relinquished the rights to rename @entity14 that he had purchased for just £ 1 from former @entity1 chief executive @entity125			2
@entity0 insisted @entity22 's security demands on the car park and @entity28 were less onerous than what was on the table from @entity18			1
he added that @entity22 's loans being interest - free , coupled with the @entity24 owner 's commercial interest in seeing @entity1 thrive , represented the best deal for the club			1
' it was a simple question of which provider was offering the lowest interest rate and @entity22 was offering zero interest rate , which was difficult to beat , ' said @entity0			1
' and ( it was about ) which provider wanted the least security			0
again , @entity22 wanted @entity28 and the car park , but it was a small amount of security relative to the other deal			2
once we got to that stage , it was a no - brainer which one we were going with			0
' also i think @entity22 had the advantage because we have an important joint - venture with him , with the merchandising agreement , which is important to us			2
we make quite a lot of money from it			0
he and we are both keen that @entity1 has financial stability because we will both benefit			2
' while tuesday was the first time @entity0 had gone public to explain in detail why the @entity3 and @entity18 deals were turned down , his comments echoed an earlier statement @entity1 issued to the stock exchange on november 12			1
on tuesday night , however , @entity3 said @entity0 was ' being disingenuous with his comments '			1
in a statement , the businessman added : ' we had private discussions with both ( former chief executive ) @entity166 and @entity56 in which we told them that we would immediately provide proof of funding and details of the full make - up of the consortium following confirmation from @entity56 that the shareholders whom he represents were prepared to support the terms of our investment proposal in principle			1
' @entity56 agreed to proceed on this basis			0
unfortunately , he was not then able to provide the confirmation we asked for			0
there was no possibility of proceeding any further without the support of @entity56 's group who had the power to block our proposed investment			0
' @entity18 was not available for comment on tuesday night .			0

@entity3 offered investment to @entity1 when they were in dire need of it
chairman @entity0 turned it down because @entity3 could not provide proof of funds and identify consortium members
instead , @entity1 accepted a £ 2 million interest - free bailout from @entity24 owner @entity22
now , @entity0 has been accused of being ' disingenuous '
