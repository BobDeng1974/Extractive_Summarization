it seems like hipsters are here to stay with the bearded , kale - munching , green juice - drinking members of society creating their own non-conforming offspring			0
as hipsters breed , it is only fitting that they choose ironic names , inspired by music , art , geographical locations and nature – or sometimes just random letters of the alphabet			2
when @entity14 announced to the world that her children were named ‘ @entity18 ’ and ‘ @entity19 ’ the names were considered abnormal			2
but the kindergarten classes of 2020 are likely to be filled with children with monikers inspired by fruit			0
they ’re the names that make you feel like you have n’t applied nearly enough wit or innovation in the naming of your own children			2
@entity33 - twirling , kale juice - drinking hipsters seem to be taking over the baby name game here is a list of the names that are most likely to be attached to the cardigan - wearing , thrift - store shopping bubs			1
@entity40 , according to @entity39 , has frequently been used as a name by celebrities , shared by the sons of both @entity44 and @entity45			1
one would think that the prominence of the name amongst celebrities would make it strictly off bounds amongst hipsters			0
despite this , it is indeed a favourite name amongst the glasses - wearing , bike - pedalling members of society – especially if it is the ‘ spirit animal ’ of the parent			0
often , the secret to a hipster name is taking a name that is intended for one gender and giving it to a child that is of the other sex			2
embracing all things vintage is an important component when naming a hipster child			2
for girls , names like @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are climbing the hipster charts			1
there are bouncing baby boys boasting the names @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
but remember – these names can not hit the top 100 baby names			1
as soon as they do , they are no longer original , thus can not be used for a truly hipster baby			1
should we named it @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 or @entity75 ? @entity81 ? @entity82 ? @entity83 ? he 'll probably ride a fixie and work as a barista names normally used for objects , with @entity96 and @entity97 frequently used for little girls			0
plant and food names are also particularly popular , such as @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
amazingly , @entity106 is even more multipurpose than first thought			1
it is not just a hipster superfood , used frequently in salads and juices , but is also understood to be a boy ’s name names that appear to be nicknames , such as @entity116 , @entity117 are also markers of true hipster names			1
for hipsters naming their babies it is an opportunity to demonstrated just how cultured and well - read they are			0
classic novels are the birthplace of many hipster names			1
of course , the books that are used can not be mainstream favourites , but rather the long - forgotten treasures			0
the beloved 1960 novel ‘ @entity134 ’ by @entity135 has inspired two of the favourite names amongst the hipster community : @entity136 and @entity137			1
@entity138 is another hipster pick , naturally spurred from the 1726 text ‘ @entity141			0
@entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 are among the literary - inspired hipster name choices @entity143 and @entity144 are two names that should be expected in future schoolyards , both derived from ‘ @entity147 ’ – @entity143 being a character in the novel and sallnger the surname of the author , @entity144			1
if the name begins with an x , q or z it is preferable , as they are highly uncommon – which remember , is the goal when naming a hipster child			0
these names include @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 many of the character names from @entity166 are becoming popular are they now hold a certain irony – so expect to see more people bearing the names @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			1
just because hipsters are becoming parents , does n’t mean they ’re not cool			0
to remind the world of this fact , many children ’s names have been inspired by the names of old - school rock stars			0
the name @entity183 is having a resurgence , as is @entity185 – a la @entity186			0
@entity187 is a nod to @entity189 and @entity190 is used for both baby boys and girls , perhaps in reference to the @entity190			0
naming children after geographic locations is a special way for hipsters to commemorate memories - with good times obviously frequently occuring at places such as @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 , which are increasing in popularity			1
considering the number of hipster 's residing in @entity208 however , one can expect @entity209 or @entity210 to soon be inked on baby certificates			2
some names channel the kind of personality the parents want for their child			0
some hipster parents are optimistic , choosing names like @entity219			2
others are more daring , gifting their future ratbag with the name rebel or @entity223 .			0
