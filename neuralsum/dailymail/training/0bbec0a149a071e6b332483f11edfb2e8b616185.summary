i am really happy – i would have loved to get the gold , but you ca n't have everything			2
' @entity21 said : ' i do n't even know how to react , i was in shock			1
when you look up at the results , there is no feeling to describe it			0
' the drama of their rivalry has spanned the 11 - day duration of the @entity7			1
two days before the @entity43 , @entity21 was left distraught after being kicked out of the @entity44 for not being impaired enough by her disability			1
however , she was reinstated on appeal just in time to allow her to do battle with @entity1 for the first time in the 400m freestyle last saturday			1
then , the @entity5 heroine seized the lead in the final few metres to win the ' race of the @entity44 ' , leaving the feisty @entity56 ' growling with anger '			1
but @entity21 yesterday extracted sweet revenge by defeating @entity1 to take gold in the 100m freestyle			1
ever since @entity1 's first golden performance , television figures for the @entity7 have gone through the roof			1

@entity1 , who has a form of short - limbed dwarfism , was already the subject of adulation after winning two golds in @entity92 as an irrepressible 13 - year - old but the courage of her performances at these @entity44 took it to a different level			1
