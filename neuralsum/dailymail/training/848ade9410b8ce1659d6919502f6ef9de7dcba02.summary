by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 3 september 2013 a father who feared his little girl would never hear him say ‘ i love you ’ has hailed the miracle treatment which has allowed her to hear for the first time			1
when @entity8 was born 22 months ago , doctors noticed something was wrong with her hearing and specialist tests revealed she was severely to profoundly deaf			1
her father @entity13 , 34 , and mother @entity12 , 29 , struggled to deal with the news @entity15 may never hear , but threw themselves into trying to help her			1
@entity8 , 22 - months , was born severely to profoundly deaf but can now hear after being fitted with a cochlear implant			1
she is pictured with her brother @entity18 , four , and her parents , @entity13 and @entity12 the couple , from @entity21 , @entity22 , have now seen @entity15 come on leaps and bounds after she was fitted with a cochlear implant , which means she can hear and interpret sounds			1
last december , when @entity15 was just 13 - months - old , she had an operation to fit the implant			1
the following month it was ‘ switched on ’			0
since then , there has been no stopping @entity15 , who can say ‘ dada ’ , ‘ mama ’ and ‘ look ’			1
accountant mr @entity33 said : ‘ when we were told @entity15 was deaf , it was very emotional and upsetting			1
‘ i remember thinking , “ she will never hear me say i love you ”			2
‘ when she was four - weeks - old she went through three hours of tests at @entity40 , @entity22 , where they confirmed she was severely to profoundly deaf			1
since the implant was fitted , @entity15 has learned to say ' mama ' , ' dada ' and ' look '			1
her parents say that she has come on in leaps and bounds since being able to hear ‘ but we realised there was all kinds of support available from the @entity52 and @entity40			2
‘ we were referred to the cochlear implant unit at @entity54 in @entity55 , were @entity15 was assessed for suitability to be fitted with implants			1
’ doctors gave @entity15 the thumbs - up for implants but , in the end , they could operate only on her right side because a previous illness had left her with a calcium build - up under the skin around her left ear			2
however , even one implant is having a huge effect on the lively girl			2
mr @entity33 said : ‘ every time we hear a new word it is emotional and wonderful			1
@entity15 ( pictured with her brother , @entity18 ) was found to be deaf when she was just four - weeks - old			1
her father , @entity13 , says he feared she would never hear him say ' i love you ' ‘ when i come home from work at night i wait at the front door and shout “ @entity15 ” and my wee superstar comes running out for a hug			1
‘ we can also take her swimming and she can keep her implant on rather than taking it off because they have developed a thing called an aqua kit to keep the device safe			2
‘ we are so proud of @entity15			0
she has been through a lot in the first 22 months of her life but she is always smiling and is a happy wee person			2
’ the @entity52 has arranged weekends for parents of young deaf children and @entity15 ’s parents say they have learned a great deal from speaking with others in similar positions			2
a cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound			1
it will not cure deafness , but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing			0
the sooner a child receives the implant , the less therapy will be needed to help him or her learn speech			0
the device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours			0
it involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear			0
the devices receives sound , processes it , and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve			0
the currents activate the nerve , which sends a signal to the brain , which the person comes to learn as hearing			0
in the @entity136 , around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received the implants			0
mr @entity33 is so impressed with the charity ’s work , that he is running the @entity141 half marathon on september 15 to raise funds for the @entity52			0
he has never run long distance before , but has been training for the big day			0
he said : ‘ i felt i wanted to thank them for all the support they have given us over the past 22 months			2
‘ i want to make @entity15 as proud of me as we are of her			0
i am hoping to raise £ 1,000 and anything else is a bonus			0
’ mr @entity33 said : ' when i come home from work at night i wait at the front door and shout " @entity15 " and my wee superstar comes running out for a hug ' mr @entity33 is running the @entity141 half marathon on september 15 to raise funds for the @entity52 @entity15 ’s older brother @entity18 , four , is also enjoying being able to communicate with his sister			0
he even understands when she has not got the implant activated and asks his parents to turn it on			0
and the family is set for a new arrival because @entity12 is expecting her third baby , due to be born in eight weeks			0
