by @entity0 published : 07:44 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 31 may 2012 baby wipes are as safe and effective as cotton wool and water and can even soothe nappy rash , according to scientists			1
a wipe is as gentle on baby skin as the cotton wool and water washing technique recommended by @entity11 health experts , it is claimed			1
researchers at @entity13 tested the wipe against cotton wool and water on 280 babies over a three - year period			1
the high street wipe tested is as gentle on baby skin as the cotton wool and water washing technique recommended by @entity11 health experts they discovered that wipes are ‘ as effective and as safe as water - but much more convenient for parents '			1
and babies cleaned with wipes suffer less nappy rash			0
the findings run contrary to guidelines from the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , which recommends that parents wash newborns with cotton wool and water to avoid skin irritation			1
babies under the age one lose more moisture through their skin than older children and are more vulnerable to irritation , meaning parents have to use gentler washing techniques			2
lead researcher @entity38 said ' the wipes were ‘ equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration '			2
they also revealed slightly lower levels of maternal - reported napkin dermatitis - or nappy rash - among babies washed with wipes than those who had water and cotton wool used on them			2
professor @entity38 said : ' our trial provides us with the strongest evidence available so far that we should n’t base our practice on tradition alone and that @entity27 needs to look at its current guidelines			0
' for the first time , we now have a robust , adequately - powered study that can be used in practice , the results of which should be adopted by our national guidelines			0
' these results should provide healthcare professionals with much needed evidence - based information , giving them the option to support the skin - care cleansing regime best suited to individual parents and their newborn babies			0
' the experiment was sponsored by wipe manufacturer @entity72 using their @entity73			0
but professor @entity38 said the research was carried out under ‘ strict , independent scientific protocols ’ , using blind tests and peer reviews			0
she added : ' our research , looking at one high street baby wipe , wanted to test whether the product was as safe and effective on newborn babies ’ skins as water alone to see if midwives could help give parents more options than current guidelines provide			1
' parents can now be confident that using this specific baby wipe , proven in the largest randomised clinical trial conducted in newborn cleansing , is equivalent to water alone			2
' the research was published in the journal @entity94 .			0

researchers tested one high street wipe against cotton wool and water on 280 babies over three years
they are now calling on @entity27 to *change* the *advice* it gives parents
