‘ it is ironic that on the one hand @entity6 doctors are being criticised and on the other hand they are being courted			2
’ @entity51 , chief executive of the @entity9 , added : ‘ we are here to protect the public and make sure that doctors who treat patients are safe to do so , regardless of where they have received their training			0
‘ these figures demonstrate that we will take action where doctors fall short of the standards we expect			0
‘ international medical graduates make a huge contribution to healthcare in the @entity3 and the vast majority of them provide excellent care for their patients			0
‘ however , we know that doctors coming here from overseas can find it difficult to adapt to different cultural norms and it is certainly true that in the past not enough was done to support them when they first came to practise in this country			0
‘ more is now being done – we ourselves run a “ welcome to @entity3 practice ” programme and all doctors coming here are now part of national system of regular checks			2
‘ we have also commissioned a major review of how we assess their knowledge and skills when they apply to join the @entity3 register – the review will report later this year			0
