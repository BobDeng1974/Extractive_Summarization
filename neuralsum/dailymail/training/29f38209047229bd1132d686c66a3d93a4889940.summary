by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:06 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 23 january 2013 tribunal : @entity2 was ' guilty of worse conduct ' than the male workers she accused of harassment a 39 - year - old female it worker who claimed she had to endure an ' offensive and sexualised culture ' in the office has had her case dismissed at an employment tribunal			0
@entity2 took her ex-employer @entity12 , in @entity14 , to @entity15 for sexual harassment and breach of equal pay laws			1
mrs @entity2 said she was told ' not to be too sensitive and just get on with it ' when she complained to the @entity12			1
but her formal grievance was rejected with bosses finding that what she considered to be ' sexually explicit attention and rumours ' was no more than ' banter '			0
she resigned in march last year and made a claim with the employment tribunal that she had been bombarded with lewd jokes , sexual invitations and talk of a sexual nature			0
she accused one colleague of making remarks about his vasectomy and ejaculation and another of demanding that she made the coffee			0
the @entity12 strenuously denied her claims throughout and insisted that she was a willing participant in a culture of banter			1
during the tribunal proceedings it was revealed that mrs @entity2 had sent emails making sexual comments and including images of semi-naked men and women in sexual poses to the male colleagues she alleged were guilty of sexually harassing her			0
mrs @entity2 insisted she had stopped sending such emails by august 2009			0
the married mother - of - three withdrew her claims on november 19 and the @entity12 applied for costs			1
in a separate , costs order hearing , employment judge mr @entity55 found that her claim of sexual harassment was ' untenable because she herself was a willing participant and clearly led and encouraged such conduct '			2
it added : ' indeed she was guilty of similar and worse conduct			0
' it was ruled at the costs hearing that this evidence , once disclosed to her , made her continued pursuit of sexual harassment allegations ' unreasonable ' , concluding she was ' guilty of similar and worse conduct			2
' hearings : mrs @entity2 must pay former employer @entity12 40 per cent towards their legal costs it was also ruled her complaint of indirect sex discrimination had ' no foundation			1
' her allegation of unequal pay was also judged to be ' misconceived ' and based upon a ' wholly unrealistic ' job evaluation review conducted by herself , which , if accepted , would have moved her from being the most junior member of the it team to being its director			2
mrs @entity2 was ordered to pay 40 per cent of her former employer 's overall costs which were yet to be assessed .			1
