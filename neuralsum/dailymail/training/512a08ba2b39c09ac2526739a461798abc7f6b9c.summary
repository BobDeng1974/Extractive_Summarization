by @entity0 for the @entity1 the call came while i was sitting in my daughter ’s @entity5 study			1
i ’m delighted to tell you that you ’ve been selected to appear on @entity10 , ’ said the producer			2
‘ we ’ll be in touch soon to finalise dates and your specialist subjects			2
’ my stomach turned over with a familiar pang — half - excitement , half - terror at the thought of my fourth appearance on the cult show			1
why do i keep putting myself through this ? it must be the dangerous thrill of that @entity10 theme tune , the black leather chair , the blinding spotlights that induce brain ‑ numbing panic and @entity30 , trying unsuccessfully to sound avuncular			2
‘ and is your daughter , @entity32 , there ? ’ asked the voice			1
‘ i need to speak to her , too			2
’ @entity32 , 21 , listened intently for a second and then squealed in delight and hugged me			1
mastermind had always been a cult show in our house and now she had got the call , too — one of the youngest ever contestants , one of just a handful of female quizzers and part of the first ever ‘ family double ’ of mother and daughter competing in the same season			1
days earlier she had been gutted to miss out on @entity52			2
she and her brother , @entity53 , were each picked for their college teams , @entity32 captaining @entity56 ’s , @entity5 , and @entity53 , 22 , reserve for @entity58 , @entity59			1
but neither appeared in the televised version as the colleges were whittled down to just a handful of uber - geeks			2
as a @entity65 sports presenter , i had worked alongside @entity66 in the @entity67			1
during the @entity52 qualifier , he joked with my children that he chiefly remembered me for mangling the word ‘ dioceses ’			2
i resisted the temptation to tell them what i chiefly remembered him for ! both had always loved quizzes and , aged ten , @entity53 even reached the final of @entity80 ’s @entity79 , presented by a young @entity81			1
‘ she ’s very pretty ’ he confided afterwards , ‘ but she could n’t even pronounce @entity83 ! ’ @entity32 ’s alma mater , @entity84 in @entity85 , has a strong quiz tradition			1
aged 13 , she was in the @entity88 side that reached the national finals			2
maybe it ’s in the genes			1
during childbirth , i deadened the pain of contractions with an epidural and played @entity96 with my husband , @entity97 , for hours			2
he now claims he let me win			2
as if ! over the years i ’ve appeared on @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and a host of pub quizzes and charity events			0
during a lucrative outing , aged 18 , on @entity106 , which paid for several weeks of tennis tournaments , i became flustered when asked to spell ‘ pseudonym ’ and blurted out : ‘ p - s - u - e - d			0
no , that ’s not it			1
p - s - u - e - d			0
oh , bugger it ! ’ @entity111 , with ineffable condescension ( and the answer on a card in front of him ) intoned : ‘ @entity118 , when you get to @entity5 , take a dictionary and you will see that it ’s spelt p - s - e - u - d - o - n - y - m. ’ mastermind , however , remains the single most nerve - wracking experience of my life			1
quizzing is fractionally more male - dominated and gladiatorial than professional rugby league and populated by anoraks with halitosis and low - level jobs , maybe because they spend every spare minute hoovering up obscure facts in order to clean up at pub quizzes			0
any woman who admits to the same perverse taste for memorising trivia , from @entity137 state capitals to @entity139 board squares , in order , is treated with pitying contempt — or , if she wins , outright aggression			0
drawn by a curious masochism , i first entered @entity10 in 2009 and squeaked through the first round — specialist subject : @entity147 ’s short stories — narrowly beating three ( delightful and supportive ) blokes with immaculate personal hygiene , only to find a hostile taunt on my @entity152 entry			1
‘ despite being “ a so - called sports journalist ” , she failed to recall that @entity153 captained @entity154 in the 2007 @entity155			1
@entity156 ! ’ i bowed out in the semi ‑ final to the eventual ( female ) winner			0
never imagining i would get through the first round , i had thoughtlessly picked tennis star and feminist campaigner @entity160 as my specialist subject , a horribly broad topic as her career lasted several decades			0
why had n’t i chosen @entity168 who won her first three wimbledons in the @entity171 then retired , aged 18 , after smashing her leg in a riding accident ? this time — for an episode to be aired tomorrow — i chose @entity174 ’s poetry ( it ’s entertaining and easily memorable ) , and selected a sparkly frock but manageable heels : the polished mastermind walkway is narrow and slippery			1
@entity32 and i tested each other to distraction , memorising lists of @entity80 prime ministers , flags of the world , @entity188 winners and @entity186 capitals			1
we arrived at the @entity191 studios — she excited , me numb with terror			0
of course , nothing we ’d memorised cropped up in the all - important general knowledge questions — though @entity174 ’s ‘ usual suspects ’ miss @entity195 and @entity196 the ‘ great big mountainous sports girl ’ were there			1
and how did we do ? you 'll just have to tune in to find out			0
@entity202 ’s @entity201 says : i ’ve wanted to go on @entity52 for as long as i can remember			1
so when my college team failed to make it past the heats , i was naturally disappointed			0
sensing mediocrity , my ever - pushy mother nagged until i agreed to fill out an application to go on @entity10 — the @entity209 to @entity52 ’s @entity210			1
some parents seem determined their children will go to a particular school or become a rocket scientist , but in our family it ’s all about quizzes			1
she even entered herself , presumably for moral support			0
@entity118 and @entity32 will both be seen on our tv screens soon in the infamous @entity10 chair i was invited to @entity223 for an interview and to answer a few general knowledge questions			1
i assumed it was a lost cause , thanks to the football question i ’d undoubtedly got wrong ( pretty sure @entity229 do n’t play at @entity230 ) , and i kicked myself for forgetting the word ‘ quango ’ under pressure			1
still , no doubt the @entity65 had gender diversity quotas to fill — i got on to the show			1
sadly , the top two possible specialist topics i ’d hoped to do , @entity236 and @entity237 , had been chosen in recent years , which was a huge disappointment			0
as a child , i read and re-read the @entity236 books while the other children went to birthday parties			0
as for @entity237 , i just wanted an excuse to revisit @entity245 in a wet t - shirt			0
in the end , i opted for the novels of @entity249 and spent weeks mugging up , though i kept avoiding his longest , most complicated work , a passage to @entity253			1
i then had to read and learn the entire book the day before filming			0
on the day itself , i opted for a loose , white polka - dot shirt and jeans			0
@entity258 nagged me to wear something smarter , but i was dressing for comfort			0
my grandma and best friend , @entity262 , came along for support and tested us both as we drove to the @entity65 studios in @entity266			2
we were fitted with microphones and herded into the main studio , which was awash with cameramen , lighting technicians and spectators			0
when @entity30 appeared , the lights dimmed and the quizzing began			0
watching other contestants before me was the worst bit			2
i was so nervous when the guy in front of me finished that i started walking to the chair before my name was called			0
cue laughter from @entity30 and the audience , and an embarrassing re-take			0
on my way back , the mic fell out of my jeans , and had to be refitted in front of everyone			0
but when i got in the chair , something marvellous happened			0
i found that the mic incident , while mortifying , had released a lot of tension , and i felt almost relaxed			0
both sets of questions went surprisingly well			0
the other contestants answered on @entity295 , the band @entity296 and @entity297 ( the tv show , not the beginning of the universe )			1
i got lucky with what felt like the easiest general knowledge questions , but still managed to give an unbelievably thick answer to a question about jewellery			2
when we finished , @entity30 strode off before i got a chance to speak to ( i.e. take a selfie with ) him			0
will i get another opportunity ? that ’s one question i ca n’t answer just yet ... @entity0 will appear on mastermind on @entity313 tomorrow at 8pm ; @entity32 ’s appearance is on friday , february 6 , at 8pm .			1

they are the mother and daughter *duo* who will both be *victim* to @entity321 **'s** question on the popular quiz
@entity32 will be one of the show **'s** youngest ever contestants and her mum , @entity118 , is a seasoned *veteran* in the quiz arena
former sports journalist , @entity118 , will be tested on @entity174 ’s poetry
@entity332 student , @entity32 , will be taking on the novels of @entity249
