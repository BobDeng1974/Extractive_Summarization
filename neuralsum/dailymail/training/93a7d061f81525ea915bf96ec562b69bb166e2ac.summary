concern : the report reveals how the number of cases of diabetes being treated in the @entity5 has more than doubled in the last 20 years one adult in ten has diabetes in some areas of the country , a report reveals today			1
the number of cases being diagnosed has more than doubled in the last 20 years , largely due to rising obesity			1
the borough of @entity15 in @entity16 has the highest rate , with 10.5 per cent of adults known to have diabetes , the figures show			1
in @entity21 , @entity20 , 9.9 per cent of adults are sufferers , with 9.6 per cent in @entity23 and 9.4 per cent in @entity24 , @entity16			2
in @entity25 , @entity26 , the rate is 9.4 per cent and in @entity27 it is 9.3 per cent			2
the report by @entity29 predicts that by 2020 , 1 in 12 children will have diabetes			1
presently 7.4 per cent of under - 16s are diagnosed , but this is set to rise to 8.4 per cent			2
there are 2.9million adults and children with diabetes in the @entity5			1
of those , 90 per cent have type 2 , which is usually triggered by obesity			2
the charity estimates at least another 850,000 people have the condition but do not yet know it			2
many of the worst - hit areas have large @entity47 populations			1
this group – which includes those from @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 – is six times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes			2
scientists believe this is partly down to a genetic difference that means their muscles do not burn fat well			0
traditional cooking methods using oil , creamed coconut milk and a high - fat butter called ghee may also play a role			0
@entity67 , chief executive of @entity29 , said : ‘ it is truly alarming that there is now somewhere in @entity70 where more than one in ten of the people have diabetes			1
‘ given that the increase in cases is mainly due to a sharp rise in type 2 diabetes , the only way we will finally bring the increase under control is by getting much better at preventing cases of type 2			0
growing problem : the steady increase of diabetes sufferers has been linked to rising obesity rates ‘ a vital first step is to ensure that people realise how serious it is and understand their own personal risk so if they are at high risk they can make the simple lifestyle changes that can help prevent it			1
‘ if people are overweight , have a large waist or are over 40 , they need to get a risk assessment , as should people who have a family history of diabetes or are @entity47 and over 25			1
’ the charity urged adults at high risk to speak to their gp or pharmacist for advice			0
diabetes occurs when the body can not break sugar down into energy			0
this happens when the hormone insulin does not work properly or the body does not make enough of it			0
symptoms include thirst , tiredness , weight loss and constantly needing to go to the toilet			0
there is no cure , but it can be treated by tablets , insulin injections or , for mild type 2 , by a change of diet			0
they 're seen as a naughty treat for a sweet tooth , but @entity129 glazed doughnuts , at 7g of sugar each , look saintly next to some ‘ healthier ’ offerings , researchers say			0
a large @entity134 red berry fruit cooler drink has almost 14 times more sugar , at 97.1g – or 24 teaspoons			1
a large @entity138 coffee @entity136 – without whipped cream – has 61.6g of sugar , as much as nine doughnuts			1
