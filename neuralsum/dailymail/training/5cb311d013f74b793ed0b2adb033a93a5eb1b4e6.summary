despite being a hugely successful businesswoman , mrs @entity2 's regret is not becoming the @entity20 manager ‘ i did n’t find getting back on the ladder [ after motherhood ] hard , ’ she said			1
‘ for any female to do well in business you have to ignore the fact that you are female			2
' you have got to earn your place based on your own qualities and abilities			0
’ and her approach certainly seems to work			0
in september , she was ranked as number ten in @entity111 ’s hottest rising business stars , putting her alongside success stories such as @entity115 boss @entity114 and @entity117 founder @entity116 , and making her the highest ranked @entity118			0
