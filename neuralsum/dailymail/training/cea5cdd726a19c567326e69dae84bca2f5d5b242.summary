they say it ai n’t over till the fat lady sings , but calling an opera singer ‘ dumpy ’ , ‘ stocky ’ and a ‘ chubby bundle of puppy fat ’ is a different matter — as male critics who commented on rising star @entity6 ’s appearance are discovering			1
fellow opera singers have accused them of sexism while music websites have been swamped with messages of support for 27 - year - old miss @entity6			1
the row erupted after the mezzo - soprano performed for the first time at the @entity19 in the comic opera @entity20			1
@entity42 of the @entity43 said miss @entity6 is ‘ dumpy of stature and			1
her costuming makes her resemble something between @entity47 and @entity48 ’			2
the @entity49 described her as ‘ unbelievable , unsightly and unappealing ’			0
the classical music website @entity51 hit back saying : ‘ @entity6 may carry slightly more heft than a size eight , but what has that to do with performance ? ‘ does excess body weight affect artistic performance on stage ? obviously not , as @entity60 loudly demonstrated			1
’ @entity61 , a leading mezzo - soprano , said : ‘ we can not people our operatic stages with singers that above all are believable visually or sexually attractive to our critics — that way lies the death of opera			1
opera is all about the voice			2
’ a spokesman for @entity74 - born miss @entity6 said : ‘ @entity6 is focused on the music and preparing for her upcoming performances			1
there will be no further statement at this time			0
’ however , her parents , who live near @entity80 and went to the opening night at @entity82 on saturday , voiced their distress at the row to the @entity85			1
‘ @entity6 is concentrating on her work and not getting involved in the debate , ’ said her mother @entity86 , 50			1
‘ so , we are not saying anything , even though there ’s lots i would like to say			0
she has a show tonight and just needs to concentrate on that			0
‘ @entity6 has such inner strength			1
she takes the view that what ’s said is said , it ’s out there now , and it would be much worse if they were criticising her singing rather than her body			0
‘ she is getting tremendous support from everyone around her			0
she is a professional and is just getting on with it			0
‘ we ’ve never had to face this before			0
she ’s been reviewed in a lot of places and there ’s never been an issue like this before			0
’ miss @entity6 ’s father @entity111 , 63 , added : ‘ i am so , so proud of my beautiful daughter			1
you have to meet her to know you are living with an angel			0
all of us — her family and people around here — are so proud of her			0
she is a young woman of substance and i ’m delighted to be able to say that about my lovely girl			0
‘ i saw her performance in @entity20 and she was fantastic			1
she got a standing ovation — what more could you ask for ? she could n’t have done any better			0
‘ i would n’t like to comment on the people who made the remarks about her			0
she ’s a sensible girl — it wo n’t affect her too much			0
’ @entity6 began singing lessons at school when she was ten , but it was a family holiday to @entity129 that set her on the path to becoming an internationally acclaimed opera singer			1
‘ we went to @entity134 and experienced a stunning production of [ @entity137 ’s ] @entity136 , a life - changing experience and my first - ever live opera performance , ’ she said in a recent interview			1
‘ i already knew that i loved to sing , but this opera experience was a new firework that interested me beyond belief			2
and that was it : i had decided ! ’ after opera singing lessons , she went on to study at the @entity144 in @entity145 and then joined the @entity147 company			2
she was catapulted to world - wide acclaim three years ago when she replaced an ailing colleague in the role of @entity151 with just five days ’ notice to learn the part			1
one @entity155 reviewer said at the time : ‘ they call it a breakthrough when a star is born			0
@entity6 creates moments of wonder			1
’ she has won several prestigious awards , toured the @entity164 and made her @entity166 recital debut at the @entity167 in april			0
fellow opera singers have joined the protest at the @entity82 reviews and have spoken out in support of the young singer			1
to watch video in full click here ' @entity175 ' : the criticism of ms @entity6 has been characterised as fat - shaming mezzo - soprano @entity177 said : ‘ how have we arrived at a point where opera is no longer about singing but about the physique and looks of the singers ? clearly overt sexism is still rife			1
’ and bass baritone @entity185 has published a hard - hitting open letter to @entity6			1
‘ the hideous , immature , low - life trash that we saw hurled in the name of music criticism could have landed on anyone , ’ he said			2
‘ i am so deeply angry it happened to a radiant , beautiful performer bubbling with talent and technique			0
‘ you have taken a bullet , but it will not be in vain			0
you have taken that bullet for all of us , and it is our responsibility to make change in our world			0
‘ we singers have all been nagged or bullied about our bodies , though usually in private , and it has done nothing but harm to us and to the artform			2
‘ it is my hope that this has not only exposed certain critics as perverted schoolboys with no imagination , but that it has also exposed everything that has gone wrong in the opera world over the last generation or so			2
‘ i believe this critic debacle and the backlash has been a catalyst to usher in a new era where singing and artistry matter most , once again			0
it is long overdue ! ’ yesterday , @entity43 critic mr @entity42 said he is ‘ distressed to learn that miss @entity6 has been upset by the hoo - ha ’ , but said he stands by every word he wrote			1
he defended his review , saying he felt she had been cast ‘ against type ’ in a ‘ principal boy ’ role			0
he added that miss @entity6 is ‘ a very pretty girl with a delightful smile and endearing stage presence ’			1
yes , it ’s true that the @entity74 soprano @entity6 is never going to win @entity237 , or even miss @entity80 , any time soon			1
but then none of the shockingly ungallant critics who have described her as fat is a candidate for mr @entity243			2
their complaint is that her role is unconvincing because she lacks the gamin , androgynous qualities of a principal boy			0
it is true that she suffers by comparison with her lover , sung by @entity254 , who is lissom and appears stark naked at the opening of the work			2
even so , miss @entity6 sings fabulously , which is all that matters to some of the more old - fashioned of us			1
she may not look remotely masculine , or have heart - throb qualities , but if you ca n’t suspend disbelief , you should n’t go to the opera			1
what ’s more , i ’ve seen much fatter singers — including one playing @entity270 ’s great character @entity271 , who was nearly the size of @entity273			2
@entity20 is a comedy — not quite a @entity274 , but not far off			2
as such , miss @entity6 should ignore her critics			2
a great future in opera awaits her , whatever they say			2
ms @entity6 , from @entity80 , @entity74 , graduated from the @entity144 in @entity145 and has been a member of the opera studio at the @entity147 in @entity281 since 2008			1
in summer 2010 she joined internationally celebrated @entity283 pianist @entity282 for the @entity284 from the canals of @entity286 and made her debut at the @entity19			0

in march of 2010 she was awarded the @entity299 's @entity298 in @entity145			2
she has also won the @entity300 for the @entity301			0
her professional debut came last year when , aged 26 , she sand @entity303 at the @entity304 , and has performed in many acclaimed roles since .			0

@entity6 , 27 , is playing a lead part at the @entity308
ms @entity6 plays @entity20 in @entity310 's @entity20
but reviews of her opening night performance focused on her physique
she was called ' dumpy ' and ' a chubby bundle of puppy - fat '
other opera singers have come to the defence of ms @entity6
