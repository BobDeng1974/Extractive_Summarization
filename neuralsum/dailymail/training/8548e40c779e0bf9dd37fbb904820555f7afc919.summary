clueless actress turned @entity3 contributor @entity1 issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at @entity8 that many saw as unabashed victim blaming			1
the controversy started after an appearance on @entity13 , when the outspoken conservative said the school 's recent ban on sorority members attending frat events was unfair to ' good girls ' when it 's the ' bad girls -- bad women -- or the ones who like to be naughty , [ who ] might go out and play and get hurt			1
' ' but the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks			0
it 's the same thing with guns			0
guns do n't kill people ; people kill people , ' she continued			0
apologized : clueless actress turned @entity3 contributor @entity1 issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at @entity8 that many saw as unabashed victim blaming critics quickly pounced and said the 48 - year - old 's comments excused sexual assaults on ' bad girls ' who choose to drink alcohol			1
and on monday , @entity47 responded by clarifying what she meant via a @entity51 post in which she called her ' naughty girl ' comments ' a failed attempt at humor			2
' dash continued : ' @entity57 : i am a victim of physical and sexual abuse			2
my point was that there is no excuse for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances			2
' i believe that these universities focusing on alcohol consumption as a means to stop evil behavior takes the focus off the real issue of the objectification of women and how that can be prevented			0
dash apologized via @entity51 , where she called herself a victim of assault ' i apologize to anyone who believed i was blaming the victims of these horrible acts			1
' while the response was enough to quiet most critics , at least one found the apology offensive in its own right			0
in her article titled ' look , @entity1 , we thought you were @entity89 ' , @entity90 of @entity91 wrote : ' if @entity47 had said that the ban was " ridiculous " because it disempowers women , that would have been a more solid argument			0
instead , in some sort of conservative - talk - show sleight of hand , she used the misguided ban to attack the character of " naughty " girls who get hurt when they " go out and play			1
" ' dash implied that ' naughty girls ' who go out and drink are somehow to blame for sexual assault			1
