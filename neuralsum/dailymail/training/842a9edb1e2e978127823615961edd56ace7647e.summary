by @entity0 so , here we are again			0
you may recognise it well , for it is just as we were last week			0
another moment of respite , another blanket over the flames engulfing @entity9			2
once more , the green shoots of recovery spring up and the lonely occasion creates a world of possibilities in the mind of @entity16			0
it was all there again for the @entity20 manager on saturday lunchtime			0
as insipid and anaemic as his side were against @entity24 and @entity25 , so they were incisive and cavalier here against @entity27			2
as the precocious teen @entity29 decorated this @entity20 victory with a glorious assist for @entity31 late on , it almost felt an illusion that the talk of this past week had been that @entity16 could be approaching the end game as @entity35 arrive at @entity9 on tuesday evening			1
@entity43 scored his first goal in a red jersey , @entity42 finally provided some indication as to what all the fuss is about and @entity50 was immense yet again , looking every inch the @entity20 captain - in - waiting			2
at this moment in time , @entity50 is @entity20			0
@entity20 without @entity50 would be like @entity53 without @entity54			0
@entity50 has rediscovered his love for the game , charging around , all muscle and deftness			0
at times , it seems he is on a personal mission to keep his manager on - board			0
unfortunately , though , it is not on the basis of games at home to @entity27 that @entity16 will be judged			1
handsome victories over the lesser lights are taken as red in these parts , par for the course , one to tick off the list in the pursuit of grander occasions			0
deadly : @entity50 scored a double as @entity20 beat @entity27 4 - 1 at @entity9 on saturday at the very least , this was an afternoon of relief for @entity16			1
this result stills some of the squalls around him and provided a timely riposte to the crass aeroplane stunt that undermined the vast majority of @entity20 supporters who have , for the most part , been generous in their backing of @entity16 this season			1
@entity89 , however , is devoured extraordinarily quickly in football these days and with the words ' @entity93 out ' emblazoned in red letters across the @entity9 skyline , this became a day of some significance for the @entity20 manager			1
there have been times this season when it has seemed as though @entity20 have turned so many corners that they have gone full circle and saturday marked another of those ' is this the day it all changes ? ' junctures for the imperilled @entity20 manager			0
up in the air : a plane flew over @entity9 displaying an @entity110 banner during the match the problem for @entity20 under @entity16 is that their hot streaks last only until the next challenging fixture			1
the month of march has offered a fitting snapshot of @entity20 's curious season			1
a 3 - 0 win at @entity118 was followed by a 3 - 0 defeat at home to @entity24			2
optimism was garnered by victories over @entity123 and @entity124 but the air swiftly went out of the balloon with the midweek capitulation against @entity25			0
saturday yielded another of these rosier days but the next dose of reality is expected when @entity35 arrive at @entity9 and there is little reason to expect that this fluctuating script will deviate any time soon			1
support : @entity16 received a hug from a @entity20 supporter as he arrived in the dugout ahead of the match following @entity20 under @entity16 has become a life of extremes and too often the air of renewal has proved deceptive			1
the @entity16 ' @entity143 ' is starting to become a weekly occurrence in these parts			0
in , out , they shake him all about			0
for now , the rank - and - file have settled down and while the @entity148 wonder privately - and my , how they do - there was no voluble mutiny on this occasion			0
winning helps , of course			0
from plane spotting to plain - sailing , this was a day of appeasement but these @entity20 supporters have seen enough false starts this season to be taken in by a victory over @entity27			1
in truth , @entity163 's side , just like @entity123 ten days earlier , were generous opponents for a side teetering on the brink			0
@entity16 will be only too aware that radical improvement is required if @entity20 are to challenge @entity35 in the @entity169			1
@entity20 's record in the defining matches this season has been appalling			1
in 13 matches against sides in the top nine of the @entity176 , @entity20 have won just one			1
tough test : @entity179 champions @entity35 are @entity20 's next opponents on tuesday @entity181 € ™ warning to @entity183 's all - conquering team that â € ˜ @entity9 is not an easy place to comeâ € ™ is rather undermined by a home record that is equal to @entity186 and only one point better off than those of @entity189 and @entity190			1
the statistics are jaw - dropping			0
@entity20 have failed to win nine of their sixteen @entity176 assignments at @entity9			1
@entity194 , @entity25 , @entity24 , @entity195 and @entity196 have all kept clean sheets at @entity9 and four of those teams won without reply			2
a cursory glance at the teams @entity20 have beaten in the @entity176 this season only hastens the conclusion that @entity20 are little more than flat - track bullies : @entity206 , @entity190 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity27 , @entity124 , @entity189 , @entity186 , @entity211 and @entity118			1
struggles : @entity16 looked dejected as his side crashed to a 3 - 0 defeat at home to @entity25 on tuesday this @entity20 squad may be packed with serial winners but their manager appears to suffer from a conviction deficit disorder in the biggest games			1
the major holes in his cv are yet to be patched up			0
it is now 49 @entity176 away games as the opposing manager at @entity194 , @entity24 , @entity210 and @entity20 that @entity16 has failed to win a football match			1
there has been an apathy in these season - defining matches that goes against all we expect from a @entity20 team			2
not only has the swagger disappeared but so too has that obstinacy , that refusal to wither , that rejection of defeat			0
@entity20 have fallen behind on sixteen occasions this season and only four times have they recovered to win			2
watching on : former manager sir @entity240 watches @entity20 beat @entity27 from the stands at @entity9 against @entity35 , @entity20 must recover their old identity , stop playing chess and as the ditty goes , excite the fans with ' football taught by @entity247 '			1
@entity16 ' side must shed their inhibitions and display the kind of character and nerve that is considered mandatory by those who come through the turnstiles			2
@entity16 talks wistfully of the plans he is busy formulating for the long - term at @entity9 but he will know deep down that football is also about the here and now , the next 90 minutes			1
there may be a masterplan in place behind - the - scenes but for the time being , the supporters require one of those magical nights at @entity9 to escape the despondency and to reconnect , however briefly , with the fluency and majesty of the @entity240 years			2
tuesday against @entity35 would be a fine time to shine			2
message : the @entity272 banner continues to hang at the @entity273 despite @entity16 ' recent woes			0

one win in 13 against the top nine sides
all very well beating @entity27 but a @entity20 can never be judged on a victory over a *mid-table* side
@entity16 says ' @entity9 is not an easy place to come ' - @entity20 's home record equal to @entity186 and @entity196 - failed to win nine of 16
@entity20 take on @entity35 in the @entity169 *quarter* - finals on tuesday
