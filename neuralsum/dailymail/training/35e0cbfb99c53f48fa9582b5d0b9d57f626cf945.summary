after two years of popping up at high - profile events sporting @entity3 , the gadget that transforms eyeglasses into spy - movie worthy technology , @entity1 co-founder @entity0 sauntered bare - faced into a @entity7 red - carpet event on sunday			1
he 'd left his pair in the car , @entity0 told a reporter			1
however , it has emerged that the consumer version , which @entity1 promised would go on sale this year , has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future			1
since they were unveiled , he has rarely been seen without them			1
the @entity23 , who heads up the top - secret lab which developed @entity3 , has hardly given up on the product - he recently wore his pair to the beach			1
but @entity0 's timing is not propitious , coming as many developers and early @entity3 users are losing interest in the much - hyped , $ 1,500 test version of the product : a camera , processor and stamp - sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames			1
@entity1 itself has pushed back the @entity3 roll out to the mass market			1
while @entity3 may find some specialized , even lucrative , uses in the workplace , its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim , many developers say			1
of 16 @entity3 app makers contacted by @entity48 , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them , mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device			1
three more have switched to developing for business , leaving behind consumer projects			1
however , plenty of larger developers remain with @entity3			2
the nearly 100 apps on the official web site include @entity62 and @entity63 , although one major player recently defected : @entity65			2
@entity1 founder @entity0 ( @entity66 ) and designer @entity67 sit and watch the rehearsal for her @entity70 collection show during @entity71 , where new @entity3 frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing			1
@entity3 was the first project to emerge from @entity1 's x division , the secretive group tasked with developing ' moonshot'products such as self - driving cars			2
glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology , as smartphones once were , that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers			1
' if there was 200 million @entity3 sold , it would be a different perspective , ' said @entity91 , the chief executive of @entity93 , which put development of a @entity3 game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms , including the @entity62 - owned virtual - reality goggles @entity100			2
' there 's no market at this point , ' several key @entity1 employees instrumental to developing @entity3 have left the company in the last six months , including lead developer @entity106 , electrical engineering chief @entity107 , and @entity108 , director of developer relations			1
and a glass funding consortium created by @entity112 and two of @entity7 's biggest venture capitalists , @entity109 and @entity110 , quietly deleted its website , routing users to the main @entity3 site			1
@entity1 insists it is committed to @entity3 , with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it , as well as new fashionista boss @entity121 , a former @entity122 executive			2
' we are completely energized and as energized as ever about the opportunity that wearables and @entity3 in particular represent , ' said @entity126 of business operations @entity127			2
' we are as committed as ever to a consumer launch			2
' that is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it 's absolutely ready , ' @entity127 said			2
@entity1 has created several designer frames in a bid to make @entity3 more attractive @entity0 had predicted a launch this year , but 2015 is now the most likely date , a person familiar with the matter said			1
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity3 have been building			2
some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors and , at times , @entity1 itself			0
the @entity148 , the funding consortium co-run by @entity112 , invested in only three or four small start - ups by the beginning of this year , a person familiar with the statistics said			0
a @entity112 spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of investments and said the web site was closed for simplicity			0
' we just found it 's easier for entrepreneurs to come to us directly , ' she said			0
@entity1 dubbed the first set of several thousand @entity3 users as ' explorers			1
' but as the @entity161 hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes			0
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ' @entity171			0
' ' it looks super nerdy , ' said @entity173 , a @entity174 - based consultant , whose @entity3 now gathers dust in a drawer			0
' i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many			0
' @entity3 now sells on @entity181 for as little as half list price			1
the lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that @entity1 still treats @entity3 as an experiment			0
' it 's not a big enough platform to play on seriously , ' said @entity190 , founder of @entity192 - based software firm @entity191 , which put on hold a @entity3 app for logging exercise and biking			0
mobile game company @entity196 , known for its popular ' @entity197 : @entity199 ' title , was one of the first to launch a game on @entity3			0
@entity204 , a puzzler released a year ago , is still available , but @entity196 has discontinued work on it , a spokesman for the company said			0
another developer , @entity208 , won $ 10,000 in a contest last year for creating an aliens - themed video game for @entity3 , @entity212 , but @entity1 never put it on the official hub for glass apps , making it tougher to find			1
he has quit working on updates			0
still , there are some enthusiastic developers			0
cycling and running app @entity220 finds @entity3 well - suited for its users , who want real - time data on their workouts , said @entity226 , vice president of business development			0
and entrepreneur @entity227 said it is ideal for his company , @entity229 , which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel			0
in april , @entity1 launched the @entity233 program to help make the device useful for specific industries , such as healthcare and manufacturing			0
so far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as @entity241 and @entity243 ' @entity242			0
@entity1 is selling @entity3 in bulk to some businesses , offering two - for - one discounts .			0
