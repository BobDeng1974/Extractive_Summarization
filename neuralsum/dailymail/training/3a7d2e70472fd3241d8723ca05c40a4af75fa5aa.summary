' evaluating @entity29 's claims was difficult , ' given his mental health issues , his possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual , " bipolar " friendship with @entity28 , ' the report said			1
' nonetheless , we ultimately concluded that @entity29 was indeed harassed by @entity28 , who can fairly be described as the main instigator			1
' the report comes about three months after the league hired @entity22 to investigate the case , which prompted a national debate about hazing and workplace bullying			2
' to a great extent , @entity28 dictated the culture , ' the report said			2
' we doubt that matters would have gotten so out of hand had @entity28 not set a tone on the offensive line that made extremely vulgar taunting a typical form of communication			2

@entity29 has said he tried to be friends with @entity28			1
the two players traded more than a thousand text messages in a year 's span , and the teasing and vulgar banter went both ways			0
@entity29 also participated in the teasing of @entity121 , although investigators say he was simply trying to fit in with the other linemen			2
the report also mentioned @entity29 having suicidal thoughts			2
' whether or not @entity28 , @entity24 and @entity25 fully appreciated the effect of their actions on @entity29 , there is no doubt that , from @entity29 's perspective , their actions were abusive and hurtful , ' the report said			1
