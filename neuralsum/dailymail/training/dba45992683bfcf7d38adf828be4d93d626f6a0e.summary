by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 8 june 2013 with just £ 1,000 in the bank and one part - time employee , the @entity2 is hardly in a position to threaten the global dominance of the world ’s biggest drinks producer			1
but @entity9 , the powerful @entity10 corporation which numbers @entity11 among its brands , apparently thinks otherwise			1
lawyers acting on its behalf have written to the group of parents who run @entity19 demanding that they drop the name or else face court action which could bankrupt them with legal fees			1
the @entity10 giant claims that customers could confuse @entity19 ’s ales and its own fruit - flavoured @entity28 beer			1
@entity9 , which produces @entity31 beers , pictured left , has threatened a @entity34 microbrewery called @entity2 , pictured right , with legal action unless it changes it name the heavy - handed intervention has shocked the fledgling @entity40 business , which is named after the popular state school attended by the children of @entity19 ’s two directors – real ale fans @entity44 and @entity46			1
potential investors are also required to have a child at @entity49 in @entity34 , @entity50 , to ensure the small - scale enterprise retains its community links			0
mr @entity44 , 50 , said : ‘ the legal threat is ludicrous because the products are completely different			0
‘ @entity28 is a @entity56 fruit - flavoured beer with a tart taste			1
our beer is made with @entity10 yeast and hops and is more like a pale ale			1
none of the shops and pubs we supply are more than a few miles away			0
’ however , @entity9 – which last year generated revenue of nearly $ 40billion ( £ 26 billion ) – has made the extraordinary claim that consumers could confuse the two			1
shocked : five of the founding members of the @entity2 , pictured from left to right are @entity44 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , were stunned by the heavy - handed intervention a warning letter , drafted by @entity40 lawyers hired by the @entity78 - based company to protect its @entity40 commercial interests , says : ‘ visually and aurally , @entity31 and @entity19 share the first six letters in common and end with the same letter “ e ”			1
‘ conceptually , both @entity28 and @entity19 would be understood by the @entity83 - speaking consumer as signifying something beautiful			2
‘ as a result of this considerable degree of similarity			0
your use [ of the name ] is bound to lead to deception and confusion among the public and our clients ’ consumers and potential customers			0
‘ such use also enables you to take unfair advantage of , or free ride on , our clients ’ reputation in the @entity101			0
’ the letter , from @entity104 law firm @entity103 , demands the destruction of all packaging and promotional material bearing the microbrewery ’s name and the removal of any references to @entity19 on the company ’s website within 28 days			2
lawyers for @entity9 claims the name @entity19 could easily be confused with @entity28 beers by @entity83 - speaking consumers @entity9 claimed the level of similarity between the names would lead to deception and confusion mr @entity44 , a musician who played guitar and keyboards with @entity126 creator @entity125 in the 1990s – said his first instinct was to defy the threat of a @entity131 injunction			1
but after consulting colleagues , he decided a more prudent course would be to choose another name			0
one option under consideration is @entity137 , the name of a road in @entity34			0
mr @entity44 started home - brewing in his kitchen and offered his ale for the first time at a beer festival organised by the parent - teacher association at @entity19			2
his nine - year - old son , @entity146 , attends the school and elder son @entity148 , now 11 , is a former pupil			2
mr @entity44 added : ‘ there is only one member of @entity19 staff – me – and i do n’t draw a salary			0
‘ the legal action must have been triggered when we registered the name			0
we feel coerced and bullied			0
it ’s as if they ’re saying , “ we have more money than you , so you ’ve got to do as we say			0
” a @entity40 spokesman for @entity9 , whose chief executive @entity162 last year received a £ 2.7 million bonus , said : ‘ we are unable to comment on ongoing legal matters			2
’ no relation : @entity166 in @entity50 is entirely separate from the @entity28 brand of beer simple idea : two directors of the @entity171 suggested the name @entity19 after the popular school their children attened in @entity34			1

@entity10 corporation @entity9 produces fruit - flavoured @entity28 beer
it claims customers may confuse its own beer with those made by @entity19
@entity19 **'s** two directors named their ale after their children **'s** popular school
@entity40 firm has just £ 1,000 in the bank and court action could bankrupt them
