@entity1 's advisers can try to conclude negotiations for a new contract at @entity4 , as he seeks to reignite hopes of an @entity7 recall , after agreeing his @entity9 release			1
@entity1 was axed by @entity7 in february 2014 after their ashes whitewash defeat in @entity12 , but is hoping for a still unlikely international return			1
he confirmed , on his website kevinpietersen.com , that he has taken another key step to that end by sealing his release from the majority of his @entity9 contract with the @entity20			1
@entity1 will have nine @entity22 matches at the most to impress @entity7 's selectors he 's secured a released from @entity20 to stake his claim for an @entity7 return in the ashes @entity1 said : ' my focus is now very much on the upcoming season in @entity7 , and i 'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible			1
' @entity4 de-registered @entity1 at the end of last season			2
they have nonetheless long been front - runners to re-sign him , but had no update on tuesday to the situation as of a week ago when a spokesman said : ' we are still in discussions			0
' @entity1 's availability for all formats , as soon as possible , has appeared a starting point for his possible return to @entity44 - and his presence at the start of the season , rather than spending six weeks at the @entity9 , is therefore a key development			2
@entity7 and @entity49 chairman @entity48 this month revived the record - breaking 34 - year - old batsman 's hopes of a return to the fold , contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body			2
but a pre-requisite from @entity48 was that @entity1 must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then , of course , start scoring runs again			0
@entity1 will miss the regular season in the @entity9 but could be summoned for the knockout stages imminent @entity4 signing @entity1 says he will ' do everything in my power to earn a recall ' with @entity7 @entity1 may still be recalled by the @entity20 for just a one - week period , should they qualify for the @entity9 knockout stages between may 19 and may 24			1
that , however , ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services			0
he added : ' i 've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent @entity7 , and i 'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set - up			0
' to once again put on that @entity7 shirt would be a privilege and an honour , but now i have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection			0
' a statement on his website spelled out @entity1 's next move - without specifying @entity4 as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an @entity7 return in time for this summer 's @entity90 rematch , beginning in july			1
@entity1 was axed by @entity7 following their 5 - 0 ashes whitewash in @entity12 last winter @entity1 in action for @entity4 in the @entity93 last summer @entity1 started the year by playing more short form cricket for @entity95 in the @entity96 it read : ' the four - time @entity90 winner , who is also @entity7 's highest ever run - scorer in all formats , will ... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the @entity7 squad for the upcoming @entity90 series			1
' @entity1 quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take @entity48 at his word , that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure , and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone			0
the controversial @entity114 - born batsman has received little encouragement yet in public remarks from other quarters - including @entity119 managing director @entity118 and national selector @entity120			0
@entity1 , however , has said he will ' do anything ' to play for @entity7 again .			0

@entity1 is set to sign with @entity4 for the @entity22

he will have nine games to impress @entity7 selectors before the ashes
