by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 1 august 2013 lounging on the studio sofa of ‘ shock jock ’ radio dj @entity2 , the pouting young woman did n’t exactly hold back on the electoral appeal of the man who , until a few days ago , was set to become @entity7 ’s next mayor			1
@entity9 observed this week that the controversial politician @entity10 was simply too distracted enjoying the company of girls like herself on the internet to do anything for the city			1
only she did n’t quite couch it in language suitable for a family newspaper			2
but she should know what she is talking about			2
in an expletive - laden interview about her online exchanges with the married father and already scandal - hit @entity26 politician , the 23 - year - old student revealed how an innocent communication on the web led to a sordid relationship			1
@entity10 ( pictured with his wife @entity30 ) has pledged to keep fighting in the mayoral race she related how @entity10 — sometimes using the pseudonym @entity9 — detailed his sexual fantasies , including sex in the shower			1
he also sent her naked pictures of himself during their six - month relationship , which began in july 2012			0
‘ he could have 12 girls talking to him [ on the net ]			0
and that would n’t be enough , ’ she observed			0
his conversations , either by phone or via the web , would start with small talk which suddenly ended as he told her to take off her clothes			2
a few minutes of torrid sex talk later , he ’d awkwardly thank her and hang up			0
when @entity50 started to cool over their unpleasant trysts last year , he would pester her with phone calls , insisting — though they had never met — he was madly in love with her			1
making @entity55 look like a monk : @entity10 could teach @entity58 ¿ s mayor a lesson or two about debauched behaviour and utter shamelessness ‘ there were times he ’d talk to me multiple times a day			1
he was like this needy girlfriend or something , ’ she laughed , before revealing to @entity2 that , yes , the rumours were true that she is considering milking her new - found fame further with a career in pornography			0
her manager — naturally , she already has one — has promised to get her some ‘ new big boobs ’			0
yesterday , a scandal that has enthralled @entity77 for days after @entity78 went public showed no signs of abating as @entity10 pledged to keep fighting in the mayoral race			1
at the same time , it emerged that his communications director had delivered a foul - mouthed diatribe — including the words ‘ slutbag ’ , ‘ t * * * ’ and ‘ c * * * ’ — at an intern who had dared to criticise the @entity10 campaign			1
classy it ai n’t , but then @entity77 have come to expect nothing less from the implausibly named @entity10 ( which is by an appalling coincidence @entity77 slang for the male organ ) , a man who makes @entity94 look like a monk			1
for the priapic @entity10 — at 48 just a year younger than @entity55 — could teach @entity58 ’s mayor a lesson or two about debauched behaviour and utter shamelessness			1
@entity7 politicians have never let infamy get in the way of a comeback , but @entity10 is testing voters to the very limit			1
as for the rest of @entity77 , it does n’t know whether to cry at the sheer awfulness of it all , or simply laugh at @entity10 ’s bare - faced cheek in refusing to give up his campaign			1
through his high - powered wife @entity30 ’s status as a top aide and confidante to @entity117 , the scandal is now threatening the course of the next presidential election			0
according to reports , the @entity121 camp believes a continuing @entity10 scandal could well damage mrs @entity117 ’s election hopes if she runs for president in 2016			1
to describe @entity10 as a repeat offender is putting it mildly			1
two years ago , he was forced to resign as a @entity77 congressman after admitting that he had been exchanging lewd photos and messages with at least six young women who followed him on @entity132			0
after days of feeble half - denials , the workaholic , brash and hugely ambitious @entity10 was forced to own up : he had indeed sent a picture of his private parts to a 21 - year - old woman in @entity138			1
@entity9 , left , has said @entity10 was too distracted enjoying the company of girls like herself on the internet to do anything for @entity7			1
the women @entity10 communicated with online turned out to included a 28 - year - old porn star calling herself @entity147 ( pictured right ) unfortunately , he also mistakenly sent it to all 45,000 of his @entity132 followers			1
( worse , his confession came only after he had spent £ 30,000 hiring a private security firm to investigate if his @entity132 account had been hacked , when he knew it had n’t			0
) the women he communicated with online turned out to include a 40 - year - old blackjack dealer from @entity157 , a 35 - year - old cheerleading coach , and a 28 - year - old porn star calling herself @entity147			2
although he had never met any of them , @entity10 said he was ‘ deeply ashamed ’ of his ‘ terrible judgment and actions ’ , which he called ‘ very dumb ’			2
others instead wondered about the judgment of his glamorous wife , after @entity10 revealed she was standing by him as they prepared to have their first child , ( now 17 months old )			1
ms @entity30 — a 37 - year - old @entity167 of @entity169 and @entity170 parents — was mrs @entity117 ’s deputy chief of staff when she was @entity77 secretary of state and is one of her longest - serving aides			0
@entity10 ’s wife , who earns a £ 165,000 salary , first met her future husband at a party convention in 2001 , and they started going out together in 2008			1
numerous sordid jokes — and worse , pictures — of ‘ @entity9 ’ would have caused less ambitious politicians to retreat under a stone and never emerge again , but @entity10 ’s ego , to say nothing of his sexual urges , were not to be kept in check for long			1
in may this year , he announced via a @entity187 video that he would be standing for @entity7 mayor , seeking to replace the billionaire businessman @entity189			2
by then , he and his wife had had their son , a ‘ sparkling wonder ’ they named @entity195			0
announcing the birth to friends by email , he gushed : ‘ did i mention his mom is amazing ? ’ that ’s one way of describing her			0
she has so far stuck by his side with a limpet - like doggedness that has split opinion among women			0
in a magazine profile , the couple portrayed themselves as the perfect happily married proud parents — he , a dutiful father who had sought counselling for his sexual proclivities , and generally learnt the error of his ways			0
but is @entity10 ’s wife guilty only of love and loyalty — perhaps of gullibility , too — or is she indulging in machiavellian scheming aimed at fostering her own political ambitions by making herself look positively saintly ? numerous sordid jokes - and worse , pictures - of ' @entity9 ' would have caused less ambitious politicians to retreat under a stone and never emerge again some commentators have already suggested she should be the one running for mayor , not @entity10			1
last week , after the latest scandal broke , ms @entity30 told a @entity231 conference : ‘ i love him , i have forgiven him , i believe in him			0
@entity10 ’s made some horrible mistakes , both before he resigned from @entity234 and after			2
but i do believe that is between us , and our marriage			0
’ and in an article for the latest edition of @entity248 , written before the latest scandal , she enthused : ‘ @entity10 has always been a smart , caring , and dedicated person , and while he ’s the same public servant who wants what ’s best for the people he represents , he is now something else — a better man			2
@entity7 will have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second chance			2
’ in may this year , @entity10 announced via a @entity187 video that he would be standing for @entity7 mayor , seeking to replace the billionaire businessman @entity189 so far it looks as if those voters have decided — and the omens are not good			1
@entity10 has slipped from front runner to fourth place in the polls among @entity259 candidates in the race			1
ominously , he says he does n’t know how many more compromising emails and pictures are out there			0
certainly , as one of the women he has been communicating with so graphically on the internet , @entity9 could n’t have done more damage this week			2
voicing sentiments even the most @entity271 voter must share , she told @entity2 : ‘ what p * * * * d me off was him on the campaign trail saying “ oh , i ’ve changed ” , and trying to act like he has this perfect marriage now and everything ’s just peachy			0
i ’m proof [ he ] has not changed			0
’ she says @entity10 ‘ lured ’ her into their online affair after she wrote to him — as a @entity259 supporter — on @entity282 to express her disappointment in his previous sexual shenanigans			1
a year later , she said , he responded on @entity282 and apologised for letting her down			0
almost at once , however , he began pursuing her			0
‘ that ’s what really got me , ’ she told @entity2			0
‘ that he ’s supposedly getting help , but in reality he ’s flirting with me			0
he talked to me more about his two cats than he did about his child or his wife			0
’ although tv cameras caught @entity10 off - guard this week looking hollow - eyed , he is struggling on			2
in a new advert yesterday on his campaign website — in which his wife did n’t appear — @entity10 vowed to keep running for mayor , because quitting ‘ is n’t the way we roll in @entity7 ’			1
with jaw - dropping nerve , he added : ‘ this is n’t about me			0
this is about helping @entity7			2
’ it ’s difficult to see those voters taking him up on his generous offer .			0
