an ingredient in red wine called resveratrol can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal 's pancreas if consumed in pregnancy , a study shows pregnant women who have the odd drink should avoid red wine , researchers suggest			1
they say that an ingredient in the wine that is normally viewed as healthy could harm their unborn child 's pancreas			1
resveratrol has been credited with having protective effects against heart disease , cancer , alzheimer 's disease and a number of other conditions			1
naturally present in red wine , red grapes and some berries , it is also available as a supplement			1
however , a study now suggests it can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal pancreas			1
the study was carried out by the @entity30 and the @entity31 at @entity32 in the @entity33			1
lead researcher on the study dr @entity36 said : ' this study has direct relevance to human health			2
' @entity15 is widely used for its recognised health benefits , and is readily available over the counter			0
' the important message in this study is that women should be very careful about what they consume while pregnant , and they should not take supplements , like @entity15 , without consulting with their doctors			2
' what might be good for the mother may not be good for the baby			0
' as part of the study , dr @entity49 and colleagues gave resveratrol supplements every day throughout pregnancy to obese macaque monkeys eating a @entity57 diet			2
a second group of obese monkeys was not given the supplement , and both were compared with lean monkeys fed a healthy diet			0
the animals were closely monitored for health complications , and blood flow through the placenta was determined by ultrasound			0
the study , which was carried out on monkeys by researchers at the @entity32 in the @entity33 , found that the consumption of resveratrol during pregnancy has ' a direct relevance to human health ' the foetuses were analysed for developmental abnormalities , and findings showed definitive evidence of pancreatic abnormalities			1
the study was published in the @entity82			0
dr @entity83 , editor - in - chief of the journal , said : ' we 've known for a long time that resveratrol is pharmacologically active , and we 're just now really beginning to understand the pros and cons of consuming high concentrations of this substance			0
' as we begin to establish a safety profile for resveratrol and other dietary supplements , findings like this should come as no surprise			0
' there are always negative side effects when you eat , drink , take or do too much of anything			0
