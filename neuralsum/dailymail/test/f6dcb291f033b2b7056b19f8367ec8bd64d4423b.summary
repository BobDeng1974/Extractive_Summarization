blogger : @entity1 is the author of @entity2 when @entity4 expat @entity3 first sent her vegetable - phobic three - year - old to school in @entity7 , she feared her daughter would starve during the day			1
the former assistant elementary school principal , who moved to @entity7 in 2009 , was shocked to find @entity10 on the menu for toddlers - dishes she was used to eating in fancy restaurants with her husband			1
but when offered the chance to sit in on her eldest daughter 's lunch breaks for one week , she witnessed tots using ' grown - up knives and forks ' and eating everything put in front of them			1
in her native @entity4 , children would sit on the floor in the gym to eat their lunch			2
they were given 20 minutes to wolf down whatever their parents had packed for them and 20 minutes to play			2
in 2009 , @entity1 and her husband made the move to @entity7 and she began working as a substitute teacher in @entity36			1
writing in her blog - @entity2 - the 34 - year - old said : ' i ’ll never forget dreading the fact that i was on lunchtime supervision because i saw that fish was on the menu that day			1
' i had been a teacher for long enough to know that there was going to be a lot of elementary school kids plugging their noses and telling me they did n’t like fish			2
this was going to be a long supervision period			0
' but those children proved her wrong - they did n't turn up their noses and even asked for seconds			2
' i was shocked because it was n't necessarily what i wanted to eat			2
' fast forward five years to 2014 , and @entity1 had her own daughter to get ready for her first day at school			1
at three years old , she enjoyed a healthy continental diet but refused to eat vegetables			1
three - course meal : @entity3 was nervous about sending her vegetable - phobic child to a school where pupils eat what they are served ' initially i think that we did give her everything , we eat very healthily as a family , ' @entity1 explained			1
' even if we wanted to give our kids fast food it does n't really exist			2
fast food for us is grabbing a baguette and a chunk of cheese			2
' she ate everything but vegetables - foie gras , saucisson , lapin ( rabbit )			1
at home i stopped offering her broccoli because i did n't like wasting food			1
' i was a little bit nervous			0
i thought " there is no way she can stay at school , she will be starving "			0
' writing in her blog , she added : ' each week i would head over to the bulletin board posted outside the school and check what they were eating for lunch			0
there was n’t a burger and fries or chicken finger to be seen on the list			0
' it all sounded so fancy			0
was @entity110 working in the kitchen ? how were they serving this to three - year - olds ? did they have a magic wand to get these kids to eat this very grown up list of food ? ' whenever i would come across the ladies that worked in the lunchroom , i would stare in disbelief as they would tell me what a good eater my daughter was			1
' were they sure they had the right kid ? because mine would barely touch a vegetable at home			0
yet , she was n’t coming home hungry , so she must have been eating something			1
' ' there ’s no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates , ' @entity1 wrote			1
' the kids are served their meal at the table , not buffet style ' when the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime , where there is a constantly changing menu of salads , seasonal vegetables , meats and fish , the mum - of - two jumped at the chance			1
' there ’s no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates , ' she wrote			0
' the kids are served their meal at the table , not buffet style			0
' this is @entity7 after all , where the gastronomic meal is protected as a @entity161 intangible world heritage item			1
there ’s no messing around when it comes to the @entity164 and eating			2
' all the kids ate what was served and there is no food brought from home			2
each day at lunch there was a three - course meal ; no exceptions			0
' the kids came into the lunchroom and sat politely using their manners , just like little adults			0
' they were always offered seconds when they were done , and not forced to eat something they did n’t like , yet always encouraged to try it			0
not liking something did n’t happened often though			0
' however , if someone did n’t like something there was n’t a fuss made , their plate was cleared and the next course was served			0
' when the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime the mum - of - two jumped at the chance the meal at the @entity164 state school costs parents just € 2.60 ( £ 1.90 ) each day			1
' i think a big part of it is that they are with their friends and they see all the other kids eating the same thing , ' she told @entity56			0
' there is no jealousy of what everyone else has			0
' i think it 's amazing and it makes me happy that my kids are going to school here			2
' since we have lived here we go out for dinner and see kids eating in restaurants			0
you do n't see them with a kids ' menu or colouring in front of them			0
' i think they learn it from when they are three years old			0
' my daughter eats a lot more and it was a good eye - opener for me to see what she will eat			1
she gets vegetables every night			0
' @entity1 , who is writing a book about life in @entity7 , added : ' my eyes have been opened and i am amazed by the what the @entity164 public school system does daily at noon			1
' monday starter : @entity237 ( grapefruit ) main : @entity239 ( roast beef with pureed potato and carrots ) dessert : @entity244 bifidus vanille ( yoghurt ) tuesday starter : @entity247 en salade ( wheat grain salad ) main : @entity249 ( @entity250 filled with cheese ) dessert : @entity253 ( @entity253 cheese and an apple ) wednesday @entity164 children only go to school for half a day on wednesday , so there is no school lunch			1
thursday starter : @entity261 ( tabbouleh ) main : @entity263 ( sauteed pork with prunes ) dessert : @entity270 et tarte aux pommes ( @entity269 cheese and apple tart ) friday starter : @entity272 ( soup ) main : courgettes à la niçoise ( courgettes ) et omelette au fromage ( cheese omelette ) dessert : @entity280 ( banana ) to read about @entity1 's life in @entity7 , visit www.canadianexpatmom.com or her @entity284 page .			1
