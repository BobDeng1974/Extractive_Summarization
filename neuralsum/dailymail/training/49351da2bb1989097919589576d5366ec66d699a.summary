@entity0 has said it is time for women ’s @entity3 finals to be extended to five sets			1
her call came after @entity7 took only 55 minutes to win her second @entity9 title on saturday after one of the finest displays ever seen in a final at the @entity13			1
but @entity14 , the @entity16 @entity15 captain , said : ‘ there is no reason why women ca n’t play best of five sets			1
when you have a big showcase like a @entity3 final , there is a case to be made for it being best of five sets			1
that 's @entity46 ’s win over @entity47 and @entity49 ’s victory over @entity50			2
the rest were all won in straight sets			0
47 % - by comparison , seven of the 15 ( 47 % ) men ’s matches from the fourth round to the final went beyond three sets			1
@entity57 spent just three hours and 43 minutes on court in her quarter - final , semi-final and final			1
@entity61 played for 10 hours and 16 minutes in his last three games			1
‘ but it probably should n’t just be best of five sets in the final — i think you would need to do it in the semi-final as well , so there is a run into it			2
‘ after watching the final on saturday when it was over so quickly , you got that sense that maybe it would have given @entity25 a little more time to settle into the match and also to see whether @entity7 could have held her level for longer			1
‘ the time is probably coming for best of five sets in semis and finals in the slams for women to be considered			1
’ @entity7 ’s 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 victory over @entity82 20 - year - old @entity25 should have been a privilege for those in attendance to witness			1
this was a player stepping up and producing her best when it mattered most , hitting 28 winners in a relentless show of power and aggression to which her opponent had no answer			0
but some spectators paying £ 124 for a @entity97 ticket may have left around an hour or so after the start feeling a little short - changed			1
in fact , at this year ’s championships — for the first time at a @entity3 since the @entity101 — all the matches in the women ’s draw from the quarter - finals onwards were completed in straight sets			1
unfortunate : @entity25 had no answers to @entity7 on @entity97 in two sets brave : @entity25 was runner - up but lasted just 55 minutes in the @entity9 women 's final respect : the pair shake hands on @entity97 after the match which ended 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 to @entity7 ( right ) the inevitable remarks about equal prize money followed on social media just moments after @entity7 had fallen to the turf on her back in celebration on saturday			1
the comments came again yesterday as some made reference to the fact that the first set of the men ’s final between @entity131 and @entity61 was only four minutes shorter than the whole of the women ’s final			1
whatever your stance on the issue , equal prize money is here to stay			0
in 2007 , @entity9 was the last of the four @entity3 to award equal pay to men and women and it will never again be anything other			1
it is worth pointing out that there is no difference in the various costs which come with travelling on the @entity147 and @entity148 tours			0
‘ this is the modern day , ’ said former @entity150 no 1 @entity149			0
‘ should we really still be debating whether women should receive equal prize money ? i do n’t even think there should be an argument about it any more			0
‘ @entity7 played an awesome final			2
even if that match had been best of five sets , she could have potentially won it in less than an hour - and - a - half			2
‘ i would have been more than happy to play best of five sets and i think the majority of the girls would , too			2
’ for all the debate about prize money , it is ironic that 24 - year - old @entity7 does not care too much for the stuff			2
debate : the female winners get the same prize money as the males , but play less time all eyes on her : @entity174 beat @entity25 in 55 minutes on @entity97 the moment : @entity7 drops her racket after hitting a superb winner on championship point at @entity179 off her feet : @entity7 's match was just four minutes longer than @entity61 and @entity131 's first set men ’s singles winner : @entity61 ( @entity185 ) runner - up : @entity131 ( @entity187 ) women ’s singles winner : @entity7 ( @entity191 ) runner - up : @entity25 ( @entity193 ) men ’s doubles winner : @entity197 ( @entity193 ) , @entity198 ( @entity199 )			1
runner - up : @entity201 ( @entity199 ) , @entity202 ( @entity199 ) women ’s doubles winner : @entity206 ( @entity207 ) , @entity208 ( @entity207 )			2
runner - up : @entity210 ( @entity211 ) , @entity212 ( @entity213 ) mixed doubles winner : @entity216 ( @entity185 ) , @entity217 ( @entity218 )			0
runner - up : @entity220 ( @entity221 ) , @entity222 ( @entity223 ) the cheque of £ 1.76million may come in handy for the house she is planning to build for her parents in the @entity228			0
but what meant more to her was winning the @entity231 , a perfect early present for her tearful dad @entity233 who celebrated his birthday yesterday			0
‘ i ’m not really interested in the money , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ it ’s not my job			0
i have a manager for that			0
i know that i can buy anything but this trophy i ca n’t buy			0
‘ my dad was coaching me until i was 16 and everything that you saw during this tournament is for him			0
he spent a lot of time with me so i think that this is the best present i can give him			0
’ @entity16 ’s @entity250 and her @entity252 partner @entity251 won the women ’s wheelchair doubles , beating @entity256 pair @entity255 and @entity257			0
the no 1 seeds secured a 2 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 victory to gain revenge for their defeat in the 2013 final			0
after winning the @entity265 and @entity264 this year , they have a chance to complete the @entity3 when the @entity101 begins on august 25			0
@entity250 said : ‘ there ’s pressure now because we ’re three - quarters of the way to a @entity3 , but i ’ll be working hard until then			2
’ winners : @entity250 of @entity16 ( left ) and @entity251 of @entity252 won @entity273 ' wheelchair doubles closing in : @entity250 says ' there 's pressure now because we 're three - quarters of the way to a @entity3 '			1

@entity0 thinks women 's @entity3 finals and semi-finals should be decided by five sets like the men 's
@entity14 says ' there 's no reason why women ca n't play best of five '
@entity7 took just 55 minutes to win her second @entity9 title over @entity25 on @entity97
the first set of the men 's final between @entity61 and @entity131 lasted 51 minutes alone
fans paying £ 124 feel short - changed by matches lasting less than an hour
