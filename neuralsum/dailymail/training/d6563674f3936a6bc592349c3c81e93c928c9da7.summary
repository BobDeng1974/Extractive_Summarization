by @entity0 spinal injury victims left paralysed have been offered new hope of walking again thanks to a breakthrough in stem cell science			2
@entity6 scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient ’s own cells for the first time			1
implanting the cells in rats , they found that the neurons caused the animals ’ nervous systems to rewire the spinal cord and brain			1
they ‘ wound the clock back ’ so that the cells became stem cells again and were able to transform into any cell in the body			0
these stem cells were turned into @entity31 were injected into the spinal cords of paralysed rats			2
in three months the neurons had made connections into the rats ’ brains and along the length of their spinal cords			1
the new nerves extended into their limbs too			0
while this marks a scientific breakthrough , the rats were unable to walk again			0
the cells used to grow the neurons were taken from a healthy 86 - year old man			0
they were converted into stem cell and then neurons			0
researchers grafted the neurons into rats with spinal cord injuries that were two weeks old			1
they quickly formed tens of thousands of connections into the animal ’s brain and along the spinal cord , according to the study published in @entity60			1
the connections extended out into the limbs of the injured rats ’ limbs and bodies – ‘ virtually the entire length of the animals ’ central nervous system ’			1
@entity70 , professor of neurosciences at the @entity72 , @entity69 said that three months later the cells grafted ‘ across long distances in the rats ' spinal cords , even extending to the brain ’ by ‘ traversing wound tissues to penetrate and connect ’			2

@entity86 fluorescent protein identifies human graft - derived nerve fibres , and red indicates host rat spinal cord white matter			2
@entity91 marks host rat grey matter lead scientist dr @entity94 of the university , said the human neurons ‘ extended through the white matter of the injury sites , frequently penetrating adjacent grey matter to form synapses with rat neurons			0
’ ‘ these findings indicate that intrinsic neuronal mechanisms readily overcome the barriers created by a spinal cord injury to extend many axons [ nerve fibres ] over very long distances , and that these capabilities persist even in neurons reprogrammed from very aged human cells			1
’ while the animals did not walk again , the experts still said they had made a breakthrough			0
and they believe that the build - up of scar tissue where the cells were implanted , could have prevented the rats from moving			0
professor @entity70 said : ‘ me and the team are now attempting to identify the most promising neural stem cell type for repairing spinal cord injuries			2
‘ we are trying to do as much as we possibly can to identify the best way of translating neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury to patients			0
’ for years the experts have been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury does not have to result in permanent dysfunction and paralysis			1
scientists are so keen to use a patient ’s own cells because they are more likely to be accepted by a person ’s own body preventing them from having to stake strong immunosuppressant drugs for life			1
for years the expert has been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury results in permanent dysfunction and paralysis			1
currently , there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons ( illustrated ) are lost , resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off currently , there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons are lost , resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off			0
professor @entity70 said : ‘ earlier work has shown that grafted stem cells reprogrammed to become neurons can , in fact , form new , functional circuits across an injury site , with the treated animals experiencing some restored ability to move affected limbs			0
’ however , he warned that further tests to find out how best to graft stem cells and cure paralysis could take ‘ months to years ’			2
he also said that experts should be cautious when conducting a human trial in the future			0
‘ the enormous outgrowth of axons [ verve fibres ] to many regions of the spinal cord and even deeply into the brain raises questions of possible harmful side effects if axons are mistargeted			0
‘ we need to learn if the new connections formed by axons are stable over time , and if implanted human neural stem cells are maturing on a human time frame – months to years – or more rapidly			1

@entity6 scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient ’s own cells
they implanted the cells in injured rats aiming to reverse paralysis
found neurons caused animals ' nervous system to rewire the spinal cord
connections extended into rats ' limbs but they could *n't* walk again
*experiment* offers hope to paralysed *people* as scientists get closer to cure
but expert warns it could be months or years before human trials
