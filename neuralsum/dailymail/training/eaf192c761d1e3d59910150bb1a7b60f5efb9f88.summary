a white @entity2 could save @entity3 from a double - dip recession , @entity1 forecasters have said			1
a huge bout of snow will skew economic activity so that we do not experience two successive quarters of negative growth - the technical definition of recession			1
a big freeze in the run up to december 31 will stop us going out to the shops but we will start buying again in the new year , it has been predicted			1
cold comfort : treasury forecasters have said that snowfall before @entity2 could stop a double - dip recession			2
here commuters travel through heavy snow on the @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25 on monday @entity2 white out ? @entity3 experienced it 's first bout of snowfall this winter this week on high ground and in parts of the north			2
here a farmer clears his gate in @entity33 , @entity34 professor @entity35 , a member of the @entity36 , said that snow will delay spending but not prevent it			1
' if you have a huge bout of heavy snow before @entity2 that will probably rule out a double - dip recession because gdp will fall in the fourth quarter and bounce back in the first quarter , ' he told the @entity44			1
but he added that a big freeze needed to come in the current quarter and not early in the new year			2
although recession may be avoided , snowfall before december 31 would merely alter spending patterns and not reinvigorate the economy			1
banks will bid against each other to obtain the 30 day loan the @entity36 has said there is a one - in - three chance of a double - dip recession			2
however , they admitted that the uncertain outlook in the single currency bloc meant its economic forecasts for @entity3 were in part based on guess work			2
the watchdog said the @entity3 outlook was ‘ extremely uncertain ’ and the government could not count on its latest predictions			2
they last week slashed its growth forecasts for 2012 from 2.5 per cent to just 0.7 per cent – throwing @entity68 ’s plans to cut the deficit into disarray			1
@entity36 chief @entity71 said the forecasts were based on the assumption that bank lending will return to more normal levels in the next two years			2
‘ but we are only too happy to admit that that is very uncertain and a guess , ’ added @entity35 , who sits on the @entity36 with mr @entity71			0
‘ banks do not trust each other very much and are extremely nervous about lending to each other , ’ said professor @entity35			0
‘ we have to make some assumptions about when this is going to end			0
basically , that is a guess			0
we do n’t have any more inside information than anybody else on that matter			0
’ it came during heated exchanges with mps on the @entity92 in the wake of last week ’s autumn statement			0
senior conservative @entity95 , chairman of the committee , said there was ‘ scepticism and caution ’ among @entity91 about the @entity36 ’s forecasting record – particularly after the sharp downgrades since march			0
‘ if you were so wrong in march how do we know you are right now ? ’ asked mp @entity102			0
‘ you do n’t , ’ replied professor @entity35			0
‘ we are talking about the future			0
no one knows the future			0
’ in an attempt to stave off a second brutal credit crunch which could tip the economy over the brink , the @entity108 yesterday offered to flood the economy with emergency funds			1
billions of pounds of loans will be made available to the banking system to tackle ‘ exceptional stresses in financial markets , ’ it said			2
a new facility of the @entity108 will offer banks 30 - day sterling liquidity on an ad hoc basis			1
this runs in line with their efforts to boost global liquidity the launch of the crisis lending facility came as the eurozone was warned that its rescue fund could be stripped of its gold - plated @entity134 credit rating – leaving it dangerously short of firepower to bailout debt ridden countries			1
lending between banks and to households and businesses threatens to dry up as the debt storm in the eurozone sparks panic around the world			0
@entity144 recently warned that a second credit crunch is underway and the @entity108 has said that @entity3 lenders face a ‘ systemic crisis ’			1
the @entity108 hopes its latest move will keep money flowing around the financial system and prevent a rerun of the credit crunch of 2007 that tipped the economy into recession			1
it came just a week after six central banks around the world – including in @entity3 , @entity157 and @entity158 – acted together to make it cheaper and easier to borrow dollars			0
pre-christmas snow : hills in @entity33 , @entity34 are covered in the white stuff on monday @entity164 , @entity3 economist at @entity165 in @entity166 , warned that if the ‘ current market tensions continue into 2012 ’ it will be a ‘ real struggle ’ for banks to raise funds			1
he said the action by central banks was ‘ positive ’ to ease short - term funding problems but ‘ will not do a lot for the longer - term issues ’			0
the cost of mortgages and business loans is already rising amid worries about borrowers being able to repay			0
a full - blown credit crunch next year would leave many households and small businesses starved of cash			1
ratings agency @entity186 ’s added to the gloom with a warning that the eurozone bailout fund has a one - in - two chance of losing its credit rating			1
it said the @entity192 depends on the creditworthiness of the single currency ’s six aaa rated countries – @entity196 , @entity197 , the @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
having said on monday night that there was a 50 - 50 chance that each of those countries would lose their top - notch ratings , @entity186 last night said the @entity192 was also vulnerable			0
leaders have so far failed to increase the size of the bailout fund from £ 378 billion to £ 860 billion and it is feared that a downgrade could effectively kill it off			2
@entity211 , chief @entity157 economist at @entity212 , said : ‘ there are already major question marks over whether it is going to raise the sort of money that is hoped			0
if it loses its aaa rating it has to pay more to raise funds and finds it more difficult			1
’ the downgrade of @entity196 would be particularly dangerous for the @entity223 as it could also call into question the @entity192 ’s permanent replacement – the @entity226			1
that would further hinder the @entity223 ’s ability to support debt - ridden countries such as @entity231 and @entity232 and shore up the single currency .			1
