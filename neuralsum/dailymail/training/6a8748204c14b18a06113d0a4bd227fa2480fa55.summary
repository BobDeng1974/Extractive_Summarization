by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 9 april 2013 hoax victim : followers of famed @entity5 pastor @entity4 were fooled into believing he had denounced @entity6 and was quitting his church in an elaborate online prank an internet message and news reports claiming that a famed televangelist was to renounce @entity6 and quit his church have been revealed as an elaborate online hoax			1
followers of pastor @entity4 were fooled into believing that the 50 - year - old preacher had lost his faith and resigned from his ministry			2
but an online statement purporting to be from mr @entity4 claiming that there is ' zero evidence " @entity6 " even exists ' and a series of fake news websites carrying reports of his resignation turned out to be the handiwork of pranksters			1
the unknown perpetrator of the hoax set up a fake blog , an identical copy of mr @entity4 's website and a false @entity34 and @entity35 account to announce the @entity4 's apparent resignation			1
the statement posted on the fake blog read : ' i have been accused of altering the " message " to fit my own doctrine and dogma			2
others have accused me of preaching " feel good @entity44 "			0
' i have also been accused of profiting greatly from my ministry , with my books and television deals			0
' many of their criticisms are legitimate			0
' what they do n't know is that deep down in my heart , for a number of years now , i have been questioning the faith , @entity44 and whether @entity56 is really my , or anyone 's , " saviour "			2
' it added : ' i believe now that the @entity60 is a fallible , flawed , highly inconsistent history book that has been altered hundreds of times			0
' there is zero evidence the @entity60 is the holy word of @entity6			0
in fact , there is zero evidence " @entity6 " even exists			0
' as well as the pseudo-website , subsequent stories appeared on bogus versions of news outlets including @entity69 , @entity70 and the @entity71			0
prank : an announcement purporting to be from the pastor appeared on a false version of his website ' lost faith ' : the false announcement claimed that there ' is zero evidence " @entity6 " even exists ' elaborate : a @entity35 video was also created to spread the false rumour that pastor @entity4 had quit a fake @entity69 banner story carried the headline : ' pastor of mega church resigns , rejects @entity56 '			1
but the false @entity34 feed has since been removed and one of the fake websites set up , @entity91 , suspended for violating the website 's terms of service			1
officials at @entity5 in @entity95 , @entity96 , where mr @entity4 has been chief pastor since 1999 , told the @entity97 that they were aware of the hoax and ' false rumour '			1
fake : as well as the hoax statement , false versions of several top news websites were created to carry the story convincing : although the @entity5 says that it is aware of the hoax and ' false rumours ' , no one has claimed responsibility for the prank pastor @entity4 's sermons reach over seven million broadcast media viewers weekly in more than 100 nations around the world			1
his popularity saw him featured as one of @entity117 of 2006 and he was also named @entity118 in @entity119 in 2006 by @entity120			0
mr @entity4 has written more than 20 books and has been criticised in the past for his apparently lavish lifestyle .			2

@entity5 pastor @entity4 fell victim to a *complex* internet prank
a statement posted online claimed mr @entity4 was questioning @entity44
a fake website and versions of news websites created to spread the rumours
but the websites and a hoax @entity34 feed have since been removed
@entity5 officials say that they *'re* aware of the hoax
