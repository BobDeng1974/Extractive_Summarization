by @entity0 @entity1 was asleep when the missile struck shortly after 9pm , exhausted by the daily exertions of looking after her two - year - old daughter			2
she was woken by the explosion			0
the bangs and booms of war have been commonplace in recent days , but she realised instantly this one was horribly close to home			2
running outside , she found her neighbour ’s house on fire			0
fortunately its owner – an elderly woman in her 80s who emigrated from @entity18 three decades ago – was staying with her daughter nearby for safety			0
two other homes lay wrecked , one in flames after a gas explosion , while another had been obliterated , replaced by a pile of rubble with an upended mattress and leatherette sofa sitting in its midst			0
a bent frying pan lay nearby , battered by the blast			0
deadly blast : smokes rises from @entity35 city rises after an attack from the north towards @entity38 emergency response : medics carry a 14 - year - old @entity41 from @entity35 into a hospital in @entity43 , 290 kilometers ( 180 miles ) east of @entity44 , @entity45			1
he was caught up in an @entity38 air strike tank : an @entity38 artillery cannon fires a shell on the border with the @entity35 ‘ i am worried for my daughter but i am still staying here , ’ said @entity1 , 39 , who lives in the southern @entity38 city of @entity53 , a repeat target for the missiles fired from @entity35			1
sirens sounded again yesterday as fearful homeowners retrieved possessions from their ruins			0
yet this passionate mother was just as alarmed to see @entity41 children being killed by @entity38 forces			1
‘ there must be some other solution than all this happening again , ’ she said			0
much of the world would share her weary sentiments as @entity38 forces and militants in the besieged @entity35 carried on trading rockets and rhetoric yesterday			1
it all feels so familiar , so forlorn , so fantastically self - defeating for both sets of citizens snared in this seemingly ceaseless and hopeless conflict			2
this time , around 130 @entity41 have been killed so far – most of them civilians , according to the @entity78			1
this number could increase rapidly as tensions rise			0
victims have included many women and children			2
@entity38 claimed to have hit another 60 ‘ terror targets ’ yesterday , as it took its tally to well over 1,000 strikes in the five days since the struggle flared up again			1
one strike on a charitable association for disabled people in northern @entity35 was reported to have left at least two women dead and four others wounded , according to medical staff			1
aftermath : @entity41 inspect the rubble of @entity98 mosque , which was destroyed in an @entity38 air strike , in @entity100 in the central @entity35 support : a man carries two young boys near the scene of the blast debris : the devastation surrounding the @entity98 mosque in @entity100			1
the @entity38 military released an aerial photo of the mosque , saying @entity112 hid rockets in it right next to another religious site and civilian homes although @entity38 says it tries hard to reduce civilian casualties , warning targets by phone minutes before their homes are destroyed , the victims also include a doctor and a pharmacist , a four - year - old boy and a man aged 80			1
clearly they are not all terrorists			0
a mosque was also demolished , although @entity38 claimed the building was being used to hide weapons			1
someone scrawled a jibe against the @entity38 prime minister on one shattered wall in response : ‘ we will prevail despite your arrogance , @entity138			1
’ both protagonists in this conflict know that propaganda is a powerful weapon			0
there were claims yesterday of @entity38 special forces advancing into @entity35 and clashing with @entity146 , the armed wing of the organisation @entity147			1
if confirmed , this would mark an alarming escalation			0
@entity38 has already mobilised 20,000 reservists and its army chief , lieutenant - general @entity151 , hinted yesterday he was ready to send tanks and troops across the boundary into @entity35			1
their last such incursion was in early 2009 , and lasted a fortnight			0
spate of attacks : @entity38 's aerial bombardment of @entity35 continued for a fifth day , with a strike on a mosque said to be concealing a weapons cache tensions : there have been over 1,000 strikes in the last five days since the struggle flare up again shelter : people sit on the floor as they take cover in the @entity172 main shopping mall , as air sirens warn of incoming rockets in the vicinity ‘ we are in the midst of an assault and we are prepared to expand it as much as is required , to wherever is required , with whatever force will be required and for as long as will be required , ’ said @entity151			1
@entity38 insists it is entitled to stop missiles being fired over its borders			1
dozens have been thwarted by its @entity184 protective shield , although i also saw a petrol station in the port of @entity188 where one narrowly missed a tanker unloading fuel but still caused serious injuries			0
but as diplomats try to find a solution to stop the bloodshed , @entity38 faces a growing global backlash over its brutal response			2
yesterday foreign secretary @entity197 expressed concern about the loss of life in @entity35 and demanded ‘ de-escalation ’ of the crisis , although he carefully endorsed @entity38 ’s right to defend itself			2
and last night in a statement approved by all of its 15 members , the @entity204 called for a ceasefire			0
this is the deadliest conflict here since november 2012 , when 180 palestinians and six @entity38 were killed			1
that crisis was eventually halted with mediation from @entity45			0
casualties : the @entity41 death toll has risen to 130 as a result of the increase in strikes so how have we reached this situation where democratic @entity38 is on the brink of its third major offensive against @entity35 in under six years – and lasting peace seems as distant as ever in this bitterly contested corner of the planet ? the core issues , of course , go back many years			1
but the latest conflict was sparked by the slaughter of three @entity38 teenagers , who disappeared while hitch - hiking home to a settlement in the @entity234			1
@entity38 blamed @entity112 , an offshoot of the @entity236 that runs @entity35 , and began rounding up activists			2
a 17 - year - old @entity41 boy was then abducted and murdered in a horrific act of reprisal as he waited for prayers at his local mosque			1
this led to riots in @entity245 and rumbling rocket fire from @entity35 , which was met in return with @entity38 air - raids and attacks			1
distraught : an @entity38 man stands at the entrance to his house after it was hit by a rocket at the heart of the struggle is @entity35 , a crowded strip of coastal land lying along @entity38 ’s western flank and home to 1.5 million @entity41			1
many are crammed into refugee camps and live in great poverty ; two - thirds do not have access even to a sewage system			0
yet behind this lie larger issues			0
many on the @entity38 @entity270 want to destroy @entity112 , an ally of @entity272 seen as a terrorist organisation by the @entity274 and @entity275 , yet others fear it might be succeeded by the sort of extreme jihadis that have emerged in @entity279 and @entity280			2
@entity112 has been weakened by @entity45 ’s new post-coup regime , which overthrew an elected @entity236 government			0
it has closed down almost all the border tunnels that were used to smuggle in cars , weapons , fuel and missile parts			0
so for all the howls of outrage , some analysts believe it suits @entity112 and its ruthless leadership to have another fight with @entity38 in order to shore up dwindling support			2
carrying on : as the conflict rages on , residents relax on a beach in @entity172 meanwhile , the latest long - term peace talks broke down in april , seemingly because @entity38 was angered by a unity deal between @entity112 and its rival @entity301			1
the two - state solution , the only realistic settlement , seems as far away as ever			0
so on one side of the barbed wire impoverished @entity41 face the onslaught of one of the world ’s most formidable war machines			2
and on the other , @entity38 must sprint into stifling underground shelters as missile sirens sound again and again			2
among those @entity18 who emigrated to @entity38 three decades ago in search of a better life only to find their homes blown apart in @entity53 was 63 - year - old @entity316			1
yet this kindly carer still invited me into her house , the bomb holes all too evident			0
‘ i am very scared because every minute there might be another rocket attack , ’ she told me			0
‘ i just feel so sad about this situation we find ourselves in			0
’ the tragedy is that there are so many human beings on both sides of this interminable and bloodstained struggle who must share her sadness .			0
