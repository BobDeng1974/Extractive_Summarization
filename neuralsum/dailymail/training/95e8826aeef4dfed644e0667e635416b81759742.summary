the approaching storm is also likely to plummet in pressure , leading to strong winds which will drive the snow and sleet			1
if the drop in pressure equals of exceeds 24milibars within 24 hours the storm will then meet the technical definition for a weather bomb - in a process known as bombogenesis			1
