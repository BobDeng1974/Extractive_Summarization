on the sunday after @entity2 ’s second wife @entity1 died of cancer , he went to the @entity4 in @entity5 , where he had performed many times			1
he kept in the background and absorbed the atmosphere			0
he really wanted to be performing , but worried that doing so so soon after @entity1 ’s death might not be seemly			2
it is a curious , even risky admission by a comedian held in considerable affection by millions that his instincts after his wife ’s death were to make people laugh — and that they had to be held in check because of ‘ decorum ’			1
tv comic @entity2 , 45 , marrying his second wife @entity19 - who died just 12 weeks later only someone like @entity2 , 57 , the son of a tube driver and a nurse , could get away with it			1
he grew up in @entity24 , south west @entity25 , wanting to be a comedian and , as he says in his autobiography published this week : ‘ humour is essential to people ’s lives			1
’ @entity19 , a producer , writer and actress , was the second of @entity2 ’s three wives			1
when she died , they ’d been together for three years , since the collapse of his six - year marriage to the actress @entity39			1
@entity40 and @entity1 were married for a mere 12 weeks			1
the wedding was a beautiful affair in @entity43 , @entity44 , where they kept a country house			0
the weakened @entity1 left the church grounds on a white horse			0
she ’d been diagnosed with breast cancer 19 months earlier , when she was 39 , in the spring of 2002 , after finding two lumps in her breast			2
everyone at the wedding knew she did n’t have many months to live			0
the original ' have i got news for you ' team ( l to r ) : @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity2 in may 1993 comedian @entity2 wearing a suit made of newspaper back in 1993 as @entity2 records with brutal irony , just three hours after a doctor told them the cancer was fast - growing and had spread beyond the lymph glands , he was recording an episode of @entity70 — a fictional place where things are eradicated forever — with fellow comedian @entity73			1
the brave @entity1 had decided after an operation not to have chemo or radiotherapy			0
she spent her final week in a hospice			0
so the age - old coalescence of tragedy and comedy had struck yet another comic			2
but @entity2 , who married again in 2009 to comedy actress and writer @entity83 , manages to wear trauma lightly			1
perhaps this is his way of coping			0
twenty - four years ago he suffered a mental breakdown , just as his career was beginning to take off , and ended up in @entity89 psychiatric hospital in @entity90 , @entity25 , for two months			1
yet in his autobiography he does n’t say it happened due to stress , insisting instead that it was down to mistakenly overdosing on anti-malaria tablets following a trip to @entity97			2
his breakdown emerged unexpectedly one evening , when he suddenly started crying while talking to a friend			2
he explained he was doing so because he thought he was @entity100			0
after that he began hallucinating — imagining that people were staring at him , and seeing 15 - inch transparent worms			2
have i got news for you 's @entity60 and @entity2 accepting a lifetime achievement award at the @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity25 in 2011 he ended up being taken by taxi to the hospital , where at least two other people were claiming to be @entity100 , and he was recognised in the canteen because he was simultaneously appearing on tv in the prerecorded comedy show @entity116 is it anyway ? three months after leaving the @entity89 , he got a phone call from @entity118 , the prolific tv production company			1
was he interested in making a pilot for a quiz show based on the week ’s news ? ‘ that ’s not for me , ’ he told them			1
‘ i do n’t do topical jokes			0
in fact i know nothing about current affairs			0
’ back came the reply : ‘ it does n’t matter			0
’ the show was the enduring hit have i got news for you , and @entity2 was to be one of the team captains			1
he says the opposing captain , @entity60 , editor of @entity139 , was also wary of being in the show , as it might affect his dignity — he was , after all , ‘ a serious journalist ’			2
@entity59 was the excellent presenter			0
but in 2002 , 12 years after the show started , the @entity144 exposed him with a lurid story about him snorting cocaine with a prostitute			1
at the next recording of have i got news for you — as the cameras rolled with @entity59 in his usual place , seated between the teams as quiz host — @entity2 leapt up and unzipped his fleece jacket to reveal the vivid @entity144 front page printed on his t - shirt			1
@entity2 says it had to be done — and it was his idea			1
@entity59 ’s predicament had to be treated with the same jovial hostility they would treat any other story , because the show was based on the week ’s news			1
a young @entity2 doing stand - up comedy on @entity167 show @entity168 not to have done so , @entity2 believes , would have prompted accusations that they could give it but not take it			1
he knew it had been uncomfortable for @entity59 , even though he , too , realised the best way of handling the situation was to make fun of it			0
@entity2 says @entity59 told him : ‘ thank you for making it funny			1
’ that might have saved his job — not to mention the show ’s underlying integrity — for the time being , but when the next series opened there were even more accusations about @entity59 ’s private life			2
they ’d managed the first situation , but there would be no laughing away his discomfort the second time around			0
so he was out and — although @entity2 does n’t say so in his memoir — is said to blame @entity2 and @entity60 for forcing the issue			1
despite his absence , have i got news for you continued from strength to strength , using guest hosts			2
@entity2 mentions that former @entity201 leader @entity200 has been the worst			1
he was so slow reading the autocue that the episode took more than two hours to record — the longest time ever			0
@entity2 admits that , like @entity59 , he ’s had drug experiences — although never as a consumer			1
he tells an extraordinary story of spending an evening rolling joints for @entity208 and other guests at @entity208 ’s flat in @entity210 , north @entity25			2
he ’d been invited with fellow comic and friend @entity211 and half - a - dozen others			0
‘ @entity208 was one of my great comic heroes when i was growing up , ’ writes @entity2			1
‘ his wit , elegance and charm inspired me			0
’ @entity2 in @entity218 and @entity220 's @entity219 alongside @entity39 @entity83 , @entity2 's wife , in a promo shot for the play they starred in together - @entity224 in the kitchen , @entity2 , a former council - house boy who says his interminable wise - cracking as a youngster lost him any number of friends , found another idol from his childhood — @entity232 ’s @entity231			1
although there was plenty of alcohol , @entity2 says he did n’t drink much as he was anxious not to act star - struck			1
there was also cannabis for anyone who wanted some			0
here , surely , was a situation that most people who refuse to have anything to do with drugs would find extremely embarrassing			2
@entity2 , however , handled it with enviable aplomb			1
@entity208 and @entity231 were sitting next to each other , and @entity2 offered to sit near them , rolling their joints for them			1
@entity208 replied : ‘ what a sensible arrangement			0
what i like about cannabis is it does what it says it ’s going to do			0
’ just why @entity2 did n’t think his toe - curling offer would make him look like the ultimate ‘ fanboy ’ — especially as he did n’t know how to stick the papers together — he does n’t say			2
but he spent a happy evening listening to the talk of his comic heroes and , every so often , rolling a joint that was passed around the room			0
what fun have i got news for you could have with his pot - sodden evening			0
the one drugs scare that did panic him into rushing out early to buy a copy of a tabloid newspaper in @entity268 was while he was recording an edition of have i got news for you			0
his publicity agent called his wife @entity1 to warn her that the following day ’s @entity273 would have six pages about @entity2 ’s supposed cocaine habit			1
after a sleepless night , he opened the paper to discover , much to his relief , that the cocaine user in question was actually @entity280 , the @entity281 and @entity282 footballer , who is now a tv pundit			0
@entity2 tells these stories lightly and with self - deprecation			2
after all , the lure of comedy has never been far away			0
in his youth he worked briefly as a meat packer for @entity289 ’s and for three years as a civil servant for @entity292 employment office in @entity25			2
but , to the dismay of his parents , he gave up secure employment without knowing whether he ’d ever make more than the few quid his early gigs brought in			0
even when he was losing his virginity — the moment , he says , when ‘ the young gazelle becomes a man ’ — with a girl called @entity300 , whom he met in a pub , the then 20 - year - old @entity2 was distracted by comedy			1
they were in the middle of the act itself when a joke popped into his head so good that he was desperate not to forget it			0
‘ “ @entity300 , ” i said , “ i ’m sorry , do you mind if we stop for a moment … i ’ve just got to write something down			0
” ’ so was it worth the interruption ? judge for yourself			0
the joke was : ‘ i learned @entity318 the hard way — from a @entity320			0
’ only when i laugh by @entity2 ( @entity321 , £ 20 ) .			2

@entity2 was with his second wife for 12 weeks before she died from cancer

suffered mental breakdown 24 years ago just as career was starting
