by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 13:51 est , 19 march 2013 these curious pictures look as though they could be of some mysterious cosmic event - but in fact they are artworks created using a high - powered drill			0
the power - tool art attack is the work of @entity7 who captures the flight of paint from the end of a drill bit with a camera exposure of just one 40,000th of a second			1
his latest ' @entity16 ' series celebrates the physics of centripetal force and the effects it has on simple paint and an ordinary drill with a metal rod on the end			1
vortex : the amazing swirls of colour created by artist @entity7 using paint and a drill swirling : mr @entity7 uses an exposure of just one 40,000th of a second to capture these amazing freeze - frames colourful : @entity35 force flings the paint from the drill bit at high speed to make these mesmerising patterns vibrant : ' the motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye , ' mr @entity7 said @entity45 : the artist connects a sensor to the drill bit to fire his camera and flash at just the right moment spiral : mr @entity7 's gear is capable of making flashes as short as 1/40,000 of a second , freezing the motion the incredible result of mr @entity7 's work comes out looking like a picture taken on the @entity60 of some cosmic event			1
the 29 - year - old , from @entity65 , said : ' the motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye , the images you see are taken only millisecond after the drill was turned on			1
' to capture the moment , where the paint forms that distinctive shape , i connected a sensor to the drill , which sends an impulse to the flashes			1
' these specialised units are capable of creating flashes as short as a 1/40000 of a second , freezing the motion of the paint			0
' @entity82 : mr @entity7 said his work was trying to bring the worlds of art and science together in one place wild : @entity90 's drip paintings gave mr @entity7 the inspiration for this series of pictures difference : unlike @entity90 , however , the focus of these artworks is the action itself , mr @entity7 says anger : many of the pictures look like silly string swung around in a circle mr @entity7 at work in his studio : his work has just been exhibited in @entity107 , @entity65 mr @entity7 said his work was trying to bring the worlds of art and science together in one place			2
' the way that the structures and colours you see in the images are created was by using very simple , scientific phenomena , ' he said			0
' by showing this phenomena in an unseen an poetic way , i would like to invite the viewer to find out more about it , which will hopefully make us appreciate the magic that 's constantly around us even more			0
' the inspiration for this project in particular comes from looking at the drip paintings of @entity90			0
' contrary to @entity130 masterpieces , which show the result of his action painting , i am putting the focus on showing the action itself			0
' mr @entity7 's work has just been exhibited in @entity107 , @entity65 , and featured in both scientific and art journals .			2

@entity65 artist coats drill bit with paint before turning it on and *photographing* the resulting swirls of colour
he uses special sensors connected to the drill to fire the flash and push the *shutter* at speeds of one 40,000th of a second
