by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:22 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 has drawn up plans to ‘ decapitate ’ the @entity5 by ousting @entity6 from @entity7 at the next election			1
@entity9 yesterday issued a humiliating public rebuff to the @entity5 leader after he hinted he would like to form a coalition with @entity3 after the next election			1
and a source on @entity3 ’s ruling @entity14 told the @entity15 the party was now ‘ pouring resources ’ into mr @entity6 ’s @entity19 constituency in a bid to get him booted out by the voters next year			1
embarassing : @entity9 ( left ) yesterday issued a humiliating public rebuff to @entity6 after he hinted he would like to form a coaltion with @entity3 after the next election ‘ we are going to go after @entity6 hard , ’ the source said			1
‘ we are already pouring resources in because although he ’s got a big majority it is very soft			0
' a lot of them are students and there is a huge amount of anger locally about the @entity37 ’s cuts			0
’ another @entity3 source said the party was aiming to produce a ‘ @entity41 moment ’ - a reference to @entity41 ’s shock defeat at the 1997 election which ruled him out of the subsequent conservative leadership contest			2
the revelation threatens to plunge relations between mr @entity6 and mr @entity9 into the deep freeze at a time when the @entity5 leader is trying to reach out to labour about the possibility of forming a coalition after next year ’s election			1
in an interview for a @entity57 documentary broadcast yesterday mr @entity6 said @entity3 had ‘ changed ’ and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy			1
the @entity5 leader was also scathing about his @entity60 coalition partners , saying they had lurched to the right and lost touch with the concerns of ordinary voters			0
ideology : in an interview for a @entity57 documentary broadcast yesterday mr @entity6 said @entity3 had ' changed ' and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy ‘ they ’ve become much more ideological , ’ he said			1
‘ they ’ve returned much more to a lot of their familiar theme tunes			0
‘ i think it would be best for everybody if the @entity78 were to rediscover a talent for actually talking to mainstream voters about mainstream concerns			0
’ mr @entity9 yesterday rejected mr @entity6 ’s overtures , saying he was focused on securing a @entity3 victory next year			1
‘ i think what i ’m looking for is a majority @entity3 government , ’ he said			2
‘ there are such big issues that the country faces , i think @entity6 should be worried about the @entity5			2
’ when pushed on whether he would consider a coalition with the @entity5 , mr @entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t think the parties , in advance of elections , should be engaging in this			2
i think what they should be engaging in is how are we going to change the country ? what are we offering the country ? and that ’s what i ’m interested in			0
’ many senior @entity3 figures see mr @entity6 as an obstacle to a potential coalition deal			1
they argue it would be impossible for a man who has propped up a @entity78 prime minister for five years to ever be accepted into a @entity3 - led government			1
previous efforts : the last party to attempt a ' decapitation strategy ' was the @entity5 , who tried to oust the then @entity60 leader @entity113 during the 2005 election removing mr @entity6 from @entity7 would force him to quit as @entity5 leader , leaving @entity3 to deal with a more palatable figure if the election produces another hung parliament			2
mr @entity6 has one of the safest @entity5 seats in the country , with a majority of 15,000			0
@entity3 has never won the seat			0
but the constituency also has one of the highest concentrations of student voters in the country			0
@entity3 believes many of them remain furious with mr @entity6 for his betrayal over student tuition fees			2
ironically the last party to attempt a ‘ decapitation strategy ’ was the @entity5 , who tried to oust the then @entity60 leader @entity113 and senior figures , including @entity134 and @entity135 at the 2005 election			0
the initiative was largely unsuccessful after @entity60 activists flooded the targeted constituencies to shore up their vote .			0

@entity9 issued a humiliating public rebuff to the *deputy* prime minister
came after @entity6 hinted he would like to form a coalition with @entity3
senior @entity3 figures believe he would be an obstacle in the government
