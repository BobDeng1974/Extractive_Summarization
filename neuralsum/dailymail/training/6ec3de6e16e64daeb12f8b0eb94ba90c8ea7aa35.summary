it prides itself on being ‘ the fourth emergency service ’ – but the @entity2 had to turn to arch rivals the @entity4 for a tow after one of its cars broke down			2
this @entity10 car got a puncture during a driving lesson at @entity13 , near @entity14 , and was left stranded because it did not have a spare wheel			1
an appeal for help to the @entity2 ’s own breakdown service was rejected for an unknown reason , but the company that leased the @entity21 to the @entity2 was covered by the @entity4 and so the @entity4 ’s breakdown staff were called in to tow it to a garage for a tyre change			1
embarrassing : the @entity2 had to sheepishly turn to arch rivals the @entity4 for a tow after one of its cars broke down @entity28 , spokesman for the @entity4 , said : ' the @entity10 vehicle got a puncture but like so many new cars coming off the production line it was n’t carrying a spare wheel			1
' the driving instructor called the @entity2 but for reasons unbeknownst to us they were n’t prepared to go to the rescue of the car			2
' it turns out the car was leased to the @entity2 by a company which was covered by the @entity4 - and so we happily obliged to help out			0
' we were able to pick up the car and take it to the nearest @entity44 to get the tyre fixed			0
stricken : the @entity10 motor suffered a puncture while on a driving lesson and was left stranded because the car did n't have a spare wheel ' i ’m sure the decision not to help out their own driving school is one the @entity2 is regretting now			1
' on a serious note , we have been campaigning for a while now for car dealers to make buyers of new cars aware of the trend of not including spare wheels			0
' the @entity4 comes to the rescue of a lot of drivers who have been caught out because they have n’t realised their car has no spare			0
