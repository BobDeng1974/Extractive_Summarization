the @entity0 revealed today that cyber attackers linked to the @entity3 government attempted to hack into a computer system in the @entity5			1
while the official statement down played the attack , saying that it was aiming for an unclassified ' isolated ' network , one report claimed that the hackers targeted the @entity5 which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes			1
' this was a spear phishing attack against an unclassified network			2
these types of attacks are not infrequent and we have mitigation measures in place , ' a @entity0 official told @entity21			1
@entity23 phishing is a common form of hacking where a cyber attacker will send an email to it 's target and hope that the recipient clicks on the links of downloads the attachments enclosed in the email in order to allow their malicious software to infiltrate the recipient 's computer and data			1
@entity0 officials confirmed that a hackers did try to ' phish ' into the @entity43 server but said there was no damage done ' in this instance the attack was identified , the system was isolated , and there is no indication whatsoever that any exfiltration of data took place			1
moreover , there was never any impact or attempted breach of any classified system , ' the @entity0 official continued			1
a conservative newspaper that has been regularly critical of the @entity60 administration , called the @entity61 , first published the report on sunday and said that the attackers were linked to the @entity3 government			0
they wrote that the attack , which allegedly occurred earlier in september , was yet another example of the ' failure of the @entity60 administration to press @entity3 on its persistent cyber attacks '			0
in response to the article , an unnamed @entity0 official contacted @entity73 to clarify the story , saying that while the ' attempted ' hack did take place , it did not cause any damage because the targeted system did not contain any sensitive data			1
the breach occurred using a ' spear phishing ' tactic , in which a hacker sends uses common phrases or inviting subject lines to draw the recipient in and attract their attention in hope of gaining access ot their computer			0
sensitive : the @entity43 , which was targeted in the attack , is in charge of securing the ' nuclear football ' which is the black briefcase ( pictured ) that contains the nuclear launch codes once those steps are taken - and it is unclear whether they were in this case - the links or attachments enable the hacker to download their malicious software , also known as malware			1
while the attacks on government officials provides the greatest risk in the political realm , private @entity107 businesses have also been the target of @entity3 hackers			0
in november 2011 , the @entity114 released a report detailing the extent of damage done by @entity3 and @entity119 hackers on various companies			1
one example was that of a paint company called @entity123 , which had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen			0
the move cost the company $ 20million			0
@entity128 , a @entity129 electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in @entity131 including iphones , was hacked in february by a group called @entity134 which then obtained and released the email and credit card data for banking information for @entity107 companies including @entity139 and @entity140			0
the state - run @entity142 system in @entity144 was hacked last month , prompting calls for tightened security around any government health databases that would be implemented in accordance with the @entity149			0
administrators claimed that no personal medical data was removed from the site but it was not operational for ten days			0
though the political slant of the @entity61 reporting is clear , it is also true that this is not the first time that @entity3 hackers have gotten unnervingly close to @entity0 communications			1
the @entity160 reported that in june 2011 , @entity162 and @entity163 officials confirmed that a wide - ranging phishing attack had taken place after the hackers had directed malware towards the personal @entity169 accounts of an unknown number of @entity0 staffers			1
the @entity163 never released the names , or even t he number of staffers who were thought to be targeted in the attack			2
in the latest hacking , however , the target was much more clear and focused solely on the @entity5			0
the @entity43 is in charge of arranging the president 's travel , coordinating inter-office conference calls between top government officials , and most notably the security of the so - called ' nuclear football ' , the nickname for the suitcase that contains and controls all of the nuclear launch codes			1
the @entity61 , which @entity73 points out published a story about a @entity119 submarine trolling in @entity107 waters which was flatly denied by numerous government agencies , says a breach in this office would be devastating to the country 's security			2
' this is the most sensitive office in the @entity131 government , ' an unidentified former @entity131 intelligence official told the paper			0
' a compromise there would cause grave strategic damage to the @entity131			2
' the threat of a damaging cyber attack has raised the alarm in the highest levels of government , as president @entity60 penned an op - ed in the @entity208 last year pushing for more dedication to digital security			2
' so far , no one has managed to seriously damage or disrupt our critical infrastructure networks			2
but foreign governments , criminal syndicates and lone individuals are probing our financial , energy and public safety systems every day , ' he wrote .			0

@entity0 confirmed the hack but *downplayed* it , saying no damage was done and it was *unsuccessful*
@entity43 targeted which controls the president 's travel , *interoffice* communications , and nuclear codes
