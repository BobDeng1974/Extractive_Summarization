thursday night : @entity0 and a friend at the @entity4 last night in @entity5 it was the six second clip that sent the internet into a frenzy of speculation - what caused one @entity12 fan to suddenly stop stroking the hair of one blond man and then turn ashen faced as she realized she was on camera during the @entity4 ? had she been caught with another man ? had she been busted at the big game after calling in sick ? and who was the stony faced blond man who appeared unmoved by her affections ? the answer is far less scandalous than some online rumors suggested and far more innocent than others would want			1
the somewhat sheepish looking fan is @entity0 , 23 , an @entity27 substitute teacher who was simply consoling her long term boyfriend , @entity1 , after a decisive play did not go their way			1
unfortunately for the gossip mongers online , she had not been caught with her hand in the metaphorical cookie jar			1
indeed , another video recorded just seconds before the viral clip of @entity37 , shows the truth and reveals how out of context the mysterious footage is			2
in it , @entity41 holds her head in her hands and then turns her attention to @entity1 , who begins to shake his head with disappointment after a @entity49 failure			0
her hand rubs the top of his head and then makes its way down to the back of his neck , which is the point where the much discussed six second @entity57 video begins			0
when viewed together , the full story of what really happened becomes clearer			2
it becomes obvious that @entity41 was not caught red - handed by the cameras up to no good , despite what people may want			2
she simply did not know what to do with her hand and just left her boyfriend to his own devices after trying to make him feel better			0
when the @entity67 spoke to @entity41 's mother @entity68 , she said that her daughter had been seeing @entity1 , ' for quite some time ' and said that the @entity70 and the @entity71 were family friends			0
scroll down for @entity72 friends : @entity41 and @entity74 ( right and second right ) with friends back home in @entity27 have been revealed as the couple at the center of a viral video sensation innocent : @entity0 graduated from the @entity82 and works as a substitute teacher national attention : @entity41 is no doubt aware that she has become a viral sensation overnight and the video clip that she features in has been viewed more than 13 million times having posted the video - which has been viewed more than 13 million times - onto her own @entity90 page , @entity68 laughed at the attention her daughter had received			1
' she was n't guilty of anything , ' said @entity68 , amused at how out of context the clip had been taken			1
it all began last night when @entity96 posted the clip online and titled it , ' when you 're at the game with your side dude and realize you 're on tv '			1
others joined in the speculation			0
act natural : @entity0 appeared to be stroking the back of the blond man 's head - but when she realized the camera 's were on her she suddenly flinched and pulled back her hand one imaginative viewer posited that @entity41 and @entity1 had taken mind altering drugs and the sudden attention of the camea sent her into a deep and sudden crisis			1
apaprently this theory was supported by the guy behind them , presumably their friend , shouting a comforting ' we 're okay ! '			0
other commentators even suggested that @entity41 had too much to drink and her real boyfriend was the guy on the other side of her , to her left			0
others even questioned whether @entity41 's boyfriend had made a bad smell and some just thought she had the look of a woman who left the gas on			0
horrified , but why ? @entity41 looks positively mortified to have been caught on camera and appears to try and style it out what have i done ? the @entity41 suddenly seems extremely preoccupied , unlike the man behind her who is loving being on television			2

@entity12 fan , @entity0 , caught acting very *suspiciously* during @entity4
the six second clip set of a frenzy of speculation online
her guilty *reaction* to being captured on camera has been viewed 13 million times
