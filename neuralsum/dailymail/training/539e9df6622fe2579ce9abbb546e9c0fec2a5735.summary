football at @entity1 always piles the pressure on managers			0
for two in particular there will be extra focus on what they do between now and the new year			0
@entity8 is going through his first truly tough spell as @entity11 boss , while @entity12 has overseen @entity14 ’s fall from @entity16 finalists to relegation strugglers			1
for @entity8 , it has been an exceptional season until recently			1
for @entity12 , things are in danger of sliding out of control			1
in august nobody gave @entity11 a chance			1
the club was gutted when the chief executive , manager , captain and star players all left			0
many tipped them for a fight against the drop but i thought their squad was well equipped to cope , if not excel			0
after a brilliant start to the season , @entity8 's @entity11 have lost their last five games they have a good manager and a talented group of players			1
their success has been surprising and that has generated a pressure of its own			0
when results are good , expectations rise			0
when they went 1 - 0 down to @entity48 you could see the knives being sharpened but they recovered to snatch a draw			0
there ’s no shame in losing to @entity53 , @entity54 or @entity55 but the defeat at @entity57 hurt			0
follow that with a @entity60 exit at @entity61 and suddenly cracks appear			0
@entity8 did n’t like the behaviour of the @entity65 ’ bench and refused to shake @entity67 ’s hand			1
he comes across as a calm , considered manager but he finally snapped			0
i ’ve been dumped out of the cup at @entity72 and the place can feel like a bear pit			0
it ’s a proper , old - fashioned ground and they did everything possible to make @entity11 uncomfortable			2
@entity12 's @entity14 have only won one match out of their last 15 and are 19th in the @entity80 it ’s no great surprise when teams from lower divisions try to disrupt opponents			1
i doubt @entity67 was involved — after all this is the son of a man who put a sign in front of raucous @entity90 fans pleading : ‘ gentlemen , no swearing please			0
’ @entity8 is very competitive and a top manager , so frustration at his side ’s form and @entity55 ’s gamesmanship finally brought him to the boil			1
it ’s hard , too , for a manager who was once a great player — @entity8 ca n’t go and smash in a free - kick himself if things are n’t going well			2
it was a bad defeat and if @entity11 are not careful it could be the one that derails their season			1
they face @entity107 on saturday and are unlucky with the festive fixtures , with @entity109 and @entity54 back to back over the new year			0
saints have suffered two disappointing defeats in the last two matches to @entity57 and @entity61 this is @entity8 ’s first real test and it will be fascinating to see how he deals with it — until a few weeks ago it was almost the perfect season			1
i can not say the same of @entity14			2
after a fair start , @entity12 ’s side are in freefall			1
they have not won since the start of october and have taken only four points from 27			0
last season @entity12 kept them up and took them to @entity126 , an incredible achievement			1
that gave @entity14 the confidence to spend £ 40million in the summer , a huge amount for a club of their size			1
for the most part , those signings have not worked			2
@entity14 spent millions on @entity136 and @entity137 but both have fallen victim to injury @entity137 cost £ 8m but was unlucky to dislocate his kneecap			1
at £ 10m @entity142 was the club ’s record buy but he has scored just three goals and @entity136 is the latest signing to suffer injury			0
@entity12 has a history of using the transfer market to save his team			2
in 2003 @entity151 helped him keep @entity152 in the @entity80 and last january @entity153 and @entity154 boosted @entity14			2
but after that £ 40m summer outlay , how many more times can he dig into the club ’s pockets ? the tough times are when managers find out exactly what their players are made of			0
if @entity8 ’s struggles continue , his success will be seen as a flash in the pan			2
if @entity12 ’s go on , he could well be fighting for his future			2
at £ 10million , @entity142 is @entity14 's record signing but he has only scored three goals so far			1

both @entity14 and @entity11 have struggled for form of late
@entity8 's side started well this season but have *stuttered* recently
@entity12 led @entity14 to the @entity16 final but they have been poor since
@entity14 also spent £ 40million on new signings , and all have disappointed
