gazing suggestively at the camera , @entity1 ’s modelling campaign for @entity3 perfume certainly looks provocative			1
however , it ’s not the 22 - year - old ’s sultry pose that has triggered controversy , but the h - like symbol on her wrist			2
the advert featuring the model daughter of @entity13 , part of a campaign by @entity17 fashion house @entity3 , has been singled out by followers of a branch of @entity20 , who said it ‘ cheapens ’ and ‘ degrades ’ one of its holiest symbols			1
the campaign – put together by @entity17 fashion house @entity3 to promote a designer fragrance – shows miss @entity1 with an ornate h - like symbol on her skin			1
it ’s similar to a sign @entity29 use to refer to @entity50 and representatives of the community have said it is ‘ heartbreaking ’ to see it used to make money			1
there are an estimated 500,000 adherents of @entity29 worldwide and they are demanding the symbol , which they have previously had trademarked , be removed from the adverts			1
@entity61 student @entity60 , one of the protest organisers , said : ‘ to use something that means so much to us for corporate profit cheapens our sacred symbol			0
it ’s disrespectful , offensive and degrading			0
protest : @entity29 claim the @entity17 design house has inappropriately used a symbol sacred to practitioners of their mystical faith and have protested on several locations , such as outside @entity38 in @entity30 ‘ we have this sign that to us represents blessed peace			1
to see it disgraced like this for a company to make money is heartbreaking			0
’ @entity3 , which has used the image in campaigns since 2011 , claims the symbols are not the same			2
it is a stance supported by the @entity85 , which last month rejected a request by @entity88 groups to ban the company from using the sign			0
same , same , but different : @entity17 fashion designer @entity3 has been using the image in campaigns since 2011 a spokesman for the fashion house said they are ‘ deeply saddened by the distress expressed by ’ the @entity88 community but that they hope the @entity85 ruling will ‘ convince the @entity29 religion of the complete good faith and the groundlessness of their requests ’			1
despite the ruling , campaigners have kept up the pressure on social media using the hashtag ‘ @entity107 ’ and have singled out miss @entity1 ’s campaign , which includes a video where the model refers to the symbol as a ‘ snakebite ’ and a ‘ sign of seduction ’			1
in a video produced by @entity88 activists , which has been watched more than 12,000 times on @entity118 , they accuse @entity119 of ‘ tearing communities apart ’			0
they pose the questions : ‘ how long should people wait for action to be taken against the injustices witnessed around the world ? ‘ how long should we allow and tolerate @entity3 ’s vindictive attack on faith by supporting and encouraging mistreatment of faith ? ’ this is not the first time @entity3 has run into trouble over the use of religious symbols			2
ten years ago , they made a line of bikinis which depicted @entity140 gods			0
the swimwear was stocked by @entity38 but was pulled off the shelves after a backlash from faith groups			0
the fashion house apologised at the time and said any offence was unintentional			0
miss @entity1 has also modelled for brands including @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 and appeared in the @entity152 as one of the representatives of @entity156 fashion , alongside @entity157 , 44 , and @entity158 , 40			2

@entity3 has been using sign in his campaign since 2011
h - like symbol seen on skin of @entity1 in perfume ad
@entity29 say it is the symbol used by them to refer to @entity50
*thousands* have protested in @entity30 , @entity40 and @entity41
