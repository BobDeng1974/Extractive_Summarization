in the near future our cars , trains and planes could be powered by hydrogen produced by bacteria that survives in the most extreme conditions on @entity8			1
scientists ' accidentally ' discovered a bacterium under conditions of extremely high saline and alkaline levels			1
these conditions , in theory , could be replicated in an industrial setting to produce the biofuel on a large scale			1
biological scientists have discovered a bacterium , known as @entity21 ( pictured ) that produces hydrogen under high saline and alkaline conditions			1
these conditions , in theory , could be replicated in industrial settings to produce the biohydrogen fuel on an large scale dr @entity30 , professor of biological sciences at @entity32 discovered the bacterium @entity21 in @entity34 , @entity35			1
it is termed as extreme bacterium , or an ‘ extremophile ’ - a microorganism that lives in conditions of extreme temperature , acidity , alkalinity or chemical concentration			1
during tests , the researchers found that the bacterium produces hydrogen under saline and alkaline conditions in amounts that rival genetically modified organisms			1
the bacterium also produced an organic compound known as 1 , 3 - propenediol			1
hydrogen produced by living organisms is called biohydrogen and is a type of fuel , similar to bio-diesel or bio-gas			1
biofuels can be taken from food crops , known as ‘ first generation biofuels ’ , waste , known as ‘ second generation ’ , and microbes , referred to as ‘ third ’ or ‘ advanced ’ generation biofuels			0
@entity69 is an example of an advanced biofuel			0
extracting third - generation biofuels is beneficial because it does n’t impact on food production , or costs , and is said to be around 10 times more efficient as capturing sunlight compared to waste			2
this means that smaller areas of land are needed to produce the same amount of fuel			2
this compound can be used in industrial products including adhesives , laminates and coatings			1
@entity88 also a solvent and can be used as antifreeze			2
living in such a hostile environment , @entity91 is said to have ‘ metabolic capabilities ’ under similar conditions seen at some contaminated waste sites			0
the work builds on dr @entity30 ’s previous research into the bacterium from 2012			0
@entity100 has a very high energy density , three times that of petrol or diesel , and it produces water as a byproduct			2
it can also be used in fuel cells that are said to be twice as efficient as combustion engines			0
@entity100 is n’t an energy source in its own right , however			0
instead , it carries energy from other types of renewable sources including the sun and the wind , as well as water			0
in particular , hydrogen produced by living organisms is called biohydrogen and is similar to bio-diesel or bio-gas			2
biofuels can be taken from food crops , known as ‘ first generation biofuels ’ , waste , known as ‘ second generation ’ , and microbes , referred to as ‘ third ’ or ‘ advanced ’ generation biofuels			0
@entity69 is an example of an advanced biofuel , and it is already be taken from algae and bacteria , for example			0
experts from @entity32 discovered the bacterium @entity21 in @entity34 , @entity35 ( marked )			1
the bacterium also produced an organic compound known as 1 , 3 - propenediol used in industrial products , and can be used as antifreeze @entity100 has a higher energy density than petrol or diesel			1
it is also used in fuel cells ( pictured ) , that are twice as efficient as combustion engines extracting third - generation biofuels is beneficial because it does n’t impact on food production , or costs , and is said to be around 10 times more efficient as capturing sunlight compared to ' second - generation ' waste			0
this means that smaller areas of land are needed to produce the same amount of fuel			0
the discovery of the biohydrogen produced by @entity21 was made by accident while studying extremophiles found in @entity34 , @entity35			1
dr @entity30 said she became interested in bacteria in the region because of its potential to clean up the environment			0
in particular , dr @entity30 expected to find an iron - reducing bacterium and describe a new species			2
instead , she found this species that can produce hydrogen and 1 , 3 - propanediol under high ph and salinity conditions that might turn out to be valuable industrially			1
‘ usually , i tend to study the overall microbial ecology of extreme environments , but this particular bacterium has caught my attention , ’ dr @entity30 said			2
‘ i intend to study this isolate in greater detail			0
’ ‘ it would be great if we got liters and liters of production of hydrogen			0
' however , we have not been able to scale up yet			0
’ the infrastructure is n’t currently in place for hydrogen to replace gasoline , but , continued dr @entity30 , if hydrogen becomes an alternative to gasoline , @entity185 , mass - produced on an industrial scale , could be a viable solution			1
the findings are published in @entity196 .			0

experts found @entity200 *hydrogeninformans* in @entity35
the ' extremophile ' lives in conditions of extreme alkalinity and salinity
under these conditions , experts said it produces high levels of hydrogen
in theory , these conditions could be replicated to produce biohydrogen for *vehicles* on an industrial scale
bacterium also produced an organic compound known as 1 , 3 - propenediol
this compound is seen in industrial products and is used as antifreeze
