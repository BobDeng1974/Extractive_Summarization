by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:29 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 07:58 est , 10 june 2012 @entity3 citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £ 20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the @entity3 under a new immigration clampdown			1
the planned changes mean lower - paid @entity3 would be forced to emigrate if they wanted to live with a loved one from overseas			1
and if the foreign - born spouse had children , their @entity3 partner would have to earn £ 30,000 or more , depending on how many children they had			1
clampdown : @entity3 citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least £ 20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the @entity3			1
home secretary @entity17 is pictured talking about the new policy on the @entity19 today they will also have to pass a strict new ' combined attachment test ' to prove they share a genuine loyalty to @entity3 , not another country , and they will remain on probation for five years instead of the current two			1
the proposals , to be announced by home secretary @entity17 , are expected to cut immigration , currently standing at 250,000 a year , by 25,000			1
they are designed primarily to combat claims that some foreigners are marrying @entity3 to take advantage of the @entity3 's generous welfare system			1
speaking on the @entity19 today , mrs may said : ' i think it is important that if people are bringing people into the @entity3 to create a family here in the @entity3 that we say that you should be able to support yourselves and not be reliant on the state			1
' @entity46 @entity45 last night welcomed the move but @entity49 spokesman @entity48 said : ' these new measures have more to do with @entity17 's abject failure to live up to her promise to cut immigration than fairness			1
' he claimed the idea was ' poorly thought out ' , adding : ' it seems very unfair that a poor @entity3 man or woman can fall in love with someone from @entity61 or @entity62 and be prevented from getting married and making a home here , while a rich person can			1
' @entity49 mp @entity48 called the plans ' poorly thought - out ' he said a better way to deal with the problem would be to insist that @entity3 who marry foreigners and settle here provide a bond worth ' a substantial sum '			1
if the immigrant went on to claim benefits , the money would be deducted from the bond			0
and immigration campaigners are expected to denounce the measures , claiming the new curbs would effectively give low - earning @entity3 who fall in love with foreigners the choice of indefinite ' exile ' – or breaking up their family if they want to stay in the @entity3			1
the home secretary also issued a warning to judges today that their powers to block the deportation of foreign criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed			1
mrs may said she would be seeking the backing of @entity93 for new guidelines for the courts spelling out how the courts should apply the @entity97 in such cases			2
in particular , she said she would be making clear that the right to a family life enshrined in @entity101 of the convention - used by some foreign criminals to appeal against removal from the country - was not absolute			1
she complained the judges were not taking account of the wider public interest in the way the convention enabled them to			2
and she warned that if they ignored the will of @entity93 , she would bring in new legislation to ensure that it was enforced			0
' this is not an absolute right			0
so in the interests of the economy or of controlling migration or of public order - those sort of issues - the state has a right to qualify this right to a family life , ' she said			2
' what i am going to do is actually set out the rules that say this is what @entity93 , this is what the public believe is how you balance the public interest against the individual 's interest			0
' we are going to ask @entity93 to vote on this to say very clearly what constitutes the right to a family life			0
' i would expect that judges will look at what @entity93 will say and that they will take into account what @entity93 has said			2
if they do n't then we will have to look at other measures and that could include primary legislation			0
' firm : the home secretary also issued a warning to judges today that their powers to block the deportation of foreign criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed mrs may said that the @entity158 was also looking at contingency arrangements in case the the eurozone crisis triggered a flood of immigrants into @entity3			1
' so far we are not seeing any trends in any increased movements , despite obviously significant problems already economically in a number of eurozone countries , ' she said			0
' but i think that it is right that , as a government , across the board we look at the contingency arrangements that might be needed			0
' behind bars : in april , @entity174 , pictured , was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed £ 30,000 in proceeds a senior @entity173 source said last night : ' the welfare system has abused for years under @entity49 by people who marry @entity3 and within a short period are living off benefits			1
' there is little we can do to stop them claiming benefits but we can implement better controls on people who come here to marry in the first place			0
we are confident these moves will command widespread support from the public			0
' @entity49 's lamentable record on immigration is one of the main reasons they lost the election			2
we are going to put the system right			0
' ms may said earlier this year that it was obvious that @entity3 citizens and those settled here should be able to marry or enter into a civil partnership with whomever they choose			1
but she added : ' if they want to establish their family life in the @entity3 , rather than overseas , then their spouse or partner must have a genuine attachment to the @entity3 , be able to speak @entity212 , and integrate into our society , and they must not be a burden on the taxpayer			1
' families should be able to manage their own lives			0
if a @entity3 citizen or a person settled here can not support their foreign spouse or partner they can not expect the taxpayer to do it for them			1
' the @entity226 for the @entity227 says an extension of the probationary period for foreign spouses could trap more women in violent marriages because of the fear of being deported if they complain			2
mr @entity48 added : ' at a time when our national finances are hard - stretched it is only fair that anyone wanting to bring someone new to this country should be able to prove that they will not be a burden on the @entity243			2
' but i worry that the government will not achieve what it hopes with this measure , and that they have rejected options that could provide better protection for the taxpayer and be fairer too			0
' in today 's climate , someone on £ 20,000 today could all too easily be earning nothing tomorrow			0
' so simply relying on income as a measure may lead to the taxpayer still being exposed			0
' in april , a vicar was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed £ 30,000 in proceeds			0
jailed : the @entity174 , 56 , was jailed for four and a half years for arranging bogus ceremonies for @entity264 nationals to marry @entity266 citizens so they could stay in @entity3			1
the @entity174 , 56 , was jailed for four and a half years for arranging bogus ceremonies for @entity264 nationals to marry @entity266 citizens so they could stay in @entity3			2
the vicar , whose motivation was described as financial , travelled around the world on the money			0
most of the bogus couples , who were being married at a rate of seven a day at one point , had already been refused leave to remain in @entity3			2
the sham marriages at @entity277 in @entity278 , @entity279 , were ‘ meticulously planned ’			0
@entity174 , who lives with his male partner in @entity281 , @entity282 , presided over almost all of the marriages			0
he charged £ 140 a time and , instead of handing the money to the diocese and the @entity287 , he pocketed it			0
