by @entity1 reporter published : 19:26 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 15 january 2013 @entity3 wildlife officials say 11 @entity5 pythons have been killed during the first three days of a public hunt for the non-native species in the @entity8			1
the @entity9 says more than 1,000 people from more than 30 states have registered to compete in the month - long ‘ @entity12			1
’ the pythons killed since the competition began saturday will be processed by the @entity15			1
as well as culling @entity3 ’s population of invasive @entity5 pythons , the purpose of the hunt is also to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem			1
it 's unknown how many pythons live in the @entity8			1
researchers say the large snakes menace native wildlife			2
@entity3 law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets			2
hunters are restricted to four state wildlife management areas ; @entity56 is off - limits			2
they may use some firearms , as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons			2
native species may not be taken			0
the state is offering cash prizes to whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons by the time the competition ends at midnight feb. 10			2
@entity3 state is offering cash prizes to whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons by the time the competition ends at midnight feb. 10 captain @entity23 , of @entity74 's @entity73 unit , displays a 13 - foot snake that was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool dozens of would - be python hunters showed up for some last - minute training in snake handling saturday morning at the @entity15 @entity81 in @entity82			1
the training came down to common sense : drink water , wear sunscreen , do n't get bitten by anything and do n't shoot anyone			0
many of the onlookers dressed in camouflage , though they probably did n't have to worry about spooking the snakes			2
they would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy , tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the @entity8			1
' it 's advantage - snake , ' mechanical engineer @entity96 concluded after slashing his way through a quarter - mile of scratchy sawgrass , dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the @entity22 , which is about 50 miles southeast of @entity103 and is supervised by the @entity104			0
@entity96 , of @entity105 , and friend @entity106 of @entity107 , a statistician in computer security , holstered large knives and pistols on their hips , so they 'd be ready for any python that crossed their path			0
the snakes can grow to more than 20 feet in length			1
@entity96 battles through thick brush in search for @entity5 pythons , also described as the ' zombies of the @entity8 ' the most useful tool they had , though , was the key fob to their car			1
@entity106 wanted to know that they had n't wandered too far into the wilderness , so @entity96 clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush			0
the recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies : a gunshot to the brain , or decapitation to reduce the threat			1
( @entity137 does n't approve of the latter method , though			0
) pythons are kind of the zombies of the @entity8 , though their infestation is less deadly to humans			1
the snakes have no natural predators , they can eat anything in their way , they can reproduce in large numbers and they do n't belong here			0
@entity3 currently prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets , and federal law bans the importation and interstate sale of the species			0
wildlife experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg			0
@entity3 is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world , said @entity169 , dean of research for the @entity15 's @entity171			0
careful lookout : another hunter , @entity173 , uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in @entity3 since 2000 , according to the conservation commission			2
it 's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands			0
officials hope the competition will help rid the @entity8 of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to @entity3 's native wildlife			1
@entity96 and @entity106 emerged from the @entity8 empty - handed saturday , but they planned to return sunday , hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat - seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees			1
@entity106 still deemed the hunt a success			0
' for me , i take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here			0
it 's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment , ' she said			0
on the trail : @entity96 ( right ) and @entity106 ( left ) head into the @entity8 in the search of pythons			1

snakes can grow to 20 feet in length and recommended killing method is a gunshot to the head
11 pythons have been killed during the first three days of the hunt
