motorists may soon be able to direct the headlamps of their car with their eyes , according to car manufacturer @entity4			1
the company has revealed it is developing eye - tracking technology that will automatically adjust the direction and intensity of headlights to match the driver 's gaze			1
the system uses an in - car camera that focuses on the drivers head with infrared sensors to detect movement and calculate the motorist 's line of sight			1
@entity4 's new eye - tracking system will direct the car headlights in the direction that the motorist is looking			1
the system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver 's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night - time conditions @entity4 - which sells its vehicles under the brand @entity33 in some countries and is owned by @entity35 - insists that the technology will automatically compensate should a driver be distracted or look away from the road			1
the company added it is still currently developing the system but hopes to introduce it to vehicles as its third - generation of intelligent lighting systems in the coming years			1
the system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver 's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night - time conditions			1
the headlights adjust to match the driver 's gaze both vertically and horizontally			1
even if the driver is momentarily distracted and takes their eyes of the road , the lights will continue illuminating in the direction of travel			2
this will be combined with sensors outside the car that will detect daylight levels , turning on the headlights automatically when the vehicle enters a tunnel			1
@entity4 said the lights will also adjust to different road and weather conditions			2
a forward - facing camera mounted behind the rear - view mirror can also detect the proximity of headlamps or rear lights of other vehicles			2
this allows the vehicle to automatically adjust the beam to preventing dazzling other users by reducing the intensity of the beam			1
a matrix of leds in the headlights additionally mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles , while keeping the rest of the road illuminated			1
engineers have also developed new adaptive lighting that combines with the eye - tracking system to make seeing on the roads at night easier and safer			0

@entity138 , director of lighting technology at @entity33 , said the eye - tracking technology was still under development but they had overcome many problems			2
he said it has been designed to prevent it from jerking around as a driver 's attention moves from one part of the road to another			2
a forward - facing camera mounted behind the rear - view mirror can also detect the proximity of headlamps or rear lights of other vehicles , and will automatically adjust the headlight beam to avoid dazzle a matrix of leds in the headlights additionally mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles , while keeping the rest of the road illuminated from march 2018 every new car sold in the @entity163 will legally have to be equipped with @entity165 technology			1
this will consist of a ' black box ' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help			0
this box is also fitted with a gps sensor so it can send the car 's precise location to the control room			0
the technology contains a mobile phone - like sim card designed to transmit the vehicle ’s location to emergency services in the event of a crash			0
it is fitted inside a ' black box ' built into the vehicle			0
an sos button near the dashboard , linked to a sim card , allows drivers to call 999 quickly			0
and if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car ’s location - as well as its unique vehicle id number			0
' to overcome this problem , we have successfully developed a sophisticated delay algorithm which ensures a suitably flowing movement for the light cone			0
' we ’ve been pursuing this concept of controlling the direction and intensity of light based on where the driver is looking for around two years			0
' @entity4 / @entity33 's @entity209 has been developing the eye - tracking technology with the @entity212 in @entity213			1
many of @entity4 's models , including the @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 , already carry its first generation adapted forward lighting technology			2
the eye - tracking system will be combined with this system in future models , a spokesman said			0
however , they were not able to say exactly when it might be introduced as it is still in development			0
mr @entity138 said : ' another major benefit is that the eye - tracker does n’t have to be individually calibrated for a particular driver			0
' the system works perfectly with anyone behind the wheel , no matter what their size			0
' the more we understand the benefits of this technology , the more intensively we push ahead with our joint project			0
' @entity242 , a spokesman for the @entity243 , said the technology had the potential to make driving at night safer			0
he said : ' motorists often find driving at night more demanding			0
' in fact , @entity243 research shows that older drivers in particular , find driving in the dark uncomfortable with 93 % of those over 65 saying they actively avoid doing so			0
' anything that can be done to make driving at night safer for every driver , regardless of age , has to be seen as a positive step forward			0
' when driving on very bendy roads headlamp beams are not always aligned with the next direction the vehicle needs to take so this development should prove very beneficial in this type of situation			0
' the automatic anti-dazzle technology is also impressive as being temporarily blinded by an oncoming vehicle can be extremely dangerous			0
' @entity4 says its new led @entity267 will deactivate parts of the headlight beam to avoid dazzling other drivers , shown in the image on the left , while keeping the rest of the road fully illuminated			1
the image on the right shows how headlights without the system can dazzle a motorist travelling in the opposite direction @entity4 's @entity282 + adaptive front lighting technology uses a forward - facing camera to detect the road conditions ahead and adjust the shape and intensity of the beam , as shown in the diagram above @entity4 's system uses an internal camera and infrared sensors track the driver 's gaze 50 times a second			1

@entity4 / @entity33 hope to introduce the technology to vehicles in future years
the system uses in - car camera and infrared sensors to track driver 's gaze
headlights automatically adjust to follow the focus of the motorists sight
the technology will compensate when drivers are distracted or look away
system will detect oncoming vehicles and reduce intensity to avoid dazzle
leds closest to oncoming traffic deactivate but rest of road is illuminated
