it 's a mystery worthy of @entity1			2
a tiny island in the @entity3 which appears on a range of maps seems to have disappeared without a trace			1
@entity8 scientists who went in search of @entity10 - which appears midway between @entity8 and the @entity12 - governed @entity11 on @entity13 among other world maps - found nothing but sea when they arrived			1
the @entity17 appears to identify the sizeable phantom island in the @entity19 as @entity20 , and weather maps used by the @entity22 , an @entity8 maritime research vessel also say it exists			2
a team of @entity8 geologists went in search of the island , and discovered it was n't there the first recorded instance of the phantom island was believed to be on a map in 2000 , when it was claimed to have been seen on @entity39 maps based on data from @entity42 satellite images			1
the @entity44 group of amateur radio enthusiasts , run by @entity46 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , claimed in april 2000 that they had seen the images on the @entity39 website - but there was open water in other sources , such as the 1999 edition of the @entity17			0
a @entity39 expert reportedly told the group that the maps in that area were by @entity59 and known to contain problems			1
the @entity61 said today that human error was most likely to have caused the mistake			2
the society ’s president @entity64 told the @entity66 that it is still possible the island does exist nearby - and that someone may have found an island but ‘ put it in the wrong location ’			2
but when the ship , which was tasked with identifying fragments of the @entity8 continental crust submerged in the @entity19 , steamed to where it was supposed to be there was nothing there			0
the island supposedly sits in an area of very deep sea , making its existence something of a geological oddity that researchers wanted to investigate			1
however , when they got there , it was nowhere to be found			2
' we wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres ( 4,620 feet ) in that area - very deep , ' said dr @entity97 , of the @entity98 , after the 25 - day voyage			1
' it 's on @entity13 and other maps so we went to check and there was no island			1
' how did it find its way onto the maps ? we just do n't know , but we plan to follow up and find out			0
' the island 's appearance on @entity28 perhaps should have sparked suspicions			0
compared with nearby islands on which the undulations of ground are visible , @entity10 appears merely as a dark blob			1
look for yourself : this map embedded from @entity28 maps shows the location of the phantom island @entity121 satellite images are not updated in real time and in most cases they are several months or years old although the service provides high - resolution aerial or satellite images for most urban areas all over the world , most of the world 's publicly current satellite imagery is over 5 years old			1
because of this , many areas where there have been recent changes are not accurately covered			0
and not all areas on the satellite images are covered in the same resolution - less populated areas usually get less detail			0
with the introduction of an easily pannable and searchable mapping and satellite imagery tool , @entity28 's mapping engine prompted a surge of interest in satellite imagery			0
although @entity28 uses the word satellite , most of the high - resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 – 1500 feet rather than from satellites ; most of the rest of the imagery is in fact from satellites news of the invisible island sparked debate on social media , with tweeter @entity164 outpointing that @entity10 is also on @entity165 as well as @entity166 ' but it disappears up close '			1
on www.abovetopsecret.com , discussions were robust with one poster claiming he had confirmed with the @entity12 hydrographic office that it was indeed a phantom island and was supposed to have been removed from charts in 1979			0
another claimed : ' many mapmakers put in deliberate but unobtrusive and non-obvious " mistakes " into their maps so that they can know when somebody steals the map data			1
' @entity28 was not immediately available for comment			0
but the @entity121 product manager for @entity8 and @entity183 told the @entity184 a variety of authoritative public and commercial sources were used in building maps			0
' the world is a constantly changing place , and keeping on top of these changes is a never - ending endeavour , ' @entity188 told the newspaper			0
the closest landmass to the invisible island is the @entity197 , a @entity12 archipelago of uninhabited coral sand cays			0
mission : dr @entity97 , of the @entity98 , said after a 25 - day voyage that ' navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres ( 4,620 feet ) in that area - very deep ' video : @entity209 scientist @entity208 talks about the quest to find the mysterious island			2

@entity10 shows up on a range of maps and *online* services
its existence in an area of deep sea would have been geological oddity
but when researchers went in search of it they found nothing there
it could be a deliberate mistake entered as mapmaker 's ' *watermark* '
