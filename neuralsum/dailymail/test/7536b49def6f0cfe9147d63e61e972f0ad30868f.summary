back in january 2012 @entity0 took three promising young boys , all brothers , from their home in @entity3 , @entity4 , after watching them beat the mighty @entity5 in a youth tournament			1
there was a bit of a fuss made of the move at the time , with brothers @entity12 , plus twins @entity14 and @entity15 , compared with the trio of @entity18 siblings who created history when they played together in a first - team game for @entity21 against @entity22 wednesday on october 22 , 1988			2
on wednesday , @entity23 , the eldest of the three children , who left @entity4 ’s academy to make the 100 - mile round trip , three or fours times a week , in their mum @entity28 to @entity0 ’s @entity30 training base , turns 17			1
he is earmarked first team potential			0
@entity0 's kids have been buoyed by @entity34 's insistence on promoting young players at the club @entity37 ( right ) celebrates scoring in the @entity39 final first leg victory over @entity40 in an environment where the competition is fierce and the temptation is to spend big in the transfer market , @entity34 made the surprise announcement that he will promote one of @entity0 ’s youngsters next season			1
@entity49 , a powerful , muscular presence in @entity0 ’s development teams , will be with the first - team squad at the start of pre-season			1
those with an intimate knowledge of @entity23 ’s progress at @entity0 over the past three seasons believe this first - year scholar is not far behind			1
a week ago @entity23 returned to the national conscience when @entity61 claimed he was ‘ better than any other @entity62 left back ’ after @entity0 became @entity64 youth champions in @entity65			1
among a group of players that includes @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , at @entity73 level alone , plus @entity0 ’s first - choice left back @entity75 , it was certainly an audacious claim by the former @entity78 striker			2
@entity79 is the last player to come through @entity0 's youth ranks and become a first - team regular @entity79 broke into the @entity0 team in 1999 , but the club has been unable to unearth a stellar talent since he moved through the junior teams at pace , settling at left back after spells as a winger , and is one of the most level - headed young players at the club			1
at his old school in @entity4 , he was head boy			0
when he travelled to @entity93 , @entity94 , for a @entity96 qualifier with @entity73 last october , he revealed that one of his motivations was to stay ahead of his kid brothers in the family pecking order			0
‘ they keep me on my toes and they ’re after me , so i need to keep working hard to stay ahead of them , ’ he admitted			0
‘ it ’s great to have all three of us at @entity0			0
we have played together since we were young , so hopefully that will happen at senior level one day			0
’ they are a remarkable football family , with dad @entity111 well known in the parks game in @entity4			0
his eldest son @entity113 was a professional with @entity4			0
@entity23 is a promising young player on the @entity115 ' books , along with two of his brothers the young left back is forging a bright reputation for himself and was recently hailed as a star by @entity61 @entity23 beats @entity123 's @entity122 to the ball during a @entity126 match last week he was in @entity127 , @entity65 , joining in with his team - mates when they poured a bucket of ice over their coach @entity132 as @entity0 ’s under 19 team celebrated becoming @entity135 champions			1
at the time of the final , which @entity0 won 3 - 2 against @entity139 , after beating @entity140 4 - 0 in the semi-final , the defender was playing three years up on his age group			2
he is a big talent			0
on monday evening he returned to @entity0 ’s under 18 side , playing left back as they won the first leg of the @entity39 final against @entity40 at the @entity147 3 - 1			2
last year , when he had only just turned 16 , the academy scholar scored in the thrilling 7 - 6 aggregate victory in the @entity39 triumph over @entity151			0
despite the progress of @entity23 , along with many other young players in @entity0 ’s lavish academy system , there is a good deal of scepticism about their chances of making the first team			1
two years ago @entity161 was regarded among the most talented teenagers in the country when he spent a season on loan with @entity166 in the championship			0
@entity34 , who was about to quit @entity168 to return to @entity0 , was compelled to make a flying visit to @entity73 to watch @entity170 in the @entity96 play - off final against @entity172 in 2013			1
@entity173 has been guaranteed a chance to make his mark in the @entity0 first - team squad but @entity161 ( centre ) shows that @entity0 's young players must take their chance when it comes @entity161 was the big hope at @entity0 's academy , but he did not shine when @entity34 made a special trip to watch him when he played for @entity166 in the @entity96 play - off final ( right )			1
now he is on loan at @entity185 on the big day @entity170 disappointed , missing an opportunity to make an impression on the incoming @entity0 manager before his return to @entity191 football had been officially confirmed			0
@entity170 had been the big hope in academy circles , the one player @entity0 ’s academy director @entity195 hoped could break the run , stretching back to 1999 , since a youth - team graduate became a first - team regular			1
they need no reminders that man was captain @entity79			0
still , it is also something of a myth that @entity34 will not give youth a chance because he won the 2004 @entity207 final with @entity208 by playing three players from the club ’s academy system			1
goalkeeper @entity212 , central defender @entity213 and his partner at the back @entity216 had all progressed through the youth ranks at @entity218 do @entity219			0
the challenge for @entity23 next season , when he becomes a second - year scholar , is to prove to the manager that he can take his chance during impromptu training sessions with the first team			2
@entity75 and @entity226 are the established left backs in the squad , fighting it out for a starting position each week in @entity0 ’s first team			2
as every player at @entity0 soon discovers , they can not be around forever .			2

@entity23 building a strong reputation in @entity0 's youth system
the young defender has been earmarked as a future first - team player
@entity0 have not produced a *homegrown* regular since @entity79
but @entity34 insists he will give youth players a chance
@entity173 has been guaranteed a place in the squad
