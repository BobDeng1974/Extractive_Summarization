by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:52 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 23 september 2013 jibe : shadow chancellor @entity3 used his keynote speech on the economy to crack a joke about @entity8 's holiday snaps politics is often portrayed as an exercise in proving who is the alpha male who stands out from the crowd			1
but @entity3 took the battle to a new level today when he appeared to tease @entity8 about only needing a small towel to preserve his modesty on the beach			1
the shadow chancellor was greeted with nervous laughter and bemused stares of incomprehension from delegates at the @entity24 conference			1
the prime minister was snapped on a @entity27 beach last month performing the time - honoured dancing of trying to change out of his trunks while maintaining a degree of decency and dignity			1
having deftly completed the tricky manoeuvre , mr @entity8 then went on to remove his trusty polo shirt to reveal an ample - and very red - torso			2
delivering his keynote speech on @entity24 's economy strategy , mr @entity3 today took a detour to cast judgement on the pm 's physique			1
even wife @entity43 , sitting in the audience , appeared taken aback , managing only a thin - lipped smile throughout			0
the shadow chancellor was met with cries of ' no ' after asking the @entity24 conference if anyone felt sorry for mr @entity8 when he was pictured putting his shorts on under his @entity51 towel			1
mr @entity3 joked during his speech at the @entity67 conference : ' did n't you feel a little sorry for our prime minister this summer ? did n't you ? ' back in august , on the beach , changing into his swimming trunks , behind that @entity51 towel , captured on cameras , unflattering pictures spread across the national press			1
' i 've been there , i know what it 's like			0
' measuring up : mr @entity81 ' wife , @entity43 , had remarked at what good shape mr @entity8 was in heavyweight : @entity3 takes a tumble during the @entity87 football match mr @entity3 went on : ' let me let you into a little secret			2
when @entity43 saw the pictures she said , rather pointedly i thought , she said that for a 46 - year old man @entity8 looked rather slim			2
' slim ? who on @entity93 can she have been comparing him to ? ' i just thought for a prime minister it was a surprisingly small towel			0
' let us all agree after the last three years the sooner @entity8 throws in the towel the better			2
' life 's a beach : in the latest photo opportunity @entity3 and @entity101 were pictured on @entity103 apparently reading his leader 's speech @entity106 copied @entity8 to be pictured on the beach - but kept his trousers on			1
the @entity24 leader posed on the pebbles on @entity67 beach with wife @entity101 , in just the latest photo opportunity for the couple			0
@entity101 has promised to take to the ‘ barricades ’ in the general election battle as she vowed not to just stand silently next to husband @entity3 in a nice dress			0
party strategists plan to put mrs @entity101 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election			0
but she has vowed to break with convention and speak out publicly about why she thinks mr @entity106 should be prime minister			0
speaking at a @entity24 event in @entity67 , she said : ‘ i wanted to come along to say a few words because i thought , “ if i do n't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you 'll know about me this year is the make of the dress i wear for @entity3 's speech on tuesday ”			0
‘ that 's a side of me the media tend to focus on and i thought it was quite important to reassure you that i am in fact more than a dress			0
