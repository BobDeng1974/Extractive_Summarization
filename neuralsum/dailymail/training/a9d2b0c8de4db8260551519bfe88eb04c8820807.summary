by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 3 november 2012 ninety years ago this month , @entity2 archaeologist @entity1 discovered the tomb of @entity4 and set in motion a chain of events that brought scandal , infighting and rumours of a famous curse all the way from @entity13 back to @entity14 and @entity15 – known to television audiences as @entity17			1
as he peered into a hole in a door of the boy king ’s tomb , his financial backer , the 5th @entity24 and owner of @entity26 , asked : ‘ can you see anything ? ’ ‘ i see wonderful things , ’ came the famous reply			1
within , they found treasures beyond their wildest imagining : thousands of statues , vases , paintings and the ornate sarcophagus in which the king ’s mummified body lay , all glittering with gold and precious jewels			1
somehow they had survived for 33 centuries , safe from robbers who had plundered all the other tombs in the @entity46			2
it was the greatest archaeological find of all time			2
taking treasures : @entity2 archaeologist @entity1 , left , and @entity50 , master of @entity15 in the chamber inside @entity4 's tomb as a @entity2 adventurer , @entity1 should be up there with @entity54 and @entity55			1
instead , his reputation is marred by accusations that he turned grave robber , pinching dozens of items for himself and @entity50 , and that no one actually knows what the tomb looked like when he found it because his reports on the excavation are a pack of lies			1
according to @entity1 ’s story , he found the tomb ’s entrance on november 4 , 1922 and cabled @entity50 to sail from @entity72			2
@entity1 waited until his backer arrived before they went down the steps on november 26			2
he poked a hole in the door , held a candle to test for noxious fumes and peered in to see piles of lavish ornaments , shimmering with gold			0
@entity1 ’s notes record that they then resealed the hole so they could fulfil their legal duty of telling @entity13 ’s director - general of antiquities			1
but did they really ? @entity1 and @entity50 knew the find would put them in the history books and i do n’t believe for a second that they did n’t explore the tomb that night			2
there ’s plenty of evidence that far from resealing the hole , @entity1 enlarged it to let himself , @entity50 and @entity50 ’s daughter @entity98 climb in			0
the @entity24 ’s half - brother @entity99 wrote in his journal that they confessed ‘ under the strictest promise of secrecy ’ that they went through to the inner chamber			1
it seems they also removed small souvenirs that night , such as figurines or jewellery – anything bigger would have been noticed by workmen outside			0
their pockets must have been stuffed as they returned to the @entity115 in @entity116			0
but one evening ’s pilfering does n’t explain the sheer number of @entity119 in museums and collections round the world			0
evidence has emerged that points to a quite different story			0
some experts think @entity1 found the tomb several months before he told @entity50 , giving ample time to explore it and sneak out dozens of items			2
tv set : @entity15 in @entity130 made famous as @entity131 's @entity17 what would @entity132 say : the @entity13 treasures currently at display at @entity26 - or the @entity137 family 's @entity17 to the rest of us - are stolen , according to @entity13 authorities @entity1 , a knowledgable dealer in antiquities , had helped @entity50 amass a significant collection of @entity13 tomb artefacts			1
they worked together on several digs before gaining a concession in the @entity46 in 1914			0
during work in 1922 , his men reached a spot inches from where the tomb ’s entrance would be found when @entity1 told them to move some distance away			2
had he found the entrance ? if so , he had good reason to keep it under his hat			0
@entity1 claimed there were clear signs that robbers broke seals on the tomb shortly after @entity4 was laid to rest in @entity163 , stealing perfume bottles and disturbing the careful array			1
this would have been very helpful , because under the terms of his licence to dig , his team was entitled to keep half of any treasure if he could prove the tomb had been broken into before their arrival			2
but if robbers had found their way in , why did they leave behind so many priceless golden objects ? @entity179 , an employee at the 1922 dig , admitted in 1947 that he saw @entity1 break open a door and relock it , with an antique seal , but no one paid much attention at the time			0
as part of his evidence of previous break - ins , @entity1 showed a photo of a footprint he claimed was made by a robber , but modern experts say it does n’t resemble an ancient @entity13 sandal			1
in fact , it appears to be the sole of a modern shoe – much like the type @entity1 himself wore			0
@entity50 was optimistic the @entity13 authorities would agree he was entitled to half the treasure – but in april 1923 , he died of septicaemia from an infected mosquito bite			1
he had owned the concession , and arguments sprang up			0
the director - general of antiquities wanted to retain it all for @entity13			1
one thing was for sure : @entity1 was n’t entitled to anything			0
portrait : a wooden effigy of the young @entity4 there was talk back in 1923 that items had been illegally removed			1
@entity1 was nearly caught in the act when @entity13 inspectors found a painted bust packed into a @entity218 box , as if waiting to be sneaked away			1
somehow he managed to talk his way out of trouble			0
@entity1 began quietly distributing gifts from the tomb , with @entity225 oil baron @entity223 receiving a gold ring			2
he gave an amulet to a fellow @entity228 , sir @entity229			0
then , when @entity1 died in 1939 , dozens of valuable and important items from the tomb were found in his house , including a shabti [ figurine ] and a glass head - rest with a gold band			1
his looting was now an open secret			0
@entity50 ’s wife @entity239 became convinced that he had died as a result of the ‘ @entity241 ’ , especially after several others associated with the dig died in the years immediately after the tomb was disturbed			1
she begged @entity1 to remove the collection of @entity13 artefacts from @entity26 and he sold most to the @entity247 in @entity248			1
remaining treasures were packed away in cupboards at @entity26 and forgotten			2
in 2010 , the @entity247 agreed to return to @entity13 19 antiquities , including a lapis - lazuli sphinx and a bronze figure of a dog with a golden collar			1
the @entity247 is not alone			0
egyptologist @entity256 visited the @entity257 in 2010 and found a shabti with @entity4 ’s throne name written on it , which he claims could only be from the tomb			1
two golden hawks ’ heads were found in @entity263 , part of a collar that broke as it was removed from the mummy ’s neck			2
the story goes they were a gift from @entity1 to his dentist			0
he seems to have been very generous with his plunder			0
and what of @entity26 ? in 1987 , the 7th @entity24 unlocked a door that had been closed for many years and found pigeonholes full of packages which turned out to contain finds from the 5th @entity24 ’s excavations			1
he dusted them down and put them on display			0
recently , as @entity17 ’s success has drawn attention to the house , authorities in @entity13 have said all the @entity4 antiquities were stolen and asked for the return of any original items at @entity26			1
the @entity24 argues that he does not have any , only replicas , and that the other antiquities were obtained fairly			1
it ’s never been definitively established where the 5th @entity24 ’s @entity4 souvenirs ended up			1
the fact remains that @entity1 made a phenomenal discovery in the @entity46 in 1922			0
the ancient solemnity of the tomb gets under your skin			2
it inspired me to write about the discovery of the tomb in a new novel set in the @entity305			1
so perhaps , on the 90th anniversary , we should proclaim it as a great @entity2 success story			0
@entity1 was certainly a giant of @entity311			0
as it turns out , however , he was an untruthful giant with rather sticky fingers			0
@entity0 ’s novel @entity316 is out now ( @entity317 , £ 7.99 )			0
the affair will be published in may 2013 .			0

@entity320 discovered the tomb of @entity4 in @entity13 90 years ago with his financial backer , lord @entity323
