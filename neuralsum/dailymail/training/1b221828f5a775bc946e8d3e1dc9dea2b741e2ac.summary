by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 26 july 2013 astonishing photos showing @entity3 soldiers performing ' @entity5 ' - style concert parties at a @entity6 have emerged after nearly 70 years			1
the images depict the incredibly elaborate theatre productions the men of @entity10 put on to keep up the morale of the 4,000 prisoners during @entity13			1
the sets , costumes , performances and concert programmes were of almost professional standards , with a great deal of time , effort and skill clearly going into creating them			1
costumes : this picture shows the effort that went in to the costume and set design for the performances productions : @entity31 ( left ) compiled images of the productions during his time at @entity35 in a scrapbook ( right ) which has emerged after 70 years the theatrical and musical concerts were held in a barn - like building the men called the ' @entity41 ' , as the camp had once been an @entity44 - a camp for officers			1
many tons of earth were transported and stamped down methodically to form a sloping floor in the hall to give the audience an unobstructed view			2
the photos show servicemen wearing women 's clothing , playing female roles in classics like @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity60			2
they also highlight a sizeable orchestra playing saxophones , trumpets , tubas and guitars , tackling numbers like @entity68 's @entity67 and music by @entity70 that had been banned by the @entity71			2
@entity72 : @entity73 and his @entity75 band in 1944 dressing up : two of the men convincingly dressed up as @entity79 ladies in productions at @entity35 the pictures made up a scrapbook dedicated to the ' @entity83 ' and was compiled by @entity31 , a leading light of the movement			1
he sent the book home to his parents in january 1945			1
it recently turned up on sale at a market stall in south west @entity79 and was bought by the current owner			0
he is now selling the book at auction in @entity95 , @entity96 , with a pre-sale estimate of Â£ 500			1
@entity10 was located outside @entity98 and held 4,000 ncos and warrant officers who persuaded their @entity102 guards to help them with their theatrical hobbies			0
performance : a typical @entity79 home scene - on stage at the @entity107 in 1944 posters : a stalag 383 programme for the production of @entity58 - signed by @entity31 ( left ) and a flyer for one of the shows by the @entity73 and his @entity75 band in 1944 ( right ) as well as theatrical shows , the company also had a dance band led by @entity118 and a ' @entity75 ' that was conducted by @entity119			1
@entity120 , of @entity122 's auction house , said : ' the whole book provides an almost surreal impression of @entity126 life in the camp			1
' each production is featured with a remarkably - almost professionally - produced programme , with a typed cast list , and stage photographs			0
entertainment : a clinching moment between two men , one convincingly dressed up as an @entity79 lady , during a show at @entity35 ' looking at the photographs , one might think it was the @entity138 rather than a pow camp			1
' while other @entity141 were digging tunnels and doing anything to escape , it seems the inmates at @entity10 were having a jolly good time of it			0
' and because there were no women in the camp , the many female roles taken in the productions had to be fulfilled by the @entity126 themselves , and judging from the many photos , they managed to carry them off with aplomb			2
' the history of the camp bears out the lifestyle they enjoyed			0
it was almost exclusively given over to @entity158 , and as anyone in the forces knows , a band of @entity158 will always get the best for themselves			0
' in the case of 383 , it appears the @entity102 had despaired of the various antics of @entity158 at other camps in getting out of work duties , so they were almost exclusively sent to 383 and given the " fur lined " treatment			0
' instead of being held in draconian conditions , the inmates enjoyed small dormitory huts housing 14 or fewer			0
' they enjoyed sports like cricket , which bemused the @entity102 , walking and the theatre , which was particularly popular			2
' one inmate wrote home that he was " 14 pounds heavier than when he joined up " and many of the @entity102 guards helped out their @entity3 counterparts , and gave them information on the progress of the war			0
' events like @entity13 carry with them many different stories			0
the accepted version of @entity126 life has been borne out in @entity190 blockbusters like " @entity191 " and films like " @entity193 "			0
' certainly for the men at these camps life was unbelievably tough , but clearly from the scrapbook of 383 , this was not the story for everyone banged up by the @entity102			2
' the sale is on august 21			0
set design : the @entity126 's put a staggering amount of work in to the sets for the performances			1
