@entity0 has handed rookie defender @entity1 and midfielder @entity2 their @entity3 debuts in a maverick first team selection against @entity5			1
@entity6 has been hit by defensive injuries before the opening game with @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all missing			2
and that has led him to give 20 - year - old @entity1 his debut at centre back with 21 - year - old @entity2 in the right wing back role			2
i wo n’t change the system because i ’ve instilled it into these players			0
it is easier to continue with the system than to change it			0
’ @entity2 spent last season on loan at @entity58 and @entity59 while @entity1 also spent time with @entity58 after a spell at @entity61			0
both impressed the new coach on @entity3 's @entity65 pre season tour but their @entity67 debuts pose a big step up as @entity6 plays a wildcard with his first ever @entity70 impact : @entity1 has caught the eye with a string of impressive displays during pre-season out : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) are both out , posing problems for @entity6 's new 3 - 5 - 2 system all smiles : the @entity3 manager remains confident that his team will hit the ground running , despite injuries			1

@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all missing through injury for @entity3
@entity0 has thrown in rookie @entity1 for his @entity3 debut rather than altering his *favoured* 3 - 5 - 2 formation
@entity2 also starts in his first game against @entity5 at @entity90
