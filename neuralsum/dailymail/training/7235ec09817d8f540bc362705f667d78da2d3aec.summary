‘ i like to get on with people , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n't like to leave people with a sour taste in their mouth			0
i suspect grabbing someone 's breasts for 15 seconds would leave a sour taste in their mouth			1
‘ what would this be saying to her , “ your breasts are going to fall off if you smoke ? ” ’ he added : ‘ there has to be a realisation people can just jump on the bandwagon and have a crack at someone			2

grabbed her t * * *			0
my recollection was everyone in the team would have known			0
‘ this was office gossip to some extent			0
my feeling was , if you think back to that time , the idea we ’d call the police and say ‘ @entity1 grabbed ( the woman ’s ) t * * * ’ , would n’t have gone anywhere			1
