' symbolism : president @entity2 said that he was happy to return to the garden at president @entity14 ' house which he saw the first time that he went to @entity9 in 2008 when he was a senator taking action : president @entity2 brought this tree over from @entity3 and the two leaders worked together to plant it in president @entity14 ' garden symbolic : @entity2 told the story of @entity93 and the carob tree , a famous parable from the @entity97 text the @entity96 , and said that it represents the two country 's past and future friendship seeking to alter a perception among many @entity9 that his government has been less supportive of @entity9 than previous @entity3 administrations , @entity2 declared the @entity3 - @entity9 alliance ' eternal			1
' ' it is forever , ' he said to applause as @entity9 and @entity3 flags fluttered in a steady breeze under clear , sunny skies			2
even before leaving the airport for @entity112 , @entity2 offered a vivid display of the @entity3 commitment to @entity9 security by visiting a missile battery that is part of @entity9 's @entity118 defense from militant rocket attacks			1
the @entity3 has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the system with @entity9			2
enjoying the welcome : mr @entity2 was greeted by a children 's choir @entity2 and @entity124 toured the battery , brought to the airport for the occasion			0

' let me say as clearly as i can : the @entity3 stands with the @entity9 because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with @entity9 , ' @entity2 said			1
' we stand together because peace must come to the @entity26 , ' he added			0
' for even as we are clear - eyed about the difficulty , we will never lose sight of the vision of an @entity9 at peace with its neighbors			0
' ' the @entity3 stands with @entity9 because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with @entity9			2
public events : the itinerary is filled with joint press conferences where mr @entity2 and @entity9 leaders will make it clear that they are united against countries like @entity59 and @entity150 commemoration : president @entity2 signed the guestbook at mr @entity14 ' home during the tour signing off : president @entity2 's note in the guestbook said that it was an honor for him to visit @entity9 again ' we stand together because we share a common story patriots			1
' our alliance is eternal , it is forever			0
' in their personal interactions , president @entity2 said that it was ' good to see you , brother ' to president @entity14			1
to prime minister @entity124 , he joked that it is ' good to see you			0
. and it 's good to get away from @entity170 '			0
@entity124 , who sparred frequently with @entity2 over the course of the @entity3 president 's first term , was lavish in his praise for the president			1
reaching the people : during his remarks , president @entity2 stressed the importance of securing a safe future for @entity9 children ' thank you for standing by @entity9 at this time of historic change in the @entity7 , ' he said			1
' thank you for unequivocally affirming @entity9 's sovereign right to defend itself by itself against any threat			0
' although preventing @entity59 from developing a nuclear weapon is a top priority of both @entity9 and the @entity3 , @entity124 and @entity2 have differed in the past on precisely how to achieve both ends			1
@entity9 repeatedly has threatened to take military action should @entity59 appear to be on the verge of obtaining a bomb			0
the @entity3 has pushed for more time to allow diplomacy and economic penalties to run their course , though @entity2 insists military action is an option			2
@entity2 , who joked that he was ' getting away from @entity170 ' by visiting @entity9 , planned to visit several cultural and religious sites aimed at showing his understanding of the deep and ancient connections between the @entity97 people and the land that is now @entity9			2
he will also meet @entity203 president @entity202 in the @entity204 and travel to @entity205 before returning home on saturday			0
but on an itinerary filled more with symbolism than substance , @entity2 's main focus is on an @entity9 that is increasingly wary of developments in @entity150 and @entity59			2
adding yet another dimension to the trip , @entity2 landed amid new questions about the @entity150 regime 's possible use of chemical weapons			0
@entity2 has declared the use , deployment or transfer of the weapons would be a ' red line ' for possible military intervention by the @entity3 in the @entity150 conflict			2
ahead of @entity2 's visit , authorities in @entity9 said they believed that chemical weapons may have been recently used in @entity150 , although @entity3 officials have said they had no evidence to support the @entity150 regime 's claims that rebels were responsible for a chemical attack			1
welcoming : much of the trip will be focused on how president @entity2 and prime minister @entity124 interact as their relationship is known to be frosty headed down the path together : @entity9 is looking for the @entity3 to take a firm stance against @entity59 and their fledgling nuclear program as it is seen as the biggest threat to the jewish state matching moves : both the president and the prime minister were recently re-elected so there is a need for them to work out their personal difficulties and find a way to collaborate proud pals : prime minister @entity124 posted this picture to his personal @entity256 account even though @entity3 officials have set expectations low and previewed no major policy pronouncements , a clear measure of the success of @entity2 's @entity9 trip will be how much he is able to reverse negative perceptions			1
the centerpiece of the visit will be a speech to @entity9 university students on thursday , during which @entity2 will again renew @entity3 security pledges to @entity9 as it seeks to counter threats from @entity59 , protect its people from any spillover in the @entity150 civil war and maintain its shaky peace accord with an @entity273 that is now controlled by the @entity274			1
@entity2 will make an almost perfunctory visit to the cash - strapped @entity203 's headquarters in the @entity204 town of @entity279 , where he will meet the embattled @entity202 and assure him that an independent @entity203 state remains a @entity3 foreign policy and national security priority			2
the downed ' @entity283 ' : president @entity2 's armored limo broke down in @entity37 this morning as it was headed to the airport after the driver mistakenly put gas in the tank instead of diesel big mistake : the 18 - foot car has an tank that holds 6.5 liters of diesel , and does not work when given gas ca n't take it : the car had to be picked up on a tow truck and it is unclear whether the problem was quickly fixed @entity3 made : the car that president @entity2 drove off in after speaking at president @entity14 ' house was definitely an incarnation of ' @entity283 ' given it 's @entity302 license plates and 5 - inch - thick doors as @entity9 warmly greeted @entity2 , @entity305 held several small protests in the @entity204 and @entity134			1
demonstrators in the @entity308 - ruled @entity134 burned posters of @entity2 and @entity3 flags , accusing the @entity3 of being biased toward @entity9			1
in the @entity204 , about 200 activists erected about a dozen tents in an area just outside of @entity112 to draw attention to @entity9 's policy of building settlements			0
the tents were pitched in @entity317 , a strategically located area where @entity9 has said it plans on building thousands of homes			0
the @entity3 has harshly criticized the plan			0
@entity9 forces have swiftly dismantled similar encampments built by @entity305 in the past			0
@entity324 , one of the activists , said @entity9 forces surrounded the tent camp but had not moved in			0
despite not coming with any new plan to get the stalled peace process back on track , @entity2 plans to make clear that his administration intends to keep trying to get talks re-launched			0
' to tell the truth , they ca n't stand one another , ' a commentator for @entity9 's @entity337 television said of @entity2 and @entity124 just as @entity338 landed in @entity9 reassurances : president @entity14 said in an interview shortly before @entity2 's arrival that he feels more confident now that the @entity3 will support @entity9 against @entity59 if the ever developed a nuclear weapon being heard : mr @entity2 will spend much of his trip in @entity9 talking with president @entity14 ( left ) and prime minister @entity124 ( right ) bring it in : @entity2 gives big hugs to both @entity14 ( left ) and @entity124 ( right ) @entity2 will close out his @entity7 trip with a 24 - hour stop in @entity205 , an important @entity3 ally , where his focus will be on the violence in @entity150			1
more than 450,000 @entity150 have fled to @entity205 , crowding refugee camps and overwhelming aid organizations			0
in his talks with @entity205 's @entity356 , @entity2 also will try to shore up the country 's fledgling attempts to liberalize its government and stave off an @entity361 - style movement similar to the ones that have taken down leaders elsewhere in the region .			0
