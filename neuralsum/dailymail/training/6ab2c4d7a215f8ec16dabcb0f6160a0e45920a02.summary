by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 22 august 2013 this is the hilarious footage of a very curious penguin trying to gobble up an expensive @entity4 camera			1
when the penguin on the @entity7 caught sight of the camera , he just could not help going in for a closer look , and a firm peck			1
@entity13 photographer @entity12 captured the video while working as a vet in the @entity7			2
leading the charge of the penguins , one brave one comes forwards out of the pack on the beach to approach the camera the curious penguin coyly made his approach towards the camera at first eyeing up the expensive camera , he goes in for a close inspection of the lens , encouraged by his friends his curiosity gets the better of him and he swoops in for a preliminary peck , as the others keep a watch the footage shows the mischievous bird waddle over the camera and nibble it			1
the greedy bird then tries to pick up and eat the small device before giving up and walking off			0
@entity12 said : ' i was expecting them to come in to take a close look			0
i was very surprised when he tried to eat the camera			2
' the previous year the penguins seemed fascinated by their reflections in my camera lens , but clearly they are more mischievous than i thought			2
' the emboldened animal goes for a full - on bite as he tries to take a chunk out of the camera wrestling with the device on the beach , the penguin unsuccessfully tries to eat it with his beak wide open puzzled at his lack of success , the penguin looks disappointed that he has not made any progress ' i spent two days at @entity61 where that sequence was shot , in the evenings the penguins would return to their nests after feeding out at sea and stop to investigate anything unusual in their path			1
' it 's interesting to watch , they look at the camera and then at each other as if to say ' are you going or shall i ? ' ' one is tempted but then walks on			0
his neighbour then ca n't resist and comes in for the kill			0
' despite penguins ' image as only inhabiting ice and snow a million of them come every year to the sandy beaches and sheep paddocks of the @entity7			1
penguins are a big feature on the @entity7			1
its only newspaper is even called @entity87			0
having pecked the camera , the penguin had a quick scout around to see if anyone had caught him in the act @entity12 , 30 , has been a photographer for 14 years and got into photography after falling in love with nature			1
his passion for spending hours watching plants and animals around him drove him to buying his first camera at the age of 16			0
' i have been near - fanatical about wildlife and the natural world since i could crawl			0
the penguin looked the picture of innocence as he waddled away to join the others the cheeky penguin is in good company on the @entity7 as 1million of them head there every year when the camera was not being pecked it was able to catch many of the penguins going about their usual business , such as this one taking a shower ' i 've spent the past 13 years exploring and photographing various wilderness locations , both in the @entity13 and abroad			1
' it was just luck that i had the opportunity to spend some time working in the @entity7 - surely one of the world 's most spectacular wildlife destinations			2
' @entity84 are excellent photographic subjects for they are approachable , colourful , full of character and their upright gait makes them seem so human			0

one cheeky penguin *decided* to have a quick peck at the camera as he was filmed on the @entity7
as many as a million penguins come to nest in the @entity7 every *summer*
