there was a telling moment on wednesday when @entity2 encapsulated @entity4 ’s philosophy by invoking the memory of the country ’s iconic @entity6 - winning no 10			1
‘ to be the best , it ’s not about the flash stuff , it ’s about skill , execution and everything being done at a very high level , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if we take @entity15 as the benchmark , he did n’t get everything right all the time and it was n’t always flash , but he was incredibly consistent in everything he did			1
’ his answer came after @entity22 was left out of the 33 - man squad for the @entity25 series next month , as exclusively revealed by @entity26 nine days ago			1
@entity22 has been one of @entity4 's leading no 10s this season but has been overlooked by @entity28 @entity15 , who kicked @entity4 to @entity6 glory in 2003 , encapsulates @entity4 's philosophy @entity4 will be aiming to win the @entity30 ( left ) and the @entity31 vs @entity32 and @entity33 forwards : @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , @entity45 ( @entity42 ) , @entity46 ( @entity42 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity49 ( @entity38 ) , @entity50 ( @entity44 ) , @entity51 ( @entity44 ) , @entity52 ( @entity38 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , @entity55 ( @entity36 , capt ) , @entity56 ( @entity48 ) , @entity57 ( @entity44 )			1
backs : @entity59 ( @entity36 ) , @entity60 ( @entity44 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity48 ) , @entity64 ( @entity42 ) , @entity65 ( @entity44 ) , @entity66 ( @entity48 ) , @entity67 ( @entity44 ) , @entity68 ( @entity42 ) , @entity69 ( @entity42 ) , @entity70 ( @entity54 ) , @entity71 ( @entity36 ) , a @entity72 ( @entity48 ) , @entity73 ( @entity54 ) , @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , @entity76 ( @entity42 ) , @entity77 ( @entity36 )			2
countless observers , this one included , believe the @entity81 fly - half has greater match - winning credentials than @entity84 , who has been picked as one of the three stand - offs			1
those on the outside crave dashes of magic to ignite @entity4 ’s attack , but the men in charge focus on the sum of several often earthy parts			1
@entity2 said : ‘ game management is one of the key things we look for in our fly - halves			1
ability to execute an accurate kicking game , so you relieve pressure ; if you ’re in the middle of the field , you kick or run			2
‘ if i talk about taking the ball to the line and creating line breaks for other people , i think you look at @entity110			2
goal - kicking is a key area			2
@entity84 probably tops the stats — his kicking has been very , very good			1
then there ’s defence , the ability to stop opponents on the gain line			2
these are all parts of the jigsaw			0
‘ there ’s a package that we need to see , not just from him ( @entity22 ) but from all the players			1
some players have had stand - out games but it ’s about backing that up with another and another , not having a stand - out game then being seven out of 10			0
it needs to be nine out of 10			0
’ @entity2 's decision to pick @entity84 over @entity22 is a conservative and cautious decision @entity110 is the most attacking fly - half out of the three selected for the autumn series @entity135 has kept his place in the squad in spite of his lack of game time at @entity48 oct 26 squad gathers nov 8 @entity4 v @entity142 ( @entity143 ) nov 15 @entity4 v @entity144 ( @entity143 ) nov 22 @entity4 v @entity146 ( @entity143 ) nov 29 @entity4 v @entity33 ( @entity143 ) @entity147 updated feb 6 @entity148 v @entity4 ( @entity149 ) feb 14 @entity4 v @entity150 ( @entity143 ) mar 1 @entity151 v @entity4 ( @entity152 ) mar 14 @entity4 v @entity153 ( @entity143 ) mar 21 @entity4 v @entity154 ( @entity143 ) jun 18 deadline for @entity158 training squad july two - week training camp in @entity160 , @entity161 aug 15 @entity4 v @entity154 ( @entity143 ) aug 22 @entity154 v @entity4 ( @entity162 ) aug 31 squad to be submitted sept 5 @entity4 v @entity151 ( @entity143 ) sept 18 @entity6 opener v @entity163 ( @entity143 ) yet , the criteria are seemingly applied to some players , but not all			1
of the various fly - half candidates , @entity135 is the one without much game time or any really encouraging form this season			0
he , though , is regarded as a man apart			0
provided he is fit , he will surely play , but his lack of momentum is a concern , whatever the official line			0
based on @entity2 ’s explanations , the @entity4 coaches are certainly not indulging in selection by basic hunch or taking wild risks			1
there is an onus on ‘ objective data ’ and a scientific study of all - round credentials			0
the siren call of public or media opinion is blocked out			0
the theme of consistent execution trumping bursts of ‘ flash ’ quality was evident again when the focus turned to the troublesome wing positions			0
@entity194 deserves to be in based on form for @entity48 but he has been reasonably jettisoned because of concerns about his consistence and all - round game			0
the tries keep coming , but at @entity202 other aspects of his game have been exposed			0
@entity203 of @entity38 scored a stunning solo try in @entity152 last sunday and a more emotive management team would perhaps have taken a punt on him			0
but while the @entity207 has the flash factor , he lacks consistency of execution			0
the same principles are being applied in midfield and to @entity214 ’s continued status as first - choice captain and openside flanker			2
his place has been questioned amid acclaim for @entity220 ’s form and speculation about a @entity223 return			0
but he fits in with the current preference for grafters rather than dazzlers , and the fact remains that a back row of @entity229 , @entity55 and @entity230 led a demolition of the @entity32 founded on ferocious and effective work at the ruck			1
that back row , or @entity235 at @entity236 ahead of @entity230 , has complementary assets			0
@entity52 is breathing down the necks of the flankers , as is the returning @entity240 , and this is an area of @entity243 strength , even without @entity223			1
@entity42 wing @entity245 has earned an @entity4 call - up after scoring six tries in seven matches @entity194 ( centre ) has been dropped by @entity4 in favour of @entity76 @entity48 lock @entity251 has also been called up for the first time by @entity4 the same ca n’t be said for midfield			1
@entity254 and @entity255 were the chosen pair in last season ’s @entity257 but @entity2 ’s comments on wednesday pointed to the possibility of @entity261 and @entity262 joining forces next month			1
whatever decision is made , in the enforced absence of @entity266 there needs to be a thread of continuity at centre			0
ideally , a combination will be backed throughout the four - match series			0
all the attention is on those places where the names are in pencil rather than ink			0
by and large , @entity4 are well placed , with good depth and a vast array of options			2
but the suitable time for trying newcomers such as @entity245 and @entity251 is surely nearing an end			1
by the end of november , more certainty is required .			2

@entity15 is the player who encapsulates @entity4 's philosophy
@entity2 opted for @entity84 over the @entity22
@entity22 was the more *popular* choice among outsiders because of his style
*uncapped* trio @entity245 , @entity251 and @entity240 named
@entity2 's side face world champions @entity32 on november 8
@entity297 , @entity146 and @entity33 follow in *consecutive* weeks
