the killer behind the horrific elementary school killing spree would have seen the children he shot dead as ‘ little more than trophies ’ , an expert psychologist has said			1
a lone gunman – believed to be 20 - year - old @entity7 - opened fire at around 9.30am this morning at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
it is understood at least 29 people have been killed – including 22 children - and is the worst spree shooting in @entity16 history			1
professor @entity17 , head of psychology at @entity19 and an expert in spree killings , said the murderer would have seen killing the children as a way of enacting revenge on those he was angry with			1
‘ if this was a revenge spree then he would see the children as useful trophies because each death would injure those he wanted to hurt			1
‘ this was the case in the @entity54 school massacre			0
@entity55 had no connection to the school but saw the killing of the children as a way to punish the community as a whole			1
’ it is understood @entity7 headed to the elementary school where he killed the head teacher before targeting a class taught by his mother			1
expert opinion : professor @entity17 is the head of psychology at @entity19 and specialises in spree killings professor @entity17 said : ‘ it is possible that this spree stemmed from a domestic row and after he killed once , he decided to continue shooting			1
' as he had already killed one person , he may have seen keeping on going as the only option			1
‘ but then the main question is , why shoot the children ? there must have been a motive for that			2
he must have felt he had a grievance with the community that he wanted to punish			0
‘ many spree killers target children as a way to get even with the local community			2
‘ i ’m sure many survivors will report that he was calm and focused			0
these sort of killers are n’t crazed , they know what they are doing and choose who they kill			0
' victim selection is not random , and statements from many spree survivors describe how something about them , their looks , their history with the killer , or even how they pleaded for their life was able to make the killer 's attention shift from them			1
‘ the @entity111 massacre is an example of this , where the killers let some people go but shot others dead			2
' this makes them feel powerful and in control			0
’ professor @entity17 explained that all spree killers have certain things in common – they are unstable , narcissistic , immature and consistently blame others for their failures			1
he continued : ‘ they often believe they should be doing better in life than they are doing and believe it is others ’ fault that they are not			0
‘ they may believe teachers held them back , or blame their parents , but it is never their fault			0
‘ this outlook builds throughout their lives and then it comes to a point that something tips them over the edge			0
’ he said the killing of his mother points to trouble at home but the thing that sent the killer over the edge could also be down to problems at work or university			2
the @entity158 killer @entity157 had been kicked out of his university for failing his exams shortly before his shooting rampage at the midnight screening of the @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity165 , on july 20			2
stunned : people leave the scene outside the @entity8 following a shooting inside the school in @entity9 , @entity10 run : officers evacuate students from @entity8 on high alert : heavily armed @entity175 troopers at the @entity8 as young children are evacuated from the scene murderer : @entity7 , a troubled 20 - year - old loner with a history of autistic behavior , is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a @entity10 elementary school that left 26 people , including 20 children , dead professor @entity17 added that spree killers are often loners who do n’t have partners or children – though there are some exceptions to the rule , such as @entity194 who killed 12 people and injured 11 others before killing himself in @entity197 , @entity198 , in 2010			1
he said : ‘ spree killers are normally aged between their 30s and 40s			0
this killer is in his early twenties , so it is unlikely that he had a partner or a child , but not impossible			2
‘ it is unusual at his young age to carry out a spree killing at an elementary school			0
when they are this young , they tend to carry out their shootings at their university campus			0
‘ a prime example is @entity214 , a @entity215 student , who killed more than 30 people in a spree killing at @entity218 in @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity16 , in 2007			1
' our hearts are broken ' : @entity16 president @entity223 gave an emotional address to the nation after the killings small town : @entity9 in @entity10 has a small population of around 60,000 ' there have also been two spree killings at universities in @entity232 and another two in @entity233 in the last eight years			1
‘ so it is unusual for a man his age to choose an elementary school			0
it appears the main connection must be because of his mother			0
' but he added it was n’t surprising that the killer was not taken alive			2
‘ many spree killers do n’t intend to survive and often will stay alive until police arrive who they will force to shoot them			0
‘ it is then that police , particularly in @entity16 , will start checking the killer ’s home for booby traps and weapons			2
the @entity158 killer left pipe bombs and booby traps in his apartment			2
on march 13 , 1996 , @entity55 walked into @entity256 in @entity257 and shot 16 children and their teacher dead before turning the gun on himself @entity261 : @entity262 and @entity262 killed 13 people in their rampage through @entity111 before taking their own lives in 1999 gunman : @entity267 , 22 , opened gunfire at an @entity270 mall on tuesday , killing two people ‘ they often evacuate the street in case of this but it seems unlikely any would have been set in this case if he lived with his parents			1
‘ it also seems that an argument may have triggered the killings rather than a well - thought - out attack			0
’ but professor @entity17 said his main concern is that the killings will spark a copycat attack			1
he continued : ‘ it is often the case with spree killings that get wide - spread media coverage that another will happen a few weeks afterwards			0
‘ this was the case with the @entity158 killer and @entity54			0
three weeks after @entity54 , @entity294 murdered 35 people and injuring 21 others in the @entity297 , in @entity298 , @entity299 , in 1996			0
he said he had hoped to beat the number of people that @entity55 had killed			1
’ headlines : @entity218 shooter @entity214 sent media packages out before his rampage madness : @entity157 killed 12 people in a @entity165 movie theater during the midnight screening of the new @entity158 movie			1
