scientists say sharing sad emotions helps women bond			1
pictured : film @entity3 it has long been a mystery to men why so many women enjoy watching tear jerker movies with their friends			2
but now scientists have come up with a suggestion – sharing sad emotions helps women bond			1
a research team at @entity14 found that by sharing their emotions women found the happy parts of films more joyful and the sad bits less sad			1
job van der @entity19 , a psychologist at @entity14 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that a negative emotional experience such as watching a ‘ weepy ’ is more positive when it is shared with a friend			2
‘ and , at the same time , a positive emotional experience , such as watching a ‘ romcom ’ , should equally be more pleasant when shared			0
’ the study involved 30 pairs of female friends aged between 20 and 33 who were shown emotionally powerful images and asked to rate them on a scale from ‘ very negative ’ to ‘ very positive ’			1
the scientists put one of each pair in a brain scanner to monitor their reactions , and the volunteers were also asked to view and rate the images while on their own and also while together			1
the researchers found the images were seen more positively when the pairs were together , @entity38 reported			1
the study , published in the journal @entity44 , said : ‘ when people go to the cinema to watch a film , they ... anticipate a positive subjective impact of sharing this emotional experience			2
’ and @entity52 success seems to back the theory			0
the 2008 film @entity55 , which surrounds a couple ’s relationship with their dog , took £ 160m at the global box office , and last year ’s film @entity61 - about two teenage cancer patients who find love - took more than £ 200m			0
