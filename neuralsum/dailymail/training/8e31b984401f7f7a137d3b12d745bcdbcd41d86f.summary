theft : @entity1 had her high - tech car stolen when best - selling author @entity1 spotted that her sporty black @entity4 was missing , it took a few moments for the truth to dawn			1
‘ at first i thought i must have got tipsy the night before and left the car at a pal ’s place , ’ she says			2
‘ but a quick mental reconnoitre later , i realised that no , it was just missing			2
’ for @entity1 , the author of @entity14 and @entity15 , the shock of losing her car was followed by a further surprise			1
first , she learned from the police that this was not an ordinary car theft but ‘ car hacking ’ — a worrying new sort of crime which sees thieves use a hand - held electronic device to exploit a glitch in the ‘ keyless ’ ignition systems used in most top - end vehicles			1
over the past few years , tens of thousands of wealthy owners of keyless @entity34 , @entity31 and @entity32 have become victims			1
‘ no one had told me that keyless cars were vulnerable , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ i ’m also upset about the things i lost which were in the boot — a laptop , a passport and the only outline draft of my next novel			0
and you ca n’t get that back on insurance			0
’ @entity1 ’s car — like all recent @entity47 — did n’t come with a traditional ignition key , but with a plastic fob containing a computer chip and security code			1
when the fob is placed in a slot on the dashboard , the code is detected by the car ’s central computer , allowing the driver to start the engine at the press of a button			1
in some models , you do n’t even have to put the fob into the dashboard slot : simply having it in your pocket or handbag will do the trick			0
keyless cars are supposed to be convenient and more secure			1
in practice , though , they are anything but			0
last month , police in @entity76 ’s @entity75 and @entity77 warned owners that their keyless ignition systems were vulnerable to theft			1
across the country , insurers and car organisations are saying that electronic systems designed to protect our vehicles are just not good enough			1
so how did this happen ? how did sophisticated , supposedly foolproof technology turn out to be so vulnerable ? the irony is that for some years vehicles had actually been getting harder for thieves to steal			1
back in the @entity101 and early @entity102 , anyone could break into a car within seconds			0
some thieves would slide a coat hanger inside a door window , hook it onto the door ’s locking mechanism and yank upwards , opening the door			0
others would use a tennis ball pricked with a hole to blow air into the lock , which forced the lock button inside to pop up			0
it 's a doddle : in the @entity101 and early @entity102 , anyone could break into a car within seconds once inside the car , it was relatively simple to ‘ hot wire ’ the engine by ripping out wires from underneath the dashboard and touching them together to bypass the ignition key			1
security was so lax that car theft became a mini pandemic in the @entity101			0
there was even a new word for it : ‘ twocking ’ , or taking without the owner ’s consent			0
after coming under pressure from consumer groups and insurers , from the mid-nineties , manufacturers started to make their cars more secure			1
improved lock design meant it was no longer possible to unlock a car door with a piece of wire or by jamming a screwdriver into the lock and turning			0
and it became far harder to hot wire an engine by fiddling around with wires under the dashboard			0
cars would automatically lock or trigger alarms if any attempt was made to hot wire them			1
ignition keys also began to come with built - in computer chips , making them harder to copy			1
turning a key in the lock was n’t enough — the car had to detect the chip in the fob before the engine would start			1
but manufacturers did n’t stop there			0
as cars became more complex , an increasing amount of work was handed over to the onboard computer hidden under the vehicle ’s bonnet			1
these computers do n’t just control and monitor the engine , brakes , lights and air conditioning , they also control the locks			0
and that ’s where the problems began			0
‘ as car manufacturers press on with new technology , the thieves are close behind them , ’ says @entity183 of the @entity184			0
‘ that ’s because there is such a ready market for stolen cars			2
a third of all stolen cars are never returned to their owners			2
’ for enterprising criminals , it did n’t take long to find a way of exploiting the technology of keyless cars			1
when you buy a car fitted with this technology , you are issued with a keyless ignition fob programmed by the manufacturer with a unique 40 - digit code			1
place the fob on the dashboard , or just climb into the car with it , and the car ’s onboard computer will detect the code			0
if it matches the one in its memory , the driver is allowed to start the car			2
however , the computer is capable of doing more than just checking the code			0
it can also re-progamme a blank fob with a new code			2
simple no more : cars such as the @entity225 now come with electronic smart cards to replace keys and here is where the trouble begins			2
for just £ 20 , car thieves can buy a blank key fob and a hand - held box that plugs into the ‘ on - board diagnostic port ’ — a socket linked to the computer which is usually found next to the passenger side footwell			1
the hand - held box tells the computer to reprogramme the blank fob with a new code			1
it takes only a few seconds to create a fob that can be used in the car again and again			0
these boxes are available on the internet and were designed so that garages and locksmiths could create replacement fobs for owners whose own sets had been lost or stolen			2
but they are also easily available to thieves			0
thieves still have to get inside the cars , of course			2
some do it the old - fashioned way by smashing a window			2
others lurk close to a car as it parks and use a radio - scrambling device — again , easily bought on the internet — to stop the car locking when a driver presses the remote control button			2
after the driver walks away , unaware that he has left his car unlocked , the thieves can climb in , reprogramme the security system … and drive off			2
@entity273 of the @entity274 , which works on security and safety for the motor insurance industry , says : ‘ the scale of keyless theft is certainly on the increase			2
‘ the devices they use are available on the internet via search engines , auction sites or , in some cases , direct from unscrupulous locksmiths and manufacturers			0
‘ most vehicle brands are potentially at risk because these devices are widespread			0
’ the @entity293 estimate that half of all car thefts involve keyless hacking			1
the @entity297 says @entity4 and @entity298 — two major users of keyless ignitions — are the third and fourth most stolen cars in the @entity302 , behind @entity303 and @entity304 , even though there are fewer of them and they are more likely to be kept safe in garages than cheaper cars			1
the risk was highlighted this year by so - called ‘ ethical hackers ’ — engineers looking for technical weaknesses — who breached security systems by a similar route , to warn manufacturers and the public about the dangers			1
desirable : high - end cars like the @entity31 come with ever - cleverer ignitions - but owners should be careful using a home - made gadget costing just £ 12 , they demonstrated to a conference in @entity325 how it was possible to take over a car ’s onboard controllers and switch on lights , activate the brakes and operate the locks and engine			1
it should n’t be beyond manufacturers to fix this			0
car computers could be tweaked to make it harder to reprogramme a fob without the owner ’s consent			2
however , that would make it more expensive to replace lost keys			0
for now , the onus is on owners to protect their vehicles			0
police and the @entity184 say drivers of keyless cars should invest in an old - fashioned steel crook lock that hooks around the steering wheel or pedals and costs from £ 30			1
these locks were popular in the @entity101 and @entity102 , but have fallen out of favour in recent years			0
‘ you can have all the technology in the world , but when a thief is faced with a piece of locked steel it means the theft will take more time and it reduces the risk of the car being stolen , ’ says @entity183 of the @entity184			0
as for @entity1 , she ’s not willing to forgive and forget just yet			1
‘ i hope that the thieves get endless parking tickets , flat tyres and cracked windscreens , ’ she says			0
‘ do you have any idea how many millions of words i had to write to be able to buy that car ? ’			0

best - selling author @entity1 's sporty black @entity4 became latest victim
police now warn keyless ignition systems can be vulnerable to thefts
sophisticated criminals are able to reprogramme blank key fobs to start cars
