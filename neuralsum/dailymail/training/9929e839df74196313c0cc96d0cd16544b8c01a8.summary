he said : ' we asked her how are you going to celebrate your birthday			0
she said jokingly : " i 'll spend time alone at sea "			1
' maybe @entity57 was trying to be good to her , and did n't want her to spend her birthday alone at sea , so he brought her back			2
' @entity60 got on the plane in her home city of @entity42 on december 28 with her husband , mother , three children and prospective son - in - law			1
they were headed for @entity68 where they would start their cruise , but 40 minutes later disaster struck and the aircraft crashed into the water			2

' @entity60 was the owner of clothes store ' @entity143 ' in @entity42 , and was known for being hard - working and humble despite her own affluence , said another of her nephews , @entity147			1
a devout @entity148 , she regularly made financial contributions to her local temple as well as to orphanages , and she was always quick to help her relatives			0
@entity147 recalled when he was still at high school and living in a dormitory in the east @entity156 of @entity157 , when his aunt and uncle would take turns to drive two hours at weekends to visit him and take him sightseeing around the city			0
' they did not want me to feel lonely , ' he said			0
' it was in my aunt 's character to just help people whenever she could , poor people , her own family , anyone			2
that 's why everyone feels a deep sense of loss			0
' meanwhile , strong currents have forced @entity43 to expand the search area for the crashed plane , as rough seas and bad weather moved debris and made it difficult to reach suspected chunks of the fuselage on the ocean floor			1
two members of the @entity187 look through debris recovered from the crashed @entity6 plane rows of seats , some torn apart and others intact , lie scattered across the floor while a man from the @entity187 inspects them @entity43 police display one of the plane 's safety information modules found among the recovered debris with only a fraction of the bodies recovered since the crash , there are also concerns that it will become harder to find the remaining victims			1
' time is of the essence , ' said the @entity210 's director of operation , @entity211			2
' but it seems like it is hard to beat the weather			0
' the search operation will expand by about 71 square miles ( 185 sq km )			0
@entity216 has identified five large objects which are believed to be pieces of the fuselage on the ocean floor , but strong currents , silt and mud have prevented divers from seeing or reaching the objects			0
no pings have been detected from the plane 's all - important cockpit voice and flight data recorders , because high waves have prevented the deployment of ships which drag ping locators , but the black box may have been located after an @entity43 naval ship discovered what is believed to be the tail section of the doomed jet			1
the tail is where the crucial data recorder is located and holds the key to finding out what happened to the @entity244 when it crashed on december 28			0
the batteries in the pingers on the black boxes are likely to die in about 20 more days .			1
