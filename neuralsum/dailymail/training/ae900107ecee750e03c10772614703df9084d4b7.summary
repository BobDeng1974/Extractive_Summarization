mps on all sides called for a crackdown following revelations that thousands of the broadcaster ’s staff – including dozens of well - known presenters – are employed through personal service companies			0
the arrangement allows them to minimise their tax bills and potentially saves the @entity4 millions in national insurance contributions			1
crackdown : thousands of @entity4 staff , including several high - profile presenters , are employed through personal service companies but @entity5 said it was immoral for a publicly funded organisation to encourage practices designed to minimise tax			2
@entity25 @entity24 , whose freedom of information request revealed that more than 3,000 @entity4 staff were paid in this way , said a @entity30 crackdown on similar arrangements in the public sector should be extended to the corporation			1
mps heard this week that 148 of the @entity4 ’s 467 presenters were paid ‘ off the books ’			1
the list is thought to include @entity38 and @entity39			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ the @entity4 is our national broadcaster and , as such , should be particularly diligent in not pushing the boundaries on this sort of thing			1
we have to assume that these arrangements are legal , but they are certainly not acceptable			0
’ @entity46 was facing questions after figures revealed it had all but abandoned enforcement of laws designed to prevent the misuse of personal service companies			0
high - profile presenter : @entity39 is thought to be one of the 148 @entity4 stars paid ' off the books ' graphic page 10.jpg last year tax inspectors launched 23 investigations into breaches of the rules , down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago			1
reacting to the furore , @entity46 last night said it planned a tenfold increase in enforcement of laws governing ‘ disguised employment ’ in the coming year			0
but @entity67 , @entity68 chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said the figures suggested a ‘ worrying lack of vigilance ’			0
@entity73 , a @entity25 member of the committee , said @entity46 appeared to have been ‘ turning a blind eye ’			0
he also questioned why the @entity4 was refusing to name the stars involved			1
‘ it is quite remarkable that people who are the face of the @entity4 , and who have been working there for years , are not employed by the corporation , ’ he said			2
‘ if it is all legitimate , as we are told it is , then why all the secrecy ? why are people embarrassed about it if it is the right thing to do ? ’ the row follows an explosive hearing at the public accounts committee on monday when the @entity4 ’s finance chief @entity92 was grilled by mps over the corporation ’s employment practices			2
miss @entity96 insisted the arrangements were standard industry practice			0
but mrs @entity67 said a whistleblower had told the committee that the @entity4 was now forcing some freelance staff to set up personal service companies , telling them they were unlikely to be investigated by @entity46 , a suggestion rejected by @entity96			2
yesterday the @entity4 said it was ‘ satisfied ’ its payment arrangements were ‘ appropriate and in line with @entity46 guidelines ’ , adding : ‘ however , in view of the select committee ’s interest in this area , we will undertake a review of the detail of these arrangements and report back to the committee			0
