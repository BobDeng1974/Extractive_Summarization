his legacy is everywhere on this glorious island			2
from roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag , @entity3 transformed @entity8 when he was banished here in 1814			1
famously , he did n't stay for long			2
it was 200 years ago that he escaped , bound for @entity11 and on to a more permanent exile in @entity13			2
but the locals still revere the celebrity prisoner who , for just under a year , was formally recognised as the @entity16			2
inviting : the pretty harbour of @entity18 in @entity8 , an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of @entity20 in this anniversary year , there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour			1
yet , as i sit bobbing on the waters below his villa , i ca n't help thinking that @entity3 must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left			1
for there is something magical , something other about @entity8			1
half the size of the @entity36 , this fish - shaped island has 3,000ft peaks , coral reefs , beaches of every complexion and @entity42 's lowest crime rate			1
though just 12 miles off the coast of @entity20 , it bears little resemblance to the chi - chi tourist trap of @entity46			2
the vast majority of visitors who make the one - hour ferry crossing from @entity51 are ordinary @entity42 ( we do n't meet a @entity52 all week )			1
with a tiny airport , it has been spared major development , and half of its 85 square miles area is national park			2
many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking , biking or , better still , by boat			1
that is why @entity8 is perfect for a sailing holiday , whether you are a sailor or not			1
a comfortable six - bed , 40ft yacht can be a lot cheaper than a hotel or villa			0
you 'd be hard - pushed to find a view to match the one from our deck as we sit back , beer in hand , and watch the sun set behind @entity78			0
@entity80 bobbing : lovely @entity81 is an ideal place to drop anchor , perfect for pizzas and people - watching @entity87 - based @entity86 has yachts all over the @entity89 and has been organising charters around @entity8 and the @entity20 archipelago for years			1
we settle on a @entity93 40 , a popular cruising yacht with a flip - down bathing platform at the back			0
little sailors : @entity98 's children adored life on board the only question is : who will do the sailing ? @entity86 can organise a skipper for £ 90 a day			2
but having been messing around in boats since childhood , i want to take charge			0
you might almost call it a @entity3 complex ( my wife does )			1
so i have to go back to school			0
the basic requirement for renting anything larger than a day boat is the @entity119 's @entity118 certificate , within easy reach of the average dinghy sailor			2
it involves a five - day practical sailing course plus a detailed theory course			2
you can do the latter online , but you must live aboard for the practical part			0
@entity127 runs flotillas and courses all over the world , and i join the fleet on the @entity132			0
it proves invaluable ; after five days mixing with ferries , container ships and hovercraft in one of @entity139 's busiest sealanes , i am more than ready to steer a course for @entity8			1
and you do n't have to worry about tide in the @entity142			0
we pick up the boat at @entity145 , a mainland marina 90 minutes by car from @entity148			2
cleverly designed , it has three double cabins , two separate shower / loo rooms - plus a shower on deck - and a solar panel for extra power			0
setting off in @entity3 's wake , we are swimming off @entity8 's eastern shores three hours later			1
i had feared that our three children would soon start moaning - or being sick			0
but they adore life aboard			0
we keep the sailing to an hour or two each morning before dropping the anchor in a pretty bay , swimming and exploring in the rubber dinghy ( every boat comes with one )			1
i had hoped to spend a night or two on the quayside in a pretty little fishing town such as @entity166 on @entity8 's northern coast , but there 's no chance in mid-august ( unless you know the harbour master )			1
so we anchor off towns like @entity81 and go ashore for pizzas , ice cream and people - watching , then head back - by torchlight - to our haven , far from the nightlife			0
favoured spot : the @entity179 of @entity180 has a three - mile crescent of sand - as well as @entity8 's smartest hotel @entity8 's capital , @entity18 , is well worth a visit			1
walk through the old town to the ramparts at the top			0
@entity3 lived up here and his villa is now a popular museum			1
you do n't need to eat on the waterfront ; the best local food is to be found in the back streets			0
a few miles further along the coast , we find our favourite spot , the @entity179 of @entity180			0
this three - mile crescent of sand , where the trees come right down to the water , is home to @entity8 's smartest hotel , the @entity205			1
when @entity207 's attempt at spaghetti al pesto results in a thumbs - down followed by a mutiny , we jump in the dinghy and , five minutes later , are at the poolside buffet			0
more adventurous sailors would , no doubt , sail right around the island , taking in the wild western shores			2
some would trek up to the mountain town of @entity218 or strike out for the other islands in the @entity20 archipelago - or even reach @entity3 's native island of @entity222			1
@entity223 along at our child - friendly pace , we only do half of @entity8			1
and i never do find the place where @entity3 hatched his escape plan			1
it means that , unlike him , we will have to return			0
@entity232 ( 0844 493 0787 ; ba.com ) flies to @entity148 from £ 82 return			0
@entity86 ( 01732 867 445 ; nautilusyachting.com ) offers seven night yacht charters in the @entity235 from £ 1,149 , excluding flights			0
@entity127 ( 020 3393 0924 ; sunsail.co.uk ) has @entity118 practical courses at @entity238 from £ 459			0
@entity239 ( 0330 223 2533 ; firstsailtraining.co.uk ) does online skipper courses from £ 285 .			0

the small @entity42 island of @entity8 is a perfect setting for a sailing holiday
sailing breaks can mean *access* to coves and bays only reachable by boat
famously , @entity8 played host to @entity3 during his first time in exile
