two undercover police officers who had children with female activists from environmentalist groups they infiltrated have been named for the first time by @entity5 today			1
a high court judge has forced the @entity7 to reveal the identities of @entity9 and @entity10 who joined protest groups to feed information back to the @entity5 in the 80s and 90s			1
women they had sexual relationships with are suing because they claim the men deceived them - but @entity9 and @entity10 - who had fake identities - claim that they were genuinely in love			1
revealed : a high court judge has forced to the @entity7 to give the names of @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , who had relationships with women while undercover last month high court judge mr @entity26 ruled the @entity7 could not use its policy of ' neither confirm nor deny ' ( @entity29 ) in response to damages claims brought by women who said they were tricked into forming relationships with undercover officers			1
the force 's long - standing @entity29 policy was designed to protect the identities and safety of officers working undercover			0
@entity9 - who took the name @entity41 - had sex with three women between 1995 and 2000			2
he later married one of them and they had two children with her before they divorced six years ago			0
@entity10 - who took the name @entity49 and pretended to be a left - wing environmentalist - had affairs with for women between 1984 and 1988 and had a son with one of the women			1
one relationship lasted 18 - months			0
both men were members of the @entity5 's undercover @entity57			0
but after the judge issued the force an ultimatum , the identities of the officers have been disclosed in court papers filed as part of the force 's defence to the civil claims , the @entity7 confirmed today			0
a spokesman for the @entity7 said : ' in compliance with the order of mr @entity26 the @entity7 has confirmed in its defence that @entity9 and @entity10 were undercover police officers			1
' the women are among a number of people who want compensation for emotional trauma allegedly caused by officers infiltrating environmental activist groups			2
their claims for deceit , assault , negligence and misfeasance in public office arise out of long - term and intimate sexual relationships they had with four men who - unknown to them - were members of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , between 1987 and 2007			2
denial : the @entity7 is being sued by the two activisits but @entity9 , pictured , and @entity10 say they were genuinely in love with the women mr @entity26 issued an ultimatum which forced the @entity7 to disclose the names in its defence in order to be able to answer to the claims and had the force not done so within 28 days it would have been taken to admit them			1
at the time , lawyers for the women described the ruling as a ' devastating blow ' for the @entity7			0
solicitor @entity105 of @entity106 and @entity107 said : ' the police have been on notice of this case for three and a half years and until this judgment , they have wilfully refused to engage in any meaningful way with the most serious allegations put to them			0
' their ongoing refusal in the face of an overwhelming body of evidence in the public domain has greatly aggravated the distress caused to my clients , who want answers from the police as well as justice and accountability			0

@entity7 has named @entity9 and @entity10 who had affairs with ' targets '
the men had infiltrated environmental protest groups in the 80s and 90s
women say they were *duped* into relationships - men say they were in love
