this time last year , @entity0 was a happily married father of two little boys aged three and four and lived close to his large , extended family in the village of @entity5 in @entity8 's @entity7 province			1
now , home is a ramshackle refugee camp under the protection of @entity13 peshmerga fighters and he is grieving the loss of his wife and sons			1
his story is far from unique			2
like so many other @entity19 , his family were massacred by @entity21 jihadis as they swept through northern @entity8 in august			1
like them , @entity0 has lost everything			1
it is all he has left of them after they were murdered by @entity31 ' when the @entity33 ( a local slang term for @entity21 ) came to our village , i was not there but called my family and told them to leave			1
it was a big shock for everybody			2
' they managed to escape the village but on the way to mount @entity45 , they met @entity33			2
all of them were killed			2
' his eyes glistening with tears , he adds : ' my older brother , my father , my mother , my wife and even my two kids were killed			2
all i have left of them is just one picture on my mobile phone			2
' the @entity58 are just savages			2
they do not respect religion or humanity			2
they are not humans - even animals have more pity			2
' the first inkling that his formerly peaceful existence was coming to an end arrived when @entity71 fell to the jihadis on june 10			2
as @entity21 cut a swathe through the local population , forcing @entity75 to flee and killing anyone who resisted , the @entity19 watched uneasily			1
gone : @entity80 , from the village of @entity78 near @entity79 , shows a photo of his small nephew who was killed grieving : @entity83 , 16 , is now without his father ( pictured ) and three brothers - all of whom were murdered all that 's left : this man 's brother was killed by the jihadis			1
this photo is all he has to remember him by alone : just eight years old , @entity93 has been forced to fend for herself after her parents were killed by @entity21 their unease was justified for less than two months after the fall of @entity71 , the fanatics were bearing down on their own doorsteps			1
the onslaught began on the 3rd august , when @entity21 fighters surrounded the @entity13 town of @entity79 , which was once home to thousands of @entity19 families			1
many ran but more still were murdered as the jihadis advanced			1
some were offered the chance to convert to @entity108			2
women were kidnapped and raped , as were children			1
others escaped to the top of @entity79 , where , surrounded by jihadi forces , they faced death by starvation and exposure or at the hands of @entity21			1
it was only when the international community , spurred into action by harrowing photos of their plight , launched airstrikes and air drops of relief supplies , that they were saved			2
but for many , @entity0 among them , the horrors of the @entity21 advance remain fresh - and the wounds all too raw			1
bleak : this family was forced to walk for seven days to reach @entity132			1
the baby was named @entity134 tough : the @entity19 living in @entity135 have tents and some food but worry about what winter will bring @entity139 : the camp sits in the middle of a bleak stretch of wilderness , valuable only for what lies beneath temptation : a flaring oil well just behind the camp hints at the financial reason for the @entity21 onslaught @entity93 , an eight - year - old girl now living in a school in the town of @entity135 , is another @entity19 who lost everything when the jihadis attacked			1
her parents were captured by the jihadis as they attempted to escape , while @entity93 herself was forced to endure a trek that lasted seven days			1
' my father and my mother are no longer with me , ' she says , heartbreakingly matter - of - fact			0
' they were caught by @entity33 on the day we left @entity45			0
i escaped on my own			1
' the eight - year - old has no idea where her family might be or even if they are still alive			0
but she remembers the men who tore her world apart all too well			0
' the men from @entity171 had long beards and big weapons , ' she remembers			0
' i walked for seven days in the hills to escape them			0
i do not know if my parents are still alive			0
' others , who were forced to leave their homes so quickly that they could take nothing with them , complain that their children have been left impoverished and hungry			1
survivor : this boy is one of thousands who have fled to @entity132 and @entity183 in the face of the @entity21 advance escape : this lady told @entity188 that she would rather die than be enslaved by @entity21 destitute : @entity190 was forced to leave behind all his goats - and the bodies of 45 family members alone : @entity194 ( left ) has been left to care for her grandchildren while this lady ( right ) saw babies being killed others , such as grandmother @entity194 , who also comes from @entity45 , have been left to bring up orphaned children and mourn others for whom the hot and dusty journey up the side of the mountain proved too much			1
' when we left @entity45 , the kids suffered a lot , ' says @entity194			0
' they cried a lot because we needed to walk day and night			0
' many men from our village died , many women have been captured			1
i saw some kids dying because of the heat - it was nearly 50 degrees			0
' the @entity33 caught my brother and seven members of my family , including one who was 90			0
i do not have any news			0
i do not know whether any of them are still alive			0
' now living in a refugee camp in @entity183 , a village that holds special significance for the @entity19 and the location of their holiest religious site , she worries about the privations that winter might bring			1
' in @entity183 , the weather is cold , ' she frets			1
' @entity229 is coming and we are in a terrible state of health and mind			0
' we do not own anything anymore , we had leave everything			0
we have no clothes , no furniture , no ornaments â€¦ nothing			0
' memories : the surviving members of one family look at photos of their lost loved ones brave : many of the refugees living in the two camps are terribly traumatised children lucky : two of this mother 's children were injured as they fled			1
both have been flown to @entity253 for treatment ' we have left @entity79 through the hills , ' adds another mother , who did not want to be named			0
' we walked for seven days and seven nights			0
we had no food and no water			0
' the @entity33 caught my two sons , my father and two of my sisters			0
i have no news from them and i do not know if they are even alive			0
' @entity33 are crazy people , ' she adds			0
' they even cut the throats of the babies			1
they want us , the @entity19 , to convert to @entity108 , but we refuse			1
' as long as we are not in their hands , we survive			0
we prefer to die instead of being their slaves			2
' although the refugees have been provided with food and tents , it is the psychological scars - particularly among the younger children - that will take longest to fix			0
like @entity93 , @entity287 , 13 , was forced to flee alone and is now living in a refugee camp			1
he has no idea where his parents are and says many of his friends were murdered , scarred : @entity287 , 13 , saw 100 boys from his village murdered by @entity21 , among them best friend @entity294 , nine horrors : like @entity287 , this little girl witnessed the murder of her friends and family hiding : many families have taken refuge in the @entity19 temple at @entity183 revenge : this little boy has vowed revenge on @entity21 and wants to make them suffer as his family has ' the @entity58 came suddenly into my village with many men , ' he recounts			1
' i did n't understand what was happening and i was so scared			0
' i ran but many of my friends were killed			0
i lost my best friend @entity294 - he was nine			2
the @entity33 killed nearly 100 kids from my village			0
' ' when i grow up , i will beat the @entity33 , ' adds another camp resident , a young boy who waves a small pistol in the air as he does so			0
' i will kill them all			0
i will take revenge for all the @entity19 people			1
i want the @entity33 to live through what we suffered because of them			2

thousands were murdered while scores of women were taken as slaves
some survivors such as @entity25 lost their entire families as they escaped
others saw babies murdered and women of all ages being raped
