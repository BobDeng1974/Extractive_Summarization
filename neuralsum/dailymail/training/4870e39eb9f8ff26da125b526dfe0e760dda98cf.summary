there was no specific limit on alcohol levels , the court heard			2
danger : jailing him the judge told @entity17 that his actions could have had ' catastrophic consequences ' mr @entity80 said he found it ' extraordinary ' that rules about pilots drinking ' can encompass any amount of alcohol ' providing 12 hours has elapsed before the flight			1
he said : ' i consider this to be an extraordinarily inadequate way to try to prevent pilots drinking in a way that would not endanger their passengers			2
' adding : ' it is , of course , astonishing , that pilots regularly flying from the @entity8 are not aware of the rules that relate to their own conduct			0

@entity17 's barrister , @entity120 , told the court his client ' had no idea ' he was breaking @entity8 rules at the time of the incident in september			0
he said the married father - of - two had been stressed because his wife in @entity33 had been robbed days earlier and there had been kidnap threats against his children			0
@entity17 came from a distinguished family and his alcohol - related ban had brought shame on the family back home , the court heard			1
alcohol is banned for @entity139 in @entity33 - representing about 96 % of the population			0
there is a ' zero tolerance ' approach to drinking by @entity63 , but in practice the rules are flouted			0
