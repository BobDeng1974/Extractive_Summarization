prostate cancer patients are receiving ‘ second rate ’ care on the @entity4 compared to women with breast cancer , a report warns			1
they are far less likely to be offered the latest drugs , be looked after by a specialist nurse , or given basic pain relief			0
campaigners accuse the health service of discriminating against men with prostate cancer , who tend to be more elderly than women with breast cancer			1
men with prostate cancer are far less likely to be offered the latest drugs , be looked after by a specialist nurse , or given basic pain relief compared to women with breast cancer , according to a new report ( posed by model ) they also say @entity22 , the drugs rationing body , has made fewer prostate drugs available to the health service compared with those for other forms of cancer			1
@entity29 , the @entity30 mp and former health minister who wrote the report with cancer charity @entity32 , said there was a ‘ huge , unacceptable , inexplicable variation ’ in standards			1
he added : ‘ why should men with prostate cancer have to cope with second - rate services , a lack of vital support and limited access to world - class drug treatments and trials ? ’ there are 41,700 new cases of prostate cancer in the @entity47 each year , and one in eight men will contract the disease at some point			1
but the report warns that despite such high prevalence , men with the illness suffer far worse care than other cancer patients			2
@entity57 was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago			1
the married 72 - year - old was told the cancer had spread to his bones – and was therefore untreatable			2
doctors are now giving him drugs to extend his life and help relieve symptoms , but he is not expected to survive past the age of 75			0
however he has never been put in touch with a dedicated nurse – known as a clinical nurse specialist – who could offer expert care and support			0
the father of three , who lives in @entity73 , @entity75 - @entity74 , said : ‘ i would have really appreciated having someone to talk through the basic practicalities , particularly immediately following my diagnosis			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s easy just to focus on the physical – the first thing you discuss is exactly how long you have left – but there is so much beyond that			0
‘ having a dedicated individual to help navigate through the psychological , social and financial side of cancer would have been invaluable			0
’ there is no obvious reason why , but the majority of patients are elderly			0
meanwhile women with breast cancer , for example , tend to be younger and in better health			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ we do require health providers to ask , “ are we doing everything we can to make sure men are getting access to cancer treatments they need as much as women ? ” ‘ it ’s something the @entity103 cancer tsar should be looking at			2
’ despite mortality rates improving substantially thanks to earlier diagnoses , prostate cancer still kills 10,800 men annually			1
but figures show that only a third of men with the disease are offered the chance to take part in potentially life - saving clinical trials – which could also pave the way for new treatments for other patients			0
the report also says that many men with incurable cancers are not offered life - extending treatments such as @entity122 and @entity123			0
this may be because doctors are not aware they are available – or assume they are not worthwhile			0
there are also just 280 specialist nurses in @entity103 for all urological cancers – which include prostate , bladder , kidney and testicular – compared to 425 for breast cancer			1
some 13 per cent of prostate patients felt their care was substandard , against 10 per cent of women with breast cancer			1
twenty - two per cent also felt staff did not do enough to control pain , whereas the figure was 17 per cent for breast cancer patients			2
in addition , far fewer prostate drugs have been approved by @entity22 , meaning men must rely on getting unapproved drugs from the @entity146 – which can only be done through an oncologist			2
@entity148 , the clinical director for cancer at @entity103 , said : ‘ survival rates for prostate cancer are now very high			2
we are not complacent though and know we need to do much more , particularly to reduce variation in services			0
