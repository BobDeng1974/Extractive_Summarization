by @entity0 most of us get stung by an insect occasionally and grumble about it for a couple of minutes before forgetting about it			1
not so for one researcher from @entity8			0
@entity10 , from the @entity9 , has been stung so many times that he decided to create a pain scale to rate the insects ’ stings			1
@entity10 has been stung so many times he decided to create a pain scale to rate insects ' stings			1
he says that the most painful is a bullet ant ( pictured ) which he says ' makes you want to lay down and die ' mr @entity10 ’s scale ranges from zero to four , with a one being a minor reaction , and four being the worst pain you can imagine			1
mr @entity10 explained to @entity25 what a one on the scale would be			2
@entity27 - one ( pain lasts two to four minutes ) @entity29 - two ( pain lasts up to ten minutes ) @entity31 - two ( pain for up to five minutes ) @entity35 @entity34 - two ( pain lasts four to ten minutes ) @entity36 - three ( pain for up to 30 minutes ) @entity38 - three ( pain for one to eight hours ) @entity40 - three ( pain for five to 15 minutes ) @entity42 - four ( pain for up to two hours ) @entity44 - four ( pain for three minutes ) @entity46 - four ( pain for 12 to 24 hours ) he said it would cause a sharp pain but would not be enough to make you drop your drink			2
however , he goes on to explain how he would describe a four – this would be a creature such as a tarantula hawk , which he says feels like being hit by 20,000 volts			2
not only would it make you drop your drink , it would make you throw it across the room , he says			0
he told @entity25 that a bullet ant has the most painful sting he has encountered			0
he said : ' they just make you want to lay down and die			0
you are just screaming in pain and agony			0
' in contrast , he said that the sting of a fire ant is much less painful			0
he said : ' they have this kind of sharp , piercing sting			0
' your immediate reaction is " brush those things off "			0
that 's all its going to do to you			0
' mr @entity10 ranks the bug 's stings from zero to four with four being the worst pain imaginable			1
he rated the sting of the tarantula hawk ( pictured ) a four mr @entity10 believes he has been stung by 150 different bugs			1
he rates the sting of the fire ant ( pictured ) a one and says the pain lasts between two and four minutes according to mr @entity10 ’s scale , a fire ant has one of the least painful stings – a one on his scale – honeybees and bumblebees ’ stings score a two , and the stings of warrior wasps , bullet ants , and tarantula hawks score four			1
he claims to have been stung by about 150 different insects while travelling the world but says it does n't worry him , as none of the insects ’ bites have a lasting impact			2
mr @entity10 says that the pain from a honeybee ( pictured ) sting ranks at two on his scale and lasts for up to ten minutes			1

@entity10 created a pain scale from zero to four to rank insect stings
stings that rate zero cause no pain , those that rate four are the worst
he has been stung by 150 different bugs but says the worst are warrior wasps , tarantula hawks , and bullet ants
