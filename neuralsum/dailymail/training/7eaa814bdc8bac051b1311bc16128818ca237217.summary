by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity4 signing @entity2 offered a display full of promise in his side ’s 7 - 0 evisceration of @entity9 on wednesday and the statistics reveal that the @entity11 is sure to provide an upgrade on the midfielders that toiled with such difficulty under @entity16 last season			1
in the dominant victory in @entity20 ’s first match in charge of the club in @entity23 , @entity2 earned the man - of - the - match award after a performance of poise and creativity in the @entity4 midfield , linking up almost telepathically with his compatriot @entity29			0
albeit against admittedly mediocre opposition , @entity2 enjoyed an encouraging debut , creating three of @entity4 ’s seven goals as he played the full 90 minutes			0
brilliant start : @entity2 appears to be the creative spark @entity4 sorely lacked last season new star ? @entity2 can be an upgrade on @entity4 's midfielders , who struggled to provide assists last season @entity43 - @entity42 - 4 @entity44 - @entity45 - @entity46 - @entity48 - @entity47 van @entity51 - @entity50 - 1 this was as many as any @entity4 midfielder managed in the @entity54 throughout the whole of last season , with the exception of @entity29 , who created four after signing for the club from @entity58 in the january transfer window			1
@entity2 ’s three assists equalled the tallies of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 from the duration of @entity4 ’s traumatic @entity54 season , with the club slumping to 7th position			0
@entity2 , in one match , also dwarfed the single assists registered by under - performers such as @entity72 and @entity73 while players including @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 all failed to create a goal for a team - mate in the 2013/14 campaign			2
@entity4 will hope that the £ 28.4m @entity2 will go some way to correcting the creativity deficit that has seemed to be behind so much of @entity4 ’s toil in recent times			0
hugs : @entity76 ( left ) and @entity2 hug after @entity4 's 7 - 0 victory over @entity9 top of the table : @entity43 provided the most assists for @entity4 last season dream team ? @entity43 ( left ) and @entity4 manager @entity20 ( right ) runner - up : despite only joining @entity4 in january , @entity29 was in second place behind @entity43 in terms of goal assists			1

the @entity11 created three of @entity4 's seven goals against @entity9
@entity43 was @entity4 's top creator last season with 10 assists
@entity29 was second with four - despite only joining in january
they are the only two players who assisted more than three last season
@entity51 , @entity72 and @entity73 only provided one assist each last year
