one of @entity1 ’s predecessors at @entity2 , sir @entity3 , turned the haranguing of referees into something of an art form			1
@entity10 ’s @entity9 opponent at @entity11 , @entity13 ’s @entity12 , has also been known to overstep the mark in his technical area in every sense			1
but as much as he commands an automatic place in the spotlight , @entity10 has been happy to spend his first five months in @entity20 football sat largely in the shadows			1
@entity1 ( third left ) has opted for a measured approach on the bench since taking over at @entity2 @entity10 observes proceedings as @entity2 suffer a surprise loss at the hands of lowly @entity28 the @entity29 has opted not to react furiously while on the sidelines , unlike sir @entity3 the @entity29 has been conspicuous by his absence on the touchline , preferring to stay in his dug - out during games studiously taking notes			1
not for him the antics of @entity3 , who spoke once again this week about the benefits of pointing animatedly to his watch in front of match officials to give @entity2 a little extra ‘ @entity41 ’ when required			1
‘ you think the referee is looking at @entity3 ? ’ he said			1
‘ on television you can see that because every television station is recording the manager , i know			2
but the referee is not looking at the tv			2
maybe after the match , but then he ca n’t change anything any more			2
‘ i do n’t think i can influence the referee , no. when i was in my first year i did everything			2
but i learned to be more quiet			1
i write notes for half - time			1
i can say the things that i am willing to say that can influence the match			0
then the sequence is always the right way because the players remember the moments of the game in sequence			0
it ’s more efficient then			0
’ @entity3 clashed with @entity12 when @entity2 last met @entity13 in a @entity9 fixture at home two years ago , a memorable game that ended 4 - 3 after the @entity2 boss pursued referee @entity69 on to the pitch at half - time			1
sir @entity3 was later criticised by @entity12 and responded with his famous ‘ wee club in the @entity75 ’ putdown			1
the @entity13 boss is no stranger to touchline controversy			0
in the past year alone , @entity12 has been banned for seven games and fined a total of £ 160,000 for butting @entity81 midfielder @entity80 , and warned about his conduct after calling @entity84 manager @entity83 a ‘ f * * * * * * old * * * * ’			2
sir @entity3 's touchline explosions were a familiar sight during his all - conquering reign at @entity2 @entity3 looks aghast in the @entity11 dugout during defeat to @entity91 in 2004 @entity3 and @entity12 fell out on @entity9 2012 following a spat on the sidelines @entity12 was banned for seven games following this headbutt on @entity81 's @entity80 in 2012 he was suspended for two matches and fined £ 20,000 for pushing an assistant referee in a row over a throw - in , having previously been involved in angry altercations with @entity101 and @entity102			1
@entity10 does not see the point in ranting and raving on the touchline			1
‘ i have never had a fight , ’ he said			0
‘ i only use my voice , never my hands or something like that			0
’ so why do other managers scream at their players , officials and rival managers ? ‘ you have to ask them , ’ he replied			0
‘ i do n’t have the idea that you can influence a game by shouting from the sidelines			2
‘ with the fans in the @entity121 shouting so much , the players ca n’t understand you			0
that ’s why i ’m always on the bench			2
you have trained them to read the game by themselves			0
it is much more important that they are more involved with the game , that they make their own decisions			0
it is like a child , you educate			0
‘ sometimes they ca n’t read that but then you have half - time or you have a ( substitution )			1
then you can say to the player who is coming on to the pitch how they have to play in their position			0
you have to transfer that			0
’ @entity2 ’s draw at @entity140 last weekend ended a run of six straight wins in the @entity121 , and @entity10 ’s side are now 10 points adrift of leaders @entity146			1
@entity147 put @entity140 ahead but the game ended 1 - 1 to end @entity2 's winning streak @entity150 has lifted titles throughout @entity152 on all seven occasions his teams have topped the table at @entity155 , but @entity10 has not given up hope of turning @entity2 into champions in his first season in @entity20 football			1
he added : ‘ in the @entity29 and also in @entity160 you have the @entity155 champions but that does n’t count at the end of may or june — then you have to be first			0
‘ it ’s better to be the @entity155 champions , then the possibility you shall be next champion is bigger — but not certain			0
our goal is still to be champions at the end of the season			2
we are looking in a football world where no 1 is the most important thing			0
our goal is to be first			0
’ meanwhile , @entity175 has backed his former club to finish in the top three this season after overcoming a ‘ sticky start ’ under @entity10			1
@entity175 , whose 12 - year stint at @entity11 ended in the summer , is convinced his old side ’s recent revival will continue			1
‘ six weeks ago you ’d be thinking hopefully they ’d get in the @entity183 , ’ @entity175 said			1
‘ looking at them now , they ’ll finish in third place , definite @entity183 , then maybe they ’ll get one of the cups			2
@entity175 warned @entity2 's title rivals to expect a fight come the business end of the season ‘ if they continue on the run they ’re on , who knows ? they could go into second or first , but @entity183 this season would have been something they were asking for			1
‘ @entity10 had a sticky start , but the lads seem to be getting a better understanding of what he wants and you can see that in the results in the last six games			2
@entity206 coming back has been a huge plus for them			0
’ @entity175 also spoke of the change in his relationship with @entity3			1
you listen to him speak now — he created that divide between himself and the players , but now i ’ve spoken to him more than when i played at @entity2			0
he seems like he ’s really enjoying life and i ’m sure he ’s enjoying @entity155 with the family			0

@entity3 was well - known for his *outbursts* on the sidelines
but @entity10 has opted for a more measured approach from the bench
' when i was in my first year i did everything . but i learned to be more quiet . i write notes for half - time , ' he said
meanwhile , @entity175 has backed his former club to finish in the top three this season
