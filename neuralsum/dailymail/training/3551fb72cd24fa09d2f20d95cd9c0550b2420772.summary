by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 9 may 2013 test drilling for shale gas will take place in the @entity4 for the first time this summer			2
@entity6 , the firm behind the only exploratory dig to date near @entity8 , plans to drill a 3,000 feet deep well near the village of @entity10 in @entity11			1
in 2011 , the company was forced to suspend activities in @entity14 after fracking - blasting underground rock to release trapped pockets of shale gas - was suspected of causing two small earthquakes			2
the @entity6 shale fracking facility in @entity19 , @entity14 , last year in the face of strong local opposition , it has given an ' unequivocal assurance ' it will not use fracking at the exploratory well			1
but it could be extended horizontally underground by 2,500ft and is intended to discover how much recoverable gas is below the @entity27 countryside			2
' although this summer 's work will be unobtrusive , we 're fully aware that local people will have many questions about our plans and we 'll do our best to answer all of them , ' said @entity33 , @entity6 's chief executive			1
' during the coming months , we will discuss our plans with residents and they will be able to visit the site to see for themselves what our work involves			1
' @entity6 , which won planning permission for the work in 2010 , promised to hold extensive technical , environmental and public consultations if oil or gas are found			1
it would have to apply for a new licence - and win over suspicious locals - if it intends to frack the site in the future			0
the technique is a way to retrieve gas trapped in underground rock by injecting high - pressure water and chemicals , but so far has only been widely successful in the @entity55 in the next few weeks , an official report by the @entity57 is set to be released and expected to announce @entity59 's shale gas deposits are far larger than previously predicted			0
controversial : demonstrators hold placards in protest against hydraulic fracturing for shale gas outside the @entity65 in @entity66 industry experts estimate we could be sitting on enough gas reserves to supply the nation for more than a century , fuelling hopes the @entity73 energy landscape can be transformed like the @entity55 , where drilling has driven down prices			0
@entity76 wants to see @entity59 at the heart of the ' shale gas revolution ' , and the chancellor has pledged to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry in a bid to promote investment			0
fracking was temporarily halted at @entity59 's only test drill site in 2011 , after two small tremors woke some residents in @entity8			1
but operations were allowed to resume in december after energy secretary @entity90 announced greater restrictions aimed at limiting the likelihood of tremors			0
critics say any shale gas energy boom will scar the countryside , pollute water supplies and could line the pockets of foreign firms rather than boosting the @entity59 economy .			0

@entity6 plans to drill well near village of @entity10 in @entity11
it is firm behind the only exploratory dig to date near @entity8
