@entity0 and @entity1 will start the @entity3 @entity2 on the front row of the grid , the @entity6 on pole , the @entity8 alongside him			1
within a few gear - flicking seconds , the road will narrow at the @entity11 and the two of them will try to thread their silver @entity14 over the corner ’s kerbs in the shortest and fastest way			1
both hope to reach the next corner , the flat - out @entity20			0
but there are no guarantees that they will reach there and none they will leave			0
duopoly : @entity0 managed to get the better of title rival @entity1 during qualifying grid : @entity0 will be on pole at @entity31 while @entity14 team - mate @entity1 starts in second place 1			1
@entity0 ( @entity14 ) 2			1
@entity1 ( @entity14 ) 3			1
@entity33 ( @entity34 ) 4			0
@entity35 ( @entity34 ) 5			0
@entity36 ( @entity37 ) 6			0
@entity38 ( @entity37 ) 7			0

@entity44 ( @entity45 ) in front of up to 100,000 fans in this crumpled cathedral of @entity3 motor racing at the centre of the tree - strewn @entity53 , the latest unmissable instalment of the 2014 world championship will unfold			1
most of those here with their banners are disciples of @entity40 , the team that @entity59 built into an icon of a nation , but , with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace , it is the tussle between a cerebral @entity8 and an instinctive @entity6 that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon			1
the backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at @entity68 , where @entity0 and @entity1 collided on the second lap. @entity0 ultimately retired from the race			1
@entity1 , the aggressor , survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the championship to 29 points			1
race : mercedes say that their drivers can to battle it out between them free from team orders the row afterwards was even more feisty			2
it ended up with @entity1 being fined by @entity14 and apologising to his team , his rival and seemingly the whole world			1
both were warned to keep it clean , though management will permit them to race free of team orders			0
so after @entity0 yesterday claimed his first pole since the @entity93 @entity2 on may 10 , the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments today along the fastest lap in @entity96			1
would the keep - it - clean instruction be in their minds ? ‘ it wo n’t be ringing in ‘ my ’ ears , ’ said @entity0			1
sitting next to him , @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a question i am not able to answer			2
the message is that we keep on racing			0
’ tense : the relationship between the two drivers has broken down since the @entity107 @entity0 was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference			1
‘ it is a great feeling to be up here , ’ he said , with the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted @entity1 ’s run of six poles in seven races			2
@entity14 ’ outright pace suggests they should be too strong to be challenged , yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected			2
‘ every race is important , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but time is running out			0
’ all the top six — @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity33 in third , his @entity34 team - mate @entity35 and the @entity37 pair of @entity36 and @entity38 — are powered by @entity14 engines			1
@entity14 : the @entity8 team are unlikely to be troubled in @entity3 , unless they suffer more mechanical problems to the disgruntlement of the @entity3 fans , @entity39 starts in seventh place while the second @entity40 of @entity131 was only 12th fastest			1
@entity40 ’s recent dismal run of form led the @entity31 rumour - mill to suggest that @entity135 , the 67 - year - old team president , might stand down after more than 40 years with the company			2
but with a sweep of his hair , he dismissed tales of his demise			0
‘ i told the board in march that i was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people , the women and men of the @entity40 , ’ he said			0
living up to his theatrical billing , @entity146 enveloped @entity39 in a long , lingering , listing hug			0
another hugger was @entity0 , embracing his dad on the way to the car			2
there is at least some love here among the enmity .			0

@entity3 @entity2 at @entity31 the latest setting for @entity14 feud
@entity0 is on pole , @entity1 starts in second
@entity8 driver is 29 points *ahead* in drivers standings
