by @entity0 plans to harvest private data from patients ’ @entity6 files are causing a ‘ crisis of public confidence ’ , the @entity1 said yesterday			1
the professional body said it was ‘ very worried ’ that the public had not been properly informed about the scheme , which is due to begin this spring			1
information about past illnesses , medication , weight and blood pressure will be taken from medical files and put into a database unless patients opt out			1
the @entity1 of @entity20 has warned the @entity6 that they face a backlash for lack of information about their data sharing plans @entity6 officials say the data will be used for important research and to show up poor care – and that all the data will be made anonymous			1
but experts say patients will be identifiable from their data – which will be passed on to private companies including insurance firms			1
a growing number of gps oppose the care.data scheme , and say their patients will refuse to give them information for fear it will be harvested			2
yesterday the @entity1 – which represents 46,000 @entity20 – accused @entity6 officials of failing to inform patients about the scheme			1
the organisation said patients had not been told why their data was needed , nor how they could opt out			2
professor @entity48 , the @entity1 ’s honorary secretary , said : ‘ we are very concerned that , with just seven weeks to go before the roll out , the public have not been properly informed about the benefits of and the safeguards surrounding the care.data program			1
the result of the failure to make the case for the scheme is the crisis of public confidence that we are now seeing			1
‘ we urgently need a renewed national push by the authorities to ensure that patients are fully informed about the benefits of the scheme , what their rights are , and what their rights to opt out are			0
’ the warning comes just days after the @entity1 ’s former chairman backed the scheme by claiming it was ‘ perfectly safe ’			2
patient data about their previous medications , medical histories , procedures and other personal information risks being shared to private companies like insurance companies , something that might cause the @entity6 to face a trust crisis dr @entity81 , who stepped down in october , said patients had ‘ nothing to fear ’ by sharing their data and promised it would be held in a ‘ safe haven ’			1
writing in a national newspaper , she added : ‘ we , patients and citizens alike , will all be the beneficiaries , as scientists , analysts and health service planners will have access to an amazing source of information			2
’ but at least four gps are so opposed to the scheme they have opted out all the thousands of patients on their lists – apart from a few who are willing for their data to be shared			1
these four include dr @entity104 , who practises in @entity105 and has been warned by @entity6 officials that his actions may cost him his job			1
the scheme is set to begin next month			0
at first , data will only be taken from a few surgeries to check the system works properly			0
it will then be rolled out nationally in april			0
@entity113 claim the data will reveal where patients are receiving a lower standard of care			2
but officials admit data will also be shared with private firms – including insurers – who could use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain illnesses			1
last week data expert professor sir @entity126 warned that firms could track down individuals within a few hours			2
the information is meant to be stored anonymously – with only dates of birth and postcodes on file – but sir @entity126 said it would be easy to find patients from those details			0
last month the @entity6 began posting leaflets about the scheme but in many instances they have been thrown out as junk mail			0
and the leaflets do not fully explain how to opt out , with some surgeries asking for it in writing and others wanting it done by phone			0
@entity149 , of the campaign group @entity151 , said : ‘ this publicity campaign has been a complete fiasco			0
there is absolutely no justification now for the upload of information from patients ’ records			0
‘ @entity113 has failed to communicate what it is doing			0
virtually none of the people i meet – normal folk – are aware that anything is going on			0
‘ if they are going to have an opt - out mechanism , they must write to each patient and tell them exactly what is happening with their data , why and to whom it is going to go			0

@entity6 warned that data sharing could cause ' crisis of public confidence '
professional body , @entity1 ' very worried '
information about patients could be shared with private companies
