ever struggle to stay motivated when planning a trip to the gym ? well , it way not be your fault - it may all be down to the way your brain 's wired			2
scientists have pinpointed the region of the brain that is responsible for exercise motivation			1
while the finding could one day lead to a way of encouraging people to be fit and healthy , researchers say it could also be used to create better treatments for depression			2

experts from @entity25 discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice @entity29 and @entity30 , of @entity32 ’s @entity31 , discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice			1
the structure of the habenula is similar in humans and rodents and these basic functions in mood regulation and motivation are likely to be the same across species , they explained			1
the knowledge that such a specific area of the brain may be responsible for motivation to exercise could help researchers develop more targeted , effective treatments for depression			1
exercise is known to be the most effective non-pharmaceutical therapy for melancholy			0
the structure of the habenula ( illustrated ) is similar in humans and rodents and these basic functions in mood regulation and motivation are likely to be the same across species , they explained while the finding could one day lead to a way of encouraging people to be fit and healthy , researchers think it could be used to create better treatments for depression ( illustrated in this stock image ) the dorsal media habenula is a tiny area of the brain that is responsible for exercise motivation			1
it has been found to control the desire to exercise in mice			2
the structure of the habenula is similar in humans and rodents			2
the knowledge that such a specific area of the brain may be responsible for motivation to exercise could help researchers develop more targeted , effective treatments for depression			1
past studies have attributed many different functions to the habenula			0
a 2010 study revealed that the habenula plays a key role in helping animals survive in a world full of hidden rewards and dangers , by helping them make the best choices			0
it inhibits dopamine - releasing neurons when an animal fails to obtain a reward and is involved in behavioural responses to pain , stress , anxiety , sleep and reward			0
dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain 's reward and pleasure centres			0
the habenula ’s dysfunction is associated with depression , schizophrenia and psychosis			0
‘ changes in physical activity and the inability to enjoy rewarding or pleasurable experiences are two hallmarks of major depression , ’ dr @entity29 said			0
‘ but the brain pathways responsible for exercise motivation have not been well understood			0
now , we can seek ways to manipulate activity within this specific area of the brain without impacting the rest of the brain ’s activity			0
’ the research , published in the @entity133 , used mice that were genetically engineered to block signals from the dorsal medial habenula			1
dr @entity29 's team collaborated with experts at the @entity139 to show that the genetically engineered mice were lethargic and ran far less than typical mice , which love to run in their exercise wheels			2
the genetically engineered mice also lost their preference for drinking sugary water			0
‘ without a functioning dorsal medial habenula , the mice became couch potatoes , ’ dr @entity29 said			1
‘ they were physically capable of running but appeared unmotivated to do it			0
’ in another group of mice , the team activated the dorsal medial habenula using laser technology called optogenetics			1
the mice could choose to activate this area of the brain by turning one of two wheels with their paws			0
the scientists found that the mice ‘ strongly preferred ’ turning the wheel that stimulated the dorsal medial habenula , which they say demonstrate that this area is linked to rewarding behaviour .			1

scientists from @entity32 discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice
structure of the rodent 's habenula brain area is similar to humans
functions in mood , regulation and motivation are likely to be the same
finding could help experts develop more effective treatments for depression
