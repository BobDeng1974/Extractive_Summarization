click here for all the big match stats from our brilliant @entity3 service it is as if football ’s fates are conspiring to torment @entity8 in his remaining years			1
they show him the prize , let him glimpse the glory and then snatch it away			0
that title slip , a wretched @entity14 as @entity16 captain , and now this , possibly his last appearance in the @entity18 , able to do so much , but not enough			1
no single player worked harder to drag @entity21 into the last 16 than @entity8			1
it was not to be			0
maybe it never will be again			0
he needs greatness around him these days , certainly to thrive in the @entity18			1
he needs a match winner in the manner of @entity28 , a rock like @entity30 , a coach with the cussedness of @entity32 to teach ordinary players to defend for their lives			1

ratings by @entity85 at @entity86 they are gone , and so are @entity21 now			1
gone from this competition and probably from next season ’s too unless they can spectacularly reverse their trajectory in the @entity93			0
if @entity8 stays a @entity21 player it may be the 2016 - 17 season before he can think of playing in the @entity18 again			1
he can not soldier on alone			0
that this ended in a grandstand finish is to @entity8 ’s immense credit			1
down to 10 men and ordinary in the extreme for much of the game , @entity21 ultimately took @entity37 to the wire because their captain refused to surrender			1
having won a free - kick on the edge of the area with nine minutes remaining , @entity8 stood over the ball			1
could he ? would he ? he did			0
he curled it inside @entity37 goalkeeper @entity112 at the near post and gave his team the puncher ’s chance they scarcely deserved			1
and right there is @entity8 ’s agony			1
@entity48 had two chances late on – one a shot in injury time that forced a stunning full length save from @entity112 , but it was to no avail			2
@entity8 was spared the opprobrium from the @entity86 public that greeted this exit , but that will be scant consolation either			1
@entity131 is slipping away , and he knows it			0
they shout for him this season , but what else is there to shout about ? there were 72 minutes gone when @entity8 had his first chance to change the game			1
he was through , one on one , and set to equalise			0
might this be it ? the night of folklore and legend that @entity58 had forecast ? sadly , @entity21 ’s story has lost that magical element this season			1
out came @entity112 throwing himself at @entity8 ’s feet			1
his outstretched hand connected with the ball first , then @entity8 ’s leg			1
the captain appealed furiously , so did the crowd			2
referee @entity81 shook his head			0
the writers of myths and epic tales had knocked off for the night			2
@entity8 was doing his best to imbue the occasions with glory , but it was not to be			1
and the task was straightforward enough			0
beat @entity37 , reach the last 16			2
yet only in those frenzied final exchanges did @entity21 come close			2
a goal down after 25 minutes , they removed their main striker @entity50 at half - time so ordinary was his first - half display , but fared little better for this			1
@entity8 curls home a sublime free - kick to give @entity21 a lifeline with around 10 minutes left on the clock @entity48 ( left ) rushes to congratulate his captain as @entity21 began to believe they could turn the match around @entity8 celebrates after his free - kick left @entity21 needing one more goal to qualify with 10 minutes left @entity8 earlier went tumbling in the box in the second half but @entity37 goalkeeper @entity112 had got his hand on the ball first @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity37 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 + 2 more teams from wednesday night ’s matches the draw for the knockout phase takes place in @entity195 on monday , december 15 @entity51 came on in his place , offering a spark of life , but then calamity struck			1
just 16 minutes after arriving he was dismissed , a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent			0
@entity51 , who had looked lively out wide with @entity49 moved to @entity50 ’s role , was speeding away from @entity61 when , for reasons best known to himself , he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back			2
if he touched the @entity37 man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire			1
@entity81 bought it , and @entity51 was shown a straight red card			2
he had local sympathy but , let ’s face it , if @entity217 had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness			0
from there , @entity21 ’s task appeared impossible			2
that they ended up even within a goalmouth scramble of victory is due to @entity8 ’s refusal to quit			2
but one day he must quit			0
one day he will quit			0
and what will they do then ? @entity51 makes the slightest of contact with @entity61 's face in the incident that led to his sending off @entity229 defender @entity41 protests as substitute @entity51 is shown a straight red card for catching @entity61 players from both sides surround the referee as @entity61 lies on the floor and @entity51 leaves the field the result means @entity21 finish third in @entity237 behind @entity238 and @entity37 @entity239 and bottom of it , @entity21 looked overwhelmed , almost afraid of the challenge here			1
the mood was set in the first minute of the match			2
a loose ball fell to the experienced @entity42 at the heart of @entity21 ’s defence , and he cleared in panic , like a novice			2
up it went into the night air , barely an inch further forward , requiring much hurried regrouping beneath			0
variations on this theme were prevalent throughout the first - half			1
simple passes went astray or were miscontrolled , touches were poor and good positions were wasted			0
@entity86 , so often @entity21 ’s greatest friend on nights like this , sensed the desperation			2
the noise was often muted , a worried murmur or frustrated howl as counterpoint to the buoyant visitors from @entity268			0
@entity58 had spoken of his team becoming part of @entity21 lore , but the history of this club is great and proud and this group seemed intimidated by the challenge of maintaining that standard			2
players that had looked like world beaters last season shied away from the responsibility			0
@entity49 cuts a frustrated figure in the @entity284 rain as @entity21 struggle to get a foothold in the match @entity58 looks dejected as @entity21 failed to create any meaningful chances in the first half @entity49 ’s shots had no potency and when @entity8 played a good ball to @entity40 for a counter-attack on the right , he sloppily let it run out of play , provoking a furious reaction from the former @entity16 captain			1
@entity50 did not get a sniff			0
it was a sobering evening , not only for the player but also for the committee that guides @entity58 ’ hand in the transfer market			0
@entity21 could have bought close to 20 @entity305 for what they got for @entity28 , but it is class that is required to win occasions like this ; not numbers			1
basle are not a great side , but they are competent and technically tight and their goal after 25 minutes was all of that			0
@entity64 played the ball into tormentor in chief @entity66 , who held it up , returned it , and @entity64 ’s shot did the rest			2
it was in the net without so much as a dive from @entity39			0
the defending was slack but why so startled ? @entity268 international midfielder @entity64 fires in a shot from the edge of the box that gave @entity37 the lead early in the first half @entity49 ( right ) ca n't believe his eyes as @entity333 wheels away to celebrate his sweetly struck strike a glum @entity49 watches on as @entity64 's gleeful team - mates rush to celebrate the goal which put @entity37 in the driving seat @entity37 's players celebrate wildly as they begin to sense an upset at the home of the five - time @entity18 winners @entity64 's goal was a well worked team move involving six passes			1
click here for more from our brilliant @entity3 service @entity8 and @entity46 trudge back to the halfway line after the @entity349 fell behind through @entity64 in the first half @entity37 could have gone further ahead after 33 minutes when poor marking left striker @entity70 alone to receive a cross from @entity353			1
he tried to take it on the volley , but missed			0
had that gone in , it would have surely been game over – so too , the chance that fell to @entity59 six minutes later , blocked on its way to goal			0
instead , @entity8 was allowed one more swing at playing the hero			2
it is an act that never outstays its welcome but , in this competition at least , it may have outlived its effectiveness			0
@entity45 ( left ) and @entity48 sink to the turf as they realise @entity21 's @entity18 campaign is over @entity37 players celebrate their qualification to the @entity18 knockout phases as @entity81 blows the final whistle former @entity16 team - mates @entity8 and @entity49 look lost for words after the final whistle			1

@entity21 out of the @entity18 and in to the @entity376 after finishing third in @entity237
a win would have sent the @entity349 through and @entity37 knew a draw would be enough for them
@entity64 gave @entity37 a first - half lead before substitute @entity51 was sent off for @entity21
@entity21 captain @entity8 scored a sublime free - kick late on but they could not find the winner
@entity37 's @entity36 's man of the match . @entity8 @entity21 's best player on the night
