by @entity0 moors murderer @entity1 did show remorse while in jail – but only for the death of her pet dog , according to a letter published for the first time today			1
@entity1 , who along with her lover @entity10 was jailed for life for the murders of five children in the 1960s , wrote that the thought of her beloved dog ‘ puppet ’ reduced her to tears			1
in a letter to @entity21 ’s mother @entity20 written on thursday 2 december 1965 she wrote : ' i have n’t yet received the ‘ report ’ on the dog			1
they were quick enough to kill him , but are taking their time about giving me the report			0
' it has been revealed that @entity1 was reduced to tears in jail when she learned that her beloved dog puppet had died she added : ' however i ca n’t dwell on this subject for very long , it hurts too much to even think about @entity16 without crying			1
' the 23 - year - old who was just four months away from being found guilty of one of the most infamous and sadistic crimes in @entity38 legal history does not make any reference to her offences in the letter which was written from her cell at @entity43			1
instead she recalls at length the relationship she and @entity21 , then 27 , shared with their family pets including mrs @entity49 ’s own dog @entity50			1
she wrote : “ i know you understand how @entity52 and i feel about this as you thought so much of @entity50 , that you know how a dog who is part of the family can mean so much			2
@entity52 was terribly upset about @entity50 when he died but he would n’t show it			2
” in the handwritten letter which has been obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws @entity1 recalls how @entity16 and the dog ’s mother @entity61 could barely contain their excitement when she and @entity21 returned home from work			1
she wrote : ' at night when we returned from work , the dogs would hear the car doors slam and @entity61 , the devil , would actually jump onto the table under the window , wagging her tail and barking , and @entity16 would run in the hall , stand on the 3rd ( sic ) stair and stick his nose through the letter box			2
as soon as we ’d opened the door , he ’d fly to @entity52 , nearly knocking him over and then run for his stick ( which @entity52 made specially for him ) and drop it at @entity52 ’s feet and would keep picking it up and dropping it until @entity52 picked it up			0
' @entity10 , left , and @entity1 , right , who would take various dogs on trips to the countryside in the months leading up to their arrest @entity1 who had been in a relationship with @entity21 for almost six years also recalls how they would take the various dogs out on trips to the countryside in the months leading up to their arrest			1
she wrote : ' puppet could nearly talk , he was such an intelligent dog			2
it got so that we had to spell the word ( walk ) ‘ out ’ if we wanted to say it , for the very mention of the word , he would bark madly and run for his stick			0
' every time i had a photo taken with @entity50 , i had to bribe her ( @entity61 ) with @entity110 ’s			0
she would n’t leave @entity52 while he just took a photo			0
she had me scratching her tummy for hours while she lay on @entity52 ’s knee in the back seat			0
she was a lovely little dog			2
i used to laugh at her heavy feet they always reminded me of a chicken			0
' it is impossible to reconcile the couple ’s obvious love for the pets with the depravity of their crimes which were committed on and around @entity125 between 1963 and 1965			0
the pair who were initially charged with the murder of @entity10 , @entity128 and @entity129 and the court heard a tape recording of the ten year old @entity133 pleading for her life			1
@entity21 was found guilty of all three murders and was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and @entity1 who was found guilty of the murder of @entity10 and @entity133 was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences			1
she was sentenced to another seven years for harbouring @entity21 in the knowledge that he had killed @entity129			1
police search @entity125 for the bodies of children who were killed by @entity1 and @entity21 the pair escaped execution because the death sentenced had been abolished while they were on remand			2
@entity1 ’s frustration about the police ’s failure to hand over the file on her dog ’s demise is in stark contrast to how she made the families of other victims wait decades before revealing their fate			0
only in 1985 did she and @entity21 admit their role in the death of two other children @entity164 and @entity165			2
in the letter @entity1 bemoans the fact that her former work colleagues are now enjoying the five day week she campaigned for			0
she said she could ‘ kick herself ’ for missing out on the concession and finishes off her letter by adding : ' its just one rotten thing after another			0
still , not to worry we ’re not dead yet ... love @entity1			0
' @entity1 died in 2002 at the age of 60 and @entity21 , now 76 , was declared clinically insane in 1985			1
he is now a patient at high security @entity177 .			0
