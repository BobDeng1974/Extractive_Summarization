billed as @entity2 's first player - powered football pitch , a field in a @entity5 slum has been opened that harnesses the kinetic energy of players ' movements to provide night - time illumination			1
football legend @entity11 was on hand for the event in the @entity15 slum , which saw a local youth team put the system to the test			1
under the project , sponsored by @entity24 , about 200 energy - capturing tiles developed by @entity22 startup @entity20 were installed the width and breadth of the field and covered by a layer of @entity29			1
about 200 energy - capturing tiles harness player movements to power lights working in conjunction with solar panels also installed around the field , the player - powered tiles feed electricity to a system of floodlights overhead			1
a safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring during sports			0
the @entity49 device monitors the movement of players , keeping track of any dangerous impacts			0
any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player 's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees , as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines			2
the gadget was created by ceo @entity64 from @entity65 , @entity66 after he suffered from concussion himself			0
it is hoped the @entity49 will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury			2
the company are aiming to start shipping the product in april 2015 , with a @entity77 campaign currently taking place to raise £ 36,000 ( $ 60,000 )			0
while the head of @entity20 , engineer @entity80 , did not reveal the exact science behind the tiles , his father and the company 's chairman , @entity84 , said they use a system of cogs			0
when stepped on , the cogs spin like tops and act like generators , he said			0
each tile now costs about £ 310 ( $ 500 ) , but the price is falling as the 35 - employee company refines its manufacturing process , mr @entity80 said			0
@entity20 has installed similar tiles in train stations in @entity99 , shopping centres in @entity101 and @entity102 of @entity104 's @entity103 , @entity105 said , but the football field is a first			1
' we 've effectively turned this community into a real - life science experiment , ' he said			0
' i believe this technology can be one of the future ways we illuminate our cities			2
' similar tiles have been employed in airports , shopping centres and more but this is the first time they have been used on a football field the new pitch was launched by @entity2 football legend @entity11			1
the technology could also apparently be used to power future cities @entity11 got emotional over the project , tearing up as he said he hoped the new field would help spark local kids ' interest not only in football but in science			1
' my father named me @entity131 after @entity132 , ' said the longtime star striker , whose birth name is @entity135 do @entity136			0
he said he hopes the next generation of @entity2 will help bring the country as much success in science as it has had in football			2
' i 'm sure that soon the number one scientists in the world are going to be @entity2 , ' @entity11 said .			1

a field in @entity5 has been converted into a high - tech football pitch
about 200 energy - capturing tiles harness player movements to power lights
the new pitch was launched by @entity2 football legend @entity11
the technology could also apparently be used to power future cities
similar tiles have been employed in airports , shopping centres and more but this is the first time they have been used on a football field
