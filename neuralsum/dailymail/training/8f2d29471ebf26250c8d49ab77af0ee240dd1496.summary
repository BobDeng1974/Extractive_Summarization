@entity2 , who married the @entity17 actress a few weeks ago , went to @entity4 ’s @entity3 to prevent a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ‘ silly schoolboy antics ’			1
the images of the 34 - year - old , who is a nephew of sir @entity25 , were discovered on a @entity27 page			1
@entity2 , who changed his surname from @entity30 , was granted a temporary injunction last thursday , shortly after @entity33 newspaper contacted @entity11 ’s publicist about the pictures			1
the newspaper yesterday contested the injunction			0
this afternoon mr justice @entity37 ruled in favour of mr @entity2 preventing the newspaper from publishing the photos			1
he will outline his reasons for the decision at a later date			0
mr @entity2 and miss @entity11 said later in a joint written statement : ' we have stopped @entity33 from publishing semi-naked photos of @entity46 taken by a friend at a private 21st birthday party a few years ago			1
' the photos are innocent but embarrassing and there is no reason to splash them across a newspaper			0
' we recognise that in the internet age privacy is harder and harder to maintain			0
but we will continue to do what we can , particularly to protect @entity11 's children from the results of media intrusion			1
@entity11 's husband @entity2 , pictured together , went to @entity4 's @entity3 to prevent photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published ' we refuse to accept that her career means our family ca n't live a relatively normal life			1
' the @entity33 ’s publisher , @entity65 subsidiary @entity65 , argued the pictures , which were taken from a publicly accessible @entity27 profile belonging to @entity2 ’s friend , @entity69 , were already publicly available			1
the group also said that @entity2 is a public figure and has a lower reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen			2
@entity2 ’s lawyer , @entity75 , told the court yesterday that the pictures of a ‘ partly naked ’ @entity78 in a fancy dress costume were taken at a private party , which had the theme ‘ outrageous ’ and would cause distress to him if they were printed			2
mr @entity75 told the court : ‘ this application is not to hide some guilty secret , as i said in the interim hearing			2
it is not to keep something secret			0
the claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his privacy			0
‘ it was a private party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to see these photographs as anything other than private family photos			0
’ he told the court and judge mr @entity37 that the photos showed @entity78 indulging in ‘ silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party			1
it is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures			0
’ privacy : mr @entity2 's lawyer @entity75 said his wife 's children would be bullied if the pictures were published mr @entity75 added that @entity2 was ‘ horrified ’ at the prospect of the pictures being published			1
he explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ‘ considerable embarrassment and humiliation ’ for @entity11 and her children , who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public			1
he also said that he was not a role model and had been a ‘ relative nobody ’ prior to his marriage to @entity11 in december			2
@entity2 , who was previously head of marketing for @entity128 ’s @entity127 space - exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer , was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit , married the @entity132 in a low - key ceremony in @entity134 in december			2
the hearing follows the publication of a report in march last year by the @entity138 on @entity108 and injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis			0
@entity2 is the latest in a long line of figures and celebrities to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of their private lives			2
in 2011 , sir @entity154 , the disgraced banker who took the @entity155 to the brink of collapse , obtained a @entity3 injunction			2
the order , which bans mention of matters sir @entity154 wishes to keep secret , was disclosed in the @entity165 mp @entity164 using parliamentary privilege			0
footballer @entity167 also took out an injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model @entity172 , despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet			0
