by @entity0 published : 14:36 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 16:17 est , 20 february 2013 @entity1 has been the toast of @entity3 after gracing the catwalk for designers @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 - to name but a few - and landing her first @entity10 cover this month			1
with a number of lucrative modelling contracts under belt and the accolade of @entity16 from the @entity17 , the style pack have been hailing her as the new @entity18 since she signed for the same agency , storm , in 2009			1
but the 20 - year - old famed for her bushy eyebrows recently told @entity10 that her rise to become model of the moment has come as something as a shock to her - and she ' ca n't believe ' she 's so in demand in the world of fashion			1
runway star : @entity1 at @entity3 for @entity6 , left , and @entity7 , right in demand : the model with designer @entity35 at the @entity37 show ' my mum was into fashion and so were my two sisters			1
i was never as into it as much but there would always be magazines around the house and i would stare at them and be like ' what is this ? ' i never understood it , fashion was very alien thing to me , ' she said			0
already photogenic : cara as a baby with a love of drumming and fan of dressing down in onesies and beanies , she could come across as an unlikely super star to those uninitiated to the @entity1 family			0
for as @entity62 wrote in @entity63 last year : ' apart from her beauty , there is another thing which @entity1 likes to play down : her status as a high - society sweetheart			1
' for while @entity18 is from @entity69 , and @entity70 from @entity71 , @entity1 hails from @entity72 , via @entity73			0
' on her mother , @entity76 's , side , @entity52 's grandfather is the former @entity79 chairman sir @entity78 , founder of the 1960s pirate radio station @entity80			0
meanwhile her father @entity81 , a property - developer , had a grandfather who was a politician ( @entity83 , 1st @entity84 ) and his aunt , @entity85 , was a society beauty who was friends with @entity88			2
with her parent 's social standing , @entity52 and her older sisters @entity89 and @entity91 became accustomed to rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous from a young age			1
@entity96 is @entity52 's godmother while their mother 's friendship with @entity100 meant they also became close to @entity102 and @entity103			0
they were all privately educated with @entity52 attending @entity105 for girls near @entity107 then the boarding school @entity109			2
it was while she was at school her potential to become a supermodel was clocked by @entity114 , the ceo of @entity115 who once plucked @entity18 from obscurity			1
her daughter happened to be @entity52 's best friend			2
privileged background : with her older sisters , @entity91 , left , also a model , and @entity89 , who were all privately educated at @entity125 's top schools as @entity52 revealed to the telegraph : ' i 've been best - friends with @entity129 , daughter of @entity114 since i was five			1
@entity100 saw me when she came to our school and @entity132 introduced us			0
i had never thought about modelling before , and it just happened			0
' @entity114 also marked @entity52 's older sister @entity91 for success and her modelling career took off first			1
while @entity52 did the odd modelling job in her youth , @entity137 did n't officially sign her until 2009 , when she was aged 17			2
by that time @entity91 , six years her senior , had already made a name for herself and had starred in campaigns for @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
@entity52 's break out campaign was for @entity6 where she posed alongside another rising star - @entity149 actor @entity148			1
she then became the face of @entity6 in 2012			2
rising stars : one of her first campaigns was for @entity6 with actor @entity148 work with @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 followed as well as taking to the runway for designers including @entity159 and becoming a magazine cover star			2
now everywhere the model goes , cameras are sure to follow , as she parties with her friends such as @entity164 and @entity165 and is usually happy to strike a kooky pose			0
speculation on her love life is also rife with rumored romances with @entity171 's @entity170 and musician @entity172			0
@entity175 , fashion director at online boutique my - wardrobe.com explains @entity52 's appeal : ' she has this unique striking look , which is almost part @entity179 , but then mixed with an elfin quirkiness			2
there 's a rarity about her look , which has put her on the map and into countless campaigns and runways			0
' kooky : when not working , the 20 - year - old is known for her dressed down style and larking around meanwhile @entity10 editor @entity191 described her as : ' one of those girls who combine energy , wit , enthusiasm and the kind of edgy beauty that marks her out from the general pool of beautiful models			1
' but while she 's currently the most sought after face in fashion , @entity52 has admitted she has other ambitions - acting			1
so while for now she 's dominating catwalks and covers , it might not be long till she 's also a regular on the silver screen			0
eyebrows have it : @entity52 has been described as having ' an edgy beauty that marks her out from the general pool of beautiful models '			0

@entity52 was born into a privileged @entity125 high society family
20 - year - old followed sister @entity91 into modelling career and has been hailed as new @entity18
like @entity18 , she was discovered by @entity114 - as she was best friends with her daughter at private school
she has already become face of @entity6 , graced cover of @entity10 and was most in - demand catwalk model at @entity3
