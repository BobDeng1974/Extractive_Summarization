by @entity0 a pioneering scientist hailed as the ' godfather of ecstasy ' for creating the dance drug in its modern form has died aged 88			1
for more than 40 years @entity6 experimented at his home in @entity8 , @entity9 , testing his chemical creations on himself , friends and family before they could be outlawed			1
last night his wife and research partner , @entity14 , said he had died peacefully while listening to @entity16 meditation music after being diagnosed with liver cancer			1
@entity18 : dr @entity6 refined the composition of @entity20 , which had been created in 1912 , and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today			1
in just a few years it flooded nightclubs venerated : though a controversial figure for many , dr @entity6 was revered by those in favour of legalisation thanking his fans for their support , she wrote : ' @entity33 died today , at exactly 5 o'clock in the afternoon			1
' he was surrounded by family and caretakers and @entity16 meditation music , and his going was graceful , with almost no struggle at all			2
thanks to all of you , and @entity40			0
' she previously wrote : ' @entity33 knows that he 's dying , but that does n't bother him			0
' he does n't know he has cancer of the liver , and there 's no need for him to know ; that knowledge would give him nothing useful			1
peaceful life : dr @entity6 with his wife and research partner @entity14 , who announced his death ' after all , as he has said , " we all have to die of something ! " ' dr @entity55 refined the composition of @entity20 , which had been created in @entity57 in 1912 , and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today			1
in just a few years the drug had flooded the nightclubs of the world and was closely associated with the party island of @entity65			1
but the early life of dr @entity6 , the son of a @entity68 immigrant , was more humble and mainstream			0
after gaining a doctorate in biochemistry from the @entity72 , he began working for the giant @entity73 in the late 1950s			1
while he developed industrial chemicals in his day job - including the world 's first biodegradable pesticide - his time off became increasingly devoted to researching psychoactive compounds			1
he synthesised and fine - tuned hundreds of drugs , most famously methyl - enedioxy - methylamphetamine ( @entity20 )			1
although the drug was more than half a century old , he was the first person to extensively test its effects on the brain			1
he was astounded by the results - and word of the formula quickly spread around the world			2
he became celebrated among those campaigning for drugs to be legalised , and wrote several books			0
career : the scientist , from @entity9 , began his long career at the @entity73 in the 1950s the drug shot its way into national headlines after the death of @entity101 teenager @entity100 , below , who took just one tablet at her 18th birthday party in 1995			1
an inquest heard she died of swelling on the brain because she drank too much water to counter the effects of the drug			1
toxicologist professor @entity110 told the inquest : ' if @entity100 had taken the drug alone she might well have survived			2
if she had drunk the amount of water alone she would have survived			0
' the verdict - used as ammunition by both sides of the drugs debate - was all too common			2
although ecstasy has been mentioned on dozens of death certificates , it is notoriously difficult to determine whether the drug alone is responsible because of other factors			2
the debate has since shifted to more powerful drugs in the same family , which are often sold as ecstasy with devastating results			0
in october an inquest heard how @entity132 car welder @entity131 , 30 , and his friend @entity133 , 21 , died within minutes of each other after taking up to five times a lethal dose of @entity136 ( @entity136 ) - almost certainly without realising what it was			1
a spokesman for drug advice service @entity140 said : ' a big problem with ecstasy is that it ’s rarely pure			2
sometimes , there is no mdma at all			0
sometimes , it contains other drugs , like @entity136 , which can be fatal			0
' regardless of what it looks like and what it is called , you ca n’t be sure what ’s in a pill or a powder and you ca n’t predict how you ’ll react			0
' but he became a controversial figure after the death of @entity100 , an @entity101 schoolgirl who died after taking a single tablet of ecstasy at her 18th birthday party			2
a 2001 profile in the @entity161 described him as a grandfather - of - five who walked with a fragile shuffle , drove a battered @entity164 and had passion for @entity166 which included playing the viola			2
at the time - when fears over the drug in @entity170 were at their height - he said : ' if they keep it a @entity176 drug it is sad but i am heartened there has been a debate over lessening controls			1
' it demonstrates a slow shifting of attitude			0
it may take time but @entity170 will eventually realise there 's no danger from ecstasy			0
he added : ' i think it 's very healthy to explore the legalisation of cannabis , to see if it helps or hurts			0
the real trouble comes from the social damage done by enforcing these unfair laws which break up families when drug users are jailed			2
' people are hurt far more by that than by the drugs			0
' at one time he was venerated by the @entity204 establishment , writing the classic reference book @entity206 , a @entity207			0
but when dr @entity6 pronounced his personal belief in psychedelics and advocated that all drugs should be legalised , officials changed their tune			0
federal drugs agents raided his lab , took away most of his equipment and revoked his permit			0
in 1995 , dr @entity6 expressed regret that the drug - banned in the @entity204 in 1986 - had attracted controversy			1
' these rave scenes have added kindling to the fire of governmental disapproval , ' he said			0
' its very excellent potential for being used as medicine has been badly jeopardised			0

pioneering scientist died peacefully of cancer at home in @entity8 , @entity9
he famously tested creations on himself before they could be made *illegal*
in late 1970s he synthesised compound closely linked to modern - day @entity20
drug has *remained* vastly *popular* for decades despite huge controversy
he always *insisted* it was safe and hoped it would treat mental illness
