the ' @entity0 ' has gone political with greens senator @entity1 tipping the bucket on herself today in @entity3			1
the mercury was sitting at barely four degrees which she joined the @entity8 doing so , she also uttered words which would resonate with many @entity11 voters , saying ' i think every good politician needs a good shower '			0
the @entity0 was established to raise awareness of @entity16 ( @entity16 ) and has spread globally			0

will prime minister @entity54 , who 's not averse to water sports , be down for a dunking or will opposition leader @entity57 get in first ? the senator went on @entity60 to announce her support for @entity16 research and to call out fellow politicians the rules for the challenge vary but in principle , the idea is to fill a bucker with cold water and ice , then tip it over your head or have it tipped on you and then issue a challenge for up to three other people to do the same withn 48 hours			1
if they ca n't , then they must make a donation to charity			0
