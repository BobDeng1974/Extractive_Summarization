naturists are being told to cover up on the nationally - renowned sands at @entity12 , near @entity13 , north @entity14 , after complaints about lewd and anti-social behaviour			1
the beach , which is part of @entity20 , was the setting for the final scene of the @entity24 winning film when @entity25 survives a shipwreck			1
it has acted as concern mounts locally over incidents of public indecency on the stunning stretch of the east coast , which attracts about 500,000 people every year			1
the ban comes after a @entity47 campaign was launched in the summer of 2010 to crack down on sex pests roaming the sands			1
locals have complained about people having sex in public and propositioning beach - goers			2
one campaigner wrote in august 2010 : ' my last three visits to the beach have seen me propositioned twice			1
' i 've witnessed gay sex in the sand dunes and men walking around " playing "			2
' i 've reported this to the wardens and local pcso but nothing has been done			2
' the beach used to be a lovely place to go but now it 's just a haven for swingers and perverts who wo n't take no for an answer			2
' @entity75 said at the time that officers were investigating reports that beach - goers had been acting in an ' inappropriate manner '			2
the stunning beach was used for the final scene of @entity5 ( pictured ) conservation manager @entity82 said ' persistent anti-social behaviour ' forced them into the ban the western section of @entity12 beach has been a designated destination for naturists for a number of years and is flagged up on swinging and dogging websites			1
@entity82 , conservation manager at the @entity20 , said last night : ' it is sad that we have been forced to take this step due to the persistent anti-social behaviour of a minority of people			1
' the management and control of these activities has been an increasing concern to me and my team who look after the reserve so we have had to take action to ban all nudism			1
' we have consulted with the police and discussed the issues and options			2
' the decision has been made to implement a total ban for the better management and future safety of all our visitors			1
' signs will be erected to highlight the new order and @entity20 wardens will be patrolling the beach to ensure visitors comply with the new policy			1
they have been instructed to tell any naturists to put their clothes on and if they refuse they face being arrested and prosecuted			2
a @entity47 group was set up three years ago trying to ban naturists from @entity29 @entity129 , which includes the beach , is managed by @entity20			1
the dunes are owned and managed by the estate			0
the beautiful beach is owned by the @entity134 and managed by @entity135			0
both organisations were consulted over the decision but naturist groups have reacted angrily to the news			0
@entity140 , a spokesman for @entity142 , said : ' many of our members enjoy coming to this beautiful part of the country to sunbathe on the beach and socialise with like - minded people without causing any problems			1
' unfortunately some people see being nude as an excuse to misbehave and it is a great shame that a small minority of trouble - makers ruin it for all of us			1
' these people should be dealt with by the police			0
if 20 people out of 20,000 in a football stadium cause trouble they do n't close the whole stadium			0
' so it is a shame that the @entity20 has come to make this decision and we would like to open some dialogue with them about this			1
