one twin uses an @entity1 , plays video games and dances to @entity5 tunes			0
the other has significant , possibly permanent , problems walking and talking			0
the delicate separation 10 years ago of conjoined twins from the @entity10 was n’t perfect , but the boys ’ mother says their very survival is reason enough to celebrate the anniversary			1
' when they were born , the doctors at home told me , ‘ ' you have to choose which one is to live '' , ’ @entity16 said			1
' i said , '' i can not choose that ''			0
the doctors here did not ask me to choose			2
on monday , the formerly - conjoined twins , 12 , are celebrating the ten year anniversary of the risky surgery that separated them precarious : the boys , seen aged 17 - months - old en route to @entity33 from the @entity10 for their separation , would have died if they remained conjoined , doctors said recovery : the pair sit up and play just four months after the risky operation that separated at @entity44 in @entity33 in december 2004 the boys , now 12 , were born joined at the top of their heads , unable to sit up , stand straight , eat normally — or see each other			1
once their case was accepted by the @entity50 at @entity44 in the @entity51 , leaving @entity27 and @entity52 was not an option			1
' if they had n’t come to us when they did , they would have just withered away and died , ' said dr. @entity58 , the boys ’ pediatrician , who plans to be at the hospital monday to mark the separation anniversary			2
' i am extremely proud of having been a part of this			0
' i ’m a little disappointed with some of the outcome but , clearly , to see how these kids have survived and are for the most part thriving , is really wonderful			0
' @entity44 ’s president and ceo , dr. @entity70 , said : ' we are honored to have played a part in helping these boys develop into the unique individuals they are today			1
' the boys were separated on aug. 4 , 2004 , in an operation that climaxed a then - unusual ' staged separation ' that took four surgeries over nine months			1
when it was over , dr. @entity79 , the boys ’ plastic surgeon , told the mother : ' you ’re now the mother of two boys			1
' grown - up : @entity27 ( left ) uses a wheelchair and leg braces , with limited use of his arm and leg			1
@entity26 ( right ) is very active , his mother said , but can be hard to understand verbally @entity26 , who never left the area after the operation and now raises the boys in @entity32 , said she throws birthday parties twice a year — on april 21 , the day they were born , and on aug. 4			1
' the historical treatment was basically to sacrifice one to save the other , ' said the lead surgeon , dr. @entity101			0
' the staged separation turned out to be obviously very successful			0
' he and his team have since separated four other sets of joined - at - the - head twins in @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
the @entity26 boys shared a ' bridge ' of brain , 5 or 6 centimeters long , that had to be divided			2
' when you get beyond 1 centimeter or 2 centimeters , one or both kids takes a hit , ' @entity101 said			0
eventually there was some degeneration of @entity27 ’s right parietal lobe , which controls the left side , @entity101 said			2
playtime : @entity26 ( left ) acts like a big brother to @entity27 ( right ) and loves to read to him @entity27 suffered seizures , now controlled with medication , and has limited use of his left arm and leg			1
@entity27 uses a wheelchair and leg braces , and there ’s hope he ’ll eventually be able to walk on his own , though @entity101 doubts there will be a full recovery			1
as for speech , his mother said he can utter just a word or two at a time , such as ' bye ' and ' thank you '			0
he spends the school day in classes for kids with multiple disabilities and gets occupational , physical and speech therapy			0
she said @entity26 , who can be difficult to understand when he speaks , also gets some special instruction in communication			2
but unlike @entity27 , he is an attention - seeking preteen who leaps up to high - five visitors and is quick to show them his favorite video games			2
' he ’s kind of a delightful kid , ' said @entity58 , who is chief of genetics at the @entity50			0
' i think he ’s going to be a typical adult			0

@entity26 is very active and acts as @entity27 's older brother , but can be hard to understand
