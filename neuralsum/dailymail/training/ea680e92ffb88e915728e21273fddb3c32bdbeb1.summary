by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 09:51 est , 3 november 2012 the @entity1 has been canceled after residents protested plans for it to go ahead in the aftermath of @entity7 's widespread destruction			1
mayor @entity8 said yesterday evening that the annual 26.2 - mile race will not be held this sunday , despite workers spending the days after @entity7 preparing the course			1
the mayor had previously defended his stance to have the race to proceed , despite the fact that millions across the five boroughs remain without clean water , food , and electricity			2
the @entity1 was finally canceled yesterday evening after residents protested plans for it to go ahead in @entity31 yesterday ... preparations : workers yesterday continued to set up the finish line area of the @entity1 in @entity31 , just hours before the annual event was called off ready for action : @entity1 organisers were preparing for the race right up until yesterday afternoon should the @entity1 go ahead , despite thousands still suffering black - outs ? ' @entity43 has been an integral part of @entity24 's life for 40 years and is an event tens of thousands of @entity24 participate in and millions more watch , ' mayor @entity8 said in the statement			1
' while holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort , it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division			1
' he added : ' we would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants , and so we have decided to cancel it			0
' we can not allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track			1
' the race is likely to be held at a later date although no details were given as to when this would take place			0
it is also unclear whether any of the nearly 50,000 runners who were expected to compete in sunday ’s marathon , thousands of whom traveled to @entity24 from other countries , would be compensated in any way			1
the move to cancel the event is historic as it has been held every year since 1970 , including in 2001 when the marathon took place just two months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks			2
in @entity84 yesterday ... devastation : @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 weep in their @entity84 neighborhood where many houses were completely destroyed salvaging memories : members of the @entity94 family sort through photos and other personal items they found in the remains of their @entity84 home @entity1 material ? mayor @entity8 toured a storm damaged area of @entity102 in @entity84 before claiming the marathon had become a ' source of controversy and division ' race is off : the mayor insisted the @entity1 would not interfere with the recovery of the city but decided to cancel it after pressure but the cancellation was almost inevitable after opposition , from runners as well as politicians and residents of the worst affected areas , intensified as days wore on post-storm			1
at a news conference on friday , mayor @entity8 defended his initial decision to go ahead with the marathon as a way to raise money for the city and boost morale less than a week after @entity7 knocked out power and left a death toll of 109 people			1
he noted that his predecessor , @entity130 , went ahead with the @entity1 two months after 9/11			0
‘ if you go back to 9/11 , @entity131 made the right decision in those days to run the marathon and pull people together , ' @entity8 said			1
the mayor added that the marathon 's organizers are ‘ running this race to help @entity24 , and the donations from all the runners in the club will be a great help for our relief efforts			1
’ earlier this week , the mayor said the race would n't siphon off resources from the storm recovery , noting electricity is expected to be restored to all of @entity151 by race day , freeing up ‘ an enormous number of police			1
’ lost everything : a woman is helped along by family members in in @entity158 , @entity159 , which was ravaged by fire during the storm devastated : @entity162 was still being felt on friday at @entity163 everything lost : two women embrace outside a home destroyed by flooding on the south side of @entity84 carnage : mounds of debris pile up in the street in the heavily damaged @entity173 neighborhood the @entity174 , which partners with @entity176 for each race , could not immediately be reached			0
business owner @entity178 agreed with @entity8 ’s desire to continue with the marathon			2
@entity178 , who owns @entity181 on @entity151 ’s @entity182 , said the weekend after the superstorm was ‘ the perfect time to have it			0
’ he said : ‘ i do n’t think the timing could have been better			0
’ runners along the 26.2 - mile course pass right next to @entity178 ’s bar			2
the course runs from the @entity190 on hard - hit @entity84 to @entity31 , sending runners through all five boroughs			2
the course of the marathon was n't going to be changed if it went ahead on sunday , as there was little damage along the route			1
even before @entity203 's announcement this evening , as organisers put finishing touches to the finish line , @entity84 residents were crying as they saw their devastated neighborhood			1
residents - some of whom have had to wade through local dumpsters to find food and supplies - were demanding to know why generators used for the race were not being used to help those in desperate need			2
gathering belongings : @entity94 tries to salvage some personal items from the basement of his parent 's @entity84 home , which was destroyed washed ashore : a boat is washed up and left on @entity220 in @entity84 after the superstorm broken homes : houses in @entity220 on @entity84 left destroyed by @entity7 aftermath : a limousine sits atop another vehicle in @entity220 on @entity84 a third generator would not even have been used unless there was an emergency - causing even more friction between organisers and residents over what mayor @entity8 considered an emergency			1
for days officials in the storm - ravaged tri-state area insisted that plans to go ahead with the @entity1 would not affect recovery efforts , but they were in the minority			1
congressman @entity241 , whose district includes the devastated borough of @entity84 , was one of several prominent politicians who earlier yesterday voiced his fury that the annual race was going ahead , even while many on the island are without water , food , and electricity			0
‘ there ’s no question i ’m angry about it , ’ the representative said , just hours before the event was called off			2
‘ the city of @entity24 is talking about getting water out of the @entity258 and getting ready for the marathon			1
we ’re pulling bodies out of the water			0
’ speaking on the today show , @entity264 , who represents the 13th district of @entity24 , said that residents of the borough are barely coping in the wake of @entity7 , and the last thing on their minds is a race			1
‘ there are those walking the street and they seem almost hopeless , ’ he said			0
‘ they ’ve lost everything and there ’s nowhere for them to go			0
' more than 100 homes were destroyed in @entity158 , @entity159			0
flatbed trucks that originally helped with rescue operations had been diverted to prepare for the marathon , which is now canceled hauled away : garbage men disposed dozens of shopping carts full of ruined goods on wednesday at the @entity290 supermarket in @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity24 still a long way to go : a woman walks past debris piled in the streets of @entity297 , @entity298 postman @entity299 delivers the mail to a pharmacy damaged by floodwaters in @entity297 , @entity298 nevertheless , the mayor 's office had said : ‘ our recover efforts are ongoing and none of those will be impacted by the marathon			1
no resources will be diverted			2
’ ' there are people right now that have no heat who have no food and are sitting in the dark			0
' to say that we have enough resources just is n’t accurate			0
there ’s a lot of unanswered questions			0
we feel that no one understands us			0
' @entity84 councilman @entity323 echoed @entity264 ’s anger			0
' the notion of diverting even one police officer , one first responder , one asset away from this carnage , is beyond irrational , ’ he told the @entity329			0
earlier , mayor @entity8 said he saw none of the damage or power outtages as insurmountable , and defended the decision to hold the race , insisting resources would n't be diverted from storm victims			1
he noted at a news conference on thursday that electricity was expected to be restored to all of @entity151 by race day , freeing up ‘ up an enormous number of police '			0
‘ this city is a city where we have to go on , ’ he said			2
but many @entity24 did n't feel that accurately reflected the current situation			1
a petition on @entity348 asked @entity8 and other officials to postpone the @entity350 until the spring of next year			0
‘ police , fire , and other emergency services should not be diverted to the @entity1 during this time of crisis , ’ the petition read			1
‘ this event is always a positive event and it should not be turned into a hugely negative drain on city resources			2
’ some critics also questioned whether the marathon should go ahead at all			0
the marathon would have brought an estimated $ 340million into the city			2
organizers would have used it as a backdrop to raise money for recovery efforts			0
race organizer @entity174 will donate $ 1million to the fund and said more than $ 1.5million in pledges already had been secured from sponsors			0
