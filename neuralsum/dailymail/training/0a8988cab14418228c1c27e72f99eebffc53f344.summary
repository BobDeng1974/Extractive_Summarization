sex traffickers are using @entity4 to ' enslave ' women , forcing them into prostitution and other criminal activity , the head of the @entity2 policing agency has warned			1
@entity8 , the director of @entity9 , said that advertisements on social media sites promising work in childcare or cleaning were used by criminal gangs to draw in vulnerable young women			1
he claimed the traffickers then used internet technology such as webcams to monitor their victims , controlling their movements and ensuring they turned up to work in brothels or other criminal enterprises			1
@entity8 ( pictured ) , the director of @entity9 , said that advertisements on social media sites were used by criminal gangs to draw in vulnerable young women and called for the ' culture of policing ' to change speaking to the @entity27 think tank in @entity29 , mr @entity8 said the use of modern technology had enabled the ' industrialisation ' of the traffickers ' activities , allowing them to control many more problems			1
' @entity4 is effectively being used in many cases as the means to attract and then enslave vulnerable young women , ' he said			2
' they ( the traffickers ) are using the modern technological tools to more efficiently monitor an increasing number of victims			1
' so instead of paying them a visit every day they can use the webchat services but also webcam cameras to confirm that they are where they should be , they are in that brothel waiting for the next customer			0
' in the past , the pimps and traffickers had to do that by physically visiting them			2
now they can just do it at the click of a button and therefore control 50 victims much more easily and readily in virtual form			2
' what that allows therefore is a sort of industrialisation of the problem			0
single traffickers and pimps can control many more victims			1
' mr @entity8 said that people trafficking was regarded as a ' low - risk , high profit ' activity by criminal gangs generating an estimated Â£ 100billion - a - year for organised crime			2
mr @entity8 claimed the traffickers use internet technology such as webcams to monitor their victims , controlling their movements and ensuring they turned up to work in brothels ( file picture , posed by model ) up to 36 million people worldwide are thought to be held in modern slavery - at least 500,000 in @entity2			1
most of the victims in @entity2 are from @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 with the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity94 the main destinations for trafficking			0
mr @entity8 said there needed to be much greater co-operation among international law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem			1
he said : ' as things currently stand , organised crime groups are going about the business of modern slavery and with little fear of being caught and pursued			0
we urgently need to do much better			0
' the international law enforcement community needs to trust each other a bit more			0
' there is no point in sitting on a vital piece of information in one country if it can break a syndicate spread across five or more others			0
' the culture of policing must change			0
