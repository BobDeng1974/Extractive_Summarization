by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 21 january 2013 a collision of black holes - or neutron stars - could have been responsible for a blast of radiation that struck the @entity6 in the @entity7			1
but our medieval ancestors - and the planet - had a lucky escape			1
a new study by a team of @entity15 scientists suggests that the blast of radiation that hit the @entity6 between the years 774 and 775 was caused by the collision of two ' compact stellar remnants ' such as black holes , neutron stars or white dwarfs			1
the collision of two black holes between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from us would have caused a very short but very intense blast of energy , say researchers in @entity28 when this happens , say astronomers @entity30 and @entity32 of the @entity33 of the @entity34 in @entity28 , an intense blast of energy is released in the form of gamma rays , which are the most energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes visible light			1
these huge bursts of energy are , however , very short : they last less than two seconds			2
and , suggest the scientists , this massive collision of heavenly bodies happened a very long way away from @entity6 - between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from our @entity46 that means that by the time the radiation arrived at our home planet , it would have been absorbed by our atmosphere , and there would be no obvious signs of the massive event that had happened far away in the universe			1
if the gamma ray burst had been much closer to the @entity6 , it would have caused significant harm to the biosphere , ' said dr @entity32			2
that explains why there are no records of any unusual sightings in the sky from that period			2
other big celestial events were recorded : the appearance of @entity71 's comet in our skies in 1066 was recorded for posterity in the @entity75			2
@entity71 's comet features in the @entity75 that commemorates the @entity77 in 1066 and the @entity78 researchers had suggested that an entry in the @entity81 that describes a ' red crucifix ' that was seen after sunset might have been a supernova			2
a black hole is a region where gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape - not even light			0
but a black hole is far from empty - it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the @entity46 squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of @entity95			0
these giant black holes can collide : once they come so close that they can not escape each other 's gravity , they will merge to become one bigger black hole			0
even when simulating this event on powerful computers , we can not fully understand it			1
however , we do know that a black hole merger would produce tremendous energy and send massive ripples through the space - time fabric of the universe			0
however , that dates from 776 - too late to have been a visible result of the collision between the black holes thousands of light years away			0
but although our medieval ancestors were n't aware of the vast celestial event , it did leave its mark on our planet			0
last year researchers in @entity122 found that some ancient cedar trees had an unusual level of carbon - 14 , a radioactive material that can be used to date artefacts of up to 50,000 years old			1
and in @entity129 there was a spike in levels of a form of beryllium , a rare element			1
both of these unusual concentrations were found to date from between 774 and 775 - precisely the period in which the intense blast of energy would have hit the @entity6			1
fortunately , such events are very rare			0
dr @entity32 says that we are unlikely to experience such an event any time soon			0
carbon - 14 dating techniques suggest that only one occurence of a huge blast of radiation hitting the @entity6 has occured in the past 3,000 years - the one our eighth - century ancestors lived through			1
but our modern lifestyles mean we are much more vulnerable to such an event			0
says dr @entity32 : ' even thousands of light years away , a similar event could cause havoc with the sensitive electronic systems that advanced societies have come to depend on			0

blast of radiation left traces in @entity129 ice and ancient @entity122 trees
if it happened now it could knock out the computers we rely on
