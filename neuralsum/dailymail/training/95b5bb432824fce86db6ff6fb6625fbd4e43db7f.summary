@entity0 resigned amid allegations he helped cover up the behaviour of paedophile @entity3 a leading @entity5 prelate quit his post as a bishop yesterday , a week after being accused of covering up for a paedophile priest			1
former archbishop of york @entity0 surrendered his position as a bishop in the @entity12 after a judge found he had protected the very reverend @entity3 from exposure , investigation and prosecution			1
but while stepping down , @entity0 – who covered up for the sex abuser cleric while serving as number two in the hierarchy of the church – stopped short of apologising for the priests ’s actions			2
he said in a statement : ‘ after much prayerful and considered thought i wrote at the beginning of the week to the @entity25 and in the light of the @entity28 report i have submitted my resignation as honorary assistant @entity30 , now @entity31 and the @entity32 , with immediate effect			0
‘ this ends my nearly 50 years of formal ministry in the @entity5 , which i have always sought to serve with dedication			0
' i will certainly continue to pray for the important ongoing work with survivors			0
’ @entity0 ’s position as a bishop in @entity42 came into question following publication of an inquiry report last week in which judge @entity46 found that ‘ because of the actions he took , and his inaction on other occasions , opportunities were missed for an investigation which may have led to a prosecution during @entity3 ’s lifetime ’ , the judge ’s report added : ‘ his concern for the welfare of @entity3 seems to have been paramount in his response to these allegations			1
’ last week @entity0 , who served as archbishop of york from 1995 to 2005 , greeted the publication of judge @entity46 ’s report by calling it ‘ flawed ’ and a ‘ disappointment ’ and offering only qualified regret for the @entity68 cover - up			2
the report found that @entity3 , who rose to become @entity71 , in charge of the city ’s cathedral , was a lifelong paedophile who had attracted complaints in every decade from the 1950s			1
it suggested the suicide in 1989 of a former @entity79 choirboy may have been connected to abuse by @entity3 in the 1970s , and it said a complaint laid against @entity3 by @entity82 ’s organist in 1989 was ignored			1
in 1999 an @entity84 bishop reported to @entity0 complaints of abuse by @entity3 in @entity84 during the 1960s			1
@entity0 reported back that @entity3 , by then retired in @entity88 , was desperately ill with cancer , lived a ‘ hermit - like ’ existence , and it was impossible that he could pose a threat to any child			1
@entity3 allegedly abused children for decades he also told @entity96 about the allegations in a face - to - face meeting and declined to involve police			1
but at the time , the judge found , @entity3 was regularly taking services in @entity102 and had access to rooms used by choirboys			2
witnesses to the inquiry said he had been seen putting a chocolate bar into one choirboy ’s pocket and had invited another boy to his home			0
the report listed seven breaches of church safeguarding rules by @entity0 in 1999 , five in 2003 and six in 2004			2
in 2013 the @entity68 affair was thrown into the open when former @entity82 choirboy @entity119 gave detailed evidence of the abuse he had suffered			0
however @entity3 died in 2007 , his reputation intact			2
the present archbishop of @entity88 , the most reverend @entity123 , said yesterday : ‘ i respect the prayerful decision made by my predecessor lord @entity125			0
i am deeply saddened by his decision			0
‘ it did not come as a surprise to me when on the day the inquiry report was published @entity0 said that “ it is matter of great regret to me that 12 years ago when the non-specific anonymous allegations were first made in @entity82 , the church and i myself were not more proactive in seeking out and / or assisting a reluctant complainant			1
nor is it any comfort that other organisations were no more diligent at that time when dealing with similar situations ”			0
’ archbishop @entity123 added : ‘ as the old saying goes “ to err is human , to forgive is divine ”			0
‘ the inquiry into the alleged abuses by @entity3 led by judge @entity46 has made its recommendations and these now need to be considered and action taken in a thoughtful and measured manner to ensure the church can be a safer place for all , ’ dr @entity123 said .			0
