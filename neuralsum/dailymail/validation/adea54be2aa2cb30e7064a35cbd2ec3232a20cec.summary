@entity0 won their first knockout match ever in a @entity3 as they cruised to a nine - wicket victory over @entity5 in their quarter - final on wednesday			1
in what proved to be @entity10 and @entity12 ’s final one - day international matches for @entity5 , @entity0 showed they are not a side willing to hold on to the tag of ‘ chokers ’			1
an immense display with the ball , from spinners @entity18 and @entity20 , and in the field helped @entity0 bowl out their opponents for a paltry 133 , before the under - pressure @entity26 hit a sublime unbeaten 78			1
@entity20 leaps in celebration as he claims the wicket of @entity29 on his way to a hat - trick @entity0 celebrate the opening wicket of @entity33 in their dominant quarter - final win over @entity5 @entity37 fast bowler @entity36 jumps for joy after catching the edge of @entity41 opener @entity33 keeper @entity26 claims the catch as @entity5 's first wicket falls for just three runs with all the pre-game talk being dominated about @entity0 ’s failure to win a single knock - out match since their reintroduction into international cricket 20 years ago , they looked like a team intent on proving they have the ability and nerve to go all the way			1
after @entity57 was ruled out for rest of the tournament , @entity29 became only the second player ever to make his one - day international debut in a @entity3 match as he took his place			1
following @entity5 winning the toss , captain @entity64 drew a likeness between the mystery spinner and @entity68			0
but it was tough introduction to international cricket for the 19 - year - old as @entity5 wilted under the pressure of a knockout game , a scenario @entity0 are more than accustomed too			1
at a sun - bathed @entity77 , choosing to bat first seemed like it gave the @entity81 finalists the edge but they collapsed to 4 - 2 after just four overs			0
@entity84 showed intent to reach 41 from 48 deliveries against a quality @entity88 attack leg - spinner @entity18 celebrates after taking a catch off his own bowling to dismiss @entity84 @entity33 , who had been pushed to the top of the batting order in an attempt to take the attack to the @entity88 bowlers , fell to the increasingly impressive @entity36			2
@entity97 took a sensational one - handed diving catch , at the second attempt , after @entity33 edged behind for just three			0
and fellow opener @entity100 fell for a duck as he edged a sharp @entity103 delivery that was caught by @entity104 at slip , despite the ball dying on him			0
@entity108 then joined @entity10 as the pair looked to resurrect and rebuild @entity5 ’s innings			1
despite having four consecutive hundreds to his name coming into the match , @entity10 looked more like a player terribly out of touch and searching for runs			2
having taken 16 balls to score his first run , it took 42 to hit his first boundary as the @entity88 pushed for further breakthroughs			0
at the other end , @entity84 was batting far more fluently and despite his partner ’s troubles , @entity5 were finding their way back into the quarter - final			1
however , the introduction of the @entity88 spinners proved to be the turning point			0
@entity10 , in his last odi match for his country , attempts to hold the inning together as wickets fall also in his final @entity3 match , @entity12 fell cheaply to the @entity88 spinner for four @entity12 trudges off the @entity77 after @entity104 took the catch from @entity18 's bowling @entity88 all - rounder @entity20 celebrates as he takes the wicket of @entity5 captain @entity139 @entity10 's incredible form continued as the @entity41 veteran got off to another top start but after three successive hundreds at the @entity3 , @entity144 ended his innings on 45 off 96 balls the constantly excitable @entity18 took a simple caught - and - bowled as @entity84 threw away his wicket to bring @entity12 to the crease			1
despite being 69 - 3 , with two @entity41 legends at the crease playing alongside each other in an odi for the 150th time , there was a feeling that they could still post a competitive total			0
but having made just four off 16 balls , @entity12 walked off the cricket field for the last time in his career as @entity18 had him caught at short midwicket			0
and it was @entity0 ’s fifth bowler , @entity20 , who caused the greatest damage as he became the eighth player in @entity3 history to take a hat - trick			1
a poor shot from @entity64 , after he looked set , as he tried to whip a flighted delivery from outside off through midwicket was the 30 - year - old ’s first scalp from the last ball of his eighth over			0
@entity175 walked after the thinnest of edges was caught by @entity97 before debutant @entity29 tried to play around the ball and was trapped plumb in front			0
@entity26 opens up his shoulders as the @entity0 opener takes to the @entity41 bowling the left - hander sweeps on his way to 78 runs from just 57 balls as the @entity37 chase down 133 @entity97 , keen to hit his way back in to form , celebrates reaching a sublime half - century with @entity10 ’s batting partners deserting him the left - hander attempted to open up but having made 45 he holed out to deep mid-wicket off @entity144			1
as @entity5 ’s leading run - scorer trudged off the @entity77 in his last one - day international for his country there was a sudden downpour , as if even those in heaven were crying tears of sadness			2
even with @entity0 ’s dismal knockout record , failing to score 134 seemed even beyond them and when @entity202 hit the first ball of the innings for four the omens seemed to be good for them			2
despite having a previous high score of just 26 thus far in the @entity3 , @entity97 played fluently , hitting 12 fours on the way to making 78 off 57 - balls			0
at the close of the match , @entity88 captain @entity211 asked for @entity12 ’s shirt , a sign that every player knew the magnitude of losing a great player			0
for @entity0 they executed their game plan perfectly , ticking every single box possible to show the watching world that they are serious @entity3 contenders .			2

@entity5 was bowled out cheaply for 133 from 37.2 overs
@entity18 took four wickets and @entity20 claimed a hat - trick
@entity0 had never before won a @entity3 knockout match
@entity10 was out for 45 in his final odi for @entity5
*proteas* reached the target off 18 overs with nine wickets in hand
