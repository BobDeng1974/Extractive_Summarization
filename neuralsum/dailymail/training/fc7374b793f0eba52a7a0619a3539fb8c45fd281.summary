it 's as indicative of an @entity3 summer as the first swallow or the scent of mown grass			1
i have been looking forward to this new series - the fourth - as keenly as if it were a hot man and a first date			1
in fact , do n’t even bother asking me on a date on a tuesday night from now on , because i will be glued to the telly , lost in a safe , mummy world of greaseproof paper , icing sugar and floral fairy - cake cases			1
home comforts : bake off judge @entity20 , left , reminds @entity0 of her mother @entity21 the only challenge will be whether the oven was hot enough or the crème patissiere has curdled			1
will @entity20 be in an outrageous outfit from @entity26 that will do more for the @entity28 economy than any amount of quantitative easing ? will her fellow judge @entity31 have mellowed and managed to use less hair gel ? the @entity1 is like a drug , and i ca n't get enough of it			1
already my head is brimming with palette knives , cake tins and different types of nut			1
but the thing is , i 'm the nut			1
i have never cooked a cake on my own in my life			2
i have never owned a bag of flour or a wooden spoon			2
a rolling pin would be as unusual a sight in my immaculate home as a sofa from @entity53			2
food has been as absent in my life as a man who loves me and children			1
i am starting to realise that my life of abstention from calories is not entirely unrelated to the fact my life is now about loneliness			2
i am thin , but i am unhappy			2
i have a stainless steel kitchen island , but it is unscratched			2
a bit like me : pristine but sterile			2
in case you are unfamiliar with my neuroses , let me enlighten you			2
ca n't cook , wo n't cook : @entity0 has never baked a cake in her life i have been an anorexic since the age of 11 when my mum approached me with a breakfast in bed of warm , buttered toast and marmalade , and i shrank - fuelled by 19 magazine 's calorie - counter - as if i were @entity78 faced with @entity79			1
i grew up on @entity77 , believing women were supposed to have careers , not cookers			2
i have never owned a recipe book in my life , believing that my mum , who was a housewife and cooked everything for her seven children from scratch , was a martyr - a slave to mixing ( the only appliance she owned was a hand whisk , with a handle she had to turn ) and washing - up ( we never owned a dishwasher or a washing machine )			2
' i vowed , aged 11 , i would never cook a thing for myself , nor for a man			2
and , on the whole , i have n't ' as a teenager , my mum would proudly parade fairy cakes , rock cakes , chocolate sponges and a @entity103 cake with rough icing she said was ' a snowstorm ' , crowned with a @entity107 whose red trousers became more pink as the years went by			1
in return , i would lambast her every time she approached me with a floral plate and a teeny fork and an anxious face			2
do n't offer me that rubbish ! i do n't want to spend my life with a face flushed red from a range - i want a career ! it is anti-feminist to own a pastry brush ! and my mum and her morsels would retreat , deflated			1
i vowed , aged 11 , i would never cook a thing for myself , nor for a man			2
and , on the whole , i have n't			1
men would have to love me for who i am , what i do , not for how i filled their stomachs			0
back on tuesday evenings ; @entity0 loves the eccentricity of the @entity1 i was too good to be covered in flour			1
i wanted to go to aerobics class and lift weights , not whisk and beat until my muscles ached			0
at school i even rebelled in domestic science , saying the tea towels smelled and turned my stomach			0
and , in any case , i was a vegan , and cream oppressed animals			0
just as i was excused biology , for refusing to dissect a once - living creature , i was excused cooking and told to take extra sewing classes instead			0
cooking , to me , spelled being fat , and that was the last thing i wanted to be			0
cooking spelled mess , which , as an @entity154 sufferer , was as unwelcome as herpes to a hooker			0
even today , faced with the choice of toast and crumbs or nothing , i will choose the latter			0
but somehow , i just can not get my fill of the @entity1			0
' @entity20 , who oozes safety and forgiveness			1
nothing bad could happen while she is in charge ' perhaps the fact that the hit @entity169 series is filmed in a marquee has something to do with my addiction			0
a marquee , with its unique smell and diffused light , reminds me of the horticultural shows of my youth , when i always entered the @entity180 competition and failed			0
or perhaps it is reminiscent of weddings where the groom loves the bride and does n’t slope off to spend time with his mates before cheating on his new wife			1
perhaps , too , i love this programme because of the contestants , who are hapless and normal , do n't seem to care about their waistlines and have families to call excitedly with news after every triumph and failure			1
this programme to me is like porn : a fantasy world not of sex , but of families and normality and comfort and fires and messy kitchens			0
i never have anyone to call when things have gone wrong or right , or when i land at @entity208 after yet another long , dusty , lonely assignment abroad			0
this programme reeks of home			0
most of all , though , i love @entity212 because of @entity20 , who oozes safety and forgiveness			1
nothing bad could happen while @entity20 is in charge			1
@entity218 's dozen : the latest contestants are all ' hapless and normal ' she reminds me so much of my mum , who spent her life baking but who is now so ill and disabled she can only be given syringed warm water from a pipette			1
i want my mum back , but in the meantime i have @entity20			1
i want to tell my mum i am sorry i rejected her @entity229 sponge in favour of fitting into a size six pair of brown trousers			0
' maybe i would be a nicer person , more content , if i owned an apron ' i remember the sunday afternoon she begged me to eat a @entity238 pudding because i had been awake all night , delirious , unable to even form sentences , so emaciated was i , so insane from the anorexia , and i dashed the hot , fatty pan to the floor			0
she did n't admonish or berate me , but merely said she would fix me a poached tomato on @entity245 bread instead			1
does the new series of @entity212 disappoint ? is it as flat as a meringue that has been whisked too vigorously , or my own deflated breasts ? the hell it is ! the moment @entity254 says ' welcome to yeast ' to the eager contestants , you know that all is right in the world			1
there is a new baker 's dozen of contestants to roll around the tongue			1
summer fete feel : @entity0 loves the fact the show is set in a marquee among them are @entity268 , the student with the startling blue eyes and a desire to please ; @entity271 , who designs space satellites and is crowned master baker for the very first time ; @entity275 , the dentist for people with special needs ( was there ever a more holistic job description ? ) ; and @entity281 , the sixth - form teacher who is as big as a house			1
the comfort , the normality , oozes from them			0
a cake is deemed to have ' gone a bit pottery class ' because @entity290 the carpenter forgot to pre-heat the oven			0
but other than that , all is right in this big old scary world			0
which surely makes a nice change			0
meeting her heroine : @entity0 with @entity20 for the opening show of this series , @entity20 was wearing last summer 's @entity302 floral blazer , which tells me she has her priorities in order , and , like my mum , was brought up during the war when there were more important things to worry about than being able to buy the new @entity311 bag from @entity312			1
she is frugal , not vain			0
and i learn stuff from the @entity1 : to ' temper ' is to cool chocolate , not fly into a mood			0
maybe i would be a nicer person , more content , if i owned an apron			0
maybe when a man comes for the weekend i could get out the whisk			0
i might even contemplate buying a loose - bottomed tin and worry less about my own bottom			0
i might even download the recipes and dream of the perfect @entity325			0
the @entity1 works in the same way @entity327 does : it is a @entity28 fete on a warm afternoon			0
it 's not cool , it 's not pc , it 's a bit cheesy			1
even for women like me .			0

@entity0 has never baked but she loves the show
she likes the ' hapless and normal ' contestants who do n't ' seem to care about their waistlines '
but most of all , she 's a fan of @entity20
