by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 03:54 est , 17 january 2013 in 2007 baby @entity1 was born weighing less than a bag of sugar and measuring just six inches long			1
then , doctors had no idea why this chubby , healthy - looking baby was so small			1
now , five years on , they have finally diagnosed @entity1 with a rare type of primordial dwarfism that is known to affect only three other families in the world			1
today , @entity1 's mother @entity11 revealed the struggle she and her husband went through before getting the diagnosis - and their hopes that @entity1 can live a life that is as normal as possible			1
her mother said on this morning that at five years old , her daughter is still wearing the clothes of a six - month - old baby mrs @entity11 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , who has one other daughter who is older than @entity1 , said that when she fell pregnant with @entity1 in 2007 , everything seemed normal at first			1
then , at the six month mark , doctors noticed the baby 's measurements seemed small for dates , but were not inordinately concerned			1
' the pregnancy seemed fine , apart from a few small things , ' mrs @entity11 told @entity36 and @entity37 on the @entity38 show this morning			2
' at six months , the midwife said , " you are quite small			0
" i started going to the hospital weekly to have scans and be monitored			0
doctors there told me the baby was small , but never said where she was on the scale of how babies should be			1
' at first , mrs @entity11 's doctors and midwife were not overly worried , and suggested that a better diet and some treatment after birth might be enough to boost the baby 's weight			1
' we were under the impression it was malnutrition , because the placenta was n't working well , ' she said			0
' one week it would be fine , the next week not			1
i thought i needed to eat more , and steroids after birth would help her along			0
' i was told she might need postnatal care when she was born to plump her up			0
' but when @entity1 was born , doctors were unprepared for what they would find			1
' the doctors were expecting skin and bones , mrs @entity11 says			1
' but she was extremely small , but chubby			0
it was not what they were prepared for at all			0
' the family are incredibly close , and the girls , who go to the same school , say they get on very well for five hours mrs @entity11 and her husband were unable to see @entity1 , who was immediately taken away by doctors for tests			1
feeding was difficult , and mrs @entity11 was unable to breastfeed her daughter as the little girl had to be tube - fed. ' everything that went down , even by tube , would come back up , ' she says			1
' her dad was the rock			0
he took it all in his stride , ' she says			0
' i was all over the place			0
we had n't experienced anything like this before			0
you are in quite a lot of shock			0
' the doctors are n't giving you any answers			2
' they did n't even know themselves until recently			0
' mrs @entity11 said @entity1 - who was a ' diva ' at nursery , loves going to school and is very happy there @entity1 spent one entire year in hospital before she was allowed to come home for the first time			1
' she had a year of hospitalisation , she had x-rays , blood tests - but no one had any clue as to why she is the way she is			2
but it was when she came home after her first birthday that the family realised that although their little girl was tiny , she must not be underestimated			2
' she had this extraordinary fighting spirit			0
' she went on to shock the doctors			2
her father wanted her to be fed properly - not to be fed with a tube any more			2
' i was not handling it well for the first two years , but he kept pushing			2
' he wanted to know , " what 's wrong with her throat ? is there anything actually wrong ? " ' when the doctors told him no , he said , " bring me a jar of baby food " , and he started feeding her			1
' he helped her sit up , he supported her spine , helped her strengthen her neck			0
' he walked her around the living room , ' she says			0
the family found that when it came to schooling , they had to push for @entity1 to be accepted at a regular school			1
' we were given a thick pile of papers to find her a special school , but there is n't a school for people like her			0
she 's small , but her brains are quite advanced			2
' she has remarkable spirit , and we wanted her to go to a regular school - but we had to push for it			2
mrs @entity11 revealed she had to stay up until 2am the night before @entity1 's first day , making her a small school uniform after struggling to find support from the school suppliers who she says said they would help but did n't			1
' the school said she should just come in her normal clothes , but we did n't want that			0
i wanted to make it as normal as possible for her			0
primordial dwarfism is a very rare form of dwarfism that results in a smaller body size in all stages of life beginning from before birth			1
it is in the profoundly proportionate category of dwarfism , meaning that individuals are extremely small for their age even as a foetus			2
the condition frequently remains undiagnosed until between three and five years of age			1
' she 's different enough already , why make her stand out more ? now @entity1 has settled in and is loving school , mrs @entity11 says			1
' at nursery she was the diva , but school has tamed her , ' she adds			0
after five years of not knowing what condition @entity1 had , the little girl was finally diagnosed last week			1
' in august , doctors said they may have found something , but they were n't 100 per cent sure			2
' then last week , we got the final conformation that it is a type of primordial dwarfism			1
it is very , very rare - only four known families are affected by it			1
' has it helped to know ? you 're relieved to know there is a name for it , ' she says			0
' you 're researching everything , coming across things			0
the doctors said it could be something even they do n't know about			2
' ' to know there are at least three other people with it , that we can find out what her life might be like , that really helps			0
