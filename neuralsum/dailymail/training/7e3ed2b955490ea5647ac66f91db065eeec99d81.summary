the unseasonably good weather has been rather fortunate for me this week because i had to strip down to my waist for a revealing photo shoot outdoors			2
it was to put the final touches to my 2015 calendar – my agent said it was a good idea to do one – i ’m not entirely sure that people will want to see my face beaming out at them all through 2015 but it ’s been done now anyway , so i ’ll let you be the judge			1
you can have a sneak preview at signaturecalendars.co.uk and they can be pre-ordered now			2
you may have noticed that i ’m looking decidedly pale at the moment , my @entity35 tan has long since faded and the one saving grace is that i ’m in pretty good nick			0
this is remarkable because i ’m currently going to about seven nightclub @entity41 a week – @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 in the past five days			0
i ’m trying to keep the drinking down to a minimum ( i 'm only having @entity49 – vodka , fresh lime and soda ) and trying to stick to four workouts a week , and popping three @entity54 a day to keep the metabolism burning fat			0
@entity19 was thankful for the uncharacteristically good whether as he shot the images on the roof of a @entity30 warehouse an on - shoot assistant oils up @entity19 's newly toned physique @entity61 : @entity19 nails the moody look as he gets snapped for his shoot the @entity65 have been a big help and body fat is down to around 11 per cent and weight is around 13st , not quite @entity70 cover material but only a couple of weeks of hard work and dedication away from that			1
the problem is that now the @entity76 parties have started in earnest and with @entity78 on the horizon ( only 13 ½ weeks away ) there is going to be plenty of temptation to keep me off the straight and narrow			0
one thing that might help me stay virtuous was that had to spend a gruelling four hours personally signing all the front covers of my 2015 calendar			1
i ’ve now got a serious case of @entity90 and so for the next few days at least i can barely raise a glass with my right hand			0
and you can see a video of me signing calendars below			0
lots of love , @entity19			1
xxx getting down to business : @entity19 poses mid push - up loves his fans : @entity19 makes time to sign a few calendars between shooting			1

@entity19 has been putting together the final touches for his 2015 calendar
he has taken to a @entity30 roof top for his final shoot
going *topless* @entity19 was *doused* in baby oil
it gave the @entity114 boy a chance to show off his new physique
