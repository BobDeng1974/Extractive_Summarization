with soft , fluffy manes , soulful eyes and tiny size , they look like something out of a fairy tale - and are cute enough to brighten anyone 's day			1
but these adorable miniature horses had one mission : to put a smile on the faces of sick children at @entity13 's @entity12			1
mystery and @entity16 trotted into the hospital 's pediatric unit last month to the delight of wide - eyed youngsters , some hooked up to iv poles , who stepped out into the corridors for a closer look			1
and those too sick to leave their beds were n't left out when the long - lashed little creatures came over for a spot of bedside nuzzling			2
cute : @entity31 , 17 , spends time with mini-horse mystery , who visited the pediatric unit at @entity12 in @entity13 playtime : patients @entity37 , left , and @entity38 , right , pet @entity16 from @entity40 in @entity41 the horses are about the size big dogs , and their roles involve offering comfort care and distraction therapy for patients			1
the role is often taken on by dogs in health - care settings , but mini-horses add an extra element of delight as many children do n't know they exist outside of fairy tales			1
animal therapy , according to studies and anecdotal reports , may benefit health , perhaps even speeding healing and recovery			1
stroking @entity32 's nose from her propped - up hospital bed , 14 - year - old @entity63 said : ' i want one			2
' and epilepsy patient @entity31 , 17 , after gently tracing @entity16 's heart - shaped muzzle with her fingers , added : ' they 're so nice and they do n't judge and they 're so sweet			1
' these two horses belong to animal - assisted therapy group @entity40 in @entity41 , based in @entity74 in the @entity75 , northeast of @entity13			2
they have visited nursing homes and centers for the disabled , but this visit was their first ever inside a hospital			0
it was also the first horse - therapy visit for the hospital , and more are planned			2
trotting in : mane in @entity41 staff and volunteers escort animal therapist mystery into the hospital @entity88 : @entity37 , left , and @entity89 , center , pet @entity16 , who is about the size of a big dog fairy tale : ' they 're so nice and they do n't judge and they 're so sweet , ' said epilepsy patient @entity31 @entity98 , the hospital 's director of child life services , said : ' we have long had animal - assisted therapy here at @entity12 and just seen the enormous benefits that animals can have on most children — just the joy that they bring , the unconditional love			1
' he added mini-horses ' are something that most people whether kids or adults have never seen before , and so that builds in a little more excitement and anticipation			0
' they almost look like mythical animals , like they should have wings on , ' she added			0
the horses were ' a smashing success			0
we 're looking forward to having them visit monthly			0
' some people confuse these horses with better - known @entity127 ponies , but minis are less stout , with a more horse - like build			0
mane in @entity41 's owner , @entity131 , a former obstetrics nurse , says the minis bring ' smiles , joy , love and laughter and that 's the true healing in action			0
' some research has suggested that animal - assisted therapy may reduce pain and blood pressure , and decrease fear and stress in hospitalized children			1
but much of it is based on patients ' reports			0
a review of 10 years of studies about in - patient therapy using dogs , published in april in the @entity154 's journal , concluded that it 's safe and can be effective			1
@entity156 : mane in @entity41 's owner , @entity131 says the minis bring ' smiles , joy , love and laughter and that 's the true healing in action ' accident : horse helpers carry hand sanitizer and pooper scoopers in case of accidents on therapy visits dr. @entity171 of @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174 , a co-author of the review , owns seven dogs , four regular horses and a donkey , and strongly supports animal - assisted therapy			1
she acknowledged that skeptics dismiss it as ' touchy - feely ' and lacking hard evidence of any meaningful medical benefits			0
dr @entity185 said studies are needed on whether animals in hospitals can shorten patients ' stays and reduce readmission rates — something her hospital is looking into with dogs and heart failure patients			2
while some worry about animals bringing germs into hospitals , @entity185 's review found no associated infections in patients			0
guidelines from the federal @entity204 note that animal - assisted therapy in health - care settings stems from evidence that having pets at home helps some patients recover more quickly from medical procedures			1
the guidelines focus mostly on infection control procedures and hand - washing for patients and hospital staff			2
ms @entity131 , @entity40 in @entity41 's owner , and her horse helpers carry lots of hand sanitizer and a pooper scooper on therapy visits			0
she does n't feed the horses beforehand , to help avoid accidents			0
even so , one of the horses pooped in a hallway during the @entity13 hospital visit , but the volunteers cleaned up in a flash and no one seemed phased .			0

mystery and @entity16 visited patients at @entity12
animal therapy may benefit health and speed up recovery , say studies
the comforting role is often taken on by dogs in health - care settings
