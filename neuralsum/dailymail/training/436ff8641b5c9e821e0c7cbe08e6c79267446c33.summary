by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 31 july 2013 @entity3 ' halls of the dead ' pre-dating @entity5 are being heralded by archaeologists as the first monuments of their kind to be found in the @entity9			1
the two earth long barrows were uncovered on top of @entity12 in @entity13 and are thought to date to about @entity16 , almost 1,000 years before the famous stone circle in @entity15 was built , according to professor @entity17 , of the @entity18			1
archaeologists who have spent a month excavating the mounds say they have removed fine examples of flint weapons and tools , thought to have been buried in the barrows when first created or later left as offerings to the dead			1
a flaked flint knife ( pictured ) was found in a cremation pit dug into the side of one of the two long barrows as the remains of two large 6000 - year - old halls , each buried within a prehistoric burial mound , have been discovered in @entity13 professor @entity17 said the site was the only one of its type in the @entity9 where ' the halls of the living became the halls of the dead ' , with the long communal halls first ' ritually ' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows			1
he said : ' with this phenomenon of deliberately burning down buildings , tending the fire over a period of days , the argument is that you burn these down when the head of the family dies			1
' here , no new house has been built , but instead they have shovelled up the remains into these barrows and enclosed them with turf			0
he added : ' it 's a very important site			0
' among the finds are two stone axe - heads , a flint hand knife and an arrowhead , with some of the raw materials used in their construction pointing to origins hundreds of miles away from where they were found , according to the dig team			1
an artist 's impression of the @entity73 long hall			0
two earth long barrows were uncovered that archeologists believe date to about @entity16 , almost 1,000 years before @entity5 was built the barrows themselves date to the early @entity73 period when the ancient @entity9 were starting to settle into small communities			2
in one possible clue to the violence of the period , a broken flint arrowhead was discovered in a stone burial chamber uncovered off the side of one of the barrows - although the human remains of the arrow 's possible victim which would have lain within the cairn have long since disappeared due to the acidity of the soil , professor @entity17 said			1
archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings , with the intense heat of the fire carbonising the wood 's form even , including the joints and post holes			2
the barrows measure 30 metres and 70 metres in length , with a single main burial chamber at each end			0
although made originally of earth , at a later date they were covered in stone like cairns found in the @entity115 of @entity116 , professor @entity17 said			1
investigation trenches dug at the site on top of @entity12 in @entity13			1
professor @entity17 said the site was the only one of its type in the @entity9 where ' the halls of the living became the halls of the dead , ' with the long communal halls first ' ritually ' burned and then covered over with soil and turf to form the large barrows the smaller of the barrows has the remains of holes , thought to have contained two metre - wide upright oak posts between which was supported a trough lined with planks upon which the human remains would be placed			1
the dig has been carried out by a team from the @entity18 university , the university of @entity140 and @entity141 , who will return to the site to continue work next year			2
dr @entity144 , @entity13 county archaeologist and dig co-director , said : ' in the @entity9 context , the @entity147 find is unique and unprecedented			2
' professor @entity17 said they had uncovered a picture of a ' monument that keeps changing ' with the needs of the people living around it at the time			0
he added : ' this is a special place with significance as new bodies and new offerings are deposited here			0
' hundreds of years after the first burial , there are very fine flint objects being left here			0
professor @entity17 professor of archaeology at the @entity18 ( pictured ) described the site as ' a very important find '			1
archaeologists have also been excited by the level of preservation in the timber construction of the original hall buildings ' it 's a very important site , firstly because for the first time we have the fabric of an early @entity73 hall being incorporated into the building of a funerary monument			2
' also , because of the preservation of the remains of the structure including evidence of carpentry , we are going to be able to say rather more about the character of these early @entity73 buildings			0
' dr @entity144 said the fact more burial chambers and artefacts had been left at the site hundreds of years after it was first created showed its national importance			0
' these subsequent finds show that 1,000 years after the hall burial mounds were made , the site is still important to later generations living 200 miles away - a vast distance in @entity73 terms , ' he said			0
' for example , the axe and knife may not have been traded , but placed there as part of a ceremony or an ancestral pilgrimage from what is now @entity205			0
' so we witness an inter-connected community linking @entity13 and @entity205 by marriage and by descent 5,000 years ago			0

@entity18 archaeologists have found communal halls that were first ' ritually ' burned and then covered over with soil to form large barrows
the buildings were burned down when the head of the family died
the structures were discovered on top of @entity12 in @entity13 and are thought to date to about @entity222
archeologists have found two stone axe - heads , a flint hand knife and an arrowhead and have described the discovery as a ' very important find '
