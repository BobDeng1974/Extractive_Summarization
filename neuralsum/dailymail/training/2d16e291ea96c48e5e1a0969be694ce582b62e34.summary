@entity0 has reportedly agreed to censor cartoons of @entity2 just two weeks after its founder defended the right to free speech in the wake of the @entity8 terror attacks			1
the social network made the decision after @entity12 authorities threatened to block the site entirely if it did not remove the images - some of which come from @entity8 magazine			1
the dramatic about - face will be personally embarrassing for @entity19 , coming weeks after he defiantly said : ' [ @entity0 ] will never let one country or group dictate what people can share			1
' facebook pages which ' insult ' the @entity2 have been blocked in @entity12 following a court order , leading to founder @entity19 being blasted online in a post dated january 8 , while @entity29 and @entity30 were still on the run having shot 12 people dead in @entity33 , he wrote : ' a few years ago , an extremist in @entity35 fought to have me sentenced to death because @entity0 refused to ban content about @entity2 that offended him			1
' we stood up for this because different voices -- even if they 're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place			0
' @entity0 has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas			2
' we follow the laws in each country , but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world			0
' yet as i reflect on yesterday 's attack and my own experience with extremism , this is what we all need to reject -- a group of extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world			0
' i wo n't let that happen on @entity0			2
i 'm committed to building a service where you can speak freely without fear of violence			0
' my thoughts are with the victims , their families , the people of @entity80 and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas , even when that takes courage			0
' according to the @entity85 , @entity0 has now blocked pages ' that offended the @entity2 ' after getting an order from a court in @entity89 , @entity12 's capital			1
the exact number of pages is unknown , but some of the images on those pages come directly from the pages of @entity8 - the very images @entity19 was defending			1
@entity0 's founder was branded ' a first rate coward ' , a ' sorry excuse for a human ' , and ' a liberal coward ' by users after news of the decision became public			2
the dramatic about - face comes just weeks after @entity19 posted an impassioned defence of free speech , saying that @entity0 will ' never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share ' it is not the first time the website has been accused of double - standards by censoring content on behalf of dictatorial regimes while claiming to stand up for freedom of speech			1
in december last year , the site removed a @entity122 page linked to @entity123 , a well - known critic of @entity124 , after requests from internet regulators			0
@entity0 has also been accused of censoring dissident groups in @entity128 and @entity129 , as well as campaign groups demanding freedom for @entity132			0
it is also the latest crackdown by the hard - line @entity12 regime on dissenters			1
earlier this month , @entity12 's president began to press for new legislation which would allow ministers to temporarily ban websites , and force @entity142 to block an anonymous whistleblower			2
the proposed law would allow ministers to restrict access to websites deemed to threaten lives , public order or rights and freedoms			0
the @entity152 ( @entity153 ) would have to comply within four hours , and then apply for a court order for the ban to be extended beyond 24 hours			0
@entity12 president @entity156 , pictured , had previously vowed to ' eradicate ' @entity142 after allegations of public corruption were published on the site communications minister @entity160 this week defended the proposal , saying it was needed after @entity12 's top court in october annulled previous legislation giving greater powers to ban websites , and saying it would only be used in emergencies			1
last year @entity12 came under international criticism for temporary bans on @entity0 and @entity142 as a corruption scandal unfolded			2
@entity156 vowed to ' eradicate ' @entity142 after allegations of government corruption were published on the micro-blogging site			0
meanwhile @entity0 was briefly banned in @entity35 along with @entity142 after the sites refused to remove pictures pertaining to be the @entity2			1
@entity0 did eventually bow to pressure and blocked the images in @entity35 .			0

@entity0 will ban pages in @entity12 which ' insult @entity2 '
comes weeks after @entity19 defended right to be offensive in post
@entity12 also banned web access to cover of @entity8 magazine
move is seen as the latest in crackdown on ' offending *religious* material '
