by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 13:56 est , 11 march 2014 a disgusted mother opened a jar of baby food for her eight - month - old son and found it covered in green mould			1
@entity8 , 31 , had stocked up on ten 89p jars of @entity11 baby food at her local @entity13 branch to feed her toddler @entity14			1
but a week later she took the lid off one of the organic @entity16 and was greeted with a patch of mould on the food			2
mrs @entity8 has been offered a refund and an apology by @entity13 and is now sending the rogue jar to the manufacturers to investigate			1
sickened : @entity8 with the mouldy baby food from @entity25 and her toddler @entity14 she said : ' i was nearly sick because of the smell			1
' we go out of our way to spend extra money for organic food and you put your trust in these companies to give you the good nutrients your baby needs			2
' if it was adult food it 's unacceptable but it 's worse because it is baby food			1
' @entity13 can only do so much because you ca n't see it from the outside so i 'm blaming the manufacturers for their quality control because it should not have happened			0
' i want them to accept they have done something wrong and to make sure their quality control is more watertight so it does n't happen again			0
' mrs @entity8 bought the food from a @entity13 near her home in @entity53 , @entity54 , and it was within its sell - by - date			2
grim find : the mouldy baby food from @entity25 ' Â­ s a spokesman for the manufacturers said the jar must have lost its air vacuum and let oxygen get in and form a mould on the food			1
they said : ' at @entity11 we take huge pride in our quality control procedures and therefore take complaints of this nature extremely seriously			0
' @entity69 can only ever grow in the presence of oxygen , which would suggest that this jar had lost vacuum prior to the opening of it			0
' we do believe that @entity11 baby foods are produced to the most rigorous standards within the industry , and after the heat treatment process is completed to preserve the baby food , there is no possibility of mould entering the product unless the jar loses vacuum			1
mrs @entity8 bought the food from a @entity13 near her home in @entity53 , @entity54 , and it was within its sell - by - date ' we have spoken to ms @entity8 who has agreed to send us the sample of the product in question and explained that upon receiving the product we will start a full internal investigation to try and determine why the vacuum seal on this jar has failed and send her a full report of our findings			2
' we can confirm that we have not received any other complaints on this product			0
' @entity13 said : ' we expect all the branded products we sell to meet our high standards and we were concerned to learn of this issue			0
' our @entity102 has asked mrs @entity8 for further details and to return the product so that we can thoroughly investigate with the brand supplier to see what might have happened			0
' we will of course be keeping mrs @entity8 updated with the findings			0

@entity8 was sickened to find green mould *infesting* her child 's food
