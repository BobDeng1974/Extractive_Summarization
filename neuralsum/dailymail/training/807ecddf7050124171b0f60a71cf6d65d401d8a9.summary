by @entity0 the @entity2 film @entity3 prompted 26 complaints to the @entity5 last year a record number of films were given a @entity5 rating last year raising concerns a growing number of children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex			1
in 2012 , 321 films were given this classification , up a third from 234 the previous year			0
the rating means children aged 12 and over can go and see a film at the cinema or watch on dvd unaccompanied , and those under this age can also view the film with an adult			0
the figures come on the same day it emerged @entity2 ’s @entity5 hit @entity3 prompted the most number of complaints to the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) over its ’ violent , dark and sadistic ’ content which was felt to be unsuitable for young children			1
the thriller in which a man shoots dead five people using a sniper rifle and then flees had already been subject to a number of cuts to get it down to the certificate it actually achieved but still generated 26 complaints last year			1
@entity41 , @entity42 were other @entity5 films that also saw the @entity5 receive complaints in 2013 with many parents disapproving of the strong language often included , sexual references in some instances and the graphic content			2
the rise in the number of @entity5 films comes despite a study by the @entity5 , in january , showing 27 per cent of consumers were unable to describe accurately what the rating meant			1
@entity57 , president of the @entity5 , said in yesterday ’s annual report more needed to be done to improve understanding			0
@entity60 , co-founder of the @entity62 campaign group , said she always suspected that when the @entity5 category was introduced it would benefit the film industry far more than parents or children , and the record numbers of @entity69 in 2013 appears to confirm this			2
mrs @entity60 said : ‘ @entity71 are a gift to the industry – allowing a whole extra group of children , the under 12s , to provide a new revenue stream , as long as they are with an adult			0
‘ meanwhile the @entity5 are happy to allow surprisingly explicit violence and sadism in @entity69 , as evidenced by the complaints made about 12a @entity3			1
‘ explicit sex is also an issue , and the @entity5 have actually relaxed controls on bad language in this category			0
‘ the @entity5 need to provide much better protection – our children are far too precious to justify weighting regulation in favour of the industry rather than young people ’s wellbeing			0
’ the movie @entity3 , featuring @entity96 and @entity2 , was rated 12a but was called ' sadistic ' earlier this year the @entity5 said age ratings would be relaxed after claiming parents accept it is ‘ game over ’ when protecting their children from bad language			1
updating its guidance for cinema films and dvds , the @entity5 said from february 24 it would be ‘ more flexible about allowing very strong language at 15 ’			0
the changes also impact on @entity5 films which according to the new rules can now include strong language , such as f * * k may be used regularly if in context and that moderate sex references are permitted			2
as a result there are now concerns more films will be given a @entity5 rating this year and could generate more complaints from parents			1
@entity120 , of campaign group @entity121 , said the findings and changes only highlight how children are being used to turn films into lucrative business ventures			1
she said : ‘ the increase would appear to underline the fact that producers want to get that crucial @entity5 rating because it means children can go and leads to a substantial increase in the potential audience			1
‘ you can sell a lot more lunchboxes and duvet covers linked to the film if under 12s have been allowed to see it			0
‘ the problem arises at the top end of the classification , when producers make a snip here and a cut there to a film so they can get the @entity5 rating			1
it does not always mean the film is suitable for children			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity5 said : ‘ the rise is not down to more strong language being allowed at @entity5			0
‘ the very minor tweak in the @entity156 to take more account of context when classifying strong language at @entity5 only came into use in january this year and is unlikely to result in a sharp rise in films passed @entity5			2
‘ the rise in @entity5 films in 2013 is more likely due to an increase in film submissions generally			2
