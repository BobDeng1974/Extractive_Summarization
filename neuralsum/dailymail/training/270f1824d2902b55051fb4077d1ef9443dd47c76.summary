by @entity0 published : 00:37 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 14:47 est , 5 october 2013 @entity2 's sister @entity1 has long been seen in the kidnapping victim 's shadow , but after her appearance during an hour - long special about the ordeal , it is clear that she is all grown up			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity8 about the night in june 2002 when her sister was taken from the bed they shared and how she tried her best to go unnoticed			1
' if he realizes i 'm awake , maybe he 'll take me as well and then my family will never know what happened to us , ' she recalls thinking to herself			0
all grown up : @entity17 talked about how she heard the man taking her sister @entity19 from the bed they shared when they were children in 2002 then and now : @entity1 was 9 when the kidnapping occurred ( left ) and now she is 20 - years - old ( right ) @entity1 was only 9 - years - old when her then - 14 - year - old sister @entity19 was taken by @entity25			1
now she is all grown up and 20 - years - old , with long blonde hair just like her older sister			2
during the @entity30 interview , which aired friday night , @entity1 and her mother @entity28 told how the beginning of that horrible night was a normal one in the @entity33 household			2
she and her sister shared a bed , and @entity19 was happily playing the big - sister role by reading @entity37 to @entity1			1
she recalled : ' i was begging and crying and just so scared			0
i remember thinking , i know what comes after a wedding			0
and that can not happen to me			0
that can not happen ' bond of sisters : on the night of her kidnapping , @entity19 had stayed up late reading to @entity1 from @entity37 in the middle of the night , a man walked into their room and threatened @entity19 with a knife against her neck			1
' i felt immediately awake			0
i could feel or sense my sister lying in bed next to me , she was asleep			2
i was so scared , ' @entity19 said during the interview			2
@entity1 told @entity8 that she tried to lay as still as possible to make sure that she would not get taken as well , but then still knew she needed to get out of bed eventually to help her sister			1
' i was just trying to work up enough courage to run into my parents room and tell them what happened , ' she said			0
when she went into her parents ' bedroom and raised the alarm - saying simply ' @entity19 's gone ' - it did n't seem real to her parents			1
holding out hope : @entity1 was the one who remembered - four months after @entity19 had been taken - that the captor could have been the man named @entity70 who had done some handiwork around the house ' hearing those words coming from a sound sleep , it 's like " oh , she 's had a bad dream " and when she continued " no , she really is gone , " i got up and went running down the stairs and my first view was at the window and the screen was , i could tell it had been cut , ' @entity28 said			1
not only was @entity1 the one to first alert her parents , but she ended up being the one to provide the pivotal final clue			2
four months after her sister had been taken , @entity1 suddenly realized that she remembered the man who was in their bedroom that night			1
' i was just waiting for my dad to come in to tuck me into bed			0
i was just thinking like maybe who could it possibly be and @entity70 just popped into my head , ' she said			0
critical : @entity1 helped them come up with the sketch that they released , which later helped them identify @entity19 's captor - @entity25 @entity70 was the name that @entity25 had told the @entity100 when they offered to pay him to do some handiwork around the house after @entity28 saw him begging on the street months before the kidnapping			1
with @entity1 's realization , the @entity100 were able to get a sketch of @entity25 and pushed for police to immediately release it			2
officials were hesitant because they were following another lead , but eventually they succumbed and the sketch aired on @entity112			0
a short while later , a woman called in a tip saying that she thought she spotted that man in a @entity117 @entity116			0
she ended up being right , and when @entity25 , his wife @entity119 and a well - covered @entity33 were brought into a police station , the kidnapped teenager was finally reunited with her father .			0

@entity1 shared a bed with @entity19 and was in the room when her sister was kidnapped
the then - 9 - year - old was the one to tell her parents : ' @entity19 's gone '
four months after the kidnapping , she remembered the name of the captor
