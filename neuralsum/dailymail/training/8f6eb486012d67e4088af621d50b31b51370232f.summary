after months of rising tensions over the future of the islands , the prime minister made clear for the first time that @entity5 is prepared to mount a repeat of the 1982 conflict if they are threatened			1
asked if the @entity5 would fight to keep the @entity7 , he replied : ‘ of course we would			1
‘ we have strong defences in place on the @entity7			1
that is absolutely key - we have fast jets stationed there , we have troops stationed on the @entity7			2
‘ i get regular reports on this entire issue because i want to know that our defences are strong , our resolve is extremely strong			2
’ mr @entity2 insisted that despite defence cuts , @entity5 would be able to defend the islands again , as @entity29 did in 1982 at a cost of more than 900 lives - 255 of them @entity5 servicemen			1
‘ at £ 35 billion a year , we still have one of the top five defence budgets in the world ; and we ’ll go on having that scale of defences and we ’re actually re-equipping our armed services in a very , very effective way , ’ he told the @entity4 ’s @entity3 programme			1
a war of words over the future of the @entity7 , known to @entity44 as @entity7 , has erupted since the re-election of @entity46 as the country ’s president			0
the fiery @entity44 leader attempted to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country ’s claim to the @entity5 territory into mr @entity2 ’s hands in an encounter at a recent @entity59 summit			2
to her fury , the prime minister repeatedly refused to accept it , insisting she should respect the views of the islanders who want to remain @entity5			1
@entity65 : mr @entity2 , right , discusses the @entity7 with @entity3 , left , on @entity66 this morning role model : mr @entity2 , right , says that he would be willing to follow in former conservative prime minister @entity29 's ( left ) footsteps and fight for the @entity7 last week , as her popularity at home plummets , she published an open letter to mr @entity2 claiming that @entity44 had been ‘ forcibly stripped ’ of the islands and demanding negotiations over sovereignty			1
srong opinion : @entity44 president @entity46 has been very outspoken about the @entity7 and has demanded negotiations with mr @entity2 the letter was timed to coincide with the 180th anniversary of what @entity44 claims is a @entity5 occupation			1

it has been accused of ‘ intimidating ’ @entity5 cruise ships near the @entity7			2
six incidents have occurred in the past two months where protesters or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted vessels bound for the islands , the @entity91 said			0
they include officials refusing entry to @entity44 ports or delaying ships , masked militants attacking and ransacking shipping company offices and cruise itineraries either altered , or abandoned , to appease locals			0
the @entity7 administration has responded to the tensions by calling a referendum , to be held in march , which is expected to see an overwhelming majority of residents vote in favour of retaining the present status as a @entity5 overseas territory			2
lord @entity117 , the former head of the @entity118 , said mrs @entity46 was behaving in a ‘ very stupid way ’ over the islands , he insisted that he did not think any military action was imminent from @entity44 , despite her sabre - rattling , but warned the situation could escalate			0
' it would be laughable if it was n’t for the fact that these things sometimes lead to really nasty things , ’ @entity117 told @entity129			0
history : steel helmets abandoned by @entity44 armed forces who surrendered at @entity134 to @entity136 troops during the @entity137 ‘ i lost 22 of my boys down there and we do not want through stupidity and this sort of silly nonsense ending up in that position again			0
' at the moment the @entity44 are incapable of and would n’t want to do a military action , but that can change very quickly			0
’ dr @entity147 , of the @entity148 , said : ‘ we are not a colony - our relationship with the @entity5 is by choice			0
‘ unlike the @entity91 , the @entity5 respects the right of our people to determine our own affairs , a right that is enshrined in the @entity156 and which is ignored by @entity44			0
