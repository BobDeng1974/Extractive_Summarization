shadow education spokesman @entity0 is set to attack the ' @entity1 ' between the fee - paying and state education system today the headmaster of @entity0 ’s former school yesterday accused @entity6 ’s education spokesman of ‘ offensive bigotry ’ after he threatened to strip private schools of tax breaks worth £ 700million			1
@entity10 , head of £ 17,835 - a - year @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , said the policy by one of his old boys was ‘ tasteless ’			0
he spoke out after mr @entity0 railed against a ‘ @entity1 ’ between private and state education which had created a ‘ corrosive divide of privilege ’			1
in a speech , mr @entity0 unveiled plans to make private schools forge stronger links with state schools or face losing the tax relief			1
their efforts must include competing with state schools at football and other sports instead of running ‘ exclusive private - only competitions ’ , he said			1
but his plan to put private schools under a legal duty to co-operate with the state system triggered a backlash among head teachers in both sectors			1
critics accused @entity6 of declaring a new class war after failing nearly a decade ago to threaten the charitable status of private schools			1
the party was also accused of ‘ rank hypocrisy ’ as it emerged that one in four members of the @entity48 went to private schools , including mr @entity0 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
mr @entity10 , whose school was attended by mr @entity0 in the late 1980s , said @entity6 was ignoring a wealth of partnerships that already operate between private and state schools			1
he said the party appeared to be attempting to ‘ rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector ’			2
he added : ‘ is n’t it time for @entity6 to come up with some new , helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry ? ’ @entity65 , chairman of the @entity66 , accused mr @entity0 of promoting a ‘ 1980s view of education ’			1
he said : ‘ does dr @entity0 think that when mr @entity70 from the independent school drifts in to teach a bit of history at the local state school because his head has told him to under instruction from dr @entity0 that this is going to transform the relationship between state and private school ? it ’s patronising nonsense			1
’ mr @entity0 attended the fee - paying @entity11 in @entity13 in the 1980s , but came under fire from current headteacher @entity10 the plans also drew criticism from a union representing thousands of head teachers and senior staff in state secondary schools , which warned against setting up ‘ more legislative hoops for schools to jump through ’			1
some 2,570 fee - paying schools can claim an 80 per cent cut in business rates because they are charities , and in 2013 they saved £ 165million in this way			1
but mr @entity0 insisted that many private schools provide only token benefits to their communities , such as entry to art exhibitions for three hours a day or allowing occasional use of a football field			2
under @entity6 ’s blueprint , private schools will be required to pass a partnership test to keep their business rate relief , which is estimated to be worth £ 700million over the course of the next @entity105			2
as well joint sports tournaments , this could include sharing teachers , running courses to help state pupils get into leading universities and sponsoring state academies			0
speaking at a state school in @entity114 , mr @entity0 said the taxpayer was expected to subsidise ‘ the education of a privileged few ’			1
he added : ‘ it baffles me that we can have private schools loaning a sports pitch to the local comprehensive once or twice a year yet completely refusing to play them at football , opening up their halls and amphitheatres yet unwilling to engage in a debating competition			0
’ but critics said tournaments such as the annual @entity131 schools ’ rugby competition were open to state and independent schools			0
private school leaders said 90 per cent of fee - paying schools were ‘ involved in meaningful and effective partnerships with state schools ’			1
mr @entity65 added : ‘ independent schools generate £ 4.7billion in tax and save the taxpayer £ 4billion , equivalent to building 460 schools , by educating children out of the state school sector			1
’ @entity144 , president of the @entity145 , and head of @entity148 grammar school in @entity149 , said partnerships only worked when they were ‘ entered into willingly ’			0
‘ more can be done to encourage schools to work together , but forcing collaboration through regulation will not work , ’ he added			0
mr @entity0 will also say the ' corrosive divide of privilege ' is harming children 's prospects ( file picture , posed ) ‘ in much of the country , state and independent schools have a healthy working relationship			1
’ @entity163 critics said the policy was an attempt to appeal to core voters following the resignation of @entity168 as shadow attorney general over a tweet that was seen as patronising working people			0
@entity172 , a @entity163 member of the @entity173 , said : ‘ this rank hypocrisy from @entity6 is a pathetic attempt to regain some socialist street cred after the resignation of @entity168			2
‘ it wo n’t bother the big public schools the likes of @entity0 , @entity50 and @entity51 went to			2
but it will hurt small independent schools charging more modest fees to aspirational middle - class families			2
@entity184 is reviving class warfare , not social mobility			0
’ but mr @entity0 insisted just 3 per cent of private schools sponsored an academy , while 5 per cent loaned teaching staff to state schools and a third shared facilities			1
‘ the only possible answer to whether they earn their £ 700million subsidy is a resounding and unequivocal “ no ” , ’ he said			0
‘ over the last few years we have seen the limitations of asking private schools politely			0
so the next government will say , “ step up and play your part			0
because the time you could expect something for nothing is over ”			0
’ a spokesman for education secretary @entity206 said : ‘ this government has done more than any other to encourage the state and independent sectors to work more closely together			2
’ @entity0 ’s former school has forged links with three state secondaries and several primaries			2
@entity11 is associated with @entity215 because the heads of each are governors at the other			0
benefits to pupils at @entity215 include help in applying to university , as well as @entity225 lessons and help with maths and @entity227			0
pupils at @entity229 in @entity13 share @entity11 ’s facilities , such as its swimming pool , while the @entity233 benefits from advice and support from senior teachers at @entity11 in subjects such as science and history			0
rugby class : @entity131 star @entity241 with pupils from @entity11 @entity11 headmaster @entity10 said : ‘ if mr @entity0 wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that @entity11 generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that @entity11 receives through its charitable status			1
and @entity11 is not alone in this regard			0
’ the @entity66 said 91.6 per cent of members were involved in partnership activities with the state sector			0
among other shared activities , state schools have been playing rugby against independents for 26 years in the @entity257 , now the @entity258			0
the @entity66 said some independents sponsor state - funded academies while others offer gcse or a-level revision classes , lend teachers or hold university entrance master - classes			0
most schools already share their facilities and are ‘ glad to do so ’ , it said			0
state secondaries involved include @entity6 leader @entity184 ’s old school – @entity270 , in @entity271 , @entity13			2
the physics department at fee - paying girls ’ @entity274 has mentored a-level physics teachers at @entity270 .			1
