sir @entity0 has created his new brand of hotels - the first of which opened this year in @entity5 - keeping the female traveller in mind			1
the entrepreneur has focused on the fairer sex for the @entity10 in @entity5 , with a bench in the shower so women can sit and shave their legs to a ' @entity15 ' in the minibar			1
containing condoms and sex toys , the $ 20 addition is one of the more unusual extras found in the room alongside the reasonably priced snacks ( the hotel prides itself on charging accurate prices for food and drink )			1
the compartment divider can slide across , if people require privacy when ordering room service in order to design a hotel that would appeal to women , @entity36 held focus groups with frequent female travelers asking them what was on their hotel wish lists			2
the responses stated they mainly wanted safety and convenience the 26 - storey , @entity49 building 's rooms have also been designed with a large vanity table complete with drawers to store make - up and even a sliding compartment door with a peep hole separating the entrance and the bedroom , so guests in a state of undress can accept room service without being seen			1
with additional clothes hangers especially for lingerie and an app called @entity65 for calling room service , the hotel certainly appears to favour the females			0
' i do n't think any hotel caters to the female traveller , ' @entity0 , 64 , told the @entity70			0
' it will give @entity36 an edge to make sure we look after them			0

this allows room service to be ordered , and modesty protected the hotel has caused a stir for more than just its unusual mini bar offerings			1
when it was unveiled in january , the hotel also showcased a room key vending machine instead of a check - in desk and even free drinks at happy hour			2
the hospitality group , which includes everything from airplanes to mobile phone plans , has long made eliminating fees and surcharges a top priority			0
so it 's perhaps no surprise that @entity118 is free and room service is available at no additional cost			0
at the heart of the property is the @entity123 , a members - only inspired space where guests can drink , dine and mingle			0
some of the quirky additions at the hotel are designed to make female travellers feel comfortable and offer a sense of ' fun ' it 's here that visitors can also take advantage of @entity134 - like happy hour , but better - where all drinks are free between 6pm and 7pm			1
guests can plug their music into a usb port in the room to stream their own favourite bands , or take advantage of the free music albums on the tv , specially curated for the hotels			0
