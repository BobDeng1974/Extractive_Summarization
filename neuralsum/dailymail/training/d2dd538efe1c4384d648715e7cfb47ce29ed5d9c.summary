by @entity0 gangs have been stripping away @entity3 headlights from luxury @entity4 and using them to grow cannabis in the latest car crime trend			1

stolen : the front headlights and grill of this @entity4 , owned by @entity24 , were among those taken by thieves in @entity27 , @entity28 one theory is that the powerful headlights - costing around £ 1,000 each - are being stolen to be used in cannabis production			1
@entity24 , 53 , licensee of the @entity33 in @entity34 , had the lights and front grille stolen from his @entity37 outside his pub in @entity27 , @entity28 , on april 16			1
he said the crooks caused £ 8,000 in damage to his vehicle			0
' it is rife , ' he said			0
' but it is such an easy crime - it is so fast			0
it took them about ten minutes maximum			0
they put a crowbar in between the front wing and the headlights			2
' they wrecked the wing			0
they know how to disable the alarm on the cars			2
' mr @entity24 said he knew of at least 40 other @entity4 in the area that had been targeted in similar thefts			2
probe : this @entity60 image shows a van which was allegedly used in the theft from mr @entity24 's car ' the rumour circulating among other victims is that the headlights are being used to cultivate cannabis			1
' i ’m not sure how it would work , presumably because they are quite strong			0
' ' but it could be more simple in that they ’re stealing them to order so they can put them on other vehicles			0
' he added : ' i 've heard the lights are being shipped abroad , then sold on @entity79 to come back over here			0
' he has now fitted his own security measures to his car to prevent similar thefts in future			0

she said : ' i am frustrated because i feel like @entity20 should be recalling vehicles			1
it is so easy to get the grille and the lights out - that is a design fault			0
' @entity28 police chief inspector @entity115 said one of the other motives of the gangs was to use the parts to fit to other vehicles			1
' @entity122 is taking this issue very seriously and recently launched @entity15 specifically to target the theft of 4x4 vehicle parts , ' she said			0
