passengers were left terrified after a plane lost one of its propellers in a bird strike but continued with the rest of the hour - long flight on just one engine			1
the @entity9 service had just taken off from @entity10 for @entity11 when startled travellers heard a loud bang on the left side of the aircraft			1
they looked out and saw the front cone of the prop had been smashed and the remains of a bird could be seen on the jagged edge			2
scroll for video smashed : the @entity9 plane 's propeller was smashed in a bird strike after take off but to their alarm , the captain announced that instead of turning round , the 78 - seat @entity28 would carry on with the single remaining engine			1
airport worker @entity30 , 23 , travelling with his girlfriend @entity31 , 25 , said he was shocked the crew did n't declare an emergency and land			1
@entity30 , an aircraft despatcher from @entity10 , who also filmed the incident on his mobile phone , said : ' it is very unusual for an engine to shut down			1
' it 's not unheard of - i have heard stories about it - but i have never seen an aircraft sustain that amount of damage to it and carry on			1
@entity30 and @entity31 were on board the flight and reported hearing a ' loud bang ' ' usually planes will land with a problem over the smallest of things , so it just seemed so unusual			1
' when that bit of the prop came off , it could have very easily gone into the engine , and that would be the engine on fire			2
' it could have hit the elevator - that 's the bit that pitches the aircraft to climb or descend - if you do n't have that , the plane crashes			2
' of course , there is nothing that anyone could do about hitting a bird , but i was just more concerned they carried on regardless			0
' they took quite a while to shut the engine down - maybe 20 minutes into the flight - and then to carry on flying for the rest of the flight with just one engine			1
' if something happened to that one engine , the plane would have just dropped out of the sky			1
an airport worker inspects the damage to the @entity9 plane after it landed in @entity11 ' they would have had to put the remaining engine on max thrust and it is not supposed to be at full speed for the whole flight			1
' it was very unusual for them to carry on			0
i can only assume it was a case of the pilots wanted to be at home in @entity11 for the night			0
' @entity30 and @entity31 were travelling to a family party on the 10.30am flight last saturday when the drama happened			1
they heard a ' loud bang ' shortly after take - off and a cabin assistant reported the damage to the flightdeck			1
@entity30 said : ' she went and reported it back to the flight crew on the phone at the front of the cabin , and i got my phone out and started filming the prop through the window			2
' i could see a bird 's claw was hanging off the prop			0
' shortly after one of the pilots came back and had a look out and then returned to the cockpit			0
full emergency : @entity30 , who was on board the flight , said there were eight fire engines and four operational vehicles waiting for the @entity9 plane at @entity11 airport ' there was a @entity133 announcement from the first officer i think saying that as a precaution they were going to shut the engine down as it was wobbling a lot			1
' the aircraft was also vibrating more than normal , but they said they were going to continue all the way to @entity11			0
' i immediately thought that was unusual			0
there had been talk of diverting to @entity146			0
' when we got too @entity11 they had declared a full emergency			0
there was eight fire engines and i think four operational vehicles			0
' @entity30 claimed that he and another passenger were warned not to photograph the damage when they exited the plane			1
he added : ' the cheek of it			0
we 'd just had to sit on that plane			0
' the incident was reported to the @entity162 who record all ' birdstrikes '			0
a @entity162 spokesman said : ' we have received a @entity166 ( @entity166 ) from @entity9 relating to a birdstrike , which occurred during a flight on november 8th			2
' the aircraft landed safely at @entity170 , with no injury to any passengers or crew			0
' captain @entity174 , @entity9 's director of flight operations and @entity176 , said : ' @entity9 can confirm that flight @entity178 from @entity10 to @entity11 experienced a bird strike during saturday 's flight			1
' the aircraft continued it journey safely to @entity170 and was met by emergency services as a routine and precautionary measure only			0
' once at its stand all passengers disembarked normally			0
