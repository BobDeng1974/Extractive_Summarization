researchers have found an entirely new type of ' good ' fat made in the body could help prevent and treat diabetes			1
the previously unidentified lipid molecules that increase insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control could be the latest weapon to tackle the type 2 diabetes epidemic			2
unlike omega - 3 fatty acids found in oily fish which are not made in mammals , the good fat named fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids , or @entity12 , are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body			1
the protein @entity21 which moves to the cell surface to help transport glucose from the blood into the cell after a meal			0
in 2012 , 29.1 million @entity34 , or 9.3 % of the population , had diabetes			0
of the 29.1 million , 21.0 million were diagnosed , and 8.1 million were undiagnosed			0
diabetes remains the 7th leading cause of death in the @entity34 in 2010 the @entity40 estimates in @entity41 there are approximately 3.1 million people over 16 with diabetes but by 2030 the figure is expected to rise to 4.6 million , with nine out of ten sufferers having type 2 diabetes			2
type 1 diabetes ( formerly called juvenile - onset or insulin - dependent diabetes ) , accounts for 5 to 10 out of 100 people who have diabetes			0
in type 1 diabetes , the body 's immune system destroys the cells that release , eventually eliminating insulin production from the body			1
' we were blown away to discover this completely new class of molecules , ' professor @entity59 of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) said			0
professor @entity64 of @entity65 said : ' based on their biology , we can add @entity12 to the small list of beneficial lipids			2
' these lipids are amazing because they can also reduce inflammation , suggesting that we might discover opportunities for these molecules in inflammatory diseases , such as @entity75 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis , as well as diabetes			0
' the new findings , made by a team of scientists from and the @entity65 , was published online in the journal @entity82			0
they now join a small group of fatty acids known to benefit health , which also include omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish oil			1
fahfas are actually produced and broken down inside the human body and prof @entity59 said ' this important feature gives @entity12 an advantage in terms of therapeutic development because we can potentially modify the rate of production and breakdown throughout the body			2
' because we can measure @entity12 levels in blood , low levels may turn out to be an early marker for the risk of developing type 2 diabetes			1
' consequently , if restoring @entity12 levels in insulin resistant individuals proves to be therapeutic , we may potentially be able to intervene before the development of frank diabetes			2
' the discovery was made using mice have with elevated fatty acids , a sign of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance			1
the study use mass spectrometry to study the fat molecules they discovered four groups that were elevated 16 - 18-fold in the insulin resistant mice , but not in the normal mice			2
further tests revealed that feeding the mice extra @entity125 resulted in a rapid and dramatic drop in blood sugar and rise in insulin			0
they also looked at @entity12 levels in human fat and plasma from people who were insulin resistant and at high risk for developing diabetes			1
the @entity12 levels were found to be 50 to 75 per cent lower than levels in people with normal insulin sensitivity , suggesting that changes in @entity12 levels might be contributing to diabetes			1
the team also identified @entity143 , the cellular receptor that fahfas bind to			0
prof @entity59 said : ' when @entity12 bind to @entity143 , they are able to control how much glucose is taken up into fat cells			1
unlike omega - 3 fatty acids found in oily fish , the good fat named fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids , or @entity12 , are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body			1
they now join a small group of fatty acids known to benefit health , which also include omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish oil			1
' the receptor may also be responsible for the effects of the novel lipids to reduce widespread macrophage activation , which is associated with obesity and with inflammatory diseases			0
' the discovery of @entity12 provides important new insights underlying metabolic and inflammatory diseases , and , of critical importance , offers viable new treatment avenues that we hope to be able to test in clinical trials			0
' this is of critical importance as rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes remain at epidemic proportions worldwide			0

fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids , or @entity12 , are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body
could be used to spot signs of diabetes early - and treat sufferers
