investigators for a @entity2 committee learned yesterday that @entity5 official @entity4 's hard drive was merely ' scratched ' and data was not ' unrecoverable , ' as previously claimed by the @entity5			1
the @entity7 also said it is now uncertain as to whether @entity4 's hard drive was actually recycled , per previous @entity5 testimony , or ' shredded ' as a court filing states , after reviewing the agency 's it logs , which list the hard drive at one point as having been ' recovered			1
' ' it is unbelievable that we can not get a simple , straight answer from the @entity5 about this hard drive , ' @entity7 chairman @entity16 said in a statement on tuesday			1
in the course of its probe into the @entity5 ' targeting of conservative organizations , the committee says , it also ascertained that it employees who worked on @entity4 's hard drive recommended that it be reviewed by outside experts but the government agency declined to take their advice			1
if the @entity5 had sought outside counsel , it would have likely realized that the data from @entity4 's damaged hard drive was most likely recoverable , the committee said on tuesday after speaking to numerous law enforcement and @entity49 forensic experts			1
the new information ' raises more questions about potential criminal wrong doing at the @entity5 , ' @entity16 said			2
' if the @entity5 would just come clean and tell @entity54 and the @entity56 people what really happened , we could put an end to this , ' he argued			2
' our investigators will not stop until we find the full truth			0
' @entity7 is not the only congressional committee investigating the @entity5 for targeting conservative groups			2
a separate investigation being conducted by the @entity64 is looking into the @entity5 ' failure to inform @entity54 in a timely manner that @entity4 's hard drive had crashed			1
in interviewing @entity69 , the @entity5 deputy associate chief counsel for procedure and @entity71 , last week , the committee determined that the @entity5 knowingly kept the crash from @entity54 for four months			1
in partial testimony from @entity69 released on monday , the @entity5 employee says that the agency knew in early to mid february about the hard drive crash			1
yet , the @entity5 did not tell @entity54 about the crash until june , @entity77 investigating the matter say			1
in a letter to the @entity88 on tuesday , @entity82 chairman @entity81 and @entity83 on @entity84 , job creation , and regulatory affairs chairman @entity80 , both @entity77 , asked the department to appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate why @entity5 commissioner @entity91 hid the information from @entity54 for so long			2
' until we know all the facts , ' @entity80 said at a hearing on the matter this morning , ' the committee will continue to press for the truth			0
' at the hearing @entity91 said that while mr. @entity69 may have knew about @entity4 's hard drive crash in february , but he did not know at that time			1
when he did find out in april , @entity91 said he did not immediately tell @entity54 because he was waiting to find out if the @entity5 had backup tapes of @entity4 's lost emails			1
' my theory is this , you guys were never going to tell us until we caught you , ' @entity80 shouted at him , claiming that the only reason the @entity5 came clean was because of a @entity110 request filed by conservative organization @entity111			2
' it seems to me that before you 're going to make that sort of a charging claim , ' @entity91 fired back , ' you 'd better have evidence			0
' welcome back : today 's hearing marked the third time in the last month that @entity5 chief @entity91 , right , was carted before the @entity64 , led by rep. @entity81 , right @entity91 said he had no idea what was going on with the back up tapes of @entity4 's emails at this juncture because the @entity5 inspector general has taken over the internal investigation into the matter and has asked that he not interfere			1
' at this point i have no information whether there 's anything usable on those tapes , ' @entity91 said			2
asked later by rep. @entity132 about a june 13 memo he sent to two senators in which he ' confirmed that back - up tapes from 2011 no longer exist because they have been recycled ' and if he was still ' confirmed ' , @entity91 said : ' at this point i have no basis for not being confirmed			0
' at this point i know the @entity137 is looking and has n't found anything , ' he said			0
he also argued during the hearing it was not odd that @entity4 and other targets of the congressional investigation had hard drive crashes , as 300 @entity5 employees experienced hard drive crashes during the time period in question			1
today marked the fourth time this year @entity91 had been hauled before the @entity82 committee to discuss the missing emails , and the third time in the last month			0
the @entity5 chief said today that his agency had spent roughly $ 18 million and between 100,000 and 120,000 hours responding to investigations into this matter			2
at one time or another , some 250 employees have been involved in the investigation , he said , it has become a ' significant distraction			0
' the complaint was the subject of a letter from oversight ranking member rep. @entity162 , a @entity163 , to @entity81 on monday			0
' requiring commissioner @entity91 to testify again this week not only takes him away from the day - to - day duties of operating an agency with 90,000 employees , but it also diverts our @entity7 from conducting responsible oversight on many key areas that traditionally have been part of our jurisdiction , ' @entity162 said			0
@entity162 and the ranking member on the oversight subcommittee used their opening statements at today hearing to denigrate @entity77 leading the hearings in @entity82 as well as @entity7 for engaging in a ' taxpayer - funded foot race ' to make headlines on @entity4 's hard drive and slowing down the investigative process by not working together			1
' so its ' something like a children 's fairy tale , that were looking at , ' rep. @entity184 said			0
and it is not a proper way to run an investigation or spend millions in taxpayer funds , ' @entity162 said			0
@entity81 , chairman of the @entity82 committee , responded to @entity162 ' comments by asking that he withdraw statements that ' disparage ' him from his opening statement			0
the committee 's investigation ' should not lead to personal attacks , ' he said			0
it is the responsibility of the committee to provide ' vigorous oversight , ' @entity81 added			0
in a statement yesterday , @entity205 blamed the @entity7 's ongoing probe on the @entity5 ' failure to provide all of the relevant information in a timely manner			2
' it is these constant delays and late revelations that have forced this investigation to go on so long , ' @entity16 said .			0

interviews with it employees of the @entity5 revealed that the @entity5 ignored recommendations to have hard drive sent to outside experts for processing
experts who spoke with congressional investigators say the data likely could have been recovered if @entity4 's hard drive was merely scratched
investigators also found out that @entity4 's hard drive may have been recovered , but it employees said they were n't sure if that was true
the @entity5 did not tell @entity54 about the hard drive crash until june despite knowing since february , new testimony from an @entity5 official shows
the @entity5 chief says he did n't know before april and waited to tell @entity54 until he was sure the emails could not be recovered from backup tapes
