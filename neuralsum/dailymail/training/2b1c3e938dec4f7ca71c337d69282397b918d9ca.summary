police officers have access to to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies at the headquarters of every police force in @entity6 is a small office called the ' @entity8 ' ( @entity8 )			1
there , police officers can log in directly to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies – @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 – as well as @entity14 and internet service providers			1
@entity13 comprises the former networks @entity16 and @entity18 , whose police interface was called @entity21 – an acronym for @entity23			1
armed with the required usernames and passwords , in a few keystrokes the officers can retrieve confidential data from anyone 's telephone or computer use within minutes			1
such swift access can save lives by finding an armed criminal on the run , or help track a terrorist before he strikes – but critics believe the ease with which police can access such information has led them to do so far more often than they should			1
all it takes is a couple of senior officers within the force to sign off the request and any officer can have those details on his screen			0
in theory , a safeguard system should stop spurious or illegal requests , but with more than 2,000 applications for data access under @entity55 being processed each week across the @entity6 , some wonder how effective that oversight can be			2
when @entity58 initially set up @entity55 in 2000 , it decreed that an investigating officer should first approach a ' spoc ' ( or @entity60 ) colleague , who is independent of the investigation and trained to weigh up the request for ' necessity and proportionality '			0
if the @entity60 considers it a valid request , he will take it to a designated senior officer , usually of superintendent rank or above , to be authorised			0
the data is handed back through the spoc by the @entity8 before being passed to the original officer			0
telecoms security expert @entity73 , of @entity75 , said : ' it 's going on every hour of every day			0
as long as the police have the authorisation for the data , the door is always open for them			2
' but he added : ' quick access to communication data can be a matter of life or death if , for example , you 're trying to trace a child carrying a mobile phone			2
' home secretary @entity92 is expected to push through a new law stripping police of the power to secretly spy on journalists ' phones			0

every police force @entity99 has access to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 mainframes
there they can retrieve confidential data from any number within minutes
