‘ family holidays are really important to us			0
we ’ll be taking the girls to @entity80 in @entity81 over @entity82 which will be wonderful			0

‘ allowing people to put more into an account and giving them flexibility to move their money in and out of the stockmarket is a huge boost			2

to further boost their popularity the @entity32 announced that peer - to - peer lending – through so - called lend - to - save websites – would also be allowed to be held in an @entity14 with these sites a saver effectively lends out their cash directly to borrowers , cutting out the bank in the middle			0
and in one final helping hand that will help around 1.5million savers the chancellor also declared that those on small income should no longer have to pay tax on the first £ 5,000 of savings interest they make – effectively handing them a £ 1,000 tax break			1
around 189,000 will be taken out of paying any tax altogether			0
