a small fragment of ancient pottery researchers believe shows the first wine label could prove that the reigns of @entity5 and @entity6 actually occurred			1
the 10th century @entity7 ' @entity8 ' was unearthed last year , and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug			0
a new translation reveals the contents of a jar was ' lousy ' plonk intended for slaves - and sheds new light on society at the time			2
it included 36 gold coins dating back to the seventh century with images of @entity44 emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a @entity47 , @entity46 made from a @entity49 's horn and a @entity51 scroll			0
a 3,000 - year - old earthenware jug was found - which is the same one that has now been deciphered			0
the discovery was made in the ruins of a @entity44 public structure located in the @entity57 - between the city of @entity6 and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the @entity60			2
@entity27 is considered one of the most religious sites in @entity26 and is where two biblical @entity64 temples once stood			1
it is also a site of @entity69 interest site known as the @entity70 as - @entity71 , or @entity27			0
this area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in @entity26 dating back to the 10th century @entity7 , possibly built by @entity5			1
the label is thought to be the most ancient @entity35 engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in @entity26 to date			1
' we are dealing here with real kings , and the kingdom of @entity6 and @entity5 was a real fact , ' @entity36 from the department of @entity79 at @entity80 told @entity86			1
some experts previously claimed it was written in an ancient near @entity90 language , but @entity36 believes it is actually a form of ancient @entity35			1
the inscription is eight letters long and was engraved on a large clay pitcher in the second half of the 10th century @entity7 in biblical times , which was used to store cheap wine			1
it was found in the @entity25 area of the city , south of @entity27 , as part of a dig by the @entity103 at the @entity104			1
a word on the pitcher reads ‘ yayin ’ or wine and he believes the whole inscription should read ‘ in the year [ … ] @entity31 , wine , part , m [ … ] ’			0
professor @entity36 explained the first missing word ends with ‘ mem , ’ which is the final part of the word for the 20th or 30th year of the kingdom and effectively dates the wine			0
the middle portion or ‘ wine , part ’ indicates the type of wine contained in the jar and in the @entity124 language from northern @entity125 , a similar word to ' yayin ' means the lowest quality of wine			0
the final letter has been cut off from a longer word , but professor @entity131 thinks it could indicate where the wine came from			0
the discovery was made in the ruins of a @entity44 public structure located in the @entity57 between the city of @entity6 and the southern wall of the @entity60 , ( pictured )			0
this area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall of @entity26 dating back to the 10th century @entity7 , possibly built by @entity5 professor @entity36 recently told @entity143 : ‘ this wine was n’t served to @entity5 ’s emissaries , or in the temple , but apparently was for the slave construction workers who worked in the area			1
’ archaeologists already know that poor quality wine was drunk by soldiers and slave builders and believe that it was stored in large vessels that did not keep it particularly fresh , like the one found in the dig six months ago			2
professor @entity36 thinks the carving was produced after @entity5 had built the first temple , his palaces and city walls			0
the earthenware jar that is now known to contain cheap wine , was found in the @entity25 archaeological area in @entity26 , where other treasures , including a number of byzantine coins have been discovered the find sheds light on the @entity171 kingdom ’s sophisticated society , where many people were thought to be literate , taxes were collected and builders recruited and bought to @entity26 to build palaces and other infrastructure , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity178 on @entity26			1
some historians dispute information gleaned from the @entity181 that @entity26 was an important city , but supporters of the @entity171 accounts , including professor @entity36 , believe the inscription supports stories that tell of complicated administrative systems and a strictly hierarchical society			1
‘ scribes that could write administrative texts could also write literary and historiographic texts and this has very important implications for the study of the @entity181 and understanding the history of @entity196 in the biblical period , ’ he added			0
dr @entity198 , a lecturer in @entity181 and the @entity199 , from @entity200 told @entity201 : ‘ the inscription is written in what is variously called “ @entity203 ” or “ late @entity205 ” script			2
a 10cm medallion etched with a @entity47 , @entity46 made from a ram 's horn and a @entity51 scroll , ( pictured ) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label			0
however , the medallion dates from the @entity214 , unlike the older wine container the language is probably an early form of @entity35 , but it could be a closely related dialect spoken in @entity26 in the 10th century			1
’ he explained that at the time the inscription was made , the way words were written had not been agreed upon so some people wrote from left to right ( like @entity223 ) while others wrote in the opposite direction , like with modern @entity35 and @entity226			2
while professor @entity36 has interpreted the inscription from right to left , another academic , professor @entity227 has read it in the opposite way , but has not arrived upon a clear meaning			0
‘ irrespective of what the reading of the inscription is , it attests to someone writing @entity35 ( or a closely related language ) in the 10th century in @entity26 , probably for administrative reasons , ’ he said			2
‘ professor @entity36 suggests that this indicates that the inscription was made by some royal administration ( something like an early civil service ) and i believe that he is probably correct with that			0
' the inscription was found in @entity25 , near near @entity27 in @entity26 ( pictured ) in december last year the inscription was found among a pile of pottery ( pictured )			1
leading expert @entity245 believes the language is a primitive form of @entity35 which suggests the ancient israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought			2

the label dates from second half of the @entity23 and was discovered in the @entity25 area of @entity26 , south of @entity27
it is thought to be the most ancient @entity35 engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in the area so far
could mean @entity181 stories of @entity6 and @entity5 were not passed down orally but written down at the time and are accurate
historians believe the type of cheap wine held in the containers would have been drunk by slaves and soldiers
