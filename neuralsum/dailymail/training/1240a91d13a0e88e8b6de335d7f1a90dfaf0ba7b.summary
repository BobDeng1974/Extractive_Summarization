a @entity1 man was killed when the pilot of a light aircraft - who was banned from flying commercially - suffered an epileptic fit and crashed from 10,000ft into the @entity5			1
@entity6 , 35 , had been enjoying the holiday of a lifetime with his @entity10 girlfriend , @entity9 , 32 , when the tragedy struck off the @entity10 coast in 2008			1
ms @entity9 had bought the breathtaking flight across picturesque @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16 as a birthday present for her boyfriend			1
gift : @entity9 ( left ) had bought the flight for boyfriend @entity6 's ( right ) birthday just six days before killer flight : mr @entity6 was pictured here for the last time just minutes before the plane took off what she did not know was that the pilot of the $ 492 flight , 60 - year - old @entity29 , who also died in the incident , had been stripped of his commercial license after breaching a string of aviation rules in 2001			1
an inquest at @entity35 friday heard that @entity29 had continued to fly his own private aircraft despite the commercial ban			1
it emerged during the hearing that @entity29 was known to @entity10 @entity40 as suffering from epileptic fits , but they allowed him to keep his private pilot 's license regardless			1
on august 31 , 2008 - six days after turning 35 - mr @entity6 climbed on board the two - seater aircraft with @entity29			1
dream trip : @entity6 had been enjoying the holiday of a lifetime before tragedy struck but 13 minutes into the flight @entity29 suffered an epileptic fit in the cockpit and plunged the @entity53 into the @entity5			1
a horrified ms @entity9 watched the drama from the shoreline			1
@entity57 coroner @entity56 slammed the @entity58 and said it was ' unbelievable ' that @entity29 was still allowed to keep his private license			1
he said : ' it is unbelievable that @entity40 did not act			0
' @entity62 's report ought to have put @entity40 on red alert as to @entity29 ’s ability to fly			1
' it is also unbelievable that when dr @entity66 was briefed to assess @entity29 , a copy of this report was never provided to him , nor was he advised as to the admissions as to two previous seizures			2
' during the inquest it became obvious that @entity40 medical officers were cavalier in respect to the reports and @entity40 medical officers chose to disregard the observations of trained paramedics			2
' the court heard @entity29 had not reported any problem to air traffic control but a frantic @entity6 could be shouting to the lifeless pilot in the last cockpit recording			1
in the accidentally transmitted message an extremely upset mr @entity6 can be heard saying : ' @entity87 , what are you doing ? put it up			2
' medical evidence showed that @entity29 died from injuries caused by the impact itself but had not braced himself before hitting the water , suggesting he was unconscious			2
an autopsy found there was ' gross evidence ' that @entity29 , a pilot of 40 years , had a prior injury and scarring which could cause seizures			1
as his commercial , transport and commercial helicopter licence had been cancelled this meant he was not allowed to take paying customers in the air			0
after the hearing , mr @entity6 's mother @entity105 , 59 , said the coroner ’s report had brought the family closure after five years of campaigning			1
close : @entity6 's family were left devastated by the crash			2
he is pictured here with sister @entity114 speaking from the family home she shares with husband @entity117 , 62 , in @entity118 , @entity119 , she said : ' it ’s something that should never , ever have happened			0
something has got to happen , this ca n’t happen to another family			0
' @entity29 had no regard for anybody			2
he was a maverick , a cowboy and a liar - everything you would n’t want to know in a person			0
' @entity130 bought the ticket along with @entity6 ’s friend			2
they thought it would be something he would like to do			0
' he was n’t a daredevil			0
he knew that @entity130 had researched the flight			0
he did n’t go into things lightly			0
' the register is the one thing that really needs chasing up			0
@entity130 will pursue that and make sure something is being done			0
' she is angry at @entity40			0
we are angry at @entity40			0
' angry : @entity105 and @entity145 from @entity118 in @entity119 , look at photographs of beloved son , @entity6 @entity148 - who is suing the two @entity40 doctors responsible for medically clearing @entity29 for $ 955,000 - added : ' none of this brings @entity6 back			1
recommendations can be put forward but @entity6 is gone			2
' i ’m angry really			0
when it comes down to it @entity40 is the regulatory body and they did nothing to stop @entity29 from flying			1
' i think there needs to be a better way for people to be able to check what kind of licences pilots hold			0
' what he did in flying @entity6 was illegal and he had had his commercial licence suspended but @entity40 actually gave him the freedom			2
' mr @entity6 had been working in @entity10 following his dream of combining travel with his work as a computer games animator			1
he had just completed his most high - profile project , working for @entity172 on the @entity174 computer game , before he died			0
a spokesman for @entity40 said the organisation would ' carefully be considering ' the recommendations			0
