a new book titled how to choose a husband gives a 12 - step guide on how to seek and then hook a man in today 's ' post-feminist ' culture , which is apparently preparing young women for perpetual singledom			1
author @entity8 , who also wrote 7 myths of @entity10 and the flipside of @entity12 , believes a submissive wife who gives up on her dreams for marriage and motherhood is the best way to maintain a lasting union			1
the 45 - year - old married mother - of - two explains : ' our post-feminist culture is toxic			1
it celebrates women at the exclusion of men ; it ignores the needs of children ; and it glorifies the single life ... sadly , more women than not will allow this poison to invade their bodies and even ruin their lives			1
' happily ever after : how to choose a husband gives a 12 - step guide on how to seek and then hook a man in today 's ' post-feminist ' culture , which is apparently preparing young women for perpetual singledom ms @entity8 believes young women 's mothers , who drummed in the ideology that being an independent woman , with equal pay , was something to strive for , are to blame			1
' [ mothers ] did their daughters a great disservice			2
they were wrong to tell their daughters they could never rely on a man , ' wrote the author , who has built a career on challenging feminism and questioning contemporary female freedoms			2
on equal pay , she continues : ' women do n’t make as much as men precisely because they do n’t work the same number of hours			2
women continue to take years off the job to care for their children or aging parents or to live a more balanced life			2
feminists leave that part out			2
' you also need to recognize your enemy , ' she adds			2
' culture is working against you every step of the way ... at the moment , the single greatest problem your generation faces is the relentless anti-male / pro-female rhetoric you 're exposed to			0
' ms @entity8 believes that to have a happy marriage , it is these gender difference we have to embrace , rather than rail against			1
for example , ' men are hunters			0
they want to build things and kill things — that ’s why more men than women shoot guns , ' she writes			0
' mothers were wrong to tell their daughters they could never rely on a man ' ' it ’s why male engineers greatly outnumber female engineers			0
females , on the other hand , like to gather and nest — that ’s why more women than men like to shop and bake , or stay home with their kids			0
' women also like to get all dressed up and prance about in their heels			0
and men love to watch women prance about in their heels			0
that ’s the yin and yang of gender relations			1
' in one chapter , she also asks that women ' decide to stay ' a plea to ensure people do n't give up on marriage when things get tough , which seems like sound advice for both men and women a like , regardless of their stance on gender equality for women			1
in a case against day care , nannies , and full - time work , she also advises : ' accept it : you ca n’t have it all			0
' anti-feminism : @entity8 , author of how to choose a husband , believes a submissive wife who gives up on her dreams for marriage and motherhood is the best way to maintain a lasting union ' making choices is part of life , she writes			1
' you ca n’t go to every party			0
you ca n’t go on every vacation			0
you ca n’t go to every college			0
' and above all , she writes of the ideal wife 's role : ' just be nice , cook , and have sex ! ' ms @entity8 has faced criticism for her new book , which some have nicknamed : ' how not to choose a husband			1
' @entity157 's @entity156 wrote : ' @entity8 thinks women like me — working mothers who expect things from their husbands — are unhappy , and are making their spouses and children unhappy too			1
' while @entity165 's @entity164 explained : ' it 's a fairly large assumption to make - that all men want a return to a 1950s mentality , when their family was completely dependent on the success of their job			0
and just because a marriage survives does n't necessarily mean it 's a happy one			1
' but ms @entity8 , who recently wrote a @entity177 op - ed titled @entity178 , where she blamed the decline of marriageable males on feminists , insists that @entity185 women ' need a detox '			1
' if they want to be happy , or just plain satisfied , they must do a 180 when it comes to their attitude toward sex , courtship , and married life			0
' if they do , marriageable men will reappear -- and women will find the love that eludes them , ' says her book .			0
