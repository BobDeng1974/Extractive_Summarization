by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 19:27 est , 21 november 2012 living in a cold home is a ' major factor ' in two out of five extra winter deaths crippling energy prices and badly insulated homes will lead to the loss of thousands of lives and seriously damage older people ’s health this winter , warns a new report			1
it shows cold homes are costing the @entity13 £ 1.36 billion every year in hospital and primary care as older people struggle with respiratory problems , stroke and heart attacks triggered by the cold			0
around 27,000 excess winter deaths are expected this year , including avoidable fatalities among older people , says the charity @entity24			1
in a new report @entity26 , it says a ‘ major factor ’ in two out of five extra winter deaths is living in a cold home			1
it says superior building standards in countries like @entity34 and @entity35 which insist on insulation and double glazing mean they have warmer homes than in the @entity24 , which has a milder climate			2
there are higher rates of excess winter deaths - above what would normally be expected - in @entity44 compared with @entity46 countries			1
older people living in cold homes are at higher risk of death and illnesses such as arthritis and rheumatism , with the risks going up as temperatures plummet			0
there are around 8,000 extra deaths for every one degree drop in average temperature			1
temperatures lower than 16 degrees appear to impair respiratory functions , those below 12 degrees place strain on the cardiovascular system and temperatures below six degrees place people at risk of hypothermia , say researchers			0
people living in the coldest homes are three times as likely to die from a cold - related illness compared to those in warmer homes , says the report			2
‘ the prevalence of poorly insulated homes coupled with sharp increases in energy prices over recent years has exacerbated the @entity24 ’s growing fuel poverty problem , forcing many older people to cut back on their heating in a bid to control costs ’ says the report			0
millions of older people are having to choose between staying warm and energy bills they can afford , the report warns @entity91 , charity director general at @entity24 said ‘ it ’s an absolute scandal that tens of thousands of older people will become ill or die this winter because they are unable to keep warm			2
‘ not only is this resulting in an incalculable human cost but the @entity13 is spending more than a billion pounds on treating the casualties of cold every year			0
‘ at the root of the problem are badly insulated homes , which together with cripplingly high energy prices , are leaving millions of older people having to choose between staying warm and energy bills they can afford			0
‘ we are calling on all local authorities to recognise the issue as a major health priority and make sure they are doing everything within their power to keep older people warm			0
‘ the government must also invest in a major energy efficiency programme to help insulate older people against the cold weather and the high cost of energy ’ she said			0
the @entity24 report found two - fifths of people wrongly see hypothermia as the biggest threat to older people ’s health in winter , as it accounts for only one in 100 excess winter deaths			1
the most common risk factor is cardiovascular diseases – strokes caused by blood - clotting or heart attacks – which account for 40 per cent of excess winter deaths			1
last year a report found poor insulation means £ 1 in every £ 4 spent heating homes in @entity44 is wasted .			2

age @entity24 report says living in a cold home is a ' major factor ' in two out of five extra winter deaths
rates in @entity44 higher than @entity46 , which has colder winters - but better insulation
around 8,000 extra deaths for every one degree drop in average temperature
