by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 08:40 est , 17 september 2013 with years of training required to become an itamae - a traditional @entity4 chef - it 's not surprising that food is something of an art in @entity8			1
but one creative cook has taken her technique even further - by literally creating ' sushi artworks '			1
@entity12 - otherwise known as llustrator @entity13 - shapes her rice and seaweed rolls into a range of designs , from bite - sized cartoons of cats and flowers , to copies of famous portraits such as @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity26 's @entity25			1
@entity27 - scream - i : @entity12 has created works of art that are exposed when she slices her rice and seaweed rolls the @entity34 chef uses food dye , soy sauce and green wasabi to colour the rice to make her ' makizushi ' or ' rolled sushi ' creations			1
in traditional fashion , seaweed , rice and other ingredients - such as raw fish , ginger and vegetables - are laid out on a bamboo mat to be rolled up into one cylindrical wrap , ready to be cut into six or eight pieces			1
this is when tama - chan lines up the components of her own makizushi , visualising how the cross-sections will look when everything is sliced up			2
' i never know what the inside looks like so i 'm never sure if it will come out the way i imagined , ' the artist wrote			0
' and i ca n't make edits when i 'm done			0
' facial expressions are especially difficult because small ingredients or putting on too much force when you 're wrapping the rolls can completely throw things off			0
' it 's always a special moment when i make the first incision to reveal an image			0
' rice kitty : a plate featuring cats and flowers is one of the classics @entity79 recreates as a traditional @entity4 dish sublime to ridiculous : @entity24 's @entity23 - or a pot of instant noodles - the @entity34 illustrator lets her creativity run wild treasure trove : a full set of fish , seaweed and veg accompanies this bento box of delights on her kookily - named website ' @entity96 smile of @entity12 ' , the ] artist describes her mission to ' encourage food education and enjoyment and get people to communicate ' through her fun food			1
' when you see that roll of rice , the thrill and excitement of not knowing what that picture will look like until you cut it is unbearable ! ' she promises			0
traditionally , @entity4 sushi chefs train for up to 20 years - although shorter apprenticeships are more common in less exclusive restaurants , particularly outside @entity8			1
an itamae - which translates as ' in front of the board ' - needs to know the correct etiquette around customers , how to move about the kitchen and how to handle utensils			0
sea - weird : some of the creations echo the childlike cartoons of @entity4 manga designer diner : @entity12 often uses coloured rice in her creations under the knife : skulls and a baby in the womb are among the more bizarre creations that tama - chan exhibits to people who take part in her sushi - making workshops knowing by sight whether the raw fish is safe to eat or not is also a key skill			1
it takes around five years of training for an apprentice chef to be allowed to prepare the rice to the restaurant 's particular recipe			2
they then graduate to ' wakiita ' level ( ' near the cutting board ' ) , with the duty of preparing fresh ingredients , before becoming a fully - fledged itamae			0
but @entity12 has set up workshops offering @entity34 residents the chance to watch her make her sushi artworks and have a go under her watchful eye			2
the sushi designer also offers courses in @entity161 to give foreigners the chance to prove their credentials as the next rice @entity166			0
soy sunrise : a blob of raw fish becomes a burning sun in this sushi creation mer - miso : themed dishes such as this shell plate match the sushi artworks that are displayed on them			2
