the immediate assumption one has on hearing that an academic has won the @entity2 is that he must always have been a brilliant and hard - working individual who was marked out for golden success			2
in the case of the @entity7 scientist sir @entity6 , who won the @entity8 this week , we were roundly disabused of this notion when he let it be known that his school science report began with the word ‘ @entity13 ’ — and went downhill from there			1
‘ i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist , ’ his biology teacher wrote			1
‘ on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ; if he ca n’t learn simple biological facts he would have no chance of doing the work of a specialist , and it would be a sheer waste of time , both on his part , and of those who have to teach him			2
’ sir @entity6 , who won the @entity8 in october , says human cloning could happen within 50 years @entity6 ’s work was ‘ far from satisfactory ’			1
one effort ‘ scored two marks out of a possible 50 ’			2
in a class of 18 at @entity33 , this master placed @entity34			2
and yet , 79 - year - old @entity6 has for decades been pre-eminent in the field of cloning and cell research			1
true , there are those who have questioned some of the ethical issues arising out of his work			2
it is as a direct consequence of his endeavours , for example , that other scientists decided to proceed with cloning @entity48			1
he has also been at the vanguard of defending genetically modified crops			2
but no one in recent years has questioned sir @entity6 ’s brilliance , nor his dedication to his work			1
even when he was the master of @entity56 at @entity7 , with administrative responsibility to students and scholars , sir @entity6 never let up in his scientific work , and was hard at it in the laboratory even on days when he had also to attend fundraising meetings and the like			1
' i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist			1
on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ... and it would be a sheer waste of time ' some people will read this story and remark how foolish the science teacher was			2
not since 1895 , when a @entity76 science teacher said that little @entity78 ‘ will never amount to anything ’ could anyone have got a budding scientist so wrong			1
but there is another way of looking at it			2
is it not possible that this patently honest report is one of the reasons why @entity6 went on to such great heights ? in most schools today , the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times , even when they have achieved nothing spectacular			1
if a small child at kindergarten rolls a piece of @entity98 into the shape of a garden worm , the class is expected to be as impressed as if he had moulded it into the shape of the @entity103			2
at assemblies , the most feeble , inaudible lisped readings and songs are greeted with wild applause			2
and later on , in the modern child ’s school - days , it is thought desirable to continue praising and emphasising the positive			1
pre-eminent : as a direct consequence of sir @entity6 's endeavours , other scientists decided to proceed with cloning @entity48 ( pictured ) thus the recent , welcome , decision to raise the bar for @entity120 passes and to admit finally that some children could not spell , or write grammatically , or remember the books they had been studying , was greeted with howls of outrage and seen as unfair , and even cruel			1
the truth is that in state schools , proper school reports are a thing of the past			1
the old cliche — ‘ could do better ’ — is no longer allowed			2
it ’s considered too harsh for the poor dears			0
but the fact is that unless someone tells a young pupil that they could do better , they never will do better			0
they are left with the lie that they could not improve — even if they tried			0
in any case , trying is not something which they are encouraged to do			0
conned by artificially high grades at @entity148 , which are doled out by cynical examination boards touting for custom ( the boards get paid by schools which choose them , so it is in their interest to make things easy ) , whole generations of school - children have never received criticism of the kind stingingly — and helpfully — delivered by @entity6 ’s @entity33 master			1
' @entity159 from satisfactory ' : in a class of 18 at @entity33 ( pictured ) , sir @entity6 's teachers placed him 18th after he ' scored two marks out of a possible 50 ' indeed , many students receiving such a rebuke today would probably need counselling , or their parents would write off to a solicitor seeking redress			1
for his part , @entity6 became a great scientist , not because he was a conceited , lazy boy , who thought he knew it all , when he did not			1
he became a great scientist when he stopped being that boy , and learned the tough lessons that his biology master wanted to teach him : get your facts right , apply yourself , learn to be humble in respect of facts , work hard			1
of course , sir @entity6 has rightly been seen as one of a number of high achievers who were either slow starters , or whose genius was not spotted at school			1
so wrong : a @entity76 science teacher said that little @entity78 ' will never amount to anything ' @entity189 is the classic case of the boy who was largely unloved by his parents , and unappreciated by the teachers			0
when he was an eight - year - old attending a private school called @entity195 ’s , @entity196 , @entity189 was said by his teacher to be ‘ a very naughty boy ’ and ‘ a constant trouble to everybody and is always in some scrape or other			1
he can not be trusted to behave himself anywhere ’			0
actually , @entity189 ’s anarchic and ungovernable behaviour — which got him into many scrapes in his political career — were part of what made him so unpredictable and successful a warlord			0
when he went on to @entity210 , his housemaster despairingly wrote : ‘ he is so regular in his irregularity that i really do n’t know what to do			0
’ ( by contrast , in @entity216 , in @entity215 , a schoolmaster was writing that his pupil was ‘ very satisfactory ’ in his ‘ moral conduct			0
religious instruction , adequate ; freehand drawing good ’			0
it was , of course , @entity224 )			0
there are countless examples of school reports of successful people which are hardly complimentary — yet which show the teachers had seen something in their pupils that would go on being part of their later character			1
@entity189 could certainly make colossal mistakes and be ‘ a constant trouble to everybody ’ — that turned out to be part of his greatness			0
and the important thing is that his teachers were happy to express their firmly held opinions of him			0
the rot set in from the @entity245 when teachers ’ training colleges all started going barmy , and it was considered wicked to correct children ’s mistakes			0
this was also the period from which educational standards generally started to plummet			0
too harsh : in schools today the ethos is that children must be congratulated at all times , even when achieving nothing spectacular but unless someone tells a pupil that they could improve , they will never do better if you are a dedicated teacher with a passion for your subject and a real love for your pupils , you will go on and on correcting them until they achieve excellence			0
but this approach did not fit in with the prevailing ethos of the educational establishment , which meant core subjects suffered			0
in maths , science , languages , and history , it is essential to get your facts and grammar right			0
unsurprisingly , there has been a marked decline in these subjects in @entity283 education across the past 40 years , and a growth in so - called subjects where there is no right or wrong answer — such as design , creative writing , media studies , international relations , business studies , fashion , psychology — subjects where no one lets facts get in their way			0
by contrast , life - changing medical research such as that conducted by sir @entity6 , depends upon actually knowing things			1
and knowing things is only possible if some teacher has been brave enough to tell the pupils when they have got something wrong			0
all through the party conference season we have been treated to the boring spectacle of politicians vying with one another to raise the number of @entity283 students in higher education			0
but what is the point of doing so if these students are not studying anything useful ? and how can anyone be expected to study something useful unless at an early stage a school teacher has been honest enough , caring enough , to say — as that biology teacher did all those years ago to a young @entity6 : ‘ if you go on making mistakes like that , you ’ll never make anything of your life			1
it would be a sheer waste of time			0

he went on to become pre-eminent in the field of cloning and cell research
