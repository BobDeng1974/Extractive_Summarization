by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:01 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 11 april 2013 @entity2 might have power as deputy prime minister but it seems being a self - confessed ' major devotee ' of @entity6 was not enough to prevent a fresh slump in clothing sales at the high street retailer			1
the @entity11 leader surprised listeners to his radio phone - in when he revealed he buys his underpants and socks from @entity6 during a discussion about another poor set of sales figures			1
@entity6 today posted its seventh straight quarterly fall in non-food sales today , as the group failed to show any improvement in its range of clothing and homewares			1
asked about the figures on @entity38 , mr @entity2 gave a bit too much away : ' oh i am a major devotee of @entity6 ’s clothing , particularly some articles which i normally would n’t talk about on a family radio programme			1
' no i was thinking to myself i ’m going to go out and buy some extra pairs of socks			0
' deputy prime minister @entity2 ssaid he did not think people went to @entity6 for fashion however , he also cast doubt on whether @entity6 's fortunes can be revived with a focus on high - end fashion			1
' well i think it ’s a great store			0
i heard on the radio this morning them saying that they ’re not doing well with fashion items , but i ’ve never thought of … do you go to @entity6 for fashion ? you go to @entity6 for sort of value for money clothing and i ’m not the greatest fashion commercial			1
' the 129 year - old retailer , which has become the subject of takeover speculation in recent months , said sales at its non-food division at stores open over a year fell 3.8 per cent in the 13 weeks to march 30 , its fiscal fourth quarter			1
the figures were slightly better than expected			0
but @entity6 , which serves 21million customers a week from over 700 @entity71 stores , had to again rely on strong food sales to support overall growth			2
chief executive @entity74 is under pressure to recover @entity6 's clothing performance after a poor 2012 and disappointing @entity78 sales			1
he has previously warned a new general merchandise management team led by @entity80 , the former boss of food , will not make a major impact on sales until @entity6 launches its autumn / winter collections in july			2
but the 3.8 per cent fall in non-food sales was still better than many in the @entity87 had expected			2
most @entity87 analysts had forecast a fall of 4.6 per cent and a revised fall of 3.8 per cent in the third quarter as @entity6 moved to protect its profit margins by offering fewer discounts in the run up to @entity78			2
@entity6 shares were trading 3.6 per cent higher at 397.6p in @entity95 following the release of the results			0
they closed yesterday at 384p , valuing the business at £ 6.1 billion			0
last month @entity6 shares hit a 28 - month high after a newspaper report that the @entity103 state of @entity104 was planning a bid			0
a source close to state - owned @entity107 denied the report , but speculation of possible private equity interest has persisted			0
‘ the fourth quarter was n't as bad as some had expected , ’ said @entity111 , director of the retail consultants , @entity112			2
' general merchandise is clearly still struggling but these numbers will buy @entity74 a few more months			1
@entity117 for @entity74 will come later this year			1
’ the trading update also encouraged @entity119 , investment research manager at @entity121 to rate @entity6 shares as a ‘ buy ’			0
‘ the turnaround of its clothing operation is key to the chief executive keeping his job and we believe that it is tackling the problems in its women ’s wear and general merchandise operations			1
in response to investors , the chief executive has drawn a line in the sand with the expectation of delivering better performance by the autumn , as the retailer prepares to re-vitalise its clothing ranges , mr @entity119 said			1
‘ investors may be encouraged to see @entity6 post the fastest quarterly sales growth in almost two years			2
’ food sales on the same basis rose 4 per cent versus analyst forecasts of an increase of 1.9 - 3.5 per cent and a third quarter rise of 0.3 per cent			1
total @entity71 like - for - like sales rose 0.6 per cent			2
‘ we are working hard on improving our performance in general merchandise and , despite difficult trading conditions , we made progress in our operational execution , ’ @entity74 said			1
‘ in january we said we expect the pressure on consumers ' disposable incomes to continue throughout 2013			2
as a result we were cautious about the outlook for the year ahead and this view remains unchanged			0
’ @entity71 retailers are facing difficult times as consumers has been curtailed by worries over job security and a squeeze on incomes			0
about two - thirds of @entity71 ’s economic growth comes from consumer spending			0
@entity6 ’s trading update reflected sentiment elsewhere on the high street			0
a survey earlier this week said growth in underlying @entity71 retail sales slowed last month despite a boost from an early @entity180 , as unseasonably cold weather hurt demand for summer clothes and shoes			0
last month , @entity185 reported slower trading conditions since the beginning of february			0
department store @entity188 issued a profit warning , blaming january snow .			0
