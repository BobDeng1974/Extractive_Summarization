by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has wrecked @entity5 's @entity4 career @entity6 , gayle and @entity8 deserve @entity4 recognition for years and years @entity11 fans knew nothing about trophies			1
odd - shaped silver things that never came anywhere near @entity16			0
and then @entity17 arrived with billions of pounds and he was ready to pump endless stacks of cash into the club			0
good luck to him and his club i say			0
if he ’s prepared to spend big , put money into football and make @entity11 fans happy at the same time – why not ? the control freaks at @entity29 need to wind their necks in and deal with bigger issues in the game			2
just the start : @entity34 lifts the @entity36 trophy after @entity11 beat @entity37 on sunday to win the title by two points next level : @entity42 and city manager @entity41 must now conquer @entity43 in 2014 - 2015 investment return : @entity45 ( second right ) expects a constant stream of silverware for the millions he has pumped into the club winning trophies would n’t be the difficult part – @entity41 was gifted £ 100m worth of players last summer , and not all of them regulars in the starting line - up			1
that ’s a lot of garnish alongside the already brilliant players including this season ’s true stars @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity34			0
you ’ve got to be pretty useless not to win silverware with the current @entity11 squad			1
the difficult part for @entity45 is raising the expectations of @entity11 fans			1
they are stuck in their old ways : they did n’t want @entity77 to go after he had won a title and an @entity79 – he was still a hero to the supporters			0
never mind that he ’d completely lost the dressing room			0
the fans held the @entity83 aloft like it was something revered in @entity85			2
if @entity45 was excited about it when they beat @entity88 at @entity89 , a little bit of research would reveal last year ’s final was between @entity93 and @entity94			2
just the beginning : @entity41 's first piece of silverware was the @entity83 in march , but this trophy is bottom of @entity11 's priority list warning signs : @entity77 was sacked after failing to win a trophy last season fair to say the @entity83 might excite the success - starved @entity11 fans trying to make up for all those lost years after @entity108 ’s overhead kick , but it ’s not why the billions are being pumped in			1
winning that trophy was almost embarrassing for a mega-rich club like @entity11			2
no , the owners made it clear when they arrived they want to be “ winning in @entity43			0
” the @entity114 is everything to the @entity45 , along with the kudos of being accepted at the same table as @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
domestic domination is seen as inevitable for @entity11 by @entity85			0
the managers they appoint will be judged by what they achieve in @entity43 , and to that end , @entity41 failed this season			1
domination : @entity11 's owners want to emulate the achievements of @entity119 at home and abroad not bad : @entity41 and @entity64 size up the @entity36 trophy during @entity11 's open - top bus parade on monday i ’m not saying he ’s about to get the chop – far from it			1
but he should be aware that 18 months before @entity77 was sacked , the owner had declared that his manager was on “ the right path ” and it would “ take time ” as @entity11 were heading out of the @entity114			0
there is nothing wrong with @entity11 fans , who have been @entity144 ’s embarrassing inferior little brother for decades , enjoying every piece of success and silverware their club gives them , and waving it all right in front of every @entity144 fan ’s face			2
but the owners set a higher standard than a @entity83 and another @entity36 title			1
they want @entity43 domination for @entity11			1
anything less is failure .			0

for the millions invested , @entity11 should expect to win the @entity36
@entity83 success is almost an *irrelevance*
@entity41 needs to conquer @entity43 *sooner* rather than later
@entity45 demands place at top table with @entity119 and @entity120
