in the first case of its kind , a @entity1 appeals court has rejected an animal rights advocate 's bid to extend ' legal personhood ' to chimpanzees , saying the primates are incapable of bearing the responsibilities that come with having legal rights			1
the unanimous ruling meant that @entity13 , a 26 - year - old chimpanzee is not entitled to the rights of a human and does not have to be freed by its owner a five - judge panel of the @entity19 court on thursday said attorney @entity20 had shown that @entity13 , who lives alone in a shed in @entity21 , was an autonomous creature , but that it was not possible for him to understand the social contract that binds humans together			1
' so far as legal theory is concerned , a person is any being whom the law regards as capable of rights and duties , ' presiding justice @entity38 wrote			2
' needless to say , unlike human beings , chimpanzees can not bear any legal duties , submit to societal responsibilities or be held legally accountable for their actions , ' that , they ruled , makes it ' inappropriate ' to grant the rights of a human to the animal			1
@entity20 , representing the @entity33 , which he helped found in 2007 , was seeking a ruling that @entity13 had been unlawfully imprisoned by his owner , @entity53			2
@entity20 argued that the chimp should be released to a sanctuary in @entity56			0
according to @entity20 and other experts , it is the first case anywhere in the world in which an appeals court has been asked to extend human rights to animals			1
there was no initial response to an email sent to @entity20 with a question about the possibility of a further appeal to the state 's top court			0
@entity13 's owner , @entity53 , said thursday he was pleased and expected the ruling			2
' i just could n't picture any court granting habeas corpus for an animal , ' he said			0
' if it works for one animal , it works for all animals			0
it would open a can of worms			0
