@entity1 has more rapists in jail than any other @entity5 country , research shows			1
there were 5,408 prisoners serving rape sentences in @entity9 and @entity10 in 2013 , compared to 3,600 in @entity11 , 2,287 in @entity12 and just 2,034 in @entity13 , a report by the @entity15 reveals			1
the figures could be attributed to tougher sentencing guidelines , higher reporting rates and more ' progressive ' rape laws , according to women 's charities			1
leading : there were 5,408 prisoners serving rape sentences in @entity9 and @entity10 in 2013 , compared to 3,600 in @entity11 , 2,287 in @entity12 and just 2,034 in @entity13 , a report by the @entity15 reveals the number of rapes in @entity1 hit a record high in 2013 - with more than 35 women attacked every day according to the latest official figures , released in october			1
while this accounts for between just 20 and 25 per cent of rapes committed , the government claims - others place the estimate at 10 and 15 per cent - it is still higher than other @entity35 countries			0
reporting rates in @entity11 fall at roughly 11 per cent , according to a study published by the @entity38 of @entity39 , in @entity40 , @entity11 , in 2011			1
while in @entity13 , 92 per cent of rapes are not reported to police , according to the 2009 @entity44 @entity43 â€™s database on @entity45			1
this higher reporting rate in @entity1 means that there are more opportunities for the offenders to be prosecuted , convicted and jail - contributing to the larger number of rapists in jailed			1
@entity52 , acting director of the @entity53 , said : ' the relatively high sentencing rate for the @entity1 does not necessarily indicate that there are more rapists here			2
' @entity57 ' : the @entity58 , @entity59 , said last month it was time to move past ' no means no ' when investigating rape ' only about 10 - 15 per cent of rapes are reported to the police in the @entity1 but this rate is still one of the highest in @entity35 and means more perpetrators are prosecuted and then sentenced			2
' numbers of rape cases coming to court in the past two years in @entity1 have also risen by 30 per cent			2
of the cases sent to prosecutors for trial in 2012/2013 , around 60 per cent result in convictions			0
however , this represented a drop on 3 per cent from the previous year			0
tougher sentencing guidelines are one of the reasons there could be a higher number of @entity1 jailed for rape than in other @entity35 countries			1
between 2005 and 2011 - the most recent set of data available - there has been an increase of 20.1 - month increase in the length of sentence for raping a woman			0
it is now more than eight years			0
the average sentence for raping a man rose by 28 months over the same period to more than eight years			1
ms @entity52 added that the law on rape in the @entity1 , which based on a definition of the absence of consent , is ' clearer and more progressive than many other countries '			2
last month , the @entity102 announced a major overhaul to the way rape cases are investigated , saying it was time to move past ' no means no '			2
the @entity58 , @entity59 , said she wanted police to ask suspects how they knew the alleged victim was saying yes , and was doing so ' freely and knowingly '			0
the @entity102 wants to tighten the law against offenders who target people incapacitated through drink or drugs , or where the alleged rapist holds a position of power over the victim			0
questions on consent should also be raised where the complainant has mental health problems or learning difficulties , it was said			0
tougher sentencing : between 2005 and 2011 - the most recent set of data available - there has been an increase of 20.1 - month increase in the length of sentence for raping a woman			1
( above , file image ) this means it can be more straightforward for the @entity102 to convict rapists - and increases the chance of them being sentenced to time in prison			2
ms @entity52 noted : ' some other countires are still examining rape as though it must involve physical force and resistance for example which is not the case here			0
' but , she added : ' the fact is that the @entity1 's reporting rates are still very low and we also still fail to ask the question about what survivors of rape want in terms of justice and for support services - there is no guarantee of long - term counselling and support here			0
there 's a long way for all @entity5 states to go			0
