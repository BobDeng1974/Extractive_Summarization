a special undercover squad of @entity2 officers tasked with infiltrating a range of left - wing organisations may have duped more than 100 women into having affairs			1
the @entity7 which operated between 1968 and 2008 has been heavily criticised because officers attached to the unit had sexual relations with some of their targets			1
the @entity2 has already paid out more than £ 400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child fathered by undercover officer @entity15			1
undercover police officer @entity15 , pictured , was tasked with infiltrating the @entity16 while undercover during the 1980s , @entity15 fathered a son with a woman while using the @entity20 alias @entity15 , who used the alias @entity20 , began a relationship with the woman , known only as @entity24 after he was tasked with infiltrating the @entity16			1
the @entity2 has confirmed that it deployed 147 @entity7 officers in undercover roles over a four - decade period			1
it is feared that compensation claims against the force could run into a mulit - million pound bill for damages and legal fees			2
according to a source who spoke to @entity34 : ' in nine out of ten cases we know about , @entity7 officers have had sexual relationships while undercover			1
there were nearly 150 of them , so it would not be unreasonable to suggest there are many more out there who do n't realise they are victims			0
' @entity24 is reportedly to receive £ 425,000 and in an interview with the @entity46 and the @entity47 , she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children			2
she said : ‘ the legal case is finished but there is no closure for me			0
there is the money , but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong , there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers			0
’ ‘ i do n't know why i was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with @entity15			2
‘ i do n't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour i went through giving birth to our son			0
’ it is feared that undercover officers may have slept with more than 100 women over a 40 - year period in august four former @entity7 officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions			1
the @entity82 said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences			0
the @entity2 was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after high court judge mr @entity91 ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘ neither confirm nor deny ’ ( @entity95 ) in response to the damages claims			2
as a result , the force confirmed @entity100 and @entity15 were undercover police officers			2
@entity102 , @entity24 's lawyer , told the @entity46 and @entity47 that sir @entity103 , the @entity2 commissioner , should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships			1
undercover police officer @entity100 , also known as @entity107 was part of the covert surveillance squad so far 12 woman have lodged cases against the @entity2 over the actions of its undercover surveillance officers mr @entity102 told them : ‘ the @entity2 are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer , @entity15			1
they are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself			0
‘ it is time for the commissioner of @entity2 to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice ’			0
a @entity129 spokesman said the force ‘ unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with @entity15 , an undercover officer , has had on this woman ’ but said that it had ‘ never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing ’			1
he said : ‘ we recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son			2
from the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity , completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances			0
we regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress			0
‘ we want to be , and have tried hard to be , as open as we possibly can			0
arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing , but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic			0

the @entity2 deployed 147 officers in deep cover over 40 years
the @entity7 was established in 1968 to target radicals
@entity7 officers had sexual relations with women using their alias cover names
so far 12 woman have lodged cases in the @entity176 over the claims
