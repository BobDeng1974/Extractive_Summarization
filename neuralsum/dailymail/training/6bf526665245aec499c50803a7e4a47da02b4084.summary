so much for being a two - man team			0
the @entity2 had talked endlessly in the build - up about targeting @entity4 and @entity5 , as if taking down those two would lead naturally to the @entity6 heading back across the @entity7			1
the wisdom of that theory was rather shot to pieces on a fascinating first day , as any number of fearless @entity13 stood up to be counted to turn a one - point deficit at lunch into a handy 5 - 3 advantage			1
an out - of - sorts @entity4 contributed just a half point and @entity5 suffered a rare defeat , so to that end the @entity2 plan might be said to have worked			1

most of all , there was the prodigious gifts and warrior instincts of @entity39 and his @entity100 partner @entity42			1
@entity102 ’s partnership with @entity5 might have been broken up but the former is fast compiling a @entity6 record of which the latter would be proud			1
the two points he contributed on friday with @entity42 takes his overall record to eight victories from 11 matches spread over three @entity111			2
@entity102 is one of those mr @entity112 who could play with anyone			2
he has taken over the role of largely unsung hero @entity80 used to play			2
here in the tricky breezy conditions he was immense and the competitor in @entity42 rose to the challenge of being an able partner			2
average by his standards in the morning , the @entity100 was at his awesome best following the break			0
as ever , the first day of this 40th edition had plenty that intrigued and lots to analyse ; plenty to keep fans of the sport and beyond in rapt conversation at the 19th hole			0
at its heart lay an astonishing decision from @entity2 captain @entity133 that sucked all the momentum built up by the visitors in the morning and left them crestfallen at the finish			2
the story at half - time was that @entity23 had somehow contrived to lose yet another series despite winning one match comfortably and leading two more with just the final three holes to play			1
they would lose one and halve the other to concede the first series by a point			0
that took their record to two wins out of the last 12 series of fourballs and foursomes			0

comfortably the best golf in the morning was played by the youngest @entity2 partnership in @entity6 history — 21 - year - old @entity88 and 24 - year - old @entity89			1
to be fair , it was a @entity83 masterstroke to pair them together , for they did n’t just take down @entity5 and local hero @entity87 — they wiped the floor with them			1
the two rookies were full of it afterwards and rightly so			0
they were the talk of the @entity184			0
the @entity2 present were buoyant			2
who would the new american dream pairing be taking on in the afternoon ? they were benched			0
world number one @entity4 and @entity22 ( pictured ) turned their fortunes around to salvage a halve after losing their morning session on friday @entity5 during his game on friday morning against @entity89 and @entity88 as him and @entity87 lost 5 & 4 in the morning session @entity67 of the @entity2 reacts after his putt on the 11th green during the afternoon foursomes of the @entity38 on the @entity201 course at @entity55 @entity23 's @entity22 ( right ) of @entity202 and @entity4 of @entity76 talk during the foursomes matches against @entity32 and @entity31 @entity205 's graphic shows why it is good @entity23 started brightly against @entity2 naturally , they could not believe it			1
who could ? they pleaded with their captain			0
‘ they ’re very upset with me right now , ’ admitted @entity83			2
they were not alone , among those with @entity2 interests at heart			2
and so the momentum shifted			0
@entity79 and @entity80 were majestic in beating the noted foursomes players , @entity81 and @entity78 , on the final hole			1
@entity219 , now 44 and with an arthritic condition , looked like a man who could hardly believe he was being sent out again , and played tired golf — who would have thought that ? — in losing to @entity60 and @entity58			1
even @entity2 ’s only half point in the afternoon must have felt like a loss as world @entity228 and world no 3 @entity22 came back from two down with two to play			1
what a start we had to proceedings			0
it is an incredible logistical exercise to get 50,000 people on to a golf course situated in the middle of nowhere for a 7.35am start but the hardy @entity6 regulars , as ever , were up for it			2
the park - and - ride car parks started filling up at 5am and by the time the gates opened at 6am , there were thousands waiting to make the mad dash for the best seats in the 3,000 - capacity grandstand around the first tee			0
by 6.15am , some 45 minutes before the sun started peeking above the @entity250 , there were no unoccupied seats at all			0
@entity252 revealed a magnificent landscape , with spectators occupying every possible vantage point — and soon the songs began			0
‘ ten - six , and you still ca n’t win , ’ was one chant , a reference to the epic turn of events at @entity261			0
@entity83 was first out for @entity2 and when he cupped his hand to his ear the thrilled crowd knew what that meant			1
so it was he boomeranged the ball in trademark fashion to a deafening ‘ @entity272 ’ accompaniment			0
that , however , was as good as it got for the @entity275 champion and his hapless partner @entity84			0
a special reception was afforded @entity5 and local hero , @entity87			1
@entity5 pounded his chest , the frustrated footballer to the end			0
it looked as if the occasion was too much for @entity87 , while @entity5 lost for the first time in eight @entity6 matches			1
curiously , all four of his defeats have come on the opening day			0
just a minuscule contribution in points terms from @entity4 and @entity5 , then , but no matter			1
to @entity2 chagrin , this was the day @entity13 golf displayed all its considerable strength in depth			0
@entity4 of @entity23 and @entity22 talk during a press conference after the afternoon foursomes of the @entity38 on the @entity201 course @entity4 of @entity23 puts his arm around @entity22 during their post-win press conference after the afternoon foursomes of the @entity38 on friday @entity2 captain @entity133 congratulates @entity89 after he and @entity88 beat @entity5 and @entity87 in the morning session on the first day @entity4 had a tough morning against @entity67 and @entity66 but fared better against @entity32 and @entity31 in the afternoon @entity42 put in a good shift for @entity23 , beating @entity83 and @entity84 5 & 4 then @entity48 and @entity49 2 & 1 with teammate @entity39			1

the 40th @entity6 got *underway* on the @entity307 at @entity55 on friday with @entity23 leading 5 - 3
@entity23 took early lead as @entity39 and @entity42 beat @entity83 and @entity84 5 & 4
@entity2 leveled the match as rookies @entity89 and @entity88 beat @entity87 and @entity5 5 & 4
@entity31 and @entity32 salvaged a halve on the 18th against @entity85 and @entity86
@entity66 and @entity67 claimed opening session victory on the last against @entity4 and @entity22
@entity80 and @entity79 brought @entity23 level against @entity81 and @entity78 in afternoon foursomes
@entity102 and @entity42 beat @entity48 and @entity49 to put @entity23 back in front
@entity4 and @entity22 produced a late *fightback* to claim a halve against @entity31 and @entity32 and put @entity23 4 - 3 ahead
@entity58 and @entity60 win 3 & 2 against @entity2 's @entity66 and @entity67 to make it 5 - 3
