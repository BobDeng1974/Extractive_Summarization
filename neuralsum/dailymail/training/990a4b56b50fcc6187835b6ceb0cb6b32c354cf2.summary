the images of @entity1 celebrating their fourth @entity3 triumph in the @entity4 on sunday evening will live long in the memory			0
sadly , so too will the pictures of @entity7 and @entity8 tearing it up in @entity10 after @entity12 ’s latest tournament humiliation			1
naturally these alarming pictures are amplified by the joyous scenes in @entity15			0
those @entity17 boys are entitled to celebrate			0
what of @entity8 and @entity7 then ? in one image , reminiscent of @entity50 ’s infamous experience in the dentist ’s chair at the @entity52 in @entity53 back in 1996 , a friend pours what looks like champagne down @entity8 ’s throat			1
the two players have been in @entity10 partying with friends before they return to @entity33 and @entity22 for pre-season training			1
it is not becoming of @entity12 internationals			1
in other pictures , @entity8 is holding a cigarette and a cigar in the pool , puffing away without a care in the world			1
his career is threatening to go up in smoke			0
as @entity71 explained after @entity73 ’s stunning 113th - minute winner against @entity74 , this victory has been in production for more than 10 years			2
@entity1 ’s coach stitched it all together			0
pour it out : @entity8 gets a drink tipped by a fellow reveller , with @entity7 passing him a drink by mouth having a chat : @entity33 goalkeeper @entity7 speaks to his @entity12 team - mate in the pool splashing about : the @entity12 goalkeeper looked to be having a great time in the water wet and wild : @entity7 and @entity8 were both part of @entity92 's disappointing @entity12 @entity3 squad relaxed : @entity7 with his girlfriend @entity93 delight : @entity7 appears to be celebrating having fun : @entity7 looked to be having a great time relaxing at the pool party in the @entity99 state of @entity100 going in : the @entity22 midfielder with friends at the party in @entity10 , @entity100 company : @entity8 enjoys himself at the pool party at the @entity43 hotel i 'll drink to that : jack in the pool at the party during his break in @entity99 @entity12 ’s team is falling apart at the seams , underscored by their lamentable performances at this @entity3			1
let us not forget that they were out of this tournament before 12 teams had even played their second group game			0
why could n’t they have kept a low profile now ? the @entity123 continue to maintain that this is all part of a special plan , that this group of players are on the verge of something special			0
no , they are not			0
they are young men , many of whom are ill - disciplined and ill - advised , no better illustrated than by the latest round of party pictures			2
if we are to believe these @entity12 players want success at @entity140 or @entity142 championships as much as they tell us , then they have to change their refuelling habits			1
@entity144 august 2010involved in a fracas outside a @entity147 nightclub , which left a woman with a broken arm			1
@entity8 was arrested and bailed but faced no charges			1
he received a caution for common assault , though a spokesman insisted he acted as peacemaker			0
@entity155 received a police warning for trying to spit on a cab driver wearing a @entity159 hat			0
the midfielder , who was drunk , later apologised			2
@entity161 was warned by @entity162 after tweeting about betting during an @entity164 game			0
@entity162 regulations state players can not bet on games involving their own teams			0
@entity169 july 2011 @entity170 out of a pre-season friendly with a stress fracture on his right ankle			2
february 2012 suffered a second stress fracture to the heel of same foot			0
may 2012 knee injury slowed his rehabilitation and eventually he required surgery , which kept him out for four more months			0
march 2013 @entity182 left ankle saw him miss a @entity164 game and two @entity3 qualifiers			0
may 2013 had surgery to remove a pin in his right ankle and missed two @entity12 ’s friendlies			1
march 2014 @entity189 in his left foot ruled him out for six weeks			0
whisper : a girl speaks in @entity8 's ear as he enjoys his time in @entity197 after the @entity3 disappointment head and shoulders : the @entity12 goalkeeper in the pool at the @entity43 grimacing : @entity8 pulls a face in the bubbling pool in front of two bikini - clad women top - class athletes can not sustain these lifestyles and they should not seek them out either			1
it was only a year ago that @entity12 ’s captain @entity209 claimed @entity8 was a ‘ world - class talent ’ and even went on to say that the @entity22 midfielder could succeed him as skipper			1
with a ball at his feet , no - one doubts that @entity8 is a gifted individual , but boozing it up in bars and smoking like a trooper is no way to fulfil that talent			1
last october , @entity8 , who earns around £ 50,000 a week , assured @entity221 , his manager at @entity22 , that it was a ‘ one off ’ when he was pictured smoking on a night out in @entity147			1
‘ i made a mistake			0
i ’m not a smoker , ’ he told @entity22 ’s official website			1
‘ i spoke to the boss and he asked me what happened			0
i explained it to him and we sorted it out			0
he put me in the team and hopefully i repaid him			2
’ do n’t forget , in the hours that followed @entity22 ’s @entity237 victory , he was caught on camera responding to supporters singing ‘ what do we think of @entity159 ’ by shouting ‘ * * * * ! ’			1
caught : @entity8 was photographed smoking a cigarette outside @entity243 nightclub in october last year no biggie , but @entity8 needs to straighten himself out if he is to go on to have a first - class playing career			1
when @entity22 play their opening fixture against @entity247 in the @entity248 on august 16 , @entity8 will be fighting for his place — and it is getting congested in there			1
@entity252 , a @entity3 winner now , new signing @entity254 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 are all battling it out			0
@entity8 has a big season ahead and this gem of a player is no longer guaranteed a start in a mediocre @entity12 squad			1
it was only a couple of weeks ago that @entity267 striker @entity266 was pictured with his pals in @entity269 , @entity270 , with the receipt for a £ 17,500 , 15 - litre bottle of @entity274 champagne			2
anger : his @entity22 manager @entity221 was furious with the @entity12 midfielder for smoking in october if he wanted it badly enough , @entity266 — who has represented @entity12 at @entity280 , 17 , 19 and 21 levels — would be a full international			1
he has the talent , but not the aptitude			0
at this rate , there is not a chance that he will be considered for the @entity12 squad			1
at the @entity290 and @entity291 charity dinner on may 18 , @entity12 ’s head coach @entity92 allowed his players to have a couple of drinks			2
on one table , @entity209 and @entity295 had half a glass of red wine poured for them and did not touch a drop			0
on another , far more boisterous table , @entity7 drank bottle after bottle of beer at a remarkable rate			2
sitting on the same table was @entity308 , a young man who can not even drive yet , at his first official @entity12 function			2
at the time he was 18			0
what an example to set a kid , trouble brewing ? @entity8 assured @entity221 ( left ) his last smoking episode was a ' one off ' disappointing : @entity8 had a frustrating @entity3 as @entity12 crashed out in the group stage @entity7 ’s boozing was @entity308 ’s introduction to what it means to be part of an @entity12 squad preparing for the @entity3			1
it felt , and looked , like the keeper ’s last big blow - out before the tournament			2
the next day @entity12 ’s first - choice goalkeeper trained with the rest of his team - mates			1
can you imagine @entity329 slugging back a few beers before the @entity3 in the same way with the @entity1 national team ? not on your life			2
@entity329 and his team - mates have committed their lives to being the best they can be			1
and they have made the necessary sacrifices to achieve their ambitions on the field			0
as ever with @entity12 , they are pouring it all away .			2

@entity22 star apologised for smoking near a @entity147 nightclub in october
back then , @entity8 told a furious @entity221 the *incident* was ' one - off '
@entity12 team - mate @entity7 was among the revellers in @entity10
@entity8 was on holiday ahead returning to @entity22 pre-season training
