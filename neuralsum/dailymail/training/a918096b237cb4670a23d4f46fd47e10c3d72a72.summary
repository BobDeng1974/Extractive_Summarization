by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 13:30 est , 14 december 2012 the makers of @entity2 have advanced to @entity3 in @entity4 to launch the first @entity6 city edition of the famous board game			2
instead of @entity9 or @entity2 , players will have the chance to buy @entity11 , a prestigious development where properties in the real world fetch millions			1
the cheapest square - the @entity16 of @entity17 or the @entity2 of the @entity19 version - is a fishing slum on stilts known as @entity21			1
all go in @entity4 : promoter @entity23 holds a @entity3 edition of @entity2 at the launch of the first @entity6 city version of the game hoping for a big number : @entity3 state governor , @entity29 ( centre ) , rolls a dice during the presentation of the @entity3 - themed @entity2 board game the @entity34 , which replaces @entity17 's ' @entity35 : pay £ 100 ' , and @entity36 also feature , while traditional favourites such as the @entity39 cards keep pride of place on the iconic board			1
the ' go to jail ' card has been adapted to say ' go directly to @entity48 jail ' , the city 's maximum - security prison			1
the @entity49 was heavily involved in bringing the game to @entity4 not just to promote the country , but also as a means of educating the public about road safety , it was reported by @entity55			1
many pedestrians are killed in the heavily congested city every year while trying to run across roads			2
@entity59 and poor : @entity11 replaces @entity2 from the @entity19 version , while @entity21 is the @entity3 equivalent to @entity17 's @entity16 @entity62 : the most expensive square on the board was chosen as @entity11 , an artificially created island where only the richest live illustrious : on @entity11 ( pictured ) properties can fetch as much as $ 8million ( £ 4.9million ) poor man 's property : the cheapest square on the board is @entity21 , a fishing slum on stilts @entity19 's @entity2 : @entity21 established itself as a fishing village in the 18th century and now has a population nearing 100,000 one chance card , for example says : ' for using the overhead pedestrian bridge over @entity78 , move forward three spaces '			1
according to the @entity81 another reads : ' you 've been caught driving against traffic			1
' speaking ahead of the launch in @entity86 , @entity87 , the head of @entity89 which is producing the authorised @entity3 edition , told the @entity91 that the choice for the @entity62 spot was a ' hot topic '			0
the eventual winner , @entity11 , has property which would rival that of the prestigious @entity17 district , with some selling for $ 8million ( £ 4.9million )			2
that square and many others have been sponsored by businesses			0
but no - one wanted the cheapest			0
by contrast , @entity21 is a slum neighbourhood built on stilts that was established as a fishing village in the 18th century			2
@entity107 , which owns the rights to @entity2 , said @entity109 would distribute the @entity3 version of the game under an exclusive licence			0
but some feel a stumbling block to the game 's success could lie in the price			0
in the @entity19 and the @entity118 , the game typically costs around $ 18 and £ 10 respectively			0
in @entity4 , however , it will set you back about $ 40 ( £ 24 ) , a hefty sum for the common man there			0
trading places : other squares include the @entity34 , which replaces @entity17 's ' @entity35 tax : pay £ 100 ' and @entity127 instead of @entity128 prime real estate : @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 are among some of the other destinations that feature not just a game : the @entity49 was keen to bring famous game to @entity3 in part to educate the public about road safety , as can been seen with this chance card iconic : the @entity17 version of @entity2 , which was originally developed in @entity142 in the @entity19 in 1933 while @entity3 is the first @entity6 city to get its own version of the game , @entity143 and @entity144 already have their own country - wide edition			1
there is also a @entity152 property game which resembles @entity2 , set in @entity153 , called @entity154 , which means ' to own ' in @entity155			0
@entity2 was developed in the @entity19 , originally based on streets in @entity157 , in 1933			0
a @entity17 version of the game was produced two years later			0
@entity118 version @entity16 @entity161 the @entity162 @entity163 @entity164 @entity165 @entity166 @entity167 @entity168 @entity169 @entity170 the @entity171 @entity172 @entity173 @entity174 @entity175 @entity176 @entity177 @entity178 @entity179 @entity128 @entity9 @entity180 @entity181 @entity182 @entity183 @entity184 water works go to @entity186 @entity19 version @entity2 @entity188 @entity189 @entity190 @entity191 @entity2 @entity2 @entity192 st @entity193 @entity194 @entity2 @entity195 @entity196 @entity2 @entity197 @entity198 @entity199 @entity200 @entity201 @entity202 @entity203 boardwalk @entity205 @entity206 @entity207 @entity208 @entity184 water works go to @entity186 @entity210 @entity21 @entity211 @entity212 @entity213 @entity215 - @entity214 @entity216 @entity217 plaza @entity219 @entity220 @entity221 @entity222 @entity223 @entity132 @entity224 street @entity225 @entity226 @entity227 @entity228 @entity229 @entity230 @entity127 @entity11 @entity231 @entity232 @entity233 @entity36 @entity184 water works go to @entity186			1

@entity9 makes way for @entity11 , @entity21 replaces @entity16
other squares include @entity34 and *notorious* @entity240 jail
@entity49 hopes it will educate public about road safety
one chance card says : ' you 've been caught driving against traffic . report for psychiatric evaluation '
