' there were so many people walking out because they could n’t deal with it			0
' it was vibrating through your whole body - it was actually altering heart rhythms			0
' ms @entity10 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said the noise caused her ear at the @entity37 - which already had a perforated drum - to bleed			1
fellow fan @entity39 , 56 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , said deafening renditions of hits including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 left her in physical pain			1
@entity10 , 54 , left before the reggae band had even finished their first song on monday night at the @entity37 in @entity8 ( pictured ) she said : ' the bass crashed into you like a steam train			1
i had a pain in my chest			0
' @entity57 , 52 , from @entity58 , @entity59 , also left early and said the gig was a ' waste of money ' and gave her a headache			0

@entity70 's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978			0
the original line - up played together for about 30 years - before @entity72 left in january 2008 , claiming management disputes one music fan - who had already had a perforated ear drum ( a hole or tear ) complained of a bleeding ear due to the noise levels at the concert - this is a symptom of the condition			1
this is in itself not dangerous and is nature 's way of relieving pressure from the build up of pus behind the ear drum			1
this in turn relieves the pain of the infection and allows it to get better			0
repeated perforation should however be avoided if possible because each time the ear drum bursts it leaves a small amount of scar tissue as it heals			1
scar tissue is thicker than normal tissue and makes the ear drum less flexible to noise vibration			1
repeated perforations may scar the ear drum leading to reduced hearing in that ear			1
according to the @entity109 , the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise , such as from heavy industry in work places and loud music			0
ways to protect your eats at concerts include : wearing earplugs , standing away from speakers and taking breaks from the room where the noise is playing			0
he said he believed ' the vast majority of people were not affected ' , adding that no - one had complained about the noise to the band ’s sound engineer			0
a @entity37 spokesman said the venue always worked within ' strict health and safety guidelines ' and ear plugs were made available for people on the night			1
he said the responsibility for the concert ’s sound levels lay with promoter @entity137			0
health and safety law at the venue states that the continuous sound level should not exceed 107 @entity142 , with the peak sound pressure level not exceeding 140 @entity142			0
@entity70 's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978 and went on to have 34 top 40 singles and release 18 albums			0
the original line - up played together for about 30 years - before @entity72 left in january 2008 , claiming management disputes			2
@entity149 followed suit and then @entity151 quit in 2013 - the trio have now reformed as @entity3			2
the remaining six members continued to tour and record with @entity72 's brother , @entity155 , on vocals - it was this group which played at the @entity37 on monday night			2
the split has proved to be acrimonious - in february @entity3 released a statement saying : ' anyone going to a concert by the remaining five will be treated to merely a karaoke version of how the band did indeed sound , with a replacement singer who has never recorded a previous @entity3 album and is no part of the @entity3 history			2
' there is only one vocal sound for @entity3 and only two genuine vocalists and it is us			2
