the origins of an enormous rocky moose , which is only clearly visible from the sky , has baffled archaeologists since it was discovered in 2011			1
but now experts say that children from a lost civilisation helped to create the huge antlered artwork 6,000 years ago			1
the moose , which lies close to @entity10 in the southern @entity11 of @entity12 , is the world ’s oldest known geoglyph			1
the moose is only visible from the sky and is the world 's oldest geoglyph it is made from stone and predates @entity27 's famous @entity26 by thousands of years			1
the geoglyph was found in 2011 using satellite images of the area and is older than @entity33 equivalents such as the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 or the @entity37 in @entity38 , archaeologists have confirmed			1
‘ the most interesting development is that tools found at the site indicate it was worked on assiduously by children as well as adults in a large - scale community accomplishment , ’ @entity39 reported			1
stone tools uncovered in recent archaeological digs at the site show that some were made to fit the hands of children who took part in a massive community effort to construct the moose , which stretches for about 902ft ( 275 metres ) and depicts an animal with four legs , antlers and a long muzzle			1
stone tools uncovered in recent archaeological digs at the site ( pictured ) show that some were made to fit the hands of children who took part in a massive community effort to construct the moose , which stretches for about 275 metres and depicts an animal with four legs , antlers and a long muzzle the moose was discovered by chance in 2011 by local researcher @entity70 after he spotted it trawling through satellite images from @entity73			1
originally it would have been visible from a nearby ridge but the growth of trees since ancient times means that it was substantially hidden ( pictured ) what : a large moose design made on the ground from rocks that is visible from a height			1
location : @entity85 in the southern @entity11 mountains , @entity12			1
architects : an unknown ancient civilisation			2
tools indicate that children helped build it			1
length : 902ft ( 275 metres )			0
discovered : in 2011 from satellite images			1
raison d'être : a mystery			2
experts suspect the creation of the geoglyph was linked with worship			2
@entity101 , a senior researcher from the @entity102 , said : ' judging by the different sizes of the tools - from 17cm - long and weighing about three kilograms to some being just two centimetres - we can assume they were used by both adults and children			1
' we can also assume it means that everyone participated in creating the moose			2
' but it was not a kind of slave labour of children			2
they were involved to share common values , to join something important to all the people			0
' some 155 implements have been found near the geoglyph , mostly for digging or breaking stones			1

despite the discovery of small tools , scientists are still puzzled about exactly who built the moose and why			1
the moose , which lies close to @entity10 ( marked on the map ) in the southern @entity11 of @entity12 , is the world ’s oldest known geoglyph the @entity12 moose artwork is the world ’s oldest known geoglyph and is made from stone and predates @entity27 's famous @entity26 by thousands of years			1
giant hands forming part of the lines in the desert are shown some 155 implements have been found near the geoglyph , mostly for digging or breaking stones			1
a shot of the excavation site is pictured no - body knows why ancient people created the geoglyph ( illustrated ) which stretches for about 902 ft ( 275 metres )			1
theories include that it was used to worship gods , denote postcodes , or even attract aliens @entity101 ( pictured ) , a senior researcher from the @entity102 , said : ' judging by the different sizes of the tools - from 17cm - long and weighing about three kilograms to some being just two centimetres - we can assume they were used by both adults and children they assume it was made to impress the gods in ancient times , but local archaeologists have failed to find evidence of ‘ a culture with sufficient refinement ’ which would have been able to construct it between @entity174 and @entity175			1
‘ the figure would initially have looked white and slightly shiny against the green grass background , ’ said dr @entity101			0
researchers hope that they will unearth ceramics at the site , giving them clues as to the identity of the mystery civilisation			0
‘ it may help if we find ceramics on the site			0
ceramics could help us with the date and with understanding who these people were that created the geoglyph , ’ he said			2
‘ it 's not quite clear who the builders were			0
it is obvious that its creation has a big social importance			0
@entity199 are the symbols of unity			0
’ local archaeological digs by the nearby lake found no evidence of a population likely to have built the moose			2
‘ people have lived here since the @entity209 era but there was no sign of large social structures , nor that they did anything other than hunting and fishing , ’ dr @entity101			0
the @entity12 geoglyph was found in 2011 using satellite images and is older than @entity33 geoglyphs such as the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 ( pictured ) or the @entity37 in @entity38 experts assume that the moose marking was made to impress the gods in ancient times , but local archaeologists have failed to find evidence of ‘ a culture with sufficient refinement ’ which would have been able to construct it between @entity174 and @entity175 different sized tools ( pictured ) found near the geoglyph indicate that its creation was a community effort and not a kind of slave labour for children			1
' they were involved to share common values , to join something important to all the people , ' dr @entity101 said			0
‘ so it puzzles me very much			0
it is a kind of mystery : who built this and for what purpose ? ’ the research team found traces of two ancient fireplaces at the site of the moose , both used only once , possibly in a significant ritual , he said			1
‘ the geoglyphs in @entity250 are younger as are those in the @entity33 , though there might be some of comparable age in @entity33 , ’ he added			0
‘ but at the moment @entity253 's is the most ancient , and is the world 's largest figure image			2
‘ by figure image we mean geometrical or zoomorphic figures , because there are very long lines in @entity261 , and here we speak about the figure			0
so it 's not the largest geoglyph , but the largest figure image			2
‘ it could become a tourist attraction and with a museum , but we need to think how it might be implemented			0
" some 50 geoglyphs with various shapes and sizes , including a massive swastika , were recently discovered across northern @entity274			0
some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars , planetary events like sun solstices , or constellations ( illustrated ) a number of theories have been put forward on why ancient man built the geoglyphs			0
geoglyphs are large designs made on the ground from rocks or durable elements of the landscape , such as stones , stone fragments , live trees , gravel , or earth			2
they often form animals and can be most easily seen from the sky , or a high viewpoint			0
worship : they are seen as an early form of statue , used for religious worship			0
this might apply to the @entity306 , in @entity307 , which is thought to date as far back as @entity308 and is the tallest in @entity309			0
some experts say the figure is a representation of an @entity314 war god and the site is considered sacred by @entity316			0
prayer and ritual points : the discovery of fireplaces on the site of the @entity12 moose and other geoglyphs adds to speculation they were used for rituals			1
there is a theory that the @entity250 used to dance along the lines of their geoglyphs when they prayed for rain , with many of the same images featuring on pottery from the time			0
ancient postcodes : @entity199 may have been a way in which civilisations marked their own territories in clear and visible ways			0
more often than they are giant structures in areas that can be seen from a distance or from a high vantage point , leading some experts to say they were used to mark ownership of the land			2
astronomy : some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars , planetary events like sun solstices , or constellations			0
however a 1968 study by the @entity359 found that while some of the @entity250 lines did point to the positions of the @entity364 , it was no more than could be expected by mere chance			0
aliens : a widespread yet bizarre theory sees the markings as signals to visiting aliens			0
some have claimed that the straight lines of @entity250 , for instance , were created as runways for spaceships , but why extra-terrestrials would attempt to land on geoglyphs in the shape of monkeys , spiders , or giant @entity12 moose is another question .			1

giant stone picture of a moose was discovered from satellite images in 2011
now experts say children helped adults construct the rocky structure
this is because of small tools found in the southern @entity11 mountains , @entity12
155 tools were found near the geoglyph , for digging or breaking stones
it 's a mystery why the geoglyph was created around 6,000 years ago
but experts think it was likely to do with impressing ancient gods
