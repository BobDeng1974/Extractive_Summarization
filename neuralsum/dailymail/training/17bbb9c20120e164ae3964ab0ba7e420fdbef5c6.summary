@entity0 looks set to leave @entity6 after failing to break into @entity19 's first - team plans @entity0 , pictured arriving at @entity20 last year , has been cleared of all charges @entity22 , prosecuting , told the court the charges had been withdrawn after @entity0 's defence team recovered @entity27 footage of the first alleged assault outside the one @entity30 nightclub , in @entity31			1
it showed that @entity0 had not hit his ex , as was alleged , and she had ' slumped ' to the floor on her own			2
the ex-girlfriend also withdrew her statement alleging @entity0 later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off and there was ' reluctance ' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her			2
all three charges of assault were withdrawn			0
@entity0 had also been initially accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex and have her shot during a four - year period of harassment			1

when they got back to the house , he is alleged to have assaulted miss @entity8 again , as well as her mother			0
but mr @entity22 said @entity0 's lawyers had got the @entity27 footage from an office building which captured the alleged first assault			1
@entity59 side @entity58 want to sign @entity6 midfielder @entity0 on a pre-contract for the summer he said that , in her statement , miss @entity8 said she remembered her boyfriend standing in front of her and then waking up on the floor with him standing over her			1
mr @entity22 continued : ' when reviewing the @entity27 footage , it 's clear there 's a gap she does n't remember between those two statements			1
' she 's seen falling , or slumping to the ground , remaining there for a minute or two before , quite clearly , the defendant and her friend come to her assistance , trying to get her to stand up			0
' and it is right , thereafter , the @entity62 , the defendant 's car , is seen to come , she 's put , bundled or half - carried into the car and she 's then taken home			0
' it 's quite clear from that cctv footage there 's no assault at that stage			0
' @entity97 have to accept there 's a gap in the evidence and the @entity97 is in the position where they have to reconsider the prospect of a conviction and offer no evidence in respect of count one			0
