dementia is now the leading killer of women , claiming almost 32,000 lives a year dementia is now the leading killer of women – claiming almost 32,000 lives a year			1
official figures show three times as many deaths are caused by dementia and @entity11 ’s as breast cancer , while it is the third biggest killer of men			1
@entity14 rose as a proportion of deaths in women from 11.5 per cent in 2012 to 12.2 per cent in 2013			0
experts believe rising numbers may partly result from better awareness of the disease and willingness of doctors to record it on death certificates			1
the government ’s drive to improve rates of diagnosis and tackle the stigma surrounding dementia may also have boosted the figures			1
coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death in men – accounting for one in six deaths			1
almost 38,000 men died from acute heart conditions including heart attacks last year , while 31,850 women died from dementia			1
cancer is the leading killer of men and women when all subtypes of the disease are combined , accounting for three in 10 deaths , says the data from the @entity50			1
overall , according to the @entity50 , there were 506,790 deaths registered in @entity53 and @entity54 in 2013 , a rise of 1.5 per cent compared with 2012			0
of these , 261,205 were in women and 245,585 in men			0
there has been a dramatic shift in the causes of death since 2003 with heart attacks plummeting as a proportion of the total , down from 22 per cent to 16 per cent in men and from 15 per cent to 10 per cent in women			2
over the same period of time , dementia trebled as a cause of male deaths - up from two per cent to six per cent - and more than doubled in women , up from five per cent to 12 per cent			2
@entity14 overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in women for the first time in 2012			1
experts believe rising numbers may partly result from better awareness of the disease and willingness of doctors to record it on death certificates @entity85 , policy manager at @entity86 , said : ‘ with 225,000 people developing dementia every year and numbers set to soar , dementia is one of the biggest health and social care challenges the @entity93 faces			1
‘ for too long dementia has been wrongly seen by many clinicians as a natural part of ageing and , as such , they have failed to record it as a cause of death			0
‘ increasing awareness of the condition has started to combat this , and these figures are likely to be a product of that			0
’ @entity107 , director of external affairs for @entity108 , said : ‘ age is the biggest risk factor for dementia , and with women living longer than men , we would expect to see this reflected in cause of death			2
sadly , about half a million women in the @entity93 are living with dementia			0
‘ the figures highlight dementia as a huge problem that we can not shy away from any longer			0
dementia and @entity11 's now claim three times as many lives as breast cancer ‘ encouragingly , the statistics reveal that other health conditions , such as heart disease , are beginning to be tamed and this has come about due to improved research into treatment , prevention and better public health			1
‘ we must now turn our attentions to dementia – our greatest health challenge – and invest in research that will drive better prevention and treatment of the condition			0
’ professor @entity139 , medical director at the @entity140 , said : ‘ heart disease continues to blight the lives of thousands of people and families			2
‘ we ’ve made great progress over the last 50 years but we still need to fund much more research to stop people dying needlessly , and to help the increasing number of people living with heart disease			2
’ professor @entity151 , @entity152 ’s chief clinician , said : ‘ @entity153 remains a huge challenge			0
' although we have made great progress against it , it ’s still the highest cause of deaths in @entity53 and @entity54			0
‘ this is partly because people in the @entity93 are living longer – cancer is more common in older people because there is more time for faults in cells to develop – these faults trigger the disease			2
‘ the good news is that thanks to research , survival from cancer has doubled in the last 40 years			0

dementia now claims almost 32,000 lives a year - more than heart disease
dementia and @entity11 's kill three times more women than breast cancer
it 's now the third biggest killer of men , with most dying of heart disease
rising numbers partly due to doctors recording it on death certificates
government 's drive to improve diagnosis rates may have boosted figures
