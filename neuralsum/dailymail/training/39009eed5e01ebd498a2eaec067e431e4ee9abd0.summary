by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 03:52 est , 30 may 2013 a boy aged five was hit by a car travelling at 30mph – and , incredibly , it was the car that came off worse			1
doctors believe @entity5 survived because he has highly - flexible joints which are thought to have helped his body absorb the impact			1
while the car was left dented , @entity5 was able to stand up immediately and walk away with only grazes and a bump to his head despite bouncing off the bonnet and being sent flying			1
' he looked like a rag doll ' : @entity5 , five , was sent flying into the air after being hit by a car outside his home in @entity18 - but escaped unscathed thanks to a condition called hypermobility syndrome relief : @entity5 , pictured with his mother @entity23 , sustained barely a scratch when he was hit by the car on bank holiday monday @entity5 has hypermobility syndrome , which means he is double - jointed			1
the collagen in his skin and ligaments is weaker than normal , making his joints looser and more stretchy so that they can extend further than usual			0
his mother @entity23 , 26 , said : ‘ if that had been an ordinary child there is no way they would have survived			0
‘ the doctors could n’t believe he had been hit by a car and his condition had saved his life			1
he actually left dents in the car , but all he had was a bump on his head and a graze			1
’ @entity5 was crossing the road as his family loaded up their car at their home in @entity50 ready for a day out on bank holiday monday when he was struck			1
his mother watched in horror as he flew into the air off the bonnet before smashing into the ground			2
he was taken to hospital where he was given a clean bill of health and allowed home straight away			0
miss @entity23 said : ‘ the road is very narrow and there are cars parked either side			0
‘ one minute there was nothing coming and the next this car appeared out of nowhere just as @entity5 went to cross			2
‘ he hit the bonnet and got thrown up the road			0
his body looked like a rag doll , but he just jumped up and ran to the pavement			0
the car was doing about 30mph , but he just got right up			2
it was terrible watching it			0
there was nothing i could do to stop it as it all happened so quickly			0
astonishing : the schoolboy , five , was rushed to hospital after being hit by the car - but only sustained a small graze and a bump on his head ‘ it was horrible though , every time i closed my eyes that night i could see it happen in my head			1
’ miss @entity23 , who is now campaigning for speed bumps along the road , added : ‘ someone was watching over him that day , but things could be so much different			0
’ while @entity5 ’s condition means that he can move his limbs into positions that others would find impossible , it can cause fatigue and long - term pain and he receives regular specialist care .			2

@entity5 has *unusually* *supple* joints *due* to hypermobility syndrome

impact left dents in the *bodywork* of the car - but @entity5 was unharmed
