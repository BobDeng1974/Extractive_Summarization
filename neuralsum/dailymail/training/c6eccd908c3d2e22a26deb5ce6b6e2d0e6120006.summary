support : the friends of @entity2 shocking new evidence has emerged that the first privately run @entity5 hospital was the victim of a seriously flawed inspection by the health watchdog , containing more than 200 errors			1
a damning report by the @entity11 last month rated @entity2 , in @entity12 , ‘ inadequate ’ and gave it the lowest ever score for patient care			1
the hospital has now been placed in special measures and @entity17 , the private firm that had been running it , has pulled out of its contract			0
at the time , there were suspicions that the @entity11 ’s rating was influenced by @entity24 activists and trade union members who opposed the involvement of private firms in the @entity5			1
and last night new information came to light showing the report contained at least 215 errors			1
these included inaccurate figures on @entity35 waiting times , staffing levels , cancer care , medical blunders , falls and bedsores			1
all had been overstated or exaggerated and implied that the standards of care and overall performance was far worse than in reality			1
the watchdog claimed there had been 102 ‘ serious ’ blunders by staff last year when actually there were only 42			0
and while the report suggested nurses were routinely sedating patients ‘ inappropriately ’ , the @entity11 has since admitted that only one patient had been given low - dose sedative drugs overnight and this was with the family ’s consent , as he was ‘ distressed ’			1
the watchdog also claimed there were ‘ higher ’ than average levels of bedsores and urinary infections			1
the watchdog has since admitted that actually there is a ‘ low incidence ’ of such cases			0
the evidence is contained in a letter written by @entity17 ’s chief executive , @entity68 , to mps on the @entity70 , who are carrying out their own investigation into the hospital			2
circle claims there were 288 ‘ factual inaccuracies ’ in the report			2
the watchdog has accepted 215 of these , but refused to change its overall rating for the hospital			2
in his letter , mr @entity68 said the @entity11 has refused to provide evidence to back up many of its claims , which included allegations that patients were told to soil themselves or pinched by nurses			2
he also said the report used ‘ inflammatory language ’ , claiming that patients were being treated in an ‘ emotionally abusive manner ’			2
there are concerns that the errors were deliberately inserted by ‘ politically motivated ’ individuals anxious to scupper the private contract			2
last month , it emerged that inspector dr @entity99 was a member of campaign group @entity100			2
a doctor suspected of influencing the report ’s criticism of children ’s services in the @entity35 unit is the @entity24 candidate to be the area ’s mp			1
and the lead inspector , dr @entity109 , was previously a senior member of the @entity110 , the doctors ’ trade union , who had warned of the dangers of privatisation – and he had never carried out an inspection			0
the @entity11 has since changed its policy to ensure inspectors declare links to organisations which may influence their judgement			0
@entity122 , @entity123 mep for the @entity124 , said : ‘ we need an inquiry into this			0
i think it ’s a @entity24 stitch - up			1
’ the hospital will now be placed back in the hands of @entity5 officials			0
a spokesman for the @entity11 said the watchdog ‘ stands by ’ its inspection report			0
the @entity11 has admitted its inspection report contained 215 errors			1
here are some of the most striking : the report claimed @entity2 missed the four - hour @entity35 waiting time target in two weeks out of a 13 - week period , but @entity17 said it was odd to pick this ‘ arbitrary ’ period when the hospital was among the best at hitting the target in the country over the whole year			1
the @entity11 criticised the hospital for not having enough qualified staff in @entity35 to ensure children were looked after safely			0
but staffing levels were within the limits set out by the @entity5 watchdog @entity150 and the @entity152			1
the watchdog stated there had been 102 ‘ @entity156 ’ – blunders by staff – last year when there had only been 42			0
it said the hospital had a ‘ high incidence ’ of patient falls resulting in harm			0
the watchdog now says the number of such falls is below the national average			0
the @entity11 claimed there were higher than average levels of bedsores and urinary infections , which can be a result of neglect			0
it has now admitted that there is a ‘ low incidence ’ of such cases .			0

damning report last month rated @entity178 as ' inadequate '
but there were suspicions the report was influenced by @entity24 activists
new information has revealed the report contained at least 215 errors
these included waiting time figures , staffing levels , falls and cancer care
all these errors showed the figures had been overstated or exaggerated
