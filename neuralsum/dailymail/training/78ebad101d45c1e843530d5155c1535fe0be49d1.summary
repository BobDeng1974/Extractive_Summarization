by @entity0 and @entity1 sunseekers on @entity5 's @entity4 look on as salvage crews begin the mammoth task of refloating the @entity8 - almost half a year after the stricken vessel capsized off the @entity10 coast			1
engineers yesterday moved a salvage rig - the @entity13 - into place next to the luxury cruise liner , which capsized in january , when it struck an 80 - ton rock that lay within a submerged reef			1
the operation to refloat the 114,000 - ton liner and tow her away will take one year to complete in what has been described as an ' unprecedented ' procedure			1
it is expected to cost more than $ 300million ( £ 190million )			2
but it has n't put holidaymakers off visiting the idyllic island			2
as temperatures reached 28 degrees @entity29 today , sunbathers stripped down and swam in the @entity31 - just yards from the salvage operation			1
once upright , it will be towed to a dry dock where it is expected to be scrapped			2
it emerged last week that the massive rock lodged into her side will be removed and turned into a memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives on the ill - fated vessel			1
captain @entity68 is accused of altering the course of the ship so that it sailed close to the picturesque coast in a bid to impress passengers and crew , as well as locals waiting on a nearby island			2
but the liner instead sailed straight into the path of the rock , which tore a 70 - metre hole into the side of the @entity8 's hull before becoming lodged inside the vessel			1
more than 4,000 holidaymakers and crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the ship left port for the start of a @entity93 cruise on january 13			1
at the time , coastguards said they had ' never seen ' anything like it and described the lodged rock as ' unique in maritime history '			2
a cage will be built around the @entity8 and then barges with cranes will be brought in and anchored to the sea bed to help straighten and refloat the massive ship tragedy : more than 4,000 holidaymakers and crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the ship left port on a @entity93 cruise in january long operation : salvage engineers prepare to start work on refloating the @entity8 under house arrest : captain @entity68 is accused of causing the shipwreck , among other charges @entity117 , mayor of @entity4 , confirmed £ 40,000 will be spent to remove the rock as part of the judicial investigation into the tragedy and it will later be turned into a ' fitting ' memorial			1
he said : ' the @entity124 company has said this is what they want to happen and it is also what we want to happen			0
' it will be removed and turned into a memorial of some sorts so that the island can pay tribute to those who lost their lives			0
' we have no idea yet where it will be positioned , but most likely it will be close to the harbour entrance so that visitors and locals can see it clearly and pay their respects to the victims			0
' what happened that night is something @entity4 will never forget and the rock will be a fitting memorial			1
' prosecutors have launched an investigation into mr @entity150 's actions , who is currently under house arrest			0
he has been charged with causing a shipwreck , multiple manslaughter , abandoning ship and failing to inform maritime authorities of the situation			0
it is claimed that mr @entity150 delayed the order to abandon ship for more than an hour			0
this meant that by the time the lifeboats were launched , it was already too late to use them because of the angle of the @entity8			1
many passengers and crew had to make their way down the hull on rope ladders instead			0
witnesses have told prosecutors that mr @entity150 was in a lifeboat when at least 300 people were still on board and needed to be rescued			0
this allegation has led to claims of cowardice against the captain , as he saved himself instead of following the maritime tradition of staying at his post as late as possible			0
the @entity8 lies aground in front of the @entity4 on january 23 , ten days after the disaster unfolded tribute : the massive rock lodged into the side of the ship will be removed and turned into a memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives on the ill - fated vessel people living in @entity4 want the ship removed as quickly as possible and without any lasting environmental impact to the the area			1
the coast is a protected maritime park and boasts a strong population of whales , porpoises and dolphins			0
the island 's beaches are also a popular attraction for thousands of tourists every summer who flock to @entity4			2
earlier this year , salvage teams pumped off 2,380 tonnes of heavy duty diesel that remained in the ship 's fuel tanks , in a round - the - clock operation lasting five weeks			1
mr @entity150 is currently under house arrest at his home in @entity216 , near @entity217			0
his trial is set to resume next month .			0
