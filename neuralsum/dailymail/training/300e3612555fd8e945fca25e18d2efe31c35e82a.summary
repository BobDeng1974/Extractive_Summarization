by @entity0 , associate city editor published : 21:25 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 01:36 est , 24 july 2012 calling for change : professor @entity2 said cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to end the culture of short - term profit in the @entity7 cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to help end the culture of short - term profit in the @entity7 , according to a government - backed review			1
the report also questions whether the directors of large companies should be paid any bonuses at all			1
professor @entity2 , from the @entity17 , said : ‘ many people doing responsible and demanding jobs – cabinet ministers , judges , surgeons , research scientists – do not receive bonuses , and would be insulted by the suggestion that the prospects of bonuses would encourage them to perform their duties more conscientiously			1
’ but he stops short of demanding an end to boardroom bonuses altogether			1
instead , the review recommends all bonuses should be paid in shares that can be cashed in only once an executive has retired			1
the @entity34 report is a key plank of attempts by business secretary @entity37 to overhaul the financial sector			1
mr @entity37 has already unveiled reforms aimed at giving investors more say on excessive rewards			2
the report found ‘ short - termism ’ is strangling growth in the @entity45 economy by starving it of investment as executives seek to bump up their bonuses with quick profits , through risky takeovers or cost - cutting , regardless of the long - term consequences			1
executive bonuses were unusual in the @entity45 until the 1980s , professor @entity34 said , when incentive schemes started to become increasingly common			2
overhaul : the report is a key plank of attempts by business secretary @entity37 to reform the financial sector most bonus schemes encourage chief executives to make decisions that will boost profit in the short - run , even if they have negative effects in the longer term , he added			1
the failed banks @entity68 and @entity69 were ‘ characterised by acute short - termism ’ in the run - up to their collapse and bailout by taxpayers , professor @entity34 said			1
public outrage over multi-million pound banker bonuses soared after a series of scandals scarred the finance sector , including the systems failure at @entity68 , money - laundering at @entity81 and the libor rate - rigging debacle			1
' hanging bankers at the end of the street ' will not help solve the economy ’s problems , @entity83 said last night			2
defending free market principles , the former prime minister warned against increased state intervention and the desire for revenge			0
he insisted public anger should not lead to a reversal of reforms started by @entity97			0
‘ do n’t take 30 years of liberalisation , beginning under @entity97 , and say this is what caused the financial crisis , ’ he said			0
mr @entity83 , who is an adviser to the investment bank @entity103 , said : ‘ we must not go back to the state running everything			0
‘ we must regain the basic values of what society is about			0
we ’re not against wealth , but we are in favour of social responsibility			0
’ mr @entity83 , who stepped down five years ago , is thought to be on an annual income of £ 20million			0
he also has a role with insurer @entity114			0
former @entity117 boss @entity116 , who quit over the libor scandal , was forced to waive his £ 20million golden goodbye			0
however he is still walking away with around £ 2million , on top of a total of around £ 120million he pocketed from the bank since the credit crunch began in 2007			0
unprecedented pay revolts have rocked a number of companies in this year ’s so - called @entity128 , including insurance company @entity129 , media group @entity130 , and drugs firm @entity131			1
‘ it is great @entity2 has raised the question of why executives need any bonus , ’ said @entity132 , of the @entity133			1
‘ they already receive a very generous level of basic pay and they should be making their maximum effort anyway , without needing a further incentive			2
‘ would they really get out of bed two hours later if they did not have the prospect of a bonus ? ’ but professor @entity34 ’s proposals are likely to be met with stiff resistance in boardrooms and the @entity152 has given them a lukewarm reception			0
‘ executive pay should always be linked squarely to good performance over a meaningful period of time , but it is for individual companies to decide their own pay strategy , ’ said @entity155 , director for competitive markets			2
previous attempts to rein in boardroom pay have failed to curb the tide of excess			0
mr @entity37 aims to respond to the review later this year			2
loss : former @entity117 boss @entity116 , who quit over the libor scandal , was forced to waive his £ 20million golden goodbye			0
