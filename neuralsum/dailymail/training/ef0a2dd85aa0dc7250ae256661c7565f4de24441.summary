@entity1 , 23 , had been ordered to carry out the treatment after being convicted of possessing over 600 child abuse images on his computer			2
however , two years into his three - year community order he had still not joined the programme			0
it has now emerged that the urgent treatment was delayed for six months because staff were on sick leave			1
in march 2012 , when @entity1 was due to begin the @entity17 , he attacked a five - year - old girl as she slept and filmed the assault			1
@entity1 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , was arrested three months later when a friend found the vile images			1
he was jailed for two years and eight months in april this year			1
@entity24 and @entity25 , which runs the programme , said today there was no specific requirement as to when the treatment should begin but the delay has been criticised by politicians and the local police commissioner			1
probation workers have revealed the treatment programme was delayed following a @entity36 request			1
it also emerged that five other sex offenders were due to start the delayed programme			2
@entity1 was originally ordered to start treatment after the first offence in march 2011 but a year later he had still not joined because he had been on holiday			2
he was eventually given two start dates in march and october 2012 , but each time the scheme was postponed before being scrapped because of ' insufficient resources '			0
@entity24 and @entity46 runs the programme for convicted sex offenders @entity24 and @entity25 said the only legal requirement for treatment is that the defendant should complete the programme by the end of their sentence			0
but conservative mp for @entity57 , @entity58 , said it was ' highly unsatisfactory '			1
he said : ' i am very surprised and extremely disappointed that this information has come to light			0
' if an offence is serious enough for someone to go on a treatment programme that should be carried out as soon as practically possible after their sentencing			0
' i think in this instance a delay of six months before the course was reconstituted is not acceptable			2
' @entity21 's police and crime commissioner @entity71 said : ' i find this approach quite extraordinary			1
' as far as i am concerned as @entity76 one of the key roles is to look at the accountability and the public interest			0
' while this delay may be within the law i would have thought common sense should have prevailed here and the required course or treatment would have been done straightaway			0
local mp @entity58 said the delay was ' highly unsatisfactory ' ' i do n't understand why the course should have been delayed for six months			1
i find the whole process absolutely ridiculous			1
' @entity1 admitted to offences of sexual touching , taking indecent pictures of a child and downloading indecent images of children at @entity94 in april			2
he also pleaded guilty to breaching a @entity95 and failing to notify police of a change in his address under the terms of the @entity100			0
in addition to being jailed an extended licence period of three years was imposed on @entity103 because of the danger he represented to young girls			0
he was also ordered to sign on the @entity100 and made the subject of an indefinite sexual offences prevention order			0
a probation service investigation into the @entity1 case has now been forwarded on to the @entity112			2
the @entity113 was designed to alter sex offenders ' behaviour by changing their attitudes towards victims and helping them take responsibility for their behaviour			0
it is generally intended for male sexual offenders , aged over 21 , who are sentenced to community orders .			0
