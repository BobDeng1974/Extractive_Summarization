by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 12 june 2012 the @entity2 chief executive said the drop in confidence in the service was disturbing the @entity7 public has fallen out of love with the @entity2 in dramatic fashion , according to a ' social attitudes ' report			1
satisfaction with the way the health service is run fell from 70 per cent in 2010 to 58 per cent in 2011 , the survey published by the @entity13 , found			1
the authors of the report said the drop was the biggest fall in one year since the survey began in 1983			2
the @entity22 which questioned 1,096 people about their views on health care between july and november last year , found that satisfaction with gps dropped slightly from 77 per cent in 2010 to 73 per cent in 2011			2
it also found slight drops in satisfaction with inpatient , outpatient and accident and emergency services			0
however , satisfaction with @entity2 dental services improved by five percentage points - from 51 per cent in 2010 to 56 per cent in 2011			1
@entity13 chief economist @entity37 said : ' the value of this survey is that it has tracked public satisfaction over a long period , providing an important barometer of how the public view the @entity2			1
' the run of year - on - year increases in @entity2 satisfaction had to come to an end at some stage , and it is not surprising this has happened when the @entity2 is facing a well - publicised spending squeeze			1
' nevertheless , it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly			0
this will be a concern to the government , given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its @entity2 reforms			2
' health minister @entity61 said : ' our latest survey of over 70,000 patients shows that an overwhelming majority - 92 % - say that their overall experience of the @entity2 was good , very good or excellent			1
' the @entity22 survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the @entity2 , so responses are influenced by other factors			1
by its nature , it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients			2
' our own polling of the general public , undertaken independently by @entity81 , shows that satisfaction with the @entity2 is broadly stable at around 70 per cent over a similar and more recent time period			1
' health minister @entity61 said their latest survey had shown 92 % patients rated their care as good to excellent @entity2 chief executive @entity88 added : ' these results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the @entity2			1
' it would appear very likely that much of this relates to the understanding and support for the recent reforms			0
' it is really important that politicians and @entity2 leaders are engaging the public in the major debate about the @entity2 and how we need to change in order to sustain and improve the services they have come to expect and value over recent years			1
' any drop in confidence in the service or confusion about the nature of current reform is therefore troubling			0
' over the coming months , it is going to be more important than ever that the @entity57 and the @entity2 communicate effectively the financial and service challenges we face			2
' @entity118 chief executive & general secretary , dr @entity120 , said : ' these findings are disappointing but not surprising			0
over the past couple of years we have seen tens of thousands of posts stripped out of the health service			0
staff are working under huge amounts of stress and pressure			0
' this is a particular issue in accident and emergency settings and sadly we have heard many cases of patients being regularly treated on corridors			0
' the @entity118 has consistently said that the programme of huge reform coming at a time as the service in @entity139 struggles to save Â£ 20 billion will have negative consequences			0
this survey now bears this out and the government will have to sit up and take notice of these findings			0

health minister said survey not accurate *reflection* as targeted general public rather than those who had recently used the @entity2
