@entity1 manager @entity0 feels his former boss @entity2 is capable of managing @entity3 or @entity4 one day			1
@entity5 crosses swords again with @entity2 at the @entity7 on monday night having lost all three of his previous meetings with the @entity10 manager and the @entity12 's stock at @entity13 is rising rapidly again			1
@entity10 have gone 12 games unbeaten in the @entity15 as they close in on a top - four spot which would secure @entity18 qualification for the second successive year after almost ending the club 's 24 - year wait for the title last season			1
@entity0 believes former boss @entity2 is capable of managing @entity3 or @entity4 one day it is a far cry from the autumn when @entity10 were struggling to emerge from the @entity26 era at a time when @entity28 was injured and they lost four successive games in both league and cup			1
but the upturn in their fortunes has led to reports that @entity36 are making admiring glances towards @entity38 and , asked if @entity2 was equipped to manage @entity3 or @entity4 sometime in the future , @entity0 replied : ' yes , he can manage at the top , for sure			1
' he 's got the knowledge , know - how and capabilities in man - management			0
he 's got the package to do it at the elite of @entity47			0
@entity2 admitted earlier this month that he feared the sack at @entity10 prior to changing squad formation ' whether that 's an ambition he has at @entity10 or it is an ambition to be at the really elite i do n't know			2
' but i 'm sure he wants to take @entity10 to those heights again			0
' @entity2 admitted earlier this month that he feared the sack at @entity10 prior to changing the formation to three at the back which sparked their climb up the table			2
but @entity0 , club captain at @entity1 when @entity2 steered the @entity60 club into the @entity15 in 2011 via the @entity62 play - offs , says that would have been a foolish move and applauds his courage to change a system which had proved so successful last season			1
@entity0 knows all about @entity2 ' managerial ways having been club captain during his time at @entity1 ' i 've spoken to him about it and the pressure at the bigger clubs is constant but i think he handles it very well , ' said @entity0 , who remains in regular contact with @entity2			1
' transition 's never easy , especially after a fantastic season , and just missing out on that title will have knocked the confidence of the players initially			0
' it takes time to get that confidence back but he 's done that and he also had quite an influx of players in the summer			0
' all credit to @entity2 for having the bravery to change it to what players probably were n't used to			0
he did it at a period where it could have been a risk but it 's paid dividends			0
' @entity2 shows off the play - off trophy after winning promotion to the @entity15 with @entity1 @entity10 's renaissance has taken them to within two points of fourth - placed @entity95 and @entity5 feels they will improve still further if they qualify for the @entity18 again			1
' i know he was disappointed with the @entity18 this season but if they can push on and get in there again i think they 'll do better next year , ' @entity0 said			0
' he 's evolving as a manager and he 's obviously more confident in his own ability than when he was at @entity1			2
' that comes with going to a big club , being on a big stage and performing there			0
' former @entity1 boss @entity2 is thrown in the air by his players after winning at @entity110			2
