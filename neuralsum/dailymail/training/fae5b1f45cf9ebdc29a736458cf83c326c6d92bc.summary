by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:45 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:28 est , 30 december 2013 reputations count for so much in football and @entity5 will appreciate that when he reads reviews of sunday 's @entity9 v @entity8 game			1
when refereeing appointments are made the tenet ' big names for big games ' is used and the key to these matches is getting the big decisions right			0
at @entity17 failed to make the right call too many times despite being in excellent positions to see incidents clearly			0
man in the middle : @entity5 was in charge of @entity9 against @entity8 but he got a few decisions wrong - like failing to send off @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( sitting down ) when the two @entity28 clashed late on crunch : @entity26 went flying into @entity8 midfielder @entity27 at @entity30 get a grip : @entity27 let @entity26 know he was n't happy with the challenge and grabbed his opponent by the neck the key incidents contact : @entity36 clipped @entity8 striker @entity37 and brought him down in the penalty area going down : @entity37 hit the deck after he was caught by @entity36 during @entity9 's victory over @entity8 ref justice : @entity37 was fuming when @entity5 did not give a penalty for @entity36 's trip on the @entity8 star analysis of these incidents points to a poor performance by @entity49 ’s leading referee but neither manager condemned him which supports @entity52 ’s view of what makes a great man in the middle			1
the @entity56 says that an official has a great reputation if he has earned the right to be regarded as a good referee who has made poor decisions rather than a poor referee			2
that @entity8 boss @entity63 wrongly attacked the referee after @entity8 ’s previous game and @entity9 chief @entity66 won the @entity68 final when @entity5 was in charge will have helped			1
but @entity5 will still not enjoy reviewing the game			0
welcome to @entity9 : @entity36 's high tackle on @entity72 happened early on another one slips through : @entity5 did not send @entity36 off for his nasty challenge on @entity75 midfielder @entity72 we are the halfway point of the season and @entity5 has refereed on 16 of the 19 @entity80 rounds of fixtures , more than any other ref. he is yet to award a penalty or send a player off in the top division despite having plenty of opportunities to do both			1
it could be that @entity91 selection is affecting him and he is perhaps trying to avoid controversy in the build - up to @entity28 2014 - the list of referees for the tournament will be announced in may			2
referees believe that you are remembered for decisions you make and not those you ‘ miss ’			0
that is only true for a limited period , as is a reputation for being a great referee			0
@entity5 now needs to review his approach and prove one last tenet – form is temporary , class is permanent .			2

@entity5 should have sent off @entity36 , @entity27 and @entity26
the ref should also have given @entity8 's @entity37 a penalty
@entity5 hopes to be selected to referee at next *summer* 's @entity91 in @entity28
he has refereed more @entity80 games than any other official this season without showing a red card or giving a penalty
@entity36 should have been **dismissed** for a *shocking* , high , studs - up challenge on @entity72 after just two minutes .
@entity9 should have been awarded a penalty when @entity27 tripped @entity124 – despite @entity124 moving his *leg* towards @entity27 to ensure contact .
when @entity129 *appeared* to climb on @entity37 there were loud penalty appeals and @entity5 was for once not well positioned and waved them away . this time he was right as @entity37 caused the contact by backing in .
@entity8 should have had a penalty when @entity36 *inexplicably* tripped @entity37 .
@entity26 and @entity27 should both have been **dismissed** in the final few minutes when the @entity9 midfielder committed a two - footed *lunging* tackle on his *fellow* @entity28 who *reacted* by grabbing him by the neck . @entity140 , who saw the incident clearly , indicated for play to *continue* with the ‘ *advantage* ’ signal . he was forced to stop play as the *fracas* *escalated* and eventually @entity26 was *cautioned* .
