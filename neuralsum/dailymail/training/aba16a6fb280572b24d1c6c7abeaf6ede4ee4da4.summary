@entity6 , matriarch of the conservative @entity85 stars of @entity7 ’s @entity6 , has an older sister , @entity100 , right , who is a lesbian with a long - term partner but accusations of gay ‘ fear - mongering ’ appeared to threaten the reality show ’s future in november , when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by @entity17			1
in august the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation			0
