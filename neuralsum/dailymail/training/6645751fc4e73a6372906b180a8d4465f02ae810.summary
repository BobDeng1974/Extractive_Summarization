by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the economy is springing back to life and there are ‘ good reasons to suppose a gentle recovery is under way ’ , the governor of the @entity9 said last night			1

@entity15 and @entity13 were bailed out with £ 66billion of taxpayers ’ money during the financial crisis in 2008 but chancellor @entity39 would like to return the banks to the private sector before the election in 2015			1

sir @entity10 told a business audience in @entity50 : ‘ i believe we can roll back the cloud of uncertainty darkening the outlook for demand , allow the rays of optimism to peer through , and sustain a recovery based on a successful rebalancing of the @entity30 economy			1
’ he steered clear of the term ‘ green shoots ’ , notoriously used by the then chancellor @entity62 during the recession in 1991			0
but he said : ‘ there are good reasons to suppose that a gentle recovery is under way			1
’ back to private : sir @entity10 added there is no reason why banks bailed out by the state , such as @entity13 , could not be sold back to the private sector within a short period these , he said , included falling mortgage rates , rising share prices , and companies having a large amount of cash at their disposal to spend on expanding their business			1
there is also more cash swilling around the financial system			0
@entity30 's coveted credit rating was hanging by a thread last night as the country sank deeper into the red			1
official figures showed the government borrowed £ 15.4billion last month , up from £ 14.8billion a year earlier , fuelling fears that @entity30 will be stripped of its gold - plated @entity93 credit rating			2
in further bad news for chancellor @entity39 , figures on friday are expected to show the economy contracted again in the final three months of last year , leaving the country on the brink of a triple - dip recession			2
@entity100 , an economist at banking group @entity101 , said : ‘ the question is how long the @entity30 can hold on to its @entity93 status			2

the upbeat comments from the notoriously pessimistic governor come despite growing fears of a triple - dip recession			2
figures published on friday may show the economy shrank in the final three months of 2012 after the briefest of recoveries between july and september			0
but last night sir @entity10 argued these figures ‘ tell us little about the underlying health of the economy ’ , as they are affected by one - off factors such as the @entity155 and the @entity156			1
he conceded that ‘ living standards have been squeezed for longer than at any time in living memory ’			0
but he said the @entity159 should make it easier for cash - strapped businesses and households to get cheaper loans			0
