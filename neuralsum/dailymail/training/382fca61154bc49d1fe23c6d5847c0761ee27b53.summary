a million women who take @entity2 ’s most popular contraceptive pills are to be told they risk developing potentially fatal bloods clots			1
all gps have been ordered to warn patients that taking some of the bestselling brands of birth control tablets - including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 - means they are nearly twice as likely to suffer blood clots compared to those who use older varieties			1
scientists have found so - called third - generation contraceptives caused 14 deaths a year in @entity17 – and now doctors in the @entity2 have been ordered to alert women to the alarming dangers			1
contraceptive risk : some of the bestselling brands of birth control tablets - including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 - can increase the risk of blood clots @entity4 are warning doctors have also been told not to offer the newer types of pill to those at highest risk			1
@entity2 ’s drugs watchdog has written to the country ’s 60,000 gps telling them they must , for the first time , go through a checklist when prescribing the pills			1
the aim is to ensure they are not given to women with a higher inherent risk of developing blood clots			1
and they have been told they should ‘ carefully consider ’ the risks when prescribing pills			0
the move follows a report by the @entity48 , which found that synthetic hormones used in third generation pills increased the chance of developing life - threatening deep vein thromboses ( @entity53 ) much more than previously thought			1
these newer pills are prescribed about two million times a year			2
they are popular because they are less likely than their predecessors to cause side - effects such as weight gain , headaches , breast tenderness and hair growth			2
but gps have now been told they must fully inform women of the risks of taking different ‘ combined hormonal contraceptives ’ , which contain synthetic versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone			1
the warning has come too late to save teacher @entity75 , who last month died from a clot , her devastated widower has said			0
@entity77 , from @entity78 , added : ‘ the doctors said all women on the pill are at a higher risk of clots , but they said it was incredibly rare			1
' what caused the clot 100 per cent we do n’t know , and i do n’t want to hurt myself by investigating further			2
’ a hospital scan revealed a clot on his 28 - year - old wife ’s brain , but she died within 24 hours of diagnosis			1
dvts , which typically form in the leg , can travel up blood vessels causing a potentially fatal blockage in the lung called a pulmonary embolism			2
they can also go up to the brain , triggering a stroke			0
risk factors include being older and overweight , smoking or being prone to a type of migraine			2
last night pharmaceutical giant @entity107 , which makes @entity8 and @entity108 , said it would be making blood clot warnings more prominent on its packets			2
dr @entity111 , chairman of the @entity112 , said the advice would change the way he would prescribe pills			0
he said : ‘ whereas previously i would have used @entity8 or @entity108 as first line because they ’re more “ lady friendly ” , now i probably would n’t be as keen			0
’ however , he said that he would still offer both to patients			0
the letter from watchdogs at the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) , which went out on january 22 , stated that the risk of developing a serious blood clot from taking any combined pill was still ‘ small ’ and that any woman who had been taking a particular pill without any problems ‘ does not need to stop using it ’			2
the benefits ‘ far outweigh the risk of serious side effects in most women , ’ it went on			2
being pregnant actually increases the risk of @entity53 far more than any pill			0
but the letter warned doctors that ‘ careful consideration ’ should be given to each patient ’s risk of developing @entity53 , as well as the different level of risk each type of pill held			2
doctors should ‘ regularly reassess ’ each woman ’s risk and discuss with them of the potential dangers of the pills they were prescribing			1
similar letters have gone out to doctors across @entity156			0
taking third generation contraceptives increases the risk of clots six times compared to those taking no pills at all			1
the annual risk of a woman of childbearing age having a serious blood clot is 1 in 5,000 if she is not on a combined contraceptive pill , it said			2
the risk triples to about 1 in 1,700 a year if she is taking one of the older forms of combined pill , and taking third generation pills means the risk doubles again , to as high as 1 in 800			1
risk : scientists have found so - called third - generation contraceptives , such as @entity8 caused 14 deaths a year in @entity17 the @entity156 review was prompted by a report from @entity17 , which found that from 2000 to 2011 , 2,529 cases of serious blood clots – just over 200 a year – were down to combined contraceptives			1
of those , 1,751 ( 146 a year ) were due to third generation pills			2
these clots led to 20 deaths a year on average , 14 from newer versions of the pill and six from older versions			1
the @entity17 authorities consequently told doctors to offer the newer pills only if their patients had first tried the old ones – a harder line than the @entity123 has taken			1
doctors are still trying to understand the link between the newer pills and serious blood clots – but it is thought that it is the synthetic oestrogen which increases the risk			1
the hormones which appear to cause raised risks , are : gestodene , desogestrel , drospirenone , etonogestrel and norelgestromin			0
these are present in brands including : @entity211 , @entity9 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity10 , @entity10 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity8 and @entity8			0
older and apparently safer forms of progesterone are : levonorgestrel , norgestimate and norethisterone			0
third generation pills were launched in the 1980s and official concerns were first raised about increased dvt risks in 1995			0
dr @entity225 of the @entity123 said yesterday : ‘ women should continue to take their contraceptive pill			0
these are very safe , highly effective medicines for preventing unintended pregnancy and the benefits associated with their use far outweigh the risk of blood clots			1
’ dr @entity235 of @entity236 , added : ‘ any method of contraception comes with its own benefits and possible side effects , and it ’s important that women are given the information they need to make informed choices			0
’ @entity245 was left partially sighted after suffering a stroke at the age of 17			0
she had been taking the contraceptive pill @entity8 for two years			0
now 19 , she still has limited peripheral vision in both eyes , suffers from headaches and will have to take an aspirin every day for the rest of her life to thin her blood			0
her mother @entity257 said : ‘ after what @entity245 went through , i honestly do n’t think @entity8 and these third - generation pills should still be available			1
' i would warn any parents of teenagers to consider the risks of contraception			0
’ mrs @entity245 , 45 , recalled how former beauty pageant winner @entity245 , right , spent a week in hospital after she collapsed			0
a scan revealed a blood clot in her brain , and doctors linked her stroke to the pill			1
‘ what happened to @entity245 was devastating , ’ said mrs @entity245 from @entity273 , @entity274			0
‘ she dealt with it amazingly but it has changed her			0
