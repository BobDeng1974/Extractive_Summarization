by @entity1 reporter tests show a specific type of cocoa is packed with antioxidants thought to prevent brain disease a nightly cup of cocoa could help stave off @entity10 , scientists claim			1
tests showed that a specific type of cocoa stops clumps of proteins from building up in the brain and damaging nerve cells – causing the disease to progress			1
@entity21 cocoa is full of polyphenols , antioxidants which are also found in fruit and vegetables , with past studies suggesting that they prevent degenerative brain diseases			1
the team also tested the effects of extracts of @entity32 cocoa , but @entity21 , which has the highest levels of polyphenols , was found to be most effective at combatting the build up of harmful proteins			2
the findings are published in the @entity37			0
the study by scientists at @entity40 in @entity41 looked at synapses - the gaps between nerve cells			0
because loss of synaptic function may have a greater role in memory loss than the loss of nerve cells , rescue of synaptic function may serve as a more reliable target for an effective @entity10 drug , said study leader professor @entity54			0
within healthy nerve pathways , each nerve cell sends an electric pulse down which releases chemicals called neurotransmitters that float across the gap and pass on messages			0
however , in brains with degenerative diseases like @entity10 's , groups of harmful proteins attach to each other and can fill in the gaps between nerve cells , disrupting memory circuits and other normal brain functions			2
dr @entity54 , of @entity40 in @entity41 , suggested @entity21 could eventually be made into a dietary supplement to prevent the disease			1
she said : ' we believe our results have broad implications for the prevention of alzheimer 's disease and dementia			0
' each cocoa type was evaluated for its ability to reduce the formation of harmful proteins			0
@entity21 extract , which has the highest polyphenol content and anti-inflammatory activity among the three , was also the most effective in combatting the formation of sticky clumps in the brain and and reversing nerve cell damage			2
he said turning cocoa - based @entity88 into a dietary supplement may provide a safe , inexpensive and easily accessible means to prevent alzheimer 's disease , even in its earliest stages .			1
