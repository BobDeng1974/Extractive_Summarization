@entity0 is expected to plea with the nation to support credit unions as alternative to payday loan companies the @entity0 will today issue an impassioned plea to the nation to support credit unions as an alternative to the payday loan industry			1
@entity0 , who herself uses a local banking co-operative , is expected to tell industry leaders : ‘ credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans			1
‘ they can encourage those who have the means to save and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans			0
‘ the simple fact being that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts , they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them			2
’ a credit union is a regulated co-operative , whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates			1
the @entity35 has more than 520 , boasting more than a million members and managing £ 1billion of assets			1
because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit , credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties			1
this compares with payday lenders such as @entity48 , the country ’s largest , which has charged a staggering 5,853 per cent in annual interest			1
mps , debt campaigners and the archbishop of @entity54 , who is involved in setting up the @entity56 ’s own credit union , have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short - term lenders ‘ legal loan sharks ’			2
as a member of the @entity62 , @entity0 does not want to be seen as passing comment on payday lenders but is instead keen to tell people about the credit union movement			1
a spokesman for the @entity67 said : ‘ @entity68 wants to raise awareness of credit unions , which do not have an established national profile , nor do people understand what they are and what they do			1
' credit unions are regulated financial institutions			1
they are based within the community and are not for profit			0
as a member of the @entity62 , @entity0 does not want to pass comment on payday lenders but is raising awareness of credit unions			1
pictured on memorial pitch at the former school of her late brother , @entity84 mps , debt campaigners and the archbishop of @entity54 , who is involved in setting up the @entity56 ’s own credit union , have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short - term lenders ‘ legal loan sharks ’ ‘ @entity90 believes credit unions do a valuable job in their local communities and wants more people to know about them			1
' she felt that @entity96 was a good time to raise awareness about the good work they do			0
’ indeed , @entity0 has put her money where her mouth is			0
in january 2013 she opened up a personal savings account with the @entity104			0
it is understood the royal was ‘ inspired ’ by the work the mutual does			0
it is believed she uses her savings account to support local community projects			2
@entity68 has drawn together at @entity112 a high - profile gathering of representatives from business , banking and politics , as well as credit union members and volunteers , to mark @entity96			2
in particular , the group wants to find ways to encourage more savers to get involved			0
although some of the small credit unions are not able to offer a return on investments , many offer interest or dividends of up to 1.75 per cent , which is healthy compared to the high street			1
@entity131 ceo of @entity132 in @entity133 said : ‘ this is about people coming together and pooling their savings together			0
from that pool of savings we are able to lend to each other			0
‘ we are not a poor persons ’ bank			0
we just need everybody in the community to become involved			0
joining a credit union gives you a good deal but helps people as well			2
’ payday lenders such as @entity48 have been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who can not afford to pay it back , further spiralling them into debt			1
the firm ’s reputation was damaged further this summer when it was revealed to have been charging customers for letters from fake legal firms to pressurise them into paying up			0
earlier this month @entity48 agreed to write off the debts – thought to total £ 220million – of 330,000 customers who are in arrears of 30 days or more			2
this was a direct consequence of discussions with watchdogs at the @entity167			0
chief executive of @entity169 , @entity170 , said : ‘ payday lenders have engaged in poisonous practices for years			1
‘ the payday loan market has pushed people into debt by repeatedly concealing the true cost of loans and failing to check if borrowers can repay			2
' in only a quarter of the payday loan cases reported to us did the borrower think their payday lender had treated them sympathetically			0
’ @entity48 has been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who can not afford to pay it back , which leaves them spiralling into more debt			2
earlier this month the company had to write of £ 220million in debts			0
