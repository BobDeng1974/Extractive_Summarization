ever been told by a new neighbour ‘ you must come for dinner ’ then spent weeks waiting for a follow - up invitation that never arrives ? or been thrilled when the boss said he ’d bear your ‘ very interesting ’ idea in mind and been surprised when it was never mentioned again			2
then you ’ve been victim of the uniquely @entity8 trait of being too prim and polite to say what we really mean			1
and if it can be baffling for us , imagine what it must be like for foreigners who take our every word at face value			2
now there ’s help in the form of a translation table which has become a huge hit on the internet			1
it reveals that when a @entity8 person begins a sentence ‘ with the greatest respect ... ’ , they ’re really saying ‘ i think you are an idiot			1
’ ‘ i hear what you say ’ means ‘ i disagree and do not want to discuss it further ’ while ‘ that is a very brave proposal ’ translates as ‘ you are insane ’			2
the table , which has been posted on numerous internet blogs , has received thousands of comments acknowledging that it ’s spot on – from foreigners and @entity8 alike			1
@entity39 - based @entity38 who writes a blog called a cup of @entity42 , says her @entity44 father often left her baffled			2
‘ when we were in high school , my sister asked him if she could drive to @entity48 with her boyfriend to see a band			0
he said , “ i ’d rather you not			0
when he got mad later , she was confused : “ but you never said i could n’t go ”			0
’ the author of the table is a mystery , although some say it was drawn up a few years ago by a @entity59 firm as a light - hearted help for executives working in the @entity8			1
it has since been added to			0
lost in the post ? the table demonstrates that it is common for a @entity8 person to say ' you must come for dinner ' out of politeness but not make a real offer one of the first people to post it was @entity73 , a strategic adviser for @entity74 , who described it as ‘ a handy guide for our fellow @entity77 and others trying to fathom weaselly @entity80 - speak ’			1
mr @entity73 said : ‘ sadly , i did n’t write it			0
it ’s just one of those great things that is being passed around on the internet			1
’ internet posters have been busy coming up with their own translations			1
@entity88 wrote that ‘ leave it with me ’ means ‘ @entity90 will freeze over before you see a solution to this problem ’			0
another said ‘ when you get a minute ’ means ‘ do this immediately ’ while a third says ‘ let ’s keep in touch ’ tends to mean ‘ i never want to see or hear from you again ’			0

spoof translation table *deciphering* the truth behind @entity8 *niceties* is an internet hit
said phrases like ' quite good ' really mean ' i *'m* *disappointed* ' and ' that *'s* not *bad* ' is a form of *praise*
split into *sections* describing ' what the @entity8 say ' , ' what the @entity8 mean ' and ' what others understand '
