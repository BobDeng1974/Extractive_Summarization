by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 15 march 2013 traditional treat : brits are losing their appetite for flapjacks it was once a popular teatime treat but now the @entity7 flapjack is dying out in favour of cereal bars and @entity11 - style muffins and cupcakes			1
new industry figures show @entity7 sales of flapjacks slumped by 23 per cent between 2011 and last year			1
the fall comes despite the @entity18 - inspired baking boom that has helped buoy sales of rival products from @entity22 sponges to individually wrapped cake slices and bars			2
and while flapjack sales flop , those of muffins have almost doubled over the same period , said market analysts @entity25			1
flapjacks are one of the oldest and most traditional of @entity7 favourites , even getting a mention in @entity35 's play , @entity36 , where it is referred to as an after dinner treat			1
' come , thou shalt go home , and we 'll have flesh for holidays , fish for fasting - days , and moreo'er puddings and flap - jacks , and thou shalt be welcome , ' the @entity35 wrote			0
but @entity7 are losing their taste for it , even though other similar products are selling , quite literally , like hot cakes fuelled partly by the popularity of @entity52 's great @entity7 bake - off			1
according to @entity25 , overall sales of off the shelf ( rather than home cooked or sold in a cafe or coffee shop ) cakes went up 11 per cent from 219 million kg in 2011 to 244 million kg last year			1
in terms of value , the rise was just two per cent , to Â£ 847 million			0
but this is partly due to a fall in previously record prices for commodities like grain which has reduced retail prices			0
@entity18 effect : cakes sales are booming thanks in part to the @entity72 the biggest increase was a 99 per cent volume sales rise for shop bought muffins , up from 20 million kg sold in 2011 to 39 million last year , said @entity25			1
individual cake slices , such as those sold by brands including mr @entity80 , saw a 21 per cent volume rise from 29 million kg to 35 million kg in the same period			1
there was also a 20 per cent rise for cake bars , like those made by brands including @entity87 's , as volume sales increases from 10 million kg to 12 million kg. sweet temptation : cupcakes and muffins are profiting from being fashionable tea break snacks whole cakes and small , individual cakes such as cupcakes both saw rises , as did old fashioned malt loafs			1
@entity98 rolls and tart sales were static			0
@entity25 said flapjacks floundering because they lack big brand support and ' sit awkwardly ' between being a wholesome product made from oats yet are also unhealthy because they 're high in fat			0
a spokesman said : ' devoid of big brand support and encumbered with a recipe that sits awkwardly between wholesomeness and indulgence - and yet is outstanding in neither - flapjacks appear to be floundering in a middle ground			0
' after all , you have to go back to the @entity35 himself for their last notable marketing moment			0
' cereal bars have prospered as an energy - rich alternative to flapjacks and some other forms of individually wrapped cakes , said @entity25			0
and cupcakes and muffins were profiting from being fashionable tea break treats , which flapjacks were not			2
@entity25 added : ' in the 12 months to january 2013 , volume sales of flapjacks nosedived			2
this is particularly dismal considering the total cake category enjoyed an 11 per cent market jump in the same period			2
' it 's likely that flapjacks have been hit by the rise in prominence of cereal bars			0
many of them too have a basic composition of oats or other grains , honey and occasional fruit , similar to flapjacks , yet have clearer associations with healthiness , wholesomeness and on - the - go snacking			0
