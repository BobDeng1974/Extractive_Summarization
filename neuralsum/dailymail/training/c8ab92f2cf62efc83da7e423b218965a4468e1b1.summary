as the relentless disease ravaged her body , her left leg , right foot and both hands were amputated , and doctors were also forced to remove part of her torso			1
now , a day after doctors upgraded her condition from serious to good , @entity10 has ventured outside for the first time - 49 days after she was first admitted to hospital			1
the image shows her grinning outside the hospital with her parents ' the look on @entity10 's face was just incredible , ' her father , @entity35 , told @entity38			1
' she could smell the pine trees and feel the breeze through her hair and just the sun on her skin			2

' while there , they took a photograph of @entity10 grinning with her hair pulled into a side pony tail , with her parents smiling either side of her			1
bandages cover the ends of her arms			2
' @entity10 has a beauty in this photograph that i think goes beyond words , ' @entity35 said			1
' it 's a beauty of survival , of resilience			2
' proud : her father , @entity35 , holds up the photo during an interview with @entity38 @entity35 , who has been keeping a blog about his daughter 's condition , posted online to describe the moment the sun fell on her skin again for the first time in nearly two months			1
he wrote that , once the family was outside , they reflected on the life - changing events - and @entity10 showed breathtaking courage			1
' i do n’t have any regrets about what has happened , ' @entity10 told her father			1
' i do n’t focus on what i ’ve lost , i would rather focus on what i ’ve gained			2
i feel like i ’ve been blessed			2
' she went on : ' i am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience			0

i ’m blessed to be different			0
' speaking to @entity38 , her father spoke of her determination to walk at her master 's graduation ceremony this december			1
' you heard the word right , ' he said			0

' earlier this month , mr @entity35 said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal			0
her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication			0
the student had originally indicated that she felt a ' traitor to her convictions ' by using drugs to manage her pain , because she believed in holistic medicine			0
injuries : @entity10 had her left leg , right foot and both hands amputated			1
she also lost part of her torso much - loved : @entity10 's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery ( from left - @entity10 , mother @entity130 , father @entity35 and sister @entity135 ) she also suffered phantom pains			1

' the @entity148 student had to have her left leg amputated at the hip , her right foot and both hands in order to save her life after a cut to her leg became infected			1
the bacteria that attacked miss @entity10 's wound released a toxin that destroys skin , muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia , her father said			1

' this doctor ca n't fathom a reason for why she 's improved the way she has , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' her spirits are extraordinarily high			0
' necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			0
' @entity196 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			1
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			2
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			2
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons			0
there are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year , but 20 to 25 percent of victims die			0
