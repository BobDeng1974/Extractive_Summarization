when it comes to criss - crossing the globe by plane , it seems jet lag is the least of our worries			0
whether you 're suffering from dehydration due to low cabin humidity or suffering from pain in your ear canal during takeoff and landing , everything from oxygen deprivation to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell in the air			1
here are some of the scariest health effects of flying ... and some suggestions to prevent and combat them			1
everything from dehydration to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell while in the air dehydration while bodies are most comfortable at around 50 percent humidity , an aeroplane 's cabin humidity can be as low as 10 per cent			1
that is drier than being in a desert			0
naturally , this extreme dryness will only lead to only one inevitable conclusion : a very dehydrated traveller			0
according to @entity38 , the symptoms of dehydration include ' dizziness or light - headedness , headache , tiredness , dry mouth , lips and eyes , and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently			1
' dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses , nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection			1
combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties , like alcohol or coffee			1
low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages , like alcohol , to a minimum ear pain ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing ? it turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal			1
but it 's only when this pressure can not be released , such as due to blockage from a cold , for example , that the passenger will really be made aware of the change			2
luckily , alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing , chewing or yawning			0
additionally , the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears , when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence			0
ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure in this instance , the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings , which is the steadiest part of the plane			1
and the final ear - related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing			0
whether watching a movie or listening to your @entity117 , the sounds you 're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc , since it 's a different listening environment than you 're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out			0
although your hearing wo n't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two , frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long - term effects			0
lower levels of oxygen in the plane 's pressurised air can cause light - headedness and shallow breathing oxygen deprivation it may be a small difference , but the lower oxygen levels in the plane 's pressurised air can lead to minor oxygen deprivation in travellers			2
this could cause light - headedness , shallow breathing or difficulty concentrating			0
if this happens to you , be sure to alert a flight attendant , as he or she may be able to provide you with additional oxygen or even increase the overall airflow to the plane			2
the lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation , which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you 're cramped in your seat			1
ideally , walk around the aircraft every 30 minutes , or , at the very least , flex and stretch your feet regularly			0
deep vein thrombosis ( @entity164 ) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity @entity164 deep vein thrombosis ( or @entity164 ) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs , causing pain and swelling			1
occasionally , it may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism , which is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs			0
anyone sitting for more than four hours , as most people do during long - haul flights , is at risk of developing @entity164 , however , certain groups may be at greater risk			0
@entity187 encourages anyone aged 40 or over , anyone with a family history of blood clothes or anyone being treated for cancer , heart failure or circulation problems to be especially cautious			0
to help prevent clots , moving around during the flight and wearing support stockings will both help to keep blood circulating			2
however , if you begin to feel short of breath , experience chest pain , or if your legs are still swollen after the flight , you should seek medical attention immediately			2
on long - haul flights , your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays , energetic particles from space , is higher radiation exposure while on international flights , you 're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays , which are energetic particles from space , mostly made up of protons			1
the longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the @entity219 , the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience			1
while it 's of most concern for those who fly for a living , frequent flier passengers will experience more of this exposure than people who spend more time on the ground			0
several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population , although a recent @entity236 ( @entity236 ) report did not find further support of such a claim			1
however , the @entity236 does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you can not see or feel it , often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed			1
flying roundtrip from @entity244 to @entity245 , for example , three times per year , would expose passengers to the equivalent of 3 chest x-rays , or about 100 @entity251			2
on a roundtrip flight from @entity244 to @entity254 , however , you can easily exceed that amount			2
@entity257 damage from uv rays it is not something passengers would necessarily think to do before a flight , but applying suncream could well protect against uv damage in the skies			2
' at high altitude , over 54 per cent of @entity270 rays penetrate glass , making pilots spending long periods in the cockpit up to twice as likely to develop melanoma , ' @entity266 , @entity267 at @entity268 tells @entity277			0
' in fact , 56.6 minutes in the air is equivalent to 20 minutes on a tanning bed			2
' when flying , a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane common cold finally , and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers , those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold			1
a 2004 study in the @entity293 found that when you 're flying , your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you 're not on a plane			1
take proper precautions and be sure to wash your hands frequently , and carry anti-bacterial hand sanitiser , when globe trotting			0
after all , the last thing you want is for a simple cold to slow you down on your next glamorous getaway .			0

when it comes to flying , there are plenty of health concerns to look out for
due to the lack of cabin air humidity , dehydration and swelling are common
cosmic radiation is also higher when in flight and closer to the @entity219
