for obvious reasons , the chances of one sport completing a clean sweep of the main prizes at the @entity5 awards are slim indeed			2
but , as the panel comprising sports stars , sports editors and @entity5 bigwigs prepares to convene to set the ball rolling ahead of the big announcements on december 14 , let ’s put the case for golf breaking the mould and completing this particular triple crown			2
let ’s start with @entity19			2
did anyone put in a performance that came close to @entity23 ’s steamrollering of the @entity24 in the @entity25 at @entity26 in september ? @entity23 captain @entity27 celebrates victory in the @entity25 it ’s not easy dealing with great expectation			1
just ask @entity32 ’s footballers			2
but @entity23 ’s team delivered to a man to trigger a post-mortem in @entity24 that still rages			1
you can understand their angst			2
how does a nation with such a strong college golf system and the most glamorous tour in the world keep losing ? but does n’t that underline the scale of @entity23 ’s achievement ? for @entity45 , it surely has to be @entity27			1
for two years , the @entity46 poured everything he had into the role of @entity23 ’s captain			1
never mind not leaving any stones unturned ; @entity27 never left any grains of sand unturned			1
regarding that heavy burden of expectation , what an inspired move it was to seek the counsel of sir @entity58 , the man who dealt so brilliantly with it all his working life			0
@entity23 steamrollered the @entity24 in the @entity25 that was just one of many moves which made @entity27 the best @entity25 captain since @entity66			1
and so to the main award itself , the one decided on the night by the viewers			1
since it began in 1954 , only two golfers have won it — @entity74 , for captaining @entity75 and @entity76 to victory in the @entity25 in 1957 and sir @entity78 for winning his first masters in 1989			1
a quarter - century on , the case for a third is so overwhelming it would , quite frankly , damage the credibility of the award if @entity83 did n’t win it			1
@entity84 is his only conceivable rival and , no doubt , the motor racing fraternity will lobby as powerfully as ever			0
but let ’s be honest			0
if @entity84 was in any other car but a @entity90 he would n’t be close to claiming @entity93 ’s main prize			1
he ’s effectively winning a two - car race			0
@entity83 has put together the greatest season in the history of @entity23 golf			1
@entity83 has put together the greatest season in the history of @entity23 golf			1
even @entity78 ’s best season did n’t come close			2
the @entity99 did n’t just win two majors , he won the @entity102 ’s flagship event plus one of the four @entity104 events that sit one rung below the majors			0
there was also a singles display at the @entity25 so good it had some of the nation ’s leading sportswriters comparing him to other superstars who transcend their game , like @entity114 and @entity115			1
a clean sweep for one sport ? admittedly , it is asking an awful lot			0
but then this was the year our golfers delivered an awful lot			0
a rare duff shot by @entity125 given how good it has been to see him play with a smile on his face again this year , it is with a heavy heart that i take @entity125 to task			0
but the fact is , he let @entity23 golf down badly last week			1
the first event of the four - tournament @entity137 to conclude the season sees lots of money at stake in @entity143 courtesy of loyal sponsor @entity144			2
@entity125 sent out wrong message by snubbing @entity143 for @entity146 @entity125 has a golden chance to close the gap on @entity83 , the man leading the race to @entity150 , who has been detained in @entity76 by his lawyers			1
so what does @entity125 do ? the @entity153 decides to play in the @entity155 event in @entity146 instead			0
yes , i ’m sure the appearance money was good			0
but did he not stop for a minute to think what sort of message this sends out ? how are the rest of us supposed to get interested in the @entity137 concept if the no 2 ca n’t be bothered to show up ? just to complete @entity144 ’s week , the tournament was won by @entity167 — sponsored by @entity90			0
on the @entity102 website , full marks for creativity to the photographer who got @entity167 to hold the trophy at just the right angle to block out the massive @entity90 logo on the @entity175 ’s shirt			0
quote of the week ‘ for some weird reason , i had this gut feeling i may make another one			0
when i saw the ball land and kick towards the hole , i thought , “ wow , this is actually going to happen ”			0
’ one week after winning a £ 40,000 @entity184 for a hole in one in @entity186 , @entity188 player @entity187 ( above ) travelled to @entity189 , where she won a £ 40,000 @entity191 following another ace			0
in case you were wondering , the odds on that happening on designated holes in successive tournaments have been calculated at over 500,000 - 1 .			0

@entity23 must scoop team award for *crushing* @entity24 in the @entity25
for @entity45 , it surely has to be @entity27
main prize must go to @entity83 after *fantastic* season
