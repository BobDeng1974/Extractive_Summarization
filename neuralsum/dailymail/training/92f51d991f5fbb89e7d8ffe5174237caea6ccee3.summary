a 4 - 0 defeat to @entity1 is certainly not the way to introduce yourself to the @entity7 faithful - or to force your way into @entity6 's first team plans			1
@entity7 and @entity8 succumbed to a humiliating hammering at the hands of the @entity1 at @entity11 thanks to braces from @entity13 and @entity14 , on loan from @entity16			1
despite some impressive first half displays from @entity7 's youngsters , in the second period they appeared to crumble as @entity1 continued to grow stronger as the game progressed			1
here , @entity21 gives you the lowdown on how @entity7 's youngsters fared			1
he is big , athletic and strong and he loves to attack			2
his presence on the field has quickly elevated him into @entity8 's thinking and he has a chance of being on the fringes of the @entity50 's first - team squad this season			1
how did he play ? @entity34 made his debut at right wing - back against @entity1			1
he was very strong and physical throughout and has shown he will not be bullied			0
however , he did give away two fouls in dangerous positions			0
the 18 - year - old also got forward reasonably well but wasted a good chance to cross the ball just before half - time when @entity60 played him clear down the right - wing			1
replaced at half - time , he was slightly unfortunate to be sacrificed so early			2
strong : @entity34 looked extremely powerful and strong before being replaced at half - time by @entity6 @entity64 age : 22 position : right - back profile : the @entity67 had not started for @entity7 in two years before the @entity1 match and he began the game in the unusual position as one of a back three			1
he made his debut in september 2012 in a @entity75 tie with @entity76 before being loaned to @entity50 side @entity77 , where he gained valuable experience as their first - choice right - back			2
@entity64 is extremely versatile and can play anywhere across the back four , meaning @entity8 could utilise his versatility this season in his 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
the 22 - year - old loves to get forward and will not be shy at attacking if he was to be used in a wider position			0
unconvincing : @entity64 is challenged by @entity14 in his first @entity7 appearance for two years how did he play ? two years after his last appearance and @entity64 was not wholly convincing at left centre - back			1
he was caught out with the ball in behind a couple of times and did not seem comfortable in a back three			0
@entity64 did make a couple of important defensive clearances in the first half , but unable to get across to cover @entity13 for @entity1 ' second goal			1
@entity99 misjudged the bounce of the ball for @entity103 's second and allowed the @entity16 loanee in behind to score			0
@entity105 age : 21 position : centre - back profile : @entity105 made his @entity110 debut off the bench against @entity112 last weekend and slotted in fairly well into the back three at the @entity113			1
he is the brother of @entity114 , the striker , and has been on loan to @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 in his career so far			0
the 21 - year - old was extremely highly regarded at @entity118 and featured prominently for them in the @entity121			0
he has scored three goals in 12 appearances for the @entity124 and has been touted as a future full international			0
how did he play ? @entity105 made his second appearance in a row as he started at right centre - back			1
to use an old and awful cliche , it was a game of two halves for @entity105			1
he looked the most composed of the centre - halves in the opening 45 minutes , distributing the ball well and calming situations down			0
but then in the second half he just seemed to wilt under @entity1 ' pressure			1
nowhere to be seen for @entity13 's second goal - in a position he should have been covering - and regularly troubled as @entity7 tried to push as many bodies forward as possible			1
competitive : @entity105 looked composed at centre - back and willing to challenge both in the air and ground @entity145 age : 20 position : left - back profile : the career of @entity145 has been an interesting one			1
the left - back was released by @entity152 as an 18 - year - old two years ago but he was handed a lifeline by @entity7 's reserve - team manager @entity155			1
he made more appearances for @entity7 's second - string last season than any other player			2
after being invited by @entity8 to appear on the pre-season tour of the @entity160 , @entity145 scored twice against @entity161 and impressed against @entity162 - bombing forward on every possible occasion			1
he looks an exciting talent and , in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation , he could flourish at left wing - back			0
how did he play ? started at left wing - back			2
always willing to get forward at every opportunity and offer himself as another striker			0
sometimes a bit sloppy on the ball			0
ran back towards his defence a couple of times , inviting pressure			0
booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge where he dived in , seemingly from frustration			0
gave the ball away lazily to @entity103 for the third goal and that sort of blotted an otherwise half - decent copybook for the night			2
just as he showed on @entity7 's pre-season tour to the @entity160 , @entity145 is willing to bomb forward at every opportunity and from an attacking point of view he looks a perfect fit at wing - back			1
unfortunately defensively he can have lapses of concentration and he put his side needlessly under pressure a couple of times			0
he was booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge as well			0
attacking : @entity145 tried to get forward at every possible opportunity for @entity7 on tuesday possession : @entity145 was willing to attack but also compete for the ball from his left wing - back position @entity200 age : 18 position : attacking - midfielder profile : as opposed to the other five youngsters who tend to be defensively - minded , @entity200 is an attacking option for @entity8			1
he can operate anywhere in midfield but is more adept in an attacking capacity			0
the @entity67 - born @entity209 can operate as a no 8 or as a @entity211 and he loves to take a set piece , regularly scoring for the younger - age groups			0
the 18 - year - old was signed from @entity216 youth and is extremely highly thought of at @entity7			2
with the arrival of @entity218 he may struggle for opportunities , but he certainly gives his manager an option to take into consideration			0
how did he play ? came on after 46 minutes for @entity34			2
looks very nice on the ball			0
took a free - kick from the left - hand side of the box which just dipped over the bar , highlighting his confidence			0
lovely flowing running and set up @entity231 for an effort just before the hour mark			0
@entity234 : attacking midfielder @entity200 showed signs of creativity despite joining a sinking ship on the pitch sinking ship : @entity200 entered the fray with @entity7 already behind and could not turn around his side 's fortunes @entity243 age : 19 position : centre - back / midfielder profile : @entity243 arrived at @entity7 in 2011 as a midfielder but quickly adapted to being able to competently play at centre - back as well			1
the @entity250 himself does not believe he will know his own best position for a couple of years due to his own versatility			0
he is highly rated and is not afraid to put his foot in - he is not immune to a booking - and would give @entity8 some much - needed bite in midfield , something united seriously lack right now			2
how did he play ? made the bench but did not get on to the pitch			2
yet to get his chance : @entity262 youngster @entity243 ( right ) was on the bench but did not get on			2

braces from @entity13 and @entity14 help @entity1 to *famous* victory
@entity7 humbled in @entity75 second round
@entity6 still yet to win a competitive game since taking over as boss
@entity8 played a team mixed with fringe players and youngsters
@entity34 , @entity64 , @entity145 and @entity105 all started
midfielder @entity200 also appeared off the bench for @entity7
youngsters played well first half but wilted as @entity1 took control
