a @entity1 missile managed to punch a hole all the way through a moving ship , paving the way for the @entity6 to improve its use of long range weapons on moving targets			1
a test of the explosive off @entity11 in @entity12 showed the missile ploughing through a shipping container attached to a moving ship with such force that it punched a hole and emerged on the other side to bounce along the surface of the water			1
if the @entity6 can perfect the technique to launch the missile this could give an almost 1,000 nautical mile extension to its fleet of guided destroyers and solve a current problem with a lack of long range anti-surface missiles , @entity22 reported			1
the @entity1 – unlike earlier versions of the missile – has the ability to adjust its flight path based on new information given to the missile allowing it to hit moving targets			2
unclassfied video footage of a @entity62 missile test in january was obtained by @entity22 news			0
it shows the explosive being launched from a guided missile destroyer @entity67			0
the missile is fired powerfully into the air in a plume of smoke and travels considerable distance before it is seen punching through a container			0
in an unclassified video the missile is shown heading for the red metal shipping container as it moves the powerful explosive punched a hole all the way through the large shipping container during the test the explosive then emerges out of the other side and bounces along the surface of the ocean			2
a previous tomahawk missile with a 200 nautical mile range was previously developed by the @entity6 in the 1980s , but there was a lack of technology to control it or ensure it hit the correct target			0
due to its limited success and the danger of hitting friendly or neutral ships , the missiles were developed into land attack tomahawks			0
@entity99 footage shows the missile being fired , at long range , from @entity67 , in the middle of the ocean as the missile tears through the air it hones in on the metal shipping container out at sea it is hoped the successful test could pave the way for missiles to be used to boost the @entity115 navy 's fleet the missile is shown hitting its target successfully and punching through the metal with explosive force a large hole was punched all the way through the container , showing the path of the @entity1 missile			1

video has emerged of a @entity1 missile being fired at a moving ship
the missile is fired from a ship off the @entity12 coast at long range
it hits with such power it punches a hole through the metal container
success of the test means the @entity6 could be able to use the @entity1 missile in *future* to improve use of long range weapons on moving targets
