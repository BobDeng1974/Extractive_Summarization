when @entity1 crashed out of the last global limited - overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the @entity5 to complete what had been a hugely disappointing @entity7			2
fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match , this time against @entity12 , where @entity1 have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match			1
@entity14 will not need reminding that a dispirited @entity1 lost to @entity5 in @entity15 and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage			1
@entity22 talks to his players before an @entity1 nets session at the @entity25 on wednesday @entity22 ( centre ) chats with captain @entity27 as @entity1 prepare for their final @entity29 match indications are @entity22 will keep his job , at least for the @entity32 in the @entity33 , whatever happens at the @entity25 on friday but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘ minnows			1
’ the fact @entity1 turned up early on wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something , anything , from their worst ever @entity29			1
@entity1 are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an @entity53 nation who can not believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their @entity29 so soon			2
victory against an @entity12 side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of @entity63 to be here would barely regain any pride for an @entity1 team who are still coming to terms with what they have done			1
@entity1 's @entity70 runs with a rugby ball during the training session on wednesday the @entity1 team gather round in a huddle as they prepare for the dead rubber against @entity12 but for @entity22 it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three - @entity82 series in the @entity83 next month that will be named on tuesday			1
@entity1 will be without @entity84 and @entity85 , two players who can still expect a one - day future , when they face @entity12 and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to @entity91 on april 2			1
@entity84 strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by @entity15 in @entity94 while @entity95 has a ‘ stress reaction ’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot			2
both will be assessed when @entity1 get home			0
in their absence it is to be hoped @entity1 give games to the two players yet to appear in this @entity29 in @entity104 and @entity105 , not least before both could then be making their final one - day international appearances			0
@entity1 's @entity108 bowls during the nets session at @entity25 @entity27 warms up ahead of a full training session in @entity25 on wednesday if @entity1 are serious about ever making an impact in one - day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019			1
that means there is little point in them persevering in 50 - over cricket beyond friday with the likes of @entity104 , @entity105 and the senior trio of @entity124 , @entity70 and @entity125 , who yesterday insisted he wants to play on			0
a dead rubber against @entity12 is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical @entity29 record as themselves – just a single victory against @entity133			0
there was a familiar figure at the helm of the @entity12 team at the @entity25 on wednesday in the avuncular form of coach @entity139 , the former @entity140 batsman who has ignored security advice to work in @entity142			1
@entity139 has been in charge of a team who have defeated @entity1 before – when he coached @entity146 in the @entity147 – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland			0
@entity22 ( left ) and @entity1 vice-captain @entity152 are pictured in discussion on the field @entity15 celebrate after sealing an upset victory against @entity1 at the @entity156 on monday ‘ @entity1 are not in the best of nick and we still believe we ’ve got a scare in us in this @entity29 , especially if we show composure at the top of the order , ’ said @entity139			1
‘ if we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock			0
‘ i ’m obviously sad to see @entity1 ’s demise but i ’m delighted to be here with @entity12			2
we ’ve had some great learning experiences , had our first win and gave @entity170 a scare			0
this has been a shop window for @entity12 cricket and i think we ’ve made friends			0
we play with a freedom that i ’ve tried to enhance			0
’ it is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in @entity1 ’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home			2
otherwise they will lose as many friends as the @entity12 have gained .			0

@entity1 take on @entity12 at the @entity25 on friday
defeat by @entity15 on monday *knocked* @entity1 out of the *competition*
@entity1 turned up early on wednesday for a full training session
