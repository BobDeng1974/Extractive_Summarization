ready for anything : ahead of the deployment , the @entity175 of the @entity176 spent last week on the ranges at @entity179 in @entity180 to hone their shooting skills tensions : the @entity183 fears the proposed @entity3 border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to @entity3 for work @entity59 claimed mr @entity2 had offered to ‘ de-escalate ’ the crisis after mr @entity62 issued a coded warning that @entity6 might take @entity3 to the @entity189 over the ‘ disproportionate ’ border checks			1
but within minutes of the call , the @entity3 government insisted they were doing nothing wrong			2

’ appeal : @entity62 asked the @entity3 prime minister to scale back contentious border checks with the @entity6 territory , including blocking flights to @entity12 access : the @entity3 government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros ( £ 43 ) charge on vehicles entering @entity12 and closing @entity3 airspace to flights heading for the @entity65 on the ground , @entity3 officials again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday , imposing more border checks when they spotted @entity247 deputy leader @entity246 viewing their operations			1
