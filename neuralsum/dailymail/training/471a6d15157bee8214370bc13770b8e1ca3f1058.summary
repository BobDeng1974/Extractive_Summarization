published : 07:38 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 09:27 est , 10 april 2013 @entity1 's most powerful rebel group has formally pledged allegiance to @entity4 leader @entity3 , according to recording posted online today			1
the @entity6 group , the strongest extremist movement in @entity1 , issued a statement of support for the terror network			2
@entity6 , leader of the @entity1 group , said : ' the sons of @entity6 renew their pledge ( of allegiance ) to the @entity15 and declare obedience			2
' @entity4 's branch in @entity18 and the most powerful rebel group in @entity1 have now officially joined ranks against president @entity21 to forge a potentially formidable militant force in the @entity23			1
rebel rise : men said to be from @entity4 affiliated @entity6 sit on a truck full of ammunition at @entity29 air base , which has been captured by the rebels , in @entity32 province , northern @entity1 new @entity34 front : rebels said to be from @entity4 affiliated @entity6 waving their brigade flag on the top of a @entity1 air force helicopter at insurgent - held @entity29 air base in @entity32 province , northern @entity1 the merger of the @entity42 in @entity18 and @entity6 forms a new entity that could be an even stronger opponent in the fight to topple @entity21 and become a dominant player in what eventually replaces his regime			1
the new group , called the @entity50 , underscores the growing confidence and muscle of @entity34 radicals fighting on the rebel side in @entity1 's civil war			1
it also bolsters the @entity1 government 's assertions that the regime is battling terrorists and that the uprising is a foreign - backed plot			2
while the @entity64 and its @entity66 and @entity67 allies are concerned about the rising prominence of @entity69 among the rebels , the merger is unlikely to prompt a shift in the international support			0
late last year , @entity73 declared that @entity6 had ties to @entity4 and designated it a terrorist organization			2
to try to counter the rising influence of @entity6 and other @entity50 extremists in the civil war , the @entity64 and its allies have boosted their support for rebel factions deemed to be more moderate			0
on the political front , they helped created the opposition umbrella group , the @entity85 , in the hope that it will serve as the united face of those trying to unseat @entity21 and administer much of the territory in northern @entity1 that rebels have managed to pry away from regime forces in the past year			1
the @entity64 and other countries also have stepped up covert support for rebels on the ground by helping to coordinate shipments of new weapons and training rebels in @entity100 , officials say			0
those receiving training are mainly secular @entity102 tribesmen from central and southern @entity1 who once served in the army and police			0
under attack : a member of the @entity108 runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to @entity1 's president @entity21 , in @entity112 yesterday attack on dictator : fighter from @entity34 @entity1 rebel group @entity6 runs with weapon as their base is shelled in @entity118 province , eastern @entity1 the force is seen as a counterbalance to the @entity50 militant groups - chief among them @entity6 - that have proven to be among the most effective of the myriad rebel factions fighting @entity21 's forces , officials say			1
the merger was announced by the leader of the @entity50 , @entity128 , in a 21 - minute audio message posted on militant websites late monday			0
a website linked to @entity6 known as @entity132 - the @entity50 emigrant - confirmed the merger			0
together , the groups will now be known as the @entity50 , @entity128 said			0
the @entity135 is the traditional name referring to the region from southern @entity138 to @entity139 on the eastern @entity140			0
' it is time to announce to the @entity135 people and the whole world that @entity6 is merely an extension and part of the @entity50 , ' he said			0
joint force : members of @entity34 @entity1 rebel group @entity6 hold a detainee as they transport him in @entity118 province , eastern @entity1 in a picture taken on march 14 he said the @entity18 group was providing half of its budget to the conflict in @entity1 , and that @entity6 would not have a separate leader but instead be led by the ' people of @entity1 themselves ' - implying that he would be in charge in both countries			1
the announcement comes two days after the leader of @entity4 , @entity3 , urged @entity50 fighters in @entity1 to unite in their efforts to oust @entity21			1
@entity6 , which has welcomed militants from across the @entity102 world into its ranks , has made little secret of its links across the @entity18 border , but until now it has not officially declared itself to be part of @entity4			1
the @entity1 group , which wants to oust @entity21 and replace his regime with an @entity50 state , first emerged in a video posted online in january 2012			1
since then , it has demonstrated its prowess - and ruthlessness - on the battlefield			0
it has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings against @entity1 government institutions and military facilities			0
the group 's success helped fuel a surge in its popularity among rebel fighters , although it has also emerged as a source of friction with more moderate and secular brigades in @entity1 .			2
