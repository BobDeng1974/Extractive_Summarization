the whacky piece , entitled @entity10 , tells you everything you need to know about the competition - an annual celebration of ' crap art '			1
the tongue - in - cheek competition is derived from @entity18 's leading art competition the @entity19 - and it is safe to say that it does n't take itself quite as seriously			2
the @entity10 : constructed from a car spring , a tea towel and a pair of sunglasses this piece encapsulates the @entity4 , held in the @entity28 pub in @entity29 , @entity30 @entity31 : this pun on the @entity18 slang phrase @entity34 is typical of the witty entries to the competition bread in @entity38 : @entity40 's hilarious , if not unsophisticated , piece is one of the entrants in the 14th @entity19			1
winners receive a turnip nailed to plank of wood the shortlist for this year 's satirical competition has just been announced and the lineup is every way as ridiculous as could be expected			1
bread in @entity38 , created by @entity40 , features a lonely bread roll peering out from behind the bars of a pet carrier			1

entries to the two competitions can best be described as from different ends of the artistic spectrum			0
children in @entity83 : entrants are awarded for a ' lack of effort ' and using a pun in the title , while they risk disqualification for ' too much effort ' the @entity126 : the competition 's organiser @entity129 said they needed another skip to deal with the number of entries @entity133 won last year 's @entity19 with his installation piece do words have voices - an abstract work recalling a melancholy park bench , featuring metallic trees and scattered , paper leaves			1
in comparison , 103 - year - old @entity141 beat 83 competitors to come out on top of last year 's @entity4 after entering a jar of muddy water - his take on the famous blues artist			2
