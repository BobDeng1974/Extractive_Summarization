@entity1 managing director @entity0 has boldly declared to @entity2 team principal @entity3 his aim that come late may there will be no further power - unit issues			1
last week @entity2 owner @entity7 warned @entity1 to solve their problems otherwise he would consider pulling his teams out of @entity10			1
a few days later @entity1 endured a @entity11 to forget as @entity12 's @entity2 and the @entity13 of @entity14 both suffered a power - unit failure			1
remarkably , @entity17 has now confirmed of being aware of the fact the system had a fault , one he is confident will be fixed come the @entity21 next month			2
@entity1 's @entity0 ( left ) has promised @entity2 that the engine problems will be resolved ' we knew there was a weakness , so there was a plan in place , ' said @entity0			1
' we need to make sure the plan is good enough for the size of the issues we have had , and whether it can be addressed fairly quickly			0
' i 'm not quite sure , from a logistical perspective , it could be addressed for this weekend 's race in @entity35			2
' but certainly our aim has been to have absolutely no reliability issues by @entity21			0
' we knew the first engine we built had some reliability weaknesses , and unfortunately we saw that in @entity41			0
unhappy @entity2 owner @entity7 threatened to pull out of @entity10 ' the plan is to make sure the future engine we will be building has absolutely no reliability issues			1
' that is of little comfort to @entity3 who goes into the fourth race of the season with one of his drivers having used two engines when only four are allowed per season otherwise penalties start to be applied			0
' i do n't think anybody expected us to be on engine three after race three in any of our scenarios , ' said an unhappy @entity3			0
' we accept sometimes to find performance you 've got to take some risks			0
calculated risks are what @entity2 has always bought into			2
@entity12 's @entity2 and the @entity13 of @entity14 both suffered a power - unit failure in @entity41 ' but the frustrating thing for both parties is we 're in this situation with three of our allotted four engines in use going into race four			1
' it is n't where we wanted to be , but we 've got to work our way out of it			0
' asked as to how he would manage this weekend given the fear of yet another engine failure , @entity3 replied : ' you 've just got to go for it and hope for the best			2
