by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 27 november 2013 an historic plantation has been destroyed after it was allegedly set on fire by a gang of men on a drug - fueled ' ghost hunt '			1
seven men have reportedly admitted burning down the landmark in the early hours of friday morning after breaking in to look for ghosts and smoke marijuana			1
the home , which was built in the 1850s near the @entity13 levee in @entity14 , was one of just two surviving plantation buildings in @entity14 , south of @entity17			1
destroyed : the historic @entity19 plantation , south of @entity17 , was destroyed by fire in the early hours of friday arrests : the fire was allegedly started by seven men who went to the house on a drug - fueled ghost hunt ruins : a charred shell is all that is left of the building which dates back to the 1850s suspects : the seven suspects charged in connection with the fire line up next to the sheriff 's van after their arrest @entity35 , 31 , @entity36 , 21 , @entity37 , 20 , @entity38 , 20 , and a 17 - year - old have all been charged with arson and simple burglary and criminal damage			1
two other men , @entity43 , 20 , and @entity44 , 29 , have been charged with accessory to arson			1
@entity43 has also been charged with criminal trespassing			1
@entity48 sheriff @entity47 said : ' they were in there looking for ghosts , drinking , smoking dope , and for some reason they made a decision - a conscious decision - before they left to set this building on fire			1
' he said that the men were door - to - door salesmen			1
before : how the historic house had looked before friday 's fire gone : very little remains of the house which has been used as a hotel and illegal casino over the years the land was first used as a plantation in 1721 and remained as a plantation for the next century or so			1
for around 30 years in the early 19th century , the land was used as a brickyard			2
@entity73 began on the house itself when @entity76 bought the land in 1851			0
although it had sixteen rooms , the @entity76 home only had one interior staircase for tax reasons			0
the building was completed in 1854 , but mr @entity83 died a few months later			0
the house remained in the @entity76 family until 1905 when it was bought by @entity86 and it was turned into the @entity87			0
burning : smoke billows from the building as fire crews begin to dampen down the flames on friday morning security : the owners of the building had installed a security fence around it , but that did n't deter the group of seven men who broke in the hotel changed hands again in 1928 when it was bought by @entity102 and renamed the @entity103			1
although it was a hotel by name , the house was reportedly used as an illegal casino - gun turrets built in closets during the prohibition days were said to have survived until friday 's fire			1
@entity76 house was bought by @entity111 in 1967 but deteriorated badly			0
a fire damaged the building in 1986 and attempts to restore it continually started but then failed			2
it was n't until 2003 that the building was stabilised , but the devastation of @entity119 in the area put paid to further restoration plans			2
it is thought that plans were in the pipeline to carry out further work on the home			0
according to reports , locals had for many years reported seeing a light go on and off in the cupola of the house despite there being no electrical connection			0
emergency operation : firefighters pictured at the scene of the fire on friday morning @entity76 house had been owned by the @entity138 which described friday 's fire as a ' tragedy '			1
in a statement , the foundation said : ' we are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our community 's most beloved treasures			0
' over the years we have wrestled with determining the best use for the plantation			2
' one of our duties as board members is to prioritize our actions in response to community needs			0
' given the millions of dollars required to restore the plantation , prudence dictated that we preserve the plantation while we worked to identify the best path forward			2
' @entity160 hired an architect who specializes in historic buildings and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on structural improvements and routine maintenance			2
' we made our best efforts to secure the land from trespassers			0
we installed an eight foot fence around the property and posted signs			0
' but it is doubtful that anything short of 24 hour patrols would have kept out these intruders intent on engaging in illegal activities			0
