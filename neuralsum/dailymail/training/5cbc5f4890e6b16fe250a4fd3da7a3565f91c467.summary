@entity70 commissioner @entity106 said : ' @entity107 and @entity13 used offensive language and arguably many people will find their comments to be insulting and unacceptable			1
' this situation is aggravated further by the fact the offensive remarks were made within a group of officers which suggests @entity1 and @entity13 thought their comments were appropriate work place banter			1
' fortunately , their colleagues were not prepared to let the remarks go unchallenged and they had the courage to report the officers ’ comments as well as providing evidence at the criminal trial			0
' to stand - up and report your peers in this way should not be underestimated and we acknowledge and thank those officers who had the fortitude to challenge the offensive remarks			0
' it is vital the @entity2 takes seriously reports of officers using racially offensive language			2
it can indicate a potential wider problem and can undermine the efforts being made to deliver the professional service the public deserves			0
