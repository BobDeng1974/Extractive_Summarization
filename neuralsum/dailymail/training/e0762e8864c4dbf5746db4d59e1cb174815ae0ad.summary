by @entity0 a flea - infested rabbit who was found dumped in a cardboard box after his owner 's benefits had allegedly been cut could now have an incurable disease - even though it would have cost just £ 20 to prevent it			1
the abandoned bunny was dumped among a pile of rubbish and old clothes near @entity12 tube , north @entity13 , in a box which said ' my owner ’s benefit has been cut '			1
the five - year - old straggly rabbit had horribly - matted fur , a bad infection in his floppy ears and was in such a bad state that the finder thought he was a guinea pig			0
the pet rabbit , @entity27 , was found dumped in a cardboard box near @entity12 tube , north @entity13 the box , found among a pile of old clothes and rubbish , said : ' please help me , i 'm 5yrs ( my owner benefit has been cut ) ' the flea - infested rabbit had matted fur and a bad infection in his ears when he was found earlier this week			1
it is now feared @entity27 could have myxomatosis - an incurable but preventable condition spread by fleas he also had overgrown nails measuring at least two inches - described by an animal welfare worker as the longest rabbit nails she had ever seen			1
but there are now fears the little bunny could have myxomatosis , an incurable but preventable disease spread by fleas			2
@entity53 , the animal welfare worker at @entity54 , where @entity27 was taken for treatment , said an annual flea vaccination - which could have prevented his condition - costs around £ 20			1
a parasite treatment , which can be given every three months to rabbits prone to fleas , is just £ 8			0
but once a rabbit has contracted the condition , it is unlikely they will survive longer than 14 days			0
she said : ' i have never seen nails as bad			0
they were at least two inches long and were curling around			0
@entity27 's nails were at least two inches long , meaning he had not been living in the right environment			1
if he was , the nails would have been worn down , an animal welfare expert said ' it shows he was not in the right environment because his nails were just not being worn down			0
' hay bale used for food and bedding - £ 2 per week pellets used for food - around £ 5 per week annual flea vaccination - £ 20 emergency parasite treatment - £ 8 ms @entity53 said @entity27 had been eating and moving around since being treated at the centre but was now undergoing treatment for his puffy eyes - a sign of the deadly disease			1
she said : ' @entity27 is eating and moving around , but we now believe he has myxomatosis			1
' he is having treatment for his eyes but , if it is what we think it is , he will not have a very good prognosis			0
' it 's just frustrating because everything @entity27 has is preventable			1
' a rabbit does not cost much to treat and there are many charitable organisations which would help someone on benefits if they could n't afford to give them the right vaccinations			0
' when he was found , the woman thought it might have been a guinea pig because of the way he looked			0
' ms @entity53 said rabbits mainly feast on hay which can be bought for just a few pounds from a pet shop			0
she said that , along with a bag of pellets costing around £ 10 , would feed a normal - sized rabbit for a few weeks			2
@entity111 , a vet at the centre , said : ' the frustrating thing about cases like poor @entity27 is that there are many outlets out there that are available that offers low cost preventative measures and his suffering could have easily been avoided			2
' if @entity27 becomes well enough to leave the survery , the vet will look for a new home for the little bunny .			2

the bunny , *nicknamed* @entity27 , found near @entity12 tube , north @entity13
he was abandoned in a cardboard box which said ' @entity130 '
*scrawling* on box *blamed* benefit cut for bunny 's poor condition - but an annual flea vaccination costs just £ 20
it is now believed @entity27 has myxomatosis , for which there is no cure
