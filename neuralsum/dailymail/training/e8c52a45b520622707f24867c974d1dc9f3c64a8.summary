by @entity1 reporter published : 07:33 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 19:24 est , 22 june 2012 the trial of mass killer @entity3 ended with him declaring that his bombing and shooting rampage that killed 77 people was necessary to defend @entity7 from multiculturalism			1
relatives of his victims walked out as he claimed : ‘ my brothers in the @entity7 and @entity15 resistance are sitting out there following this trial , while planning new attacks			1
they could be responsible for as many as 40,000 being killed			2
’ in his rambling closing statement yesterday , he also lashed out at everything he finds wrong with the world , from non-ethnic @entity7 representing the country in the @entity23 to the sexually liberated lifestyle of the characters in the @entity28 tv show @entity26			1
final arguments revolved around the question of whether he is a lunatic or not with his defence lawyer stating in closing arguments that @entity3 was sane and had the ‘ basic human right ’ to be punished for what he believed was a political act			2
if the judges agree with the prosecution that @entity3 is insane , he will be destined for a mental institution instead of a prison			2
while some of @entity3 's comments prompted laughter in the @entity69 court , a serious atmosphere returned when he reiterated his motive for bombing the @entity7 capital 's government headquarters , killing eight , and hunting down teenagers at the @entity75 's youth camp			1
sixty - nine people were dead and dozens more injured in one of the worst peacetime shooting massacres by a single gunman			1
' history shows that you have to commit a small barbarism to prevent a bigger barbarism , ' the 33 - year - old @entity7 said			1
' the attacks on july 22 were preventive attacks to defend the indigenous @entity7 people , ' he said			1
' i therefore demand to be acquitted			2
' carnage : the aftermath of the @entity69 car bomb planted by mass killer @entity3 blast : the @entity69 bomb left scores injured on july 22 last year @entity3 claims the governing @entity75 has betrayed the country by accepting @entity96 immigrants and must be stopped before turning @entity7 into what he called a ' multiculturalist hell '			1
earlier today , defence lawyer @entity99 had tried to prove his client is sane - the key issue to be resolved in the trial since @entity3 admits the attacks			1
the killer shouted ' i will kill you all ' and ' you shall die ' as he took down his victims on the island @entity99 also formally entered a plea for acquittal , but it was made out of principle , without any realistic chance of success			1
also today , relatives of some of those killed tried to put their loss in words			2
@entity119 , whose 30 - year - old daughter @entity120 was killed by the bomb , moved the court room to tears when she described the shock of finding out her daughter was dead , the grief of cleaning out her room and the first @entity128 without her			1
still , @entity119 said she felt a need to attend the trial , seeing @entity3 in a position where he could n't hurt anyone anymore			1
' i am not going to be afraid of this man , ' @entity119 said			2
' i decided i would go to court			2
i felt i owed it to @entity120			0
' the court room burst out in applause and audible sobs as she finished her statement			0
@entity3 remained motionless , his face blank			0
@entity99 tried to prove to the court that @entity3 's claims of being a resistance fighter in a struggle to protect @entity7 and @entity15 from being colonised by @entity96 are not delusional , but part of a political view shared by other right - wing extremist			1
testimony : @entity151 , a professor of psychiatry , testifies in the case against terror and murder charged @entity3 at a court in @entity69 deliberation : judge @entity158 listens to arguments today as legal teams debate the sanity of @entity3			0
the defendant himself has instructed his lawyers to fight that he is sane ' he realised that it is wrong to kill but he chose to kill			1
that 's what terrorists do , ' @entity99 said			0
' the ends justify the means			0
you do n't understand this if you do n't understand the culture of right - wing extremists			1
' ' when @entity3 talks about a civil war he 's not fantasizing about tanks and soldiers in the forest , but referring to a low - intensity struggle he believes will last for 60 years ' , @entity99 said			1
' none of us know what @entity15 will look like in 60 years , ' @entity99 said			0
' who would have thought 10 years ago that a right - wing extremist party in @entity185 would get 10 per cent in the election now ? ' two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about @entity3 's mental health			1
the first team diagnosed him with ' paranoid schizophrenia ' , a serious mental illness			0
force : this photo shows members of the @entity7 @entity197 land by boat on the shore of the island of @entity201 during @entity3 's shooting spree tributes : the @entity7 killed 77 people on july 22 last year , first detonating a car bomb in @entity69 , then going on a shooting rampage at a camp on @entity201 ( background ) the second team found him legally sane , saying he suffers from a dissocial and narcissistic personality disorder , but is not psychotic			1
prosecutors on thursday called for an insanity ruling , saying there was enough doubt about @entity3 's mental state to preclude a prison sentence			0
the five - judge panel will announce its ruling on august 24 , chief judge @entity218 said			1
if deemed mentally competent , @entity3 would likely be given @entity7 's maximum prison term of 21 years			1
a sentence can be extended beyond that if a prisoner is considered a menace to society			0
if declared insane , he would be committed to a mental institution for as long as he 's considered sick and dangerous to others			0
prosecutors suggested thursday that could mean he would be held for the rest of his life			0
@entity99 's otherwise focused statement ended on a confusing note when he asked the court for the most lenient possible prison sentence for his client			0
after being corrected by @entity3 , @entity99 said the defense asks for an acquittal or a lenient sentence , but primarily wants the court to reject the insanity claim			0
the trial , which started on april 16 in a purpose - built courtroom , started with @entity3 crying on the first day			1
it was the only time he showed any emotion during the trial and came as prosecutors showed a @entity249 video he posted online before the attacks			1
@entity3 shot 69 people , most of them teenagers , at the ruling @entity255 's summer camp on @entity201 , pictured with rescuers last july it outlined his perception that @entity96 are colonising @entity15 and that @entity259 @entity15 will rise up in armed @entity260 's defense lawyer @entity99 said that he was moved by being reminded of his self - imposed mission to ' save @entity15 from an ongoing war '			1
for the first two days @entity3 greeted the court with his own version of a fascist salute , but stopped after his lawyers told him that the victims ' families found it offensive			0
on the penultimate day , after prosecutors asked for an insanity ruling that he rejected , the salute was @entity273 , @entity3 thrust out his right arm with a clenched fist			2
this time he directed it straight at the prosecutors			0
survivors of his rampage gave harrowing accounts , but the most gruesome testimony was from the gunman himself			0
sparing no detail , he took a shocked courtroom through his killing spree on @entity201 , victim by victim , bullet by bullet			0
his facial expression remained blank			0
@entity3 's utter lack of emotion and empathy was seen by some psychiatrists as a symptom of a deep mental illness			0
he said he had prepared himself to keep his composure through meditation			0
the only outburst of anger during the entire trial came when an @entity303 man , whose brother was killed on @entity305 took off his shoe and tossed it at @entity3 on may 11 , hitting one of his defence lawyers			2
the hearing was briefly suspended as the man was led out of the court , crying			0
besides that incident , the relatives of victims kept remarkably calm , saying they wanted to respect the judicial process			0
some said @entity3 must not have any opportunity to claim he did n't get a fair trial when it 's all over			2
the five - judge panel will announce its ruling on august 24			2
video : @entity321 or not ? ! mixed reactions from experts , but their final answer is the same ...			0

mass killer also demanded to be set free on last day of his 10 - week trial
lashed out at ' everything he finds wrong with the world '
said non-ethnic @entity7 representing @entity23 was ' wrong '
