warning : a 16 - year - old has been left in a serious condition after police believe he took mortal kombat @entity18 believe the pair , who were admitted to @entity21 in @entity22 at about 11.30pm , had taken illegal drugs including ecstasy and ' possibly ' a mortal kombat tablet			1
the distinctive red tablet with a dragon image imprinted on it is an ecstasy - style drug and is thought to have been responsible for the death of 17 - year - old @entity30 last month			1
miss @entity30 , from @entity31 , died after taking one of the tablets at @entity35 nightspot @entity36 on february 1			2
today , warnings issued about the red pills following miss @entity30 's death were renewed			1
detective chief inspector @entity40 , of @entity41 , said : ' the two youths aged 16 and 17 remain in @entity21 after taking illegal drugs , including what is believed to be ecstasy , possibly a red ' mortal kombat ' tablet , last night			1
' we are continuing to work with our partner agencies including health officials and medical staff in connection with this investigation			0
' at this time our priority is to ensure that everyone who was at the house party is safe and well and officers are carrying out extensive enquiries to trace everyone involved			0
' further to previous warnings , i would again strongly advise people to avoid illicit drugs as their exact content is unknown and can contain dangerous chemicals			0
' users must be aware of these dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have			0
' dr @entity68 , @entity69 consultant in emergency medicine , added : ' we can not stress highly enough that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health , and indeed their life , in jeopardy			0
' users can never actually be sure of what they are taking and what the contents are			0

' currently , the full ingredients of the so - called @entity98 pill remain unknown , but drug experts have warned it may contain another substance called @entity102 , which was blamed for the deaths of more than 10 young people within a 60 - mile radius of @entity106 last year			1
@entity102 is sold in pills costing as little as Â £ 3 or in a crystal - like form , are sometimes pink and shaped like @entity110 sweets , or stamped with an 'm '			2
tragic : @entity30 died after taking mortal kombat in a @entity35 nightclub , @entity36 , last month the drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy 's main chemical , @entity120			2
but the active ingredient in @entity102 is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in , meaning many revellers take extra pills			2
@entity102 has been linked to multiple deaths , both in the @entity125 and in @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
detective inspector @entity129 , of @entity130 , appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward			0
