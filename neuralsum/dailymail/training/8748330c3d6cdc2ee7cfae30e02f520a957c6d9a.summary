the calls to 911 raised an instant alarm : one caller said he shot his co-workers at a @entity5 video game company and had hostages			1
another in @entity8 said her father was drunk , wielding a machine gun and threatening their family			1
a third caller on @entity15 's @entity14 claimed to have killed his mother and threatened to shoot first responders			1
in each case , swat teams dispatched to the scene found no violent criminals or wounded victims â€” only video game players sitting at their computers , the startled victims of a hoax known as ' swatting			1
' here , @entity37 police officers enter a home in @entity39 , @entity40 , in search of an armed killer , based on a phone call that turned out to be a hoax authorities say the hoax that initially targeted celebrities has now become a way for players of combat - themed video games to retaliate against opponents while thousands of spectators watch			1
the perpetrators can watch their hijinks unfold minute by minute in a window that shows a live video image of other players			2
' it 's like creating your own episode of ' cops , ' said dr. @entity62 , a research psychologist who studies online behavior , referring to the long - running reality tv show that follows officers on patrol			2
the players , who are often many miles away , look up their opponent 's addresses in phone directories , sometimes using services that can find unlisted numbers			1
they also exploit online programs that trick 911 dispatchers into believing an emergency call is coming from the victim 's phone or address			2
all the while , they conceal their own identities and locations			2
authorities spent an estimated $ 100,000 to send more than 60 officers in april to the hoax in @entity39 , @entity15			1
investigators said the caller was upset over losing a game of @entity89 when he called police using @entity92			2

instead , they found him playing @entity122 for a live audience over @entity124 , an online network with millions of viewers			2
' the officers responding do not know , other than the information they 're getting over the radio , exactly what is going on , ' said @entity115 police capt. @entity132			0
less than a week later , police received another bogus call routed through the man 's phone that made it appear he had called in a bomb threat to a @entity115 gas station			0

other members live in the @entity150 , according to the @entity151 , which is still trying to learn their identities			0
swatting captured headlines several years ago , when a series of celebrity homes were targeted in @entity157			1
police were so concerned about copycat crimes that they stopped releasing any public information when a hoax occurred			0

' you can literally do it from around the world , ' said @entity171 , assistant professor of computer science at @entity173			0
' it can be very challenging ( to solve ) depending on the sophistication of the person doing it			0
' realizing the difficulty , police in @entity179 , @entity5 , sought help from @entity151 agents in @entity183 who are specially trained to solve cyber-crime			1
@entity62 , the psychologist , said the prevalence of live game - streaming might be one reason for the trend			0
as the victim in the @entity5 case , @entity192 , put it to @entity194 : ' they get to see all this go down right before their eyes and , you know , it 's fun to them			1
' intensely competitive war games that blur the lines of fantasy and reality could also contribute , said dr. @entity204 , a psychologist who directs the @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207			0
' they want to win at all costs , including jeopardizing someone 's safety , ' she said			0
' real life becomes almost meaningless because they 're so entrenched and involved in these games			0
swatting , to them , seems like part of the game			2
' a video of the aug. 27 incident in @entity179 posted on @entity220 shows @entity192 playing a first - person shooter game when he hears officers approaching			0
' i think we 're getting swatted , ' he says , raising his hands as heavily armed officers shout for him to get on the ground			0
he drops , and officers handcuff and frisk him			0
' that 's live streaming , ' @entity192 tells the officers			0
' i guess a joker thought it would be funny to call you guys in			0
