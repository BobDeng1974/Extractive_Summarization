racegoers at @entity7 last year			1
the venue has now decided to ban picnics saying chairs were a ' potential trip hazard ' but racegoers accused the venue of profiteering by encouraging people to eat at its on - site facilities and of stripping the fun out of events at the course			1
the move was even criticised by the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , a government watchdog , who said that there was no legislation to stop people from eating picnics at large gatherings			1
bosses said that the ban , which will apply to all meetings at the venue excluding the @entity44 , arose from numerous problems at events last year			2
the racecourse attracts up to 20,000 on its busiest days , with bosses claiming that up to 5,000 people were blocking lawns around the venue at each event by bringing in chairs and picnic boxes			1

‘ the amount of people bringing in chairs , rugs , picnic boxes etc caused space to be limited for the number of people attending the race days due to picnickers spreading out , ’ he said			1
‘ the added furniture was a potential trip hazard and a few people reported to first aid because of this			2
‘ people are under no obligation whatsoever to purchase food while in the racecourse grounds			1
’ ‘ we are definitely not taking away people ’s enjoyment and want people to have a better time compared to last year			2

@entity117 , who attends ladies day at the course with a group of friends every year , said they planned to boycott the venue			0
she said : ‘ i am shocked			0
it ’s been traditional for everyone to go to a meeting and have a picnic in the @entity128 area on the lawn			0
‘ it ’s fun and it ’s friendly			0
it ’s a special occasion when you take your own picnic			0
’ miss @entity117 , from @entity134 , added : ‘ it ’s profiteering and i think they will lose business			0
the racecourse attracts up to 20,000 on its busiest days , with bosses claiming that up to 5,000 people were blocking lawns around the venue at each event by bringing in chairs and picnic boxes ‘ they have taken the fun out of the event			1
it ’s a short - sighted move and the racecourse will see it is a decision that will turn the public away			2
’ @entity152 posted on @entity153 : ‘ this has nothing to do with health and safety			0
it ’s so you will pay top prices for their food at the course			0

it ’s a shame , i wo n’t be going again			0
we ’ve gone for a number of years , it ’s disappointing			0
’ in a tongue and cheek message on its official @entity175 page , the @entity33 said the excuse for banning picnics was a ‘ non-runner ’ , adding ‘ these silly h&s excuses have gone on furlong enough # bustedmyth ’			1
a @entity33 spokesmen said : ‘ we see these health and safety stories fairly regularly and they often result in the @entity33 getting a lot of grief when we have not even been involved , so we have decided to go on the offensive			2
‘ there is no health and safety legislation to stop people eating picnics at such a venue			1
