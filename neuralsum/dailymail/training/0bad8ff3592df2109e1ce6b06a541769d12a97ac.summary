' so i used to use a needle and make some simple drawings behind a leaf and on a leaf			0
@entity5 ( pictured ) spends up to three hours every day learning how to carve the leaves he says ' too many people just see the beauty of this art but i am also trying to tell a story with each leaf ' the 35 - year - old creates the designs using a scalpel , a magnifying glass and a needle before pressing the leaves on paper and adding wood glue ' two years ago me and my wife were walking in the @entity69 area and we found some heavy and beautiful leaves and we put them in a book to press them ' about that time i visited a gallery and saw an exhibition on paper cutting - it was then i decided to give these leaves we found another life			1
' my wife is a professional artist and she does @entity81 miniature artwork so she taught me how to use the leaves - the first year i practiced for two or three hours every day			0
' too many people just see the beauty of this art but i am also trying to tell a story with each leaf			0
' with my portraits i i have also tried to give some people who are dead another life			0
' the process of carving each leaf can take anything from a few days up to a month ( pictured left - an impression of @entity96 's famous painting @entity97 ) he added : ' the process of carving each leaf can take one or two days or up to one month , i use just two or three tools - a scalpel , a magnifying glass and sometimes a needle			1
' i just press the leaves , i do n't use any chemical things or anything like that , after i 've finished i simply use wood glue and press them on the paper			0
' @entity111 had the apple falling from the tree , for thousands of years nobody made this connection , the most important message around my work is to look better at the world around us			0
' mr @entity5 , originally from @entity39 , claims he has been approached by a website connected with the @entity41 and says he wants to show the world that art can be found even in the most simple places the 35 - year - old 's works include this image of a dragon appearing to burst out from a split tree the artist said : ' carving these leaves resonates to my childhood , i had no time for playing football outside '			2
