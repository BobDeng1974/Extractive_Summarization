shoplifters are being sent to food banks as part of a crackdown on crime as police raise concerns that hunger is behind the rising number of offences across @entity10			1
police chiefs around the country have raised concerns over a sharp rise in the numbers of first - time offenders stealing from supermarkets			1
quarterly crime figures due to be released next week are expected to show an increasing number of shoplifting offences recorded by 37 of @entity10 's 43 police forces , according to @entity22			1
austerity crime : shoplifters are being sent to food banks as part of a crack down on crime as police raise concerns that hunger is behind the rising number of offences across @entity10 however , the country 's overall crime rate is falling as the success of @entity36 's @entity35 - which accounts for around 20 per cent of all recorded crime - is obscuring rising figures in other areas			1
according to @entity22 the new figures from the @entity41 will show that crime in the capital has fallen by around six per cent , while other forces experience a rise			1
' without this progress in @entity36 , it might not be possible for the @entity52 to laud a national crime reduction this year , ' @entity36 's deputy mayor for policing and crime @entity49 told the newspaper			1
in 2012 - 13 there were 36,500 shoplifting offences in the capital , compared with 42,000 in 2009 - 10			2
mr @entity49 said @entity35 commissioner sir @entity58 should be credited for the falling crime rate			1
' @entity60 here are on the back foot because the cops are working harder and smarter , not because more people are in work , ' he added			0
trend : in @entity68 instances of shoplifting have increased by 21.7 per cent compared with last year help : @entity68 pcc @entity69 said arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts assistant commissioner @entity77 , from the @entity35 , said : ' we are committed to cutting crime , with burglary at its lowest in 40 years and robbery at its lowest in 15 years			1
we ’ve also had some excellent results in tackling gangs , weapon - related crime and youth violence			2
' this has been achieved as a result of a lot of hard work by our officers across @entity36 with the support from our partners and the public to bring offenders to justice and improve our service to victims			2
' we are moving in the right direction , but there ’s still a great deal of work to do to cut crime further			0
i hope the people of @entity36 will be reassured by these successes and our commitment to making our city a safe and great place to be			2
' but while the capital is leading the country 's economic recovery , police in other areas have blamed austerity for rising numbers of shoplifting offences			1
in @entity68 instances of shoplifting have increased by 21.7 per cent compared with last year , and the area 's police and crime commissioner said such thefts now accounted for 10 per cent of all crime in the region			1
@entity69 said he believed hunger is an underlying cause of the offences , and told business leaders at a meeting last week that arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts			1
' officers tell me that interviews of offenders and analysis of types of items stolen suggest many offences are committed to raise money to feed a drug habit or to obtain food , ' he told the @entity146 and the @entity147			2
research from @entity149 suggests that the number of adults and children using food banks has now exceeded 900,000			1
the charity said that 913,000 people , 330,205 of them children , had received at least three - days ' emergency help during 2013 - 14 , with researchers claiming the 162 per cent jump in people seeking assistance is due to rising living costs combined with low pay and problems over welfare payments			0
the @entity149 now has more than 400 food banks across the @entity10 , and aims to have one in every town			1
the banks were opening at a rate of two a week to cope with the number of people facing food shortages , but this is now down to one			2
the government introduced tougher rules aimed at benefit claimants last october including raising the minimum sanction for violations from one to four weeks			0
more than 20 charities , including the @entity149 have written to the government accusing them of violating people 's basic right to food			0
however , the @entity184 said it was the growth in the number of food banks which has increased demand rather than new benefit regulations			1
a letter signed by 600 church leaders including 36 @entity193 bishops earlier this year called on the government to deal with what it described as a ‘ national crisis ’ of poverty and people living below the bread line			0
but their concerns contradict findings by the @entity204 which show food poverty in @entity10 has reduced dramatically			1
only 8.1 per cent reported struggling to afford food in 2012 – down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 , before the economic crisis			0
' more work is required to quantify the impact which the current economic climate and benefit changes are having on crime levels			0
' in the meantime , work is taking place to identify the location and operating hours of food banks and other support services			1
this information will then be made available in local communities and handed to those arrested for shoplifting			0
' mr @entity69 added that stores would be encouraged to issue civil banning orders for offenders as part of a crack down on shoplifting			0
earlier this year @entity230 's @entity229 blamed welfare cuts for a rise in shoplifting by women. , saying there was growing evidence that women were being driven to steal nappies and food because they were getting fewer benefits			2
referring to crime figures in the @entity243 , the senior barrister declared : ‘ at the end of last year , it was apparent that people were starting to steal items they could once afford			0
' there ’s been growing evidence to suggest this is due to the impact of both poverty and welfare reform , with people stealing what they were once able to take for granted and just go out and buy			0
‘ the growth in the number of first - time women shoplifting offenders would suggest it ’s affecting the poorer women in our communities , those who are experiencing the impact of the welfare reforms			2
’ @entity265 , the foodbank network for the @entity149 - a charity which co-ordinates the only nationwide network of food banks in the country - said police had referred people to its food banks , but not necessarily for shoplifting			1
' for many years our food banks have partnered with a wide variety of local organisations , whether that 's charities or the police , ' he told @entity278			1
' from time to time they will see people in genuine crisis who have no option but to go to food banks , they could be the victims of crime , and we trust the judgement of people who refer them to us			1
' they may be stealing for different reasons , and with regards to what the @entity294 was saying , he 's talking i would presume about basic items such as bread and milk rather than high end electricals			1
' we would trust the police 's judgement to sign post people to charities who are best place to support people in a variety of crises			0
' he added : ' i have launched a food bank in @entity311 , we partner with the local police team and from time to time we get referrals but very very few have been down to shoplifting			2
' over the years we have fed more than 10,000 people and less than a handful have come to us with shoplifting issues			0
' we have seen an elderly person come to us after committing shoplifting , who was incredibly embarrassed and it was the first time they had committed and offence			0
they were embarrassed to ask for help			0
' volunteer : @entity328 , the @entity329 at the @entity331 bank prepares shopping bags of food for those in need figures from the @entity337 , released in april , showed that crime in @entity339 and @entity340 fell by 15 per cent last year compared with 2012			2
the survey , which tracks all crimes committed by interviewing victims , and as a result includes offences not reported to the police , showed there were 7.5million offences in 2013 , down from almost 9million in 2012			0
there was a 22 per cent fall in household theft , a 15 per cent fall in vandalism and a 4 per cent drop in burglary			0
however , fraud rose by 25 per cent and shoplifting was up 6 per cent			0
