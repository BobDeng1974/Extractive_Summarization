by @entity0 published : 04:16 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 05:41 est , 25 september 2013 a morbidly obese bus inspector who tipped the scales at 31st 7lb has shed more than half his body weight after being shamed for taking up multiple seats on the tube			1
@entity7 , 52 , from @entity8 , was carrying around the equivalent of 128 bags of sugar in weight after eating unhealthily for almost two decades			1
but after warnings from doctors and daily angry stares from commuters , @entity7 decided to overhaul his diet and now weighs a trim 14st 7lb			1
slimline : bus conductor @entity7 poses in one of his old @entity22 blazers after losing a colossal 17st big change : @entity7 now weighs just 14st 7lb but used to weigh a mighty 31st 7lb and was morbidly obese ' when you are that size you become withdrawn , withdrawn from society , you do n't want to go out to things because people will look at you , ' @entity24 revealed			1
' you become very self conscious that you are being scrutinised			2
looks are one thing but the emotional side also takes a right pounding			2
i was not proud of what i had done to myself over the years			2
' at his biggest , @entity7 had a 60in waist and struggled with simple activities such as climbing the stairs and keeping up with his five - year - old grandson			1
' i was eating chocolate bars and various junk food all the time - i have a very sweet tooth , ' he added			1
' but my health started to deteriorate			1
i had very high blood pressure			2
it was quite a shock to hear what the @entity46 said			2
i was at that point in my life that i realised i had put my family through a lot by being this way			2
' particularly hard for @entity7 was the realisation that he might not live to see his grandson grow up , which made him increasingly desperate to shed the pounds			1
' i was very overweight throughout my daughter 's lives but now i have a grandson , ' he said			2
' i did n't want him remembering his grandfather like that			0
i could n't do anything about the past but i could so something about the future			0
relieved : @entity63 , 52 , is thrilled that her husband has finally managed to shift the pounds unhealthy : @entity7 was warned that he might not see his grandson grow up unless he lost weight ' i had just carried on and put off doing something about it for years			1
but it got to a point where i could not carry on			0
it was becoming too much			0
' @entity7 's solution was to join @entity72 's where he was swiftly put on a programme that replaced daily @entity76 breakfasts and carb - laden sandwiches with healthy salads , fruit and vegetables			1
snacking was banned , while weekly weigh - ins helped to keep him on track as the pounds slowly but surely dropped off			1
he also started walking everywhere and two years later , he now weighs just 14st 7lb and has a trim 34in waist			1
' my blood pressure is back to normal , i am physically fit and i 'm off all my medication - the doctor said i have got my health back , ' said @entity7			1
' i used to go everywhere in the car , even short journeys , but now i walk everywhere			0
i walk to work and as much as i can and only use the car once a week			0
' i 'm even doing a 26 - mile walk for charity , which before was something i could never of imagined doing			0
' everything has changed now			0
i have changed so much as a person and really come out of my shell			0
i 've never been so happy			0
i look at myself in the mirror now and i ca n't believe it			0
' my wife says i now turn heads for the right reasons			0
there are so many things i can do now that i would not do before			0
' happy ending : @entity7 says his impressive weight loss has made a huge positive difference to his life @entity109 @entity76 breakfast @entity111 large sandwiches and a cake			1
