@entity6 , just 17 months old , rescued @entity7 , 61 , on @entity8 after a sweet from a @entity10 continental chocolate box got stuck			1
ms @entity7 , an it technician who looks after @entity6 while she is training , told @entity13 how the insightful animal seemed to know exactly what to do when she got into trouble			1
heroic : guide dog @entity6 , just 17 months old , rescued @entity7 , 61 , on @entity8 after a sweet from a @entity10 continental chocolate box got stuck in her throat she said : ' it was new @entity20 , about 11.30pm			1
@entity6 was flat out asleep by then because we 'd gone out for the afternoon and she 'd had a long walk			1
' i 'd gone into the dining room , and on my way back there was a box of chocolates			0
i picked one up , put it in my mouth and immediately it got stuck in my windpipe			2
and it did n't seem to matter what i did , i could n't get rid of it			2
' so i then walked from the dining room back into the living room where @entity6 was - she was still fast asleep			2
i was standing there , still with my back to her and i was facing the settee			0
by this time i was starting to panic because i could n't breathe			2
' but she had obviously heard me , and jumped up , ran past me , jumped onto the settee - which is not what she does at all - looked straight at me , got up onto her back legs - she 's quite a big dog - and with her two front paws she just lurched at me and hit me in the chest			2
and it dislodged the chocolate			0
' choking : ms @entity7 , an it technician who looks after trainee guide dogs , treated herself to the chocolate as she bid 2013 farewell			1
but when she sat down on her sofa , the chocolate became lodged in her throat , leaving her gasping for breath instinctive : @entity6 , a cross breed between a @entity64 and a @entity65 , jumped on to the sofa and launched her front paws at ms @entity7 's chest , dislodging the chocolate training : @entity6 is almost at the end of her training , which can take between 17 and 20 months			1
she is cared for by ms @entity7 while she is training at a guide dog centre in @entity73 @entity6 , a cross-breed between a @entity64 and @entity65 , is almost at the end of her training , which can take between 17 and 20 months			1
she is cared for by ms @entity7 - a so - called ' boarder ' - while she is not training at a guide dog centre in @entity73			1
she lives alone other than @entity6			2
as part of their training guide dogs are often taught to interact physically with the people they help - for example to stop them walking into the road			0
but knowing how to deal with a person who is choking would not be part of their training , and is instead down to @entity6 's instincts and intelligence , according to ms @entity7			1
she said : ' the more i tell the story the more i wonder how she knew to do that			0
it was instantaneous , she did n't panic or anything			0
it was immediate what she did			0
' clever pooch : ms @entity7 said : ' the more i tell the story the more i wonder how she knew to do that			1
it was instantaneous , she did n't panic or anything			0
it was immediate what she did ' ' they are very clever , intelligent dogs , and @entity6 is particularly clever			2
i 've had her since november , while she was doing her training			0
i 've had a couple of dogs before @entity6 , but i knew straight away she was very quick			1
' it does n't bear thinking about what might have happened if @entity6 had n't been there			1
the chocolate might have dislodged itself , it might not have done			0
' i sat there afterwards in shock for a while - but when it dawned on me what she 'd actually done i just gave her a big cuddle			0
' i love all the dogs that i have , but @entity6 particularly is such a clever guide dog			1
i wish i could keep her			0
that wo n't happen - she has to do the job she 's trained to do			0
but because of what she 's done she 'll always be a bit special for me			0

@entity7 , 61 , was choking at home in @entity73 on @entity8
@entity6 , the trainee guide dog she looks after , immediately knew what to do
she leapt up onto a sofa and *lunged* at her to dislodge the sweet
ms @entity7 said : ' it does n't bear thinking about what might have happened if @entity6 had n't been there '
