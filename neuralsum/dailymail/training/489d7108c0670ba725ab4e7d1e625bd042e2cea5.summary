by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 24 november 2013 the picture of an urbanely handsome , silver - haired man caught the eye of lonely women across both @entity5 and @entity6			1
an @entity8 education , glittering cv and worldly sophistication added to his allure			1
and when he revealed he was a widower raising his small son alone , he could not have sounded like a more perfect love - match			1
however , the photographs and career highlights belonged to @entity19 politician lord @entity18 , who is gay and happily married to @entity21 @entity20			1
trick : a fake @entity24 profile set up using pictures of @entity18 as part of a ' silver fox ' dating con aimed at scamming money from single women his identity had been lifted from the internet by a gang of international fraudsters stalking single women on both sides of the @entity38			1
the conmen used his details to create rogue profiles on reputable dating websites , cross-referenced with matching fake accounts on @entity24 and @entity44			1
once online romance had blossomed , the tricksters asked for money to be wired to a @entity49 account in @entity50 on the pretext of either a business opportunity or a personal crisis			1
the complex ‘ @entity55 ’ fraud was unveiled when two women who had fallen for @entity58 ’s pictures tracked him down in real life to warn him			1
fury : lord @entity18 , who was alerted to the scam by women who had been duped , is gay and happily married to @entity21 @entity20 it is the latest twist in a global phenomenon where handsome older men – so - called @entity68 – are used as bait for lonely middle - aged women , who often have access to cash after being widowed or divorced			1
as well as lord @entity18 , @entity6 general @entity74 ’s photograph and military background routinely appear on fake internet dating profiles			1
he is one of the most highly decorated four - star generals of the @entity6 military			1
war hero : photographs of @entity6 colonel @entity81 were also used on fake profiles @entity19 @entity83 hero colonel @entity81 has also been exploited			1
the former officer from the @entity85 shot to global prominence after his eve - of - battle speech to troops in @entity89 in 2003			1
the married father of five once received an anguished email from an @entity6 woman waiting for him at @entity93 – asking why ‘ he ’ had not disembarked from his flight after she had bought ‘ him ’ a ticket home from the @entity97			1
fake emails purportedly from him to other @entity6 lonely hearts claim he is divorcing his wife and making a fresh start in the @entity6 , where he has been given a new home by the president for his ‘ services to humanity ’			1
last night lord @entity18 spoke out to condemn the cruel conmen , saying : ‘ these women have been profoundly confused and distressed , extraordinarily strong emotional attachments have developed and money has changed hands			1
‘ it ’s been devastating for them and i am powerless to stop it			2
who knows how many more victims have chosen , through embarrassment or sheer heartbreak , to keep quiet			2
’ the 55 - year - old @entity121 peer was alerted to the hijacking of his pictures and data when a @entity126 single mother emailed to say she had been swindled			2
within 48 hours , the former deputy assistant commissioner of the @entity128 had also been contacted by an @entity6 nurse			1
the gang pretending to be lord @entity18 are @entity50 and use aliases for him – @entity132 in the @entity6 and @entity133 in @entity126			1
one of the @entity133 victims , a divorced mother of three from @entity136 , spoke to @entity137 on condition of anonymity			2
' betrayed ' : nurse @entity140 fell victim to the ' @entity55 ' scam nurse @entity140 fell victim to the @entity55 scam after signing up with @entity6 site @entity145 last month			1
@entity140 , 60 , of @entity147 , received a message from a man calling himself @entity132 – who used lord @entity18 ’s pictures and professional details from his time as a @entity128 chief			1
@entity132 invited the divorcee to become a friend on @entity24 and within days she was spending up to three hours a night chatting to him on the social media site			2
she said : ‘ i could n’t believe that this distinguished , educated , sophisticated man – let ’s face it , he was a great catch – wanted to spend so much time with me			2
' i was flattered but a bit baffled when he started asking me what kind of jewellery i liked and if i ’d accompany him on some of his round - the - world trips			2
‘ it was my 15 - year - old grandson who said , “ this is too good to be true			2
” he did an image search on @entity176 and showed me photos of @entity18			2
‘ he said : “ @entity179 , this man is the mayor of @entity180			2
’ ’ [ lord @entity18 was twice @entity121 candidate for mayor ]			2
my first thought was , “ why has the @entity181 stolen @entity132 ’s photos ? ’ ’ ‘ that shows you how deep you can get in just a few days			2
‘ i always thought internet dating was a safe choice and , in retrospect , i ignored a lot of red flags			1
i feel hurt , betrayed , used , embarrassed and angry at my own gullibility			0
’ she told how @entity133 had been portrayed as a widowed @entity193 engineer working in @entity194 and raising an eight - year - old son alone			0
within days she was chatting to him for two hours at lunchtime and two hours in the evening			0
‘ i became emotionally dependent on him very fast , ’ she recalls			0
‘ he reached out to me , let me dream of a future together and told me things i desperately wanted to be true			0
' it was a slick psychological con trick			0
‘ he dropped into conversation a couple of times that his company did fundraising for a hospital in @entity50 and he went there to help			0
‘ so when he called me from @entity208 on one occasion it checked out			0
i thought he was a humanitarian helping with blankets and clothes for sick children			0
vulnerable : the con is aimed at luring lonely women and tricking them into sending cash ' while there , he asked for money , € 850 [ £ 710 ] , to pay for the shipping costs of some gold which he said would secure his future and mine			0
' it was a line from a b - list movie and i fell for it			0
i thought if i did n’t send the money then i would n’t get to see him when he came back as promised			0
‘ i wired € 300 [ £ 250 ] which took me up to my overdraft limit			0
when he demanded more i guessed i ’d been conned – i wanted to run to the bathroom to be physically sick			0
‘ my 16 - year - old daughter used image - matching technology and identified @entity133 as @entity18			0
i have n’t told many people or gone to the police			0
i am too sad and ashamed			0
' worst of all is that for the month i was corresponding with @entity133 , i was the happiest i have been in many years			0
’ partly in response to the scale and seriousness of these online dating scams , 13 of @entity19 ’s best - known internet dating websites have formed a new trade association – the @entity244 – to be launched next month			1
one of its key concerns will be its members ’ ability to safeguard the hearts and wallets of vulnerable clients			0
its chief executive will be @entity255 , a former @entity19 consul and ex-cabinet office director responsible for compliance policy			0
he said : ‘ online dating is now part of everyday life , it ’s the biggest single way people meet			0
‘ the industry has matured to the point that it needs a code of practice and membership of the @entity244 will be like a hallmark people can trust			0
' our members each have their own technological methods of policing profiles and protecting clients and , of course , they have regard for the vulnerability of people ’s circumstances			0
‘ they do all they can , but they are not there to replace common sense			0
the guiding principle in online dating has to be : if you would n’t tell or give someone something in real life , do n’t do it on the internet			1
