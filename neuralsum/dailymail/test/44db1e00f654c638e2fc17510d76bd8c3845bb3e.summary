@entity1 boss @entity0 has revealed he was warned about taking over at @entity2 by @entity3 - but insists he has made the right decision			1
the former @entity6 midfielder steered his new side to their third victory on the bounce with sunday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity12			1
it was a crucial triumph that moves @entity14 back into second place in the @entity16 and looks to have restored vital momentum ahead of the end - of - season play - offs			2
@entity0 says he was warned not to take the @entity1 job but is pleased that he took the risk in the end @entity0 has managed to unite a forlorn band of players since taking over a month ago and quickly transformed them into real promotion contenders			1
but he has revealed nine - in - a - row boss @entity3 - who @entity0 says was the ' greatest manager ' he ever worked for - called to make sure the former @entity27 international knew what he was letting himself in for when he agreed to replace @entity30			1
@entity0 , who still does not know if he will remain in charge beyond the summer , told @entity32 : ' @entity3 rung me up on the day i took the job and asked if i knew what i 'd let myself in for			1
' but in fairness , he understood i would never have got the opportunity to manage such a wonderful club like this [ were it not for the club 's current circumstances ]			2
the @entity14 boss has seen his new side win their last three games in a row including a crucial win over @entity12 ' even though i knew it was a gamble and the pitfalls , just to be part of it has been great			1
' regardless of what happens at the end of the season , i have relished every minute of it and i 'm thoroughly enjoying it , especially with the results being good			0
' @entity1 ' promotion hopes looked to have crumbled earlier this season as previous bosses @entity59 and @entity30 struggled to maintain the required levels of morale and confidence amid the din generated by the club 's bitter off - field civil war			1
@entity68 's boardroom coup saw @entity0 brought in to rally the troops and his impact has been impressive			1
@entity71 ( centre ) fires home the opening goal for @entity1 during sunday 's @entity16 game newly - crowned @entity16 winners @entity12 were clapped on to the pitch by the home players at @entity2			1
but it was @entity1 who left the field to cheers after clinging onto victory after playing the entire second half a man down following skipper @entity86 's red card just before the break			2
@entity71 and @entity88 netted a pair of clinical strikes and @entity0 believes the quality of his side 's goals only proves that the feel - good factor has returned to @entity96 's south side			1
he told the @entity1 website : ' they were brilliant and the first was a good move down the left			2
on - loan @entity88 ( centre ) curls home his sides second goal at @entity2 to put them in command ' i think everyone knows @entity110 's capabilities when he gets forwards			1
@entity112 has played him in with a good weighted pass and it was a great cutback and a fantastic finish by @entity30			0
he is just playing off @entity116 at the moment and doing it really well			0
' the second goal is why @entity88 played today			2
he 's got a goal in him , he 's a threat			0
he can come in on his left foot and do what he did so it did n't surprise me when he picked it up there that it ended up in the back of the net			0
' i felt for him at half - time			2
i explained to him that we had to bring him off and it was nothing to do with his performance , it was just because of the change of shape			0
' he took it well , he understands , but what is good in the dressing room is that it 's not just the 11 or the 14			0
there 's about 22 lads and staff and everybody in there was congratulating each other for that performance			0
it 's good to keep the momentum , the belief and the confidence high			0
' the @entity153 celebrates his goal as he continues to impress during his spell from @entity157 rangers take on @entity159 at @entity160 on thursday night and @entity0 is expecting another battle after @entity14 lost 2 - 0 under @entity59 's charge the last time they visited in december			1
he said : ' i saw @entity159 against @entity164 and they are well organised and we know what happened the last time we were down there			0
' it was a tough night so they 'll be confident as well after their victory			0
but the momentum carries on and we are going to have to be at our best on thursday			0
