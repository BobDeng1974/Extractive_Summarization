@entity1 boss @entity0 , 57 , has been branded ‘ tone deaf ’ after releasing a decadent @entity3 card in which he hits tennis balls around his palatial home			1
the millionaire chief executive of @entity8 sent out the photo which critics said was like he was saying : ‘ hey , we ’re so rich we can destroy our own stuff ’			1
in the photo @entity0 , of @entity12 , gleefully swings his tennis racket as his wife @entity15 , their three daughters and their dog laugh and look relaxed in the background			2
@entity0 's @entity3 card has been branded ' tone deaf ' and implies ' hey , we 're so rich we can destroy our own stuff ' they seem unconcerned that in the room are expensive ornaments , vases , glass and a @entity29 painting which could easily be ruined if a tennis ball went flying through it			1
critics said that the card was tasteless in a time of economic hardship as @entity0 earns $ 18.7m a year , making him one of the best compensated bosses in @entity37 @entity8 has also paid out more than $ 13billion in fines in the past 12 months for a series of damning financial scandals			1
the card was sent out to @entity8 employees in an attempt to generate some festive goodwill at the investment bank			0
it is a panorama that looks like a @entity48 advert and features @entity0 and his wife more than once , along with son - in - law @entity50 who is leaping into the air			2
after it was leaked onto the @entity52 , it quickly became an object of ridicule which some said showed how out of touch @entity0 was			2
in the photo @entity0 gleefully swings his tennis racket as his wife @entity15 , their three daughters and their dog laugh and look relaxed @entity62 host @entity61 said it was as if the @entity0 family were saying : ‘ hey , we ’re so rich we can destroy our own stuff ’ , whilst the @entity68 magazine said it was ‘ braggy and opulent ’ @entity67 said it was ‘ maddeningly tone - deaf ’ and comedian @entity71 joked that @entity0 committed a basic error and that his ‘ @entity3 card should have been him weeping alone on a pile of money clutching a sled ’			1
writing on salon , @entity78 said the message seemed to be : ‘ we play tennis in the house because we ’re transgressive and also we have billions of dollars and no accountability			0
’ in terms of his professional life , @entity0 would appear to have little to celebrate in 2013			2
in october @entity8 agreed a $ 13billion deal with the @entity37 government to end investigations into its selling of mortgage investments in the 2008 financial crisis			0
chariman and ceo of @entity1 @entity0 ( pictured ) earns $ 18.7 million a year during the negotiations @entity0 personally met with @entity37 attorney general @entity96 to thrash out a deal , under which the company admitted to making serious misrepresentations to the public			2
the fine is the biggest civil settlement with any single company in @entity37 history			0
only the month before @entity8 agreed to pay $ 920million to four @entity37 government agencies to settle an investigation into the ‘ @entity108 ’ scandal			0
being head of the company during this time has meant that @entity0 has become something of a hate figure for unions and left - wing critics			1
@entity115 , a senior adviser at @entity116 , a reputation - management firm , told @entity118 that he thought that @entity0 ’s @entity3 card was designed to show him as a family man			1
he said : ‘ the photo shows a surprising side of @entity0 many people would respect : creative , unconcerned with formality in his private life and able to enjoy his family even when under intense public scrutiny			0
‘ this does n’t look like a ruthless ceo			0
instead , it depicts a very human father and husband letting his hair down			0
’ the @entity0 family put out a @entity3 card every year but none so far have been so hubristic as the 2013 version			1
@entity8 has paid out more than $ 13billion in fines in the past 12 months for a series of damning financial scandals ( headquarters in @entity12 pictured )			0
