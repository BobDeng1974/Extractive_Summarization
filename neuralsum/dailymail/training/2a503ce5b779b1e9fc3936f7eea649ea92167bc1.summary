when @entity0 claimed that most of @entity2 ’s success under @entity3 was as a result of players he had signed it was easy to dismiss it as sour grapes from the @entity10			1
but did he have a point ? the spine of @entity3 ’s side which won the @entity17 last season was made up of @entity0 ’s men and while it should be noted that executive duo @entity19 and @entity20 have their say in recruitment , the arrivals since @entity0 ’s departure have hardly lit up the @entity23			1
here , @entity24 gives the verdict on each of @entity3 ’s acquisitions ahead of saturday ’s title showdown at @entity29			1
@entity2 manager @entity3 ( left ) and @entity30 hold the 2014 @entity17 trophy @entity3 is launched into the air by his @entity2 players after their @entity17 title triumph last season @entity0 ( left ) guided @entity2 to the title in 2012 , but the @entity10 was sacked the following season @entity37 : £ 30m - @entity38 at £ 30m , the @entity40 midfield enforcer did not come cheap			1
brought in to free up @entity30 he played a key role in @entity2 ’s title win last season as his covering presence gave his @entity45 team - mate the freedom to bang in a staggering 20 @entity17 goals			1
verdict : hit @entity37 did not come cheap at £ 30m but the @entity40 has proved a hit since his arrival at the @entity23 @entity51 : £ 20m - @entity52 an instant hit , @entity54 plundered a staggering 23 goals before the end of january			2
but a shoulder injury sparked a loss of form and he failed to hit the back of the net in the remainder of the campaign			0
after dropping below @entity65 in the pecking order he was loaned to @entity67 and may not be seen in the blue of @entity2 again			2
verdict : @entity69 @entity51 ( right ) made a big impression early on at @entity2 but he has since been loaned out to @entity67 @entity71 : £ 14.9m - @entity52 would appear to be liked more by his manager than the @entity2 fans			1
@entity71 has made 32 appearances already this season			2
in his 21 @entity17 matches he has provided six assists and often gets into good positions only to be let down by his final ball			0
verdict : miss @entity71 ( right ) has made 32 appearances for @entity2 this season but his final ball has been disappointing @entity81 : £ 4.2m - @entity82 struggled to adapt to the @entity17 following his switch from @entity84 and was ridiculed by pundits including the likes of @entity87			1
found his feet to strike up a solid partnership with @entity90 despite his advancing years and has remained a key man this year			0
verdict : hit @entity81 ( right ) struggled in his early days but has emerged as a defensive leader in the @entity2 side @entity95 : £ 12m - @entity96 the man known as @entity98 for his likeness to the @entity101 president is yet to convince the @entity23 electorate			1
too often his midfield partnership with @entity37 has looked lifeless and defensive			0
will benefit from the return of @entity30 and could still prove to be a shrewd bit of business but has done little to show he is better than @entity109 , the man he replaced			0
verdict : miss @entity95 ( left ) puts in a strong tackle on @entity113 's @entity112 at the @entity23 on saturday @entity114 : £ 40m - @entity96 fighting off competition from @entity29 the capture of the @entity117 defender was seen as a coup			2
a series of inconsistent performances have left fans scratching their heads as @entity114 struggles to adapt			0
at £ 40m the bedding - in process should not be taking this long			0
verdict : miss @entity114 ( left ) and @entity126 have both flattered to deceive in defence for @entity2 @entity126 : free - @entity128 the right back has struggled to dislodge @entity130 and has just six @entity17 appearances under his belt			1
although a free transfer , @entity2 had to offer him a better contract than @entity128 and he would appear to be an expensive understudy			0
verdict : miss @entity137 had a tough afternoon in goal as @entity2 crashed to shock @entity140 defeat by @entity113 on saturday @entity137 : £ 4.4m - @entity141 the @entity143 man , a @entity3 favourite from their time in @entity84 , was expected to provide real competition for @entity146			1
however , @entity148 ’s no 1 has not come under great pressure and against @entity113 on saturday in a rare start , @entity147 was jittery and at fault for the @entity155 side ’s opener			2
verdict : miss @entity3 ’s best bit of business has arguably been the acquisition for former @entity29 stalwart @entity159 @entity159 : free - @entity29 probably @entity3 ’s best bit of business , regardless of the questions over his move from @entity29			1
@entity164 has scored a number of key goals this season and has often provided a creative spark lacking in @entity2 ’s midfield			2
@entity3 was keen to stop his planned move to @entity171 and for good reason			0
verdict : hit @entity159 ( centre ) scored the late equaliser that salvaged a 1 - 1 draw against old club @entity29 in september @entity177 : £ 22m - @entity178 was dubbed the ' @entity179 ' after he arrived thanks to a number of mystery illnesses and injuries			0
has been given an opportunity to shine this season but has only shown glimpses of the talent that made him one of the hottest young properties in @entity190			0
verdict : miss @entity177 ( left ) has only shown shown glimpses of the talent since he signed from @entity178			0

@entity2 won the @entity17 under @entity3 last term
the spine of that side was made up of players signed by @entity0
some of the arrivals since @entity0 ’s departure have failed to *inspire*
@entity37 and @entity81 were great signings from @entity3
@entity71 , @entity114 , @entity126 and @entity137 *toiled*
@entity159 's signing has probably been @entity3 's best business
