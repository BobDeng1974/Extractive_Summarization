by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 20 march 2013 the @entity2 government is abandoning a legal battle to require that cigarette packs carry a set of large and often graphic warning labels depicting the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit			1
instead , the @entity10 will go back to the drawing board and create labels to replace those that included images of diseased lungs and the sewn - up corpse of a smoker , according to a letter from attorney general @entity19			1
the government had until monday to ask the @entity2 @entity20 to review an appeals court decision upholding a ruling that the requirement violated @entity25 free speech protections			1
graphic : the @entity2 government is abandoning a legal battle to require that cigarette packs carry a set of large and often graphic warning labels , like those pictured depicting the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit ' in light of these circumstances , the solicitor general has determined ... not to seek @entity20 review of the @entity25 issues at the present time , ' @entity19 wrote in a friday letter to house speaker @entity40 notifying him of the decision			1
some of the nation 's largest tobacco companies , including @entity44 , sued to block the mandate to include warnings on cigarette packs as part of the 2009 @entity49 that , for the first time , gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco			0
the nine labels originally set to appear on store shelves last year would 've represented the biggest change in cigarette packs in the @entity2 in 25 years			1
tobacco companies increasingly rely on their packaging to build brand loyalty and grab consumers â€” one of the few advertising levers left to them after the government curbed their presence in magazines , billboards and tv			0
they had argued that the proposed warnings went beyond factual information into anti-smoking advocacy			0
the government , however , argued the images were factual in conveying the dangers of tobacco , which is responsible for about 443,000 deaths in the @entity2 a year			1
drawing board : instead , the @entity10 will go back to the drawing board to create new labels , according to a letter from attorney general @entity19 , pictured the nine graphic warnings proposed by the @entity10 included color images of a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat , and a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a mother 's kiss			1
these were accompanied by assertions that smoking causes cancer and can harm fetuses			0
the warnings were to cover the entire top half of cigarette packs , front and back , and include the phone number for a stop - smoking hotline , 1 - 800 - quit - now			2
in a statement on tuesday , the @entity10 said it would ' undertake research to support a new rulemaking consistent with the @entity49			2
' the @entity10 did not provide a timeline for the revised labels			2
' although we pushed forcefully ... ( the ) ruling against the warning labels wo n't deter the @entity10 from seeking an effective and sound way to implement the law , ' dr. @entity106 , assistant secretary of the @entity107 , wrote in an blog post tuesday afternoon			1
@entity113 , a noted @entity25 lawyer who represented @entity114 in the challenge said he was n't surprised by the @entity117 's decision not to appeal			0
' the graphic warnings imposed by the @entity10 were constitutionally indefensible , ' he wrote in an @entity120 labels first appeared on @entity2 cigarette packs in 1965 , and current warning labels that feature a small box with text were put on cigarette packs in the mid- 1980s			1
factual : the government argued the images were factual in conveying the dangers of tobacco , which is responsible for about 443,000 deaths in the @entity2 a year ( stock photo ) the share of @entity2 who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970 , from nearly 40 percent to about 19 percent			2
but the rate has stalled since about 2004 , with about 45 million adults in the @entity2 smoking cigarettes			0
it 's unclear why it has n't budged , but some market watchers have cited tobacco company discount coupons on cigarettes and lack of funding for programs to discourage smoking or to help smokers quit			0
in recent years , more than 40 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those created by the @entity10			2
the @entity152 said in a survey done in countries with graphic labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 percent said the warnings led them to consider quitting			0
joining @entity162 - based @entity44 , owned by @entity163 , and @entity114 , owned by @entity114 , in the lawsuit were @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 @entity168 , @entity169 - based @entity170 , parent company of the nation 's largest cigarette maker , @entity171 , which makes the top - selling @entity174 brand , was not a part of the lawsuit			0
the case is separate from a lawsuit by several of the same tobacco companies over other marketing restrictions in the 2009 law			0
last march , a federal appeals court in @entity182 ruled that the law was constitutional			0
the companies in october petitioned the @entity2 @entity20 to review that case .			1

@entity10 will go back to the drawing board and create labels to replace those that included images of diseased lungs and the sewn - up corpse of a smoker
