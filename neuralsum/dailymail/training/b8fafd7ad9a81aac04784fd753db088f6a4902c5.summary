@entity0 dealt @entity1 a major blow last night by declaring he had ‘ lost ’ the election and refusing to tell her supporters to back him			1
the @entity9 president ’s hopes of clinging to power rely on picking up the votes of many of the six million who backed miss @entity15 ’s @entity14 in record numbers in the first round of the national poll			1
the strong showing for the @entity21 triggered alarm around @entity23 , while the prospect of mr @entity1 losing to socialist opponent @entity25 in the second round spooked financial markets			1
she refused to support him in the run - off economists fear mr @entity25 will unpick a @entity43 deal on fiscal union and shatter an uneasy consensus on the need for austerity measures across the continent			2
the political uncertainty in @entity9 , the world ’s fifth largest economy , helped trigger a sell - off on both sides of the @entity54			1
the @entity9 stock market fell by 2.83 per cent , @entity56 ’s by 3.36 per cent and @entity57 ’s by 1.85 per cent			1
@entity56 chancellor @entity58 yesterday expressed shock that nearly 20 per cent of @entity9 voters had gone for the @entity14			0
the alliance between @entity62 and @entity31 is key to the @entity23 project			0
defeat for mr @entity1 on may 6 would also be awkward for @entity65 , who broke with convention by publicly endorsing the @entity9 president			1
president in waiting ? @entity25 is favourite to defeat @entity1 in the run - off in two weeks time government sources said efforts would be made to extend an olive branch to the @entity9 socialists , with @entity23 minister @entity74 expected to be tasked with trying to strengthen links			1
‘ they are political allies , ’ a @entity77 source said of mr @entity1 and mr @entity65 , defending the prime minister ’s decision to back the @entity9 president			1
‘ but of course , if @entity25 ends up winning we will have to work with him			2
’ miss @entity15 ’s party won 18 per cent of the vote , its largest ever share , in sunday ’s first round , but yesterday her party said there would be no deal with the current president			2
she said : ‘ i do n’t expect anything except that the system will implode , ’ adding : ‘ @entity1 has already lost the presidential election			0
’ @entity94 , miss @entity15 ’s senior aide , said : ‘ there has to be reorganisation of @entity9 political life			2
‘ it ’s therefore out of the question for the @entity14 candidate to negotiate … or to offer her vote in favour of @entity1 or @entity25			2
@entity0 is convinced of that			0
’ pleased : @entity25 ( left ) waves as he arrives on the stage to give a speech after doing well in the first round of the votes , as @entity1 went out and about today ( right ) salute : @entity0 , @entity111 took third place in the first round of the votes a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ we shall be abstaining , because we do not want to give a green light to any of the two candidates , because they are the same ’			1
opinion polls have suggested that up to six in ten @entity15 voters could back mr @entity1 in the second round			1
mr @entity25 won 28.6 per cent and @entity1 took 27 per cent on sunday			1
mr @entity25 is now the favourite to win			2
if he does , he would become @entity9 ’s first socialist leader in 17 years			1
both contenders tried to tack to the right to try to appeal to voters who had backed miss @entity15			0
speaking at a rally in central @entity9 , mr @entity1 said he ‘ had heard ’ @entity15 ’s message and vowed to be tough on immigration			1
he said : ‘ @entity14 voters must be respected			0
it was a vote of suffering , a crisis vote			0
why insult them ? this anxiety , this suffering , i know them , i understand them			0
‘ they concern our borders , outsourcing , control of immigration , work , security , for them and their families			0
i know that in this fast - moving world , the concern of our patriots to preserve their way of life is the key issue in this election			0
’ in @entity150 , mr @entity25 said : ‘ my message ? we are a large country and we will recover – we have no need of divisions			2
’ @entity155 , his campaign director , said the @entity157 candidate would continue to be ‘ very open ’ to legal immigration , but ‘ we must fight with absolute firmness , without concession , against illegal immigration ’			0
far left candidate @entity162 , who came fourth with almost 12 per cent of the vote , has told his supporters to back mr @entity25			1
voilà ! @entity9 president @entity1 casts his vote in @entity31 in the first round of the elections while wife @entity168 looks on last week i hope you 're going to vote for me darling : @entity9 's first lady ms @entity168 has a final discussion with her husband , left , before casting her vote , right can he do it ? @entity25 emerges from a polling booth , left , and casts his vote , right , in @entity179 famous voters : disgraced former @entity182 chief @entity181 , left , votes in @entity184 , while right , former @entity9 president @entity186 's wife @entity185 is seen in a polling station in @entity188 in 2007 @entity1 inspired voters with pledges to break with the past and make @entity9 a more dynamic economy			1
but after an initial wave of reforms , his momentum fizzled			0
his stormy personal life got in the way : he divorced months into office , then quickly married former supermodel @entity168 , and became seen as a bling - bling president more concerned with pleasing his super-rich friends than serving the public			0
he enjoyed a string of foreign policy successes , improving relations with the @entity205 and @entity206 , leading an international airstrike campaign in @entity208 and rallying @entity23 partners to stem @entity23 's financial crisis			0
but voters at home felt forgotten and hurt by a presidency that included @entity9 's worst recession since @entity215 @entity25 , despite a bland persona and few eye - catching campaign ideas , has been more popular than @entity1 for months			1
@entity1 showed signs of a possible comeback once he hit the campaign trail			0
the shooting rampage in southern @entity9 also gave him a platform to appear presidential and project the tough guy image that helped launch him to national prominence			0
but in recent days his support has lagged again			0
the last polls before the election , released on friday , showed @entity1 slipping a few points behind @entity25 in the first round - and a crushing 10 to 15 points away from victory in the runoff .			2

@entity1 's *re-election* votes are pinned on winning votes of six million who backed @entity0 in first round
