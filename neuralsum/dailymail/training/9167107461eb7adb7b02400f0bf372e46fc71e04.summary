by @entity0 a teenage girl who was tricked into having sex with a woman who pretended to be a schoolboy today spoke of her outrage after learning her abuser had avoided prison			1
@entity8 , 26 , seduced two 15 - year - olds - but a judge ruled that she deserved a lenient sentence because she genuinely believed that she was in fact male			1
one of the victims , @entity14 , said she was ' devastated ' by the judgement , and warned that @entity16 could prey on others now that she is walking free			1
she was given three months of probation as well of community service during sentencing at the @entity20 in @entity21			2
fury : @entity14 is outraged after 26 - year - old @entity8 escaped jail for tricking her into sex by pretending to be a teenage boy @entity14 , now 18 , regarded @entity16 as her ' first love ' when they met , and allow the person she thought was a 16 - year - old boy to take her virginity			1
the victim , who has waived her right to anonymity in order to speak out , today said : ' i 'm absolutely devastated with the sentence @entity35 has been given			0
' she will be able to go back to her own house and lie in her own bed again			0
i will also be lying in mine , still trying to deal with what she has done to me			0
' i really hope the judge has really thought this sentence through because if @entity35 does this again , i hope he knows it 's on his conscience			1
' walking free : @entity8 , pictured outside court today , has been sentenced to probation for obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud @entity16 , from @entity49 , had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud			1
in 2008 , she posed as a 17 - year - old boy named @entity54 and had sexual relations with a teenage girl			1
' the complainer believed @entity16 to be a boy aged 17 years old , ' a lawyer said at a previous hearing			1
' there was sexual contact - initially , kissing and cuddling but things progressed over the course of the three months			2
' the girl broke off contact with @entity16 after seeing her passport , which was emailed to her by another girl			2
when @entity16 was later interviewed by police , she admitted having a relationship with the girl and presenting herself as a boy throughout , and accepted that she did not allow the girl to do anything to her that might disclose her gender			1
in 2010 , the defendant started a relationship with @entity14 , using a sex toy to persuade her she was a boy aged 16			1
‘ this was the complainer ’s first experience of what she thought had been sexual intercourse and both declared their love for each other , ' the lawyer said			2
' the complainer felt having had sex with the accused made their relationship stronger			2
‘ the complainer had what she believed to be sexual intercourse on one further conviction			0
again this intimacy was described to be under the covers so they did not see each other naked			0
’ @entity14 was devastated to be told by police that her ' boyfriend ' was actually an older woman			2
the court heard today that the 26 - year - old suffers from gender identity disorder , causing her to feel that she was born in the wrong body			1
fraud : she was sentenced at the @entity20 in @entity21 , but the judge expressed sympathy with her ' these are very unusual offences , ' @entity107 said during sentencing			0
' the case is clearly an exceptional one			0
' on @entity16 's disorder , he said : ' i accept that this leads you to genuinely feel you are male rather than female			1
this significantly lowers your culpability			0
' the judge added that although the offences were serious , ' having had regard to all the circumstances i believe they can be dealt with by an non-custodial sentence '			0
lord @entity107 acknowledged that there was no violence involved in the offences			0
he also accepted that @entity16 had not dressed as a boy solely to seduce the young girls , as she always wears masculine clothing			2
@entity16 was sentenced to a three - year probation order with an additional 240 hours ' community service			1
the @entity134 argued that people should not be prosecuted for concealing their gender			0
a spokesman said that criminalising gender fraud threatened the privacy of transgendered people and ' seriously undermined trans people 's trust in the @entity144 criminal justice system '			0
@entity145 , an @entity134 development worker , said : ' we understand that some people may be distressed when they become aware of the trans status of a partner or former partner			0
' but just in the same way that people are n't obliged to share other personal information with potential partners , for example that they are married or have criminal convictions , trans people should n't be forced to share private information about their gender history under fear of prosecution			0
