more @entity1 citizens signed up to fight in @entity2 and @entity3 than joined the @entity4 last year , it can be revealed			2
just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year - despite a @entity7 target to boost the stand - by force by 11,000 by 2018			1
but at the same time the brutal @entity10 inspired @entity12 forces tearing through @entity2 have been boosted by ' several hundred ' @entity13 , ministers told @entity15			1
ministers are increasingly concerned @entity1 - born recruits could return to the @entity1 intent on carrying out attacks in the @entity1 terror experts believe there could be as many as 500 brits fighting alongside the jihadists in the @entity27 for @entity12 ( @entity28 in @entity2 and @entity3 )			1
a senior government minister said : ‘ there is a real problem about people going in and being radicalised and then coming home			2
there are several hundred who have gone from @entity1 that we know of			1
' to get to @entity2 most of them will have to go through @entity3 , so the two are connected			2
’ foreign secretary @entity41 yesterday admitted @entity42 will ' inevitably ' be fighting alongside @entity12 which he called the ' most violent and brutal militant group in the @entity27 '			1
he said the majority of @entity12 ' members were @entity2 or @entity3 but ' it also includes a significant number of foreign fighters among its ranks '			2
mr @entity41 said : ' as i have previously told this @entity52 , we estimate the number of @entity1 - linked individuals fighting in @entity3 to include approximately 400 @entity1 nationals and other @entity1 - linked individuals who could present a particular risk should they return to the @entity1			1
' he said ' some of these , inevitably ' are ' fighting with ' @entity12			1
shadow defence secretary @entity58 said he revelation was humiliating for the country and needed to be tackled			2
mr @entity58 said : ' the government 's own figures show more @entity1 citizens are joining @entity12 than signing up for the @entity64			1
this is shameful , embarrassing and will cause deep concern			1
' we need to see action to ensure recruitment to the @entity64 meets the targets set			2
otherwise , @entity1 will be left with a dangerous capability gap			0
' the government has launched a campaign to recruit 11,000 new reservists to boost the size of the back - up force to 30,000 by 2018			1
but between april 2013 and april 2014 just 170 signed up shadow defence secretary @entity58 ( centre ) , with @entity79 leader @entity78 on a surprise visit to @entity81 earlier this year , attacked the ' shameful ' failure to recruit @entity1 forces for the @entity4 in the whole of 2013 the number of @entity86 reservists actually fell by 50 to just 19,150 at the start of the year			1
over the 12 months to april this year – a period during in which the government claimed recruitment had improved – the number of reservists in @entity1 increased by just 170			1
the @entity86 's stalling recruitment drive comes despite a pledge to raise the numbers of reservists to 30,000 by 2018			1
the @entity98 has insisted it was confident the target would be met - as part of plans to slash the size of the @entity104 from 102,000 in 2010 to 82,000 in 2018			0
but this would require an extra 2,750 reservists a year to be recruited			1
the @entity98 said : ' although there have been a number of technical challenges , the programme is on track and the @entity64 are now growing in size for the first time in 18 years			0
' foreign affairs select committee member @entity114 said it was ' shocking and very worrying ' that more @entity1 citizens were prepared to risk their lives fighting alongside terrorists in the @entity27 than had signed up for the @entity4			1
foreign secretary @entity41 , speaking in the @entity120 yesterday , said it was ' inevitable ' that @entity13 were fighting alongside @entity12 forces in @entity2 and suggested 400 had travelled to the @entity27 to join the battle against president @entity124 in some capacity he said : ' there are clearly a pool of people who are being recruited by these extremist groups through the internet			1
it is very serious and we have got to be very tough on it			0
' these figures show there is a minority of people who are fanatical and prepared to join extremist groups , but also that the government 's recruitment to the @entity141 is not going very well at all			2
' there are large numbers living in this country going to fight for these vile terrorist organisations and that 's very worrying , particularly if they are returning to @entity1 having seen what they have seen and looking to recruit terrorists back here			0
' the revelation comes after former prime minister @entity151 said @entity1 fighters returning from @entity2 and @entity3 were the government 's single , biggest security concern			2
mr @entity151 said : ' if we do n't deal with the @entity3 issue then the problems are not just going to be for @entity3 and for the region , the problems are actually going to come back and they are going to hit us very directly even in our own country			0
' he added : ' if you talk to security services in @entity164 and @entity165 and the @entity1 , they will tell you their biggest single worry today returning jihadists fighters - our own citizens by the way - from @entity3			0
' @entity169 , an expert at the anti-extremist think tank , @entity170 , said the number of @entity13 signing up to fight in the @entity27 would only grow			1
he said : ' people are going from @entity1 and the @entity174 to fight for @entity12 - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will probably rise			0
' if you want to go and fight jihad , @entity12 , which holds a particularly extreme view of @entity179 and wants to create an extreme @entity179 utopia , is a very attractive group to fight for			0
' while the @entity183 has struggled to attract recruits , the brutal @entity12 insurgency in @entity2 has been bolstered by ' several hundred ' @entity1 - born fighters			2
an image emerged over the weekend allegedly showing @entity12 militants executing dozens of captured @entity2 security forces members			0
@entity1 security services fear @entity12 recruits will return to the @entity1 scarred by their experience in @entity2 the @entity10 inspired @entity12 terror group has carved out an area of control across the middle east , threatening to tear apart the current national borders			0
a senior government minister told @entity15 the route into @entity2 for many @entity13 was through war - ravaged @entity3 , to the west @entity202 's official spokesman has acknowledged fears @entity1 citizens could be among the @entity12 fighters in @entity2 , saying : ' our security services and all the relevant agencies will be monitoring those types of risks very closely			1
' clearly there is a very porous border between parts of @entity3 and parts of @entity2			0
' as the prime minister has said , the greatest extremist activity and jihadist threats to the international community are in @entity3			0
we need to keep these things under very close watch			0
' @entity222 and security minister @entity223 , meanwhile , has warned any brits considering joining the battle abroad that they will face jail in @entity1 for any terror - related offences - even if they are carried out abroad			0
he said : ' the @entity228 would extend the reach of the @entity230 so that @entity1 - linked individuals and those who seek to harm @entity1 interests , who travel overseas to prepare or train more generally for terrorism , can be prosecuted as if their actions had taken place in the @entity1			0
' a @entity239 spokesman has previously added : ' people who are thinking about travelling to @entity3 to engage in terrorist activity should be in no doubt that we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security , including prosecuting those who break the law			0
' @entity15 approached the @entity98 about the revelations , but has not received any response .			0

several hundred @entity13 thought to be fighting in @entity27 killing fields
but just 170 recruited as reservists in 12 months to april despite hiring push
figures ' shameful , embarrassing and will cause deep concern ' say *mps*
