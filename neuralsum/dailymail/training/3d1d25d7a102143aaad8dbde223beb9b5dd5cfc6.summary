as the four remaining teams in this year ’s @entity2 prepare for battle with a place in the final at stake , there is one war that has already been won ... by adidas			2
more than half of the players expected to start in the semi-finals will be wearing boots made by the @entity14 sportswear giant			2
those adidas players include @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity20 and their 26 players lead rivals @entity22 , who have 15 sporting the famous swoosh , while only two players will walk out in @entity27 boots at the semi-final stage			1
and one , @entity31 's @entity30 , wearing @entity32			1
@entity48 , @entity17 and @entity49 will all take to the field in adidas ’ new @entity2 range			1
@entity16 even has his own design - the @entity54			0
wearing the same boots as the four - time @entity56 does n’t come cheap , though , at the cost of £ 170			2
@entity31 ’s quarter - final hero @entity58 leads the way for @entity22 along with team - mates @entity60 and @entity62			1
the centre - half , whose boot took the hosts to the last four with a spectacular 30 - yard free - kick , will be lacing up his @entity68 once again in tuesday 's clash with @entity42 in @entity70			0
@entity22 ’s newest boot , developed especially for the @entity2 , has a sock - like second skin to improve durability and provide an almost barefoot feel			1
emulating the former @entity77 man ’s choice of footwear will set you back £ 255 , though			0
eight of @entity42 ’s expected starting line - up will be wearing adidas , including @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
in the other semi-final , six of the eleven players for @entity43 will be wearing adidas boots			1
amid the players wearing adidas is acrobatic goalkeeper @entity93 , energetic winger @entity94 and , of course , arguably one of the finest players to have ever graced the game , @entity16			1
four of the 11 players for the @entity100 giants will be wearing @entity22 , including world - class full - back @entity101 and midfield maestro @entity103			2
@entity27 icon @entity104 will be wearing the rather vibrant @entity106 boots which have unsurprisingly caught the eye of many football fans			0
@entity109 : @entity48 will take to the pitch with his @entity42 team - mates wearing his adidas boots crunch time : @entity48 will line up with @entity42 to take on the host nation @entity31 on tuesday the two super-brands have been going head - to - head for nearly 60 years , and are the equivalent of @entity43 vs @entity31			1
@entity119 and @entity120 may be team - mates at @entity122 but they are enemies in terms of branding			0
@entity119 being with @entity22 , and @entity120 with adidas			0
@entity20 , though , also have @entity126 superstar @entity16 on their side			0
a few marketable footballers ... @entity119 ( @entity22 ) @entity16 ( @entity20 ) @entity129 ( @entity22 ) @entity130 ( @entity20 ) @entity131 ( @entity22 ) @entity132 ( @entity22 ) @entity133 ( @entity22 ) @entity134 ( @entity20 ) @entity135 ( @entity22 ) @entity136 ( @entity27 ) in this particular squad , @entity22 have been overshadowed by the new batch of boots made by adidas - in fact , four of the players likely to start will be wearing boots inside the @entity144			1
this connotes that the new range of adidas boots is more successful than the new @entity68 ’s , both of which were previously unveiled before the @entity2 commenced			0
the boot encounter concerning the @entity44 squad conveys a very comparable story			0
although this time it is even more disproportionate as eight of the expected starting eleven will be wearing adidas boots on the fateful night			2
this includes the likes of the outstanding @entity17 and the magnificent @entity157 both having used their flamboyant footwear to help their team progress			0
the two stars both wear the adidas f50 @entity164 boots - part of the @entity40 range			1
just three of the @entity44 expected line - up will be wearing @entity22 , which is a very disappointing statistic for the company			0
@entity169 will be showing off his @entity170 ’s as well as @entity171 and @entity172 , who will be wearing their @entity174 ’s , but adidas is sure to gain more publicity with eight out of the 11 players wearing their boots			0
that leaves @entity181 defender @entity180 , one of the few who will be wearing @entity27 , and powerful winger @entity30 , who represents the @entity32 brand			2
oops ! @entity184 would have been wearing his adidas boots but crashed out in spectacular fashion @entity187 : scroll to the bottom of the page for a full breakdown of each and every boot in the semi-finals			0

@entity20 come out on top with 26 players in @entity2 semi-finals compared to @entity22 's 15 , @entity27 's two and @entity32 's one
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity49 among those wearing adidas
@entity31 have most **expensive** xi in terms of boots , costing £ *1,725*
@entity42 's @entity207 and @entity31 's @entity58 wear most **expensive** boots - @entity208 - at £ 255 a pair
@entity31 the only team to have more players sporting @entity22 than adidas
