this is the moment a fearless guard dog took on a giant polar bear more than twice its size and won by scaring it away			1
the huge bear approached the working dog , who is used to pull sleds through the snow in @entity10 , @entity11			2
but rather than running away in fear , the determined dog stood its ground by baring its teeth and growling at the polar animal in a startled frenzy			0
but eventually the bear , who is considerably larger than the dog , was forced to make a retreat and trudge away into the distance from the fiery animal			2
the incredible moment was captured on camera by photographer @entity46 while he was visiting @entity47 in @entity11 earlier this month			1
despite their differences in size , the dog continues to stand its ground rather than running away from the bear in fear the dog begins to bare its teeth as well as barking and growling as the polar bear gets closer and the two animals square up to each other the dog 's owner claims that he breeds the strongest dogs in the world and they sometimes do throw themselves at the bears to scare them off he revealed that the fearless dog was also chained up to stop it from escaping and went into survival mode when he saw the bear approaching			1
