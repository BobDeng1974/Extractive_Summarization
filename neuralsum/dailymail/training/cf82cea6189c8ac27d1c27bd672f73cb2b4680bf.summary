@entity40 said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family			0
' i 'd say most of my sadness centers around how much i wanted a family , ' @entity40 told @entity218			0
' and it feels like for me , that was always , like , how you created a legacy was , like , through your children			0
and sort of inadvertently - through sharing my story , i 've realized there 's a bit of the legacy i 'm creating this way and i 'm not ashamed of that			2
i 'm not ashamed to attach my name to what i think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill @entity63			0
' ' i do n't want to die , ' @entity40 explained			0
' if anyone wants to hand me , like , a magical cure and save my life so that i can have children with my husband , you know , i will take them up on it			2
' she also has made a deal with her mother , @entity242 , that if she travels to @entity244 in @entity245 after her passing , @entity4 ’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking @entity248 ruins			2
