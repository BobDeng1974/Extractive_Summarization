i do n't know who to blame , and i really do n't care who 's to blame , ' @entity9 told news 3			1
' i have spent countless hours on the phone trying to get this resolved			0
i have contacted and pleaded with elected officials to help and was told i may have to sue to get this resolved			0
what kind of answer is that ? ' the first problem for @entity9 was that the health plan he was quoted came in at nearly $ 1,600 a month - far higher than the existing @entity54 plan he had been using			2
in december , he claims , a payment he made was lost , and in january his insurance group , @entity58 , could not find any record for @entity9 's children after they had doctor appointments which meant the couple had to cover the cost themselves			1
unexpected : the problems coverage coincided with @entity21 giving birth to the couple 's fifth child			1
