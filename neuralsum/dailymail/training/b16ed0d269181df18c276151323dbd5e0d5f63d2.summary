by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 03:15 est , 9 november 2012 @entity2 did not sack his defence minister because of a multi-million - pound corruption scandal but because he was cheating on his wife - the daughter of one of the @entity9 president 's closest allies , it has been claimed			1
mr @entity2 announced on tv yesterday that he had fired @entity11 , 50 , saying he had become a liability due to a probe into the sale of ministry assets at suspiciously low prices			1
but rumours are fast spreading through @entity9 media that the real reason the former furniture salesman lost his job was because of an extra-marital affair that infuriated his powerful father - in - law and patron , @entity23 , former @entity9 prime minister , now chairman of oil monopoly @entity25			0

@entity33 was reported on tuesday to have left the country			0
@entity46 , an influential anti-corruption blogger and opposition politician , wrote a post in which he said @entity11 had broken one of @entity2 's most cherished unspoken rules that ' you must honour your family '			0
mr @entity11 's replacement in a job which had been long eyed by rivals , former emergencies minister @entity57 , 57 , is untainted by corruption and popular among @entity9			1
close friends : rumours are spreading that the real reason @entity11 lost his job was because of an extra-marital affair that infuriated his powerful father - in - law and patron , @entity23 , ( pictured ) former @entity9 prime minister and close ally of @entity2 ( in background ) mr @entity57 has also proved immensely loyal and shown few signs of political ambitions in nearly two decades in senior posts			1
mr @entity2 's announcement made at a meeting with mr @entity57 appeared designed to show he will crack down on high - level corruption in his new , six - year presidential term			0
‘ taking into consideration the situation around the @entity84 , in order to create conditions for an objective investigation into all matters , i have decided to free defence minister @entity11 of his post , ’ @entity2 said , sitting across the table from mr @entity57 at a state residence outside @entity31			1

@entity9 investigators raided the offices of @entity84 firm @entity112 last month and opened a probe into the company on suspicion that it had sold assets to commercial firms at a loss of 3billion roubles ( £ 60million )			2
@entity11 ( right ) , a one - time furniture salesman , owed much of his career to the influence of his father - in - law @entity23 , a former prime minister and trusted associate of mr @entity2			2
mr @entity11 's control over @entity9 's arms budget had earned him enemies among ambitious @entity130 figures , including deputy prime minister @entity131 who oversees the country 's defence industry , government sources say			1
his military reforms , which reorganised troops , cut the number of officers by more than 100,000 and exposed high level corruption , also made him disliked in the ranks			0
however , his alleged role in helping to dismantle the assets of jailed former oil tycoon @entity142 while he still worked in the tax office had led many analysts to believe mr @entity11 was untouchable and would weather the scandal			0

although the @entity9 authorities were criticised in 2010 over forest fires that caused @entity31 to suffer for weeks under smoke and toxic fumes , his loyalty to mr @entity2 and a background untainted by corruption have done him well			0
‘ @entity57 is unknown in our country as a great strategist or as a powerful military officer , but that is not needed in the post of the minister of defence , ’ said @entity155 , a military analyst at the @entity156			2
‘ if the defence minister is largely an administrative post , then @entity57 has very great merits , ' he added			0
' as an administrator he is already regarded very highly and moreover , he is popular in @entity9 and in social opinion			0
