yet it is the grainy cctv images of @entity3 , who was gunned down in a car park following an argument about his unfortunate own goal at the 1994 @entity10 , that have spurred on @entity27 's team			1
scroll down to watch @entity28 pay tribute to @entity3 remembered : @entity30 , brother of @entity3 , attends a memorial service in @entity32 on wednesday gone but not forgotten : @entity6 defender @entity3 , pictured here during the 1994 @entity10 , was murdered after returning from the tournament horror moment : @entity3 diverted the ball beyond his own goalkeeper @entity37 during a defeat to hosts the @entity40 in @entity41 @entity42 pay tribute to @entity3 the image of @entity28 football is a blur of colour and adventure , combined with the murky underworld of drug cartels and gangland killings			1
even @entity52 , the @entity10 's leading goalscorer , emerged from a shadowy start at @entity54 , a club just outside @entity32			1
eight years ago , drug trafficker @entity56 , the owner of @entity54 and an influential figure in @entity52 's early development , was murdered at his home			2
here @entity6 are trying to move on from their past and show the world that their football has some of the brightest talent in the game			1
the country 's president , @entity67 , is flying in for the match and he has declared a half - day holiday for the country 's 48m people			2
even @entity74 football has an affinity with @entity6 's past , from goalkeeper @entity78 's famous scorpion kick at @entity79 in 1995 to @entity81 's antics at @entity82 and @entity83 and that unruly mop of hair			1
@entity27 's team cruised through the group stages before @entity52 helped knock out @entity88			2

' if they are comparing me to him at the end of my career , that 's when i will be extremely happy			0
he has done a lot for our country and he is a very good guy			0
but i have not proved myself at international level yet			0
if i can do that this summer and put a smile on his face , along with all the other @entity28 , i will be very happy			0
' all smiles : @entity52 ( centre ) has helped the current @entity6 team reach the quarter - finals in @entity18 leading the way : manager @entity27 and his team have helped @entity6 fall in love with football again the stadium is sold out and beating @entity18 , for the first time since a 2 - 0 group win in the @entity145 in 1991 , would be something special			1

' i remember @entity156 scoring against @entity157 ( in 1998 )			0
it was huge for the country but of course it did n't end well			0

' our coach has got us playing and fighting for each other , and for @entity6 , ' said @entity52 , who has been recognised as one of the most talented young midfielders in the world			1
' it 's nice to hear others say they think i am going well , especially when it comes from coaches and players			0
i use it as a positive but i do n't let it give me a big head			0
