by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 11 january 2013 @entity1 was forced to quit as chief whip over claims he called police ' plebs ' , something he always denied cabinet secretary sir @entity7 came under fire from @entity9 yesterday after admitting he had been ‘ too busy ’ to conduct a proper inquiry into the so - called ‘ @entity12 ’ incident			1
@entity13 asked @entity15 ’s top mandarin to investigate the affair last september , in which the former @entity18 chief whip swore at a policeman at the gates of @entity22			2
he was drafted in after an off - duty policeman claimed in an email to his local mp that he witnessed the incident and supported the allegations of two officers that @entity1 had been aggressive towards them and called them plebs			0
sir @entity7 admitted having suspicions that mr @entity1 might have been the victim of a ‘ gigantic conspiracy ’ by the police but decided to do nothing about it			1
and he admitted he had not even sought to ascertain whether mr @entity1 used the word plebs , as police claimed			2
sir @entity7 said he concluded the email was unreliable and there were ‘ inconsistencies ’ between the email and @entity42 footage of the incident but he did n’t bother to look at the police log , published as he began his inquiry , and said he ‘ ca n’t recall ’ whether a note by the prime minister ’s principal private secretary , who interviewed the officers on duty , had contained the word pleb			1
‘ i did n’t look at whether the word pleb was used , ’ he said			0
‘ i have n’t attempted to assess the veracity of the police account against the @entity42 footage			0
’ sir @entity7 said he was ‘ mildly suspicious ’ of the email but failed to uncover the truth			1
asked whether the police were guilty of a ‘ massive fabrication ’ , he said : ‘ we accepted there were unanswered questions including the possibility of a gigantic conspiracy			0
‘ but we decided , on balance , to let matters rest , decided to stick by @entity1 , keep him in post and move on			0
’ sir @entity7 recommended that mr @entity13 support mr @entity1 , but the crucial @entity42 footage which might have exonerated the chief whip was not published until after mr @entity1 had been forced to resign			1
he left the @entity69 astonished at his failure to probe apparent lies by diplomatic protection squad members			0
cabinet secretary sir @entity7 admitted he had not investigated whether mr @entity1 used the word ' plebs ' sir @entity7 sought to defend himself against the charge of incompetence by repeatedly saying it was ‘ not in my remit ’ to look at the police log			1
he claimed : ‘ it ’s not my job to investigate the police			0
i do n’t have the powers , i do n’t have the expertise , i do n’t have the time			0
’ he also admitted routinely ignoring public complaints about ministers			0
but @entity9 , including committee chairman @entity88 , told sir @entity7 he should have referred the case to the @entity90 or sir @entity91 , who is supposed to probe ministerial wrongdoing			1
a report by @entity9 , due out next week , is expected to condemn @entity96 ’s handling of the affair			2
mr @entity88 told sir @entity7 : ‘ you were n’t asked to get to the bottom of it , you did n’t think it was your obligation to get to the bottom of it and because of your failure to get to the bottom of it , the government lost its chief whip			1
’ a friend of mr @entity1 said : ‘ for @entity7 to say it was n’t in his remit is risible			2
he ’s the cabinet secretary			1
he tells @entity13 what to do			0

cabinet secretary sir @entity7 defends handling of inquiry
admits he only looked at emails and cctv but did not check if toxic word was used
@entity9 question if he should have *headed* probe into *row* in @entity22
