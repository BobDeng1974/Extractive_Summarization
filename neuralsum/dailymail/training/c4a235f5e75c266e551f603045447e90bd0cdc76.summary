by @entity0 many scientific discoveries - especially those made in relation to our vast universe - are immediately heralded as amazing			1
but two astronomers have admitted they find the universe ' disappointing ' after discovering it is smoother and flatter than first thought and have even compared it to an underwhelming holiday			1
nonetheless , their research challenges the widely accepted cosmological model of the universe and could lead to a rethink of what it is made of and how it evolved into the stars and galaxies we see today			1
two astronomers have admitted they find the universe disappointing after discovering it is smoother and flatter than first thought			1
they studied distribution of hot gas associated with galaxy clusters in two supercomputer simulations with different cosmological models ( pictured ) astronomers professor @entity30 and dr @entity31 from @entity33 @entity32 were comparing recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation and galaxy clusters in two independent studies when they found the universe is flatter and smoother than previously thought			1
professor @entity30 said : ‘ have you ever booked a holiday to @entity41 expecting to trek the @entity43 mountain ranges only to be disappointed by ending up walking the flat countryside of @entity45 ? ‘ similar disappointment was felt when dr @entity31 and i conducted an experiment to measure the number of large massive clumps in the @entity52 , called clusters of galaxies			1
’ he explained that in some ways the findings were ‘ a discouragement ’ but they persevered anyway			2
‘ science is at its most interesting when prediction and experiment disagree and so although our cosmic landscape is smoother than we thought , this may mean we need to re-think bits of our cosmological theory and such progress is good for science in the long run			2
‘ although the perceived wisdom was that we would find lots of big clusters , in fact , when we looked , the @entity52 did not live up to our expectation and we found far fewer of these really huge structures than expected			2
’ sorry @entity41 ! professor @entity30 compared the discovery to an underwhelming holiday in the @entity76 ( pictured )			1
' similar disappointment was felt when dr @entity31 and i conducted an experiment to measure the number of large massive clumps in the @entity52 , called clusters of galaxies , ' he said cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the @entity85 of how the @entity52 was formed			2
in 1965 scientists discovered the electro - magnetic waves that bombard the @entity88 continuously from all directions at harmless microwave frequencies			0
the radiation that arrives at our planet has been cooled to only 2.7 ° c above absolute zero as it traverses deep space as the universe expands , meaning that in the distant past the temperature would have been much hotter			2
this led scientists to conclude that the universe had a hot origin – the so - called @entity102 – nearly 14 billion years ago			1
to measure the temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation , the @entity104 satellite was launched in 2009 by the @entity107 ( @entity107 )			0
it found that the tiny fluctuations in temperature slowly grow over time , eventually forming the stars and galaxies we see today			0
cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the @entity85 of how the @entity52 was formed because the radiation began its journey when the universe was only 380,000 years old , these measurements provide vital information about its composition			2
the cosmic census provided by @entity104 is remarkably precise , giving scientists accurate estimates of the age of the universe – which is thought to be 13.82 billion years old - and the amount of dark matter and dark energy			1
the universe is thought to be almost 32 per cent dark matter and 68 per cent dark energy			1
interestingly , it has been found that @entity104 is also sensitive to the largest gravitationally bound structures called clusters , which contain thousands of individual galaxies and large amounts of dark matter			0
and it has found fewer clusters than predicted based on the cosmic background radiation cosmological analysis			0
professor @entity30 and dr @entity31 ’s studies confirm the ‘ @entity104 - cluster problem ’ which says that there are many fewer massive clusters in the universe than expected			1
‘ we already knew that the number of clusters found by the satellite was lower than expected and we have now tested this by analysing a new carefully constructed independent survey of some 1,000 clusters over a large area of the sky using x-rays rather than microwave radiation , ’ professor @entity30 explained			0
‘ our findings confirm that the number of clusters is about a factor of two below the prediction based on the @entity104 cosmic background radiation analysis			1
’ in a separate study , dr @entity31 and his phd student @entity164 examined the detailed statistical properties of the cosmic background radiation and arrived at the same conclusion			0
explorer of the cosmos : the @entity104 satellite ( pictured ) was launched in 2009 by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) to measure the temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation , which holds the key to unlocking the secrets of how the universe formed cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the @entity85 of how the @entity52 was formed			0

dr @entity31 said : ‘ we ’ve taken a completely different approach to previous studies , by comparing the predictions of state - of - the - art supercomputer simulations with the results of sophisticated statistical analyses of the cosmic background radiation			0
‘ the comparison itself is quite straightforward and avoids any potential issues having to do with identifying clusters and measuring their masses			0
’ the discrepancy in the predicted and observed number of massive clusters strongly suggests that either the detailed survey by @entity104 is not correct , or else that the model itself is flawed in some way			2
if the model is flawed , one exciting possibility is that the deficit of galaxy clusters is pointing to an important contribution to the energy budget – or composition - of the universe by massive neutrinos , which are ghostly particles that weakly interact with normal matter			1
particle physicists have long argued that neutrinos may have non-zero mass , but laboratory experiments have only managed to place relatively weak bounds on what the size of the mass is			0
dr @entity31 plans on carrying out large - scale simulations that include the effects of massive neutrinos on cluster formation .			0

astronomers studied the distribution of hot gas associated with galaxy clusters to come to their conclusion
they compared their findings that the universe if flatter than thought to an underwhelming @entity43 holiday
their research challenges the widely accepted model of the universe and could lead to a rethink of what it is made of and how it evolved
