you are a modern - day @entity7			1
' @entity66 and @entity9 even stole one victim 's make - up bag worth an estimated £ 100 - but far less second hand police initially questioned the pair about two burglaries but using the latest forensic techniques , they linked @entity28 and @entity9 to a string of other crimes			1
detective sergeant @entity76 , of the @entity70 , said : ' @entity28 and @entity9 were a prolific burgling duo who committed a vast number of residential burglaries over a relatively short period of time			2
' they were clearly committing burglary for financial gain , but also stole some strange items such as a tin of mackerel , women 's make - up and a duvet set , suggesting they were actually using victims ' personal property to furnish their home and their lifestyles			1
' the jail sentence reflects the scale of their offending and will provide them with plenty of time to reflect on the dozens of victims who continue to suffer the effects of having been targeted by thieves			0
' i would like to thank @entity103 of the @entity70 and @entity105 @entity104 of @entity106 who both led their respective strands of the operation with tenacity and determination			0

' chief inspector @entity123 of the @entity70 added : " this represents a fantastic result for the team and highlights the benefits of @entity128 working together to combat serious crime			0
' the effects of becoming a victim of burglary run far deeper than a loss of property			0
' i hope that the sentences bring a measure of closure to the vast number of people victimised by these criminals			0
