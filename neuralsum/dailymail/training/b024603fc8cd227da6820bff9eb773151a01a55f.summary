in 1901 , he was captain of the @entity39 when he and his crew transported troops to @entity41 during the @entity42 for which he was awarded a special @entity44			2
however , there were warning signs of what was to come later when the white - whiskered skipper was captaining the @entity49 when she collided with @entity52 warship @entity50 in 1911			2
following the collision , the ship 's propeller was badly damaged and the vessel had to be returned to port			0

he has also been criticised for allowing lifeboats to leave the ship only partially filled			0
but there are also tales of his behaviour during the evacuation which cast him in a more favourable light			0
aside from tales of helping children into lifeboats , it is believed he was last seen in the bridge area having given the final order to abandon ship , before he died at the helm			0
