@entity1 is still the bravest player i 've seen ... he changed football @entity1 , @entity4 and sir @entity5 all make my team of the sixties @entity8 joins @entity9 and @entity10 in my team of the fifties @entity13 is one of the game ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
here , in the latest extract from his fascinating book , he reveals the clamour for @entity20 's signature and charts the beginning of @entity24 football 's influx of foreign talent			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
clearing out the garage the other day , i found a pair of my dad ’s old boots			2
it ’s a wonder players from the 50s could run at all ! metal toecaps , studs banged in the bottom with the nails coming through the sole			1
how could you have had any feel for a football with a set of those on ? i ’d love to organise a game one day			1
get 22 top players together , the stars of the @entity45 , put them in the old equipment and see how they coped			1
now that would be interesting			2
in the @entity50 , there were two kinds of surface , rock hard or mud heap			2
so it was unbelievable , really , to show the skill that the @entity57 team demonstrated in that gear			1
@entity57 were superb in the @entity50 , especially on the surface ... i 'd like to see @entity45 players try ! @entity62 players train at the @entity64 health centre during hot weather on a dry pitch @entity68 's @entity8 training after being selected for @entity70 's under 23 team spurs were a ' push and run ' team , i would compare them to the modern @entity72 they were the ‘ push and run ’ team			1
it is hard to explain their significance to a younger generation , but i would compare them to the modern @entity72 , the way their game was all about short passing and movement			1
it was n’t quite as sophisticated , obviously			2
what they called push and run back then is now known as the one - two and every team does it			2
but at the time it was revolutionary			2
my dad , also called @entity13 , loved @entity91 , but football was n’t as tribal then as it is now , so @entity93 was n’t our only destination			1
@entity97 ’s ground , @entity98 , was another haunt , and coming from @entity100 we would wait at the entrance of the @entity102 for a lift across the river			2
eventually a car would stop and we ’d jump in			0
in those days , people were friendlier and more trusting			0
they were going to football , we were going to football , so we all went together			0
@entity93 and @entity98 ( pictured ) were the normal grounds for me as a youngster an @entity91 vs @entity68 programme , 1958 - the @entity112 last ever game few people wore colours in those days			1
i remember my mum knitted me a red and white scarf for when i went to @entity91 , but there were no replica shirts or club merchandise			0
my dad even used to put on a collar and tie to go to some games			0
i saw the last game the @entity112 played in this country , a 5 – 4 win at @entity91 on february 1 , 1958 , and that would have stuck in my mind even without @entity128			1
it was a fantastic game , such incredible quality , and the next i heard was a radio bulletin saying @entity68 ’s plane had crashed on the way back from @entity135			1
@entity136 always had the radio on : the @entity138 , @entity139 and the news , and that ’s where i heard about @entity68 and @entity8			1
i ’d kept a scrapbook and i ’m sure there is a picture from a newspaper in it of @entity8 sitting up in his hospital bed : he was going to be all right			1
sadly , his condition worsened and he died			1
by the time i was 11 , i was being scouted by professional clubs , so we used to get offered a lot of tickets			0
then we could take our pick of matches			0
@entity159 of the pile for my dad was when @entity162 was in town , playing for @entity164			0
in one game @entity162 played for @entity70 , @entity166 captain @entity165 walked off the field and demanded to be replaced because he was so tired of being given the run - around			2
@entity70 won 10 – 0			0
@entity8 , pictured with manager @entity169 , was my idol as a child @entity1 is still the bravest player i 've seen ... he changed football @entity1 , @entity4 and sir @entity5 all make my team of the sixties @entity8 joins @entity9 and @entity10 in my team of the fifties where are poor @entity178 's friends now he needs their help ? @entity20 had @entity62 stars standing and applauding at 15 ... then he signed for @entity181 ! @entity182 reminded me of @entity4 , that 's why he 's in my team of the @entity185 @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 make my team of the @entity190 @entity191 would have solved @entity70 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity194 heralded a change ... he introduced @entity196 and scouting reports to @entity70 @entity198 has the class of @entity200 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity203 and @entity204 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while on tv ! why @entity13 fears that the @entity24 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity203 nearly crossed @entity210 to join @entity57 ... and @entity211 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity45 killed all that ! @entity217 's @entity219 interviews @entity13 about his new book the @entity70 and @entity68 man died along with many team - mates in the @entity128 air disaster , 1958 another stand - out player was goalkeeper @entity225 , who perhaps is the best example of how the game has changed			1
he was the first foreign star in @entity24 football , who came here as a @entity231 prisoner of war , and stayed			0
i ’m not sure that could happen now			0
i think it would be too horrible for him			0
he ’d been a member of the @entity236 , a @entity238 paratrooper , and had fought on the eastern front in @entity240			0
he was captured and sent to a prisoner - of - war camp in @entity242 , and when the war was over he ended up playing for @entity244 in the @entity245			0
when @entity247 , who was @entity248 ’s goalkeeper , contracted @entity249 and they went in for @entity225 , there were huge protests at first , particularly among the @entity252 community , until the chief rabbi of @entity254 came out in his defence			1
@entity225 was another stand - out player , and is a great example of how the game has changed he came to @entity70 as a @entity231 prisoner of war , soon after he won the @entity260 award he was exotic , he was different			1
the media was n’t as sensationalist back then , but we all knew his background , all knew whose side he was on in the war			0
i suppose it is testament to what he was like as a player and a person that he won over the crowds			0
in 1956 he was the first foreign player to win the @entity274 — it was the year he won the @entity276 , playing with a broken neck			0
i just look at where he came from and think : ‘ if we all ended up liking a bloke who had fought for the @entity282 , he must have been good			0

@entity13 's latest book , a man walks on to a pitch , is being *serialised* by @entity217 this week
i 'd like to see @entity45 players train on the pitches in the fifties
@entity57 's style was similar to a modern @entity72
i was devastated when i heard @entity8 had died , he was my idol
@entity225 was a great example of how the game has changed
