by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 23 april 2013 the two @entity2 lawyers who went on holiday to a @entity5 island during the media standards inquiry may face an investigation by the barristers ’ disciplinary body			1
a senior mp yesterday wrote to the @entity11 asking it to examine @entity14 revelations about the affair between celebrities ’ barrister @entity17 and @entity18 , a member of @entity2 ’s legal team			1
the couple admit going to @entity22 – apparently only to ‘ discuss the possibility of a future relationship ’ – but claim their affair did not begin until after the @entity2 report was published in november			1
affair : mr @entity17 , a barrister who represented @entity30 , and mrs @entity31 , a member of @entity2 ’s legal team , claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry but @entity35 , a @entity36 mp and aide to health secretary @entity38 , wants the board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the @entity11 ’s code of conduct			1
mr @entity35 , who has already asked @entity2 to investigate the barristers ’ affair , said : ‘ it is only right that an inquiry into breaches of ethical standards be seen to be completely above board itself			1
‘ if there have been breaches of the legal profession ’s ethical code of conduct by members of the @entity59 team , these must be accounted for to the public			0
‘ if this affair is n’t investigated promptly and properly , it risks becoming a stain on the reputation of the @entity59			0
’ twice - married mr @entity17 , 44 , and 40 - year - old mrs @entity31 did not tell @entity2 about their affair and he only learnt of their trip to @entity22 in recent days			1
not informed : @entity2 was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple 's holidaying together in the past week a spokesman for the judge said yesterday : ‘ @entity2 understands that the @entity11 is aware of the recent @entity74 reports			1
it is a matter for the board to decide what , if any , action to take			0
’ @entity10 letter : @entity35 wants @entity11 to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct @entity85 guidelines warn barristers it is very unwise to have relationships with counsel involved in the same case because clients might perceive ‘ a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’			1
that would be likely to breach the lawyers ’ code of conduct			0
it prohibits barristers from acting ‘ where by reason of any connection with the client , the court , or otherwise ’ , a barrister ’s professional independence ‘ might be compromised or there might be prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to the administration of justice ’			0
in his letter , mr @entity35 asks the board to investigate whether there have been several breaches of the code			2
these include engaging in conduct likely to diminish public confidence in the legal profession or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute , a requirement to act with independence and not to do anything that may lead to any inference that a barrister ’s independence may be compromised			0
the @entity11 will normally carry out an initial assessment before deciding whether to undertake a formal investigation which could lead to a disciplinary tribunal			2
the board can impose punishments ranging from words of advice , fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off			0
calls for an investigation came after it emerged that mr @entity17 and mother - of - two mrs @entity31 went to @entity22 last august , days after the public hearings concluded and months before the inquiry ended			2
father - of - three mr @entity17 represented @entity30 and other phone - hacking victims at the @entity59			2
glamorous brunette mrs @entity31 , nicknamed the ‘ thinking man ’s @entity151 ’ , was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the £ 6million inquiry on behalf of the public .			0
