by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 : 18:06 est , 28 november 2013 sweeping attack : @entity4 , pictured , made his case against the @entity6 in a speech in @entity8 one of the country ’s leading judges yesterday compared the behaviour of the @entity6 to the methods of communist @entity13			1
the human rights judges in @entity16 say they are democratic but in reality they dictate the law , just like the communist bosses did , said @entity20 judge @entity4			1
in a sweeping attack on the way the court has been run , he said it was contributing to a ‘ mundane and insidious ’ decline of parliamentary powers and accused it of an orwellian attempt to corrupt democracy			1
@entity4 said the @entity16 court had gone far beyond the rules written for it in the @entity33 and had instead become ‘ the international flag - bearer for judge - made fundamental law ’			1
in a speech delivered in @entity8 and published in @entity37 yesterday he said the court had ‘ a significant democratic deficit ’			1
he condemned the @entity16 judges for demanding that @entity41 must give the vote to convicted prisoners , saying they had ‘ disregarded ’ @entity44 and instead ruled that prisoner voting ‘ was not a matter for democratic determination at all ’			2
‘ to give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old @entity13 was democratic , ’ said @entity4			2
@entity16 uses the word democracy merely as a term of approval for its decisions , he said , and quoted @entity58 , who wrote that ‘ if thought corrupts language , language can also corrupt thought ’			0
his attack on @entity16 was the second in two days by a senior judge			0
on wednesday appeal judge @entity66 called on @entity41 courts to ignore instructions from the @entity70 court , saying that obeying @entity16 had been ‘ an important wrong turning in our law ’			2
@entity4 ’s speech was the first by a senior @entity41 legal figure to accuse the @entity70 court outright of undermining parliamentary democracy			1
he said it had transformed the convention on human rights from the ‘ safeguard against despotism ’ that was intended into a ‘ template for many aspects of domestic legal order ’			0
condemned : @entity4 's speech was an unprecedented attack by a senior @entity41 legal figure he said @entity88 of the @entity33 , which guarantees the right to private and family life , was devised as a protection against the surveillance state of totalitarian governments			1
‘ in the hands of the @entity16 court it has been extended to cover the legal status of illegitimate children , immigration and deportation , extradition , aspects of criminal sentencing , abortion , homosexuality , assisted suicide , child abduction , the law of landlord and tenant , and a great deal else besides , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ none of these extensions are warranted by the express language of the convention			0
’ @entity4 dismissed the idea that because @entity44 passed the @entity117 in 1998 , this means it approves of @entity16 decisions			0
new laws made in @entity16 were ‘ in practice incapable of being reversed by legislation , short of withdrawing from the convention altogether ’ , he said			0
he said democracies ‘ are rarely destroyed by a sudden external shock or unpopular decisions ’			0
the process was usually more ‘ mundane and insidious ’ as they were ‘ slowly drained of what makes them democratic by a gradual process of internal decay and mounting indifference ’ .			0

@entity4 , a judge in the @entity20 , attacked @entity135 judges
he said the they contribute to a ' mundane and insidious ' decline
the speech , in @entity8 , was the first time a senior @entity41 legal figure has attacked the @entity6 so *directly*
