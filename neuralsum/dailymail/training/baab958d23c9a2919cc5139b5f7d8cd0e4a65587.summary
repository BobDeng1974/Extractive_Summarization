@entity31 is currently the subject of a public inquiry , following fears over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies in 2008			0
but even after the pair had been sent home from the hospital , miss @entity7 was still convinced there was something wrong with @entity8			1
she returned again and he was diagnosed with an infection and a lack of iron in his blood , but was then discharged with antibiotics and iron supplements			1

non-hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body			1
the lymphatic system is part of the immune system			0
@entity73 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
in non-hodgkin lymphoma , the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes ( glands )			1
the affected lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			2
the most common symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			1
source : @entity96 ' i 'd taken him to the hospital for that before , but they 'd never come back with anything			2
' then around march time it seemed he was always tired , he 'd scream all night long , and he would n't sleep			2
' he 'd be running around playing and then he 'd suddenly be crying and there was nothing you could do to calm him down or make him feel better			0
' he just went from being really happy and hyper to being really quiet and miserable			0
' he was sleeping all the time and he just lay there really sad			0
he would n't do anything			0
' the last time he was sent away from hospital , @entity8 spent the night severely unwell and collapsed the following morning			1
miss @entity7 felt she had no option but to take him from their @entity15 home to a dedicated unit at the @entity16 , more than 100 miles away			1
within 48 hours of arriving in @entity23 , @entity8 was given morphine and a blood transfusion , having been diagnosed with non-hodgkin lymphoma			1
an mri scan at the beginning of june revealed tumours all over his spine and in his spleen , liver and kidneys			0
non-hodgkin lymphoma is a rare cancer that develops in the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			1
it occurs when white blood cells called lymphocytes - that help the body fight infection and disease - begin growing in an uncontrolled way			2
@entity8 underwent five gruelling round of chemotherapy , and has one more to go			1
miss @entity7 is now keeping people up to date on her son 's progress via @entity145 page @entity8 was also diagnosed with a specific type of non-hodgkin lymphoma known as @entity148 , which affects specific white blood cells known as ' b - cells ' , which mature in the bone marrow			1
miss @entity7 described the shock at finding out her son had advanced cancer			1
she said : ' he was riddled with tumours			0
' even having suspected he might have cancer , the sheer amount of them i could n't have been prepared for			0
' @entity8 's treatment at @entity16 saw him endure five gruelling runs of chemotherapy			1
sessions usually lasted four to five days , followed by him being put on a drip to flush the toxicity of the drugs out of his system			0
' because his cancer was fast growing and very aggressive they had to treat it the same way , ' miss @entity7 said			1
' the third lot nearly killed him			0
he ended up in intensive care and we nearly lost him			0
he picked up a nasty virus and went into septic shock			0
bone marrow biopsies have now revealed @entity8 's cancer cells are gone			2
having had one session of chemotherapy since tests showed the cancer is gone , he has only one left to go			2
miss @entity7 said : ' he 's been absolutely amazing			1
' they 've done awful things to him - weekly lumbar punctures , bone marrow biopsies , chemo			0
' he has bloods taken every single day - and he just deals with it			0
tests show thankfully @entity8 is now cancer free and his mother hopes they may be able to return to their home in @entity33 soon			1
he is pictured here at four years old before his treatment ' when he 's in pain he lies there quietly and deals with it , when he 's well he 's like he is today			0
i have n't seen @entity8 as well since last year			2
' after moving to @entity23 to be close to @entity8 , miss @entity7 is hopeful they may both be able to go back to @entity33 soon			1
she is determined lessons be learned from @entity8 's experience at @entity31			2
she also worries that his disabilities may have been responsible for treatment she describes as ' disgusting '			0
on one occasion , she says , her son 's evident agony almost brought her to tears , yet she was asked by a doctor whether his behaviour was due to his autism			0

miss @entity7 says : ' i know my little boy inside out , i know him better than anyone else does			1
' i understand his body language , every little look on his face , his behaviour			0
' @entity8 does n't talk , he does n't do sign language , he ca n't communicate - but i read him			2
that 's how it 's always had to be			0
so the fact that they would n't listen to me or take me seriously is disgusting			0
' she added : ' if i had n't brought him down here , he would have died from infection			0
' yes , i understand childhood cancer is rare , but it 's not that rare			0
the symptoms were there , i suspected it , so why did n't they ? ' @entity240 , medical director for the @entity241 , said : ' we are very sorry that the paediatric service at @entity31 did not meet the standards of care expected by @entity8 and his family , and we are investigating thoroughly			2

i 'm so proud of him , i really am			0
but at the same time i want people to know that this happens			0
' everyone knows about the breast cancers and the prostate cancers and the things that affect adults , but what do we really know about the cancers children get ? we need to raise awareness			0
' health officials at @entity31 have apologised for @entity8 's care and said they are ' investigating thoroughly '			2
