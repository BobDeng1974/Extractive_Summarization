when the sun is shining , it ’s tempting to take an impromptu day trip or mini-break to the seaside			0
but pet owners who want a day or two off from their beloved cat or dog need to ensure their pet will still get regular meals			2
now one entrepreneur has come up with an automatic pet food dispenser to solve this problem and provide food while owners are away			2
here , a black labrador waits for his meal to be dispensed by the @entity20 connected @entity22 feeder the stainless steel cylinder measures 32inches ( 81cm ) tall and 11inches ( 28cm ) in diameter			0
it connects to a @entity20 so owners can feed their pets remotely			2
owners communicate with the feeder using an @entity30 or @entity31 app. the feeder dispenses a measured meal five times in 24 hours and can be used manually by pushing the lid if owners are at home			2
users can take a photo and video of their pet using the app. the feeder also has a motion sensor and can take a 30 second video when movement is detected			0
when food is low , an email is sent to owners to remind them to top the feeder up			0
the feeder claims to be waterproof and raccoon and squirrel - proof			0
the stainless steel cylinder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day , or a user can remotely control it using an app on their smartphone or tablet			1
unlike other automatic feeders , the @entity22 can take photos and videos of dogs and cats and allows absent owners to talk to their pet via a built - in microphone and speaker			1
the device was invented by @entity68 in @entity69 , who came up with the idea after he struggled to find someone to feed his two cats when he went on holiday			1
@entity68 , who works as an electrical engineer , said : ‘ i wanted to be able to interact with the cats while i was on vacation			1
’ ‘ i have been in the electronics business for 30 years , so once i committed to making a feeder , i wanted to make the best feeder on the market			0
the stainless steel cylinder can be programmed to provide meals at certain times of the day or a user can remotely control it using an app on their smartphone or tablet			1
the app ( pictured ) also lets people watch a live stream of their hungry pets ‘ the cats needed to be fed outside , and the feeder had to prevent the raccoons from taking all the food			1
‘ the @entity22 feeder easily connects to your @entity20 , and you connect to your @entity22 via an @entity30 or @entity31 app. ' he explained users of the high tech dispenser can feed animals up to five times a day , or log in using the app to decide when to feed their pets themselves			1
unlike other automatic feeders , the @entity22 ( pictured ) can take photos and videos of dogs and cats and allows absent owners to talk to their pet via a built - in microphone and speaker ‘ you can talk , listen , feed , watch and take photos and videos			1
there is even motion detection which takes 30 second videos of your pet , ' @entity68 continued			2

there is currently no indication as to when the feeder will be available to buy , however			0
it is estimated to cost £ 217 ( $ 365 ) and @entity68 aims to reduce the price to £ 178 ( $ 299 ) once @entity22 is mass produced			1
