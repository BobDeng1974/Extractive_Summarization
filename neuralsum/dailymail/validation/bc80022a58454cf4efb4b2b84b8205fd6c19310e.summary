a leading paediatrician has said he would rather his children used marijuana than alcohol , such is the devastation that drink can cause			1
@entity5 , professor of paediatrics at @entity7 , said while he would prefer youngsters to use neither , if forced to make a choice , he would opt for pot. writing for the @entity12 , he said that as his children grow up , he is frequently asked - given his profession - which of the two substances he would prefer them to use			1
he said : ' the immediate answer , of course , is “ neither "			0
and after sifting through all the studies and all the data , i still say “ neither "			0
usually , i say it more than once			0
' but if i ’m forced to make a choice , the answer is “ marijuana "			0
' @entity5 , professor of pediatrics at @entity7 , said while he would prefer youngsters used neither alcohol or marijuana , if forced to make a choice , he would opt for pot his decision is based on research into a number of factors - essentially the harm caused by both drugs			1
but in the course of his debate , he explains that while marijuana is easy to demonise because it 's illegal , the evidence shows that in terms of harm and death , alcohol causes significantly more damage			1
he goes on to argue that while research has linked marijuana to changes in the brain and psychosis , as well as changes in lung function and cancer risk , ' these are all associations , not known causal pathways '			2
instead , he explains , there may be other factors that explain these links - perhaps people with mental health problems are more likely to use the drug , he suggests			2
however he warns what many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol			1
he cites statistics from the @entity66 , which state that alcohol use is a factor in 40 per cent of all violent crimes in the @entity71 , including 37 per cent of rapes and 27 per cent of aggravated assaults			0
what many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol , he warns no such association has been found among marijuana users			1
' people who are high are not committing violence , ' he explains			0
he goes on to add that nearly 20 per cent of male delinquents and 10 per cent of female delinquents have an alcohol problem			0
meanwhile binge drinking was responsible for around half of the 80,000 alcohol - related deaths in the @entity71 in 2010 , whereas cannabis kills virtually no one			2
he also factors in statistics for drink driving and domestic violence - and once again , alcohol fares worse			2
as it does in terms of long - term dependency			0
professor @entity5 states that while nine per cent of pot users eventually become dependent , more than 20 per cent of alcohol users do			1
from first - hand experience as a paediatrician , he says he has also seen more damage - some almost fatal - caused by alcohol poisoning			2
then there is the link with unprotected sex , drunken fights and accidents - all of which are significantly more likely when alcohol is thrown into the mix. despite being marginally in favour of marijuana over alcohol , professor @entity5 denies his arguments are ' pro pot ' - nor is he burying the negative effects of the drug			1
indeed , he goes on to acknowledge marijuana does have risks and negative consequences - and they are ' certainly greater than zero ' .			0

@entity5 is professor of paediatrics at @entity7
says he is often asked if he would prefer his children to use alcohol or pot
while the answer is obviously neither , he says if pushed , he *'d* opt for pot
research shows it has a better *safety* profile than alcohol , he says
warns that many people - especially parents - *underestimate* risk of booze
