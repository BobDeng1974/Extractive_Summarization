by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 10:09 est , 4 july 2012 a previously unknown work by the @entity3 master @entity4 today sold for nearly £ 2million after spending a century with owners who did n’t know what it was			1
art experts were stunned when the family who owned it phoned them about the lost drawing of the market place in @entity14			1
the vendors had no idea of the value of the 10x14 inch work until they made enquiries about selling it with @entity22 auctioneers @entity21			2
famed @entity14 painter @entity4 created the work in the mid- 18th century and it shows the market square , paved in 1758 , ten years before his death			1
a previously unknown work by the @entity3 master @entity4 of the market place in @entity14 has sold for nearly £ 2m today			1
the drawing shows the church of @entity29 with the @entity30 leading right up to the @entity32 bridge @entity4 often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today ( above ) the drawing was acquired in 1876 by the @entity39 landscape and genre painter @entity40			1
it has remained in private hands ever since , being passed down his family until his unnamed descendants sold it at the auction house			2
enthusiasts and experts had no knowledge of it and it was never referred to in books despite it staying with the same @entity39 family			1
the emergence of the work - the first drawing by @entity4 to come on the market in around 30 years - delighted both scholars and the art world			1
born @entity4 and nicknamed @entity4 , which means ' little canal ' , he lived most of his life at @entity63 , in a modest apartment in the @entity66 district of @entity14			1
following his father @entity69 into painting theatrical scenery , his fame and money came later when he moved on to depict daily urban @entity14 life			0
Оne оf hіs finest early pieces іs @entity74 whіch depicts а humble working area оf the city			0
@entity4 later became known fоr hіs grand scenes оf canals аnd the @entity79			1
he spent several years painting in @entity81 , which brought him even closer to his rich clients			2
he died in 1768 in the apartment where he had lived for most of his life			0
it sold for a hammer price of £ 1.7million but with fees added on , the overall price paid was £ 1.94million			0
@entity88 , head of old master drawings at @entity21 , said : ' this work is completely unknown			2
the owners are the descendants of the man who bought it in 1876			1
they phoned up and i was going to @entity95 and arranged to meet them			0
' although they had been told it was by @entity4 , they had no idea quite how wonderful it was or what it might be worth			1
' i said that it was not just a @entity4 drawing ; it was fantastic , amazing			1
i gave them the estimate and they were pleasantly surprised			0
' their ancestor ’s collection was split up over the years between the family members			2
' the current owners are not particularly wealthy , but importantly they looked after it			2
' many @entity4 drawings are hung in too much light and they lose the sparking light , which is the important thing			1
only a minority of his drawings are in a great condition like this			0
' mr @entity88 said the price paid for the @entity4 is a record for a drawing by the artist , easily dwarfing the previous sum of £ 493,103 paid in 1986			1
@entity4 - better known as @entity4 - was a @entity14 painter of landscapes and an important printmaker in etching			1
he often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today			0
it was drawn in pen and brown ink over numerous ruled chalk lines with grey wash to make the tones			0
it shows the church of @entity29 with the @entity30 leading right up to the @entity142			0
and it is made far more interesting by the numerous people going about their business in the market square			0
he drew the scene many times through his career and it is one of the city ’s most picturesque places and is the centre of @entity14 ’s banking industry			0
mr @entity88 said : ' @entity4 painted the scene several times during his life and this was drawn in the late 1750s or early 1760s			1
' he has tinkered with it a bit and played a little bit fast and loose and you ca n’t stand in one place and see everything in this scene			0
but that ’s his genius			0
' there was huge interest when the drawing went under the hammer			0
mr @entity88 said : ' its appearance at auction today generated huge excitement , culminating in an intense bidding battle between six determined collectors			0
' together they drove the price to a sum more than five times the original estimate and four times the previous record for a drawing by the artist			0
the record price paid at auction for a @entity4 is £ 18.6million for view of @entity188 to @entity189 in 2005			2
