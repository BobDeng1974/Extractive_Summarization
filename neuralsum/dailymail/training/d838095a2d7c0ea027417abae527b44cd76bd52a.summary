by @entity0 it tells the story of vicar @entity3 as he struggles to support his inner - city church with dwindling funds and ever fewer worshippers			1
but the sitcom rev makes painful viewing for one fan – because it mirrors the reality he faces every day			0
the @entity10 is the vicar of @entity11 ’s in @entity12 , @entity13 , which provides the backdrop for the successful cult show and is also its inspiration			1
desperate times : @entity10 ( right ) said his fate is uncannily similar to that of @entity21 's character in @entity3 just like his fictional equivalent , he is fighting to avert the threat of his parish going bankrupt and the closure of his church			1
mr @entity10 receives a £ 20,000 location fee from the @entity28 and a £ 30,000 subsidy from the @entity30 but this is not enough to save the @entity32 - listed 18th century building which is now on the @entity33			1

mr @entity10 , the vicar of @entity11 ’s since 1983 , said the show is so accurate it is sometimes hard to watch			2
his parish , which has a congregation of 150 , needs £ 90,000 a year from outside the @entity30 to stay afloat but receives nowhere near enough			2
struggle : @entity11 's in @entity12 , @entity13 , is just one of thousands of churches struggling to stay open the changing landscape of the @entity13 has seen families who would have made up the bulk of its congregation move away to be replaced by younger , secular residents			1
there are also now 13 mosques in the borough			0
‘ we will do a lot of prayer and hope to pull a miraculous rabbit out of an as yet non-existent hat ’ , said mr @entity10 , 65			0
‘ last year we spent £ 250,000 working on the roof and the year before £ 180,000 on the roof and £ 92,000 on railings and gates			1
@entity3 shows the truth about people who love their church and understand it but do not have the resources to run it			1
’ now in its third series – the final episode is on monday night – the sitcom is written by @entity78 and @entity21 , who also appeared in @entity79			0
