a paste that mimics and even helps to rebuild worn tooth enamel could soon bring relief to sufferers of sensitive teeth			1
researchers in @entity6 have developed a material that can form a barrier over areas of teeth that are responsible for causing pain when eating hot or cold foods			1
the study found that when tested on dogs , the paste provided relief for at least 70 days			2
it is caused by areas of the soft dentine that lies beneath the hard enamel of teeth becomes exposed			1
this dentine contains hundreds of thousands of microscopic tube - like structures that radiate out from the pulp and contain a fluid			2
tooth sensitivity tends to occur as a result of the gradual exposure of the softer inner parts of the tooth that lie beneath the enamel , known as ' dentine '			1
@entity48 is composed of tiny tubules that lead to the nerves that extend though the tooth pulp			0
these tubes are filled with fluid that can be disturbed by sudden changes in temperature that occur when eating or drinking cold and hot foods			0
extremely sweet or hard foods can also cause changes in the fluid			0
the movement of the fluid triggers the mechanoreceptors on the nerves in the tooth , triggering a short , sharp pain			0
@entity48 can also be exposed as gums recede or if tooth enamel is chipped			1
changes in the flow of the fluid in the dentine tubes due to physical pressure or hot or cold drinks triggers nerves located on the pulp side of the tubes			0
now professor @entity74 , a researcher at the school of dentistry at the @entity78 , and his colleagues claim to have an answer			1
they have developed a material using calcium carbonate and silica that can seal the exposed dentine tubes and catalyse the regeneration of enamel			1
they have now tested their new paste on dogs and found that it plugged exposed tubes more deeply than other treatments , such as special toothpastes			1
tests on the dogs ' teeth revealed ' significant crystal growth ' and ' no pulp irritation after 70 days , ' wrote researchers			1
professor @entity74 said : ' the biomimetic crystal layer can serve as a more reliable barrier that protects the pulp tissue			0
' in fact , this crystal layer may act as a promoter for the mineralization of the pulp - dentin complex by inducing the permeation of calcium ions			0
' we believe that the novel mesoporous biomaterials presented here have great potential for serving as both a catalyst and as a carrier in the repair or regeneration of dental hard tissue			0
' overall , the animal study revealed that the paste exhibited a more favorable dentin pulp response than did the other treatments			0
' cold foods like ice cream can trigger sensitive teeth the natural ' glue ' used by mussels to stick to rocks has offered another potential cure for sensitive teeth			1
@entity133 - @entity132 , of @entity135 's @entity134 , and @entity136 , of the @entity137 , drew inspiration from the sticky secretions produced by mussels			0
his team created a compound that could help keep minerals in contact with dentine long enough for the teeth to rebuild			2
they created a sticky polydopamine material mixed with the minerals calcium and phosphate			0
in tests in the lab , reported in journal @entity157 , teeth bathed in the sticky material and minerals reformed dentine and enamel			1
in contrast , teeth bathed just in minerals reformed only enamel			0
they authors say that the substance ' may be a simple universal technique to induce enamel and dentine remineralisation simultaneously '			0
sensitive teeth is caused by the soft dentine beneath the enamel becoming exposed , meaning that hot and cold foods can trigger nerves inside the tooth to cause shooting pains that affect around one in five adults the graphic above shows how the molecules of calcium carbonate silicate ( labelled @entity183 ) paste combines with phosphoric acid to produce calcium ( labed @entity186 + ) crystals that eventually seal the exposed dentine tubes tests in dogs showed that the new paste treatment could be used to repair cavities in their tooth enamel an estimated 40 million adults in the @entity195 suffer from sensitive teeth at some point			1
it normally occurs as the enamel on teeth is worn down by over brushing and decay , or if enamel becomes chipped			2
while some toothpastes have been developed to help reduce the pain from sensitive teeth , they are only temporary and require continual use to prevent it from returning			1
however , writing in the journal @entity209 , professor @entity74 believes his paste may provide a more permanent solution			2
it uses gelatin to deliver a calcum carbonate silicate to the problem tooth			0
this is mixed with phosphoric acid , which causes crystals to grow on the dentine and seals up any exposed tubes			2
these crystals penetrate deeper into the dentine tubes and so provide a far longer lasting seal , he said			0
the researchers hope the treatment could also be used to repair minor damage to teeth caused by tooth decay and to reduce the pain caused by tooth chips			1
professor @entity74 added : ' the material i have developed is for use in a dental clinic as a treating material not for tooth paste			2

researchers from the @entity78 developed the new paste
tests in dogs show it seals off exposed dentine that causes sensitive teeth
one in five adults suffer from sensitive teeth at some point in their lives
it is caused by the enamel that protects tooth dentine being worn away
*scientists* say it could provide a long - term solution to sensitive teeth
the new paste may even help repair worn enamel , the researchers claim
