' the first day of school i held his hand walking into the class room , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's more like a brother to me – his mum left the family home at a reasonably young age and his dad had five kids and he needed people to look after various kids at different times			2
' @entity106 seemed to come to our place and stay for three or four months at a time			2
' since then they 've been best men at each other 's weddings and godfathers for each other 's children			2
@entity26 , pictured in april ( left ) and august ( right ) while training for the @entity6 @entity10 , his best friend of 40 years , challenged him to change his lifestyle and film it for a tv show @entity10 ( left circle ) and @entity26 ( right circle ) played together in the @entity121 's the duo came up with the idea to change @entity26 's lifestyle , and turn it into a tv show in the process , after a long day of drinking beer and watching cricket on @entity130 last year			1
' the next morning @entity106 said " we had a brilliant time but it looks like you 've been doing those days more often than you should " , ' @entity0 told @entity135			2
' @entity137 did i know he 'd had a chat with my wife and she had said to him perhaps if you get the right moment you should bring that up			0
' it was a difficult discussion for the friends of 40 years but @entity0 knew that @entity10 was right			1
the 45 - year - old had tried various fad diets and weight loss pills over the years , but nothing had stuck			1
@entity0 , who is a breakfast radio host on @entity4 , lost 30kg in six months ' we thought we might be able to show people you can lose weight through fun and a challenge rather than just a personal trainer yelling at you , ' he said			1
' and i 'm probably more likely to keep weight off if we do it our way than just have fun			0
' they signed a contract with @entity161 , who the pair had previous worked with on the @entity165 series			2
three separate seasons followed @entity0 as he immersed himself with cricket fans in @entity168 , @entity169 and the @entity170 – all after a challenge from @entity10			1

but @entity0 , who lives with his family on @entity91 's @entity176 , says it has been a lot of effort to get this point			1
the first thing he tackled was his smoking addiction , having his last cigarette on december 31 last year			0
the second thing he had to change was his diet			0
before he started training for the marathon , his daily food intake was massive			0
' for breakfast i 'd have eggs and bacon with lots of toast , then mid-morning i 'd have either bakery food – like a couple of cakes or sausage rolls - or i 'd grab two cheeseburgers from @entity198 , ' he said			0
' then i 'd have some sort of lunch like a chicken schnitzel roll maybe with some chips			0
' in the afternoon i 'd have a finger bun when i picked up the kids from school			0
' dinner would be a normal dinner of protein with veggies and salad , then later i 'd have a cup of tea and a couple of rows of choccy			0
' but he says that is the ' old @entity0 '			2
now he has cut out sugar and processed food , and started eating more fruit and vegetables			0
he still has bacon and eggs for breakfast , but he 's swapped the toast for avocado or tomato			0
@entity26 training on the @entity229 steps in @entity91 in april , when he first started his weight loss regimen the first episode of @entity0 : @entity174 will air next thursday november 6 on @entity161 mid-morning he has a piece of fruit , followed by a chicken wrap or chicken salad for lunch			1
he has another piece of fruit in the afternoon followed by a dinner of fish or chicken with salad and veggies			0
and he 's stopped having an after dinner snack			0
@entity0 says he 's also cut down on alcohol			1
' basically i 've stopped the grog , i might have a couple of beers a week , ' he said			0
' before that the old @entity0 would have had a good filling of grog - i reckon probably one big lunch a week because of radio industry , a couple of bottles of wine and a case of beer			1
' since filming started in april , @entity26 has also committed to a five - day - a - week exercise regimen with the help of personal trainer and nutritionist @entity259			1

' at the end of eight weeks i started walking for four minutes , running for one , and i 'd do that for an hour			0
he slowly increased the number of minutes he was running until he could run for five minutes without needing a walking break			0
after three months of training he completed a 5km run			0
after four months he ran 10km			0
three months in he ran a half marathon			2
the whole time @entity10 has been talking to @entity26 over phone , email and @entity281 and encouraging him to push harder with his training			1
' we talk every day pretty much – it 's perfect timing as i 'm driving to work because it 's early afternoon @entity173 time , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 , pictured training on the @entity229 steps in april , ran the @entity6 on sunday @entity26 ( pictured in early october ) is confident he will be able to keep up his new , healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling ' he just fills me in on what is going on in his life , and keeps giving advice like " your kids are watching you , if you do this you 'll set such a great example ''			1
' @entity26 is also confident that he will be able to keep up his new , healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling			2
' the underlying thing is i 'm moving and i 'm eating better and if you do that you 'll be feeling better , ' he said			0
' my family and my mates wo n't let me give up , and my body now rejects crappy food , it really does			0
' i 've said that in the past but i think this time i might have cracked it			0
