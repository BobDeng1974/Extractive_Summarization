' for me , @entity1 's best player is @entity3			1
he 's the best defender in @entity4			2
i do n't understand why nobody talks about him			0
it ’s strange because i think he ’s complete			0
he 's very strong , he ’s got a good jump , he 's fast and he 's got good technique			2
' it 's fair to say @entity14 is n't a bad judge			2
the former @entity16 and @entity17 international has won a thing or two but it is never easy to pour such glowing praise on your old enemy			2
as he proved at the @entity24 again on tuesday night though , @entity3 is a player every man on the street would like on his team			1
@entity3 heads home from close range to give @entity1 the lead at @entity24 on tuesday the @entity32 international slides on his knees after scoring another crucial goal for @entity1 he is subsequently mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates as they celebrate their goal in the @entity17 capital @entity3 has scored seven goals in the @entity39 since 2009 , more than any other defender			1
he has netted 30 times in all competitions since joining @entity1 in 2008			1
he is a throwback to the defenders of old , ruthless , uncompromising , takes no prisoners , leaves no - one behind ; he is a leader of men and , for @entity1 , so often their saviour			1
his blood - stained right boot worn in the bruising @entity48 semi-final against @entity50 is primed for @entity1 's academy			1
it is an example to aspiring players of what really matters in sport			2
it 's not money , not flash watches but the commitment , dedication and pain it takes to get to the very top			2
the other white , relatively unblemished @entity65 boot is to be framed and mounted in @entity3 's @entity67 home - but only if @entity1 win the @entity48			1
@entity3 's blood - stained boot in the @entity48 semi-final against @entity50 is destined for the academy at half - time against @entity50 , @entity3 limped back to dressing room , poured the blood out of his boot and asked to be cleaned up			1
a bullet - hole wound caused by a stud on the bridge of his foot was plugged , strapped and @entity3 asked for an injection			1
' it was really painful during the game , a lot of swelling , like any wound , but it ’s all right			0
it ’s just a wound , it ’s open			0
i did n’t have stitches because they did n’t want to close the wound because of the inflammation			0
' that 's ok , then			2
days later when @entity90 surveyed the walking wounded he was selecting to face champions @entity92 his eyes focused on the burly defender he holds in such esteem limping into the dressing room			1
' are you ok @entity99 ? ' he asked			0
' do n't worry about me			0
just look after the others , ' came the reply			0
@entity90 did n't expect anything else			1
@entity3 celebrates his winning goal against @entity104 earlier this month @entity105 cleans his team - mates boot after the @entity32 's goal with 24 minutes remaining at @entity108 @entity92 marked a milestone for @entity3 as a @entity1 player			1
he needed the aid of an injection but there was no way he was missing this , his 300th game			0
not one for too many mementos , @entity3 kept the boots and shirt from that game to frame			1
sadly , opportunist thieves stole them from his car later that night			0
he still did n't make a fuss , even though it has taken a lot of hard work to make it this far			0
the early days were ones of despair when @entity130 barely played him			0
often he battled to impress his new club			0
@entity133 captain @entity132 recalled getting caught in a fight with his compatriot during a typically combative @entity133 - @entity1 encounter			1
' i said : '' what are you doing ? we are @entity32			2
'' @entity3 said : '' even if you were family i would fight you , i want to win ''			2
' @entity141 poses with @entity130 after agreeing a deal to join @entity1 back in january 2008 @entity143 poses with his team - mates ahead of the new season ; he is pictured sporting a rare beard as @entity3 says : ' you need to motivate yourself			1
to go over the limit			0
even if you do n’t think someone is against you , you have to find motivation			0
it is important in winning matches to find extra motivation inside yourself			0
sometimes we need to feel this extra pressure			0
' @entity157 's @entity156 may beg to differ after his throttling at the hands of @entity3 , but that quality makes him a coach 's dream			1
@entity90 wanted @entity3 when he went to @entity163			1
@entity164 and @entity165 enquired and @entity166 would still like to sign him now			1
surprisingly , he has just 18 months left on contract and the fact he has turned 30 is @entity1 's excuse for , so far , postponing discussions over a new deal			1
for @entity3 , it 's not about the money			1
@entity176 said he is the scariest player he has faced , ' a human tank			0
' @entity143 grabs @entity156 round the neck during @entity1 's win at @entity157 earlier this month the defender was described by @entity176 as the scariest player he has faced his good friend , tennis star @entity182 talks of a mutual admiration			1
@entity184 was grateful he did n't tell all about his infamous bite			0
' @entity99 ' shuns club attempts to get him on @entity187 and @entity188			0
he turns down lucrative commercial deals because he simply does n't see a need to take money for a product he does n't like			0
he drives the same @entity193 he bought when he joined @entity1 seven years ago			2
it 's practical for taking his family around town			0
an intensely private man , he enjoys nothing better than a family day with wife and childhood sweetheart @entity201 , son @entity202 and twins @entity204 and @entity205			0
the @entity1 defender poses with his wife @entity201 at @entity182 's gala dinner in @entity209 last year @entity3 pictured in action for former club @entity211 against @entity212 in 2006 he does n't wear a watch , the @entity213 presented for being part of @entity1 's @entity39 winning side gets an occasional dusting			1
parties and fashion are not his forte as his team - mates often jest - but he is still the man they turn to for advice			2
@entity3 is on the @entity1 players ' committee where senior figures help the younger ones with problems and liaise with management			1
it 's a compassionate and understanding side that many a trainee appreciates and he puts it to further use as the patron of ' @entity234 ' a charity that fights the fight against testicular cancer			0
@entity239 's @entity238 has been grateful for his support			0
' a competitive animal , a big heart , ' was how @entity90 described him			2
understated , yes , but that 's just how @entity3 likes to play it .			1

@entity3 scored another key goal for @entity1 in their @entity166 draw
he 's one of the first names on @entity90 's team sheet ; a leader of men
