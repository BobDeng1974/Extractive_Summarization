by @entity0 a group of @entity3 fishermen were astounded when they snagged a monster hammerhead shark last week but were even more shocked when they realized the injured beast was ready to give birth and they were going to have to be the doctors			1
@entity10 and his friends had been wrestling with the massive catch for hours off the 700 - foot @entity14 pier when it became tangled on a pole			2
@entity10 threw caution to the wind and jumped into the murky water only to realize the shark was seriously injured and its pups were actually trying to bite their way out of her and into the world			1
even more shocking : they could see a tail sticking out of the hole			0
' they were trying to push their heads out , so i 'm guessing the mom tried to give birth but she did n't have the strength to push them out , ' said @entity10			0
a shark expert told @entity58 that the hole in the shark 's abdomen likely resulted from a bite from another shark that attacked her as she fought against the fisherman 's line			1
one by one , the fishermen pulled the wriggling babies out of their mother bittersweet : all told the fishermen pulled twenty pups from their mother and watched them swim free into the @entity73 the group of fishermen pulled the pups out one at a time until they 'd delivered twenty of the wriggling baby sharks that one of the men called ' very alert			2
' ' i stood in the water for a couple of seconds to make sure they swam off good			0
i held them and as soon as i put them out , voom ! they took off , ' remembers @entity10			0
the mother hammerhead , an endangered species died			2
attacked : one expert noted that the shark was likely bitten , not by her own pups , but by another shark as she fought against the line			1
she did not survive the injuries			0

the @entity14 , @entity3 fishermen saw the pups trying to *escape* from a bite that was taken out of their mother
an expert said the bite was likely *incurred* from another shark while the mother fought against the fishermen
