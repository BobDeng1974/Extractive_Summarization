by @entity0 armed with a small gps device and some hacking tools , the spy sneaks from house to house , tapping into vulnerable @entity7 systems and exposing networks that can be accessed with ease			1
but this is n’t a human testing out the security capabilities of homes ; rather , it ’s a cat fitted with a gadget around its neck to see if pets could hack into @entity7 networks			1
it might sound far - fetched , but it ’s a scenario that was played out recently by one security expert , and while its slightly tongue - in - cheek he says that cats could indeed be used as mobile hackers , highlighting unsecure networks in a neighbourhood			0
@entity27 in @entity28 used a siamese cat ( stock image shown ) called @entity31 to hack into his neighbours ' networks			1
the pet was fitted with a device around its collar to seek out vulnerable @entity7			1
the device included a gps device and hacking tools and cost less than £ 60 ( $ 100 ) @entity40 has unveiled an elite squad of hackers tasked with scouring the internet for security holes and defending the public against cyberattacks			1
unveiled as ' @entity48 ' the team will hunt for bugs in the world 's most popular software , such as @entity52 and @entity53			0
' you should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state - sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer , steal secrets or monitor your communications , ' @entity40 security researcher @entity54 said in a blog post			0
yet he said sophisticated attacks continue to target , for instance , human rights activists and businesses			0
' this needs to stop			0
we think more can be done to tackle this problem			0
' we 're hiring the best practically - minded security researchers and contributing 100 per cent of their time toward improving security across the internet			0
' at the @entity77 conference this weekend in @entity78 , @entity75 security engineer @entity27 will present a rather unusual bit of research			1
titled ‘ weaponising your pets : the @entity88 and the @entity89 , ’ @entity82 ’s presentation will explain how he used a cat and tracking collar to hack into @entity7 networks			2
' the collar contained a gps device and a cellular component and would track your cats movements throughout the neighbourhood , ’ @entity27 explains on the @entity77 website			1
he also explains that , if the owner gets nervous that the cat might get caught , the gps device can be used to find the cat and retrieve it			2
according to @entity99 the method used was something called ‘ wardriving ’ , which involves scouring multiple networks to see how secure they are			0
usually one might expect a hacker to drive round in a car and search for networks and see which were vulnerable			0
but @entity82 ’s method instead fitted a cat with a digital collar and used it as a smaller ‘ wardriving ’ agent , something that he has dubbed ‘ @entity113 ’			0
@entity27 will present his findings at the @entity77 hacking conference in @entity78 this weekend			1
he says that he had no malicious intent but it is does highlight that some people should update their home security settings			1
pictured is a team competing in @entity77 17 on 1 august 2009 the device strapped around the cat ’s neck cost less than £ 60 ( $ 100 ) and looked for an older form of wireless encryption that can be easily broken , known as @entity128			1
the modern @entity130 encryption , meanwhile , is more secure			0
using a friend ’s cat called @entity31 , he was able to find 23 @entity7 hotspots and more than a third of them used @entity128 encryption and thus could be hacked into			2
while he insists his research was solely for fun and not with any malicious intent , he explains that anyone could mimic his device with relative ease			2
and the method goes to show that if even a cat can break into someone 's weak home @entity7 , they should perhaps consider upgrading their security to make it less accessible to hackers .			2

the device included a gps device and hacking tools and cost less than £ 60
the cat then explored 23 homes and found that more than a third of them used a vulnerable encryption system called @entity128
@entity27 says that he had no malicious intent but it is does highlight that some people should update their home security settings
he will present his findings at the @entity77 hacking conference this weekend
