there is some weight behind the notion that this has been @entity3 ’s best week for almost four years			1
if hitting @entity6 for six was n’t encouraging enough , the resignation of the unpopular director @entity5 ought to have made it so			1
not since the @entity8 win at @entity9 against @entity10 have such broad smiles been seen on the faces of @entity13 in the second city			1
they have been a club whose recent history is entrenched in misery and financial ruin , brought about by @entity21 ’s disastrous ownership from 2009 , and @entity5 has always been seen as the chairman ’s sidekick			2
it was he who assumed the acting role when @entity21 relinquished himself of duties at the club ahead of being sentenced to a six - year jail term for money laundering in march			0
@entity3 director @entity5 ( right , next to @entity21 ) resigned from the club last week @entity29 had a game to remember as he bagged a hat - trick against @entity6 young winger @entity29 celebrates with team - mates after helping @entity3 thrash @entity6 6 - 1 it is under the watch of this pair that the @entity13 have seen a trail of destruction follow them , with a transfer embargo issued in 2012 and accounts filed late			1
the club suffered , a shadow of the one to spend seasons in the @entity43 and a ground , @entity45 ’s , that home fans did n’t want to visit			0
many simply did n’t bother			0
they have been under the control of @entity49 , who has operated as the club ’s managing director , amid the upheaval in september when @entity5 ’s five - year contract was up			1
@entity3 have been sleepwalking into the lower leagues after serial neglect , but there appears to be a chink of light			2
@entity5 ’s departure - barely recognised by the club , who issued a statement made up of two paragraphs on friday - comes in the aftermath of threatening comments he allegedly made to a fans ’ website and author of a book about the club , also suggesting financial ruin was n’t far away			2
supporters remain worried that he could come back with a vengeance			0
@entity73 has instilled a brighter environment since taking over from the maligned @entity75 @entity5 is up for re-election of the club ’s parent company , @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , on december 23 and , if successful , could still have a huge role to play when the club eventually changes hands			1
the @entity88 have set up a petition in a bid to voice concern to @entity77 shareholders , claiming : ‘ from a lack of communication with supporters to the excessive remuneration package he received while acting chairman of the club , @entity5 showed not only a lack of basic leadership , but also a lack of respect for the club ’s true custodians – the fans			2
@entity21 - who bought the club in 2009 - was jailed for six years after being found guilty of money laundering @entity5 ( third from right ) alongside @entity21 in 2009 in happier times for supporters of the @entity13 ‘ we believe that the re-election of @entity5 will see the return of these issues			1
thus , as supporters , we must act to ensure that this does not happen – for the best interests of @entity109			0
’ and they ’ve far more chance of uniting against the systematic decline of their club while results improve dramatically			0
that boils down to one man : @entity73			0
appointed manager after @entity75 left in october , the former full back has overseen four wins from his seven games in charge , losing just once			0
that includes the drubbing dished out to hapless @entity6 at the weekend , thanks to a hat - trick from 18 - year - old local boy @entity29 - only the second time they have scored more than four goals in a league fixture since january 2006			1
for the record , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 all scored in a 5 - 0 win against @entity138 that day			0
@entity140 scored the opening goal for @entity3 on saturday as they thumped the hapless @entity6 but now @entity73 , widely regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in management after impressing at @entity146 , has @entity3 playing with panache again , and the enjoyment is back			1
so too are the fans			0
@entity45 ’s is a place people actually want to visit nowadays and the @entity13 have a boss who is passionate about his job ; not embarrassingly storming down the touchline after escaping relegation to @entity156 on the final day kind of passion , the sort which has people hanging on his every word			2
that coupled with the potentially for fans to get their way and @entity5 is n’t re-elected later this month , the situation really looks as if it is for turning			0
good week for ... @entity167 the @entity168 warmed up for their @entity170 replay against @entity171 by thumping @entity156 play - off chasers @entity173 4 - 0 at @entity174			1
it was a family affair as @entity167 boss @entity176 got the better of his son @entity177 's upwardly mobile side			1
the @entity179 had only scored 14 goals in the entire season beforehand and are now a couple of points off safety			0
@entity185 's @entity184 cant prevent @entity187 's @entity186 from scoring the winner bad week for ... @entity185 another defeat , this time at the hands of @entity190 ’s @entity187 at home , means @entity185 have lost seven of their last 10 in all competitions			1
new manager @entity195 has quite the job on his hands , marooned in the bottom four			2
talent scout : @entity199 ( @entity200 ) two goals and an assist is n’t a bad return for the 24 - year - old as @entity200 beat @entity205 , but watch out for @entity212 ’s first - the striker smashed home a half - volley direct from a corner on the edge of the box .			0

@entity3 beat @entity6 6 - 1 at the weekend to move clear of trouble
unpopular director @entity5 resigned from the board last week
@entity73 has guided the @entity13 to four wins in the last seven games
@entity176 saw @entity167 pick up a much needed win against @entity173
@entity195 has a tough job at @entity185 after they lost again
