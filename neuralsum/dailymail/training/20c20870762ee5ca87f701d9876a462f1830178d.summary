by @entity0 created 11:28 am on 20th september 2011 in court : @entity2 and his wife @entity3 arrive at @entity4 television presenter @entity2 is suing his former friend and business associate over a failed property deal which left him £ 500,000 out of pocket			1
the @entity10 star , 62 , claims house builder and designer @entity11 , 50 , owes him more than £ 370,000 over the bungled venture on a £ 2.1million country estate			1
the pair had bought @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 together in 2006 and planned to build 26 homes on the site			2
they both put in £ 300,000 to buy the property with the rest supplied by bank loans			1
in total mr @entity2 spent £ 572,000 buying and renovating the property			1
however , planning permission was never granted and when the mansion was sold two years later , mr @entity2 says he got back just £ 52,000 after costs on the bank loans had been paid , while mr @entity11 received the full £ 300,000 he had invested			1
mr @entity2 is now seeking to recoup £ 370,000 of losses incurred on the project			1
the quiz show host told @entity4 he had been ' betrayed ' by his friend and said he had been promised his original £ 300,000 lump sum back			1
but lawyers for mr @entity11 argued that mr @entity2 had knowingly signed legal documents to the contrary and had ' made up ' his version of events			1
they claim he used the deal as a vanity project to revive his struggling television career			2
mr @entity11 has launched a £ 260,000 counter-claim against mr @entity2 for unpaid building work on another home - @entity47 house , in @entity48			1
the former @entity50 star angrily told the court he had been ' betrayed ' by his friend			2
he said : ' i believed in my friend			2
it never occurred to me for a minute that i could be the subject of a betrayal			2
' @entity11 and i were incredibly close friends and the trust between us was tangible			1
he said i will give you your money back first and i will take the hit			0
' it was nothing but a financial disaster for me			0
' mr @entity2 is seeking a six - figure sum from mr @entity11 over dealings on @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 - pictured the friends met in 2002 and @entity2 went to stay with the property tycoon after divorcing his second wife @entity69 in 2004			1
@entity4 heard that they both put £ 300,000 towards the purchase of £ 2.1million @entity16 with bank loans providing the rest			2
planning permission was to be sought by mr @entity11 to turn the site into houses			1
mr @entity2 said they had a verbal agreement he would get his £ 300,00 back from the project first but claims there was no legal document setting out the arrangement			2
taking the stand , mr @entity2 wearing a dark blue suit , white shirt and purple tie , said : ' mr @entity11 put the project forward and suggested we put in £ 300,000			1
' as the weeks went by i realised the vulnerability of my position , although i had total faith in my close friend			0
@entity93 , 50 , outside @entity4 where he is being sued by @entity2 over a property deal that went wrong ' if he did not get planning consent within two years , i was powerless to recoup my money			0
' but @entity11 said he was in control of the project and promised me i could have my £ 300,000 back first			1
' the divorce settlement with my ex-wife had gone through and i had significant capital available			0
i had just signed a contract with @entity103 for two years for @entity10			0
' but knowing the vagaries of executives i certainly did not want £ 300,000 taken up when i might need it in 2008			2
' the court heard that planning permission was not gained within two years and mr @entity2 - whose name the house was registered in - sold the property			0
but after the bank loans were repaid , the presenter got back just £ 52,000 , while mr @entity11 recouped £ 300,000 he had contributed			1
mr @entity2 is now seeking to recoup £ 370,000 of losses incurred on the project			1
but @entity116 , representing mr @entity11 , claimed the whole deal had been a facade to help launch mr @entity2 back into the public eye			1
he cited financial blows the host had received during his six - year tv exodus following the axing of @entity124 in 1999 , before the start of @entity10 in 2005			0
this included the calling - in of liquidators to company @entity129 - of which he was an 80 per cent shareholder - which left him facing a £ 1.5million debt to a bank			2
the court heard he had embarked on a number of ventures , including a video - conferencing business and even promotion of a @entity140 fire extinguishing company			0
mr @entity2 also confirmed he had sold his former 40 - bedroom family home in @entity142 , @entity18 , for £ 8.6million following his 2004 divorce			2
mr @entity116 said the housing project was an opportunity to gain favourable media attention			0
he said : ' you were back in the public eye and it simply suited you to present to the public your position that you were ' bouncing back '			0
' mr @entity2 responded : ' @entity152 suggests this was a vanity project on my behalf and i totally refute that			0
' but mr @entity116 told the star : ' mr @entity2 , you are not naive			0
you are an experienced man and a distinguished broadcaster - and have been for some time			0
' you must know that if someone makes an original agreement that says ' x ' and is invited to sign a legal document that says ' y ' , it is dangerous to sign that legal documentation			0
' i say you are regrettably making up your statement about mr @entity11 promising you £ 300,000			1
' you appreciated that because of the way the deal had been structured , that mr @entity11 was going to say ' i get my £ 300,000 first '			1
' you did not like that and you decided to create a negotiating position by turning it upside down and simply making up this statement about you getting your £ 300,000 first			2
' @entity173 , representing mr @entity2 , likened the feud to a ' divorce '			0
he said : ' both parties accept they were very good friends			0
it has gone very sour and is almost like a divorce			0
' it is mr @entity2 ' case that he was wisely reluctant to join the venture agreement , but he was persuaded by the enthusiasm of mr @entity11			1
' mr @entity11 's case was that mr @entity2 was extremely keen to join the venture after bad publicity - to re-establish his career			1
' it is not the first time @entity2 has had made headlines as a result of a dispute			0
he was caught in a dispute with @entity194 in 1994 when his mr @entity196 theme park in @entity197 - named after the cuddly pink character in @entity199 show @entity124 - shut down			0
the incident - branded ' @entity196 gate ' - cost the council around £ 2million			2
in 2008 father - of - four @entity203 also caused controversy after he claimed he would stop paying his television licence			1
the twice divorced presenter married third wife , @entity10 make - up artist @entity3 , in @entity209 , @entity210 , in 2009			0
she sat by him during the court hearing , which started on monday			0
