it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			0
@entity4 embrace the @entity5 ( yes , really ) , a @entity6 takes charge of @entity8 and it 's not looking good for the @entity9			1
hot @entity5 a spellbinding tournament that reached in to places we could n’t have imagined , last weekend ’s @entity10 in @entity4 even carried a centre spread photograph of @entity16 ’s @entity15			1
imagine how good the whole thing would have been had @entity8 been playing			0
from @entity19 to @entity20 ... they all knew about @entity16 's triumph in the @entity5 @entity22 much disdain from the establishment for the new @entity27 chief ’s talk of four - day test matches but at least he ’s thinking			1
if the long format of the game is n’t quite dying then it ’s certainly withering			0
the future of @entity33 could be in line for a change now @entity36 is the new @entity27 chief @entity37 it ’s tough to dedicate a life to sport when you know that the world is n’t really watching but @entity6 ’s appointment as @entity8 netball coach follows an 81 - cap international career , five years of domestic coaching and the establishment of an academy			0
the @entity49 , still busy			0
@entity50 has played and worked her way to the very top of her sport and is now in charge of @entity8 @entity55 the @entity57 half - back has all his dental work done without anaesthetic ‘ because it ’s quicker ’ but he may find his late career switch from @entity62 to @entity63 a rather more taxing challenge			2
many – on both sides of the divide – will hope he fails but the chances are that he wo n’t			0
it 's all change for @entity55 as he switches codes from @entity62 to @entity63 not @entity70 his @entity20 team sit ninth in that forgotten small - time squabble that is @entity74 and the @entity4 press have called for @entity70 to destroy his squad and rebuild it			1
‘ @entity78 will be the first piece in the new @entity80 ’ , predicted @entity77			0
the monster will need cake , though			0
this better be good , @entity84 ! @entity70 's @entity20 are way off the pace in @entity74 @entity86 @entity87 have injury problems up front but a certainty is that @entity86 will not play at @entity91			1
@entity86 ’s move to his boyhood club has ruined him and if @entity95 had no intention of devising a @entity97 at @entity98 , why on earth did he buy him ? this goal against @entity100 was one of only three @entity86 has scored for @entity87 this season @entity86 celebrates after scoring during @entity87 's victory at @entity103 in january @entity104 further evidence that moving to a big club does n’t always work , @entity104 needs to improve quickly at @entity107			1
it would , however , help if @entity109 could become the first @entity111 manager of three to decide where exactly he wishes to play him			2
@entity104 ( left ) was on @entity8 duty this week but it 's back to the day job with @entity107 @entity116 the esteemed @entity118 coach wants client @entity119 to become ‘ nasty ’ in order to break his major duck at the @entity122 this week , which is odd given that his most successful current student – @entity124 – has won three @entity125 by being exactly the opposite			1
@entity119 will bid to break his major duck next week but is it really time to turn into mr @entity128 ?			2

@entity86 is likely to miss out when @entity87 play @entity91
@entity119 has been urged to develop a nasty streak at @entity132
@entity104 - can @entity109 find his *perfect* position ?
@entity70 has a huge @entity4 job on his hands at @entity20
but he probably *enjoyed* *coverage* of the @entity5 in the paper
