@entity1 , a football coach offered this definition of a fan : ‘ he ’s a guy who spends the afternoon yelling that the quarterback ’s incompetent and the wide receiver ’s a jerk			2
then he leaves the stadium and he ca n’t remember where he parked his car			2
’ the football managers of @entity12 would never dare voice such contemptuous sentiments			0
but from time to time , when vilification becomes truly vicious , their faces reveal their private thoughts			1
most football fans are decent people who are shabbily treated			1
they pay far too much and receive too little in return			0
their views are unheeded and their comfort is largely disregarded			0
yet a small but significant proportion of the football public deserves neither sympathy nor consideration			0
football grounds have never appealed to delicate sensibilities , for conflict lies at the heart of the game			0
but in recent seasons , attitudes have become increasingly belligerent			0
@entity35 boss @entity34 has come under scrutiny from the club 's fans this season , after recent results @entity35 fans hold up a banner wishing @entity34 to leave the club during their match at @entity45 last month there is an air of abrasive entitlement			1
‘ we pay for our seats ! ’ is the cry			0
‘ and that allows us to say and do anything we choose ’			0
in the real world , of course , such attitudes are properly rejected			0
but football inhabits a moral universe in which insults are the common currency			0
those of us who cover the game rarely mention the prevailing atmosphere , since raw malevolence is the weekly norm			0
but from time to time , some small eruption will not be ignored			2
and when such eruptions start to form a pattern , then the game may be forced to take a critical look at itself			1
today , such a pattern seems to be taking shape			0
and the central figure of each little drama is the football manager			2
last week , @entity76 of @entity77 told a particularly irksome provocateur to ‘ f * * * off and die ’			1
he was foolishly offensive , of course , and the @entity82 charge he now faces was inevitable			1
@entity77 boss @entity76 was charged by the @entity82 after an incident with a @entity85 supporter @entity76 appeared to tell a supporter to ' f * * * off and die ' during their match at home to @entity91 in december the @entity77 boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline yet the wonder is that so many of his colleagues somehow contrive to maintain their self - control in the face of dire provocation			1
after a run of fine results , @entity102 has apparently justified his continuing employment on @entity106 but only a few months have passed since he was virtually a prisoner of the dugout , his brief excursions the signal for all manner of screeching derision			1
after his last , successful season , @entity112 has so far been spared a similar fate but if @entity91 lose at @entity116 this lunchtime , the manager may face unhappy consequences when @entity35 visit @entity119 next weekend			1
@entity120 boss @entity102 ( left ) and @entity91 's @entity112 have been scrutinised this season which brings us to @entity34			1
by the depressing standards of @entity126 v @entity35 matches , last weekend ’s affair was unexceptional			1
as the pantomime villain of the @entity128 , @entity34 was jeered from the start			1
when he had clearly decided to remain in his seat , he was taunted with endless choruses of ‘ @entity34 , he ’s scared to stand up ! ’ but the genuine outrage was reserved for @entity126 station on @entity35 ’s homeward journey			1
after their team ’s defeat , a section of the travelling support was intent on challenging their manager			1
the short video , posted on @entity144 , has become shockingly familiar			0
a bunch of jostling oafs pursue him to the train , shouting : ‘ here he is ! here he is ! @entity34 ! @entity34 ! * * * * off ! ’ the c - word is spat out , the threats are despicable			1
and one of the most brilliant managers that the @entity159 game has known , a man whose talents built a stadium , whose club have qualified for the @entity162 on 17 consecutive occasions and who , just last spring , won the @entity165 , is obliged to stride past his knuckle - dragging tormentors with face white and strained			1
it was deeply humiliating , yet it was the consequence of a climate in which the mob may choose a managerial victim and hound him without logic or mercy			0
the radio phone - in , that parliament of fools , prattled : ‘ he ’s not up to the job ... past his sell - by date ... i ’m sorry but he ’s got to go			2
’ in an earlier age the callers might have been reaching for the black cap			0
so - called ‘ social media ’ was equally predictable in the choice of cliche : ‘ tactically naive ... lost the plot			2
’ @entity34 ’s replacement was loosely discussed			1
@entity34 looks dejected as @entity35 came unstuck away at @entity126 in a 3 - 2 defeat earlier in december @entity34 was targeted by @entity35 fans as he boarded a train at @entity192 after the match the 65 - year - old was tormented by a flurry of strong verbal abuse by some travelling supporters at one stage , the popular solution was @entity200 of @entity201			1
then somebody noticed that @entity200 ’s club were near the foot of the @entity205 , so the trail went conveniently cold			2
the hunt for a plausible candidate goes on			0
now major football managers are lavishly rewarded			0
most of them enjoy the financial security of a long - term contract , which may be a factor in their increasing longevity			2
not a single @entity217 manager has been sacked this season , the first time in 18 years that the @entity162 has reached mid-december without a casualty			1
at last , the clubs are accepting that patience is indeed a virtue			0
sadly , that enlightened attitude is not reflected in the conduct of their crowds			0
yet , week after week , club owners sit in cushioned comfort high in the grandstand ; rugs upon their knees , chums at their elbows			2
@entity233 boss @entity200 ( left ) has often been linked with as @entity34 's replacement and somehow they never hear the threats , the menace , the choreographed ugliness belching out from that same , small , loutish section of their following			1
but the poor manager hears , all too clearly , since much of the malice is directed at him			1
and no matter how he affects to ignore it , the relentless jibes take their toll			0
the more thoughtful members of his profession are aware that a crisis is taking shape			0
not in the manner of three decades past , with hazardous terraces and grounds which were tragedies waiting to happen but in a more insidious fashion			0
hostility is flourishing unchecked , civility is perceived as weakness and something akin to hatred is being sown in fertile soil			0
there is a sense that the national game is drifting towards a dangerous acceptance of the unacceptable			0
the urgent need is for deeper thinking , more incisive analysis and credible long - term solutions			2
distinguished managers , the likes of @entity34 , could make valuable contributions to that debate			1
it is surely time that football sought their advice			2
the perils of poverty at rangers the decline of @entity282 continues at saddening pace			0
beaten by @entity284 on friday and hopelessly adrift in their efforts to win promotion from @entity290 ’s second tier , they have just received the resignation of their manager @entity292			2
unfortunately , they can not afford to pay up @entity292 ’s one - year rolling contract			2
how recently it seems since apparently sane people were arguing that the future of @entity282 lay in the @entity217			1
in these straitened times , poor @entity282 might struggle to pay the fare down from @entity301			2
@entity282 boss @entity292 's ( centre ) resignation was rejected as they could n't afford to pay up his contract in the next television football rights deal , the @entity217 is to introduce up to 10 live matches a season on friday nights			1
games in this coveted slot could be worth as much as £ 10million each			0
we must assume that none of these fixtures will include , say , @entity316 v @entity315 ( return journey 508 miles ) , @entity319 v @entity318 ( 578 miles ) or @entity320 v @entity120 ( 708 miles )			1
otherwise , we might conclude that the game has finally sold itself lock , stock and barrel to the television companies			0
and turned its back on the travelling , ticket - buying supporters who have been its most faithful followers these past 100 years .			1

@entity35 manager @entity34 was heckled by some of the club 's fans after their 3 - 2 defeat away at @entity126 in december
@entity77 boss @entity76 faces a @entity82 charge of *misconduct* after a touchline spat with a @entity85 supporter during their defeat against @entity91
majority of @entity120 fans wanted their boss @entity102 out of the club - after an initial poor start to the season
@entity91 boss @entity112 is under scrutiny now for their poor form
for the first time in 18 years no @entity217 manager has been sacked at this stage of the season
