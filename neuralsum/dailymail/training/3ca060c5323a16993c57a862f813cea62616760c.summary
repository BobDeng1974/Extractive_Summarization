connected homes and cities have been buzz words this year , but while urban areas are becoming increasingly smart , the countryside is being left behind			2
a computer scientist is hoping to change this by launching a project that will take the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to an area of @entity10			1
proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars , sensors on riverbanks , and rainfall monitors			1
computer scientist professor @entity18 was recently awarded funding to investigate how the @entity8 could work in the countryside			1
proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars , ( stock image ) sensors on riverbanks and rainfall monitors the project is being led by computer scientist professor @entity18 from @entity28			1
he was recently awarded £ 171,495 ( $ 267,090 ) from the @entity29 to set up a ‘ smart ’ project in @entity31 , @entity10			1
the aim is to investigate how @entity8 could work in the countryside			1
in particular , professor @entity18 will use the technology to tackle problems from flooding and agricultural pollution , to animal movements and drought			0
@entity28 proposes fitting sensors to the riverbanks to monitor river levels and warn of floods			1
a similar system has already been installed by researchers from @entity47 to the @entity48 in @entity49			0
this system uses sensors on the bank , and throughout neighbouring towns to track rising levels , or weather conditions			1
they use a combination of 900 mhz and 144 mhz radio frequencies for data transmission , which means sensor clusters in the network can be as far apart as 34.2 miles ( 5km )			0
some sensor locations are designated as ‘ government office nodes ' and have an office with a laptop computer where data is collected and stored			2
an algorithm is then used to predict flood risks before alert notifications are displayed			2
and if the storm knocks out the local electricity grid , solar - powered backup systems kick in			0
@entity8 is the idea that everyday objects can be connected to the web , and ‘ enables object - to - object communication over the internet and real time data monitoring			2
’ one idea is to fit sheep with digital collars			1
this could be used to track their movements , for example			2
a recent @entity87 show fitted digital collars with cameras to cats to follow them , see where they went and how they interacted with their neighbourhood - and a sheep version could help farmers monitor livestock			1
alternatively , such digital collars could double up as @entity99 hotspots			1
this could be a solution to typically poor broadband speeds and network coverage in the most rural regions of the @entity105			0
at @entity107 , @entity106 installed @entity99 cows to act as similar hotspots			2
although these ‘ cows ’ were , in fact , just masts in the shape of the farmyard animals , the principle could work for livestock in the countryside			2
earlier this year , sheep in @entity118 were fitted with cameras to give a unique view of the @entity121 as it travelled through the county			0

working with partners at the @entity183 , the @entity184 and @entity185 , the project in @entity31 will run for the next 18 months			1
‘ applying this booming technology to the countryside presents challenges - for example how to build a network when there are mountains and trees in the way ? ’ , explained the university			0
but researchers believe the benefits could be huge			0
the project is being led by @entity28 , which was recently awarded £ 171,495 ( $ 267,090 ) from the @entity29 to set up the ‘ smart ’ project in @entity31 , @entity10 ( marked ) professor @entity18 said : ' cities have been the focus of much of the boom in this type of technology , but the countryside faces challenges of its own , from environmental changes to flooding			1
' @entity8 is the idea everyday objects can be connected to the web			2
an example of a connected city is pictured professor @entity18 added : ‘ cities have been the focus of much of the boom in this type of technology - it has been used to keep traffic flowing on our roads , monitor air pollution and even help us find a parking spot on a busy saturday afternoon			0
‘ but the countryside faces challenges of its own , from subtle environmental changes to catastrophic events such as flooding			0
‘ the possibilities of bringing the @entity8 to the countryside are limitless			2
‘ the next step will be to identify exactly what will be of most use in the short term and how we will frame the project			0

*experts* are examining how @entity8 could work in the country
@entity28 will use £ 171,000 to make @entity31 in @entity10 ' smart '
digital collars could track animals , or double up as @entity99 hotspots
sensors fitted to riverbanks could monitor flood *threats* and water levels
computer scientists are running the project for the next 18 months
