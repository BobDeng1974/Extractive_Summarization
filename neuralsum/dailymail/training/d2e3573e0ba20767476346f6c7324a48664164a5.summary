by @entity0 @entity1 has put a ten day total ban on edits made from computers within the @entity5 after a series of changes on entries that promoted conspiracy theories or made humorous changes to notable people 's profiles			1
edits to the page of @entity15 claimed that he assassinated president @entity17 ' on behalf of the regime of @entity19 ' and former @entity21 defense secretary @entity20 is described as a ' lizard alien '			0
a representative from the @entity25 building said that the ban was caused by the actions of ' two or three ' and was drawn to attention by the @entity29 account , @ congressedits which automatically tweets page changes by ip address from within @entity5			1
banned : computers of the @entity5 have been banned from editing @entity1 for ten days the changes were brought to the attention of @entity1 administrators when an edit was made from a @entity39 for the website @entity41 , calling the media blog ' sexist ' and ' transphobic ' and alleging that it ' automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence			1
' the website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the @entity25 building			1
@entity49 , the founder of @entity1 , told the @entity50 that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has ' always gone and it always will			1
' however , he did say that the @entity29 feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits			0
assassin and lizard : some of the edits accuse @entity59 leader @entity19 of ordering the death of president @entity17 and former secretary of defense @entity61 of being a ' lizard ' ' there is a belief from some of the @entity66 that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks , and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them			0
' he added to the @entity50 : ' maybe someone at the @entity76 better think about their it staff - they might be hunting them down this very moment			0
' @entity1 can be edited by an user any time and anonymously , but the changes are monitored by the website 's volunteers , known as @entity66			2
they reverse rogue editing and sometimes ban users who continually change entries			0
it has emerged that @entity1 has been warning users from @entity5 since march 2012 and banned them for 10 days from thursday			2
since its creation only two weeks ago , the @ congressedits account has published more than 130 tweets , the vast majority of which highlight edits ranging from simple grammatical and the relative prettiness of hats in @entity5 according to the @entity102 .			0
