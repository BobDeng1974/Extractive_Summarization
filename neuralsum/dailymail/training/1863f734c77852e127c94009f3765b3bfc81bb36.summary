newsagents questioned by police over the sale of copies of @entity4 say they believe officers were given clear orders to seek customers ' details			1
forces across @entity10 have repeatedly denied ever instructing officers to make such inquiries , instead claiming their visits to stores were to ease community tensions			1
after a handful in @entity17 and @entity18 came forward to say they had faced such questions , police repeated their protestations			2
but shop owners and readers of the magazine have today slammed their reaction , saying they have been left ' outraged ' by having their claims dismissed			1
newsagents have expressed fury after police denied claims they instructed officers to demand the names of @entity4 readers			1
in one case a force categorically rejected the claim such questions had been asked among them is @entity38 , a newsagent in @entity40 who said she was ' angered and upset ' police had rejected her account of the story			1
' i think the police officers were told to come and ask , i think it was their mission , ' she told @entity48 today			2
' the way that they have denied it and claimed that they wanted to know about the sales for our own protection is rubbish			0
' i have n't seen any police around here at all since			0
i was working on my own at the time with a shop full of people when they came in			0
' they asked me who i sold the copies to and do they live in the area but as soon as they did i told them i would not be disclosing customers ' names			1
' i 've since had customers coming in and begging me not to tell anyone they 'd bought the magazine			1
' the whole thing has angered the community and left me and my husband upset			0
' the satirical magazine produced a special edition for its first issue after the attack			0
millions of extra copies were printed , with enthusiasts queuing outside shops in @entity80 ( above ) and @entity81 to purchase one one customer who bought the magazine said she did not see the difference in police requesting her details and those of people who bought @entity89 badges or marched in support of the victims of the @entity81 massacre last month ( above ) this morning a spokesman for @entity94 maintained its denial that such questions were asked , saying : ' we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded			1
' in @entity101 , another newsagent was allegedly contacted by a @entity102 over the phone and asked to share the name of a customer who pre-ordered the magazine 's special edition			1
he refused , instead sharing the conversation with the reader , @entity110 , the following day			0
when contacted by @entity48 this morning , mr @entity110 said : ' i did n't think too much of it at first but when i read about the one in @entity17 i thought something was very strange			0
' they 'd said the @entity102 was overzealous and had acted on her own and i thought " well that 's rubbish			1
" ' when i went to collect my copy , the newsagent told me straight away about how he had been phoned the night before and asked the same questions			0
' he did n't give my name so i did n't complain but now it 's being said the case in @entity17 was down to the officer , that 's just clearly not the case			0
' sir @entity125 , national police lead for preventing extremism , said officers who demanded the names of people who bought @entity4 in the wake of the @entity81 attacks appeared ' overzealous and unneccessary ' @entity135 's @entity134 team said no directive had ever been given to question newsagents or demand the names of customers who had bought the magazine but was investigating the gentleman 's claims			1
his comments were in reference to a pcso in @entity17 who , it was said yesterday , acted independently when she asked a store for the names of customers who purchased the publication			1
sir @entity125 , chief constable of @entity149 and the national head for preventing extremism , said the staff member involved had been ' overzealous '			1
' i understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary			2
' there was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed			1
' a customer of the newsagent denied the claim , telling @entity48 today : ‘ i certainly was n't under the impression the officer had gone in there of her own accord			2
' i do n’t think she did and she has been absolutely hung out to dry			0
' @entity171 , a pensioner who said she bought the magazine to support freedom of speech added : ' if they ’re going to ask for my name for buying the magazine they should be getting the names of all the people who bought @entity89 badges and turned out to march in @entity81			2
' i do n't see the difference between them			0
' freedom of speech campaigners slammed the police 's position in the row as ' unacceptable '			2
' this move by the police is entirely unacceptable			0
this sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed , but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication , ' @entity189 , director of @entity190 said			0
' it is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it			0
' considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in @entity81 by world leaders , that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged , the moves by the police in the @entity10 completely undermine that			2
' last month 11 members of staff at the @entity216 magazine 's officers were killed by @entity217 , sparking global outcry and support of freedom of speech			2
millions of issues of its ' survivor issue ' were produced , with queues forming outside newsagents selling the magazine across @entity227 .			0
