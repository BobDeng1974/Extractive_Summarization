by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 01:32 est , 4 december 2012 pop star @entity1 has attacked women in the music industry for acts that ' verge on porn ' and said female artists should ' have some self - respect '			1
the former @entity10 winner attacked her compatriots for allowing themselves to be ' sexually objectified '			2
she said it was ' fine to embrace your femininity and your sexiness but with some girl performers it verges on porn and that 's when i think , " what are you doing ? that 's gross			0
have some self - respect			2
" ' role model : @entity1 said that it was ' all about looks ' for most female acts in the music industry and she claimed that the reality show that made her name was one of the few exceptions , adding : ' the x factor is about voice and personality			1
but outside that , in this industry , for female artists it 's about looks			2
' however , 2010 's final of the show received more than 2,000 complaints to @entity43 after raunchy performances by @entity45 and @entity46			0
@entity46 wore a super-short black dress , while her female dancers , who were bent over chairs , wore suspenders , bra tops , fishnet stockings and basques in the raunchy routine			0
@entity45 's performance in a bra - top , pants and fishnets was judged by @entity43 as having ' some mildly sexual overtones and included images of her gyrating and rocking her buttocks '			0
@entity43 said that over one million young children were watching the live final , and 50,000 saw the repeat at 9.30am the following morning			0
the regulator warned afterwards that ' sexualised clothing and dance routines ' should not feature on programmes watched by children , and @entity71 promised to ' tone it down a bit '			0
raunchy : musician @entity75 performs onstage at the @entity76 held in @entity77 , @entity78 , last year on show : @entity75 in front of 45,000 adoring fans in the @entity82 of @entity83 , @entity84 do n't copy that ! @entity1 said she has been concerned to see her six - year - old goddaughter imitating suggestive dance routines , such as @entity46 's on the @entity10 final in 2010 an @entity43 statement said : ' we want to make sure that during family primetime shows , people are very much in safe territory and sticking to the rules			1
' speaking to a sunday newspaper yesterday , @entity1 insisted that she would like to be ' a positive force for young girls			0
' the hugely successful 27 - year - old added : ' i 'm not an angel			1
i mean - i have read and enjoyed @entity101 - but when i 'm making videos , 100 per cent of what influences me is , " would i be comfortable with my six - year - old goddaughter watching his ? " ' i 've seen her doing inappropriate raunchy dances from other videos she 's seen and i 'm like , " no , do n't do that			1
" ' inappropriate : @entity45 's appearance on the 2010 x factor final also prompted complaints - and now @entity1 has said she wants to see less focus on appearance for women in the music industry			1

she said there was too much focus on looks for women in the music industry
but the 27 - year - old @entity10 success story said the reality show was about ' voice and personality '
