he added : ‘ i do n’t think it is the right time to let go of the public finances at all			2
‘ we were always clear that this is what ’s called a structural deficit ; it does n’t go away just because growth is returning and the economy ’s coming back			0

it will be a minority and we do n't know how many it will be			0
' these strikes are based on ballots which are either with extremely low turnouts or , in some cases , with no recent ballot at all , ' he told @entity130			2
' the only teachers ' union calling a strike , the @entity134 , is relying on a mandate in a ballot that was called nearly two years ago			2
' taking action , which if it is effective is going to damage the interests of children and a load of hard - working parents who just want to be able to go to work that day ... it is really very irresponsible			0
' ‘ of course these are difficult decisions – we ’ve had that discussion many times – but they ’re absolutely necessary to in order to keep that plan on track and , as we can see with the wider economy , it ’s working			0
’ mr @entity7 insisted this was not just about the conservatives and the @entity157 and challenged @entity158 to condemn this week ’s strike			0
‘ the @entity158 leadership has said it ’s a test to their credibility that they support a squeeze on public sector pay			1
‘ in fact i look forward to them – they ought to come out and say very clearly that these strikes are wrong and that they ’re against the strikes and stop taking union money			0
’ but earlier @entity158 ’s shadow education secretary @entity172 refused to condemn the walkouts three times			0
he told @entity177 ’s @entity176 show : ‘ it ’s not up to me to tell trade unionists what to do – what i want is teachers in classrooms in a conversation with the secretary of state so we get over these kind of hurdles			0

i want all teachers in the schools teaching the young people , but we have independent trade unions in this country and that is an important part of civil society			2

she said : ‘ what firefighters , local government workers and health worker who are protesting too alongside teachers are saying is that this government is not listening , it ’s out of touch , people ca n’t keep going on having cuts in their living standards , depending on benefits			2
‘ what really sticks in the throat is the idea that money can be found to give tax cuts to billionaires , to millionaires and to big corporations , but it ca n’t be found to help , for example , the 500,000 workers in local government – dinner ladies , school meals workers , lollipop men and women – who are earning less than the minimum wage			0
’ @entity229 , acting general secretary of the @entity228 union , said : ' reports that the @entity231 are planning to ban public sector strikes and ratchet up their anti-union laws are nothing new and will meet the fiercest possible resistance			1
' the front line of defence against cuts and austerity is the organised working class and that is why the @entity231 and big business want to tighten the legal noose around our necks			0
they will have a fight on their hands			0
