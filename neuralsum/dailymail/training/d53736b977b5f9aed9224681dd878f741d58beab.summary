by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 18:29 est , 31 january 2014 credit card companies rake in £ 1.4billion a year by shrinking the minimum amount cardholders have to pay back credit card companies are quietly raking in an extra £ 1.4billion a year by shrinking the minimum amount cardholders have to pay back			1
around one in ten borrowers repays only the minimum sum requested every month and each now finds themselves more than £ 400 worse off each year			1
set by the bank and intended to help households manage their debts , minimum repayments are set at a percentage of the outstanding debt plus interest or £ 5 – whichever is the greater sum			1
in 2010 , the average was 2.15 per cent – today it is just 1.53 per cent , according to @entity18 , a credit card comparison website			0
based on the @entity22 ’s average £ 1,905 credit card debt , this adjustment costs a borrower an extra £ 411 in interest a year – and means it will take them two more years to clear their debts			1
in total , card firms are raking in an estimated extra £ 1.4billion a year from the 3.3million customers who pay only the minimum			0
@entity22 owe more than £ 55billion on credit cards – nearly three times as much as in 1998			1
@entity33 , chief executive of @entity18 said : ‘ many making the minimum repayment are never going to realise this has happened and are certainly never going to figure out how much it is going to cost them			0
‘ with lower minimum repayments , getting rid of that credit card debt could be a long and expensive process for borrowers			1
’ the repayments cover at least the interest on cardholders ’ debts , so the outstanding balance will fall each month			2
but the less customers repay , the longer it takes them to clear their debt , and the more interest the credit card company makes			2
if a borrower spends £ 2,000 on a credit card with interest at a typical 18.9 per cent and repays only a minimum 1pc plus interest , it would take 19 years and 10 months to clear what is owed			2
@entity22 owe more than £ 55billion on credit cards - nearly three times as much as in 1998 the total interest payable would be £ 2,551 on top of the original £ 2,000 debt			1
however , if the same customer repaid 5pc of the outstanding balance each month , they would pay just £ 287 in interest – and be free of debt in three years and 10 months			1
@entity68 , banking specialist at independent analysts @entity70 , said : ‘ this can cause real pain			0
if you ’re only making the minimum payment on your credit card each month , it could take years extra to clear your balance with all the extra interest			2
’ a spokesman for @entity82 consumer group said : ‘ whilst credit cards allow shoppers to have a bit of breathing space they will be shocked by the amount of time it will take to pay off relatively small amounts of purchases			0
‘ you should always aim to pay over the minimum required to substantially reduce your balance over time			0
’ @entity94 , head of card payments at the @entity96 , said customers were repaying more debt overall			0
‘ the average amount that cardholders repay each month has risen over the last two years , ’ he said			0
‘ cardholders now pay off 21pc of their outstanding bill in a month on average – up from 18pc in 2011			0
