the @entity0 and the @entity1 will meet again in the @entity2 , just a year after battling over seven games in one of the most thrilling finals in years			1
@entity1 took that one 4 - 3 to win their second successive @entity6 , but this year the @entity0 enter as slight favourites			1
@entity10 's team of @entity2 experts make their predictions			0
threepeat : @entity14 and the @entity1 are looking for a third successive title veteran : @entity17 , 38 , is looking for the fifth title of his @entity20 career june 5 : game one ( @entity22 1 , 2am ) june 8 : game two ( @entity22 1 , 1am ) june 10 : @entity24 three ( @entity22 1 , 2am ) june 12 : @entity24 four ( @entity22 1 , 2am ) june 15 : @entity24 five ( @entity22 1 , 1am ) * june 17 : @entity24 six ( @entity22 1 , 2am ) * june 20 : game seven ( @entity22 1 , 2am ) * * if necessary this is the series everyone was hoping for			1
the two best teams in the league by a distance go at it again in a replay of last year ’s epic finals			2
though the teams are largely the same there have been subtle changes that could end up being the deciding factors in this paper - thin contest			0
this series will be decided by the finest of margins			0
each team ’s ‘ @entity43 ’ - @entity0 ’s @entity17 , @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity1 ’s @entity14 , @entity46 and @entity47 - will ultimately decide the series			1
all six of these players are going to the @entity20 one day , while @entity14 and @entity17 are two of the top 10 ( maybe even top five ) players of all - time			1
fully fit : @entity46 is a lot healthier than he was in last year 's finals for @entity1 , @entity14 remains the best player in the @entity55 by some distance , perhaps even the most dominant athlete in any sport			1
wade , unlike last year , is back to full fitness and making a huge contribution , while @entity47 has recovered from early struggles to find his shooting			2
@entity17 might be 38 but he ’s performing better than those 10 years younger			0
@entity45 ripped the @entity63 apart with his shooting and vision in the @entity66 , but there is a question mark over @entity44 ’s hamstring			1
he ’ll need to be fully fit for the @entity0 to be firing			0
but if we assume that those six will be at their best then the spark will have to come from somewhere else			0
this is where @entity1 held the advantage last year , but that has swung in favour of the @entity0 this time round			1
shot 's off : @entity81 is not shooting as well as he did in 2013 the @entity1 ’s reserves , so crucial in their championship win last time , are performing slightly worse than they did , while the @entity0 can rely on an improved bench			1
@entity81 can still be relied on to make the big shots but he is a non-factor on defence and his shot is n’t finding the mark as often as it did in 2013			0
@entity90 is a huge help off the bench , but he is carrying a niggling thigh injury			0
@entity94 has completely lost his shot , and while @entity95 has taken his place to good effect , the @entity1 miss the shooting of @entity99 , who departed at the start of the season			0
@entity1 ’s starters have been logging huge minutes in this year ’s play - offs , so the @entity0 should look to strike when they are getting their rest			1
star in the making : @entity107 can guard @entity14 as well as any player in the @entity2 the @entity0 ’ role players are the best in the @entity2			1
@entity107 is a star in the making and will do as good a job as anybody in the league in defending @entity14			0
@entity115 set a @entity2 record last year with his three - point shooting , while the @entity0 can also rely on @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 to provide scoring from the bench			1
the other crucial factor is @entity0 has home court advantage this year , not the @entity1			1
playing in front of your home crowd in a potential championship decider will make a huge amount of difference			0
just like last year this will be one of the best @entity2 ever and it is almost impossible to separate two extremely evenly matched teams			0
i think the @entity0 will edge it in seven , just because in a series this tight having home court advantage will be huge			2
but i wo n’t be going anywhere near a bookies for this one			0
role players : the likes of @entity118 will have to have an impact off the bench for the @entity0 to win it ’s as simple as this : @entity0 should have won last year			1
the @entity0 are better than last season			0
the @entity1 are not as good as they were			0
the way @entity0 have bounced back from their heartbreaking @entity2 defeat has been nothing short of brilliant			0
it looked for all money like @entity17 had missed his chance for an elusive fifth crown , but his @entity0 charge are back , better than ever			1
all this excellent season for the @entity0 needs now is another championship banner hanging at the @entity157			0
@entity158 : @entity44 has been suffering with a slight hamstring injury the major difference has been the excellent bench led by @entity45 and @entity119 , who has looked so comfortable in a @entity0 jersey since his switch from @entity164			1
the @entity1 are not quite the force they were last year			2
of course , they ’re still one of the very best in the league and have the no 1 player in the game in @entity14			0
if motivation is the issue , then there wo n’t be a problem			0
@entity1 will raise their game for the occasion with the incentive a third title in a row			2
@entity14 will also up things a notch and , with @entity183 ’s season over , look to prove that he is the best			0
key man : @entity45 is much fitter than he was last year and was brilliant against the @entity63 but , when @entity14 is in a lull and the rotations are in full swing , i expect the @entity0 ’ depth to be too much for the @entity1			1
the teams will share the opening two games , and the @entity0 will also snatch a road victory in @entity1 , leaving the series tied 2 - 2			1
after winning game five at home , @entity0 will find themselves in exactly the same position as last season , 3 - 2 up on the road			2
this time , there will be no missed rebound , no magic @entity81 three - pointer to force overtime , and no @entity1 getting out of jail			2
@entity0 will show why they had such an excellent road record during the regular - season			2
spurs to win in six , and dethrone the back - to - back champions on their home court			0
big impact : @entity47 re-found his scoring touch against the @entity213 a chance for revenge versus the opportunity to make more history			0
that ’s what is at stake in this year ’s @entity2 as the @entity0 take on the @entity1			1
in a repeat of last year ’s series showpiece , which @entity1 won 4 - 3 , expect another equally close and pulsating best - of - seven encounter but this time with a different outcome			1
the way @entity0 bounced back from their agonising loss to @entity1 last season has been mightily impressive			2
mastermind : @entity0 coach @entity229 has created the most beautiful offence in the @entity2 the best team in the @entity2 – this has been proven with their no 1 seed in the @entity235 play - offs following a regular season record of 62 - 20			2
in coach @entity229 , they have someone who knows how to win having guided this franchise to five previous @entity2 appearances			0
what has been most striking about the @entity0 is their ability to score from the bench			0
in their @entity247 clincher at the @entity63 , the @entity0 ’ replacements scored 51 points in comparison to @entity63 's five – with the 46 - point differential in bench scoring the largest in any game this season			2
enforcer : @entity90 is a key big man for the @entity1 but he is struggling with a thigh problem this reason alone is why the @entity0 should be the favourites for the series			1
for @entity1 coach @entity258 he is not only looking at trying to contain the all - star starting talents of @entity44 and @entity17 ; but also the threats of @entity45 and @entity119 who can score three - pointers for fun			1
undoubtedly @entity1 ’s ' big 3 ' of @entity47 , @entity46 and @entity14 will play a huge factor in this series but they themselves can not solely win it for the @entity1 on their own			1
four - time mvp @entity14 would dearly love to make the 2014 @entity2 the year of the “ three - peat ” and again has been his team ’s focal point as they progressed through the @entity272 play - offs			2
maligned : @entity1 coach @entity258 still has critics despite taking the @entity1 to the finals in four straight years home court advantage is also likely to play a factor with @entity0 having won all four of their previous @entity2 when they ’ve held this privilege			1
however , over the last four years the @entity1 have played in 15 play - off series and recorded road wins every time			2
expect both sides to secure away triumphs but the @entity0 to edge it in seven in front of their own fans at the @entity157 for a sweet vengeance .			0

@entity0 face the @entity1 in a replay of last year 's finals
the @entity1 won a thrilling 2013 series 4 - 3
spurs enter this series as very slight favourites
@entity14 , @entity46 and @entity47 hoping to threepeat
@entity17 , @entity44 and @entity45 looking for their fifth title
