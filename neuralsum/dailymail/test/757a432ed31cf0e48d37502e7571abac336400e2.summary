as the anniversary of their daughter 's suicide approaches , @entity3 and @entity4 have spoken of their battle to have the two teenage boys , who they say bullied their daughter to death , held accountable for their actions under cyber bullying laws			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , was 19 when she took her own life on @entity17 last year , after receiving @entity19 messages from two teenage boys she considered friends saying that they hated her , and that she was a ' f * * * ing sook '			1
her parents said that @entity13 's social media accounts were flooded with horrible sentiments the night before she died , and are now desperate to see a change within @entity15 ’s @entity27 and the state 's police so that those found guilty of cyber bullying face serious consequences			1
the parents of @entity13 ( pictured ) are campaigning for anti-bullying laws to be taken more seriously ' what we would like to see happen is that if someone is cyber bullying somebody and they cause something like this , then they should be held ­ accountable for it , ' said @entity13 's father @entity3			1
on @entity17 last year , @entity13 told her her mother that she was going for a run			2
her sister @entity47 became concerned after seeing an @entity49 photo @entity13 uploaded with the caption ' i love this place and i am never going to leave '			0
@entity13 's father found her body on the sunday in the same place where the photo had been taken			0
the @entity56 's said that @entity13 was a vibrant and and outgoing girl , who was looking forward to her gap year and had never exhibited symptoms of depression or mental illness before the two former friends began bullying her online			2
coroner @entity63 said in the report she released in october that @entity13 's death highlighted the impact that social media could have on the lives on young people , and that both @entity19 and text messaging was ' problematic ' for the teenager			0
' easy access to the internet on her phone meant that she was exposed to potentially upsetting communications 24 hours a day ; and she was able to return to , and re-read , the upsetting messages at a later time and therefore appears to have continued to ruminate about them , ' the coroners report said			2
' although it is not possible to identify , with any degree of certainty , the factors contributing to a person 's decision to take their own life , it is evident that messages received by @entity13 online proximate to her death ... were precipitating factors , ' reported the @entity92			0
@entity13 ( pictured right , with her sister @entity47 , left ) committed suicide after she was bullied over @entity19 following the release of the coroners report , the @entity56 's are now campaigning to see cyber bullying taken more seriously in @entity15 and around @entity97			1
@entity15 already has anti-bullying legislation known as @entity99 , which was introduced in 2011 after the death of @entity101 , who committed suicide after being subject to relentless bullying in her workplace			1
the crime is punishable by ten years in jail , and applies to cyber bullying as well as physical , verbal and psychological bullying			1
despite these laws , and the finding of the coroner who named the two teenage boys , there has been no charges and no inquest into @entity13 's death , which the @entity118 's labelled as a failure			0
police also failed to produce a warrant to obtain communication between @entity13 and her bullies from @entity19 and @entity124			0
the @entity56 's said that they were disappointed with the @entity15 police for failing to investigate and want to see the teenagers held accountable for their actions			0
' if you accidentally hit someone in your car you can get manslaughter			0
what ’s the difference if you bully someone and cause them to take their own life ? ' , @entity13 's mother @entity133 told @entity140 - @entity139 ' they keep saying they ’re going to have a big push on cyber bullying and try to knock it on the head , but it seems like it ’s too much hard work			2
' @entity13 's grandmother wrote of the impact of the 19 - year - old 's death on the family , and called for harsher enforcement of the anti-bullying legislation			2
' it seems there is a law in @entity15 that criminalises cyber bullying , but it does n't get enforced because of the police paperwork ... cyber bullying is a silent killer of too many of our young ones , ' she wrote			1
' we have the evidence ... but where 's the justice ? ' if you or someone you know is struggling with mental illness or depression , please contact lifeline on 13 11 14 .			0
