footage shot at the scene clearly shows officers firing live ammunition from automatic weapons and handguns taking cover : protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer the mass killing of the strikers at the marikana mine in august was one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994			2
the arrested miners were charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a ' common purpose ' in the murder of their co-workers			2
the @entity103 , whose members used to be gunned down by apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws , has been severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in power			2

he said the decision to charge the miners was a setback for democracy			0
violence : a mine worker is pictured licking his spear at @entity143 platinum mine in @entity2 , where police opened fire on striking miners armed with machetes and sticks bloody scenes : the shooting was one of the worst in @entity2 since the end of the apartheid era @entity112 is facing re-election as the @entity103 's leader in december and poor management of the shooting would strengthen his opponents who see him as running an ineffectual government			0
he has ordered an investigation into the responsibility of police , @entity129 and the feuding unions that caused the strike at @entity143			0
the panel 's report is due a month after the @entity103 vote			0
@entity112 has made little progress on his main policies since taking office in 2009 , with unemployment increasing , corruption perceived to be getting worse and the gap between rich and poor - already among the worst in the world - growing wider			0
many striking miners have avoided pointing fingers at @entity112 so far , preferring to criticise @entity129 and the @entity209 ( @entity209 ) for not doing enough to help them			0
' i blame the management of the company			1
they are the ones who called out the police			0
