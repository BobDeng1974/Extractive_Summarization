by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 8 december 2013 will @entity1 qualify from tough @entity2 in @entity3 ? after upsetting the mayor of @entity8 earlier in the week , @entity6 ’s @entity5 fears have been realised			1
@entity1 have had a mare			2
jungle fever has already set in as @entity6 prepares to head up to this tropical city buried deep in northern @entity3 ’s rainforests for their opening group game			1
@entity6 as good as caused a diplomatic incident earlier in the week when he called @entity8 ‘ the place ideally to avoid ’			1
the city ’s mayor @entity16 subsequently released a statement accusing @entity6 of lacking ‘ education and culture ’			2
tough draw : @entity23 chairman @entity22 gave his immediate reaction to the news that @entity1 would face @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 with a throat - slitting gesture nightmare scenes : the @entity23 chairman made the gesture while sitting next to boss @entity6 in the auditorium @entity33 @entity3 @entity34 @entity35 @entity36 @entity37 @entity38 @entity39 @entity40 @entity41 @entity42 @entity43 @entity44 @entity45 @entity46 @entity2 @entity27 @entity28 @entity1 @entity26 @entity47 @entity48 @entity49 @entity50 @entity51 @entity52 @entity53 @entity55 - @entity54 @entity56 @entity57 @entity58 @entity59 @entity60 @entity61 @entity62 @entity63 @entity64 @entity65 @entity66 @entity67 here she comes : @entity3 actress @entity69 takes to the stage as @entity71 addresses the audience full house : @entity3 president @entity74 and @entity71 are flanked by @entity75 and @entity69 @entity8 has a population of 1.7m and @entity1 will discover that most of them will now be supporting @entity26 when the teams emerge from the tunnel on june 15			1
the boos that will ring out when they step out of the @entity81 will confirm it			0
@entity6 has made a big tactical mistake with the people of @entity8			1
he tried in vain to clear up this dog ’s dinner after the draw forced @entity1 north , but the damage has been done			2
from there they will head down to @entity92 , via their base in @entity94 for a few days , to play @entity27 on june 19			1
it sounds awful to say this but , by the time @entity1 arrive in @entity98 for the final group game against the group outsiders , @entity28 , five days later , it is possible they will be destined for an early flight out of @entity3			1
they have been pitched in with a group of bad boys : @entity26 ’s @entity105 and @entity27 ’s @entity106 will be up against @entity107 and @entity108 before too long			1
it does n’t seem fair			0
@entity106 , with 39 goals in 76 appearances for his country , scored four in the week for @entity113 against @entity114			2
the boy loves a goal			0
getting shirty : @entity105 will line up for @entity26 while @entity106 's @entity27 will lie in wait for @entity1 the @entity118 : @entity1 have been drawn with @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity26 a whole load of travel : the three stadiums in @entity3 that @entity1 will play their games but this is it for @entity6 , time to start earning his corn as @entity1 ’s manager and getting past the mother of all @entity5 groups			1
@entity6 spoke earlier in the week of his fears about the rainforests and the steaming heat will not suit @entity1 ’s game			1
the humidity of @entity8 is not an excuse for @entity1 to wilt like wall flowers against @entity136 opposition when we get underway here in @entity3			1
chances to play in a @entity5 in the motherland come around every 50 - odd years and they have ample time to prepare for the steam and sweat up in the north			2
the kick - off time has been scheduled for 9pm ( 2am in @entity145 ) , when conditions will be cooler			2
it will not be easy , but nobody ever won a @entity5 by fluking their way towards a final			2
‘ to be frank there were n’t many scenarios where i would have been jumping for joy , ’ added @entity6			2
‘ there is a lot of travelling to be done in most of the groups			0
but our great advantage is being based in @entity94 means we have only one long trip			0
’ the key moment : @entity1 were drawn in @entity2 they will face @entity28 in their final match ( below ) @entity162 : ' tough looking group for @entity1 but some exciting games to look forward to ... @entity60 - @entity165 and @entity38 - @entity39 in particular			1
' @entity166 : ' @entity167 , @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity66			0
interesting but tricky because there is no hiding for us , next round is a must			0
# @entity167 ' @entity173 : ' tough group ... but so what ? if we want to win it we will have to play the best teams anyway ! ! ' @entity179 : brother it 's time again ... that 's how beautiful life is ! ! ca n't wait ... love u bro ! ! ! @ @entity184 @entity186 : ' all games are tough at the @entity5 , chance is there to progress ! now we know , let the headlines start ! # @entity191 ' @entity192 : ' exciting group , looking forward to our first game @entity195 # @entity39 # @entity196 ' @entity197 : buzzing about our draw ! opening game at the @entity200 ! looking forward to it big time			1
let 's do it ! @entity204 : ' @entity205 and @entity51 for us ! ! ! ' @entity207 : ' tough group for @entity1			1
can not see them getting out of that			0
' @entity26 , who knocked @entity1 out of @entity211 on penalties , will find the conditions in @entity8 just as tough			1
@entity215 ’s team are old hands at tournament football , wily competitors with the know - how to get through tight spots			0
plucking balls from the pots yesterday was their 2006 @entity5 - winning captain @entity222			2
how they would love to call on him			0
instead @entity1 have another meeting with @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and that beast @entity105			0
that ’s a massive game for @entity1 and the clash against @entity27 will be another showstopper			1
they will head to a city where the traffic never moves and it is here that @entity1 ’s @entity5 campaign could come to a standstill			1
somehow , @entity27 threatened to make a mess of qualification until they ran into @entity240 in the play - offs and thumped them 5 - 0 on aggregate			2
@entity6 ’s side will have to contain two players that he elevated into the category of ‘ world class ’ following the draw here			1
he knows all about @entity106 , of course , and there is the added threat of @entity252 forward @entity253			0
beyond that it ’s @entity28 , where former @entity256 and @entity257 striker @entity255 is the assistant coach			0
@entity6 will know precious little about them at this moment in time , other than they lost 1 - 0 against @entity262 in @entity263 last month			2
it ’s a tough group for @entity1 , but that ’s the law of the jungle			1
bring on the @entity5 ! the new @entity267 balls with the names of the teams in @entity2 suit and tie : @entity272 arrives for the final draw as , right , @entity1 boss @entity6 takes his seat @entity50 fancy : @entity277 legend @entity276 , who won the @entity5 in 1998 , was among the attendees legend : @entity3 superstar @entity279 was asked to take part in the draw , but turned the opportunity down @entity285 boss @entity284 , speaking to @entity283 , said @entity1 have a great chance of winning the @entity5			1
he said : they have a really good chance			0
the development of the @entity290 footballer is better			0
they are tactically aware and have become thinkers			0
' on their day they can beat anyone			0
@entity1 are ready now to earn that belief in a big tournament			0
' are you ready ? @entity6 will have been hoping for a favourable draw in his first @entity5 as @entity1 boss arriving in style : @entity299 president @entity71 arrived in style for friday 's @entity5 draw heading to @entity94 : @entity1 booked their place at the @entity5 with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity303 at @entity304 we 've done it : @entity113 captain @entity307 will lead @entity1 at next summer 's finals in @entity3 @entity309 former @entity26 forward and team manager for 25 years said : ‘ it 's a difficult group , it is important start good			1
@entity1 are strong team but it 's not like the team they were before			2
’ @entity215 @entity316 coach : ‘ our group is the most difficult			0
it is the group of three world champions and we need to do the maximum to qualify but i do n’t worry			0
the most important thing is arrive ready in @entity3			0
' i 'm worried when the @entity316 press says " it ’s easy "			0
the weather is the only problem , not the opponent teams			0
the hardest match ? against @entity28 because we do n't now this team			0
’ @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity1 and @entity26 : the four teams that will battle it out in @entity2 the big screen : @entity335 vents his anger after @entity1 were held to a 0 - 0 draw by @entity65 at the 2010 @entity5 going home : @entity1 were sent crashing out by @entity165 in the second round after a 4 - 1 defeat @entity1 v @entity26 , june 14 ( 11pm ) - @entity8 as the name of the stadium suggests , @entity8 is located bang in the middle of the @entity347 rainforest			1
@entity8 is hardly a hotbed of football , but organisers felt it was important to take the @entity5 to all four corners of the country despite fears the stadium will become a white elephant once the tournament ends			1
humidity can reach 99 per cent during june and july			1
@entity27 v @entity1 , june 19 ( 8pm ) - @entity92 serious doubts have emerged about the stadium which is due to host the opening match of the tournament after a crane collapsed on the site last week , killing two workers			1
@entity92 is the spiritual birthplace of football in @entity3 , but its unpredictable weather may turn off visitors			2
the south - eastern city is known as the @entity368 ( @entity369 ) because of the almost incessant rain that falls there			0
a bit like @entity3 ’s version of @entity374			0
@entity28 v @entity1 , june 24 ( 5pm ) - @entity98 venue for one of the semi-finals , @entity98 ’s biggest stadium has undergone a complete overhaul since @entity3 won the right to host the @entity5			1
@entity381 used to grace the surface of the @entity383 when he started his career with @entity385			0
located just an hour ’s flight from @entity94 , @entity98 is a more affordable option for travelling fans			1
temperatures will be in the mid- 20s , and there will be little humidity .			0

@entity1 will face @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 after being drawn in @entity2
@entity6 's side will open their campaign in @entity8 , where temperatures can reach over 30 degrees , on june 15 ( that 's 2am for the fans back home )
@entity8 is a five - and - a - half hour flight from @entity1 's base in @entity94 and is located in the @entity347 rain forest , with 99 per cent humidity
the @entity1 will then travel to @entity92 to face @entity106 's @entity27 on june 19 before facing @entity28 in their final group clash five days later
manager @entity6 admits @entity1 have been dealt a ' tough group '
@entity23 chairman @entity22 makes throat - slitting gesture after draw is made
hosts @entity3 will face @entity34 in the opening game of the @entity5
*holders* @entity38 have been drawn against @entity39 in a repeat of the 2010 final
