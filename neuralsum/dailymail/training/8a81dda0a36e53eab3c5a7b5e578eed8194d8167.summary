by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 will fly from his home in @entity4 to next weekend 's race in @entity6 with an untroubled 29 - point lead in the @entity10 drivers ' championship to show for his controversial driving in last sunday 's @entity13 @entity12			1
to the @entity15 's critics , the six - figure fine imposed by his @entity17 team after his second - lap crash with title rival and team - mate @entity20 is scant punishment : he is a multi-millionaire for whom donating a fraction of his earnings to charity is a minuscule price to pay			1
but @entity26 , the former president of motor racing 's governing body , the @entity27 , believes @entity17 did @entity2 a disservice by divulging that they were disciplining him for a crash that ended @entity20 's race while he went on to finish second			1
made up ? @entity17 team - mates @entity20 and @entity2 will continue racing next week in @entity6 @entity33 : former @entity27 president @entity26 believes it was not right to go public regarding @entity2 's fine private matter : @entity26 ( centre ) believes the fine should have been dealt with privately by @entity17 1 @entity2 - 220 2 @entity20 - 191 3 @entity39 - 156 4 @entity40 - 121 5 @entity41 - 110 6 @entity42 - 98 ' in every respect but one i think @entity17 dealt with the incident in the right way , ' said @entity26			1
' if they decided to fine or punish @entity2 they should not have announced it			1
it 's as if the team are blaming him publicly			2
that 's not really right			0
' many observers suggested the @entity27 should have investigated after @entity20 claimed @entity2 admitted he had deliberately caused the incident at @entity55 as they sparred for the lead			1
it was said that @entity26 's @entity27 , which was proactive to an occasionally mischievous degree , would have intervened in contrast to the more passive regime of the current president , former @entity62 team principal @entity61			1
winging it : @entity2 's @entity17 collided with @entity20 's car at @entity65 , forcing the @entity66 to retire costly : @entity2 eventually finished second after the crash , meaning @entity20 is 29 points behind but @entity26 , who was in charge from 1993 to 2009 , disagrees			1
he said : ' the way i see it — and i 'm on the outside now — is that the very experienced race director [ @entity75 ] and the stewards decided to act because it was a ' racing incident '			2
' that was more or less that			0
it was a minor incident with serious consequences			0
what the drivers did or not say afterwards is not clear			0
on that basis the @entity27 could not get involved			0
' it 's then a matter for the team			2
a lot goes on behind closed doors			0
what is unusual is announcing it			0
personally , i would n't have done that			0
' @entity2 's fine was the upshot of a two - hour meeting between the drivers and their bosses , @entity99 and @entity100 , at in @entity101 on friday			1
' gutted ' : @entity20 was left distraught for his team after the contact with his @entity17 team - mate @entity2 booed : @entity2 was jeered when he took to the podium to claim his second - place prize in @entity13 contender : @entity39 ( centre ) won the last gp at @entity65 and is closing in on the @entity17 duo for the title with @entity17 ' management having been criticised for perceived naivety this season , their hard line must be interpreted , at least in part , as an attempt to show @entity20 , their boardroom and the public that they have reasserted their authority			1
it has been suggested @entity2 could be forced to yield position , either in a future qualifying session or a grand prix , or even be handed a race ban			1
but @entity99 rejected such speculation , saying : ' the team discussed at length what the consequences could be			2
' but there is one thing we stand for at @entity134 , and this is racing , straight and fair racing , and we remain committed to that			1
both drivers are racing at the absolute limit against each other , and we are not going to interfere in the race result , or pre-agree any race result			2
this is not what we will ever do			0
' when the racing happens we need to react sometimes , but we will not pre-agree in favour of one or the other			0
this is not what we do			0
' the effectiveness of @entity17 ' action will be seen in the closing seven races			2
' the proof of the pudding will be in the eating , ' admitted a team insider			0
next course , @entity6 .			0

the @entity15 ' acknowledged ' his role in the crash on lap 2 of the @entity13 gp
he has since issued an *apology* to the @entity17 team and @entity20
@entity20 has said ' it would be *wrong* to point *fingers* ' in a *statement*
@entity26 believes the public nature of the fine is *unfair* on @entity2
*mercedes* have said they ' remain committed to hard , fair racing '
