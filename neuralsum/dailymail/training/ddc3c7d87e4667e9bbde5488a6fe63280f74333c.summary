@entity0 has seen off a bid to build 15 new homes overlooking her sprawling £ 5million neo-georgian palace after saying the development would ‘ ruin the village ’			1
she complained to planning bosses saying the development - which included five affordable homes - would damage the ‘ special landscape ’ around the mansion she shares with @entity12 in @entity13			1
but the @entity14 has been accused of hypocrisy after she bulldozed the original 1930s @entity17 mansion and replaced it with ' @entity18 ' - complete with pink - interior swimming pool			2
she was backed by almost 60 neighbours , including former @entity23 defender @entity22 's wife @entity21 and @entity26 rocker @entity25 's wife @entity24			0
in a letter , mrs @entity0 , 28 , said : ‘ let ’s not ruin our village			1
the development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land			0
' the development will mean more car journeys into the village , which is already congested and unsuitable for the increased traffic			0
it will damage the special landscape , character and appearance of the area			2
’ the plans , put forward by @entity50 , included five ' affordable ' homes , with one of the builds visible from the end of her drive			1
@entity0 , wife of @entity56 and @entity23 captain @entity57 , wrote an angry letter to the council about the plans @entity61 columns and gold bath taps are said to grace the interior of the @entity0 's house and the 20 acres of grounds are surrounded by high perimeter walls studded with security cameras			1
the three - storey mansion also boasts a swimming pool , @entity70 , gym , cinema			2
@entity73 , a surveyor who advised developers @entity74 , says : ‘ there is a contradiction			0
the @entity82 ’ house is like a mini office building and it seems slightly strange that they should object to what is a very sympathetic development on adjoining land			0
’ mrs @entity0 grew up in rough area of @entity86 in @entity87 with a her mother who worked as a nursery nurse			1
the plans to build 15 new homes were rejected by @entity32 's planning committee the plans , put forward by @entity50 , included five ' affordable ' homes , with one of the builds visible from the end of mrs @entity0 's drive @entity99 rocker @entity25 's wife @entity24 also complained to the council , saying it was necessary to preserve the character of the historic village			1
the holders are long - standing residents of @entity17 and live on the same secluded cul - de - sac as the @entity107			0
mrs @entity108 said : ' i can see no ' very special circumstances ' that would be the only way to justify the destruction of this green belt area for the purpose of building any number of new houses			2
@entity17 is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting			0
' the @entity13 village , a few miles north of @entity121 , is one of the richest places outside the @entity125 of @entity56 - part of a triangle of wealth formed with the nearby settlements of @entity130 and @entity131			0
mrs @entity0 grew up in a rough area of @entity86 in @entity87 , but has objected to ' affordable ' homes being built @entity0 objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would ' ruin ' her village			1
