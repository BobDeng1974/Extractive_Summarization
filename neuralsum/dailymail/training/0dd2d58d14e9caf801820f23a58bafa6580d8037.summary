@entity1 's tuesday columnist puts his neck on the line in forecasting what he believes will happen in a season that could prove to be the most intriguing @entity7 campaign yet , as well as predicting outcomes in the @entity9 and @entity10 plus @entity12 's fortunes in the @entity14 qualifiers			1
@entity15 will score 30 - plus goals - providing he stays fit			1
the confidence he has built up in the past 12 months at @entity18 and the physical power he can now add to his talents will see him take his game to another level			1
the players around will help of course , but it would n’t surprise me if @entity18 won both the @entity9 and @entity10 , with @entity15 taking centre stage			1
the @entity28 netted 15 times last season ; double it and more this year			2
@entity30 to watch @entity15 in training with @entity32 and @entity33 hitman : @entity18 's @entity15 practises free kicks during a training session on monday all smiles : @entity15 is back in the @entity39 capital for the @entity40 against @entity41 on tuesday night @entity42 will have his best ever season at @entity44			1
i ’m not just talking about the amount of goals he will score , i ’m talking about his all - round game			2
he will score and create , and he will flourish under a world class manager who believes in him			0
show us what you can do , @entity42			1
time to shine ! @entity42 should flourish in a @entity44 shirt under new boss @entity56 knows where the net is ! @entity42 looks like to pile in with goals and assists at @entity61 this season @entity63 favourite for captaincy @entity65 will get sent off at least twice			1
he will be a marked man , referees will be watching closely – nobody will want to be the man in the middle who misses the fourth bite - and opponents in @entity72 will be as masterful of the dark arts of football as @entity65 is			1
he ’s got off lightly in @entity12 – this wo n’t happen in a @entity77 shirt			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity78 will win nothing			1
with the squad they had , and the changes at other clubs , @entity78 should have won the title by 10 - 12 points last season , but in the end only clinched it because @entity88 dropped points late in the campaign against @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , while @entity95 lost to @entity88 and slipped up at @entity92			1
@entity96 gets his sides playing decent football , but that can only take you so far			1
on sunday he changed nothing when @entity102 were outplaying the champions from the first minute			0
the unhappiness of @entity105 this summer has smacked of everything that was wrong with the latter part of the @entity109 era at the @entity110			1
and his handling of the goalkeeper situation is nothing short of bizarre			0
i ’ll be fascinated to see who is in between the sticks for @entity78 on the opening weekend , but i know that whoever misses out wo n’t be happy			1
@entity119 does n’t deserve to be dropped ; @entity120 will wonder why he ’s been signed after playing every minute of every game in @entity10 last season			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity123 will be a joy to watch			0
when @entity126 arrived at @entity127 the dressing room was in an appalling state			0
last season he worked with a backdrop of financial pressure to get promoted			2
he may not have done it in style , but @entity126 took @entity123 back to the top flight			0
now with the pressure off , @entity135 on the staff and with most of the high - earning wasters away from the club , @entity126 can get @entity123 playing similarly to @entity139 when they were ripping teams to shreds in the @entity9			2
results may not always go their way , but @entity127 should be good value this season			2
all smiles : @entity65 completed a £ 75million move from @entity95 to @entity77 after the @entity148 tougher time : the defenders in @entity10 should be more adept at playing the striker at his own game will we see this again ? @entity78 are going to struggle to retain their @entity7 crown resolved ? @entity105 's unhappiness at the @entity110 will be a growing concern for those at the club trepidation : @entity96 has his side playing good football but they appear to have gone backwards awful : city were completely outplayed by @entity102 at @entity165 in the @entity166 on sunday gliding : @entity167 moves beyond @entity168 in @entity123 's friendly against @entity169 on saturday @entity12 will lose to @entity170 next month in their opening @entity14 qualifier			1
i have no doubts they will qualify , but @entity12 have lost their captain at a time when leadership is needed			1
i ’m sure @entity178 will have his own regrets about his international career , but he ’s been excellent in qualifiers and will be missed			2
some of the @entity12 squad think the @entity148 was positive for @entity12 , so i wonder how much time they ’ve actually spent thinking about how they could have done better for their country			1
for me , off the back of a record - breakingly bad @entity148 , and against a @entity170 side who impressed me in @entity190 , i can only see @entity12 losing			1
i ’ve booked time off and paid for my tickets so it wo n’t stop me going to the game to support my country , but i just ca n’t help thinking we will slip up			0
the question then will focus on @entity200 ’s future			0
bad to worse : @entity12 were humiliated at the @entity148 but could struggle against @entity170 too @entity88 will win the title			1
if they do n’t then @entity202 has really lost his powers			2
he ’s been allowed to sign two talismanic players in @entity205 and @entity206 , to fill two key roles in the team			0
@entity88 should have won it last season , this time around there are no excuses			1
so far in his career @entity202 has proved he is a more successful manager than @entity96 , so with the squad the @entity214 has the title should be heading to @entity217			1
big year : @entity202 should deliver the @entity7 title with the players at his disposal like the kid who stayed in uniform and watched from the sidelines while the rest of us took part in school sports day , @entity139 will once again be admiring the successful sides next season			1
i respect what @entity231 did at @entity233 – they were good to watch			0
and if he is given time he may do something decent at @entity237			0
but i ’ll be amazed if it ’s this season			2
there is a lot of work to do at @entity139 and i ’m shocked @entity231 has n’t gone back to @entity233 for some players			0
@entity243 and @entity244 are two who would surely have improved @entity139			0
he ’s a miracle worker if he takes them into the top four			0
@entity231 wasted a golden opportunity in the @entity249 with @entity233 last season by fielding a weakened side and losing at @entity94 in the fifth round , so if he takes that philosophy to @entity139 they wo n’t be doing anything in the cups this season			2
in the short - term it will be same old @entity139			0
but beyond that , if they stick with @entity231 , it could be fruitful			0
job on his hands : @entity231 will find life tough as @entity139 manager in his first season worth the money : @entity139 should have moved for @entity95 's @entity269 defender @entity243 ( left ) @entity270 will be going down			1
it will be one of the @entity7 ’s real special achievements if @entity273 keeps them up			2
they ended last season winning three of their final four games			0
before that they enjoyed just one victory in 12			0
losing one key player this summer was a blow			0
losing three could be disastrous			0
@entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 have led the exodus			0
they have been big players for the @entity293 and they will all be missed			0
if @entity295 also leaves , @entity294 wo n’t have a prayer			0
big miss : @entity286 has left @entity270 for a season - long loan spell at @entity299 tricky time ahead : @entity273 will know he faces a battle to keep the @entity293 in the top flight @entity56 will have his fair share of touchline spats			1
he ’s a guy with a sense of humour but in the heat of the battle he could ’ve fallen out with @entity308			0
most likely to wind up the @entity309 are @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity202			1
sit back and enjoy ! @entity312 : @entity56 ( right , sat next to @entity313 ) likes to express himself on the touchline			2

@entity88 should win the @entity7 , not @entity78
@entity42 will have his best season at @entity44
@entity65 got off lightly at @entity95 - he *'ll* see red more at @entity77
@entity105 's unhappiness will prove a problem for @entity96
@entity18 superstar @entity15 set for his best season yet
@entity202 , @entity56 and @entity311 will do battle
@entity12 will lose against @entity170 in the @entity14 qualifiers
