' ' what a great day ! ' the father said as witnesses turned to leave the death house			0
@entity12 ' lawyers had made a plea to the @entity4 earlier in the day after a federal appeals court on wednesday allowed the execution to remain on schedule			1
a lower court had stopped the execution wednesday , ordering the @entity44 to reveal more information about its drug supplier , but the ruling was quickly tossed on appeal			1
@entity12 , who claims to have committed as many as 70 killings across the @entity5 , also lost an appeal before the high court that contended his case should be reviewed because he had poor legal help during his murder trial			1
victims : @entity31 ( left ) , 13 , was killed in her own bed by @entity12 , and her friend @entity57 ( right ) almost died after he slashed her throat in their drug argument , @entity12 ' attorneys argued they needed to know the name of the pharmacy now providing the state with pentobarbital used during executions in order to verify the drug 's quality and protect @entity12 from unconstitutional pain and suffering			1
but the @entity4 , like the 5th @entity70 , sided with @entity3 prison officials , who argued that information about the drug supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of violence			1

questions about the source of execution drugs have arisen in several states in recent months as numerous drugmakers - particularly in @entity107 , where opposition to capital punishment is strongest - have refused to sell their products if they will be used in executions			0
that 's led several state prison systems to compounding pharmacies , which are not as heavily regulated by the @entity115 as more conventional pharmacies			0

the pharmacy refused to sell the state any more drugs , citing threats it received after its name was made public			0
