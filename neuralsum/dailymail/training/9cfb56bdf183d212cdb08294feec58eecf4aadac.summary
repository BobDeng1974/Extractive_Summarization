mps voted to back a 1 per cent cap on annual rises in benefits last night as @entity4 was accused of wanting to spend taxpayers ’ money ‘ like drunks on a friday night ’			1
the opposition refused to support @entity9 moves to save billions from @entity11 ’s vast welfare bill , arguing that it was a ‘ @entity12 ’ on families			1
work and pensions secretary @entity14 claimed @entity4 had attempted to ‘ buy votes ’ by paying tax credits to nine in every ten families with children , making payments to those earning up to £ 70,000 a year			1
work and pensions secretary @entity14 challenged @entity4 in the @entity21 to explain how it would raise the £ 1.9billion cost of opposing the benefits cap there were heated exchanges in the @entity26 as mps clashed over plans to cap benefits rises at one per cent for the next three years ‘ they spent people ’s money like drunks on a friday night , ’ he told mps			1
‘ they are the party of “ spend more , borrow more , tax more and let the next generation pick up the bill ”			2
’ after the vote , prime minister @entity39 used @entity41 to declare the cap was ' fair ' and accused @entity4 of having the wrong priorities			2
the benefits now subject to a cap include : mr @entity14 said @entity4 ’s refusal to back the cap for the next three years , a move which will save more than £ 2billion a year , demonstrated it was a ‘ laughing stock ’ when it came to deficit reduction			1
a handful of @entity52 , including former leader @entity53 and ex-minister @entity54 , also failed to support the government in a vote after hours of acrimonious debate			2
but the legislation was carried in the @entity21 with a majority of 66			0
after the vote , the prime minister used @entity41 to declare the cap was ' fair ' and accused @entity4 of having the wrong priorities			0
business secretary @entity63 , meanwhile , made an outspoken attack on his @entity66 colleagues for ‘ completely unacceptable ’ language suggesting the government supported ‘ strivers ’ rather than ‘ shirkers ’			0
he said there had to be a ‘ tightening up ’ in the welfare budget , but added : ‘ i ’m certainly very uncomfortable with some of the language which has been used by our @entity74 partners attacking people who are out of work			0
’ @entity4 ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity78 , who also objected to the ‘ tone ’ adopted by @entity81 , faced acute embarrassment as it emerged that he had referred to ‘ shirkers ’ himself at least twice before			1
better off on benefits ? how each april the rise in state handouts has risen by more than the average annual increase in wages			1
for the next three years the government will cap rises at one per cent @entity4 's @entity91 ( left ) and @entity78 , claim the benefits bill could be cut by getting more people into work traditionally , benefits have been increased in line with the rate of inflation			1
that prompted uproar last year , when the formula meant their value increased by more than 5 per cent – at a time when many working families have had to contend with pay freezes or below - inflation rises			1
the @entity74 ’s @entity108 will peg benefit rises at 1 per cent a year for three years from next april			1
an impact assessment published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap , losing £ 5 a week			2
working households in receipt of state support in the form of tax credits will be an average of £ 3 a week worse off , though the @entity120 insists this will be more than cancelled out by a record increase in the basic rate income tax allowance which will come into effect in april			1
mr @entity14 said @entity4 had now opposed every single measure the @entity74 has introduced to reduce the welfare bill , which has increased from £ 132billion ten years ago to £ 192billion – a real terms increase of 45 per cent			2
@entity4 had rejected £ 83billion in welfare savings , equivalent to £ 5,000 in extra debt or tax rises for every working family			2
‘ they think that helping people is about trapping more and more people in benefits , ’ mr @entity14 said			0
‘ what a ridiculous nonsense they have created			0
’ mr @entity78 insisted seven million working households , as well as those out of work , will be hit by the @entity141			1
‘ this is a strivers ’ tax , pure and simple			0
it is going to hit people on tax credits and we oppose this strivers ’ tax , ’ he said			1
mr @entity78 said he welcomed those questioning ‘ the tone of this debate ’ , adding : ‘ we should not reduce it to a basic division between @entity11 ’s shirkers and strivers			0
’ but it later emerged that in 2011 , he had told the @entity4 conference : ‘ many people on the doorstep at the last election felt that too often we were for shirkers not workers			0
’ and last year , he told the @entity162 : ‘ we are the @entity4			0
the party that said that idleness is an evil			0
the party of workers , not shirkers			0
’ workers in the private sector are more than £ 1,000 a year worse off than they were before the financial crisis struck , according to figures published today			0
