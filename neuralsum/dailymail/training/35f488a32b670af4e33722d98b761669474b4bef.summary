by @entity0 @entity1 was first targeted by @entity3 producers as the setting for new a welfare scroungers documentary			0
now the @entity7 fishing town has been given the borat treatment - becoming the inspiration for @entity10 's new film about football hooligans and binge drinkers			1
the comedian , who rose to fame after playing fake rapper @entity15 , has started production for the new project which is set to be released in 2015			0
but the move has prompted criticism because locals believe the town 's name is being used in ' bad light ' and will have a negative impact on the local economy			1
the blockbuster is based in the @entity7 town and is about football hooligans the 42 - year old actor , who has also played the controversial roles of @entity59 and @entity60 , has been spotted around @entity45 with film crews			1
the @entity46 town has been transformed into @entity1 for filming , with road signs and restaurant names being changed and mock discount shops being set up to represent the @entity7 community in the 1980s			1

he said : ' it is using the town 's name in potentially a poor light			1
what also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town 's name			1
' anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative , but i hope people will be open - minded when they watch the film			2
he added that depicting @entity1 as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong			1
' my view is quite simple			0
we do n't have a massive issue with hooliganism			0
there is very good stewarding at the ground			0
in general we are not in the same category as other clubs like @entity117 who have a history of it			0

in 2012 , the @entity180 town of @entity181 officially changed its name to @entity181 in an attempt to boost its image after one of @entity10 's films			1
