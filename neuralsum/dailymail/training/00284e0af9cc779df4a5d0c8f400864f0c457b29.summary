by @entity0 as @entity6 fans obsess over what the @entity7 is expected to look like , the rumour mill about the firm 's next range of tablets is slowly gaining traction			1
according to reports from @entity12 , suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the next - generation @entity14 - dubbed @entity14 2 - later this month			1
it is expected to feature the @entity17 camera seen on the @entity18 , a faster processor and , most notably , it could sport @entity6 's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device			1
along with the improved security features promised on @entity24 , this could make the @entity14 2 the most secure tablet ever			1
the original @entity14 was launched on friday 1 november 2013 ( stock image shown )			2
given @entity6 's preference for launching products on a friday , a release date for the upgraded @entity14 2 of 31 october 2014 seems possible , with the company apparently gearing up for a release in @entity32 or @entity33 this year in addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner , @entity6 's @entity24 could also help boost the security of its next - generation devices			1
for example , when connecting to a @entity40 network , the software wo n't reveal your device 's @entity43 address			2
this is used to identify the device , and can be used to determine who owns it			0
@entity6 is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store			2
the tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers , or showing excessive advertising			0
according to @entity64 , production of the displays for the next - generation tablet has begun			0
this will gear it up for release in the autumn , expected to be a friday towards the end of october , bringing it in line with previous releases			2
the original @entity14 , for example , launched on friday 1 november 2013 - perhaps suggest 31 october 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release , given @entity6 ’s preference of launching products on a friday			1
the @entity77 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor , which sported a 9.7 - inch ( 24.6 centimetres ) retina lcd display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536			0
it could also have a similar thickness , of 0.3 inches ( 7.5mm ) and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz ( 470g )			0
it ’s thought the camera will be upgraded from the @entity90 version seen on the current @entity14 to the same @entity17 camera used on the @entity18			1
this could also include the isight technology that makes low - light shots easier to take , and allows for slow - motion video to be filmed			0
@entity96 - based @entity6 ( stock image shown ) is gearing up to release the latest version of its @entity14 later this year			1
rumours suggest the @entity77 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor			1
the overall size of the tablet , however , is likely to remain nearly the same @entity6 's @entity7 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity105 ' version that will make it the slimmest phone in the world			1
up until august last year , @entity108 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity112 , at 0.24 inches ( 6.18 millimetres )			0
this was then replaced by the @entity114 at just 0.23 inches ( 5.75 millimetres )			0
by comparison , @entity6 ’s current @entity18 has a depth of 0.3 inches ( 7.6 millimetres ) , while the @entity14 is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches ( 7.5 millimetres )			1
@entity118 's @entity117 is 0.3 inches ( 7.6 millimetres ) thick , while the @entity120 @entity119 is 0.37 inches ( 9.35 millimetres )			0
inside the device , the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the @entity125 , with among @entity126 reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous @entity128			1
and finally , it is almost certain the @entity77 will use the same @entity131 fingerprint sensor to unlock the device			2
this was introduced on the @entity18 and is expected to also be used on the @entity7 6			2
a new @entity134 is also expected to be released at the same time as @entity6 's other flagship models			1
' @entity6 sees its @entity131 fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security , and with @entity141 8 on the horizon , @entity6 is opening up that technology to app developers , ' @entity136 from @entity137 tells @entity145			1
' the @entity105 will not only be more secure , but it will also make it easier for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly			2
' it ’s unlikely that @entity6 will change its winning formula too much , though			0
@entity6 's @entity18 ( pictured ) was the first phone from the tech giant to use the new @entity131 fingerprint technology			1
this is able to recognise the fingerprint of the user and , when a digit is pressed against the home button at the bottom , it allows the phone to be unlocked without entering a code ' aside from the rumoured @entity131 scanner , improvements to the camera and faster processor , @entity6 is unlikely to make other changes to the hardware			1
' expect a very similar design to the first @entity14 , with a few upgrades and perhaps another colour option			0
' in other @entity6 news , yet more pictures of @entity6 's @entity7 were revealed yesterday showing the handset side - by - side with the current @entity7			1
the leak came from former @entity176 pop star @entity175 who also leaked the @entity177 and the @entity134 ahead of their releases			0
they appear to confirm the handset will has a larger 4.7 - inch screen , and that @entity6 has moved the power button to allow the handset to be operated easily with one hand			0
the @entity7 6 shown next to the current 5s			0
it has a 4.7 - inch ( 11.9 centimetres ) screen , it is claimed , and is likely to be announced in september the @entity7 ( left ) has the same fingerprint sensor as the @entity18 ( right ) , but is noticeably larger according to @entity175 , the @entity7 comes with a 4.7 - inch ( 11.9cm ) display , more rounded than the previous models			2
he described the device as being ' very grippy ' in the hand			0
the device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours @entity6 could abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector currently used for charging			2
the leaks are the latest to hit @entity6 , all showing an identical , slimline design			0
however , @entity6 has not commented on the pictures			0
former @entity176 pop star @entity175 who also leaked the @entity177 and the @entity134 ahead of their releases , shown with the @entity205 ( right )			0

next generation @entity14 will build on the *success* of @entity6 's @entity18
rumours suggest the @entity96 company will use fingerprint technology
@entity141 8 , which will run on devices , has improved a number of security tools
the @entity105 will also have an upgraded @entity17 camera
and an improved @entity125 processor will be 50 *%* faster than its predecessor
