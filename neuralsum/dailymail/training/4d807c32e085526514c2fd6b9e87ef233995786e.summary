by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 has confirmed @entity3 is not in the southern @entity5 search zone where pings were detected in early april			1
a statement from the @entity9 search team said on thursday : ' the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete			1
' and in its professional judgment , the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of @entity3			1
' the @entity16 said there was no evidence to suggest the four detected pings , which were used to base the search area , were from the plane 's black boxes			1
and no debris from @entity3 has been found during the extensive search			1
families of the passengers and crew on board the flight , including the @entity31 wife of passenger @entity32 , have been left shattered by the news			1
' it is just another slap in the face			0
it 's just another long road for us and look , i 'm just shattered by the news			2
i 'm absolutely shattered , ' @entity40 told @entity41 from her @entity43 home			0
' our best theory at this point is that ( the pings were ) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the @entity64 , ' mr @entity48 told @entity56			0
' always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out , that you could start producing sound			0
' those looking for the plane used the pinger locator to listen for underwater signals			0
the @entity3 flight and its 239 passengers disappeared on march 8 , while flying from @entity80 to @entity81			2
mr @entity48 said searchers would have discovered the black boxes if the pings had been coming from them			0
he also indicated other countries involved in the search had come to the same conclusion - that the pings found seven weeks ago were not from the flight 's data or cockpit voice recorders			1
the @entity92 - 21 , pictured here with able seaman @entity94 , was used to search the southern @entity5 for signs of the plane but he said he could not completely rule out that the noises came from the black boxes			1
the @entity9 announced on april 7 that a pinger locator towed from the @entity101 navy vessel @entity102 had picked up two acoustic signals , with one held for more than two hours			0
the signals were described as consistent with flight data or cockpit voice recorders and at the time became the most solid lead and likely from a man - made source			1
the man charged with finding the plane , @entity113 , said it was ' the most promising lead ' to date			2
two days later , two more signals were detected and held for about five and seven minutes			0
@entity117 ended its initial stage of the underwater search on wednesday , finishing its scan of large areas surrounding the four ping sites			2
the @entity92 - 21 mission came to an end after the underwater drone did not detect any aircraft debris from the time it began scanning the sea floor off the @entity101 coast on april 14			1
the drone scoured more than 850 square kilometres of ocean floor in its search for signs of the missing aircraft			0
the @entity92 - 21 , an underwater vehicle , was unable to look in the area where the most northern ping was located because of deep waters			2
@entity101 navy fleets , including the @entity141 ( pictured ) , have been assisting in the search , which will not ramp up again for at least two months while new equipment is moved to a new search area with the pings used to determine the search area almost ruled out , the @entity9 will now expand its search while also reviewing all existing radar , satellite and aircraft performance data			1
this will help define a search zone of up to 60,000 square kilometres in the southern @entity5 , which still follows an arc defined by @entity155 company @entity154 based on the final ' handshakes ' between the @entity157 and satellites			1
relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding @entity154 publicly release its data , after loosing faith that searchers were looking in the right area			0
@entity9 said the findings of the data review would be made public in due course			0
as well as sea floor mapping in the defined search area , more vessels will be added to the survey , expected to take about three months			1
a new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will follow in august , with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released , according to @entity9			2
' a single prime contractor will be chosen to bring together and manage the expertise , equipment and vessels to carry out the search , ' the centre said			2
@entity185 's @entity184 said it would take more time to move new equipment within the search area , which is about 60,000 square kilometres			1
squadron leader @entity188 of the @entity190 airforce was one of the officers who helped look for the plane after four pings were found on april 5 and 8 @entity40 , pictured with sons @entity194 , 13 months old and @entity196 , 3 , is struggling with news searchers have given up on the area where pings were detected the @entity31 wife of a passenger on ill - fated @entity3 said she is having trouble coming to terms with news that searchers have given up on an area of the @entity5 where acoustic pings were detected			1
@entity209 ' husband @entity208 , a mechanical engineer , boarded @entity3 on his way to start a new job in @entity212			2
mrs @entity40 lives is in @entity43 , where the family moved after the @entity215 earthquakes in 2011			0
' when your child cries for their father , it just breaks your heart and i ca n't tell them the truth because i do n't know , ' she told the @entity225			0
' i still have n't reconciled that he 's not coming back , because i 've had nothing			0
' when you do n't have anything - not even a piece of the plane , just nothing , and so many different stories - how can you not have a little piece of hope ? ' ' it is just another slap in the face			2
it 's just another long road for us and look , i 'm just shattered by the news			2
i 'm absolutely shattered , ' she told @entity41			0
the couple have two boys , @entity196 , 3 , and 13 - month - old @entity194			0
transport minister @entity244 has told federal parliament the search is moving into a new phase and @entity117 was committed to doing everything it can to find the plane			0
' we are still very confident that the resting place of the aircraft is in the @entity254 , ' he said			0
' unfortunately this is a painstaking effort in a very large ocean			0
' mr @entity244 said the next search area could be 800 kilometres long and 70km wide			1
manager of opposition business @entity259 said families of the those on the missing plane had been left hanging after the most recent search failed to the plane			1
' once again we offer our condolences and words of comfort to the families and friends of the passengers on @entity3 who still await more news , ' he said .			1

@entity2 confirms @entity3 is not in the @entity5 search zone where pings were detected in early april
no debris has been found in the search area , which has been ruled out
families have been left shattered by the news
authorities from all countries involved agree pings were n't from the plane
instead they are believed to have come from another man - made object
this *announcement* comes as the first stage of the search wound up
it will be at least two months before it starts again as equipment is moved
