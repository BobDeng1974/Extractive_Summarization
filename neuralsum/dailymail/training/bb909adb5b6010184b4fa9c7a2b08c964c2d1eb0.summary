it is easy to understand why @entity2 's coaches felt @entity3 could cope with an in - at - the - deep - end return to @entity6 rugby			1
the @entity8 prop is a master of understatement , which perfectly illustrates his unflappable nature			2
one stock response sums up the tighthead 's measured outlook			2
asked about the prospect of starting against @entity17 in @entity18 , after a year out of the international game due to injury , he calmly conceded : ' it 's not ideal			1
' asked to reflect on @entity2 's capitulation at the @entity23 two years ago , he said : ' it was n't ideal ' - different tense , same sentiment			1
@entity3 will earn his 49th @entity6 cap when they take on @entity17 in the @entity29 opener on friday @entity30 ( centre ) has been ruled out of friday 's clash against @entity17 due to a neck injury @entity2 have won 62.2 per cent games with @entity3 in their line - up compared to 58.3 per cent without @entity3 , 27 , has been thrown straight back into @entity2 's starting front row , after six weeks out with a foot injury - following nine months on the sidelines with a serious neck problem - because @entity40 's @entity30 has been ruled out			1
@entity30 also has neck damage , leaving the @entity42 for whom he often deputised to fill the void at short notice			2
when @entity3 made his autumn comeback for the @entity8 after surgery , he later admitted that he was not so much worried about his neck as the uncomfortable prospect that he might be ' rubbish ' after so long out of the game			1
he need not have worried about that and he will not be concerned about what awaits on friday night - a 49th @entity6 cap and a head - to - head scrum collision with the wily @entity56 loosehead , @entity57			1
@entity3 's lack of game time is alleviated by an abundance of experience			1
' confident ? i would n't be here if i was n't , ' he said			2
' yes , it 's not the most ideal entrance to the test scene , but i got the nine months ( absence ) out of the system with the eight games i played for @entity8			0
we had @entity73 back - to - back and the @entity72 , so they were hardly easy games			2
' you believe in the conditioning and it 's not like i 've done nothing over the past few weeks			0
i feel as best prepared as i can be			0
it 's about getting the sharpness back			0
it 's not like you are starting at square one when you come back in			0
' @entity3 ( right ) has endured an injury - plagued 12 months for @entity2 and club side @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity3 ( left ) is helped by fellow forward @entity83 during @entity2 's training session on monday @entity2 forwards coach @entity85 insisted that there is minimal risk involved in asking @entity3 to resume his starting role without a suitable build - up			1
' @entity3 is a class , proven operator , ' he said			1
' he 's not been out for six months and he 's not been twiddling his thumbs for the last six weeks			0
we have trained pretty fast and he 's slotted in nicely			0
his knowledge does n't dissipate over six weeks			0
dealing with environments like friday night comes with experience			1
it 's good to have him around			0
' when he turns his focus on to the grim ordeal @entity2 endured at the @entity23 in 2013 , @entity3 's recollections of the game and the occasion are typically moderate			1
' it was n't ideal , ' he said			0
' you remember the day - it was n't really a high point			2
you are playing in front of 80,000 people and it 's loud			0
it was probably a step up from what i have played in front of at the @entity23 before			2
' the @entity56 did live off that atmosphere but i would n't say it threw us off our game			0
both teams feed off the crowd because it provides energy			0
' the interruption to his career caused by a rare injury allowed @entity3 to take a long - overdue rest and he has returned fresh and ' a touch heavier ' , which wo n't be a prospect to encourage @entity57			1
' i 'm in better nick than i was before , ' said the man charged with anchoring @entity2 's set - piece assault			1
if he says that , it must be true , because even mild hyperbole is not his style			0
@entity3 was part of the @entity2 side that were thrashed 30 - 3 in their last @entity29 visit to @entity17 in 2013			1

@entity17 host @entity2 in the @entity29 opener on friday night
@entity2 were thrashed 30 - 3 in their last visit to @entity17 two years ago
@entity3 will earn his 49th @entity142 in the @entity23 encounter
