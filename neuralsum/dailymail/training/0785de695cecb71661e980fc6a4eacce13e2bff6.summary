' we already teach three languages at this school , it 's historically an area of @entity51 and @entity52 descent so we teach those and also aboriginal language @entity54			0

' in the early years of primary school , i envisage that lessons might be conducted in @entity110 on three or four days per week , before the balance is adjusted as the students grow in confidence in both languages			1
' i understand that @entity44 - speaking students need to engage in around 2,800 hours of intense , focused study to become proficient in @entity110 - this is only possible in an immersion environment			1

' i would like to see more of these kinds of schools throughout @entity7 , the @entity180 has done this with @entity44 for many years			1
' @entity26 is very important in @entity7 , it is the second language in @entity186 and so it 's an important community language			1
' anyone at a bilingual school would be at a distinct advantage because they would have had more time to learn the language so by the time they come to the jobs market they should know the language			1
