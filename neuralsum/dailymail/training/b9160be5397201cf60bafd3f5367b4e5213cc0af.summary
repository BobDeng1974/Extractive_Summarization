' @entity5 and @entity70 did n't have action figures for their movie @entity73 because they know the jewish community would never allow it , and the @entity68 - @entity68 community should n't allow anyone to disrespect our ancestors			1
' mr @entity51 organized a major protest and rally outside the @entity81 ceremony to draw attention to ' the injustice and disrespect to our @entity68 ancestors			0

in the company 's defence , the figurines are said to be intended not as toys but as collectibles for adults rather than children			2
but reviewers on @entity18 , where the dolls are no longer available to buy , have other ideas			1
one wrote : ' why ? really this is some racist s * * * ! the movie was good , but this is inexcusable			2
do the accessories include whips , chains and klan members ? ' another said : ' i am in complete shock that someone would exploit the struggle of my ancestors and the entire freedom movement with such tasteless , classless , and disgusting " action figures "			0
' shame on @entity18 for even selling these			1

' i would never do that when it comes to my characters			0
' the director also said that slavery continues in the @entity13 - it has just taken on a different form			0
