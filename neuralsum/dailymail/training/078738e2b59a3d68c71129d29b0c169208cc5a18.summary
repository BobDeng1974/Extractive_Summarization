it 's 7.50pm , and you 're walking out of the tunnel at the @entity4 to the welcome of a 7,987 - strong attendance			0
to your left is @entity8 – a man who earns £ 280,000 per week , or £ 40,000 a day , while you earn pennies by comparison			1
@entity11 were in that very situation a little over a week ago , when a @entity13 – total cost , £ 276million – drew 0 - 0 with their @entity16 counterparts – total cost , zilch			1
@entity8 walks out for @entity13 in their @entity20 tie with @entity21 at the @entity4 as in so many matches this season , @entity8 was ineffective as @entity11 were held 0 - 0 by the @entity16 side signed on : september 1 wages per week : £ 280,000 wages per day : £ 40,000 goals in all competitions : 3 pay per goal as of january 29 : £ 2million yet forget that @entity20 hiccup because this week marks an anniversary , and sometimes that calls for celebration			1
@entity32 can only have been tempted to use the good @entity33 on thursday , when his client , @entity8 , passed 150 days at @entity35			1
the milestone for the man with three @entity39 goals marks the day his wages hit a cool £ 6m since moving to @entity41 from @entity42			1
it was on august 31 when @entity8 was photographed peeking out of the window of a private jet			2
no stop off in @entity47 or @entity48 , despite apparent interest from @entity50 and @entity51			0
the moment @entity8 touched down in a private jet to sign for @entity13 on deadline day last summer @entity54 got him			1
a club desperate to become @entity57 heavyweights once more added the world - renowned striker named after @entity60 – the @entity61 that starred for the greatest side not to win the 1982 @entity63			2
in a £ 6m season - long swoop plus wages they nabbed the natural - born killer from 12 yards or less , coached in the art of terrorising defenders by one himself : his father , @entity70			1
it was @entity8 's father who arranged his first contract – £ 50 per week – before his debut on august 28 , 1999 , in the @entity77 second division for @entity78 at the age of 13 years , 199 days			1
fast forward 15 years and it was @entity32 , the most powerful agent in football , who orchestrated his latest contract – leaving behind a club that average less than 15,000 fans at @entity85 @entity8 poses with the @entity42 no 9 shirt after joining the @entity88 side from @entity47 in 2013 @entity8 score 13 goals in 22 appearances for @entity42 over two injury - affected seasons how @entity8 scored his last goal against @entity93 yet his move from @entity42 to @entity41 has not matched expectations			1
not by a long shot			0
not enough to warrant the @entity98 family spending £ 2m per goal , nor enough to feel obligated to relinquish £ 43m to make his loan arrangement permanent			2
@entity8 has not scored or provided an assist since @entity103 against @entity93			1
between then and now , he 's faced @entity104 ( 60 minutes ) , @entity105 ( 90 ) and @entity21 ( 90 )			1
against @entity105 , to his credit , @entity8 's positioning was second to none			1
yet every chance – the point - blank header from five yards out , for example – was squandered			0
one miss in particular was ridiculed , mainly because it was captured from an unkind angle where you could not see @entity116 get his studs to it beforehand			0
@entity119 reacted to the air shot appropriately : ' even @entity121 ... ' you can guess the rest			0
@entity13 created more chances ( 16 ) against @entity105 than any other team this year			1
the closest after that being against @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 ( all 15 )			0
had it not been for @entity131 , @entity8 would have his fourth , perhaps fifth or even sixth goal in all competitions			2
the pesky @entity105 goalkeeper was seemingly hell - bent on not allowing him relief			1
@entity8 fails to make contact with the ball as he passes up a sitter of a chance in @entity11 's match with @entity105 the missed chance at @entity142 has been one of a number of moments of disappointment this season @entity8 's heat map from @entity11 's 2 - 0 win at @entity105 a fortnight ago and so to @entity21 , where @entity8 managed 24 touches and one shot on target against a team loitering some 76 places below them in the @entity155 basement			1
the appropriately - named @entity156 , meanwhile , is rubbing his hands			2
his club are prepared for a £ 1.7m windfall in their return trip to @entity35 on february 3 , a smidgen more than their annual income of £ 1.6m			1
bang for the buck , indeed			0
all this frustrates @entity32 , who accordingly stuck his nose in			2
the not - so - average mr @entity167 took aim at his client 's new manager , insisting @entity8 would be better off under the guidance of @entity13 's previous leader			2
' i would have liked it if @entity8 was with sir @entity177 , ' he told @entity178 last week			2
' he is a player who needs to play 90 minutes and i do n't understand [ why he is n't ]			1
' @entity8 pictured with his agent @entity32 , who has leapt to his defence in recent weeks minutes : 90 goals : 0 assists : 0 shots : 3 shots on target : 3 @entity186 passes : 33 @entity187 passes : 22 ( 66.7 % ) duels : 17 duel success : 58.8 % offsides : 1 minutes : 90 goals : 0 assists : 0 shots : 3 shots on target : 1 @entity186 passes : 18 @entity187 passes : 18 ( 100 % ) duels : 9 duel success : 33.3 % offsides : 1 be careful what you wish for , @entity32			1
@entity8 's 90 minutes apiece against @entity105 and @entity21 saw six shots , four on target , 40 accurate passes , two offside calls , no goals and no assists			1
all this , shown above			0
this does n't fit the reputation of a man voted for by @entity211 to win the 2013 @entity212			0
no petty , political , @entity215 voting by the @entity216 that year , it seems			0
is it a lack of service ? an injury hangover ? @entity54 's formation ? plain , old rotten luck ? well , against @entity105 , @entity8 ( no 9 ) played a supporting role behind @entity224 ( no 7 ) , as the average positions below demonstrate			1
against @entity21 , he averaged a role further up the pitch , more central , slightly ahead of @entity229			2
next up , @entity230 , the club bottom of the @entity39 , and minnows @entity21 – both at @entity35			1
score against them , and what were we worried about ? fail , and uh oh			0
@entity8 ( no 9 ) among @entity13 's average positions against @entity105 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) when @entity8 signed in the early hours of september 1 , the headlines wrote themselves			1
take , for example , @entity239 's ' striking it rich ' , @entity241 's ' £ 350,000 a week ' , or @entity242 's ' wow @entity8 '			1
that buzz , however , has left			0
the hype , barely existent			0
this was always a gamble			0
they hired a man that suffered anterior cruciate damage in january – an injury which stole the @entity252 and eight months from him			0
it was the third severe knee injury of his career			2
@entity8 , still to this day , is understood to ice the delicate area following every training session			2
a rumour strengthened when he uploaded a photo to @entity259 , inadvertently showing what looked to be an ice pack strapped to his left knee			0
there are still concerns about @entity8 's knee , which caused him to miss the @entity63 last year @entity11 must make a decision on whether or not to sign the @entity77 striker on a permanent basis not so reassuring , either , is @entity8 's diminishing records at @entity13 when compared to @entity42 and @entity47			1
his shot conversion rate ( 15 per cent ) is the 64th best in the @entity39			0
it is by far his lowest at every club he 's been with since 2011 , as the table below shows			0
his average shots per game ( 1.5 ) is down , a far cry from his record with @entity47 in 2011/12 ( 3.2 ) and 2012/13 ( 2.9 )			0
yet not all is lost			0
his shooting accuracy ( 70 per cent ) is better than ever , and he now has as many assists ( 3 ) as he has managed in any season since 2011			0
@entity8 greets @entity284 at the @entity212 awards ceremony in @entity286 back in 2012 perhaps this is a storm in a teacup , then			0
maybe his so - called ' adjustment period ' is just longer than others			0
but @entity54 is losing patience , no matter what he says			0
dropping a man being paid £ 280,000 per week against @entity294 – your @entity296 qualification rivals – hardly screams faith			1
a goal against @entity230 or @entity21 would be a start because , so far , there 's no value for money to be had here			0
and if it persists , @entity13 would be better washing their hands of @entity8 .			2

@entity8 has scored just three goals since arriving at @entity35
the striker earns £ 280,000 per week on his season - long loan from @entity42
his agent , @entity32 , said last week about @entity8 : ' he is a player who needs to play 90 minutes and i do n't understand [ why he is n't ] '
@entity8 played 90 minutes against @entity105 and @entity21 but could n't score
the 28 - year - old has struggled with injury throughout his career
@entity54 must wash his hands of @entity8 if he form does not improve
