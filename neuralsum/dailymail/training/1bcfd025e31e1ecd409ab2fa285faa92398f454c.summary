today 's teenagers are less likely to drink , smoke and take drugs than their predecessors making them the most sensible generation for a decade , according to statistics			1
@entity7 figures also show that the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped dramatically over a 40 - year period - with abortions in recent years also showing a decline			1
government officials have claimed the downward trend could be explained by a changing demographic , as there are far more young @entity16 in the @entity17 today , who do not drink , smoke or have sex			1
some believe the behaviour shift is party a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through @entity27 and @entity28 than they do in person ( picture posed by models ) table shows a dramatic decline in teenagers drinking , smoking and taking drugs as well as a significant fall in girls under 18 becoming pregnant and having abortions others believe the behaviour shift is partly a result of social media - as many teenagers spend more time interacting online through @entity27 and @entity28 than they do in person			1
this leaves less time for young people to experiment with alcohol , smoking , drugs and sex			1
speaking to the @entity51 , @entity52 , a specialist in young people 's behaviour and health at @entity56 , said : ' more socialising can now happen at a distance			2
' you can do social things that do n't involve going out in the park drinking or trying to get into the pub. ' teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest since the 1970s			0
figures from the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) show that the number of pregnancies in women under the age of 18 plummeted from 45,000 in 1969 to just over 30,000 in 2011			2
from 2012 to 2013 abortion rates for under 18s fell from 12.8 per 1,000 girls in 2012 to 11.7 in 2013			0
over the same period , the abortion rates for girls under the age of 16 , dropped from three in every 1,000 to 2.6			0
@entity76 , director of the @entity77 at @entity78 , believes that today 's young people are not abstaining from sex , but that more are using contraception			1
she said ' levels of sexual activity seem to be pretty consistent			0
there was a lot of work by the previous government on young people 's health			1
' we should welcome the fact that if you give young people the right kind of support they will look after themselves			0
' @entity77 say progress made reducing teenage pregnancies will also have a positive impact on child poverty and infant mortality rates - which they say disproportionately affect children of teenage parents			0
@entity7 statistics also highlight a steep decline in teenagers who describe themselves as regular smokers with a 2003 figure of 9 per cent falling to 3 per cent last year			0
similarly , figures over the same ten - year period show that the proportion of teenage school pupils who had tried drugs fell from 30 percent to 16 per cent			2
@entity115 , the public health minister , commented : ' trends in the drinking , smoking and teenage pregnancy rates for young people are very encouraging			2
' figures show pregnancy in under - 18s is at its lowest rate for 40 years and the numbers of young people drinking and smoking are also falling			1
' we know that we ca n't be complacent though			0
young people who adopt healthy lifestyles early on can use them as a building block for success , using that resilience to get on in life			0

government figures show teenage pregnancies fallen by a third since 1969
in the last decade , number of teenage pupils trying drugs has *halved*
while number of teens calling themselves regular smokers is down a third
it 's believed social media plays a part as young people spend *longer* *indoors*
@entity153 say shift could also be explained by change in demographic with more young @entity16 in @entity17 today who do n't drink , smoke or have sex
