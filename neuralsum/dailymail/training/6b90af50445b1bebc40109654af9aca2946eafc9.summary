on the field at least , this crushing @entity1 victory represented a new low for @entity4 and proof that the problems besetting this football team run a lot deeper than the identity of the manager			1
any hope that the placing of @entity13 on gardening leave might provoke a positive reaction was dissolved within 12 barnstorming minutes as @entity1 grabbed control of the contest and rendered it an early walkover with strikes from @entity21 and @entity22			1
this was @entity4 ’ heaviest domestic defeat since losing 6 - 2 in an @entity26 in 2000 , a day on which a certain @entity25 helped man the @entity29 defence			2
@entity25 the manager spoke afterwards of @entity1 ’ near - perfect performance and , in @entity32 , he possessed the game ’s classiest performer			1
@entity1 's @entity21 strikes the ball to put the home side 1 - 0 up against @entity4 early on in the match players watch on as @entity21 's shot flies into the top left - hand corner of the net after just eight minutes @entity1 : @entity42 , @entity21 ( @entity43 74 ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity32 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 87 ) , @entity22 ( @entity51 87 ) , @entity52 subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 goals : @entity21 8 , @entity22 12 , @entity47 63 , @entity48 70 @entity4 : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 46 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 34 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity72 83 ) subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 booked : black 21 , @entity62 86 @entity78 acted as assistant throughout @entity13 ’s time in charge , but this was not so much a bruising introduction to the front line as a full - on torture session			1
the caretaker manager looked shell - shocked as @entity4 were taken apart by a side which started the day seven points poorer off in the @entity90 standings			1
the irony is that nobody gained from this result so much as the league leaders , and @entity96 ’ procession to automatic promotion moved a step closer as @entity4 fell further behind in the title race			0
even victory in next weekend ’s @entity103 derby is highly unlikely to provide @entity25 ’ side with the opening to haul themselves back into the hunt but , having now chalked up three victories on the bounce , there is momentum at @entity111			0
and , having now beaten @entity4 twice in the league handsomely , there is no reason for them to fear a play - off against the @entity117 club at the end of the season			2
@entity111 has arguably proved @entity1 ’ biggest obstacle to keeping pace with neighbours @entity96 at the top of the table			0
still resentful of being relegated alongside the neighbours last term , the @entity125 crowd have been a cranky lot this season , affording little patience to @entity25 ’ new - look side as they have bedded in			0
@entity22 was in the right place at the right time to slot home @entity1 ' second of the afternoon @entity22 celebrates with his team - mates after putting @entity1 2 - 0 up against @entity4 at @entity111 with @entity1 entertaining @entity4 for the first time since the latter ’s financial meltdown in 2012 , this was a top - tier standard occasion and the audience reflected the fact by backing their players to the hilt			1
the ground was not full but it was noisy and @entity21 ’s rocket soon boosted the decibel levels			0
although @entity4 had not been here on league duty since a @entity153 double gave them a comfortable win in december 2011 , they had visited the stadium for last term ’s @entity156 , which ended in a humiliating defeat by @entity159			2
this was a different class of opposition but the shame was no less for it			0
the @entity1 fans had already been warmed up by the sight of former @entity96 midfielder @entity66 being bullied off the ball by @entity32 when @entity21 unleashed his piledriver			1
a @entity48 cross had been half - cleared by @entity62 and @entity21 had time to take a touch as he stepped on to it 20 yards out			1
the resulting shot was straight and true , arrowing high past @entity59 at a fair pelt			0
@entity4 ' @entity66 ( centre ) looks very disappointed as he is substituted after just 34 minutes of the game @entity68 ( second left ) challenges @entity1 ' @entity47 , scorer of the home side 's third goal if that goal could just about be forgiven , @entity4 ’ defence was utterly incompetent at the second			1
not only did @entity48 have the time and space to meet @entity184 ’s looping cross unopposed , his ball back across goal found @entity22 in even more room in the six - yard box where he applied the simplest of finishes			1
@entity22 scored twice at @entity191 earlier in the season and he was again proving a constant menace , pulling @entity4 ’ defenders all over the place and showing no lack of confidence with the ball at his feet			1
he attempted one of his zingers from 20 yards , forcing @entity59 to spill and , after @entity47 sent the rebound wide , @entity66 ’s embarrassment was completed as the no 8 was shown on the board to signal his withdrawal			0
already on a booking after a brainless challenge on @entity32 , the midfielder was saved from himself , if not the baying crowd , by @entity78 , with @entity67 being sent on in his place			0
there were just 33 minutes on the clock			0
@entity44 ( right ) makes a challenge on @entity4 ' @entity70 during the @entity90 match @entity4 ' @entity69 ( centre ) tries to break past the challenge of @entity219 ( left ) a cry of ‘ sack the board ’ went up from the away end and there was even some rare self - deprecation as they started to sarcastically cheer a succession of passes from the men in blue			1
the break robbed @entity1 of some momentum but they stood firm defensively with @entity45 and @entity21 both putting their heads in the way of @entity68 shots			2
@entity65 had come on for @entity4 at the break but the burly striker never looked like threatening			0
instead , @entity1 were able to pick their guests off			0
@entity47 got the third , swapping passes with @entity32 before sliding a low finish across @entity59 , and then @entity48 helped himself to the fourth			2
it was again @entity32 with the assist , first bamboozling @entity67 with a shimmy before driving forward and then scooping a pass into the path of @entity48 who , from a similar angle to @entity47 , applied a subtle volleyed finish into the far corner .			2

before the game , @entity4 were second in the @entity90 , seven points clear of third - place @entity1
@entity1 have now closed the gap to three points after thrashing @entity4
@entity21 opened the scoring , before @entity22 doubled the lead
@entity47 scored the third , before @entity48 completed the win
@entity78 was taking charge of @entity4 for the first time
