' for me to kind of know that i got sick , and then was so fortunate to receive the kind of care that i got , when so many people have nothing even approximating slightly that kind of care , it 's a heavy feeling			0
' the 33 - year - old , who was deemed a ' tulku ' — or reincarnated @entity100 lama — as an infant clarified that ' guilt ' is not the ' right word			2

but i can feel my strength coming back every day , ' he said			1

however , @entity8 wo n't admit to any regrets			1
' it 's not something that i will look back on and say , you know , it was the wrong decision to do , ' he told @entity1			1
' but it 's also important to keep yourself safe			0
