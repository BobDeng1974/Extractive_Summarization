by @entity0 stunned : @entity1 , 60 , was attended to by paramedics after suffering agonising pain in his leg writhing in agony in the back of an ambulance , all @entity1 could think about was getting to hospital as quickly as possible			1
but it seems his driver had other ideas			2
to the 60 - year - old patient ’s amazement , the speeding ambulance stopped on a dual carriageway ... to pick up two early morning hitchhikers			1
the door then opened and a woman in a short skirt who ‘ looked a bit worse for wear ’ climbed into the back with mr @entity1 while her male friend got into the front			1
the driver gave the couple a lift to the next town before taking mr @entity1 on to hospital in @entity30			1
the retired carpenter – who was suffering with deep - vein thrombosis – was then told by doctors he might have to have his right leg amputated			1
but after being transferred to another specialist hospital unit , medics managed to restore his blood flow with injections			2
the grandfather is now recovering at home in @entity41 , @entity42 , from an operation to repair his blocked artery and has complained to the @entity45 about the alleged incident on april 6			2
his ordeal began when his leg started swelling up and his doctor , who had made a late house call , phoned for an ambulance at 12.15am			1
two paramedics arrived around 45 minutes later and helped mr @entity1 into a seat in the back of the vehicle			1
they set off along the @entity57 dual carriageway towards @entity30 , driving at speed but without their blue emergency lights flashing			0
home : the medics helped the grandfather into an ambulance outside his home ( pictured ) in @entity66 , @entity42			1
but just minutes after setting off , the vehicle reportedly pulled over - and a male and female hitchhiker got in retired carpenter : shockingly , the woman then started asking mr @entity1 questions about his condition mr @entity1 , who has three grown - up sons with his wife @entity75 , said : ‘ i was in terrible pain			1
‘ we were going at quite a speed when the ambulance came to an abrupt stop			2
‘ all of a sudden the door slid open and there was a girl standing there in the roadside			0
she looked a bit worse for wear and bedraggled			0
‘ she was just wearing a skirt and a blouse despite the fact it was foggy and raining			0
‘ then a man got in the front seat			2
they looked like they ’d had a few beers and missed their lift back home			0
‘ the woman started asking me all sorts of questions – who i was , what was wrong with me			1
‘ i said , “ how the hell do i know , i have n’t been to hospital yet ”			0
i could n’t believe what was going on			0
the paramedic in the back with me looked as confused as i was			0
’ destination : mr @entity1 said the ambulance 's route to @entity112 ( above ) was further delayed after the driver stopped to drop off the hitchhikers at a garage			1
he is now recovering at home mr @entity1 says the ambulance carried on driving before it reached @entity118 and pulled over again , where the two hitchhikers jumped out at a garage			1
the vehicle then continued on to @entity123			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it was a race against time to save me and my leg and yet the driver was messing around giving people lifts – it ’s just not on			1
‘ if he was worried about these people he could have called the police			0
‘ the girl did n’t even say goodbye or thanks when she got out			0
there are a lot of valuable drugs in the back of an ambulance and for all he knew these two could have been armed with a knife or something			2
i would n’t want anyone to lose their jobs over this but it can not be allowed to happen again			0
’ it is believed the ambulance may have stopped because the crew thought the couple had been in a road traffic accident , or may have been at risk because of the bad weather			2
however an ambulance service spokesman said details would not be disclosed until the investigation was completed			0
the spokesman added : ‘ @entity158 takes all complaints seriously and has started an investigation to establish exactly what happened			0
