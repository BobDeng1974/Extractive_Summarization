he confirmed he has donated £ 1,000 to each of the 106 candidates former @entity2 adviser @entity21 said the money involved was not enough to be worth the potential controversy			1
‘ who exactly is meant to benefit from this ? ’ he said			0
‘ one hundred and six cash - strapped candidates , i suppose			0
but even though every little helps , £ 1000 is n’t going to go all that far			0
' and each of those candidates is about to spend every hour between now and polling day being chased around by angry people in ill - fitting multi-coloured jumpers who will shout : “ did you take @entity5 ’s blood money ? ” ’ @entity34 sources last night confirmed they expect some candidates to make an issue of the @entity5 donation on local leaflets			1
the defence minister @entity39 yesterday sent a message to her @entity2 opponent in the marginal seat of @entity43 , @entity44 , saying simply : ‘ @entity5 money , yes or no ? ’ defence minister @entity39 ( pictured left ) questioned her @entity2 opponent in the marginal seat of @entity43 about the money ; @entity50 deputy leader @entity49 said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that five @entity2 candidates in @entity53 were taking ' bad money ' from mr @entity5 her opponent , the former @entity2 mp @entity55 , a recipient of the cash , did not give an answer			1
@entity50 deputy leader @entity49 said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that five @entity2 candidates in @entity53 were taking ‘ bad money ’ from mr @entity5			2
he added : ‘ the fact that @entity2 candidates are happy to accept donations from the man who led us into the illegal war in @entity66 , introduced tuition fees and started the process of @entity70 privatisation is extraordinary			2

’ @entity72 , the @entity73 member of the @entity74 for @entity75 , challenged @entity74 candidates to hand the money back			0
he added : ‘ the former prime minister since leaving office has amassed a multi-million pound fortune by doing the bidding of the global banks that created the longest lasting recession since records began with their rotten behaviour			0
' he has worked for multinational energy companies who have rigged the energy market created by his @entity89 resulting in inflated energy costs for consumers , and global dictators guilty of human rights abuses			0
mr @entity5 , who has a strained relationship with @entity95 , said he was giving the money directly to @entity2 candidates in marginal seats because ‘ this is where the election will be won for @entity100 ' ' it is deeply disturbing that this blood money will now be used by the @entity100 in @entity103			1
’ mr @entity5 , who has a strained relationship with @entity95 , said he was giving the money directly to @entity2 candidates in marginal seats because ‘ this is where the election will be won for @entity100			1
’ the donation represents a relatively modest gesture from mr @entity5 , whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £ 100 million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high - profile property deals			2
his intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is now keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his own creation , @entity2			0
although he has said he has no desire to return to front line politics in the @entity125 , friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him			0
mr @entity5 is known to have backed mr @entity95 ’s elder brother @entity130 for the @entity2 leadership in 2010			0
