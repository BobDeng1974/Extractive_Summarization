physicists say they are now confident they have discovered a long - sought subatomic particle known as a @entity2			1
the @entity3 , or @entity3 , says a look at all the data from 2012 shows that what they found last year was a version of what is popularly referred to as the ' @entity10 particle '			1
@entity3 physicist @entity11 said today that ' it is clear that we are dealing with a @entity2 though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of @entity17 boson it is			1
' @entity3 , the world 's largest particle physics laboratory in @entity20 , @entity21 , where experts today confrimed they had found the @entity2 or ' god particle ' the long - theorized subatomic particle would explain why matter has mass. it is considered a missing cornerstone of physics			1
last july scientists with the world 's largest atom - smasher announced finding a particle they described as @entity17 - like			1
earlier this week researchers ruled out the finding being a ' super higgs ' that some cosmologists had hoped might open up more exotic secrets of the universe			2
' it does look like the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) @entity2 , ' said physicist @entity41 of @entity42 , one of two research teams working in parallel on the @entity17 project at @entity3 in @entity21			1
his assertion , on a slide presentation to a conference at @entity3 and posted on the @entity49 , was echoed by the other group			1
' so far , it is looking like an @entity52 , ' said slides from @entity54 of @entity55			2
the two groups work separately and without comparing findings to ensure their conclusions are reached independently			0
it has been assumed since the triumphant announcement last june that a new particle spotted at @entity64 's @entity63 ( @entity63 ) was the @entity17 , named after @entity65 theoretical physicist @entity17 , that , theories say , gave mass to matter after the @entity68 13.7 billion years ago			1
one of the proton - proton collisions measured in the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) experience in the search for the @entity2 a confirmed discovery of the @entity2 , which could happen this year , would likely win a @entity74 prize			0
meeting at @entity3 , near @entity20 , the scientists said on wednesday that the particle looked very much like it fit into the 30 - year - old @entity40 of the makeup of the universe			1
the existence of the @entity2 was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the @entity68 , an invisible force known as the @entity2 formed			0
this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or @entity17 bosons			1
as other particles pass through it , they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the @entity2 will be long term , but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine , computing and manufacturing			0
experts compare the search for the @entity2 to the discovery of the electron			0
the idea of the electron – a subatomic particle – was first floated in 1838 , but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years			2
a century on , the electron ’s existence underpins modern science			0
our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patient if confirmed , it would mean @entity63 scientists will have to wait until late in this decade for any sign of ' new worlds of physics '			0
until the last few days there had been some faint signs that the discovery might prove to be something more than the particle that would fill the last gap in the @entity40 , a comprehensive explanation of the basic composition of the universe			0
rumours flew of a ' super-higgs ' that might - as recently predicted by @entity143 physicist @entity142 in a book on the particle - ' be the link between our world and most of the matter in the universe			2
' @entity65 physicist @entity17 , who developed the theory of the @entity2 which is believed to confer mass. many scientists and cosmologists will be disappointed that the @entity63 's preliminary 3 - year run from march 2010 to last month has not produced evidence of the two grails of ' new physics ' - dark matter and supersymmetry			1
dark matter is the mysterious substance that makes up some 25 percent of the stuff of the universe , against the tiny 4 percent - galaxies , stars and planets - which is visible			2
the remainder is a still unexplained ' dark energy			0
' the theory of supersymmetry predicts that all elementary particles have heavier counterparts , also yet to be seen			0
it links in with more exotica like string theory , extra dimensions , and even parallel universes			0
' i think everyone had hoped for something that would take us beyond the @entity40 , but that was probably not realistic at this stage , ' said one researcher , who asked not to be named			0
the @entity63 closed down last month for two years of work that will double its power , and , it is hoped , the reach of its detectors .			2

@entity190 comes after three years of data from the @entity3 *supercollider*
researchers *previously* stopped short of claiming the boson , believed to give matter to mass , had been definitely discovered
team still *unsure* what type of @entity17 boson they have discovered
