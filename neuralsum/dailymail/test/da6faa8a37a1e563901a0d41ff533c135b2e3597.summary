@entity1 's love of the @entity2 continues to show no bounds as the reigning @entity6 champion again claimed pole position for the race			1
@entity1 now has a record five poles to his name at the track , and three in succession , to take his tally to 41 overall in his career			2
the 30 - year - old @entity15 ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his @entity17 team - mate @entity16 to give the team another front - row lock out			1
@entity21 's @entity20 , a surprise winner last time out in @entity24 , will start third , albeit down by nine tenths of a second on @entity27			1
now click here to read the full qualifying report			0
host commentator thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of sunday ’s race			0
1 @entity1 ; 2 @entity16 ; 3 @entity20 ; 4 @entity35 ; 5 @entity36 ; 6 @entity37 ; 7 @entity38 ; 8 @entity39 ; 9 @entity40 ; 10 @entity41 ‘ oh come on , guys ’ , @entity16 exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs			1
@entity1 fails to improve on his time , but it does n’t matter as @entity16 ca n’t beat his lap. it is @entity1 ’s pole			1
back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they ’re all on fresh tyres			0
here we go … meanwhile ... @entity20 crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the @entity57 pair of @entity35 and @entity36			1
we ’ve got four minutes to run			0
the @entity17 pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here			0
@entity37 is the first of the @entity21 drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than @entity1 on a used set of option tyres			1
and @entity1 crosses the line with a 1:35.782			0
what can @entity16 do ? the @entity17 man is 0.280secs slower than his team - mate			1
@entity36 is the first driver to post a competitive lap , and he crosses the start - finish line with a 1:37.903 … but it is @entity1 up next			2
we ’ll see two runs from each driver and @entity1 is the first of the @entity17 pair to take to the track			2
so , we ’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10 … surely , @entity1 wo n’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year ? so , surprisingly both @entity84 fail to make the top - 10 shootout with @entity86 and @entity87 to start 13th and 14th tomorrow			1
@entity1 remains the quickest man on the track			0
so , we ’re in the last minute of @entity90 and @entity35 , @entity41 , @entity40 and @entity91 are facing the drop			0
@entity20 crosses the line to go faster than @entity37 , but he is half - a - second off @entity1 ’s mighty lap. @entity37 goes third - fastest with a 1:37.1 , but the @entity95 is seven tenths slower than @entity1 … what can @entity20 do in the sister @entity21 ? neither @entity21 driver are yet to post a time , so the best of the rest behind the @entity17 pair is currently the @entity104 of @entity39 , 1.6 seconds slower than @entity1			1
that really is a stunning time from the world champion			0
@entity16 follows @entity1 across the line , but he is three tenths slower than his @entity17 team - mate			1
the @entity15 really appears to be a class above his @entity17 team - mate this weekend			1
@entity36 leads the way until @entity1 posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft - option tyre			2
he then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap ; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning			0
the second session is underway in @entity2 to determine which drivers will make it through to the top - 10 shootout			0
that ’s quite a big shock to see @entity125 on the penultimate row again			0
@entity127 , @entity128 and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend , but they will start tomorrow ’s race only 17th and 18th			1
so , the @entity125 drivers do not make it out of @entity136 and @entity127 and @entity128 will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow 's @entity137			1
but as i write that , @entity20 goes fastest with a 1:37.502			0
@entity140 , pastor @entity141 , @entity39 , @entity142 and @entity143 occupy the drop zone with a minute to go … @entity37 is back on track , on the softs , and it is the @entity95 ’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than @entity36			0
@entity36 and @entity35 are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon			0
@entity36 goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as @entity35 slots into third			0
@entity127 , also on the soft compound , is faster than @entity128 by four tenths , and he slots his @entity125 into @entity156			1
the @entity15 comes over the radio to complain that the ‘ rears are overheating ’			0
@entity128 is already donning the soft compound tyre			0
he comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap , but still manages to go eighth … for now			0
so , with 10 minutes to go , @entity1 leads the way from @entity16 , @entity164 , @entity40 , @entity20 , @entity37 and the ever - impressive @entity165			1
@entity16 is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team - mate			1
@entity164 , on the much faster softer compound tyre , pops his @entity171 into third			0
here comes @entity1 , who looks at ease in his @entity17 , and the @entity175 driver is 1.6 seconds faster than @entity20			1
@entity37 crosses the line to post a 1:40.917 , but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and @entity20 crosses the line to go one second quicker than his @entity21 team - mate			1
plenty of smoke as @entity1 ’s @entity17 is fired up , but there ’s no problem with the world champion ’s @entity186 as he takes to the circuit for @entity136			2
@entity37 meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap … @entity128 failed to post a time in this morning 's practice session , but the @entity192 is first out of the blocks as today 's qualifying session gets underway			2
security has been ramped up for this week ’s race in @entity197 after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday ’s second practice session			0
the local man darted across the start - finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the @entity21 garage			2
he is then alleged to have said : ‘ i want a car			0
i ’ve got a ticket			0
’ @entity16 has been challenged by @entity17 chairman @entity207 to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by @entity1 in both races so far this term			1
here , the @entity211 is taking part in his traditional warm - up before hopping into his mercedes for this afternoon ’s qualifying session			2
that said , @entity17 , and @entity1 in particular , appear to be back to their ominous best in @entity2			2
@entity1 has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole - sitter here in 2013 and again last year			2
the 30 - year - old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs , finishing 0.226secs quicker than team - mate @entity16			1
fresh from his win in @entity227 , @entity20 was the best of the rest , albeit some seven tenths down on @entity1 ’s best lap. good morning and welcome to our coverage of today ’s qualifying session for the @entity137			2
after @entity1 led @entity16 home in a @entity17 one - two at the curtain raiser in @entity237 , we were told a year of domination from the @entity186 loomed			1
but how wrong they were			0
@entity20 , in his @entity21 , upset the odds to roar to victory in @entity24 to blow the race for the championship back open and give @entity17 food - for - thought ahead of this week ’s @entity137 and for the remainder of the campaign .			1

@entity1 claimed his third straight pole position of the season
@entity16 was just 0.042secs slower than his @entity17 team - mate
@entity211 says : ' oh , come on , guys , ' when told he is slower than @entity1
@entity20 will start third for @entity21 with @entity35 fourth
@entity125 endured another *difficult* day with @entity127 and @entity128 only 17th and 18th on the grid for sunday 's race
