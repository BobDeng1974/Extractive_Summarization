it looks , and sometimes acts , like a huge sponge floating in space			0
but this crumpet - like rock is in fact one of @entity6 's outer moons , measuring 255 by 161 miles ( 410 by 260km )			1
named @entity9 , the moon 's porous surface can be seen in incredible detail in this image taken by @entity12 as it performed a flyby of the satellite			2
the floating bath sponge : this image shows one of @entity6 's outer moons , measuring 255 by 161 miles ( 410 by 260km )			1
@entity12 was around 38,500 miles ( 62,000 km ) from @entity9 when the image was taken @entity9 is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular			0
its odd , almost ' bubbly ' appearance , can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size , according to @entity25			1
this low density also means that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock			2
because of these properties the entire moon is porous , like a sponge , with well - preserved craters of various sizes packed together across its surface			0
scientists believe around 40 per cent of the moon is empty space			1
@entity12 was around 38,500 miles ( 62,000 km ) from @entity9 when the image was taken almost a decade ago			0
@entity41 has just released a refined , false - colour perspective of the moon in which its surface features were highlighted by toning down its natural redness			0
during the flyby , the probe got more than it bargained for as @entity9 unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft , effectively delivering a giant 200 - volt electric shock			2
it appears that @entity9 's surface becomes electrostatically charged as it is bathed in charged particles			1
these particles are constantly streaming out into space from the sun , but @entity9 also has to deal with ones trapped within the magnetic field of its host planet , @entity6			2
while astronomers expected many bodies throughout the solar system to be charged , the @entity12 data represents the first - ever experience of a charged natural object in space other than our moon			0
' this is comparable to what happens when you rub your hair against a balloon , or when a shirt or blouse rubs against a sweater , ' said professor @entity80 at @entity81			0
@entity9 is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular			0
its odd , almost ' bubbly ' appearance , can be attributed to it having a very low density for its size ' the large difference in potential between the surface and the spacecraft resulted in a flow of electrons being accelerated from @entity9 toward @entity12			1

scientists think that this moon is mostly made up of water ice , with small amounts of rock , and around 40 per cent of it is empty space			1

@entity41 has released an image of one of @entity6 's outer moons , @entity9
its bubbly appearance is *due* to it having a very low density for its size
scientists believe 40 per cent of the moon is made up of empty space
@entity9 has been known to unleash huge bursts of charged particles
