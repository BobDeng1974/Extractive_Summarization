by @entity0 last updated at 6:12 pm on 1st december 2011 ski resorts in @entity2 are continuing to struggle with a lack of snow - which has seen the cancellation of a series of @entity8 alpine races			1
the @entity10 resort of @entity11 was forced to abandon the event , due to take place on december 10 and 11 , because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent			0
its slopes , seen here in these staggeringly barren photographs , have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the @entity20 for 147 years			0
snow go area : the @entity11 resort in @entity10 has had the @entity8 alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow barren : the normally crisp white landscape is instead brown and green because of a lack of snow it 's snow joke : skiers walk around the resort of @entity11 in a state of bemusement because there is no snow barren : the slopes of @entity11 , seen here in these staggering photographs , have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the @entity20 for 147 years as it should be : @entity11 is usually covered in snow during the ski season @entity41 , @entity42 : there was a reported 0 - 61cm of snow today , said to be of ' good ' condition			1
the resort says snow is guaranteed from october through to may thanks to the high alpine location of the 148 km of slopes and the two glacier ski areas of @entity51 and @entity52			2
@entity53 , @entity42 : this resort in the ski region of @entity56 in @entity57 opened today and has 77km of slopes with 24 open lifts			0
as of this morning , much of this was artificial snow but skiiers have n't complained so @entity63 , @entity64 : surprisingly , this resort in the south - east of @entity64 has some good snow , particularly on the upper slopes			2
they are reporting a metre of snow on the upper regions with 41km of skiable @entity72 , @entity10 : according to the @entity77 's website , @entity75 were reporting ' a healthy 80cm upper slope depth ' - good news as the resort opens on @entity80 , @entity81 : this resort opens tomorrow when skiers can enjoy 141km of pistes			1
@entity86 's website says that the snow conditions are ' top ' on the @entity81 side and @entity90 side of the resort			0
in fact , it boasts : ' we â€™ve got snow , great snow ! ' information supplied by the @entity77 the hotter than usual weather is also posing problems across the rest of the continent , with a number of tourist destinations having had to postpone opening			1
@entity106 , in @entity42 , will not open for at least another week , and @entity107 , also in @entity42 , will not be taking skiers until december 15			0
in other areas the situation is so bad that people who have not yet booked their trips are being advised to only consider resorts with high - altitude ski areas			2
this is because springlike temperatures mean the snow line for many resorts is far higher than usual			2
@entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 have yet to open their main resorts			0
but it is not all bad news for @entity2 skiers			1
@entity127 has reported up to 55cm of snow in the past week , @entity86 in @entity81 is fully open , and @entity41 saw 24cm of fresh snow yesterday			1
@entity130 , information manager from the @entity77 said skiers should look to glacier resorts to be guaranteed snow but there are some non-glacial locations across @entity2 where you can still ski			1
he said : ' there is good news for @entity2 ski resorts as snow is forecast for this weekend and next week			1
' the heaviest snowfall is expected to fall at the western @entity2 resorts , but resorts in the east should receive fresh snow too			1
' around 40cm of new snow could fall over the next nine days in parts of @entity10 and @entity81			0
the fresh snow should dramatically improve the overall snow cover across the @entity20			1
' even without the fresh snow , many @entity2 resorts are hoping to open for the winter season this coming weekend thanks to the great efforts of grooming and snow making teams			1
' it has been snowing in @entity119 this week too and if the snowfall continues , as it is forecast to , then the @entity119 resorts should be able to open in the not too distant future			0
' the @entity156 said that a cold front was expected over mainland @entity2 by the end of this week , starting tomorrow			2
its report said : ' a glorious week of bright sunshine and clear skies is expected over the majority of our featured @entity2 resorts			2
far too green : these snowless slopes on the @entity167 mountain in the western @entity42 village of @entity169 were pictured last week depressing : a virtually snow - free @entity171 mountain in the western @entity42 city of @entity173 , pictured last week ' however , on friday 2nd december a drop in temperature is expected , snow is therefore forecast to fall , although this may only be across higher areas up			0
' but it warned that : ' at lower altitudes this could fall as rain			0
' the snow is expected to fall and settle at heights above 1,500m			0
over in @entity186 , where the @entity8 races will now take place at @entity190 resort in @entity191 , there has been no such problem			0
the start of the @entity195 ski season has seen a much better 1.2m fall of snow on @entity199 runs and up to 60cm of new powder on the @entity201			1
