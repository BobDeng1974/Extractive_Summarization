@entity0 reject @entity1 crossed for @entity2 as they kept alive their hopes of a domestic and @entity5 treble with a 24 - 20 win over @entity7			1
the wing , constantly overlooked by @entity9 , raced over for a fine first - half try as the hosts reached the @entity12			1
the win was extra sweet for @entity15 ’s men , who fought back from a 13 - 5 half - time deficit to avenge last year ’s defeat by @entity18 at the same stage			1
they also lost to them in the @entity22			0
@entity1 races away from two @entity7 defender to score a well - taken try @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a massive win			1

‘ we just went for it in the second half and got on top of them			0
but we now need to go on and win the @entity12			2
’ in the first hafl @entity7 had been totally dominant and looked in control of the match , building up a 13 - 5 half - time lead			1
however the home side , aided by the wind , launched a rally to run out narrow winners and so deprive @entity18 of a final appearance on their home ground			0
@entity7 selected a strong pack with @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 all included			0
@entity50 was at hooker for his 100th appearance for the @entity18 whilst flanker @entity53 returned after being out with an injury since november			0
the former @entity0 winger touches down in the corner as @entity2 reached the @entity12 saints began strongly and took an early lead			1
@entity59 first made a hash of a drop goal attempt but he was on target with a penalty after six minutes			0
the visitors should have extended that lead but blew a golden opportunity for the first try			0
a neat break from @entity68 was carried on by @entity69 but when the ball was recycled , @entity70 knocked on with the line in sight			0
saints continued to dominate the opening quarter with the home side unable to get out of their own half and they were rewarded when @entity59 fired over his second penalty with an excellent touchline kick			2
eventually @entity2 secured some possession to get a platform into the match			0
@entity84 made a strong run to put the visitors ' defence on the back foot before the centre was again involved when his skilfully timed pass sent @entity1 through a large gap through for the opening try of the game			2
@entity59 had scored the first try of the game for the @entity18 but @entity2 stormed back to make the final @entity97 came on for @entity2 replacing the injured @entity98 before @entity18 resumed control of the match			2
@entity101 again unlocked the defence to send @entity59 over for the try , which the outside half converted			0
when @entity7 surprisingly lost a scrum on half - way , @entity105 burst away and looked a likely score but he was overhauled by @entity49 , who pulled off a superb cover tackle to keep his side 13 - 5 ahead at the interval			1
within a minute of the restart , @entity2 scored a splendid try			0
@entity114 won a line - out and a pre-planned move put @entity117 in space for the wing to run elusively past a number of defenders for the try which @entity123 converted before the scrum half added a penalty to put the hosts in front for the first time			1
@entity114 gets up highest to secure line - out ball in an excellent second - half display from the home side assisted by the wind , @entity2 were a totally different proposition in the third quarter as it was now @entity18 ' turn to be hemmed in their own half and they fell further behind when @entity123 knocked over two further penalties			1
after 60 minutes , @entity18 introduced @entity138 and @entity139 at half - back in an attempt to revive their fortunes and it soon paid dividends with @entity139 nipped over on the blindside following a driving line - out with @entity138 converting with a brilliant touchline kick			2
@entity7 threatened a comeback but a late drop goal from @entity149 saw @entity2 to the final , where they will play either @entity151 or @entity152 , who play tomorrow			1
@entity154 is dragged down by @entity7 's @entity155 as @entity2 avenged last year 's losses			1

@entity7 had led 13 - 5 had half time but @entity2 fight back
*saracens* wing @entity1 scores excellent try in win
saints won at same stage last year , but @entity2 treble hopes stay alive
@entity2 will now play @entity151 or @entity152 in @entity12
