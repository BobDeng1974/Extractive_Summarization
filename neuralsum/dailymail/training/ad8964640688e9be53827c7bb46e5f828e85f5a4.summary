@entity0 has joined the growing list of footballers to pen an open letter to fans on leaving a club			1
@entity7 was at it when he left @entity9 for @entity10 before @entity11 playmaker @entity0 , who departed @entity12 for @entity13 after four years on @entity14 , said his goodbyes , wished the club well , thanked them for the memories , blah , blah , blah			1
we 've heard it all before and frankly , we 'd be happy if we never heard it again			2
so , scroll down for an open letter we 've written to players everywhere			1
video something else to cringe over : scroll down for @entity0 's tribute to @entity25 and he 's off : @entity0 wrote an open letter to @entity12 fans after leaving to join @entity13 write move : @entity7 also penned a message for fans of his old club when he joined @entity10 dear departing footballer , the time has come for us to say goodbye			1
thanks for the memories and all that - it 's been emotional			2
as you set out on the next stage of your career , we wish you well but would ask just one more thing of you			0
do n't worry , we wo nâ€™t expect you to take it easy when we play against your new team			0
no , our request is that you do n't write an open letter to the fans			1
please , please , please do n't write an open letter to the fans			1
whatever you do , do n't write an open letter to the fans			1
there 's no need to tell us about the special journey you 've been on over the past ( insert number here ) years as we were there , right with you , every step of the way			0
we paid ( lots ) for the privilege , making our own way there on planes , trains and automobiles - not luxury club coaches and private jets			2
with this in mind , we know we are fantastic supporters			0
so , no need to remind us of that fact either			0
do n't bang on about us all being part of one big family			0
granted , we shouted at you on boxing day one year but let 's be honest , we 'll never sit down for @entity80 dinner together and @entity81 would n't know you from @entity82			0
we know you 'll have many happy memories from your time with us , probably millions			0
and you know the bit about the ' special place in your heart ' that you were going to put near the end of your message ? it ca n't be that special as almost every player making a move during the recent transfer window claims to have the same place			2
anyway , hope this finds you well			0
best wishes , @entity97 , on behalf of the fans and another thing - nobody writes letters these days .			1
