@entity0 is the most popular player in the @entity1 after it was revealed that his name more than anyone else 's was emblazoned on the back of supporters ' shirts			2
findings published in the @entity9 revealed the @entity11 striker was ahead of @entity13 pair @entity12 and @entity14 in having the most fans use his name last season			2
it is the second year on the trot that @entity19 has topped the pile			0
@entity60 of course , @entity14 has since moved away from @entity61 - sealing a Â£ 75million deal with @entity63 - but @entity13 fans across the world previously flocked to have the @entity66 on their replica kit			0
on signing for @entity26 this time last year , @entity29 's reputation was plainly evident with hundreds of people pictured with the strip accompanied with the @entity74 star 's name ahead of his first game			1
unsurprisingly , @entity21 is consistently in the top 10 and that was no different in the last campaign			1
the continued sale of ' @entity81 ' shirts goes some way to explaining why @entity11 have always been so desperate to keep the striker and only heightens the perception that the club 's global brand is as important as results			1
@entity23 will be hoping new signing @entity88 makes enough of a mark to nestle in on this list next year , but performances do n't always dictate who finishes where on this particular list			0
a case in point is @entity56 , whose name has shifted loads of @entity11 shirts since his move from @entity102 - largely because of the @entity58 midfielder 's vast appeal in @entity59			1
@entity61 heroes : @entity14 ( who has since joined @entity63 ) and @entity12 shifted plenty of strips			0

@entity45 and @entity29 's names sold plenty of shirts
@entity26 , @entity11 and @entity35 *dominate* the top 10
@entity56 was the surprise name , with @entity60 tenth
@entity21 and @entity34 representing @entity11 in the list
