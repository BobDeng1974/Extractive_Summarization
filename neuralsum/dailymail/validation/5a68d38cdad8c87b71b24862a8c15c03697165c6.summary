bats are often associated with vampires , caves and other dark , creepy or dingy imagery			0
but this adorable little fruit bat wolfing down a banana is bound to change your perception			1
filmed by @entity9 , a lady who rescues and cares for fruit bats , the video shows a much sweeter side of what is usually considered a rather spooky animal			0
hungry fellow : the tiny fruit bat calms down completely when it spies a banana the bat appears to pull hilarious facial expressions as it tucks into the fruit snack munching on the banana , the wide - eyed bat looks extremely excited as it fills its mouth before lifting its head back in satisfaction			1
going in for another bite with even more enthusiasm , the bat opens its mouth as wide as it can and stuffs its face once more			2
looking at the camera while it finishes its mouthful , the bat takes one last big bite of the banana and uses its pointed tongue to help shovel down the food			1
before lifting its head one last time as if completely full and entirely satisfied			0
according to @entity38 , an abundance of rainfall in @entity36 , @entity37 in recent weeks has resulted in food supplies becoming scarce - as a result , this bat was rescued by a lady called @entity42			1
at one point the bat is even seen poking its tongue out as it makes sure it has eaten every last morsel @entity9 is among the people rescuing the bats from fruit netting during the poor weather			2
referencing the video , @entity9 said the fruit bat was initially a little feisty until it spied the banana			1
after that he was happy once and began stuffing his face with the food â€“ as is seen in the video			0
there 's no need to be scared of these bats judging by the adorable rescue animal at @entity9 's shelter @entity9 told @entity64 : ' rain is good news for the coming winter but it 's not such good news for hungry bat bellies			1
' although there is a magnificent array of native flowering occurring , rain washes the nectar and pollen out of the blossom and flying - foxes are forced to seek sustenance elsewhere			2
' as a result we get an increased number of calls for bats trapped in large aperture fruit tree netting during and after rain events			2
' @entity9 added : ' please net , grow and harvest sustainably			0
never use any netting you can poke your finger through and use shadecloth or a similar weave to protect your fruit			0
even better still , take what you need and share the rest with our wildlife			0
