it 's set be the one of the biggest – and certainly one of the most hyped – cinema releases of 2015			0
but as anticipation of the latest instalment in the @entity6 saga intensifies , so too does the lucrative merchandising industry surrounding it , along with fears that fans are being exploited			1
devotees of the sci - fi movies are already up in arms about a model of the @entity15 spaceship , commanded by @entity17 ’s character @entity16 , which is currently being advertised on tv			1
the model is built from a series of parts released every week along with a glossy magazine			1
‘ for that you could just buy @entity17 , ’ raged @entity33 on @entity34			0
fellow @entity34 user @entity36 added : ‘ i ’d want a ride on the real thing for that much			0
’ and @entity39 said : ‘ i bought my first car for less			0
’ the first issue of the @entity43 magazine costs £ 2.99 , but then the price soars to £ 8.99 , and publishers say there are at least 100 instalments , meaning it will take two years to build the spaceship			1
the cost of the magazines flashes up on tv screens for only a brief moment			2
many parents are trapped into buying every edition by ‘ pester power ’			2
@entity56 , from website @entity57 , said : ‘ asking parents to pay almost £ 900 for a toy is luring them into the financial dark side			2
‘ like a payday loan company glossing over its real apr , the true price is only displayed in tiny writing on the ads which parents may miss. and once they start buying , they are hooked in and committed to keep going or the family will be left with nothing but a few tiny sections of model for their money			2
‘ even the most expensive @entity73 version of the @entity15 is only about £ 100 , so this version is a rip - off which mums and dads must avoid			1
’ the new @entity6 film , @entity78 , is due out in december and director @entity79 has already raised anticipation by posting online photos of the new @entity15			1
however , the build @entity43 project has not impressed model - maker @entity85 , who has produced @entity6 - themed models for private clients			1
he said : ‘ there is no reason to stretch the project over two years			0
the first few magazines are available at newsagents , but you need to subscribe to get the rest so you are tied in			0
to be honest , i would prefer the cheaper one from @entity96			0
’ @entity97 , marketing director at @entity98 , the firm behind the magazine , said : ‘ we are sure that @entity6 fans and model makers will be delighted with it			1
it is a full - size model of the actual movie prop used in @entity107			2
‘ it needs 100 parts because it is a large and complex model			0
to be able to replicate the movie prop faithfully , we need that many			0

a magazine company is offering the chance to build the @entity15
the first edition of the magazine costs £ 2.99 but the next 100 are £ 8.99
fans have *expressed* outrage over the cost of the two - year *subscription*
