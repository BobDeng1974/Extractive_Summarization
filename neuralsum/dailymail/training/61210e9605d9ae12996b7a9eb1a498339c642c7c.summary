@entity0 is on course to take enough @entity3 votes to put @entity4 in power next year , according to a poll of marginal constituencies			1
the survey of ten conservative - held seats suggests the @entity11 party could tip the balance in favour of @entity14 in all but two of them			2
the findings will reinforce the central @entity3 message that @entity0 voters risk handing the election to mr @entity4 , who has effectively ruled out holding a referendum on @entity23 membership			0
new polling shows voters deserting the @entity3 for @entity0 will put @entity4 within touching distance of @entity26 but the poll , conducted for former @entity3 treasurer @entity28 , is not all good news for mr @entity4			2
it suggests he may have less chance of winning than he hopes because in seats where @entity0 is performing really well there are fewer voters switching directly to @entity14 from @entity3			1
lord @entity28 questioned more than 1,000 voters in conservative - held constituencies where @entity14 came second in 2010			1
the survey found a overall 5 per cent swing to @entity14 in these marginals – enough to snatch nine of them ( @entity41 & @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 & @entity47 , @entity48 & @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 )			1
but where @entity0 is doing well , @entity14 might not achieve a 5 per cent swing , because voters who might otherwise have switched straight from blue to red have opted instead for @entity0			2
lord @entity28 said that , coupled with previous surveys in more marginal @entity3 - held constituencies , the results suggested at least 29 seats would fall to @entity14 if the findings were repeated at the general election			1
but he said the swing varied ‘ significantly ’ depending on the @entity0 presence in each seat , with a strong showing from @entity68 ’s party enough to deny mr @entity4 a lead in @entity70 and @entity71 and threaten his chances in @entity46			0
‘ though nine of these seats would change hands on the basis of these snapshots , @entity14 will not feel comfortable in many of them , ’ said lord @entity28			1
labour leader @entity4 is on course to win the next election , according to a poll of marginal seats carried out by former @entity3 treasurer @entity28 prime minister @entity84 has lost crucial swing voters to @entity14 in marginal constituencies which hold the key to winning the next election ‘ @entity14 led by ten points in @entity45 and 13 points in @entity41 , they were ahead by less than five points in @entity43 , @entity50 , @entity46 & @entity47 and @entity52			1
‘ swings to @entity14 appear to be related to the @entity0 presence , which varied significantly from one seat to the next			0
‘ @entity68 ’s party scored just 7 per cent in @entity41 & @entity42 , where @entity14 ’s share was up 11 points since 2010 , but 24 per cent in @entity46 , where @entity14 were down by two points , though still just ahead			2
’ the findings will fuel concern in mr @entity4 ’s party that complacency about the impact on @entity14 of the @entity0 surge could rob them of victory next year			0
the @entity106 vote had fallen by more than half in nearly all seats surveyed , with just 23 per cent of those who voted @entity106 in 2010 saying they would do so again			0
in @entity44 the poll took into account the 2012 by - election			0
the seat had been won by the @entity3 in 2010 but went @entity14 when @entity114 resigned in 2012			1
the poll predicts @entity14 will hold the seat			0
meanwhile , a separate poll by @entity117 revealed proposed tax cuts are the most popular policies to emerge from the recent party conference season .			0

nine out of 11 marginal @entity3 seats are likely to vote for @entity14 in 2015
in each of the constituencies @entity14 finished second to the @entity3 in 2010
survey by @entity28 found an overall 5 *%* swing from @entity3 to @entity14
