@entity5 was driving home from church through @entity8 , @entity9 on sunday when he saw a doe get hit by a car			1
he pulled over to the side of the road to check on the deer and saw that it was too late			0
however , he noticed a movement in the deer 's abdomen and realized the female was pregnant			2
i 've got to do something , ' mr @entity5 told @entity37			2
so he took out his retractable box cutter he uses in his job as a landscaper and worked quickly to free the unborn fawn			1
' it was just nice to see how he came right out nice and smooth , ' mr @entity5 said , ' and i just worked the neck , because his neck came out first			2
' newborn : mr @entity5 was surprised by how easy the baby deer came out life begins : above , the first picture of the newborn fawn just minutes after birth rescued : mr @entity5 took pictures of the newborn fawn just after the emergency c - section on sunday mr @entity5 then drove 30 minutes to deliver the baby fawn to a wildlife rehabilitator after the fawn 's lucky birth , mr @entity5 drove 30 minutes to a wildlife rehabilitation center in @entity57 where he entrusted the newborn in the care of @entity60 , a licensed wildlife rehabilitator			1

' named : the rescued fawn has been nicknamed @entity23 by @entity60 and her family growing fast : @entity23 has started walking and is being kept in a playpen with two other rescued fawns ms @entity60 says it will take most of the summer to get @entity23 ready for the wild , but the fawn is already working towards that goal with its first visit outside earlier this week			1
