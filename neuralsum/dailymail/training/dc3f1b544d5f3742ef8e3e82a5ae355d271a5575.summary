mr @entity5 said : ' it ’s got pros and cons. i ’m happy with it , but it is a bit lonely			2
' it ’s mostly quiet , but every time i ’ve rented a house before there have been problems with neighbours with noise and that from the stereo			2
' if i had the choice between a quiet house and living in a kennel , i would have to pick the house , but this will do me for now			2
' back to nature : the kennel has two dog runs but no kitchen , so mr @entity5 usually eats pre-cooked or tinned food sprucing the place up : the unemployed artist has modernised his simple home by fitting a bed , carpet and a solar - heated shower few mod - cons : the little @entity10 hut has a portable toilet outside but no electricity mr @entity5 has not worked for more than two years and admits to being the ‘ black sheep ’ of his family , with no relatives who could help him out			1

toughing it out : mr @entity5 has been jobless for two years but is trying to save up his dole money to buy a home once his tent started to leak , sympathetic local farmer @entity76 said he could use the old hut			1
mr @entity5 said : ' i initially camped on his land , but bad weather ruined it , so i moved into the kennel			1
' there ’s no alarm on it or anything like that , but i ’m not saying i have any valuables , but you do worry about people coming in			2
' it ’s two kennels with dog runs that have not been used for ages			0
my single bed takes up a quarter of it			0
