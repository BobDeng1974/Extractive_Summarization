by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 is to be investigated by the @entity3 over claims of war crimes by troops			1
prosecutors in the @entity8 have launched a ' preliminary examination ' into allegations @entity2 forces tortured and mistreated @entity13 prisoners between 2003 and 2008			1
it is the first time the @entity3 , which usually prosecutes dictators who systematically maim and kill civilians , has investigated @entity2 for alleged war crimes			1
the prosecutor of the @entity3 says she has reopened a preliminary investigation into @entity13 to examine allegations that @entity2 soldiers may have committed war crimes by abusing prisoners from 2003 to 2008 ( file photo ) it took the first step towards a formal investigation after studying more than 400 allegations of beating , sexual assault , mock executions and electric shocks of @entity13 captives			1
the claims are made in a 250 - page dossier compiled by @entity35 ’s @entity34			0
it raises the prospect of soldiers , commanders and politicians , including four former @entity42 defence secretaries – @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 – who are named in the file being put on trial for war crimes			1
the move provoked anger among ministers and the military			0
colonel @entity54 , who commanded @entity2 forces in @entity56 , said : ‘ @entity34 , intent on discrediting the @entity58 , are slinging mud in every direction in the desperate hope that some will stick			2
‘ the @entity3 performs a valuable role in bringing war criminals to book from dictatorships that will not prosecute them			0
that does not apply to the @entity2 , which has the oldest - established and most highly respected legal system in the world			2
’ last night attorney general @entity69 said the @entity2 would co-operate fully but that the government ‘ completely rejected ’ the claim that @entity2 forces were responsible for systematic abuse			2
the @entity3 first looked at allegations of abuse in @entity13 in 2006 , but decided that an investigation was not needed because the claims were not serious or widespread enough			1
in a statement , prosecutor @entity77 said she would review ' new information ' she received in january alleging that @entity2 officials bear responsibility for wrongdoing yesterday @entity3 prosecutor @entity77 said an examination was being opened after ‘ new information ’ that the @entity2 was involved in alleged systematic abuse of detainees was received			1
mr @entity69 said he believed the @entity3 would decide there was no need for it to carry out a full investigation because @entity2 is already investigating claims of abuse in @entity13			1
one inquiry collapsed in march when lawyers admitted there was no evidence to support @entity13 claims that troops murdered prisoners and mutilated their bodies following a battle in 2004			1
the @entity100 , led by former civilian detectives , is currently dealing with a further 52 allegations of unlawful killing by @entity2 forces and 93 allegations of mistreatment following the toppling of @entity108			1
former defence secretary @entity43 is among those named in the file the @entity3 could take several years to decide whether to take its inquiry further but under its statute can intervene only when a nation is carrying out no effective investigation			0
the director of service prosecutions @entity116 - who is responsible for prosecutions of service personnel - said the @entity2 would co-operate fully with the preliminary examination by the prosecutor			1
he said was confident that the case would not move to a formal investigation as the @entity2 was already conducting its own inquiry through the @entity125 ( @entity100 ) established in 2010			1
under the @entity127 which established the @entity3 , the court can only intervene in cases where there is no effective investigation by the national authorities			2
' if the @entity3 is satisfied that the @entity2 is genuinely investigating these crimes , they will allow us to do that			1
' they may go on monitoring us for a number years in respect of investigations and prosecutions but they will not intervene , ' he said			0
' of course in the end it is for the prosecutor of the @entity3 to determine this , but i am confident based on the work that i 've seen that @entity100 has been doing , that the court will find that these are genuine criminal investigations that are taking place and they wo n't take it any further			2
' the preliminary examination was launched in response to a 250 - page dossier submitted to the prosecutors office in january by the @entity2 law firm , @entity34 , and the @entity159 for @entity162 and @entity163 - a @entity161 human rights organisation			2
former defence secretary @entity43 and former armed forces minister @entity164 are among those named in the file			0
the prosecutor 's office will now study the dossier alongside submissions from the @entity2 government and other relevant bodies - a process that could take several years before a final decision is taken on whether to move to a full investigation			1
' the preliminary examination is the first step in a process , ' mr @entity176 said			0
' the preliminary examinations can carry on for a very lengthy period			0
there have been preliminary examinations going on for years			0
' the @entity100 , led by a former civilian police detective , is looking into 53 cases of alleged unlawful killing and a further 93 cases of alleged mistreatment			0
today 's announcement follows the news in march that a legal firm took £ 2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of @entity13 men - even though the investigation 's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence			1
@entity202 - based public interest lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 @entity13 who claimed the men were taken prisoner by @entity2 soldiers , and later mistreated and murdered			1
despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week , the @entity206 confirmed that it has spent more than £ 22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £ 2.5million over to @entity34 run by the ' committed socialist ' solicitor @entity35			2
probe : despite the money that went to @entity34 , allegations that soldiers had executed @entity13 captives were unfounded			1
the above photograph , shown during the inquiry , shows a soldier guarding prisoners a spokesperson for the @entity206 told @entity220 : ' the £ 2.5 million has all gone to @entity221 [ @entity34 ] but that ’s not just legal costs			0
it ’s also the cost for witnesses : expenses for witnesses to come over from @entity13 and to hear some of them via video link from overseas			2
' it is understood that the money received by @entity34 included covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in @entity2 , as the @entity235 's chairman sir @entity234 wanted to see them face - to - face			2
it also included the building of - and transport to and from - a ' small studio ' close to @entity13 from which an additional 40 family members of the deceased gave evidence			0
as public interest lawyers were the only legal firm working with the @entity235 , all the expenses of gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said			0
money : @entity202 - based @entity34 , run by @entity35 ( pictured ) , received £ 2.5 million in taxpayers money for representing the relatives of more than 20 @entity13 at the @entity235 @entity34 is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained , ill - treated , or killed by @entity2 forces in @entity13			1
it has secured more than £ 3million in payouts , most notably , representing the family of @entity257 - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in @entity13			2
the subsequent inquiry cost £ 13million			0
responding to claims that @entity34 earned , as opposed to received £ 2.5million from the inquiry , @entity35 said : ' the amount of costs @entity221 has received from the @entity265 [ not legal aid ! ] for that issue is less than £ 70,000			0
' in the same month the primary strand of the @entity235 effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in @entity2 custody			0
in a statement released as evidence drew to a close , @entity34 accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight , dubbed the @entity278 , near @entity279 in 2004			0
they admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully			0
the extraordinary concession provoked outrage that @entity2 troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names ' dragged through the mud ' by publicly - funded lawyers .			0

prosecutor @entity77 said she would review ' new information '
