by @entity0 published : 03:13 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:10 est , 28 february 2014 @entity4 owner @entity3 has launched a robust defence of his tenure in @entity7 and believes he has been portrayed unfairly as a villain			1
@entity3 's time at the @entity10 has been hounded by controversy with the owner changing the club 's colours , much to the displeasure of the fans , and sacking promotion - winning manager @entity17 after rows over transfers			1
the @entity21 businessman , however , insists that he retains the backing of the majority of @entity4 fans and believes he has been given a rough ride by the @entity27 press , who he branded ' a little bit racist '			1
' do you think that @entity17 would have got us promoted without my investment ? without me giving him money ? after we got promoted the fans were all very supportive , everybody was appreciative , ' he told @entity36			1
thumbs up : controversial owner @entity3 claims he has backing from ' 90 per cent ' of @entity4 supporters ' overall , even now , i think , i would say even 90 per cent of the fans are supportive , the problem is you have 10 per cent or five per cent or maybe even a few hundred people that are not supportive , who are more vocal			1
' and then you have the @entity27 press who have has been misled by some people , feeding them wrong information and saying what a terrible person i am and trying to make fun of me and paint me like a villain			0
' but my experience is the majority are very supportive			0
i go to the club , many people come and shake my hand , want to shake hands with me , want my autograph , so generally i think it is not too bad			2
' i will say that the @entity27 press is unfair and maybe they are unfair because because we did n't tell our side of the story that well			0
under fire : the @entity21 owner has claimed he will quit @entity4 if the club 's supporters ' really p * * * me off ' anger : @entity4 fans are disappointed with @entity3 's treatment of the club 's former manager @entity17 protest : but @entity3 insists only a ' few hundred people ' oppose his ownership of the south @entity7 outfit flop : @entity77 left the club in january ' and sometimes the @entity27 press ( are ) maybe a little bit racist and quite unfair			1
' @entity3 claimed that his family want him to leave the troubled @entity82 club , who are in the relegation zone , but added he will only quit if the fans ' p * * * him off '			1
' some of my family members really want me to leave			2
they think it 's not worth it			2
they think no - one is grateful , but you have to be patient , accept the criticism and sometimes the insults , ' said @entity3			1
' right now at this point of time , i will stay , unless the fans really p * * * me off so much , then i will leave			1
' @entity17 was dismissed in december amid claims from @entity3 that he vastly overspent in the summer and chief executive @entity101 recently released a statement criticising the £ 7.6million signing of striker @entity77 , who left the club in january after not scoring a goal			1
@entity4 made an £ 8.5m loss on the @entity107 , when wages and agents ' fees are included			2
@entity17 has since been replaced by @entity111 and @entity3 is confident that the @entity112 can keep the club in the @entity82 , despite them currently being three points adrift of safety			1
' we overspend on the transfer			0
he was supposed to spend £ 35m which is what i agreed to put in			0
we bought the wrong striker who does not score any goals , ' @entity3 said			2
out : @entity17 was sacked by @entity3 last year despite steering the club to the @entity82 ' he ( @entity17 ) did n't do very well at @entity124 , but somehow our ceo and our chairman hired him and replaced @entity127			1
' @entity127 actually did much better			0
so i think @entity129 got lucky when he came to @entity4			1
' he added : ' although we 're not doing very well now , we are in the relegation zone , i 'm convinced and believe that @entity111 will be able to keep us in the @entity82			0
' despite the criticism , @entity3 insists he is in it for the long haul at @entity4 and believes that eventually the fans who are against him will be made to eat their words			1
man in charge : @entity3 is confident @entity111 can keep @entity4 in the top flight ' the club would have gone bust many times if i had not been around , ' he said			1
' i came to invest in the club and i just put in some money and i thought that 's about it , actually i did n't know the club was in such bad shape			2
' i made a decision and when i make a decision to do something i want to stick by it and see it through ( to ) the end and make it a success			0
and likewise the same for @entity4			2
' we were going through some difficulties , we had the wrong people doing things for us but i think we will get it right			0
' and i think when this thing is over , fans will understand and they should regret what they have done to me and maybe some of them should apologise to me			0
' in the spotlight : @entity3 has defended his decision to wear sunglasses and leather gloves at @entity4 games @entity3 , who is well known for wearing his @entity4 strip over his shirt and tie , while sporting leather gloves and sunglasses , also insisted he will not revert the club 's colours back to their traditional blue			1
' there is no way i will change it back to blue under my ownership , ' he said			2
' perhaps they can find an owner who likes blue and buy me out			0
sure , he can change it to blue after that			0
i 'll go somewhere and do another red club			0
' i wear sunglasses because of the glare of the spotlights			0
i wear gloves because it is very cold in the @entity27			0
frankly , sometimes i think they are nuts making all these comments			0
