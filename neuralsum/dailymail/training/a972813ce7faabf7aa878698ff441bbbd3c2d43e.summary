by @entity0 for the @entity1 a @entity2 minister called last night for cannabis to be legalised for medical use			1
@entity5 said the drug could help relieve symptoms for sufferers of conditions such as multiple sclerosis and help those having chemotherapy			1
but the @entity15 minister 's suggestion was dismissed by a @entity17 spokesman who pointed to ' clear evidence cannabis can damage people 's mental and physical health '			1
drugs minister @entity5 wants cancer sufferers to be allowed to use cannabis to alleviate pain mr @entity5 's comments are the latest in a series from @entity2 ministers pressing for a softening of drugs laws			1
opponents of allowing cannabis for medical purposes insist it could be used as a back door to decriminalising the drug more widely			2
but mr @entity5 said there was a ' growing body of research ' showing the ' medical properties ' of cannabis			2
he proposed the change in a letter to health secretary @entity44 which was leaked to @entity46 newspaper			1
' it is time to reconsider the medicinal properties of cannabis , given what i 've learned in my role as a minister , ' wrote mr @entity5			1
' i 've seen more and more evidence that cannabis can provide genuine medical benefits to treat a number of conditions			2
the @entity60 state of @entity61 made history on @entity63 this year - becoming the first to allow cannabis to be sold over the counter			0

the drug is still illegal under federal law			2
' there is a growing body of research that shows the medical properties of chemical components of cannabis			2
' i am uncomfortable that there are credible people i have met who tell me that cannabis is the only substance that helps relieve their condition			0
but not only are they stopped from accessing it officially but have to break the law to help their health			0
' other countries recognise that cannabis does have medicinal benefit and we need to look again at this to help people who are ill. this is a quite separate matter from recreational use which is not at issue here			0
' he suggested cannabis could be used to help conditions such as ms and glaucoma			0
in addition , it could be used to combat the side - effects of treatment for cancer , @entity116 and @entity118 's disease			1
campaigners for wholesale changes to drugs legalisation welcomed his intervention			0
last week , mr @entity5 's party leader @entity123 pledged to abolish prison terms for users caught with any drugs , including class a substances such as cocaine and heroin			0

cannabis can bring relief to patients suffering from the side effects of cancer and @entity116 treatment the law currently allows drugs firms to develop medicines based on cannabis under a licence granted by the @entity15			1
one such medicine , @entity145 , is already authorised for use in the @entity147 for the treatment of @entity149 however , a @entity15 spokesman said : ' this government has no plans to legalise cannabis or to soften our approach to its use as a medicine			1
' there is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people 's mental and physical health			1
our cross-government strategy remains clear			0
' we must prevent drug use in our communities , support users through treatment and recovery , and tackle the organised criminals behind the drugs trade			1
' there has been a long - term downward trend in drug use over the last decade			0
