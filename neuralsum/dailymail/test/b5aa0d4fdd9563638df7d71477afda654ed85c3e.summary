@entity0 hit his critics for six as @entity2 trounced @entity3 to reach the @entity5 semi-finals on tuesday night			1
it was an emphatic statement of intent : the @entity9 juggernaught is steaming towards the final in @entity11 on june 6			0
the six goals smashed past the hapless @entity14 pretenders in the quarter - final second leg at the @entity16 now takes @entity2 's goals total for the season to a spectacular and barely believable 115			1
and they 're not done yet , not by a long way			0
@entity2 still have five @entity21 matches to play as they march towards a third consecutive title , the @entity23 semi-final against @entity25 on april 28 , and potentially three @entity5 matches , should they reach the final			0
if @entity0 's goalscoring machine churns them out at their current rate of 2.61 per game , that would mean an eyewatering total of 141 goals for the season			2
it is n't @entity0 who should be feeling the pressure - it 's the rest of @entity37			0
here is a breakdown of @entity2 's staggering goalscoring so far this season @entity2 celebrated a 6 - 1 @entity5 victory over @entity3 to continue their incredible scoring @entity43 ( left ) heads in the opening goal of @entity2 's rout against @entity3 @entity46 ( centre ) scores his team 's third goal against @entity3 at @entity16 on tuesday @entity50 ( left ) scores his side 's opening goal against @entity53 last saturday @entity46 ( second left ) scores past @entity55 during @entity2 's win at @entity57 in november @entity58 ( left ) celebrates his goal after slotting past @entity61 goalkeeper @entity60 ( right ) @entity62 slots home a penalty against @entity64 at @entity16 in march @entity65 celebrates scoring @entity2 's third goal against @entity67 in february @entity69 ( 17 ) slots home unmarked against @entity64 in february @entity71 ( 28 ) heads in @entity2 's fifth goal against the @entity75 side during another emphatic victory			1
