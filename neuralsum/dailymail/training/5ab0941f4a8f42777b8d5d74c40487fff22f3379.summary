the spokesman for @entity1 who brazenly declared that jihadists would ‘ raise the flag of @entity3 in the @entity4 ’ has been killed by a @entity7 air strike , according to a message posted on social media			1
a @entity11 account said of the gun - toting @entity13 representative : ‘ this brother @entity15 was martyred during missile clashes at the @entity18 airbase			1
’ his death has not yet been officially confirmed			2
in a video for @entity36 , he said : ‘ i say to @entity37 that the @entity38 has been established and we will not stop			2
do n’t be cowards and attack us with drones			2
‘ instead send your soldiers , the ones we humiliated in @entity43			0
we will humiliate them everywhere , @entity46 willing			0
and we will raise the flag of @entity3 in the @entity4			0
’ @entity26 recently granted a journalist access to @entity1 fighters and even took him to the frontline in @entity7 the news follows the revelation that at least one in four of the estimated 2,000 foreigners fighting for @entity1 in @entity7 and @entity43 is @entity53 - and half of those are already back in the @entity53			1
serious questions have been raised as to whether enough is being done to stem the flow of fighters after the government revealed it has only seized 23 passports this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone			1
the government says there are around 500 @entity53 among the fighters while a further 250 are thought to have already returned to the @entity53 where the police and security services are attempting to watch them			2
that means there are now almost three times as many @entity53 @entity72 fighting for @entity73 than there are serving in the @entity53 military , an mp has claimed			0
@entity73 released a video purportedly of @entity43 's minority @entity79 taking part in a conversion ritual at an unknown location but @entity83 , @entity84 mp for @entity85 , told @entity86 the lack of border controls meant the government ’s estimates of jihadi numbers were too low			0
‘ i think it ’s about 2,000 people , ’ he added			0
according to the @entity95 , there are around 600 @entity53 muslims currently serving in the @entity97 - just 0.4 per cent of total personnel			0
this is far below the 4.3 per cent of the @entity53 population as a whole who are @entity103			0
@entity105 police also believe that 30 jihadists are using the country as a base while travelling to and from @entity7 and @entity43			1
the murder of @entity110 apparently by ' @entity111 ' - one of a gang of @entity53 jihadis known as ' @entity114 ' - has raised fears the killing fields of @entity7 and @entity43 are dominated by extremist @entity53			1
@entity117 fighters stand on a vehicle with a @entity120 flag as they guard @entity121 in northern @entity43 , which was in the hands of @entity1			1

a @entity11 account said @entity13 man @entity21 has been killed
it said : ' this brother @entity15 was martyred during missile clashes '
@entity26 granted a journalist access to @entity1 fighters at the @entity7 frontline
while there he astonishingly broke off an interview to fire at troops
