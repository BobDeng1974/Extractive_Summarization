@entity1 manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by @entity7 some are obvious - do n't buy a one - way ticket with cash the day before flying , although others are less so - do n't look scruffy while traveling on a diplomatic passport			1
the manual states : ' mental preparation almost certainly helps travelers pass secondary scrutiny			2
' the guide states that travelers who attract attention and appear suspicious qualify sentence meanings with ' words like “ typically , ” “ normally , ” “ often , ” “ maybe , ” or “ almost ” or phrases like “ to be honest , ” “ the truth is , ” or “ swear to @entity39			0
' there is a section devoted to baggage and lists reasons for detection including : baggage or contents inconsistent with the passenger 's appearance , profession , or ticket class an unexplained lack of baggage probably would raise suspicions			0
multiple new items , such as alarm clocks or notebooks , in baggage			0
carelessly packed baggage when passenger is purportedly an experienced business traveler			0
unopened and unmarked maps , guidebooks , or other literature			0
maps of unrelated cities in baggage for a purported tourist traveler			0
camera quality not matching the traveler 's profile or camera memory card insufficient for a lengthy tourist trip			0
the documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders the guide lists countries which look for certain types of travelers - for example it states @entity83 customs officials pay attention to single , @entity86 travelers ' because they may be drug couriers			1
' similarly it states that in @entity90 , officials are on the look - out for ' military - aged males traveling alone with backpacks ... regardless of their nationality or skin color			0
in one incident during transit of a @entity102 airport in the early morning , security officials selected a @entity1 officer for secondary screening , ' one of the documents reads			1
' although the officials gave no reason , overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic - passport holder may have prompted the referral			0
' the @entity1 agent involved went on to have his bag swabbed for explosives and it tested positive			2
despite extensive questioning , he stuck to his cover story that he had been involved in counterterrorism training in the @entity116 , and eventually was allowed to continue his journey			0
' consistent , well - rehearsed , and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it , ' the @entity1 wrote			2
@entity8 founder @entity121 said in a statement : ' the @entity1 has carried out kidnappings from @entity125 states , including @entity126 and @entity127 , during the @entity129 administration ' in a statement , @entity8 said this example ' begs the question : if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story , what was a @entity1 officer really doing passing through ( a @entity125 ) airport with traces of explosives on him , and why was he allowed to continue ? ' one of the @entity1 documents , called ' @entity143 , ' reveals that the @entity1 is very concerned about @entity125 nations introducing biometric security measures for people traveling on @entity116 passports and that new systems pose an increased ' identity threat ' - in other words , making it harder for agents to travel on false documents			1
the document focuses on the @entity125 's @entity155 area , a chunk of @entity102 in which travelers between 22 @entity125 countries are no longer required to show passports			2
the @entity1 expressed concerns that a new @entity125 security system will potentially make life harder for @entity1 agents			1
@entity8 founder @entity121 said in a statement : ' the @entity1 has carried out kidnappings from @entity125 states , including @entity126 and @entity127 , during the @entity129 administration			1
