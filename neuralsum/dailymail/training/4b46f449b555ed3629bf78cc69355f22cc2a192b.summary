@entity0 : ' lacking in confidence ' a mother of twins who had longed to have children committed suicide because she thought she was an inadequate parent			1
@entity0 , 42 , had struggled to conceive , eventually succeeding after lengthy fertility treatment			1
but she went on to become acutely depressed even though she was caring well for newborns @entity7 and @entity9			1
three months after their birth , the married former hotel manager jumped from the top of a @entity15 multi-storey car park			1
an inquest heard mrs @entity0 had been referred to a mental health team and became ‘ paranoid ’ about social services wanting to take her babies away			1
her mother @entity20 criticised the medical support she was given , telling the hearing : ‘ all that happened was that @entity0 went to the doctor and came home with another batch of tablets			1
' i was expecting things to move a little bit faster			2
she should have had more and quicker help from the agencies			2
‘ i saw her deteriorate over these few weeks day by day			2
she never spoke about suicidal thoughts to anyone			2
she had this horrendous fear if she did that her babies would be taken from her			0
’ scene : mrs @entity0 scaled a 7ft wall and fell from the top of @entity40 's @entity15 car park ( file picture ) recording a suicide verdict , @entity40 coroner @entity42 said it had been a ‘ harrowing ’ inquest , adding : ‘ it must have been agonising for all @entity0 ’s family to witness her change from a happy , lively , bubbly personality into a withdrawn woman with no self - respect			1
’ it is a common form of depression which affects around one in six women after they have given birth			1
however , postnatal depression ( @entity57 ) often remains undiagnosed , with only one in four cases diagnosed and treated			0
it starts from two weeks to several months after delivery , but often develops slowly - making it very difficult for doctors to diagnose and hard for the mother to recognise her symptoms			1
it is not known exactly what causes postnatal depression , but it is thought that biological , psychological and social factors all play a role			0
experts say that women who have a history of depression are more likely to suffer from the condition than those who have not			0
some research has shown that postnatal depression is caused by a sudden drop in oestrogen and progesterone after birth			1
during pregnancy there is a surge in the levels of these two hormones			0
however , after giving birth to your baby and having the placenta removed , these hormone levels drop back down to normal			2
scientists believe this rapid drop of hormones can trigger a chemical imbalance in the brain causing postnatal depression			0
psychologists believe that a variety of psychological issues could also be to blame			0
although it is hard to pinpoint exactly what causes the condition , it is thought that feelings of isolation and unresolved issues from the past can trigger the condition			0
mrs @entity0 and husband @entity107 had tried hard to have children before she finally became pregnant through intrauterine insemination – in which sperm are placed into the womb when an egg is released			1
she was overjoyed to discover she was carrying twins			0
in october 2012 one baby was delivered naturally and the other by caesarean section , but both were healthy			0
mrs @entity0 looked after the children to an ‘ extremely high standard ’ but developed an irrational belief she was not good enough to care for them , the inquest heard			1
she sought help and one of her gps told the hearing @entity128 had been treated with anti-depressants in the past			0
in november 2012 , the new mother was thought to be only a ‘ moderate ’ suicide risk			0
but the following month gp @entity133 said her mood was ‘ very low and she seemed lacking in confidence ’			0
mrs @entity0 talked about harming herself and was referred to a mental health team			1
over the @entity139 she appeared to be improving but two days before the tragedy , on january 13 last year , she was quiet and withdrawn at another consultation			0
dr @entity142 said : ‘ @entity0 felt guilty because the people around her expected her to be in a certain way … but she was feeling anything but happy inside			1
she found that very difficult to deal with			2
’ health visitor @entity147 added : ‘ she was struggling to believe in herself as a new mum			0
' i told her it is quite a stressful time and having two babies has a massive impact			0
’ three - day hearing : the inquest at @entity156 ( pictured ) was told that @entity128 and her husband tried hard to have children before she fell pregnant through @entity160 - intrauterine insemination mrs @entity0 scaled a 7ft wall at the car park in @entity40 and landed on a car			1
the coroner said while treatment was ‘ ultimately ineffective ’ , he believed it was offered ‘ promptly and appropriately ’ .			2
