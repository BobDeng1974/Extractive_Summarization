a young herring - gull will need specialist care for years after cruel yobs attacked it with spray paint			1
the bird was taken in by @entity5 , @entity6 , after she was found covered in thick red paint			1
the baby gull , who rescuers have named @entity11 due to her new colour , is only a few months old and now faces a couple of flightless years while waiting for the damaged feathers to fall out			1
a young herring - gull was discovered with her feathers painted red after it was taregted by yobs @entity21 , 25 , who runs the sanctuary , said @entity11 will not be able to live among the other gulls because she will be the victim of bullying			1
she said : ' she will be staying here at the sanctuary for a couple of years			0
' she wo n't be able to fly now because the paint has made the feathers rock hard and stiff			1
she keeps looking at her feet because they are so red but there is not way to wash it off			2
' it will take a couple of years for the paint to come off in the malt			2
there is no way to cut the feathers for them to grow back so you would have to pull them all out which i am not going to do			2
' i already have a gull pen with about 30 other rescue gulls but she is likely to be bullied			1
' i 'm going to build a new pen just for her because the gulls will know that something is wrong and they will pick up on that			2
' the bird , named @entity11 , will need specialist care for two years after the paint ruined her feathers			1
she is being held by wildlife expert @entity21 she explained that the sanctuary had received calls earlier in the week from concerned members of the public who had spotted @entity11 , so they put an appeal out on the lookout for the injured gull before she was found alone on an industrial estate yesterday			1
@entity11 will now need to be nurtured back to health			2
' she is only a baby and so she is unable to fly at the moment which means she is fairly easy to get hold of , ' she said			0
' it looks like the paint that is used on the road			2
i think two people must have painted her because they have lifted her wings to paint underneath			0
one person would have held her and the other would have painted			0
' she 's going to need a lot of @entity76			0
the paint is very fumy and i 've had to keep her in a well aerated room			0
she smelt terrible when she was found and that amount of fumes would make breathing quite difficult			0
the baby gull , who rescuers have named @entity11 due to her new colour , is only a few months old and now faces a couple of flightless years while waiting for the damaged feathers to fall out an appeal was put out to find @entity11 after concerned members of the public saw she has been targeted ' they have painted her face and so i am taking her to the vet to make sure she did n't breathe too much of it in			1
' the sanctuary owner is now building @entity11 her very own pen - kitted out with a paddling food and an abundance of food			1
she said : ' once she is outside in her pen she will have lots of baths and her own paddling pool			0
because we are based in @entity107 a lot of fishmongers give fish cut offs so she will have plenty of food			0
' the bird is n't suitable for the wild and is not suitable to be with her own kind			0
the feathers are ruined and because she is a sea bird she needs to be well oiled which means she is no longer waterproof			1
people need to know the dangers			0
it 's just disgusting that people can do this			2
' a police spokesperson said officers received a call from a member of the public who had found the young seagull on @entity126 in @entity107 covered in red paint			1
' police will be working with the @entity129 to find out who was responsible			0
' anyone who has any information about the incident or knows who is responsible , is asked to contact @entity135 on 101			0

the young herring - gull was sprayed all over with red paint by cruel yobs
the bird was taken in by @entity5 in @entity6
' @entity11 ' will not be live among other gulls as she will be victim of bullying
