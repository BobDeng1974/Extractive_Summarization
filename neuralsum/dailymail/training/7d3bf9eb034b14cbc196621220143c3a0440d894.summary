for years , @entity0 tried in vain to track down the daughter she had been forced to give up for adoption as a toddler			1
but with only first names to go on and no idea of the surname of the adoptive parents , she drew a blank			0
as a last resort , she typed the name @entity12 into @entity13 – and found herself looking at profiles of hundreds of women with that name			1
reunited at last : @entity0 , 41 , with her long - lost daughter , @entity17 , 22 recognition : the pair were reunited after @entity0 spotted a photo of her daughter on @entity13 although it seemed like an impossible task , she sifted through each one until , astonishingly , she stumbled upon the picture of a twentysomething woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to her own younger self			1
convinced that @entity17 could be the toddler she gave up for adoption 19 years ago , 41 - year - old mrs @entity0 sent her a friend request – and within five minutes of messaging on the site the pair had confirmed their remarkable connection			1
mrs @entity0 and miss @entity17 have been inseparable since meeting for the first time a week ago and yesterday celebrated their first @entity35 together since 1995			1
the delighted mother said : ‘ i had been searching for @entity12 for seven years but did n’t know the surname of her adoptive parents			1
in desperation i started searching for plain @entity41 on @entity13			2
‘ when i saw @entity12 ’s picture i thought she was the spitting image of me			1
as soon as we met i hugged her so tight i almost broke her neck			0
i ca n’t believe i ’ve finally found her			2
’ miss @entity17 , who had been living in @entity46 , @entity47 , less than 20 miles from her birth mother ’s home in @entity50 , said : ‘ it ’s fantastic , like we have never been apart			1
‘ i had started searching for my birth mother three months earlier			0
i always knew we would be reunited , i just never imagined it would happen so soon			0
’ mrs @entity0 gave @entity12 up for adoption after social workers intervened because she was in a violent on - off relationship with the girl ’s father			1
she went on to have a son , @entity59 , with another partner before marrying former farm worker @entity61 , 39			0
mrs @entity0 , a full - time carer for her disabled husband , did not know what her daughter looked like when she typed ‘ @entity12 ’ into @entity13 ’s search facility last november			1
stunned by @entity68 ’ close resemblance to her own appearance two decades earlier , she showed the picture to mr @entity61 , who urged her to make contact			0
mrs @entity0 had also commissioned a tracing agency to try to track down her daughter			1
the agency had found a possible address and was writing to miss @entity17 when mrs @entity0 sent her a friend request			2
separated : @entity12 was taken from @entity0 when she was just two and placed in foster care identical : the profile pictures @entity12 posted on @entity13 looked exactly like photos of @entity0 at the same age miss @entity17 accepted the following morning and the pair began messaging			1
minutes later , the connection was made when mrs @entity0 said she was waiting for some important news about the daughter she had not seen for 19 years			2
miss @entity17 asked what the daughter ’s name was and was told it had been @entity87 but that she had been adopted			0
miss @entity17 then simply replied : ‘ mum ! ’ she followed it with another message : ‘ i ’m @entity12			2
my last name was @entity94 but then i was adopted ’ , and the pair then confirmed miss @entity17 had the correct date of birth			0
relieved : @entity0 says she now has the chance to be the mother she 's always wanted to be to @entity12 they spent five months messaging and texting each other until @entity68 , who now lives in @entity99 , plucked up the courage to meet her mother last week			1
miss @entity17 , a care worker , said she has a strained relationship with her adoptive parents but gets on better with her older adoptive brother			0
she bought mrs @entity105 a purse , chocolates and candles for mothering sunday			0
she said : ‘ it has been very emotional , it ’s taken me six months to pluck up the courage to meet her and i ’m so glad i did			0
‘ i ’ve found my biological mum and we have loads in common			0
it was crazy to see that picture that looked just like me			2
’ mrs @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m over the moon to have my daughter back			2
i now can hopefully be the mum i always wanted to be			0
’ @entity68 ’ adoptive parents declined to comment .			0
