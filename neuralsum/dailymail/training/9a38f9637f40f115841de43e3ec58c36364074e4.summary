mr @entity11 ( right ) leaving the @entity7 @entity36 a free man for the second time with his lawyer @entity39 ( left ) ' i 've prepared myself for the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) appealing again , so that 's still an option they can exercise			1
' before the court 's decision , mr @entity11 said he would try to leave for @entity16 immediately if the prosecution 's appeal was rejected			1
