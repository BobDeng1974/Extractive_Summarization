in the show , dr @entity34 shares the results of a large scientific study where experts have followed 100 cats fitted with @entity41 trackers and cameras in three urban environments			1
in particular , the experts looked at what makes the domestic cat a fighting machine by examining a city cat called @entity48			1

the tracking equipment revealed that farm cats spread out across a rural area the size of 15 football pitches , including fields and wooded areas to maximise their chances of catching prey			0
unlike pampered cat that typically play with mice – because they do not need to eat prey to survive – the farm cats can kill a mouse in two seconds flat			2

one cat specialist said their hunting methods were ' almost indistinguishable ' they are almost always in a crouched posture , even when they run at full speed			0
professor @entity91 explained that this position is why the cats are so agile and stealthy			2
he said domestic cats ’ posture is ‘ almost indistinguishable ’ from that of a big cat			1

cats first move their ears to locate their target and their pupils dilate seconds before they pounce , showing their heightened sensitivity and state of arousal			0
their hind quarters also shake , which is perhaps to warm up their muscles			0
@entity141 , domestic cats are just as powerful as big cats – if not more so - and thanks to their flexibility they are in some ways better athletes , he said			1
domestic cats have retained their hunting instinct , even though most do n’t have a need to hunt because they are fed at regular intervals by their owners			1
the programme shows that the village and city cats tracked with gps collars still hunt in nearby woods , and bring home kills at least four times a week , including large birds such as seagulls			1
sandwich , a village cat , is filmed mimicking the sounds of birds as an attempt to lure her prey down			0
cat behaviour dr @entity166 , of the @entity168 , said that cats locate the prey , capture it , kill it and them shake the animal to loosen muscles before consuming it			1
but well - fed house cats play with prey before killing it because they are not dependent on the nutrients to survive , but they are still satisfying their hunting instinct			2

they do n’t waste any of a carcass in the wild , and crunch the bones for nutrients			0
they get most of their water from the meat , too			0
