by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 11:31 est , 28 november 2012 killed : @entity1 was considered a mentor to the @entity3 he trained , but now it is thought that @entity1 sexually abused his murdered at a young age a former scoutmaster who had deep local ties to his @entity9 community was brutally murdered over the summer and was found with his throat slit and multiple stab wounds over his body			1
@entity1 was considered a mentor to the @entity3 he trained , but months after his grisly murder , darker questions have arisen			1
@entity16 , the 46 - year - old man who confessed to @entity1 ’s murder , said that the scoutmaster sexually abused him as a boy , and said that he ‘ got what was coming to him			1
’ now , months after @entity1 ’s gruesome murder , others have echoed @entity25 ’ complaint of sexual abuse			1
@entity1 was a lifelong resident of @entity27 , @entity9 , and had been active not only in the @entity3 , but many police honor legions , the @entity30 , and historical societies			1
he had also served in the military during the @entity33			0
but while his obituary painted the 68 - year - old as an upstanding citizen , @entity16 ’ affidavit showed @entity1 in a drastically different light			1
@entity16 said in his affidavit that @entity42 ‘ got what was coming to him ’ because he had been ‘ a child molester for years , ’ and had exploited his time as a scoutmaster in the 1970s to get closer to young boys			1
the court records , obtained by the @entity47 , allege that @entity16 went to @entity1 ’s home in @entity27 on the night of june 12 , joined by his friend , @entity49			1
the two men were carrying knives in their vehicle			0
according to the affidavit , the two began stabbing @entity1 as soon as they arrived at his quiet rental home			2
boys turned to men : court records allege that @entity16 ( left ) went to @entity1 ’s home in @entity27 on the night of june 12 , joined by his friend , @entity49 ( right ) chilling photographs from @entity1 ’s entryway show large blood spatters where he was allegedly knifed			1
@entity1 was later found on his living room floor with more than 20 stab wounds to his torso			2
his throat was also slit			0
@entity16 then drove to his mother ’s house in @entity27 and removed his bloodied clothes , hiding the murder weapons in the process , the affidavit stated			1
his mother , @entity73 , tried in vain to get her son to seek medical attention for wounds he had apparently received from the assault , but @entity16 merely took some sleep medication and went to bed , the document said			2
he was charged with first - degree murder			0
@entity49 , 47 , was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being an accomplice			0
both men have pleaded not guilty to the alleged crimes			0
shaming the badge : prior to his death , @entity1 had been involved with the @entity27 , @entity89 , as well as a number of other community organizations and historical societies scene : @entity1 was later found on his living room floor with more than 20 stab wounds to his torso			2
his throat was also slit according to the @entity99 , a source told police that they had seen a box containing pictures of child pornography at @entity1 ’s house in the 1970s			1
authorities retrieved a box of pictures of young boys from @entity1 ’s house , though none were considered to be pornographic			1
@entity1 was never married and had no children			2
‘ the witness described seeing this box roughly 35 years ago , so it ’s not overly surprising we were unable to find it , ’ @entity113 assistant prosecutor @entity112 told the paper			2
there were no files of abuse on @entity1 , a @entity121 spokesperson said			1
@entity1 ’s estate is being overseen by his friend and attorney @entity126 , who told the @entity99 : ‘ i ’d have put my life in his hands			1
i trusted him that much			0
’ mr @entity126 continued : ‘ if it did happen , my heart goes out to the victims			0
but i just find it hard to believe			0
’ the prosecuting attorney over the case speculated in june that the alleged attack was carried out only a day after former @entity139 assistant football coach @entity138 went on trial			0
news of @entity1 ’s murder and of @entity16 ’ abuse allegations come as the @entity3 face close scrutiny for their handling of past molestation claims			1
the files , kept at @entity121 headquarters in @entity149 , consist of memos from local and national scout executives , handwritten letters from victims and their parents and newspaper clippings about legal cases			0
the documents contain details about proven molesters , but also unsubstantiated allegations			0
the allegations stretch across the country and to military bases overseas , from a small town in the @entity165 to downtown @entity166			0
in some cases , local law enforcement did nothing - despite a confession - seeking to protect the name of scouting over their victims			0
boxed files containing witness accounts , complaints , and unresolved allegations of sexual abuse in the @entity3 were released in october			1
they contain cases collected between 1959 and 1985 , with a handful of others from later years			2
the files also document other troubling patterns			0
there is little mention in the files of concern for the welfare of @entity3 who were abused by their leaders , or what was done for the victims			2
but there are numerous documents showing compassion for alleged abusers , who were often times sent to psychiatrists or pastors to get help			0
in numerous instances , alleged abusers are kicked out of scouting but show up in jobs where they are once again in authority positions dealing with youths			0
the files also show scouting volunteers serving in the military overseas , molesting @entity212 children living abroad and sometimes continuing to molest after returning to the states			0
but one of the most startling revelations to come from the files is the frequency with which attempts to protect @entity3 from molesters collapsed at the local level , at times in collusion with community leaders			2
chilling : boxed files containing witness accounts , complaints , and unresolved allegations of sexual abuse in the @entity3 were released in october spanning more than two decades			1

@entity1 , a former scoutmaster , was found murdered in his home in june
former boy scout @entity16 confessed to @entity1 ’s murder , saying he ' got what was coming to him ' for being ' a child molester for years '
comes after @entity3 released *hundreds* of abuse files from 1959 to 1985
