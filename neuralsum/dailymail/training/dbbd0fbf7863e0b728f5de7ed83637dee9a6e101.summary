by @entity0 hi everyone ! ! i 've decided to do something a little bit different for my blog this week			1
before i left for @entity6 i tested out a few home treatment machines and these are a few of my favourites			1
as you all know i love a salon beauty treatment but there 's also nothing like having a few mean machines to use at home			1
i have a special guest in this week 's @entity18 video ! @entity19 came along and also gave her opinion on one of her most loved home treatment machines			1
bend the plastic bud and insert into the machine			1
to pick your preferred treatment press the program button , you can choose between toning and wrinkles			1
it will flash once it ’s on your chosen treatment			1
next choose the treatment intensity clicking the mode button you can choose low , medium or high			1
again it will flash once it ’s on your chosen intensity level			1
the @entity54 can help with toning your skin whilst reducing wrinkles if you are doing the toning treatment the machine needs to be in the open position			1
if you are doing the wrinkle treatment the machine need to locked closed			1
now you 've done that click the start button and off you go			1
with the wrinkle treatment you use the eraser method			1
it ’s basically a zig - zag motion			1
you can do this technique on your forehead , eyes , middlebrow , cheeks , upper lip , chin , jawline and neck			1
each pass should last around 30 seconds			1
you know to move on to another treatment section when the beeps speed up			1
with the toning treatment you use the pinching method			1
you pinch the area you wish to treat ensuring not clasp to hard and hold for six seconds			2
you should do each section twice			2
again you will know when to move on to another treatment section when the beeps speed up			1
you should do this on your jaw line , cheeks , brows , middle brow and by the corner of you eye where you may see crows feet			2
why i love it : it ’s like a face work out ! you have to work out your face muscles like you do in the gym with your body – it helps keep your face plump and firm			2
it ’s also great for stimulating collagen and energizing the skin , this is one for all ages			2
@entity19 says that this has worked wonders for her ! the @entity34 costs £ 349.00 and is available at : @entity111 @entity112 how it works : before use ensure your skin is fully cleansed and dry – it is important to ensure your skin is dry or the disk wo n’t glide smoothly			2
this machine is very easy to operate you simply connect the power cord and turn it on			2
firstly test it on the back of your hand with the white disk to get use to the feeling			2
( your machine will come to you with the white disk already attached )			2
the white disk is for testing and your first initial treatments			1
the @entity112 is great for reviving dry skin it is best to use the white disk first and once you have got used to the feeling and how your skin reacts to the treatment , you can progress to the other disks			1
the blue disks are for sensitive skin and the green for medium abrasion			2
smaller disks are for use on the face and larger ones for use on your body			2
once you are happy with the feel you are ready for the treatment			1
pull your skin taught and glide over never do more the two passes over the same area			2
once you have finished your treatment follow up with a neutralizing toner to restore your skin ’s ph and then moisturize			1
why i love it : after using the @entity112 for a couple of weeks i noticed my skin was glowing , blemishes had completely disappeared and my skin felt very soft			2
the machine comes with an instruction cd and after having a look i felt like a pro ! this is very easy to use , and i can definitely say it is worth the money			2
the @entity112 costs £ 150 and can be purchased from @entity166 and @entity167 @entity168 & body how it works : before use , ensure your chosen treatment area is shaved , clean and dry			1
use skin tone sensor to check your skin is suitable for use			2
if your skin is treatable your machine will bleep and switch on			2
next you choose your desired energy level there are five , you can choose the level that is most comfortable for you			0
@entity0 says the @entity180 is perfect for de-fuzzing place over your chosen treatment area at right angles and press the flash button to activate			1
for large areas , hold the flash button for constant flashes every two seconds			0
this machine can be used on your arms , legs , bikini line and underarms			0
there is also a separate head to enable you to use it on your face below your cheekbones			0
after three treatments you should see permanent results			1
why i love it : this is the perfect de-fuzzing tool			1
its painless and the results are amazing			0
after using this machine around three to four times i started to notice that i did not have to shave as much			0
any hairs that grow back were very fine and could easily go unnoticed			0
using the @entity180 will save you many an expensive trip to the salon			0
the @entity180 costs 324.99 and is available at www.remington.co.uk and @entity212			0
@entity213 how it works : manually cleanse your skin before use , i personally use @entity218			0
to start apply a cleanser to either a damp brush or your skin and simply press start on your @entity222 the machine in a circular motion to cleanse			0
the @entity213 has three levels of speed , low , medium and high			0
each speed offers a deeper level of cleansing			0
to change the speed , click the up and down buttons on the machine			0
the @entity213 offers an excellent facial cleanse for the perfect cleanse each @entity213 is in built with a timer , which guides you through four sections of your face			0
it beeps letting you know when to move on to a different section of your face			0
the @entity213 ’s factory setting timer is set for a 1 minute cycle which allows 10 seconds on each cheek , 20 seconds for your forehead and 20 seconds on the middle of your face ( nose and chin )			0
for a longer cycle you can change to a two - minute cycle by pressing and holding the up button whilst the machine is off			0
why i love it : the @entity213 is a great machine to use day and night as part of your beauty regime			0
the bristles are quite soft but effective , it feels like a toothbrush on the skin			0
i love the extra glow that comes with using the machine for a prolonged period of time			0
the @entity213 costs £ 155 and is available at @entity267 on another note , as it 's @entity268 on @entity269 i thought i 'd share with you some other products i ’ve been loving of late			1
i ’ve been reaching for them non-stop since i ’ve arrived in the @entity273 , so thought it was time to let you guys in on the secret , too ! these are @entity0 's @entity278 pharmacy favourites @entity279 30 @entity281 creams are a recent beauty invention : @entity281 stands for @entity283 , and these fabulous formulas work to combat skincare issues while also acting as a lightweight make - up base			1

the silky formula is enriched with @entity290 and naturally derived @entity291 , which helps to neutralise long - term redness			0
refreshing and non-oily , the cream glides over the skin without leaving any streaks for a truly natural - looking finish			0
@entity298 beauty lovers have gone wild for this heavenly fragrance , and i have joined their ranks in declaring it the scent of the season			0
