@entity0 realised - to his horror - that his daily , social drinking was putting him at increased risk of alcohol - related liver disease			1
he is now trying to have two consecutive ' dry ' days each week hello my name is @entity0 , and i 'm the sort of guy who could die from liver disease			1
i 'm not an alcoholic : the seldom - seen - anymore friend fishing on @entity13 to be congratulated on his dry anniversary			1
i 'm not the divorcé at your work who lurches back from lunch with a mouthful of @entity20 , and gets called into the boss 's office the morning after the @entity23			2
nor the guy on your bus this morning with an open can of electric soup , chemical bo and no particular place to go ( why do these folks never have a lie - in ? )			2
no , i 'm none of those people			2
but i am the sort of guy who could die from liver disease			1
and possibly so are you			0
the reason ? i just love a drink			0
i do n't self - medicate or blot out , i drink to enhance life			2
i scoff at talk like ' i do n't like the taste ' or ' it 's empty calories '			0
i love that thirst - shattering beer at the end of the working day , the flavoursome explosion of a glass of red with a meal , the bite of a fine dark rum sipped while contemplating a knotty problem			1
alcohol is n't a crutch for me , it 's a pogo stick			2
i suppose some might take issue with my phrase ' a drink '			0
a few years ago at an office drinks do i was , er , ' refreshing my glass ' when a lippy young intern remarked : ' hoovering up are we @entity63 ? ' lest anyone think that gross impertinence is a career impediment at @entity67 , i should point out that he is now our associate style editor			0
but that phrase made me realise i could slip into a dangerous category identified by @entity70 , chief executive of the @entity71 , as he surveys the – ironically sobering – statistic of a 25 per cent rise in alcohol - related liver disease deaths in the last decade			1
' at the moment liver disease is the 5th biggest killer in the @entity77			1
if we do n't do anything about it by 2025 it will almost certainly be one of the top two , it is a major epidemic			2
' the majority of people who die of alcohol - related liver disease are not alcoholics			1
they drink every day or most days - not getting slaughtered , but just drinking that bit too much			1
just topping up every day and never giving their liver a rest			1
' does that make them alcoholics , heavy drinkers , chronic drinkers or just normal ? we can sit here and split hairs all day , but ultimately my opinion , your opinion , even the finger - wagging of your gp does n't matter			1
they are not categories your liver recognises			2
it does n't care whether you necked those five pints with a crowd of mates to wet a baby 's head , or whether you drank them alone to numb the pain of an argument			0
it 's not about judgements , just biology			0
and liver disease can develop slowly , but its endgame can be apocalyptic			1
it 's not a question of lying in hospital with yellow skin and a glorified tummy ache			0
besides its function of filtering out the toxins from drink and drugs , the organ is also vital for hormone balance , blood clotting , and protecting certain parts of the body from infection			0
remove its protection , and things will start going to shit very rapidly			0
believe me , you do n't want to see what happens to brain function when the liver can no longer dispose of bilirubin , a by - product of dead blood cells			1
there are other culprits when it comes to liver disease : obesity is a factor , as is the prevalence of viral hepatitis and , to some little extent , steroid abuse			1
but booze is drawing most fire for the moment			0
' in the last 35 years we 've allowed alcohol to become a commodity , ' says mr @entity70			2
your liver is the size of : a. an iphone b. a grapefruit c. a rugby ball answer : c - a rugby ball it is surprisingly large			1
it 's the second largest organ ( after your skin ) weighs 1.3kg and at any one time will contain 10 per cent of the blood in your body which of the following is an early sign of liver disease ? a. an aching liver b. floating faeces c. @entity194 urine answer : @entity197 - floating faeces and dark urine ' the liver does n't have any nerve endings so if it gets damaged there wo n't be any be any pain , ' says @entity70 , of the @entity71			1
' if your urine is darker on a regular basis , even when you 're hydrated , or if you regularly have floating poo , that can be a sign your liver is n't absorbing fat			2
' true or false : fatty liver disease is incurable false			1
the liver is a resilient organ , and fatty liver disease , which can be diagnosed with a blood test , is reversible with two weeks ' abstinence			1
watch your step though , move onto either of the next two steps of @entity220 , alcoholic patitis or cirrhosis , and you will have to give up alcohol permanently to save your life			1
' in the 70s it would have been fairly unusual for my mum to have had alcohol in her shopping , whereas now a bottle of wine goes into the basket along with the milk , eggs and bread			1
' you can see how it works			0
not so many years ago , drinkers comprised discrete guilds			0
some people propped up the saloon bar , others drank wine or spirits at home , purchased by the single bottle			1
now we can enjoy back - to - back football in pubs that once shut on sunday afternoons before heading home to tuck into that wine club case of mixed reds ( a product perfectly balanced in the middle - class chasm between aspiration and fear – we talk eruditely about @entity259 grape varieties while worrying about how quickly that rack is emptying itself )			1
the article appears in this month 's issue of @entity67 , on sale now our any time , any place , anywhere attitude to booze puts everyone at risk			0
so what is our strategy			0
assuming that complete abstinence is out , you could try a month off – a dry january for example			2
mr @entity70 welcomes this with some qualification			0
' anything that gets people to look at their drinking is a good idea , ' he says			2
' but you 're wasting your time if you go back to old habits for the other 11 months			0
' @entity70 has a simple prescription : ' if you are going to drink , you must take two to three consecutive days off every week to give your liver a chance to rejuvenate – regardless of how much you 're drinking , ' he says			1
' the important word here is ' consecutive '			2
it needs at least 48 hours to start repairing itself			0
' to this end the @entity71 has just brought out an app , @entity293 , which helps you stick to your dry days			1
the @entity295 recently exhibited a rare example of a @entity298 propaganda poster which made sense			0
' do n't take alcoholic drinks on mondays ' , it exhorted , a gesture of solidarity with ' the great sacrifices freely made by our sailors and soldiers '			0
i 'm going to go one better , and stick to grapefruit juice on mondays and tuesdays , in solidarity with a truly long - suffering organ			0
after all , we 've all been putting this guy through a lot			0
care to join me ? thanks to the @entity71			0
go to ( www.loveyourliver.org.uk ) the link for the @entity293 app : @entity316			0

liver disease is the fifth leading cause of death in men
@entity0 is trying to have two consecutive dry days each week
has been a 25 *%* rise in alcohol - related liver disease deaths in last decade
instead of one wine or a beer after work , many of us now have two or three
experts : ' these people just top up every day and never give liver a rest '
