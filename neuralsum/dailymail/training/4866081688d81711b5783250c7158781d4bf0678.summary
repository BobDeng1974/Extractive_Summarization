by @entity0 in such a data - rich world , it ’s often a struggle to wade through the numbers and work out what they are telling us - especially when it comes to @entity8			1
but two researchers have tried their best to crack this problem after spending two years trying to map the capital ’s social and political dividing lines			0
the @entity15 professors have used size - based maps to bring to life statistics as diverse as the rise in bankers and the fall in hedgehogs			1
distribution : this map shows where bankers tend to live within @entity8 , with a large number around @entity27 and in @entity28 and @entity29 hedgehogs : there were 1,272 sightings of them in @entity34 - upon - @entity35 last year , but none in the @entity37 and only five in @entity28 and @entity29 shapes and sizes : these maps show the increases in the value of housing in @entity44 last year , compared to what was sold in 2012 - with a huge rise in @entity8 @entity47 and @entity48 have made 300 maps for the @entity51 project , two more of which show unemployment and air pollution			1
and there are huge gaps , such as the life expectancy difference between @entity57 and the @entity58 being the same as @entity44 and @entity60			0
their graphics are distorted according to the numbers - so higher house prices in @entity65 than @entity66 will mean that area is far more stretched out			1
the hedgehogs map shows @entity8 boroughs resized according to recorded sightings by the @entity72 group			2
capital gains : this reference map shows all the boroughs of @entity8 with their individual colours given by the @entity15 researchers diversity : this map shows net household weekly income in the capital after tax , based on ward - level estimates , with the higher values in darker colours educational achievement : this is the capped gcse point score for pupils across @entity8 in 2010 , with blue and green representing the highest levels there were 1,272 sightings of them in @entity34 - upon - @entity35 last year , but none in the @entity37 and only five in @entity28 and @entity29			1
other animal sightings which have been mapped by the researchers include peregrine falcons , stag beetles , muntjac deer , reported @entity100			0
professor @entity47 told the newspaper : ‘ these maps are like fancy pie charts , and if something is twice the size of something else it is obvious			2
‘ we probably have more quality data [ on @entity8 ] than anywhere else			0
that 's partly because the @entity112 are obsessed with collecting numbers			0
’ children in poverty : this map shows the percentage of dependent children receiving child tax - credit and in out - of - work families			0
@entity121 and orange are the worst areas ages : this life expectancy graphic shows how things are much better for people living in @entity28 and @entity29 ( over 82 ) , while it can be less than 77 in @entity8 the map of property prices shows an enormous increase in @entity8 between 2012 and last year , compared to other areas of @entity44 and @entity132			1
this was over a period when the total value of housing in @entity28 and @entity29 jumped by £ 1billion , and in @entity65 by £ 921million			1
another interesting figure was the number of @entity139 in parts of @entity8 – 54,000 just in @entity141 , but only 9,000 south of the @entity35			0
and a map which shows where bankers tend to live within @entity8 , with a large number around @entity27 and in @entity28 and @entity29			0
professor @entity47 added : ‘ there is an incredible increase in capacity to understand abstract concepts , images and maps , generation by generation			2

graphics distorted according to numbers , so higher house prices in @entity65 means that area is stretched out
@entity51 project by @entity15 professors @entity47 and @entity48 formed of 300 maps
1,272 sightings of hedgehogs in @entity34 - upon - @entity35 last year - but none in @entity37 and only five in @entity28
