when @entity2 's 30 - year - old daughter @entity3 was killed fighting @entity5 jihadis near @entity6 in @entity7 , she was left heartbroken			1
now ms @entity2 , 55 , a veteran of battles against a vengeful @entity9 during the 1970s , plans to take revenge - by returning to the front line to massacre the terrorists herself			1
' they are dirt , ' she spits furiously			2
' they are the dirtiest people in the world , especially for those of us who are women			0
heartbroken : @entity2 and @entity20 with a picture of their daughter , captain @entity24 killed : ms @entity26 ( centre ) , a mother - of - one , was killed during heavy fighting outside the town of @entity30 ' if they take you they will kill you or rape you or sell you or do anything they want			1
breaking you is their business			0
they are the dirtiest people			0
' like her husband @entity20 , also 55 , ms @entity2 is a colonel in the @entity42 armed forces or peshmerga as they are more commonly known			1
based close to the town of @entity30 in northern @entity7 's @entity46 , both are part of the battle against @entity50 jihadis , although in different battalions and on different parts of the front line			1
their daughter @entity3 , a captain in the 2nd @entity55 and the mother of a seven - year - old son , was , they say , was an accomplished fighter			1
' i 'm proud of every single thing she ever did and i have so many good memories of her , ' adds her sobbing mother			1
' she never did anything that i could n't be proud of			0
to me , she 's not a martyr			0
she 's alive and she 's going to stay with me for ever			0
' devastated : mr @entity20 shows off a badge emblazoned with a photo of the daughter of whom he was ' so proud ' vengeance : ms @entity71 , a veteran fighter , has vowed to return to the frontline to get her revenge on is talented : according to her parents , ms @entity74 was enormously talented and wanted to become a politician proud : mr @entity20 says he taught his daughter to fight for her country 's freedom from an early age @entity3 , the first woman from the @entity7 - @entity42 peshmerga to be killed , died after a mortar exploded near her position during heavy fighting , leaving her body riddled with shrapnel			1
her mother was fighting alongside her at the time			1
' i started teaching her to shoot when she was 11 , ' she smiles through her tears			0
' she learned with me , her mother			1
and when she was killed , she was with me , her mother , as well			1
we were on the front line and they were shooting at us			0
' mr @entity20 , also a veteran fighter , was with his battalion further down the front line when news of his daughter 's death arrived			1
' the day my daughter was injured , my wife was there with her on the front line , ' he remembers			1
' i was further down in a place called @entity106 , which is also on the front line			0
i got a message to say that my daughter had been injured			2
' critically wounded , @entity3 died 10 days later in hospital			0
now her parents are returning to the front line - and have vowed to kill as many is jihadis as they can before they are killed themselves			1
' from the day of the first is attack , we knew about the possibility that we might have to die for our country , ' explains mr @entity20			1
' that is why we chose to be peshmerga			2
the word peshmerga means " face of death "			2
being a peshmerga means you have to face up to death			2
that is why we chose to be peshmerga			2
' we want to get freedom for our own country			0
if we had n't chosen that , my daughter would n't have been killed			1
but it is what is right			0
' women have long fought as frontline troops with the peshmerga which was , until recently , one of the few military organisations to allow it			1
in @entity141 , men were , until earlier this year , the only ones allowed frontline combat roles although women can and do play an important part in all three services			2
despite the loss of his daughter , mr @entity20 says the peshmerga 's stance on female fighters is the correct one			1
' i believe in equality from day one , ' he explains			0
' i do n't see any difference between men and women on the frontline			2
i respected my daughter 's ability			2
hard work : ms @entity74 , far right , had recently been promoted to captain thanks to her exceptional fighting skills sad : ms @entity74 's commander , colonel @entity163 , says she is heartbroken at the loss of her friend ' when we trained together , they asked us to hit targets [ in a firing range ]			1
i could n't do it but my daughter hit it every time			2
' always , there has been equality between us			0
any woman can be as good with weapons as a man			0
my daughter could have been any @entity42 person 's daughter			1
' the peshmerga , who are being supported from the air by @entity141 planes , have enjoyed some success in recent weeks and are pushing the jihadists back towards @entity186			2
a small , all - male , detachment have also travelled to @entity189 to join the fight against is in @entity191 , the @entity193 border town that has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days			1
nevertheless , the fighting in northern @entity7 remains intense , with ms @entity2 saying that the former @entity198 party men who have flocked to join is in the north are making the situation ever more dangerous			1
' the is people are all ex @entity202 guys , ' she sniffs scornfully			0
' the governor of @entity186 is @entity9 's nephew			0
most of them are @entity206			0
' tough : the peshmerga has long put its female fighters in frontline combat roles , including against is dangerous job : after months of heavy fighting , the peshmerga have begun to push is back towards @entity186 despite the couple 's defiance , they admit that they have been left heartbroken by the death of their daughter and say the only thing left for them to do is avenge her death			1
' i taught her from childhood to take care of @entity227 and work for independence , ' adds her father			0
' her whole family have been revolutionaries and my grandfather , my brother , my uncle and my cousins were all killed fighting for our country			1
' i did n't teach her any other thing - only that			2
she died for freedom and independence			0
' but , he adds , the current battle is not about politics			0
instead , it 's about ending the scourge of @entity50			1
' we have no ideology , ' he says			0
' we just want to fight the terrorists			0
we fight to finish the terror			0
' and if that means risking death , then , says ms @entity2 , so be it			1
' from the day we become peshmerga , we put our souls in our hands , ' she explains			2
' any day , our souls can , like a bird , fly away			0
we are the face of death - we are peshmerga			1
we go to fight , we go to fight @entity50			1
' of course you might get killed			2
of course you will kill someone else			0
that is how it is			0
