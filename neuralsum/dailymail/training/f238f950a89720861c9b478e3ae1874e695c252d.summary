@entity1 candidate @entity0 has been suspended after saying the jobless should n't drive a @entity1 general election candidate has been suspended after he said benefits claimants should be banned from driving to cut traffic - and take the bus to job interviews instead			1
the policy , which was swiftly disowned by the party , was in a flyer boasting ' common sense solutions ' sent out by a 64 - year - old county councillor in @entity13			1
@entity0 claimed it would remove 6million cars from the roads - adding he 'd cut traffic further by forcing cyclists back onto the pavement			1
the leaflet faced widespread scorn within minutes of appearing on @entity22 and has prompted an investigation by party bosses			0
mr @entity0 has now been suspended from his post as @entity1 's general election candidate for the seat of @entity28			1
a party spokesman said : ' @entity0 ' views do not represent @entity1 policy			1
he has apologised for any offence caused and was today suspended as a candidate			1
' the spokesman would not confirm whether the suspension was temporary or permanent			2
he remained a member of the party and a councillor today			1
the leaflet boasted : ' we could likely remove six million cars from the road if benefit claimants were not driving			0
' why do they have the privilege to spend the taxpayers ' hard - earned money on a car , when those in work are struggling to keep their own car on the road ? ' these people could really catch a bus ! ' yet again we 're proposing common sense policies and common sense solutions '			1
his leaflet added : ' as much as i applaud cycling as a form of exercise and past - time [ sic ] the already congested roads can not cope with both bus lanes and cyclists			2
' cycles should go back to the pavements yet give priority to pedestrians			0
' former @entity69 mr @entity0 became a @entity13 councillor in 1989 and now serves on the council 's transport committee			1
he was due to fight the @entity13 seat of @entity28 at the general election in may - where the current mp is former @entity78 minister @entity77 , who has been in the @entity79 since 1979			1
mr @entity77 is standing down as an mp to become a health policy adviser for accountants @entity81			0
ridicule : this photograph of the leaflet circulated widely on @entity22 , where users ridiculed the ' policies ' @entity88 health minister @entity87 said the @entity90 party was now ' beyond a joke '			0
@entity92 mp mr @entity87 said : ' it 's beyond a joke now			0
not so much a political party but a stag night out of control			0
' the councillor raised a similar issue during a meeting last month in which he tried to stop cycle lanes being built			0
' you 're like lemmings when it comes to what central government tells you , ' he said			0
' they can be wrong			0
@entity107 got it wrong telling cyclists to come off the payment			0
' but his comments were disowned today by his only @entity1 colleague in @entity13 @entity113 , who tweeted : ' the views expressed by @entity0 are his own and do not reflect my or @entity1 's policy '			1
elsewhere in the leaflet mr @entity0 said he personally believed rapists and child sex offenders should be chemically castrated			2
he also said he believed all prisoners should have their possessions confiscated and sent to serve their sentences abroad - though how this would save money was unclear			2
opinions : the full leaflet by mr @entity0 , which said prisoners should be sent to serve their sentences overseas campaign : the reverse side of the open letter said @entity132 will ' never , never ' give an @entity134 referendum ' prisoners cost the taxpayer upwards of Â£ 45,000 per annum @entity137 , ' he wrote			1
' any assets of convicted criminals , for example homes , cars , savings , etc , should be confiscated to help pay for their sentence			0
' i personally would look to overseas countries who could tender for their incarceration			0
i 'm sure they could dramatically reduce this cost to the taxpayer			0
' his @entity92 opponent for the @entity28 seat , @entity155 , said : ' it is a sad indictment of a political party that is aiming to have a say in how this country is governed that he should state something so inane , not thought through , and frankly depressing in its vindictive simplicity			2
' but @entity163 , the @entity92 group leader on @entity164 , claimed mr @entity0 had previously suggested cutting back bus funding because many passengers were benefits claimants			2
' he 's not mad ' , said mr @entity163			0
' there are a lot of people who say things like that in bar rooms			0
plenty of people think like that and they 're @entity1 supporters			2
' when asked if he agreed with the leaflet , mr @entity163 said : ' of course not '			0
a @entity1 spokesman said last night the suggestions were ' not @entity1 policies and they will not form part of the @entity1 manifesto			1
' views : mr @entity0 during a meeting last month in which he said funding for cycle lanes should be restricted gaffes : party leader @entity189 has had to deal with a series of out - of - turn comments by his own members			1
he personally suggested immigrants might be to blame for congestion on the @entity195 this morning the councillor remained in the party and in his county council job			2
the party 's spokesman told @entity201 : ' there 's no doubt he 's been a bit of an idiot but it 's of a different value to racism or things of that sort			1
' we ca n't chuck somebody out even for abject racism in 24 hours			0
we have to go through due process			0
' there will be discussions made and decisions taken as with anything but he is still a member of the party '			0
mr @entity0 did not return requests for comment			2
this week @entity1 was forced to deny claims its policy chief had been sacked amid fears the party 's general election manifesto would not be ready in time for the spring conference in march			1
@entity229 left his post with just months to go before the biggest campaign in the party 's history , but @entity1 candidates still have little they are able to say on the doorstep			1
that led @entity22 users to fill the gap by suggesting their own @entity1 policies - including a price cut for mustard - coloured corduroy trousers and renaming @entity243 ' @entity242 '			1
many of the supposed policies referenced @entity1 's string of gaffes			1
one councillor said last winter 's floods were @entity251 's punishment for the legalisation of gay marriage , while party leader @entity189 appeared to blame immigrants for congestion on the @entity195 .			2
