at one point , he smacks his head into a glass window several times			0
@entity10 and brother @entity17 were later released from jail			1
the video was taken several hours after @entity2 , @entity2 and @entity2 were found alive in @entity2 's home on @entity21 in @entity3			1
they had been held captive for a decade in @entity2 's home on @entity21 in @entity3			1

@entity2 looks on calmly ( far left ) for more videos , please go to @entity9 @entity2 stands stoically between his two brothers during the booking			1
the video emerged as the brothers gave their first interview since the girls were discovered			1
the brothers spoke of how they had no idea why they were being arrested			2
they also revealed that prior to the arrests , they had seen the daughter that @entity2 fathered with @entity2 during her captivity			1
on two different occasions they saw @entity44 bring the young girl to fast food restaurants - one time at @entity47 and another at @entity48			1
each time , he said that the girl was his girlfriend 's daughter			2
@entity10 was in the car with his brother @entity2 when police pulled them over in a @entity47 parking lot and his first thought was that @entity2 had run a red light			1
@entity17 was woken up at his home by police , and he thought that they were arresting him for an outstanding open container warrant			1
they were both far off base , as they only learned when they arrived at the police station and were questioned separately about the three young women that @entity2 had secretly kept in his house			1
@entity17 said that once at the station , he asked what he was being charged with and a police officer wrote the word ' kidnapping ' down on a piece of paper and handed it to him			2
' i did n't have my reading glasses , i looked and i said , " oh , open containers			0
" she said @entity92 , read it again			0
" and i said " oh ! kidnapping ! what 's this ? kidnapping ? i 'm thinking kidnapping			2
who did i kidnap ? " ' he told @entity73			0
@entity17 was similarly confused , and the only one to have a clue of what was going on was @entity2 , who remains behind bars after his bail was set at $ 8million			1
' he goes " @entity10 , i 'm sorry			2
you did n't know nothing about this , @entity10			2
i 'm sorry , @entity10			2
" and that was it			0
and then that 's when i broke down on my way over there			0
@entity112 said , " what did my brother do ? what did he do ? " ' @entity10 told @entity73			2
set up : @entity10 ( seen at his arrest at left and during the interview at right ) was with his brother @entity2 when police pulled them over in a @entity47 parking lot , and he said that maybe @entity2 wanted to be caught ' when he walked past me , he goes , " @entity10 , you 're never going to see me again			1
" and that was it			0
and he put his fist up for a bump			0
' they consider their brother to be a ' monster ' and said that one of the worst moments for them came when they realized that @entity2 was one of the kidnapping victims since they are friends with her father , @entity138			1
' i knew him for a long time and when i found out that @entity140 had @entity141 , i just broke down its just shocking			0
@entity2 , we know this guy for a long time and you got his daughter and you go round like nothing , you even went to the vigils , you had posters , you give his mama a hug and you got his daughters captive ? ' @entity17 said in disbelief in the interview that aired monday morning			1
@entity17 told of how one time he saw @entity44 bring a young girl to the local @entity47 - the girl that is now known to be @entity157 who the 52 - year - old fathered with his kidnapping victim @entity2			1
' i seen @entity2 with a little girl at @entity47 and i asked him who 's that and he said " this is a girlfriend 's of mine , " ' @entity17 told @entity73			1
in the dark : @entity17 described how on the few occasions they went to their brother @entity2 's house , he would keep them in the kitchen or outside on the steps when he saw the same young girl at @entity48 with @entity44 on a different occasion , he asked where the mother was but @entity2 just said she was busy			1
the brothers said that they had no inkling about the years of abuse that went on at their brother 's house because they never had a thorough tour of his home on @entity21			2
on the rare occasions that they did visit his home , they stayed in the kitchen and could not see into the other areas because @entity2 had put up curtains blocking the other rooms			2
he explained that it was a energy saving technique			0
' the reason why we would go in the kitchen , because he had alcohol			0
and he would take me in the kitchen , give me a shot , ' @entity17 said			0
signs : in a photograph taken in 2001 , suspect @entity2 stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door , which led to the basement , at his home on @entity208 , @entity3 ' @entity209 ' : @entity210 and his father stand in front of the door to the basement in 2001 other ways that he would keep his guests from suspecting any criminal activity was to constantly have a radio or tv on so that it would drown out any background noise , and they would never spend much time actually indoors , opting to eat out on the steps instead			2
the brothers , who were arrested along with @entity2 but later released due to a lack of evidence , say that since their release from prison , they have been faced with online death threats , a break - in at one of their homes , and vandalism			1
busted : @entity2 is facing kidnapping and rape charges , and his brothers say they would have turned him in sooner had they known when asked by @entity73 reporter @entity72 if the public would always suspect they had a role in the kidnappings , they answered ' yes ' in unison			1
@entity10 said : ' the people out there who know me , they know that @entity10 is not that person , has nothing to do with that - would never even think of something like that			2
i was a very liked person [ before the arrest ] , never had any enemies			0
' [ there is ] no reason for anybody to think that i would ever do something like that			0
it was a shock to all my friends			0
they could n’t believe it			0
' @entity17 added : ' i could n’t never think of doing anything like that			0
if i knew that my brother was doing this , in a minute i would have called the cops ; cause that ai n’t right			0
but yeah , it ’s going to haunt me down			0
cause people are going to think @entity17 had something to do with this and pedro do n’t have anything to do this			0
they said that even though @entity2 is their brother , they would have had no choice but to turn him in - had they known			1
' if i knew , i would have reported it , brother or no brother			0
