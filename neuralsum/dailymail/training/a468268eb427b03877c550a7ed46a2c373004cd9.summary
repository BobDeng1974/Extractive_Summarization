@entity0 feels @entity2 team - mate @entity1 was handed ' another gift ' after a qualifying crash again put the @entity5 on the back foot in this year 's @entity8 title fight			1
@entity0 suffered a failure of the front - right brake disk during the initial session for the @entity13 @entity12 at @entity14			1
on approach to the left - handed loop inside the stadium complex , the failure immediately pitched @entity0 into a high - speed spin across a gravel trap , with his momentum halted by a 30g shunt into a tyre barrier			2
unsurprisingly winded , @entity0 was at least able to radio back to his team , pointing out : ' i put my foot on the pedal and something failed			0
' crash : @entity0 's hopes of winning the @entity13 gp have been scuppered after his qualifying crash in the barriers : @entity0 suffered a brake failure , leaving team - mate @entity1 to secure pole @entity0 eventually clambered from the cockpit of his car , raising his right hand to acknowledge he was okay , before heading off to the medical centre for a medical inspection which is routine procedure following such a crash			1
the 29 - year - old will now start 15th , moving up one place from his qualifying position of 16th due to @entity46 serving a three - place grid penalty			2
to rub salt into @entity0 's wounds , @entity1 unsurprisingly went on to claim his fourth pole from the last five grands prix , and ninth of his @entity54 career			1
not for the first time this season @entity0 faces another exercise in damage limitation to ensure the current four - point gap between the duo does not become too excessive again			0
dejection : @entity0 will start only 15th for sunday 's @entity13 @entity12 scene of the accident : the @entity2 man lost control of his car after he suffered a brake problem reflecting on his accident , @entity0 said : ' i 'm in a little bit of pain , but that 's what happens when you have a crash like that			1
even if something is broken i will still be racing on sunday			0
' i think ( the team ) said i pulled something like 30g , but you never enter a corner thinking something will happen			0
' @entity1 has now basically got another gift ( with pole ) , but we will see what we can do			0
' @entity0 and @entity1 use different manufacturers for their brakes as it comes down to feel rather than a team dictating what a driver should have on the car , with the @entity92 and the latter using @entity94			2
out in front : @entity1 will start on pole ahead of the @entity98 duo of @entity99 ( right ) and @entity100 @entity0 's brakes were also new going into final practice earlier on saturday , but whatever the circumstances , this is the latest qualifying blow to a man renowned for his speed over one lap. for @entity1 , this result continues his great week after getting married , watching @entity13 win the @entity109 and signing a new long - term contract			1
' things have been going really well , and to be at my home race and to get pole is fantastic , ' said @entity1			0
sparing a thought at least for @entity0 , he added : ' i would have preferred an open fight with @entity0 , so i 'm a little bit less happy he did n't have a shot at it at the end			0

@entity0 suffered brake failure in opening session and crashed at *165mph*
@entity5 believes @entity1 , who claimed pole , has been handed ' another @entity126
@entity0 will start only 15th for *tomorrow* 's grand prix at @entity14
@entity1 four points ahead of @entity0 in @entity132 battle
