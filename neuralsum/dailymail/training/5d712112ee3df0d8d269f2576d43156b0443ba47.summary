a statement released by the corporation yesterday claimed that @entity28 had ' decided that she is not in a position to undertake ' her role until the results of the review			2
but it is understood that mr @entity19 ‘ suggested ’ the course of action to @entity28 and both she and mr @entity16 reportedly believed they were able to continue their jobs while the @entity36 is carried out			1
@entity39 , the @entity3 's business editor , revealed in his blog yesterday that ' lawyers acting for ms @entity1 and mr @entity16 have informed mr @entity19 that they are quite capable of running @entity42 , even with the uncertainty created by the @entity24 inquiry '			1

the timing of yesterday ’s announcement suggested that @entity28 and mr @entity16 were being blamed for the appalling failures of @entity63 , which wrongly claimed on november 2 that a senior @entity64 was complicit in child abuse			1
in fact , both executives had played no part in the decision to screen the film , because they had been told to steer clear of any ‘ @entity72 - related ’ stories			2
developments : @entity42 director @entity1 ( l ) and her deputy @entity16 ( r ) have ' stepped aside ' together : @entity15 and @entity1 are pictured at the @entity75 in @entity76 in december 2006 sources say this resulted in a power vacuum at the top of @entity42 , which may have contributed to the decision to broadcast the @entity63 report without even asking the @entity64 in question , @entity84 , about the story			1
the @entity3 claims that removing @entity28 and mr @entity16 will solve this problem – but was forced to make it ‘ absolutely clear ’ that the pair had nothing to do with the @entity90 story			1
although it did not name the @entity64 peer , the report provided enough clues to prompt a wave of wholly untrue allegations about @entity84 on social networking sites			2
under fire : @entity98 , chairman of the @entity99 , speaks to the media in central @entity76 on sunday the @entity3 said the executives were moving aside to resolve the ‘ lack of clarity ’ about who is in charge of @entity42 while mr @entity24 ’s review continues			1

the statement said : ‘ the @entity3 wants to make it absolutely clear that neither @entity1 nor @entity16 had anything at all to do with the failed @entity63 investigation into @entity84			1
’ however , it added there was a ‘ a lack of clarity in the lines of command and control ’ at @entity42 due to the executives ‘ caught up in the @entity36 ’			1
it continued : ‘ in the circumstances @entity1 and @entity16 will be stepping aside from their normal roles until the @entity36 reports and they expect then to return to their positions			1

the newspaper praised today for remaining ' required listening ' but said mr @entity161 was ' dogged by criticism that the show is too male '			0
it is known that she told mr @entity55 – then running @entity203 – at an awards lunch last year that @entity63 was planning to run a report about claims that @entity15 abused young girls , which could affect mr @entity55 ’s plans for @entity210 shows paying tribute to the presenter			1
