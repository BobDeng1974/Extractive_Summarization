a marine clock used to help sailors take @entity2 around the world as he formed his theory of evolution has sold at auction for £ 100,000			1
the marine chronometer helped vice admiral @entity8 navigate the @entity9 around the tip of @entity11 and onwards to the @entity12 during its 1831 to 1836 voyages			1
it was during this trip that @entity2 , a budding naturalist , formed his theory of evolution after noticing variations and similarities between living animals and what he believed were fossils of their extinct ancestors			1
the marine chronometer ( pictured ) was owned by vice admiral @entity8 , who used it to sail across the world while his passenger @entity2 formed the theory of evolution the clock ( pictured ) was used by the ship 's captain to accurately calculate longitude in addition to latitude the clock , mounted in its gimbled mahogany box case , was sold by at auction by @entity37 for £ 100,900			1
its maker was the highly - regarded @entity40 , a pupil of clockmaker @entity41 who was famed for simplifying the production of chronometers			2
the revolutionary timepiece enabled sailors to accurately calculate longitude in addition to latitude - this allowed a level of accuracy for the @entity52 ship not previously possible			1
it measures 3.25inches high , by 6.25in wide and 6.25in deep			2
the previously unrecorded marine chronometer performed so well during @entity9 voyages that the @entity52 purchased it from vice admiral @entity8 in 1837			1
it was recorded as being used onboard @entity59 when she was sunk by a mine in @entity62 in 1916			2
it was later listed as lost			0
it then re-emerged during @entity65 onboard a ship used by the @entity67 on the @entity68 between the @entity69 and @entity70 under the command of @entity72 , said to be the first female commander of an ocean - going ship			0
the vendor ’s uncle served as a radio operator and was given the chronometer at the end of the war			0
in turn he presented it to the current owner on his entry to the @entity86 in 1975			0
@entity2 's book on the @entity88 - written based on his findings during the five - year trip on the @entity9 - is considered the founding work of evolutionary theory			1
published in 1859 , it suggested that species with common ancestry evolve into diverse life forms over long periods of time			0
the clock was used by vice admiral @entity8 ( illustrated ) during multiple voyages in the @entity9			1
however , it was the ship 's second trip which achieved the most fame , due to the research conducted by @entity2 while on board @entity106 , head of @entity37 ’ clock department , said : ' this is a fine example of a 19th century chronometer in its own right , but its association with @entity9 and @entity2 ’s epic voyage makes it even more significant and desirable			1
' it sold very strongly and we are delighted with the outcome			0
' the marine chronometer is the only surviving one from the @entity9 voyages made by @entity40 , a well respected chronometer maker			2
@entity120 was a technical breakthrough at the time as they allowed mariners to tell the time over long sea voyages by determining longitude by celestial navigation			2
the @entity9 ( illustrated left ) , was used to take @entity2 ( right ) across the world in a five year voyage that formed the basis for his landmark theory of evolution however , the value of the marine clock pales in comparison to that of @entity139 firm @entity138 's ' @entity137 ' , a 1925 timepiece that broke records when it sold last month for £ 15.1million			1
in total , the timepiece — with two clock faces , one on each side — has 24 complications			2
one shows the @entity148 , others the times of sunset and sunrise in @entity153 and even the pattern of the stars each night above mr @entity157 ’s apartment in the city			0
there are complications revealing the days of the week , an alarm , a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar			0
the watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made , the ‘ @entity165 of @entity166 ’			0
the ' @entity137 ' ( pictured ) is considered the most important watch ever made			0
it sold at auction last month for £ 15.1million			0

the clock was used by vice admiral @entity8 on board the @entity9
it helped sailors navigate by allowing an accurate calculation of longitude
his 1830s voyage with @entity2 led to the theory of evolution
