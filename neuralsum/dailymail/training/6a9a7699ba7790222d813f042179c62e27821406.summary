@entity0 leans back , puffs out his cheeks and says with a smile : ‘ you ’re really depressing me ! i think we ’ve spoken enough about that			1
’ the topic is @entity9 2 @entity10 3 , november 21 , 2007 — the night his ambitions as national manager turned to dust			1
a reluctance to continue the conversation beyond a 10th question is quite understandable , but so too is the link drawn from that match to now , the day @entity0 returns to the @entity19 dug - out			1
he does so , by his own admission , a better manager leading a vibrant @entity23 side into a game worth more than £ 130million to the victor			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity0 talk ahead of @entity27 play - off final on the brink : @entity23 boss @entity0 has put his side just one win away from promotion to the @entity33 staying dry costs : @entity0 was dubbed ' @entity0 ' as he watched @entity9 fail to qualify for @entity35 the fact that he owes this moment to the man who is his opponent on saturday makes the match even more fascinating			1
@entity40 gave @entity0 a coaching job at @entity42 at the start of this season that the former @entity9 manager calls ‘ fantastic for me ’			1
it saved him from trips to @entity48 and afternoons gardening			0
it also gave him an insight into ‘ the worst ’ dressing room he has witnessed , with players who ‘ did n’t want to be on the training field , did n’t want to play for @entity42			1
only @entity40 could have sorted that out ’			1
three months later and after positive reviews from inside @entity57 , @entity23 chief executive @entity55 came calling , having dismissed @entity58			1
the stint in west @entity60 was not pivotal to @entity0 ’s appointment but it helped soothe supporters initially angry at the removal of a legendary name			1
friendly face : @entity42 boss @entity40 gave @entity0 a coaching job at the start of the season but the two will take on each other at @entity19 the 53 - year - old unlocked the team ’s potential to such an extent that @entity23 head into this @entity27 play - off final as favourites despite bringing less experience and a significantly smaller annual wage bill ( £ 12m v £ 78m )			1
‘ it ’s a fairy - tale ending to the season , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ it will be great to see @entity40 , the staff and players again			1
i had three great months but i always had one eye on getting back into management and once this opportunity came i ’d have walked here			0
‘ @entity40 and i will have a cup of tea together before the game and a big hug at the end no matter what happens			1
’ @entity0 has been back to the scene of his darkest hour plenty of times in the past seven years , most recently for last weekend ’s @entity97 final , but never to marshal a team , never with the cameras directed his way			1
staying dry : @entity0 uses an umbrella during an @entity9 match in 2008 he was derided as the ‘ @entity0 ’ the last time as the rain fell and he stood sheltered under an umbrella watching @entity9 fail to qualify for @entity35			1
on this occasion he has been good - humoured enough to joke that he ‘ wo n’t be taking a bloody brolly ’			2
but he also addressed those memories with seriousness			0
‘ the biggest thing that hurt me that night and ever since , was the failure to qualify , ’ he says			0
‘ it felt like i ’d let the nation down			0
that ’s what i ’ve had to live with			0
that ’s the hardest thing , nothing else peripheral , like the “ @entity0 ”			2
‘ that disappointment will not go away and still hurts , but you have to get on with life and football			0
to be fair i wanted to work the next day			0
i wanted to get back on the bike as quickly as possible			0
i had support from a lot of good people and i think that is what you need			0
all managers go through it			0
’ on reflection , he thinks the @entity9 job came too soon but he felt compelled to take the opportunity , having guided @entity133 to one @entity134 and the @entity136 final			1
‘ i thought i was ready and the job finds out that you are not , ’ he says			2
‘ i did n’t have the experience			0
‘ but because i was @entity9 manager it has given me some great opportunities			2
i do n’t think i would have gone abroad unless i had actually done that job			2
so it had its bad and good points			0
’ a title with @entity144 in @entity145 and a spell at @entity147 in @entity148 followed , but last summer he was without a club , until a chat about coaching at @entity42 with @entity153 ’s @entity152 at a dinner			1
@entity156 spell : @entity0 guided @entity133 to one @entity134 and the @entity136 final during his tenure at the @entity159 going @entity160 : @entity0 won the @entity160 title with @entity144 in 2010 @entity23 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity162 ; wisdom , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 ; @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 ; @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171			1
@entity42 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity172 ; @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 ; @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 ; @entity182			1
kick - off : 3pm , @entity19			1
tv / radio : live on @entity185 and @entity186 from 2pm			0
saturday is the first time that goal - line technology will be used in a @entity192 match			2
the @entity194 system will be used for all three play - off finals			1
‘ he mooted the idea and said he would mention it to his dad , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ what was the choice ? doing the gardening and @entity48 ’s or working			0
’ the atmosphere he walked into , however , was toxic			0
‘ after a week i remember saying to @entity40 , “ you ’ve got a hell of a job on to turn it round ”			1
there were many players who did n’t want to be there			0
i think only @entity40 could have done that job , i really do			1
anybody with less experience or a foreign manager would not			0
‘ he had zero tolerance and the club were very supportive			0
after two months of hard work you could see they had a squad who ’d got spirit			0
there ’s a lot of pressure on @entity42 to go up , they are talking about a lot of money			2
@entity40 ’s done a fantastic job			1
’ most would say the job performed by @entity0 in lifting a team who were 14th when he took over to third with a club - record points haul and as the division ’s top scorers is rather brilliant too			1
eye - catching : under @entity235 are entertaining to watch and are the division 's top scorers training is detailed and enjoyable , loan signings have been smart , and substitutions more often than not paid off			0
the football is attractive , and the side are youthful — @entity23 ’s likely starting xi has an average age of 24.9			2
crowds have risen from an average of 23,228 last season to 24,933 this			0
the buzz reminds @entity0 of his time as assistant to @entity252 in the 1990s when the pair guided @entity23 to promotion and then consolidated in the @entity33			1
‘ they were great days with @entity252 , i knew then what @entity23 was all about , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ coming back we just want to create those times again			0
’ a cathartic win at @entity19 would begin to realise those hopes			2
‘ i was having afternoons off school to play matches – i probably was n’t cut out to teach really ! it does seem a bit ridiculous to spend four years qualifying and then to spend not so long actually doing it			0
’ friendly showdown : @entity40 and @entity0 face each other for a place in the @entity33 next season but all of that has gone into the making of a manager who is already attracting interest from @entity33 clubs			1
he is certainly more akin to a pe teacher in the technical area , preferring his tracksuit and jumper to any suave or sophisticated suits			0
will he make a change for @entity19 ? ‘ not on the touchline , ’ he insists			2
‘ i will lead my team out in a suit , but i ’ll be putting my tracksuit on for the game			0
i have to get my battle gear on , do n’t i ? ’ it seems hard to imagine this gentle giant as a general leading his troops to war , but come 3pm on saturday , battle will commence			0
@entity23 1 @entity293 , 21 the 6ft 2in january loan signing from @entity295 has taken to the @entity23 midfield like it ’s been his home for years			2
@entity167 will sit as the fulcrum , break up attacks , and start moves			0
2 @entity302 , 29 from @entity304 football with @entity305 in 2009 to the @entity33 in 2014 would be a remarkable journey but the central defender ( right ) commands respect with his solid displays			0
3 @entity310 , 25 became the first @entity23 player since @entity312 in 1996 to reach the 20 - goal mark and now has 25 for the season			1
not bad for a free summer transfer from @entity317			0
@entity42 1 @entity318 , 31 needs no introduction			2
marginalised by the club last season when he went to @entity323 on loan but pulling the strings in midfield now			0
can @entity179 be a hero ? 2 @entity327 , 29 been a @entity19 winner before with @entity329			2
@entity181 has fully recovered from a hamstring injury he suffered in the play - off second - leg win over @entity332			1
the @entity335 midfielder ’s experience will be a key factor			0
3 @entity337 , 24 @entity42 ’s goal machine			2
despite being out for more than two months with a shoulder injury he ’s hit top form at the right time and his 20th goal of the season sent his side to @entity19			1
if he fires @entity42 have a terrific chance of promotion .			2

@entity0 leads @entity23 into play - off final against @entity42 at @entity19
former @entity9 boss returns to dug - out for first time since *infamous* ' @entity0 with the @entity355 *incident* in 2008
@entity27 play - off final worth more than £ 130million to victor
@entity0 comes up against @entity40 , who gave him a coaching job at the start of the season at @entity57
