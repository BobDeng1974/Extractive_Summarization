by @entity1 reporter published : 23:30 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 01:52 est , 1 august 2012 having made history as the first skydiver to safely land without using a parachute , daredevil @entity2 is used to high - profile stunts			1
now , after acting as the @entity8 ’s skydiving stunt - double during the @entity9 , the father of two says he has realised his dream			1
‘ i had the best seat in the house for a show that was seen around the world , ’ he says			1
on the night , @entity2 , 43 , was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the @entity8 was wearing , and the duo were driven to @entity37 , @entity38			1
it was the first time he wore his costume			1
' i mean i ’ve worn my own dresses out loads of times , ' he joked			1
' but in terms of the jump it was the first time			1
' asked why he was chosen for the jump mr @entity2 replied : ' good question			1
i think they liked my legs			1
' he added : ' i ’ve got @entity8 - style legs			1
' their helicopter was given the all - clear to take off at 8.50pm by military air - traffic controllers and then guided into position over the arena at 800ft for the pair to make their entrance			1
after deploying their parachutes at 500ft , the duo steered away from the stadium and landed on a nearby bridge			2
@entity2 , who completed the world ’s first skydive without a parachute in may , now says he has only one regret from the night : ‘ i really wanted to keep the dress , but i was n’t allowed			1
it would have looked great on a night out			2
’ the result was the most talked - about sequence of @entity78 ’s stunning @entity77			2
the @entity8 was happy to accept her mission as the latest ' @entity80 ' especially for the @entity9 the @entity8 arrives in the @entity81 at the @entity82 alongside @entity84 president @entity83 ( left ) daredevil : @entity86 @entity2 , who stood in for the @entity8 , prepares his special ' wingsuit ' for a jump in may the @entity8 greets 007 at @entity89 with the words ' @entity90 , mr @entity23 ' in the film sequence leading up to her parachute ' jump ' in the segment , prerecorded at @entity89 , the @entity8 receives the 007 star with the words : ‘ good evening , mr @entity23			1
’ they then leave and walk towards a helicopter , corgis in tow , and at one point @entity102 gives a nuanced glance in @entity8 ’s direction			2
it was the @entity8 ’s first film role , but it was revealed that she needed only one take			1
‘ she ’s a good actor , ’ said mr @entity78			2
‘ she ’s very sharp			2
you did n’t have to tell her anything twice			2
’ not only that , he added , but she also ‘ got along with @entity23 very well ’			2
it was all the irrepressible mr @entity78 ’s idea			0
he raised it with @entity114 chief @entity113 , who thought it inspired			0
@entity23 actor @entity102 and the queen in the helicopter the helicopter hovered over the @entity82 , before the @entity8 jumped out , pulling the rip cord on a @entity120 parachute if @entity113 was a little doubtful , however , that it would be well received by the @entity8 ’s courtiers , he was quickly reassured			0
they listened sagely , laughed , and promised to ask the @entity125			0
the @entity126 discovered that it was her deputy private secretary , @entity127 , a former adviser to @entity128 , who acted as the go - between			0
some insiders refer to him as the ‘ secret agent ’ – because he was the key link between the @entity89 and mr @entity78 ’s team			0
lord @entity113 had served as chief of staff to @entity128 around the time mr @entity127 was working as the then @entity136 leader ’s communications chief			0
palace insiders felt it was a fortuitous connection that at least gave @entity113 a chance of winning approval for the plan			0
the idea appealed to mr @entity127 , 45 , who went to @entity143 and worked in managerial roles at @entity145 before becoming an adviser to shadow chancellor @entity147 and then mr @entity128			0
mr @entity127 , who is married , moved to @entity148 as communications director in 2001 before taking up his role at @entity89 in 2007			0
sources said her majesty ’s only stipulation for her acting role was that she would choose what to wear			1
eschewing the bikini favoured by some who have gone before her – most memorably @entity159 and @entity160 – she decided on a salmon dress			0
in the helicopter scene , she was played by @entity163 , famed for portraying @entity164			0
the scene concluded with the stunt double of the queen parachuting into the @entity82			0
seconds later the real @entity8 , wearing the same dress as she did in the filmed sequence , was met with roars of laughter and a standing ovation as she entered the arena together with prince @entity175			0
the @entity89 scenes were filmed in the quadrangle , the @entity176 , the @entity177 , the @entity178 and the @entity179 – and even starred her majesty ’s dogs , including 13 - year - old @entity184 , previously owned by the @entity185			1
the @entity8 was said to have ‘ immensely enjoyed ’ her acting experience			0
reciprocating mr @entity78 ’s favourable comments about her acting skills , the @entity8 declared his show ‘ wonderful ’			0
and one @entity191 veteran said : ‘ it was a brilliant and daring move – all film performances can slip from being such a good idea at the time to then getting an appalling reception from viewers			1
‘ @entity8 played a blinder by acting and , like all great performers , also being herself			0
