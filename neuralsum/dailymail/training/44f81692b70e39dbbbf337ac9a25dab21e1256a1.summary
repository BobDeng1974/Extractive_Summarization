@entity0 perched on a bench next to @entity2 4 a fortnight ago and took the chance to add to the family album			2
using her phone she snapped away , smiling and waiting for the right shots			2
neither of her two sets of twins were around , nor were many others			2
just the greatest player in the history of tennis and @entity14 , his @entity15 compatriot and hitting partner that day			1
@entity18 , worth 17 @entity20 titles and an estimated £ 140million , likes such keepsakes			1
these next couple of years are the final throes for a man one month short of his 33rd birthday , who recently told his @entity15 biographer of his wish ‘ to be 25 again so i had another 10 years of tennis ’			1
on form : @entity18 fist pumps after winning his quarter - final match on @entity32 holding things together : @entity18 's wife , @entity34 , looks after their young children he had a smile on his face as he said it , just as he did when he joked to the same author that he might one day return to @entity41 as a fan , camping in a tent and waiting in the queue for tickets			1
the smiles , according to those who know him , are the answers to questions of what has motivated him to continue during his two - year @entity20 drought , with a legacy supposedly at stake and his ranking slipping			1
he fell to eighth , his second - round loss here last year perhaps the biggest indignity			2
why hang on as a shadow of your former self ? on thursday , he was back at @entity2 4 , a @entity41 semi-finalist having a hit before stepping in front of @entity66 on friday afternoon			1
the practice session was tame ; the crowd enormous			2
when it was over , five security guards formed a protective cordon around the ageing tennis player with the dodgy back			1
occasionally , he stopped his escort for a high five with the fans , a great of sport having the time of his second life			2
practice makes perfect : fans flocked to get a glimpse of @entity18 on court four on thursday dominant : @entity18 is back to his best after a nightmare 2013 how he has fought his way back into prominence — and the top four — after the nightmares of 2013 , is a tale of nannies , coaches and physiotherapy ; it ’s a comeback supported further by private planes , @entity34 ’s diary and , simply , a love for the game			1
@entity101 is one of his closer friends in tennis and has watched as @entity18 recovered from his 2013 season , in which serious back injuries limited him to a single title — his worst return since 2001			1
‘ it is amazing to me , ’ @entity101 said			2
‘ i was a similar age when i stopped			2
for the first time ever it was my job not my hobby			2
' for me , when i look at him i see how much he enjoys it			0
i honestly think it is about his personal enjoyment of tennis			0
the challenge was last year			0
that is when you , or he , would really question it			0
but he has the hunger			0
support : @entity101 ( left ) has backed @entity18 to win @entity41 ‘ i was speaking recently to @entity125 ( @entity127 ’s @entity126 coach ) and he was telling me @entity128 went to practise with @entity18 for a week in @entity15			1
apparently his work rate was incredible , the intensity of it			0
that is a guy who has nothing to prove			0
those are the standards he sets			0
’ they are standards maintained in the organisation of his private life , driven by a wife who is said to apply extreme precision to the running of his domestic affairs			0
when @entity18 travelled to the @entity144 three weeks after the birth of his second set of twins , it is understood all four children joined him in @entity149			1
a private plane and airstrip are understood to have been used , with five nannies part of the entourage			0
it is believed to be a regular arrangement			0
‘ @entity159 keeps the whole thing together and oversees the organising of their life , ’ said @entity157 , his biographer			0
mental toughness : @entity18 has hired @entity164 as his coach ‘ @entity18 loves everything in tennis			1
he says when he stops playing he ’ll come back here one day and wants to be a supporter			2
he joked he wants to sleep in a tent and queue			0
but @entity34 is the person in the background who i think keeps it going smoothly for him now			0
’ on the court , @entity18 is now using a bigger racket for a greater margin of error and has hired @entity164 as a coach to freshen his mental approach			1
his schedule was also reworked			0
it is understood @entity18 is worth £ 600,000 a time on the exhibition circuit , which is how he spent his off - season in december 2012			1
last winter , he went to @entity185 to train			0
‘ i believe i worked the hardest from the top eight in the off - season , ’ @entity18 told @entity186 earlier this year			1
next up : @entity66 stands between @entity18 and a place in the final but can he win another @entity20 ? it is a tough ask for a father of four , as @entity193 illustrated this week			1
‘ i found it extremely difficult to juggle the responsibilities and joys of children , ’ @entity193 said			0
‘ with trying to be a good father and trying to stave off that inevitable decline , i did n’t do nearly as good a job as @entity18 does			1
’ indeed , since 1990 only eight slams have been won by fathers			0
with two more children it is tougher again			0
but when has @entity18 ever been like the rest ?			1

@entity15 star had a nightmare 2013 but is back on top form in @entity211
@entity18 , 32 , is bidding for his 18th @entity20 title this week
