by @entity0 last updated at 2:35 am on 29th january 2012 a second former @entity3 minister is under investigation over allegations of mobile - phone expenses fraud , the @entity1 can reveal			1
fraud squad detectives are formally investigating a series of allegedly bogus expense claims submitted by former td and junior minister @entity11			1
the investigation by officers at the @entity14 has been running in tandem with the separate probe into the expense claims of @entity18 , the former td , junior minister and senator			1
inquiry : senator @entity18 in @entity22 in 2010 , after our exposé into his bogus expenses claims mr @entity18 was arrested and released without charge this week and a file was sent to the @entity28			1
the investigation was sparked by @entity31 revelations in august 2010 that mr @entity18 had claimed almost € 3,000 in mobile phone expenses using receipts that could not be genuine			1
the controversial former minister later accepted that the receipts were bogus but insists he is innocent and that somebody else was responsible for the fakes			1
if he is charged and convicted , he could face up to 10 years in jail for obtaining money using a ‘ false instrument ’			0
weeks after the @entity18 exposé , the @entity31 revealed that his @entity3 colleague mr @entity11 had also claimed over € 2,200 in mobile - phone expenses using receipts that could not be genuine			1
however , while senator @entity18 ’s bogus claims were immediately looked into by the @entity47 authorities – who then passed the matter on to gardaí and the @entity28 – @entity52 officials took no action against mr @entity11			1
despite being made aware of the evidence against mr @entity11 , the @entity47 authorities – headed by @entity56 clerk @entity56 – have never investigated			1
mr @entity56 himself has repeatedly insisted that the expenses were legitimate and that there was no question of a bogus invoice being submitted or accepted			2
mr @entity56 allowed mr @entity11 to submit fresh paperwork ‘ correcting ’ the information in one disputed invoice – and has ever since insisted the claim was ‘ properly made ’			1
this stance seems to contradict the view taken by gardaí , who appear to believe the former minister has questions to answer			0
six months after our revelations , mr @entity11 retired when the general election was called in february 2011			1
however , a @entity14 investigation into mr @entity11 ’s expenses was formally launched in september 2011 after our evidence was handed over to @entity14 detectives			1
the dossier includes three invoices that mr @entity11 submitted to claim € 2,237.53 in expenses from the @entity47			1
the invoices were all on headed note paper apparently from @entity85 – a respected @entity86 dealership in @entity87 , south @entity88			1
mr @entity11 ’s invoices were not questioned by the @entity91 authorities and he was paid the full amount on the invoices			1
but as soon as the @entity31 saw the three receipts , a number of irregularities were immediately apparent			2
one issue was that the invoices appeared to have been printed on standard headed paper			2
when the @entity31 obtained a genuine invoice from @entity85 , it was markedly different to the amateurish versions submitted by mr @entity11			1
the documents provided to the @entity47 by mr @entity11 also had no invoice numbers : a @entity105 accounts employee insisted that all the firm ’s invoices carry such a number			1
in addition , just one of the invoices bore a vat number – another standard feature of any legitimate sales docket			1
moreover , all of the invoices had charged vat at the incorrect rate of 13.5 %			2
the revenue confirmed to the @entity31 that the correct vat rate for installing mobile phone kits at the time was 21 %			2
but possibly the most glaring aspect of the invoices was the amount involved , which seemed impossibly high for the goods and services listed			2
for example , one of the invoices bills € 330 in labour charges even though no labour is required to install the component listed			2
crucially , the @entity31 also established that @entity105 ’ own accounts did not show the firm having received all of the payments claimed by mr @entity11			2
mr @entity11 has always insisted the invoices are genuine and that he got them ‘ free and fair ’			1
@entity91 expenses will now be kept secret the @entity47 has introduced a new expenses system under which it will be almost impossible to root out bogus claims like @entity18 ’s			1
until recently , any claims for vouched expenses had to be backed up with a receipt which was then retained by the @entity47			2
it was the examination of such receipts which allowed the @entity1 to show that @entity18 ’s mobile phone claims were based on fake invoices – leading directly to his arrest last week			1
exposé : how the @entity31 broke the story of @entity11 ’s claims , now being investigated by @entity155 now , however , the rules have been changed so that tds and senators will not have to supply receipts – even for supposedly ‘ vouched ’ expenses			1
they will simply claim for amounts they say they have spent , with the @entity47 trusting them to give accurate figures			0
the only method of policing the claims is a system of random audits , under which one in ten politicians will be asked to provide the receipts to back up their claims			1
however , for 90 % of politicians , no receipts will ever have to be handed over – meaning that the invoices can not be checked to ensure they are genuine			1
tds and senators will be obliged to hold on to the receipts for five years , but unless they are audited , there is no means by which a member of the media or public can ever get their hands on them – even by using @entity186			1
expenses campaigner and chartered accountant @entity187 said that even if invoices were genuine , there could be abuses			2
‘ there are no rules insisting on value for money , or that the work does not go to family or friends for these expenses			0
‘ so legitimately , a td could give a newsletter printing contract at an inflated price to a party supporter or cousin			0
because we ca n’t get the invoices under @entity207 , we ca n’t check for this , and the auditors wo n’t – it ’s not within their remit			2
’ ms @entity187 warned that the new policy was further erosion of our ability to check how politicians are spending our money			2
she said : ‘ only a minority of the expenses paid to our politicians can be subject to audit as most payments are fixed allowances paid automatically with no necessity to ever show that anything like the amount paid was actually incurred			0
‘ this audit related to only 10 % of the tds and @entity177 who opted for the higher allowance – why not look at those who opt to be paid the lower allowance of € 15,000 per annum			2
i call this the “ no questions asked ” allowance			0
‘ the fact that something like half our politicians opt for the lower figure tells me that they have very few legitimate parliamentary expenses and that the allowance is a form of untaxed salary for them			0
’ the @entity1 has obtained a copy of the first independent audit of these vouched expenses			0
prepared by @entity252 , the audit raises a series of issues about the @entity47 expenses regime and its loose rules			0
it said there were no firm rules on what could and could not be claimed by tds and senators in a number of key areas			0
amongst the items purchased , which had to be signed off without clear guidelines , were : bank interest and fees , the purchase of computer equipment , and ‘ sundry items ’ like newspapers , biscuits , tea and coffee			0
the audit report said : ‘ during our audit we noted a number of expenditure claims which do not appear to have official guidelines as to whether they are allowable or not			0
’ it said clarity was necessary on the purchase of items such as laptops and printers , and particularly whether they should be returned to the @entity290 if the politicians eventually lose their seat			0
a source in @entity52 said : ‘ the issue here is whether that politician then owns the equipment even though they have used somebody else ’s money to buy it			0
’ the report also said there was an issue in relation to the funding of advertising by tds and senators for party colleagues using public funds			0
according to guidelines , adverts should simply state the most basic information about when constituency clinics were being held			0
but in a number of cases , it appears other information including slogans and joint advertisements with party members were being paid for by the taxpayer			0
the report said : ‘ we consider that further clarity should be provided to members as to these conditions which must be met and the criteria in order to be a qualifying expense			0
’ it further noted problems with telephone bills : ‘ the level of detail of evidence submitted varied for this expenditure category … [ it ] should show the member ’s telephone numbers assigned for the relevant period for public representation purposes			0
’ another problem noted in the report was the hiring of meeting rooms			0
the @entity47 had decided in march 2010 to create the two expenses options – the lower ‘ unvouched ’ payment with no audit , or a higher ‘ vouched ’ payment that could be subject to audit			0
a statement said : ‘ the core purpose of this audit was to establish whether members had valid evidence of vouchers , receipts and bills in respect of the amount paid to them			0
‘ the audit report also includes the auditors ’ recommendations to provide further definition and clarity			0
’ the @entity47 defended the new procedures , saying : ‘ the audit of the public representation allowance was conducted … [ to facilitate ] the first audit of expenses of a random sample of members and preparation of the audit report for the @entity47			0
‘ members who were in receipt of vouched allowance amounts must retain the evidence of the expenses incurred , for inspection only , to an auditor appointed by the @entity382			0

as @entity28 mulls @entity18 file , fraud squad mounts inquiry into @entity11 invoices
as *disgraced* @entity18 is arrested over our exposé of his fake receipts , we reveal that in *future* such bogus claims would never come to light – because the public will not be able to examine the invoices put in by 90 % of politicians
