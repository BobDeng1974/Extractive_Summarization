the survey , commissioned by @entity19 found that only 18 per cent of people thought there was no need for a referendum in the foreseeable future			0
however , the poll also found there was considerable uncertainty among voters with nearly three out of ten ( 27 per cent ) saying they ‘ did n’t know ’ if the @entity1 should be ' part of the single market in a wider @entity31 '			2
when asked whether @entity1 should remain in the @entity32 , keeping open the option of joining a more integrated @entity34 , 44 per cent disagreed , with 36 per cent saying yes and remainder ( 19 per cent ) saying they ' did n’t know '			1
the government has played down suggestions that an announcement of a referendum could come as early as this autumn at the party conference			1
while @entity3 markets reacted positively this morning to the news that eurozone leaders had agreed to loan @entity45 up to £ 80billion to bailout its struggling economy , @entity1 is expected to feel the impact of the economic turmoil in @entity3 within days			1
credit agency @entity50 is expected to downgrade the credit status of both @entity52 and the @entity53 by up to two places imminently			0

impact : credit agency @entity50 is expected to downgrade both @entity52 and the @entity53 are by up to two places imminently chancellor @entity60 wrote in a newspaper article yesterday that @entity1 ’s attempts to rebuild its battered economy were being held back the crisis on the continent			2

criticised : chancellor @entity60 wrote in a newspaper article yesterday that @entity1 ¿ s attempts to rebuild its battered economy were being held back by the crisis on the continent according to @entity100 , the former defence secretary , even if it does n’t come in the immediate future a referendum is inevitable when @entity3 treaties are rewritten to solve the @entity3 crisis			1
mr @entity60 made this point last week when he said during a radio interview that any redrawing of @entity3 treaties would shift powers from the @entity1 to @entity3 which would automatically trigger a vote under the terms of the treaty drawn up			2
although the nature of how any such referendum question would be worded is not clear with aides to the chancellor stating that he had not intended to suggest that it would necessarily be a straight ‘ in ’ or ‘ out ’ question			0
