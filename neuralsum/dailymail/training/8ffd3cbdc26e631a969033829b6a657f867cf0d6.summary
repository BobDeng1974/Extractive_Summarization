a deeply worrying trend , known as ‘ slut - shaming , ’ has taken flight in recent years , fuelled by microblogging sites such as @entity4 , as well as @entity5			1
in these posts , teenage girls – and sometimes boys – criticize certain body types or wardrobe choices , often being ruthless in the process			2
in one such post , a blogger writes with accompanying pictures : ‘ hey girls , uhm did you know – open books , not legs ? ’ slut - shaming : this image , uploaded to a @entity4 account last summer , started a new slut - shaming meme called @entity24 , did you know ? girl on girl : the @entity24 , did you know facebook page is full of posts like this , where girls will ridicule other girls for the way they dress or look mean girls : in another post , a teenager tells girls that @entity38 is for spreading , not legs the image that started one particular meme of slut - shaming was the ‘ @entity43 , did you know ’ post , when @entity4 user officialsabrina_xo uploaded a photo of her with captions saying , ‘ girls , did you know , that uhm , your boobs go inside your shirt ? ’ according to @entity55 , the image was removed shortly after it was uploaded , but the damage was done			1
starting on june 18th , 2012 , the image of the brunette was reblogged across the internet , sparking the meme			2
a week later , the @entity61 , did you know facebook page was formed			0
as of this year , it has nearly 37,000 ‘ likes			0
’ while a majority of the photos are simply innocuous memes like @entity70 or pictures of cats or other harmless memes , others point out what they perceive to be as shortcomings of their peers			0
advice : one girl garnered thousands of ' likes ' on @entity5 because of this photo retribution : in response to some photos , teenage boys offer their responses cruel : this photo , also from @entity24 , did @entity88 's @entity5 page plays on the normally - snarky some ecards one girl posted : ‘ @entity98 citizens , did you know ? this is deodorant			1
use it , ’ which was accompanied by various expressions with a stick of @entity93 , followed by a picture of her frowning			2
the image , posted on december 2 , 2012 , was shared 33 times and liked by 1,335 people			2
in 2011 , male model @entity108 was pictured with an outer - space background holding a sign that read : ‘ @entity111 , do n’t be insecure , you do n’t need make - up and nice clothes			1
you ’re all f * * * * * * beautiful			0
’ in response , @entity4 user einsteinonacid posted a photo in response that read : ‘ dear boy in outer space : do n’t tell me what to do			1
’ shaming or inspiring ? @entity121 , model @entity108 created a stir by posting this photo telling girls they 're beautiful without makeup ; below , not everyone was so inspired as @entity130 notes , what is interesting about the former meme is that it was one created by girls , who seek to shame other girls , perhaps because of low self - esteem or because they are bullies with the veil of the internet to protect them			1
‘ slut shaming ’ has been around in many incarnations in recent years			0
last december , @entity140 high school students staged a riot after a photo was posted on @entity143 requesting that all ‘ sluts ’ were identified			1
in response , some 200 pictures were posted , mostly of 13 - year - old girls			1
outraged , students in @entity149 took to the streets in protest			0
in total , 27 young people were arrested in the riots , according to @entity140 news site @entity156			0
while initial reports said that the original photograph was posted by a 17 - year - old girl , police now have a new suspect			0
the girl is in a safe location , and has maintained her innocence .			0
