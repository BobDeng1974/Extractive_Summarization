by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:07 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:07 est , 16 december 2013 emperor penguins maintain the tight huddle that protects them from the harsh conditions of an @entity9 winter with stop - and - go movements like cars in a traffic jam , a new study has shown			1
@entity14 researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it			1
these tiny movements then flow through the entire group - which includes thousands of penguins - like a wave			1
the male and female are similar in plumage and size , reaching 48inches ( 122cm ) in height and weighing anywhere from 49 to 99lbs ( 22 to 45 kg )			0
like all penguins the @entity31 is flightless , but has a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat			0
its diet consists primarily of fish , but can also include crustaceans , such as krill , and cephalopods , such as squid			0
in hunting , the species can remain submerged for up to 18 minutes , diving to a depth of 1,755 ft ( 535m )			0
it has several adaptations to facilitate this , including an unusually structured hemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels , solid bones to reduce barotrauma and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions			0
the emperor is the only penguin species that breeds during the @entity9 winter , it treks 31 – 75 miles ( 50 – 120 km ) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals			2
their lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild , although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age			0
the stop - and - go motion plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold , while the wave also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones			1
researchers from the @entity87 , @entity88 for @entity89 and @entity90 ( @entity87 ) , in @entity91 , @entity14 , used a mathematical model to recreate the positions , movements and interactions of individual penguins in a huddle			1
in a previous study , the same group of researchers studied time - lapse videos and showed that instead of remaining static , penguins in a huddle actually move every 30 to 60 seconds , causing surrounding penguins to move with them			1
@entity106 , co-author of the study , which is published in the @entity108 and @entity110 ’s @entity109 , said : ‘ our previous study showed how penguins use travelling waves to allow movement in a densely packed huddle , but we had no explanation as to how these waves propagate and how they are triggered			2
’ @entity14 researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it			1
this is a screenshot of the animation showing the stop - and - go movement of the penguins to investigate this , the researchers used a mathematical model , which has previously been used to study traffic jams and compared the results with an analysis of video recordings of a real - life penguin huddle			1
unlike a traffic jam , the researchers found that the waves of movements in a penguin huddle can originate from any single penguin and can propagate in any direction as soon as a sufficient gap , known as a ‘ threshold distance ’ develops between two penguins			1
to cope with the harsh conditions , the male penguins form dense huddles , often consisting of thousands of individuals , to maintain their body temperatures this threshold distance was estimated to be around two cm , which is twice the thickness of a penguin ’s compressive feather layer , suggesting the penguins touch each other only slightly when standing in a huddle without compressing the feather layer so they maximise huddle density without compromising their own insulation and warmth			2
‘ we were really surprised that a travelling wave can be triggered by any penguin in a huddle , rather than penguins on the outside trying to push in , ’ said dr @entity106			2
‘ we also found it amazing how two waves , if triggered shortly after each other , merged instead of passing one another , making sure the huddle remains compact			0
’ the stop - and - go motion of the penguins plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold , while the wave ( illustrated in a computer model ) also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones the emperor penguin is the only vertebrate species that breeds during the severe conditions of the @entity9 winter			1
at this time of year temperatures can get as low as -50 ° c and winds can reach speeds of up to 200 kmp			0
to cope with the harsh conditions , the male penguins form dense huddles , often consisting of thousands of individuals , to maintain their body temperatures			2
unlike other species of penguin , the male emperors are solely responsible for incubating their single egg during the winter , covering it in an abdominal pouch above their feet while the female returns to sea to feed			0
