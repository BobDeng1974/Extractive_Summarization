a mourner was told to produce her late friend 's death certificate after being given a £ 60 parking ticket during a funeral			1

successful appeal : @entity5 , 70 , of @entity6 , east @entity7 , was told by @entity9 parking officers to ask her late friend ’s relatives for a copy of the death certificate , to prove she was at his funeral the slots were held until 6.30pm - and the secretary was fined despite arriving just before then , prompting a four - month battle with the council ’s parking team			1
miss @entity5 immediately appealed the fine , but weeks later she was sent a letter warning her that she had 14 days to provide a copy of the death certificate or pay the £ 60			1
she said : ‘ i had to go to the family at such a sad time for them - i was really embarrassed			0
i thought that was really nasty - it ’s left a very bad taste			0
‘ they should n’t be doing that			0
i had to go to my neighbour to get the death certificate as proof that i was at the funeral			2
if they ’re doing that to me , what are they doing to other people ? ’ she sent a copy of the certificate to parking officers and threatened to take her appeal to the council parking adjudicator			0
but she received a letter last month saying her appeal had been successful			0

she said : ‘ @entity9 apologises for any distress that ms @entity5 and her neighbours have experienced during this sad time			2
' as requested by the relatives , bays in the residents ’ parking zone were suspended to accommodate the funeral cortege and the council was also provided with registration details of these vehicles			1
' the spokesman added : ' ms @entity5 ’s car was not one of these vehicles and she was issued with a @entity86			2
' at the time we considered it was reasonable to request a death certificate be provided as evidence			0
