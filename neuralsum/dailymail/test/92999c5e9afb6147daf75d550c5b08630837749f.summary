a married couple who have endured the heartbreak of ten miscarriages in ten years , have revealed the joy of becoming parents to their miracle daughter			1
last year @entity6 , 36 , and @entity7 , 35 , from south @entity8 , never gave up hope of becoming parents despite being told they 'd never conceive naturally			1
yet last september they defied doctors to have @entity14 , who was born seven weeks early , weighing just 3lb 11oz			1
@entity6 and @entity7 show off their longed - for daughter @entity15 @entity6 , a project manager , said : ' we 'd just been put on the waiting list for @entity18 , when i had an inkling i might be pregnant			1
' after feeling queasy and exhausted , she decided to take a pregnancy test , which confirmed that she was expecting			2
@entity7 , a technician , said : ' it was wonderful to find out that @entity6 was pregnant , but after so many miscarriages , we could not help but worry			1
' the pair , who met when they were 18 , were just about to jet off to @entity29 for a holiday and quickly booked themselves in for a private scan			2
@entity7 said : ' it may sound strange , but after about six miscarriages , we just got used to it - to being let down every time			2
' during their holiday , @entity6 continued to suffer from sickness and giddiness and went straight to the @entity42 in @entity43 when they returned home			2
project manager @entity6 , pictured with her treasured daughter , advises other mums struggling with infertility to not give up after telling the midwife their history they were referred to the sonographer and a scan revealed a heartbeat			1
' we could n't stop the tears - we were in pieces			2
we even had the sonographer in tears , ' @entity6 said			0
in the weeks that followed , the pair were told that their baby was developing well and found out at the 20 - week scan that they were expecting a girl			1
everything went smoothly until 29 weeks , when @entity6 's waters broke so early , the doctors did not believe they had gone			1
she recalled : ' i was in a state of panic			0
but they hooked me up to machines to check her and , thank @entity75 , she was ok			0
' @entity6 was told that she was experiencing @entity76 - a tightening of the muscles in the womb - and sent home			0
the couple then spent the next few days in and out of hospital			1
' @entity82 was creeping back into both of us , ' she said			0
' in fact , scared just is n't the word			0
' the doctors eventually confirmed that her waters had broken and she was sent to a specialist unit at @entity91 in @entity92 for close monitoring			0
after going into labour early , @entity6 feared she 'd lost @entity14 and could n't hold her newborn for five hours ' i was in agony with the pain of every baby kick , stretch , minor movement or hiccup , ' she said			1
@entity6 spent the next two weeks in hospital , but did not go into labour and decided to go home			1
she eventually went into labour on september 30 and was booked in for an emergency caesarean , as the baby was in the breech position			1
@entity14 was born at 33 weeks at the @entity42 in @entity43 at 2.52pm , weighing just 3ib 11oz			1
@entity6 said : ' she let out a cry and we were in tears - we were finally parents			0
but instead of handing her to me , the midwife raced away because she needed help breathing			0
' i did n't get to see her until five hours after she was born and the first cuddle , with wires and tubes , was not until the next day			0
' the couple decided to call their daughter @entity15			2
the couple said they became ' used ' to the heartbreak of miscarriages after losing ten babies @entity6 said : ' i was handed @entity14 , complete with tubes and wires , and i crumbled with a perfect rush of emotion and love			1
' @entity6 was discharged from hospital , but @entity14 had to stay in neonatal care for three weeks			2
' it was terrifying to leave her , ' she said			0
' we spent all day by her cot and i was in tears every night			0
