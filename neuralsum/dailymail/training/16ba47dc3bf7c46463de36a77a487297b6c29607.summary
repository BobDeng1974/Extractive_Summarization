his spell at @entity11 saw @entity0 reach new heights , scoring more than 5,000 first - class runs at an average of 55.86 during his five seasons with the county and earning nine test caps			2
at @entity9 , @entity0 was rewarded for his impressive performances with a call - up to the @entity4 team @entity0 ( right ) scored over 5000 first - class runs while at @entity9 between 2009 and this summer @entity22 , director of cricket at @entity1 , is delighted that @entity0 has returned he left by mutual consent this summer having slipped off the international radar entirely , despite having signed a new three - year deal in 2013 , and there was some doubt over whether or not he would return to county cricket at all			1

' we are delighted to welcome @entity0 back to @entity1 , ' said @entity22			1
' players of @entity0 's ability do not become available very often and when we were made aware of his desire to move back to @entity31 we immediately moved			2
' i was in charge at @entity1 when @entity0 left at the end of the 2009 season and , even though i could at the time totally understand his reasons for moving to @entity11 , i was disappointed when he left			1
' it will be great to see him once again wearing a @entity1 cap and sweater , and i believe he has a lot to offer us both on and off the field over the course of the next five or six years			2
' @entity0 celebrates after scoring a century for his country against @entity53 in @entity54 in march , 2013 while @entity1 see @entity0 as an experienced head to lead the batting order while @entity57 spends most of his summer on @entity59 duty with @entity60 , @entity0 has not given up hope of persuading @entity4 he can play a part in the same series			1
and with @entity22 as a selector , he is certainly in the right place			0
@entity0 said : ' the time i spent at @entity11 was great for me			0
i also fulfilled the dream of representing @entity4 , which is something i am determined to do again			0
