the culprit was her boyfriend , @entity14 , 26			1
now , more than a decade on , her family have revealed that they 're still haunted by @entity12 's violent death and are tortured by the thought that they could have done more to extract her from @entity14 's clutches			1
we miss her at special occasions , like @entity35			0
' it ’s a hole that you feel empty			0
and the thought of what happened that night in that flat will haunt me for the rest of my life			0
' @entity12 was murdered by someone who she loved and trusted - her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child , @entity14			1
despite a 10 - year age gap , the pair had met through friends and had a sexual relationship			0
part - time fireman @entity14 was a known in the area as a ' jack the lad ' who helped with community projects like a boxing club for teenagers			1
youngsters , @entity12 among them , were said to have ' worshipped ' him			2
but @entity27 was not won over by his seemingly charismatic demeanour and disliked the way he seemed to control and belittle her sister			1
she was also concerned by his penchant for hosting young teenagers at his flat , where he threw parties and bought them cigarettes and alcohol			0
tragic : pregnant teen @entity12 , 17 , was suffocated and dismembered by her boyfriend , @entity14 ' he loved himself , he loved attention on him , ' @entity27 said of why @entity14 hung out with younger people who idolised him rather than those his own age			1
' i did not like him at all , i knew that there was something about him			0
i knew he had control over her			0
' unbeknown to @entity27 , @entity14 's control over @entity12 also extended to the bedroom			1
before she died , @entity12 had confided in a friend about his penchant for violent sex			1
on one occasion , he tried to put a pillow over her face			0

three months after they met , @entity12 become pregnant and @entity14 's true colours started to show			1
he did n't want to be a father and denied the baby was his			0
@entity27 recalls how the situation unfolded : ' @entity12 had phoned me and she had told me that she had her suspicions that she was pregnant			1
he did n't want to be a father , so he tried to make out @entity12 was with somebody else			2
tragedy : @entity12 's father @entity99 ( right ) and sister @entity27 ( left ) at her funeral at @entity101 in @entity3 tragedy : @entity12 's funeral on 3rd april 1998 was attended by mourners from all over @entity3 ' it makes me feel very angry that he was trying to make it out like that			1
she moved out not long after she told him about the baby			0
she would have wanted things to work , but i had told her that i would always be there for her if things did n't work out with her and @entity14			2
' despite moving out , @entity12 , who had just gained a job at a care home , continued to see @entity14 in the hope of rekindling their relationship			1
but the decision to go to his house on the night of friday , 3rd april , 1998 , proved to be a fatal one			0
before @entity12 arrived , @entity14 had told two 14 - year - old friends , who were at the flat in @entity125 that night , of his plans to murder the mother of his unborn child			1
they thought it was a joke but when @entity12 arrived he took her off to his bedroom and gave her alcohol and sleeping pills , blindfolded and tied her up to the bed , taped up her eyes and mouth and then injected her with insulin			2
commenting on the case , dr @entity137 , a criminal profiler who works with @entity140 , explains : ' if you give insulin to somebody who ’s not diabetic , what it does is it lowers their blood sugar levels , and induces eventually a form of coma			0
' so he gave her alcohol , gave her valium , and gave her insulin , so she became almost like a zombie			0
and he could then use her as a sexual object to carry out his sadistic sexual pleasure			0
' at some point , @entity12 lost her life but police remain unsure of the exact circumstances			1
however , they were certain that this was not a sex game gone wrong and that @entity14 had intended to commit murder			2
the next morning , after threatening his 14 - year - old accomplices with the spectre of prison , he and the teens wrapped the body in a blanket , put it in the attic and went swimming			1
' after they had done what they ’d done , they went swimming in the local leisure centre , and it makes me feel physically sick to think that they were able to go on about their own business knowing what they had done that night , ' adds @entity27			2
but events were about to catch up with @entity14			2
worried by @entity12 's continued absence , @entity27 went to @entity14 's flat to try and find her sister			1
@entity188 : @entity12 's unrepentant killer , @entity14 , was given 17 years in prison for her murder she recalls : ' we had our suspicions that he had hurt her			1
we walked in to the flat and @entity14 was sitting on the bed and his eyes was all red , pure red			2
' i happened to glance up at the attic door , and he had seen me , and he moved us into the living room and he kept saying that he did n’t know where she was , he had n’t heard from her			0
' he seemed very agitated , he kept repeating himself			0
i did have a suspicion that he had hurt her and had her up in the attic			0
never did i think it went as far as it did			0
' as @entity27 was at the police station reporting @entity12 missing , @entity14 set about disposing of her body			1
after cutting her into eight pieces , the killer enlisted the help of a friend to help him dispose of her various body parts across the town , including at a site where new homes were being built			1
but seven weeks later , @entity14 's attempt to cover his tracks unravelled , when his accomplice confessed his part in the crime to police and told them the whereabouts of @entity12 's head			1
the gruesome discovery sent shockwaves through the town and left @entity27 devastated			2
' when the police told me they had found part of a body they thought was her , i remember thinking " part of a body ? " what the hell has happened to my sister ? ' dental records confirmed it was @entity12			1

' there have been a lot of callous , horrendous murders in @entity5 , even by @entity5 's cruel standards , this was a shocking murder			0
' she added : ' the judge talked in the trial of the degradation and humiliation of @entity12			2
apart from the obviously sadistic way that she was murdered and dismembered , and callously placed under floorboards , it was the fact that he had no respect whatsoever [ for @entity12 ]			1

' @entity14 showed no remorse as he was found guilty and ordered to serve a minimum 19 year sentence			2
