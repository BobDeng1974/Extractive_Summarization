the @entity0 has voted to approve rules that make internet services in the @entity3 should be in the same regulatory camp as telephones			2
this means , providers like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , will have to act in the ' public interest ' when providing your internet connection			1
the goal is to prevent those providers from creating paid internet ' fast lanes ' and charging some sites to move their data faster than others			1
broadband and fiber - optic service providers would n't potentially be able to create a tiered system where companies had to pay ' tolls ' to get content to customers faster			1
what is the @entity0 voting on ? the @entity0 voted on whether to reclassify broadband access as a ' telecommunications service under @entity49 ' in simple terms , the @entity0 has reclassified broadband as a utility , giving it more regulatory power over internet providers			1
this means sites that create the content you read and watch online , wo n't face discrimination by network owners			1
for instance , @entity8 ca n't block @entity62 on your smartphone , like it did in 2011			1
will changing how internet service providers are regulated also change your internet bill ? it 's likely too early to say			2
@entity0 chairman @entity22 reasons internet service providers should still retain their pricing flexibility because he is n't suggesting implementing the part of proposal that would let the @entity0 set rates			1
what 's the difference between an @entity74 and a content provider ? an internet service provider is a company that provides you with access to the internet			1
major players include @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity7 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
@entity37 and @entity84 , meanwhile , are content providers			1
an @entity74 can also a content provider , such as @entity7 which owns @entity86			2
if the proposal goes ahead , a video service could n't be blocked or slowed down , for instance , because it competes with an offering from the carrier			1
for instance , @entity8 ca n't block @entity62 on your smartphone , like it did in 2011 what does this mean for smartphones ? even wireless carriers will fall under @entity99 if @entity22 's proposal			1
that 's important given that mobile phones are becoming the primary way that many people watch online video , play games , read and shop			0
the @entity0 estimates that about 55 per cent of all internet traffic now travels over mobile broadband networks			2
a video service could n't be blocked or slowed down , for instance , because it competes with an offering from the carrier			1
the proposal also extends to apps			0
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity116 are developing a mobile payment system called @entity118 , for instance , and blocking access to rival payment apps such as @entity122 would be barred			2
@entity0 chairman @entity22 has three primary goals : to prevent internet service providers from blocking traffic to any website obeying @entity3 laws ; to ban ' throttling , ' the practice of slowing down service for a commercial purpose ; and to prevent the creation of ' fast lanes ' @entity135 commissioner @entity134 warned ' that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data ' a @entity143 board member last month issued a doomsday warning on his government agency 's plan to adopt so - called net neutrality rules			1
@entity135 commissioner @entity134 pushed back on the decision by holding a press conference to disparage the @entity0 's @entity151 ' secret plan ' to take control of the internet that he cautioned would bring about ' adverse consequences to the entire internet economy			0
' @entity134 warned ' that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data ' and have ' less choice and less free data ' if the plan is put into effect			2
' my bottom line , if you like your current service plan , you should be able to keep your current service plan , ' he said			0
' the @entity0 should n't take it away from you			0
' referring to the proposal as ' president @entity173 's plan , ' @entity134 said it ' gives the @entity0 broad and unprecedented discretion to micromanage the @entity177			0
' ' this plan gives a @entity29 bureaucracy a blank check to decide how internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the internet backbone			2
' like other @entity135 who oppose net neutrality rules , @entity134 said they would ' open the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband ' that could climb as high as $ 11 billion			1
are @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity7 , @entity83 and others really planning to charge individual companies for faster service ? the major internet service providers insist they have no plans to create such ' fast lanes ' and therefore there is no need for changing the way they are regulated			1
they maintain that blocking or slowing down content would n't be in their best interests			2
but they do think that some companies that use a lot of data , like @entity37 , might need to bear some of the cost of handling the heavy traffic they generate			2
was n't all this debated years ago ? the @entity0 has so far enforced ' open internet ' rules with the @entity214 , which was intended to encourage competition in the telephone and cable industry			2
however , a federal appeals court knocked down that approach			0
president @entity173 and consumer advocates say a better tack would be to apply @entity99 of the @entity223			0
written 80 years ago with radio , telegraph and phone service in mind , that law prohibits companies from charging unreasonable rates or threatening access to services that are critical to society			0
customers of @entity37 , which has produced shows including @entity36 ( pictured ) , could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service so what 's not to like about net neutrality ? internet service providers say they back the concept			1
but they do n't want to face more , costly regulation and claim it would hurt the economy			0
their argument is the internet has been progressing just fine the way it is currently set up , thanks in parts to their expensive investments in network upgrades that have improved the quality of high - speed service and expanded its availability			0
more regulation will cost them more money - money they would otherwise spend on expanding and improving their networks , they say			0
that would have the trickle - down effect of hurting business creation and jobs			0
what will happens now ? it will be a long time before anything materialises			0
@entity37 wo n't stream any faster for you and @entity74 wo n't stop investing in their networks or high speed fiber cables as a result			1
after commissioners make statements , the rules may not be published for a number of weeks			0
the rules will then go under regulatory review for months			0
the vote wo n't be official until , it is estimated , summertime			0
and even then , major telecom companies will challenge new rules in court			0
both those for and against net neutrality see a long road ahead .			1

net neutrality is the principle that internet providers should give consumers access to all content and applications on an equal basis
goal is to prevent providers from creating paid internet ' fast lanes '
it means @entity37 , for instance , ca n't be slowed if it competes with @entity74
some say that by doing this the government will drive up internet bills
other argue that it will ensure the free flow of content on the internet
