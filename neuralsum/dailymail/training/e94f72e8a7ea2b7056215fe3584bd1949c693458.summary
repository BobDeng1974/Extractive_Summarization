in the three months since @entity3 and @entity4 were first paired in the @entity6 semi finals , the increasingly frenzied debate in the divided city of @entity2 has been about whether the ‘ @entity7 ’ still exists			1
and as @entity3 brushed aside their old foes easily 2 - 0 at @entity15 this afternoon - in the first meeting of the teams since april 2012 - the green and white hordes were not slow in informing their rivals in blue that their club ‘ died ’ when liquidation was visited upon @entity14 three years ago			1
yet while they may have been at odds over the ‘ @entity7 ’ issue , by full time in this embarrassingly one - sided encounter , both sets of rival supporters would surely have been united in the view that this @entity4 team is indisputably infirm			2
@entity3 's @entity24 ( centre ) fires in his team 's second goal of the afternoon from outside the 18 - yard box to give @entity3 a 2 - 0 lead commons ( right ) celebrates with team - mates @entity31 and @entity33 ( left ) after scoring to double @entity3 's lead at @entity15 @entity3 supporters do the @entity36 in celebration after going 2 - 0 up against their bitter rivals @entity4 in the @entity7 @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity39 7 ; @entity40 7 ( @entity41 84 ) , @entity42 7 , @entity43 7 , @entity44 7 ; @entity45 7 , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 7 , commons 7 , @entity49 7 ( @entity50 75 ) ; @entity31 7 ( @entity51 68 ) subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 booked : @entity31 , @entity40 goals : @entity31 9 , commons 31 @entity4 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity59 5 ; @entity60 5 , @entity61 5 , @entity62 5 , @entity63 5 ; @entity64 4 ( @entity65 46 ) , black 5 , law 5 , @entity67 5 , @entity68 5 ; @entity69 5 ( @entity70 81 ) subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 booked : @entity67 referee : @entity78 attendance : 50,925 @entity80 : @entity45 a pale shadow of great @entity14 teams of the past , despite the second biggest budget in the land , @entity86 ’s pedestrian and deeply unimpressive side failed to register a shot of any description until a high and wide effort by @entity63 on 71 minutes			1
@entity3 keeper @entity39 had not a single save to make			0
@entity3 , frankly , were streets ahead of @entity4 but settled for first half goals from @entity31 and @entity24 as @entity94 ’s men booked their place against @entity96 in next month ’s final			1
after going ahead , @entity94 ’s men largely played within themselves , to the annoyance of @entity3 fans , who sensed an opportunity to outstrip their biggest - ever win in the fixture : ‘ @entity102 ’ , @entity3 7 @entity4 1 in the @entity103 on october 19 , 1957			1
it was no surprise that this was such a mismatch , though			0
@entity3 lead the @entity106 while @entity4 trail @entity107 by 16 points in the @entity109			1
off the park chaos continues to dog @entity4 , who went into yesterday ’s match with caretaker manager @entity86 still in the dugout despite handing in his notice last month – following in the footsteps of @entity117 who did likewise in november			0
indeed , such is the weakened state of @entity4 that cheers rang out from the @entity3 dressing room when the semi final draw was made			2
everything added up to a comfortable win in @entity94 ’s first @entity113 and that ’s exactly what unfolded here at the @entity129			0
after a cagey start , @entity31 justified his place in the starting line - up over @entity51 – the on - loan @entity133 forward who publicly stated he fancied scoring a hat - trick against @entity4			2
@entity94 had waxed lyrical last week about @entity31 ’ ‘ world class ’ left foot but he used his head here			0
@entity47 floated over a cross from the right , @entity4 defender @entity62 got caught under the ball and @entity31 stooped to silence the @entity4 end			0
commons ' stunning strike secured @entity3 's place in the @entity6 final , where they will face @entity96 on march 15 commons kisses the @entity3 badge as he celebrates in front of a raucous @entity152 support at @entity15 on sunday afternoon a smoke bomb was let off by a @entity3 supporter during the match as they celebrated their team 's performance against @entity4 @entity158 visited both squads last week ahead of this powderkeg tie to urge players to be on their best behaviour but @entity31 ignored them , cupping his ears at the @entity4 fans and picking up a booking			1
chants by @entity3 fans of : “ you ’re not @entity4 anymore ” were immediately replaced by “ can you hear the @entity4 sing ? ” @entity4 had not played a full 90 minutes since january 10 when they won 1 - 0 at @entity169 , and they looked rusty and devoid of any attacking ideas			1
and on the rare occasion they did make it up the park , winger @entity171 wastefully and woefully overhit a corner kick			0
@entity31 leaps above @entity60 ( pictured wearing 23 ) to head in the opening goal in the @entity6 semi-final @entity31 ( near ) spreads his arms wide in celebration , while team - mate @entity49 jumps on his back in front of the @entity3 supporters @entity3 's @entity31 ( left ) celebrates alongside club captain @entity45 after scoring to put the @entity183 1 - 0 up against rivals @entity4 at the other end , @entity49 saw a fierce drive dip narrowly over the crossbar before @entity24 made it 2 - 0			1
@entity188 play on the edge of the @entity4 box by captain @entity45 ended with commons lashing a fierce drive high beyond @entity59 and into the back of the net			0
@entity4 had referee @entity195 to thank when he bizarrely called back play for a foul on @entity45 by @entity197 when @entity31 was haring through on goal			0
and it took a good close - range save from @entity201 to stop @entity47 making it 3 - 0 by the break			0
the second half started with the same @entity3 domination , with @entity31 firing a long - range freekick wide			2
but as the clock ran down , @entity94 ’s men looked increasingly content to sit on their 2 - 0 lead against toothless opponents			0
the last whistle brought confirmation of @entity3 ’s place in the final as they aim for their first @entity6 success since 2009			2
but @entity96 – who knocked out holders @entity218 2 - 1 in saturday ’s semi final – will provide a far stiffer test than @entity4 offered here griffiths cups his ears to the crowd after towering above the @entity4 defence to power home a header in the @entity7 @entity3 players celebrate @entity24 ' spectacular strike , which put them 2 - 0 up against @entity4 and well on their way to a simple victory @entity171 ( right ) breaks away from @entity49 to kick - start a @entity4 attack , but it is eventually thwarted and they were unable to score in a feisty clash at @entity15 , @entity64 ( left ) jumps in to stop the cross of @entity44 , who was playing in @entity3 's back - line @entity31 jumps to head the ball under the challenge of @entity4 ' @entity62 on the way to helping @entity3 to a relatively simple win @entity241 ( third right ) evades the challenge of defenders to head towards the @entity4 goal during the match commons ( left ) fights to win a header against @entity4 ' @entity61 in the @entity6 semi-final at the @entity251 national stadium			1

@entity3 and @entity4 met in an @entity7 for the first time in almost three years
rangers are currently 16 points off the top of the @entity109 , while @entity3 lead the @entity106
@entity31 opened the scoring for @entity94 's side after 10 minutes with a well - placed header
a stunning strike from @entity24 doubled @entity3 's lead just after the half an hour mark
@entity3 *progress* to the @entity6 final , where they will face @entity96 at @entity15 in march
