by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:16 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 04:00 est , 14 january 2014 children as young as 15 are to be allowed to watch films filled with obscene language			1
swear words are now so ‘ commonplace ’ among teenagers that age ratings will be relaxed , censors said yesterday			2
the @entity10 claims parents accept it is ‘ game over ’ when protecting their children from bad language			1
controversy : the woman in @entity17 , starring @entity18 , received more complaints than any other film in the past four years , according to the @entity10 under the new rules , even 12 - year - olds could potentially be exposed to more profanities			1
children ’s charities , parents ’ groups and politicians reacted angrily to the move , which they said amounted to a free - for - all			2
‘ it is truly outrageous – parents and children are being let down by a regulator who is no longer interested in regulating , ’ said @entity30 , of the charity @entity31			2
@entity37 , of the family group @entity38 , asked : ‘ if no standards are set by adults , what chance do our children have of being polite and decent grown - ups and parents ? ’ updating its guidance for cinema films and dvds , the @entity10 said from february 24 it would be ‘ more flexible about allowing very strong language at 15 ’			1
language : more than 50 parents said that the swearing and sexual innuendo of @entity55 meant that it should not have been rated @entity56 an accompanying report insisted there was evidence of a softening of attitudes toward the most offensive words , ‘ especially among younger respondents ’			1
the board ’s researchers sought the opinions of 10,000 people including , for the first time , 1,040 children aged 13 to 18			0
previously , films classified as suitable for 15 - year - olds were not permitted to ‘ endorse discriminatory language or behaviour ’			1
while strong language was banned , ‘ aggressive or repeated use of the strongest language ’ was unlikely to be allowed			1
now , however , the guidance states that ‘ there may be racist , homophobic or other discriminatory themes and language ’			0
it adds that very strong language may be permitted depending on the context			0
it said : ‘ reluctantly , parents were accepting that there have been shifts in language in recent years and awareness and use of the word “ f * * * ” in particular , is almost commonplace , even for primary school aged children			2
‘ even if their own children are not using language at home , parents are aware that it has become an accepted part of young people ’s lives and its use in the school playground as well as with social media , mobile phones and the internet is widespread			2
’ it said that especially among boys of 14 and 15 years the c - word ‘ was seen to be part of their vernacular ’			0
films rated @entity10 – which can be viewed by younger children if accompanied by an adult – have always allowed ‘ moderate language ’ and ‘ infrequent ’ strong language			1
now , guidance states that ‘ strong language may be permitted ’ even if frequent , with certain conditions on whether it is justified by its context			0
the research report accompanying the guidance states : ‘ by aged 15 , most parents argued that it was “ game over ” and they could no longer control their child ’s viewing			0
' the shock value of bad language is felt to be diminishing with each generation			1
’ but last night @entity128 , a @entity129 mp on the @entity130 , said : ‘ this reflects the general decline in good behavioural standards			0
‘ it makes children think it ’s perfectly normal and reasonable to use bad language			1
i would rather they were n’t exposed to even worse levels of swearing			0
‘ they are still children at 15 and are already exposed to things in films at a younger age than i would care for them to be exposed to			0
‘ i would like to think that people would want to bring up their children to know that that is n’t acceptable			0
’ mrs @entity30 added : ‘ everyone except the @entity10 and broadcast media knows children will copy the swearing they hear			1
‘ films make it cool			0
we dread to think what this latest announcement will mean for films deemed acceptable by the @entity10 – an industry - funded body – for our children			1
’ @entity158 of @entity159 said : ‘ swearing is not tolerated anywhere else in life – kids ca n’t do it at school , you ca n’t do it in public			2
' so it is quite extraordinary that they ’re just saying “ well , it ’s a free - for - all in 15 - rated films ”			0
' there is this idea that you just have to accept obscene language because we ’ve got an evolving contemporary society and that ’s just how it is			0
but , actually , no we do n’t			0
’ obscene : @entity179 on @entity180 contains 506 f - words in under three hours mrs @entity37 said : ‘ films and internet have done much to lower the tone and values of society			0
‘ we must remember young adults are the next generation of young parents			0
’ the new guidelines offer a subtle but significant shift – stating discriminatory language is ‘ unlikely ’ to be acceptable and that dangerous behaviour ‘ must be clearly disapproved of ’ if shown			2
there will be a crackdown , however , on words such as ‘ crap ’ which parents complained about hearing in films including the animated feature , the @entity203 ! in an adventure with scientists ! greater attention will now be paid by censors to horror movies and the psychological impact they can have on children , and to the sexualisation of girls , the content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn			1
@entity218 , director of the @entity10 , said : ‘ regular public consultation is crucial to continued public trust in what we do			1
‘ our new classification guidelines reflect explicitly concerns raised by the public during the 2013 consultation and will , i believe , ensure that we continue to be in step with what the public wants and expects in order to make sensible and informed viewing decisions			1
‘ there is also room for continued improvement			0
’ the @entity10 has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the @entity237			2
videos made featuring artists such as @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 could be targeted following the large - scale public consultation			1
the body said there are ‘ special worries ’ about sexual content in music videos			1
the vow to crack down on the videos came as the @entity10 released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch			1
in its report it noted : ‘ a specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content , where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls , and pornography			1
‘ the content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries			0
’ it also said the ‘ sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern ’			0
‘ music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery , which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls ’ emotional wellbeing and social development , ’ the report said			2
‘ the overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity			0

films aimed at teenagers will be allowed to feature more bad language under new guidelines *unveiled* by the @entity10
