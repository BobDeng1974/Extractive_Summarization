finding people more attractive after a few drinks has long been known as the ' beer goggle ' effect - but experts are divided about whether this phenomenon actually exists			2
to put it to the test , researchers from @entity6 conducted lab experiments to gauge whether drink changed people 's perceptions of what is attractive			1
volunteers were asked to look at photos of men , women and landscapes before and after drinking - and in every category alcohol affected their perceptions			1
researchers conducted lab tests to gauge whether drink changed people 's perceptions of what is attractive			1
volunteers drank either an alcoholic or non-alcoholic , placebo drink before being shown images of 20 male faces , 20 female faces and 20 landscapes			1
stock image pictured the @entity37 study 's findings contradict previous research from @entity39 that found alcohol closes down the part of the brain that stops people acting on impulses			2
this area shuts down long before the drink deadens the so - called ‘ reptilian ’ part responsible for our sexual urges , said dr @entity50			0
the area of the brain that makes us want to mate is the oldest part - and sited so far down it keeps functioning , however much we drink - until we are ready to pass out			0
this suggests the ' @entity58 ' effect is less to do with the level of attractiveness , and more to do with a lack of restraint and decision - making skills			0
the volunteers were divided into two groups - one group drank just one alcoholic drink , while the other drank a non-alcoholic placebo drink			1
among the images there were 20 male faces , 20 female faces and 20 landscapes			1
researchers from the @entity37 's @entity74 ( @entity74 ) said attractiveness ratings were higher for all three image types among the alcohol group compared to the placebo group			1
the study leaders said this confirmed the beer goggle hypothesis , which claims people become more attractive to the opposite sex after a few drinks			0
now the @entity37 team is extending the research into the more realistic setting of a pub. it is conducting tests over four nights at three pubs in @entity37 : the @entity93 , the @entity94 and the @entity95			2
researcher @entity96 said : ' it 's a bit of fun , but there is a serious message			0
' if alcohol does change perceptions of attractiveness then that could be a factor in the kind of risky behaviour you see when people are drunk , such as unprotected sex			2
' attractiveness ratings were higher for all three image types among the alcohol group compared to the placebo group			1
the study leaders said this confirmed the beer goggle hypothesis , which claims people become more attractive to the opposite sex after a few drinks , and less so when they 're sober again			0
