the telesales worker shares her story on @entity18 show my @entity19 as cameras follow her for a year on her weightloss journey			0
she then gained 50lb ( more than 3st ) carrying each of her children till she eventually tipped the scales at 38st			1
she said : ' i wish i had been taught that food is fuel , that it 's what you put in your body to make it go			2
i do n't eat for fuel but for enjoyment			2
i have a relationship with food			2
when it tastes good it takes me to a happy place			0
' when i did n't have friends or family there for me , food was			1
it does n't hurt you emotionally even though it does physically			2
' she admitted her love of food was ruining her life - and that of her three teenagers and her eight - year - old daughter			1
goal : @entity8 is eventually approved for gastric bypass surgery fast food addicts : she hopes the operation will help her lose weight as she and her family do n't eat well ' when you 're this big it effects everything , ' she said			1
' it hurts to move it hurts to walk			0

she said : ' his weight killed him			2
he was over 600lb and his kidney were n't functioning			0
his health got worse and worse			0
on some days he could n't even get out of bed and was n't living life at all			0
' one day his heart stopped beating and they could n't restart it			0
i do n't think that i 'm far behind him			0
i wo n't be here soon if i do n't make a change			1
' drastic action : @entity8 lost her husband because he was obese and does n't want to die young like him no excuses : dr @entity119 tells her that in order for the surgery to work , she needs to commit to exercising and healthy eating @entity8 believes the answer is to have gastric bypass surgery and she 's so determined to get it , she moves her family 800 miles to @entity128 , @entity129 , to be near @entity119 who she hopes will approve her for the operation			1
the doctor tells @entity8 that first she has to make lifestyle changes and she wo n't be allowed to have surgery until she has proved this by losing some weight			1
@entity8 is adamant that she can do it - but on her return visit a month later she has gained a more than a stone			1
she explained that it 's too hard to eat foods dr @entity119 recommended			0
she blamed her weight gain on fluid in her legs , her sedentary state working at a computer eight hours a day and only being able to eat fast food when travelling between @entity10 and @entity128 to visit extended family			1
she said : ' i know i eat too many carbs and i do n't exercise			1
my family and i have been eating fast foods our whole lives			1
it 's going to hard to change all these habits			0

i know i 'm eating foods i should n't be but finding foods the doctor is ok with is difficult			0
' difficult : at first she struggles to stop eating junk food because she enjoys the taste and ca n't find healthy food at drive - thrus dr @entity119 tells @entity8 to stick to a liquid diet of soup and yoghurt for a month			1
' you need to stop making excuses or surgery will never work			0
you clearly have an eating disorder , ' he told her			0
' i can not approve your surgery until you have lost some weight			1
' the liquid diet works and on her next visit , @entity8 is @entity191 lighter and approved for surgery			1
