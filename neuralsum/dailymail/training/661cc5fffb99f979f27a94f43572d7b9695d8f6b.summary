video from the scene showed the friday intruder , @entity10 , sprinting across the lawn as @entity9 agents shouted at nearby pedestrians to clear the area			1
' this situation was a little different than other incidents we have at the @entity2 , ' @entity321 said			2
' this incident is the most shocking example yet of how dangerously lax the @entity9 has become , failing at its most basic job — to protect the president and first family in the @entity2 , ' said @entity86 insider @entity330 , who 's written several books on the @entity9			2
he added to @entity26 : ' because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by management of " we make do with less , " the @entity9 is not protecting the @entity2 with adequate agents and uniformed officers and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting intruders and weapons of mass destruction ' @entity330 — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about @entity9 agents hiring prostitutes in @entity344 — said it 's ' arrogance ' that the @entity2 does n't even have a front door lock			1
' if the intruder were carrying chemical , biological or radiological weapons and president @entity57 and his family had been in , we would have had a dead president as well as a dead first family , ' said @entity330 , who authored ' @entity355 : secret service agents reveal the @entity357 of the presidents			0
