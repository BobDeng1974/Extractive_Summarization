celebrities who live in the area include football manager @entity116 , his son @entity116 and cricketer @entity116			0
in september , the @entity118 reported how research suggested £ 80million worth of property was either for sale or had changed hands in recent months on the peninsula			0
the figure remarkably referred to only 15 homes			0
the resort ’s exclusivity is borne out by the fact that many houses are sold , only to be demolished immediately to make way for new buildings that make the most of every last square inch of their plot			0
thus , modest @entity137 bungalows have been redeveloped into striking glass - and - concrete mansions			0
there are only 70 or so homes around the edge of the peninsula , making a location with sea frontage the most sought - after — and the 40 or so houses that have direct water access to @entity147 go for a serious premium .			0
