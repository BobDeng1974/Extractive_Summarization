things got very steamy this morning at the today show studios when host @entity2 and tv personality @entity3 took part in new charity dare the @entity6 live on air , and shared a passionate - if very one - sided - kiss			1
@entity2 , 50 , looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when @entity3 , 83 , energetically took the lead on the act ; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one @entity13 , place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle			1
when @entity2 's quick peck on @entity3 ' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former @entity25 co-host , he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch , as @entity2 froze up in surprise			2
once the concept , which aims to raise awareness for autism , was explained to @entity3 during his guest segment on the show this morning , he enthusiastically asked : ' are we going to kiss ? ' ' i 'm not sure , ' responded @entity2 , before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray			2
' let me look at your lips , ' @entity3 exclaimed , leaning in			0
' she could swallow me ! i 've never seen lips like that			0
honest to @entity62 , something 's going to happen			0
' and indeed it did			0
@entity2 nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached @entity3 ' lips , before issuing him a conservative peck			2
too much ? today host @entity2 , 50 , ( right ) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning 's @entity6 , when former co-host @entity3 , 83 , ( left ) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker not finished : @entity2 gave @entity3 a quick peck , before jerking her head away from him @entity3 then launched in for a full - on smooch , as @entity2 darted her head away , only for @entity3 to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth - to - mouth smacker			1
' boy you look like you went in there ! ' squealed @entity43 , as @entity2 recovered in stunned silence			0
' it was pretty good , ' attested @entity3 , lipstick smeared over his face			0
' you got a boyfriend ? ' much like the now - infamous @entity33 , those who fail to complete the @entity13 test after being nominated have to donate to @entity35 - based charity @entity87			1
last week at the @entity25 studios , @entity42 and @entity43 were nominated by fellow today correspondent @entity89			1
@entity89 explained that she first took the challenge with today co-anchor @entity91 the previous week on her talk show and later donated $ 5,000 to support autism programs nationwide			0
get away ! @entity2 tried to push @entity3 away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further recovery : @entity2 was visibly shaken after the amorous display , which took place live on air ' this is clearly a transparent attempt by @entity89 once gain to make out with her colleague , ' @entity91 joked on the morning show			0
@entity89 immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge @entity42 , but remained coy about who his partner would be			1
' is there anybody around that we can ask ? ' @entity91 said			0
@entity109 , who was sitting next to @entity42 , quickly left her chair			0
' i am willing to get up out of this seat , ' she said as she made room for @entity42 's partner			0
when @entity43 walked on stage , @entity42 enthusiastically told her : ' get over here			1
' panic : ironically , it was @entity3 who was most concerned about the challenge before it began , telling @entity2 that he was worried she would ' swallow him ' because of the size of her lips @entity43 joked to @entity42 : ' your world is going to be on fire			1
' ' this is nothing compared to what goes on in the make - up room , ' she added			0
as @entity43 and @entity42 sat face to face , they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause			1
' and then we get to challenge somebody , ' @entity42 explained			2
@entity43 stared at @entity42 with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the @entity13 that was in her mouth , quickly moving towards her partner			1
' really aggressive , ' @entity91 commented from the sidelines			0
follow the leader : @entity2 and @entity3 were officially challenged to take on the @entity6 by today hosts @entity42 and @entity43 , who themselves took part last week ( pictured ) @entity42 pulled away as @entity43 's lips brushed his , only to move back into to give her another kiss			1
' i love you anyway , ' he said			0
' i would have done that for nothing			0
' someone else joked : ' @entity150 and whose the @entity151 ? ' after their epic kiss , @entity43 nominated her former co-host @entity3 and her current co-star @entity2 for the @entity6			1
after their epic kiss , @entity43 nominated @entity3 and @entity2 for the @entity6			1
but @entity42 had a different pairing in mind , noting that the cast of @entity160 would be on the show on monday			0
fun moment : @entity2 's fellow today show hosts @entity91 and @entity89 took the @entity6 on her talk show new nominees : daily mail online editor - at - large @entity167 and @entity168 also took the challenge on @entity171 ' i 'm available , ' @entity109 said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned			1
@entity42 ultimately chose actors @entity174 and @entity176 to take on the challenge			2
' if @entity176 needs an understudy for that @entity6 with @entity174 , i am available , ' @entity178 reminded @entity42 again			1
the @entity6 started earlier this month at @entity181 's @entity180 benefit for autism , which was hosted by @entity183			2
when someone on @entity185 dared @entity91 and @entity186 is the new black star @entity187 to have a @entity151 moment with licorice in exchange for a donation , the @entity6 was born			2
@entity171 co-hosts @entity192 and @entity194 also took up the same candy - based encounter on their show last friday before nominating @entity197 editor - at - large @entity167 and his fellow guest @entity168 to do the same			1
' i got to say that was really enjoyable , ' @entity167 said after they completed the challenge .			2
