the group stage is over , and it 's as good a time as any to take a breather and reflect on what we have seen so far at the @entity5			1
16 of the 32 teams that began in @entity7 just over two weeks ago have exited stage left , with world champions @entity10 , @entity12 's @entity11 and perennially underwhelming @entity13 those to have already fallen			2
and for every shock knockout , there 's been an even more surprising progression			0
@entity18 managed to make it through a group featuring @entity21 , @entity13 and @entity22 , @entity17 snuck through with just two goals in the ' for ' column and @entity25 made it past @entity28 's @entity27 to qualify from the group stage for the first time in their history			1
it took the magic of @entity62 to beat him			1
@entity36 verdict : has made 18 saves , more than any other goalkeeper in the tournament			0
stopper : @entity49 has been a rock in goal @entity71 - @entity70 the little general has been a rock in the heart of @entity70 's defence			0
his towering display during @entity70 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity10 was simply marvellous			0
@entity36 verdict : 28 clearances and a 93 % pass completion for the diminutive @entity82 defender ( from 207 passes )			0
little general : @entity71 has been superb at the back for @entity70 so far @entity87 - @entity86 the veteran defender has been masterful at the back as @entity86 won all three of their @entity90 games			2
tough defending was required with all their victories coming by just a single goal			0
@entity36 verdict : no player made more blocks than @entity87 in the group stage ( 5 )			1
@entity99 : @entity87 goes up for a header against @entity101 forward @entity102 @entity104 - @entity103 captaining your country at four @entity107 should be enough , but it also helped that @entity104 was superb in his role at the heart of defence in all three games			0
@entity103 conceded just the one goal in three games , and managed to keep @entity43 and @entity7 at bay			1
@entity36 verdict : veteran @entity104 has netted a goal for @entity103 in each of the last three @entity107			0
captain marvel : @entity104 is captaining @entity103 at his fourth @entity5 per @entity118 to think that at @entity120 two years ago @entity119 was n't even in the @entity118 side			1
a superb presence in defence alongside @entity124			0
@entity36 verdict : of all defenders to feature in the group stages , only @entity71 ( 207 ) attempted more passes than @entity119 ( 202 )			0
@entity119 : per @entity119 has been excellent has @entity118 qualified from @entity129 @entity131 - @entity130 quite possibly the standout player of the tournament so far			2
has been at the heart of everything good @entity130 have done during their 100 % group stage record , scoring three times in the process			1
@entity36 verdict : has scored or assisted a goal every 45 minutes on average , the best rate of any player to play more than 100 minutes at this tournament			0
spark : @entity131 has been superb in a central role for @entity130 @entity148 - @entity130 freed on the wing by @entity152 's decision to start the @entity5 with just a single striker , @entity149 has been an electric creative presence so far as @entity130 dominated @entity155 @entity36 verdict : has already provided three assists , the joint-most with @entity160 's @entity159			1
electric : @entity148 pace has been a virtue for @entity130 @entity163 - @entity160 the new fastest man in the world - or at least in the football world - @entity163 's performance against @entity10 in their opening game will be remembered for a long time			2
@entity36 verdict : after scoring once in 2006 and twice in 2010 , has already netted three goals in the 2014 tournament ( plus one assist ) sprinter : @entity163 scored three times as @entity160 topped @entity175 @entity177 - @entity176 @entity177 has led the line superbly for @entity176 , keeping @entity179 out out of the team for two of their games and scoring three goals			1
how it is still only three , mind , only he will know			0
@entity36 verdict : created 12 goalscoring chances ( including assists ) , the joint-most with @entity191 , plus he has netted three times			0
finisher : @entity177 led the line as @entity176 dominated @entity194 @entity62 - @entity55 it 's hard to say anything about @entity62 that has n't already been said			2
so best to keep it simple : four goals so far , all of them superb , all of them vital			0
@entity36 verdict : has scored three goals from outside the box , two more than any other player			2
maestro : @entity62 has scored four times in three games as @entity55 cruised through to the second phase @entity43 - @entity7 the poster boy of @entity7 and the man with the weight of a nation on his shoulders			1
@entity43 could so easily have crumbled , but he has n't even come close yet			2
four goals so far , and you 'd imagine there are plenty more to come			0
@entity36 verdict : four goal hero @entity43 has the best conversion rate of any player to have attempted at least eight shots ( 44.44 % )			2
poster boy : @entity7 's golden boy has rised to the plate , scoring four times during the group stage substitutes @entity229 - @entity228 @entity36 verdict : his saves to shots rate of 85 % is second only to @entity48 's @entity49			1
@entity234 - @entity27 @entity36 verdict : made more headed clearances than any other player in the group stage ( 30 )			1
@entity239 - @entity238 @entity36 verdict : scored the first entirely left - footed hat - trick at a @entity5 ( 1966 - 2014 )			1
@entity241 - @entity118 @entity36 verdict : has scored nine goals in his first nine @entity5 games , matching @entity246 's achievement .			1
