by @entity0 @entity1 is ready to pitch @entity2 into @entity4 action alongside his fellow @entity5 next tuesday night as the club begin their bid to land a £ 15million group stage bounty			1
the @entity10 manager watched @entity11 and @entity12 come through their first 90 minutes of pre-season as his side closed their @entity17 tour with a stalemate against @entity19 in @entity20			1
centre - back @entity2 has yet to play under @entity1 after he reported directly back to @entity22 following @entity24 ’s second - round exit in @entity25			1
in charge : @entity27 manager @entity1 ( left ) stands alongside assistant @entity28 in the dugout back from @entity25 : @entity2 ( right ) has returned to @entity22 following @entity24 's @entity5 last - 16 exit @entity27 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity11 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity12 ; @entity34 ( @entity35 70 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 70 ) , commons , @entity40 ; @entity41 ( @entity42 77 )			1
substitutes : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48			0
his condition will be assessed at @entity50 tomorrow but @entity1 believes he is more than capable of being involved in the first leg of their opening qualifier against @entity54 in @entity55			1
@entity11 has been attracting interest from @entity57 and @entity58 , but the @entity60 manager reported no news in terms of ins or outs from his squad			1
‘ @entity11 and @entity12 are quality players , you can see it , ’ said @entity1 , as he reflected on the @entity67 friendly before @entity27 fly back to @entity68			1
‘ this was a good match for both of them			0
i can understand that @entity11 is an attractive goalkeeper			1
he made saves and he played well with his feet as well today			0
it was good to see			0
on the ball : @entity27 's @entity41 ( left ) is closed down by @entity19 's @entity80 not letting go : @entity27 's @entity37 finds himself under pressure from @entity82 ( right ) ‘ of course , he can give the team a lift			1
we need all our quality players			0
‘ this 90 minutes has to be enough for them ahead of @entity54			1
that ’s how it is			0
‘ for @entity12 it wo n’t be a problem because he played in the @entity5			1
it was important that @entity11 played in this game but he has been training well and i think he is ready			1
‘ @entity95 will join up with the squad on sunday and we will see how he is but he will be in the squad for the game against @entity54			2
‘ he also played four matches in the @entity5 and that is important			2
i would have no hesitation about throwing him in			0
he is a quality player and we need all the quality we have			0
’ @entity27 departed @entity17 with two wins and two draws from their four run - outs , but the real value for @entity1 was in building a relationship with his players at their training base in @entity110			1
he is confident the fruits of that labour will be seen in @entity54			2
strike : @entity27 's @entity12 sees his effort on goal saved by the @entity19 goalkeeper snap happy : @entity12 poses for a photo with a young @entity27 fan at full - time ‘ i think we have prepared for the qualifiers as well as we could do , ’ he said			1
‘ we have not had that many days together , but this training camp was very important			0
i got to know the players and they got to know me			0
we will have a good team on tuesday			0
‘ the game against @entity67 was one against a good opponent			0
i think the performance was one step forward from @entity129 last sunday			0
‘ of course , there is still a long way to go but we finished this game strongly and that was a positive for us			0
‘ we have to be ready for the @entity134 matches			0
i ’m looking forward to the game against @entity54			2
’ @entity27 famously defeated @entity67 in the @entity4 semi-final en route to their 1967 glory in @entity138 , but this reunion was a distinctly forgettable affair			1
back to business : @entity27 's @entity11 makes his first appearance since returning from the @entity5 miss : @entity27 's @entity38 has his shot easily saved during the 0 - 0 draw in @entity17 @entity1 ’s side wove some pretty passing patterns in the first half but too often the little triangles were in front of a defence which was quite happy to sit in			1
the greater attacking threat came from the @entity153 when they broke forward			0
@entity11 had already saved from @entity155 when a loose touch from @entity157 in central midfeld suddenly left his defence exposed			2
@entity160 was played through but could n’t get his drive on target			0
shortly afterwards , @entity11 did well to spread himself in front of the same player as he tried to dink a shot into the net			2
the lack of wide options available to @entity1 was underlined by @entity40 being shifted to a left wing role , with @entity37 operating on the right			2
challenge : @entity27 's @entity36 ( left ) wins the ball as he tackles @entity82 charging through : striker @entity42 causes problems for @entity82 ( left ) and @entity174 ( right ) getting in behind @entity67 was proving decidedly tricky , but an overlapping @entity12 managed to do so before drilling in a low cross that was only half - cleared			1
@entity41 seized upon the loose ball but his strike was directly at goalkeeper @entity179			0
the format remained largely the same after the break , albeit that @entity27 were less troubled defensively			2
a breakthrough very nearly arrived when young centre - back @entity33 picked out @entity41 with a lob forward			0
the @entity186 striker ’s control was good but @entity187 reacted well to parry away the angled shot			0
receiving orders : @entity42 ( left ) is given some tactical advice by @entity27 captain @entity191 sidelined : injured @entity191 ( left ) looks on from the dugout during the friendly in @entity194 @entity195 then tried to catch out the @entity196 with a thump from distance , before @entity12 saw a near - post drive blocked after neat interplay with substitute @entity42			2
ultimately , though , the match meandered to a stalemate that meant @entity27 remain so far unbeaten in @entity1 ’s short tenure			1
the first real test , of course , will come in @entity55 next week			2
happy to be here : new @entity27 goalkeeper @entity207 watches the action from the stands duty calls : @entity27 chief executive @entity211 enjoys a phone call prior to kick - off			1

@entity1 believes @entity2 is more than capable of playing in @entity27 's opening @entity4 qualifier
