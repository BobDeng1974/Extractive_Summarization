by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 09:51 est , 6 december 2012 a mystery lottery player has lost out on a £ 64m fortune after the deadline to claim the prize expired and the money was handed to charity			1
the unlucky individual , who bought the winning @entity9 ticket in @entity10 on june 8th , had until 11pm yesterday to collect the massive windfall			1
but despite a @entity13 publicity campaign , the would - be multi-millionaire missed the 180 - day deadline - making the £ 63,837,543.60 prize the biggest unclaimed lottery win in history and the biggest ever windfall for the @entity19 fund			1
@entity37 runs the @entity37 project which provides young disabled people with local fun and friendship clubs and camps across @entity43 , spaces to learn new skills and build confidence , as well as access to tailored work placements			0
@entity48 , a community drumming group in @entity50 is making a life - changing difference to the lives of its members			0
@entity55 works with service personnel returning from active service from all conflicts , by providing special therapeutic surfing sessions to help them get back to community life			0
@entity61 - the @entity63 - based service offers emergency safe and temporary accommodation to women suffering from domestic violence , and their children			0
@entity69 – this group enhances the lives of people with disabilities and others who are disadvantaged			0
the @entity76 ( @entity10 ) this group helps deaf children and their families to communicate , enabling the child to fully integrate into their home life and social community			0
' the vast majority of prizes are claimed within the 180 days but to avoid this unfortunate situation happening again , we would urge all @entity13 players to check their tickets on a regular basis			0
' the distribution of the money will be the responsibility of 13 lottery distribution bodies across the country			1
@entity96 , and charitable causes will receive the lion 's share of the winnings , at 40 per cent			0
sports , @entity99 will each receive 20 per cent			0
@entity101 , a spokesman for @entity102 , said : ' countless good causes will benefit from this unclaimed prize			1
' @entity13 players should be proud that they are helping so many good causes in their own area			1
” ' in theory , the £ 64 million unclaimed prize would fund over 6,000 minibuses to help kids with disabilities			1
' the £ 64 million would also fund the improvement of approximately 7,800 play areas for children across the @entity116 and build over 1,000 village halls / community centres across the @entity116 '			1
@entity13 officials launched a desperate search for the holder , raising awareness through adverts and posters - with even a town crier proclaiming the win from a @entity127			1
all lottery players were urged to check their tickets and search some of the more unusual places where “ lost ” tickets have been found in the past , such as in bin bags , wedged down the back of sofas and stashed in car sun visors			2
the lottery spokeswoman added : ' we tried very hard to find the ticket - holder , with lots of awareness - raising activity over the past 180 days , and it ’s a real shame that they have missed out , but there is still one winner - the nation			1
in 2001 @entity146 , a purchasing manager from @entity147 , missed out on a jackpot of £ 3,011,065 after losing his ticket			1
using computer records , he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but @entity152 refused to pay out — since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune			2
the decision sparked a national furore , with even the then prime minister @entity160 championing mr @entity146 ’s cause — but all in vain			0
the prize money would have allowed the winner to buy 339 houses at the average @entity26 price of £ 190,000 or — should the urge take them — more than two million bottles of champagne			1
it would also have made them a good deal richer than the commuter town ’s most glamorous son , @entity176 driver @entity174 ( who is worth a reported £ 55 million ) , and almost three times wealthier than local @entity180 star @entity179 ( worth a relatively paltry £ 24 million )			1
in 2004 , £ 7 million went unclaimed in @entity181 , and in september 2007 a £ 6.9 million win was n’t claimed in @entity183			1
winner : past @entity26 lottery winners include @entity186 pictured celebrating with her son @entity187 at @entity188 in 2005 loser : @entity146 , from @entity147 , missed out on a £ 3million jackpot when he did n't claim a lottery win in time yesterday a drawing by @entity195 artist @entity193 fetched a record £ 29 million at auction - a price that would leave the ticket holder with plenty of cash left in their pocket			1
a @entity205 plane if their art tastes are more modern , @entity207 ’s diamond - encrusted skull is worth £ 50 million			2
60 @entity210 a five - bedroom house in @entity213 , @entity214 , with a labyrinth of subterranean rooms , including a ballroom , swimming pool and gym - a snip at £ 16 million			2
7,000 @entity221 watches a @entity223 yacht in the @entity224 might cost £ 4.75 million 90,000 pairs of @entity227 shoes pay the wages bill for @entity230 ’s first team for a season 500,000 bottles of 2002 @entity233 200 until now the largest unclaimed sum is £ 9.4 million , on a ticket that was bought in @entity236 in july 2005			1
@entity152 ’s @entity237 says : ‘ we all want winners to get their money but there must be a deadline			0
otherwise every prize would just go on indefinitely			2
but this way billions of pounds have gone to good causes over the years — from funding the @entity246 through bodies like @entity43 to local playgroups and @entity250 clubs			2
’ still , the psychological fallout of a near miss can be devastating			0
after mr @entity146 was denied his millions he plunged into depression , separated from his partner and moved to @entity256 , where he joined an evangelical cult			0
he has since returned and , claiming to have found happiness , written a book about his ordeal			0
residents in @entity26 can readily imagine the pain of losing a winning ticket			2
@entity264 , 56 , a human resources manager , says : ‘ can you imagine ? it would be awful			0
it ’s money that could completely change your life			0
if that were me , i ’d feel sick			0
’ of course , the treasure hunt would not be needed if @entity152 revealed the precise place where the winning ticket was sold			2
purchasing records mean that they can easily identify the shop — but the company ’s licence forbids it from making that information public in order to maximise the winner ’s chances of anonymity			0
watch the hunt for the lottery loser			1
