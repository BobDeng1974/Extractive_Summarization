teachers are to get a pay rise of up to 2 per cent , ministers are set to announce tomorrow amid claims of a major coalition dispute			1
@entity5 tonight accused the @entity6 of trying to block the rise in a ' fierce ' row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in @entity13 and @entity14			1
but education secretary @entity15 insisted the salary increase would go ahead as planned			1
at present maximum pay in @entity13 and @entity14 outside of @entity32 is £ 32,187 , with the minimum rate set at £ 22,023			1
@entity34 this week denied there was a coalition dispute over the issue , insisting it was ' being dealt with in the normal way ' by @entity40 treasury minister @entity39			0
but mr @entity5 accused the chancellor of blocking the plan			1
he told @entity43 : ' it 's important that where we can be as generous as we can be … for people who are working in the public sector , we should do so			2
' he stressed that it was important to be ' responsible with the public finances ' but insisted that the teachers ' pay rise could be funded			2
deputy prime minister @entity5 revealed details of a ' fierce ' coalition row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in @entity13 and @entity14 speaking this afternoon he said : ' there 's quite a fierce debate going on in government right now about what we do for the recommendations for teachers			1
' the recommendation is that for some teachers , it depends where they are on their pay band , they get a 2 per cent increase			0
' that 's being resisted by @entity72			0
i just think it 's affordable , it would n't cost us the earth , it 's recommended and we should get on and do it			0
' he admitted that at a time of ongoing austerity the money ' has to be found from somewhere ' , but said next week 's @entity83 would focus on raising more in tax from ' people who have got the means to chip in a bit of extra '			0
however , the @entity6 hit back insisting there was not row and the deal was agreed this evening			0
mrs @entity90 told the @entity91 : ' this country is lucky to have a truly exceptional teaching workforce who do a vital job of opening up young minds			1
that 's i 'm delighted to approve a pay deal today which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise , something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff			2
' the pay review body believes that the rise for teachers could be made from within existing school budgets , meaning no additional cost to the taxpayer from central government			1
chancellor @entity72 is accused of resisting a 2 per cent pay rise for teachers , something the @entity6 denied tonight the @entity121 teaching union has warned teaching is already a far less attractive career choice after a series of coalition pay freezes and caps			1
it urged the pay body to recommend a ' substantial above - inflation pay rise '			2
general secretary @entity130 said : ' the cuts to teachers ' pay has been a major contributory factor in the current teacher recruitment and retention crisis			0
' many teachers did n't even get the 1 per cent awarded in 2014 thanks to the excessive discretion schools have been given over teachers ' pay			0
' that is the context in which the argument over 1 per cent or 2 per cent is apparently taking place			0
it does n't even scratch the surface of what teachers have lost at the hands of this coalition			0
