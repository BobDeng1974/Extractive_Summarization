by @entity0 published : 02:05 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 02:06 est , 14 december 2013 the polygamist family stars of tv show @entity2 have won a legal victory after a federal judge ruled on friday that key parts of @entity7 's polygamy laws are unconstitutional			1
@entity2 and his four wives had fled @entity7 for @entity9 last year , under the threat of prosecution			1
but yesterday , @entity13 district court judge @entity12 said in the ruling that the phrase in @entity7 law that forbids cohabitation with another person was a violation of the @entity20			1
relieved : @entity2 with his sister wives , from left , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , had fled @entity7 fearing prosecution attorney @entity28 has said that the @entity2 family had drawn the attention of @entity7 authorities because of their @entity33 hit series			1
the family filed their lawsuit in july 2011 , before leaving for @entity9 last year			1
mr @entity28 , who is based in @entity37 , argued the case before @entity39 in january			0
@entity7 's bigamy law is stricter than the laws in 49 other states - most of which prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses			1
@entity7 makes it illegal to even purport to be married to multiple partners or live together			0
the @entity48 reported that @entity39 took a narrow interpretation of the words ' marry ' and ' purports to marry ' in his ruling			0
that means that bigamy remains illegal in @entity7 only in the literal sense , such as when someone fraudulently acquires more than one marriage license			0
acceptance : @entity2 , seen here with his children , welcomed the ruling stars : @entity2 , pictured here with two of his wives ' mothers and his own mom , features in the hit @entity33 show ' the decision affects a far greater range of such relationships than the form of polygamy practiced by the @entity73 , ' mr @entity28 said on friday			1
' it is a victory not for polygamy but privacy in @entity13			0
' @entity7 officials had sought to have the suit thrown out			0
they first argued that the @entity73 could n't challenge the bigamy law because they had n't been charged			2
state attorneys later argued for dismissal because a prosecutor had pledged not to prosecute them for bigamy			2
but judge @entity12 wrote in a 2012 ruling that the promise from the @entity86 appeared to be a ploy to avoid the suit			2
mr @entity2 said in a statement yesterday that the family was ' humbled and grateful ' for the ruling			2
' while we know that many people do not approve of plural families , it is our family and based on our beliefs , ' he said			0
' just as we respect the personal and religious choices of other families , we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices			0
