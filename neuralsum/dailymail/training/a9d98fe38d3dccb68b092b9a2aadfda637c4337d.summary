it states : ‘ with the proliferation of internet - enabled mobile devices , like smartphones and tablets , and an exponential increase in data consumption , consumers can find themselves facing bills that far exceed the amounts they expect			1
we expect mobile operators to develop and use a consistent approach to limit bill shock			2
‘ we will encourage them to adopt the measures set out by @entity127 , including : the introduction of text alerts to advise people when they approach their call limit and notification of the costs of making further calls ; the promotion of account management tools to enable customers to track their usage easily ; and information about other steps that people can take to help themselves			2
