the father , along with the girl 's mother , placed the child into a black holdall bag along with a silver chain blessed by the @entity23 and a note			1
@entity0 then left her outside the priest 's home at the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , on a ' chilly ' night last year , a judge was told			1
he claimed he and his girlfriend , who can not be named for legal reasons , abandoned the infant as the couple believed they could get into trouble after choosing to have a home birth			1
the 27 - year - old , who worked on his parents ' rural @entity36 farm before coming to @entity38 in 2008 , admitted child cruelty after leaving the infant in the bag on a cool night last may			1
@entity41 , prosecuting , said the couple had left the little girl - who also can not be named for legal reasons - in a bag on the doorstep of the home of father @entity48			2
mr @entity41 told the court : ' on may 3 last year , at about a quarter to eight at night , he [ @entity50 ] left his home to visit a friend in hospital at the nearby @entity54			2
' he noted it was a chilly evening			0
' he left at 7.45pm and returned at about 9pm and saw , at the top of the steps leading up to his front door , a black sports holdall zipped - up almost completely			0
' from inside the bag , father @entity48 heard the sound of a baby crying softly			2
' he opened it , looked inside and saw a small infant			0
he took the bag inside and the police were called			0
' inside the bag they found , next to the baby , a baby 's bottle , two clean nappies , a dummy , a scarf , a towel , a silver chain and a note in @entity36			1
' the note began ' @entity79 ' and asked the priest for a ' huge favour ' , requesting he first take the fortnight - old baby to hospital for a check - up before seeing to it that the little girl was brought up by a @entity36 family			1
the note added : ' i need to act like this because i am unable to provide dignified conditions for her			2
' i am enclosing a neck chain with this letter and ask you to get the future parents to pass it onto her			2
' it has been blessed by the @entity23			1
' father @entity48 left his home to visit a friend in hospital at the nearby @entity54 ( pictured )			2
when he returned he discovered the baby paramedics took the girl to hospital and she was examined and found to be fine			1
a police appeal for information saw the mother 's family in @entity36 contact authorities to say they suspected she may be involved after they recognised the holdall the infant was found in			2
on may 9 last year police visited the three - bedroom cottage the couple lived in , rent - free , at the dairy farm where @entity0 worked as a £ 22,000 pounds - a - year farmhand in @entity121			1
both were arrested and the little girl 's mother began crying and asked after the welfare of her daughter , said mr @entity41			0
the court heard that the pair - who met on the internet in june 2011 before the woman joined @entity131 in the @entity38 the following month - had £ 6,000 pounds in bank savings as well as wads of cash in sterling , @entity132 and @entity133 dollars			1
@entity0 told police at interview his partner had given birth at home on april 19 and the pair had later read on the internet that such practice was illegal in the @entity38			1
fearing their daughter may be taken away from them , they decided to abandon her instead			0
the father , along with the girl 's mother , placed the child into a black holdall bag along with a silver chain blessed by the @entity23 and a note and left her on a doorstep about a week before they finally left the girl , the couple had made an abortive attempt to carry out their plan , deciding against going through with it at the last minute as there were several drunks in the area			1
describing the events of may 3 , mr @entity41 said : ' they drove to @entity6 in mr @entity0 's car with their daughter in the bag on the back seat			1
' after they arrived @entity0 walked up to the house and , seeing the lights on and cars parked outside , believed the priest would be at home			1
at 8.24pm , mr @entity41 said , the baby 's mother walked alone to the door with the bag and put her daughter down before ringing the buzzer and then returning to the car			2
the couple then drove away and it was around 30 minutes before the little girl was found			2
@entity189 , defending , said the ' unusual ' case was a result of the two parents being ' unable to cope ' in a strange environment far away from home			0
the little girl had been very well cared for and was wrapped up warm on the night she was found , he said			0
' no harm was caused to the child as a result of the very short exposure			0
' this is a very different case to other cases of abandonment or cruelty , ' added mr @entity189			0
@entity0 , who trained in animal husbandry in @entity36 before studying at the @entity204 in @entity38 , was a hardworking individual who wanted to support his family and was now allowed to have supervised contact with his daughter			1
mr @entity189 said : ' he has , through his guilty plea , shown remorse for what he did that fateful evening			0
' @entity0 currently earns £ 400 pounds a month and lives in a caravan with other agricultural labourers in @entity214 , the court heard			1
wearing a grey suit over a blue shirt and grey tie , he sat alongside a female @entity36 interpreter in the dock			0
the defendant had admitted a single count of child cruelty at an earlier hearing			0
sentencing him to a 16 - week jail term , suspended for a year , judge @entity224 described the case as ' unusual and difficult ' but said @entity0 's actions represented an ' enormous and unwarranted risk			1
' the little girl was ' utterly defenceless , ' said the judge , who added : ' this was attempted permanent abandonment			0
' the motivations for the abandonment were ' obscure , ' he said			0
' in short , this was clearly abandonment that had been planned and reflected on , however immaturely			0
' a formal not guilty verdict was recorded against the child 's teenage mother at an earlier hearing when prosecutors offered no evidence against her on the same count			0
the blonde , wearing a black dress , was in court to support her partner and clasped his hand as he walked free from the dock .			0
