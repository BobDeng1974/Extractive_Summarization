by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:22 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:41 est , 27 december 2013 a seven - year - old boy who suffered a severe allergic reaction to his medication has developed a rare condition which caused his skin to shed			1
@entity8 was diagnosed with epilepsy and given medication to help manage his condition			1
but 12 days after taking the tablets , the youngster started to complain of a headache and cold and developed a rash			1
@entity8 , 11 , was diagnosed with epilepsy and given medication to help manage his condition			1
but he has since suffered a severe allergic reaction to it - and the allergy has caused his skin to shed then his entire body burst into blisters before his hair and finger and toenails fell out - leaving him looking he had been burnt alive			1
the bizarre condition is known as @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , which causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake 's			1
the severe reaction caused @entity8 to lose 100 per cent of his skin and is causing damage to his internal organs			1
the youngster has been on life - support machines and sedated for three weeks to allow his body to recover			1
but his distraught parents @entity38 , 45 and @entity39 , 43 , have been warned by doctors that his chance of survival is just 65 per cent			0
mrs @entity43 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , has lobbied the drugs company to include a warning on medication			2
she said : ' it is the most horrific thing for a parent to have to see their child suffer in the way @entity8 has			1
the severe reaction caused @entity8 to lose 100 per cent of his skin and is causing damage to his internal organs			1
he has also lost his hair and nails and is ' in agony ' , says his mother ' it has been the worst thing i could ever describe , devastating			1
he is in agony - and usually he is such a happy little boy			2
' he loves playing on his @entity64 and riding his bike and his scooter			0
now he ca n’t even open his eyes			0
' everybody who meets him falls in love with him			0
i know i ’m biased because i ’m his mum , but @entity8 is the sort of little boy that , when you meet him , you do n’t forget him			1
' on friday we thought we had lost him when his temperature plummeted and he was diagnosed with hypothermia but the doctors have been able to warm him up			1
after friday i think he can fight anything			0
' each day it is something else , we do n’t know what is going to happen , one hour to the next			0
' the condition is affecting all his major organs			2
one day he could be fine and then it will affect something else			0
the doctors will treat that , and then it will affect something else			0
' she added : ' we need to raise awareness about the side effects of this drug and make sure it has a warning on the label			0
in @entity100 the drug carries a warning so it should do here , too			0
@entity8 's mother @entity38 said : ' it is the most horrific thing for a parent to have to see their child suffer in the way @entity8 has			2
you feel so helpless ' ' i want to educate as many people as i can about @entity27			2
this can happen with any medication , not just what @entity8 was taking			1
' you need to read the leaflet and make sure your child is not sensitive to anything			0
i would n’t want anybody else to go through what we have been through			0
i just need my little boy back			0
' @entity8 was diagnosed with epilepsy last month and prescribed drug carbamazepine			1
mrs @entity43 said the side effects listed on the packaging only said ' can cause a rash '			2
he fell ill at school on december 3 and developed a rash on his chest two days later			1
doctors first diagnosed him with a virus and then measles before a dermatologist identified the rare condition			1
he has gradually became covered in blisters the size of golf balls before the whole top layer of his skin shed			2
since then he has been wrapped in bandages head to toe to protect his delicate skin and given strong painkillers and sedated to help dull the agonising pain			1
the family has received support from celebrities including tv presenter @entity147 and singer @entity148 @entity8 has the most severe form of @entity27 and the swelling has affected his internal organs , so he is on a ventilator to help him breathe			1
he also has a related condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis			1
@entity27 affects just three in one million people and is usually triggered by an adverse reaction to medication			1
the mortality rate is around 15 per cent			0
victims develop terrible scarring all over their bodies and well as severe conjunctivitis which can lead to blindness and mouth infections which can stop them eating			0
