@entity18 , 17 , has turned the mundane into the insane by taking his ironing board to the most extraordinary of locations a pressing need for adventure : the 17 - year - old was inspired to perform his bizarre stunts after he was given a calender called ' extreme ironing ' creasing up : the daredevil says his pictures have made his friends laugh and he has enjoyed ironing - so long as he does n't have to do it in his home the teenager travels around his hometown of @entity32 , @entity33 in search of the weirdest places to ' iron '			1
