by @entity1 reporter three years ago @entity2 was given just 48 hours to live after a four - year battle with anorexia left her weighing a mere 4½ stone			1
her shocking decline was fuelled by an obsession with photo - graphs of super-slim celebrities in glossy magazines			1

miss @entity2 ’s descent into anorexia began when , at 13 , she started to idolise celebrities and obsess over their figures			1
she stuck magazine cuttings inside her school locker and compiled motivational scrapbooks which she would pore over to prevent herself from eating when she felt hungry			1
desperate to achieve a ‘ celebrity figure ’ , she would survive on half an apple every two days , and once went without food or water for ten days			2
@entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ‘ although airbrushed images did n’t actually cause my eating disorder , once i was unwell i would obsess over them			1
' it was n’t until later that i realised what an effect these images can have and how they affected the things i did or how i felt			2
‘ although these glossy magazines are n’t actually aimed at under 16s , they still read them			1
if an image has been airbrushed it should say so and which parts of the body have been altered			2
‘ people should be comfortable with who they are and not be ashamed to go out in public no matter how they look			2
’ obsession : @entity20 started to idolise slim stars when she was younger , including @entity73 , left , and @entity74 , right , and began to starve herself in order the get the ' celebrity figure ' aged 13 in january 2005 , @entity47 was a healthy size 10 - 12 , weighing eight stone , but she made a @entity80 ’s resolution to lose weight			1

the death of her grandmother aggravated the illness			2
she switched to a vegetarian diet and secretly did 1,000 sit - ups every morning and evening			1
she started making herself sick after eating and disguised her shrinking frame with baggy clothes			1
the first of eight hospital admissions over the course of her illness happened in march 2007 when she collapsed at home			0
speaking of her state of mind at the time , she said : ‘ i was cutting out pictures of models and celebrities and filling scrapbooks with them			1
my obsession at the time was @entity73			0

campaign : @entity2 and mother @entity117 have started a campaign to get airbrushing banned or at least captioned in magazine images ‘ i had them pinned up everywhere			2
i even took it in the hospital with me and stuck it in the wardrobe			0

i do n’t know how my body got through it			0
