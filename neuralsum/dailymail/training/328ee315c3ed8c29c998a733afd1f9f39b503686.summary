' ' i spent 20 years wrongfully in prison for something i did n't do , and i 've been fighting all these years to prove that , ' @entity10 said to @entity50 9			1
' the law , the facts , the evidence and the witnesses , as they exist at the present time , as well as the passing of 20 years creates a set of circumstances where the @entity1 does not believe that it can meet its burden of proof at a jury trial of ' beyond a reasonable doubt , ' a motion made by @entity19 district attorney @entity52 said			1
what happened next was a surprise to @entity10 and her team of lawyers			2

' hugs at last : @entity10 was convicted of the 1994 murder of her 15 - week - old son			1
his throat had been slashed and @entity10 , then 17 , was sent to prison for first - degree murder freedom ! new dna evidence , which the @entity19 district attorney 's office says was n't available 20 years ago , helped overturn @entity10 's conviction early in 2014 ' i could do nothing but cry , ' she said			1

@entity10 was just 17 years old at the time			2
her other child , a two - year - old girl , was taken into protective custody when she was arrested			0
her lawyers believe that blood at the scene that was first thought to be hers was the evidence that saw her heading to jail			0
prosecutors claimed that samples of blood at the crime scene did not belong to the baby			0
however , subsequent dna testing proved that the initial findings were incorrect			0
her lawyer , @entity52 , felt that such errors may well have affected the verdict against her			0
@entity10 's attorneys filed a motion prior to her release to have the dna evidence tested against @entity117 , a key witness in the original case who committed suicide before the trial @entity117 lived in the same apartment complex and was reportedly the last person to see @entity10 's baby alive			1
botched investigation : blood from the crime scene that was originally used to convict @entity10 did not belong to her @entity10 was just 17 at the time of the baby 's killing			2
she also have to give up her two - year - old daughter police have a 1994 taped confession of @entity10 saying she leaned over her baby with a knife and accidentally killed him , but her lawyer said the confession was forced			1
it 's claimed the baby was killed by 14 - year - old @entity117 who lived in the neighborhood and committed suicide after @entity10 's preliminary trial			1
it was @entity117 who called 911 from a pay phone in the neighborhood the night the baby died and told operators he was reporting a domestic situation			0
@entity117 also later testified that he could n't sleep and was walking around outside the apartment complex in the middle of the night when he heard @entity10 and the baby 's father arguing			2
he claimed that through the apartment windows , he saw @entity10 carry the baby from one room to another , and the next time she appeared , she had blood on her arms and the baby was in the floor in blood			2
@entity52 said he is a ' minister of justice , ' and he felt he could n't go forward in prosecuting @entity10 further because ' @entity163 has a way of taking away evidence , ' the witnesses are 20 years older , and the @entity166 is n't that exact in this case			1
' if you ca n't go forward in the case , you 've got ta do the next right thing and move to dismiss , ' @entity52 said			0
the case was dismissed with prejudice , which prevents it from being refiled in the future			0
@entity10 can , however , file a claim against the government for the handling of the case , although the compensation in @entity1 would be capped at $ 175,000			0
@entity10 is now spending her first weekend in 20 years with her family			1
