the @entity0 are on course to more than double their vote share in @entity2 at the next general election , potentially stripping 31 seats from the @entity5			1
the swing could see @entity5 reduced to just 10 mps in their traditional heartland of @entity2 , and could put @entity9 out of @entity11 's reach			1
buoyed by the recent independence campaign , @entity13 's party are predicted to take 43 per cent of the vote next may , compared with just 20 per cent in 2010			1
meanwhile support for @entity5 would be decimated , falling from 42 per cent at the last @entity18 election to just 26 per cent			0
@entity13 could see the @entity0 double its vote share at the next general election , returning 45 mps to @entity18 , and almost wiping @entity5 off the political map such a dramatic shift in @entity2 's political landscape would be a bitter blow to new @entity5 leader @entity26 , who has vowed to retain every on of @entity5 's seats , and an embarrassment to beleaguered @entity11			1
the new poll , conducted by @entity30 for the @entity31 , could prove disastrous for mr @entity11 's hopes of becoming prime minister , even if @entity34 succeeds in splitting the @entity36 vote in the rest of the country			1
most alarmingly for @entity5 , further analysis of the poll by professor @entity41 , of the @entity42 , suggests it could lose some fortress seats that it has held since the 1920s			2
when the seats are broken down into categories and analysed individually , rather than as an overall trend , virtually every @entity5 seat in @entity2 is at risk , he added			1
@entity51 's party are set to drop from 16 per cent to 13 per cent voter share in @entity2 , though they will still retain the single seat they hold north of the border , according to @entity30			1
the @entity56 are looking at another collapse in voter confidence in 2015 , falling from 19 per cent at the last general election to 6 per cent			0
mirroring the political change taking place throughout the @entity63 , both @entity34 and the @entity60 are on course for gains , with @entity67 's party picking up seven per cent of the votes , and the @entity60 finishing on four per cent			2
@entity5 could be reduced from 41 mps to just ten while the @entity0 would gain a crushing majority according to a new poll released today the @entity0 , then lead by @entity72 , returned just six mps at the last general election but could take 45 of @entity2 's 59 constituencies if current trends continue			1
the findings echo those of recent research by @entity80 for the @entity81 , which found that 48 per cent of voters would back the @entity0 with @entity5 trailing on 24 per cent			2
issues on which the @entity0 were strong was the right for @entity2 to set its own corporation tax , which is currently set in @entity86 , where 53 per cent felt the power should be devolved			2
the poll also showed that 43 per cent thought the @entity90 nuclear deterrent should be scrapped , another issue on which the @entity0 campaigns			0
on the issue of the @entity95 , which was set up after the independence vote to recommend powers to hand over to @entity98 , 30 per cent of @entity2 thought its proposals did not go far enough , while 26 per cent though it got the balance right			0
@entity102 , @entity5 's @entity103 , said the recent election of new leader @entity26 heralded a ' fresh start ' for the party			0
she said : ' we will come back in the @entity109 with passion and energy , setting out our vision for making @entity2 the fairest nation on earth			0
' we want the wealthiest @entity2 to pay a little bit more in tax so we can improve our @entity117 and give the poorest kids being let down by the @entity0 government in @entity120 a better start in life			0
the disastrous prediction would be a bitter blow to @entity26 ( left ) , the new @entity5 leader who has publicly vowed to hold every 2010 seat , and may put @entity126 beyond the reach of @entity11 ' the choice facing @entity2 next may is clear - we can send @entity0 @entity73 to the @entity129 to protest against the @entity36 , or we can send @entity130 to replace the @entity36			1
' the only way to remove @entity51 from @entity9 and return a @entity63 @entity5 government is to vote @entity5			0
' @entity133 mp , @entity0 general election campaign director , said : ' this is another very encouraging poll for the @entity0 , on top of the @entity80 poll showing the party on a record high			0
' while these polls are extremely welcome , we take absolutely nothing for granted - and the hard work begins in the @entity109 to ensure that @entity2 's voice is heard at @entity18			2
' this is the second poll in a week showing that @entity26 has experienced a ' reverse honeymoon ' as @entity5 , with @entity5 trailing far behind the @entity0			0
' it will take more than a change of leader to turn around the fortunes of a party paying the price for a toxic alliance with the @entity36			0
' more and more people are putting their trust in the @entity0 to stand up for @entity2 's interests , and ensure that @entity18 delivers the powers needed to strengthen and grow the @entity2 economy and create a fairer society			1

@entity5 could lose 31 @entity2 seats next year as @entity0 doubles vote share
@entity13 's party could take 45 out of @entity2 's 59 constituencies
disastrous result could put @entity126 beyond the reach of @entity11
