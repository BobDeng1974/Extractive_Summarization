@entity2 will not win the next election if he continues to lurch to the left , @entity1 former spin doctor @entity0 has warned			1
in a challenge to the @entity1 leader , the former business secretary , who was one of the founders of @entity1 , said that those who believe the country has moved to the left following the financial crisis are wrong			0
‘ those who do n't give their political loyalty automatically to left or right – whose votes , therefore , are up for grabs – are a greater segment of the electorate now than they were when @entity1 was being created in the 1990s , ’ he said			0
lord @entity0 : the former trade and industry secretary believes that @entity1 must retreat to the centre ground ‘ therefore , it is even more important now to win the centre ground to win electoral victory			1
’ @entity0 made the comments in an interview with @entity26 to celebrate 20 years since @entity27 became leader , but it is clear he wants mr @entity2 to learn lessons from his electoral success			1
he said : ‘ it is essential still to win on leadership and the economy , and to demonstrate that we are a party of conscience and reform that will talk to people 's values and concerns , not simply keep driving an agenda of our own regardless of the electorate 's views			0
‘ that is why i get frustrated sometimes when people argue now that the country has moved to the left , therefore if we are more unambiguously left - wing and raise our ideological vigour , we are more likely to win the next election			0
’ the @entity1 peer argued the party needs to heed the lesson of defeat in 1992 under @entity55			1
he said : ‘ the truth was , however fed up people were with the @entity59 , they were not going to switch to @entity1 in sufficient numbers unless they were absolutely sure of what we were going to do in government			0
' all right ! ' @entity55 at the start of the ill - fated 1992 general election campaign when people did not trust @entity1 despite being fed up with the @entity59 after 13 years in power ; present @entity1 leader @entity2 who @entity0 thinks is taking the party far too far to the left to win the next general election ‘ we had to demonstrate that we really could manage people 's money and steer an economic course that would deliver sustainable economic growth and jobs			1
’ @entity0 said that mr @entity27 ’s opponents in the party had to wait for the @entity77 invasion before they could remove him			2
‘ it gave them a stick to beat @entity27 with , knowing they were going to get media support , the right - wing media because he was @entity1 , and the left - wing media because he was @entity1			2
they hated his electoral success and @entity77 was the opportunity to dislodge him , ’ he said			0
@entity27 is due to give a speech on 21 july to mark 20 years since he became @entity1 leader .			2

' the party needs to heed the lesson of defeat in 1992 under @entity55 '
