by @entity0 last updated at 10:27 pm on 15th october 2011 a @entity2 woman whose immigrant husband abandoned her weeks after getting into the @entity2 via an arranged marriage revealed yesterday how the authorities spent ten years ignoring her pleas to deport him for flouting the law			1
the 32 - year - old , who has asked to remain anonymous after threats from her husband ’s family , spoke out after learning to her horror that he has been told by the @entity15 that he can stay in the @entity2			1
she has spent a decade enduring his taunts about how he has taken the immigration system for a ride			1
ignored : the woman whose immigrant husband abandoned her weeks after getting into the @entity2 following an arranged marriage			1
she has asked to remain anonymous she even took police to the house where the man was hiding – only for him to escape via the back door when bungling officers left it uncovered			1
worse , she says her life is ‘ ruined ’ because she can never recover from the shame of sharia law divorce – even though they are still married under @entity2 law			1
her protest has been taken up by deputy commons speaker @entity35 , who is collecting a dossier of similar cases for home secretary @entity38			2
he said : ‘ it is scandalous that this lady spent ten years telling the police and the @entity15 of her husband ’s illegal behaviour – yet they did nothing			1
‘ it makes our immigration system look like a joke			1
’ supportive : deputy commons speaker @entity35 said the case makes the immigration system look ' like a joke ' the incident came to light after ministers said two thirds of people who come to the @entity2 on marriage visas have never set foot in the country before			1
the government is proposing several new curbs , including encouraging people to report suspected illegal immigrants , outlawing forced marriages and making families of would - be immigrants pay a cash bond			1
the woman , who contacted @entity70 , is a respected member of her community in @entity73 , @entity74			2
the daughter of @entity77 immigrants , she was born in the @entity2 , is ‘ proud to consider myself @entity79 ’ and has a full - time professional career			1
she said she had been happy to enter an arranged marriage because she considered it ‘ part of her culture ’			2
aged 21 , she went to @entity77 to meet her husband , who was her cousin , and they got married			2
she returned to @entity2 , where she bought and renovated a house while she waited for her husband to join her			1
she said : ‘ it was n’t a love marriage , though i believed love would come after we married			2
‘ but eight weeks after he arrived , he moved out and moved in with an uncle who lived round the corner			2
' i was very shocked			2
we phoned his mother back in @entity77 and she said “ just give him a visa and throw him out ”			2
we could n’t believe it			0
they had been planning it all along			0
i had kept his passport , and he sent people round to get it			0
i knew he would destroy it to remove any evidence of when he had entered the country			0
getting tough : immigration minister @entity113 says the government is toughening the system to prevent abuse ‘ then he started harassing me			1
he even sent his grandmother to berate me			0
he pushed his way into my mum and dad ’s house and abused them			0
i had to call the police to stop him			0
the @entity15 and the @entity2 @entity124 said they could n’t do anything until his one - year marriage visa expired			1
‘ all the time he taunted me over the way he had got into the country			0
on one occasion i tracked him down myself			0
i called the police and they knocked on the front door of the house where he was staying			0
he got out via the back and has never been seen again			0
‘ recently i was informed he has been given leave to remain here for three years			0
he qualifies for benefits even though he has never paid a penny in tax because he works for cash illegally			0
incredibly , he is now using legal aid to divorce me			0
he wants to marry someone else to increase his chances of staying here for good			0
‘ i have been humiliated			0
i obtained a @entity150 divorce on the grounds of desertion , but we are still man and wife under @entity79 law			1
as a @entity158 once you are divorced , no one will marry you			0
‘ i have been telling the authorities for years that he should be sent back , but they have done nothing			0
the people who suffer most are genuine immigrants who come here legally because it makes people hostile to them			2
’ a spokesman for immigration minister @entity113 said : ‘ for too long the immigration system was allowed to get out of control , decisions were not taken quickly enough and that meant those who should not have been allowed to stay were able to do so			1
‘ the government is toughening the system to prevent abuse			1
