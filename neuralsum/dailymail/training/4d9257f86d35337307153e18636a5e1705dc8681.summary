it has been described as ' the poster child ' for shoddy @entity3 manufacturing and ridiculed for its ' dreadful ' handling - but the @entity5 has somehow escaped the label of ' worst car ever '			1
the vehicle came in at number ten on a list voted for by readers of motor magazine @entity13 - with the @entity15 - made @entity14 taking the undesirable top spot			1
one critic likened its appearance to a ' melted hearse ' and said : ' if it were human , not even its mother could love it			1
' the only thing worse than looking at the @entity14 is driving it			2
' second on the list of embarrassing motors was the @entity49 electric car which was described as ' ugly as sin '			2
cheap foreign imports have also earned strong places in the list of shambolic vehicles			2
bronze medal went to ' ugly duckling ' the @entity57 while fourth on the list was the @entity60 - made @entity59			1
number three : the @entity57 was slammed by one reader as ' a novelty car that was no fun at all ' number four : the @entity60 - made @entity59 came in at fourth on the list with reader saying it ' lacked any desirability at all ' number five : @entity69 's @entity68 was ' poorly received from the off , with its build quality coming in for particular criticism ' coming in at five on the shameful list was the @entity69 which was heavily criticised after being released in 2003			1
@entity75 , known for its manufacturing prowess , will no doubt want to forget number six and seven on the list - the @entity80 and @entity81 x- 90 - which one reader said had ' zero off - road ability '			1

and last but not least was the @entity5 , manufactured by @entity97 from 1973 until 1982			2
@entity98 once candidly said : ' deciding which one is worse ( the @entity5 or @entity87 ) , is like deciding which leg you 'd rather have amputated			1
' the @entity5 was named ' the worst @entity3 car ever made ' in a 2008 poll by @entity105 but @entity13 readers have been kinder to the 1970s model , putting it last in their list			1
number six : the @entity80 , another @entity75 flop , was said to be overpriced with poor handling number seven : the @entity112 is not a car @entity75 will be proud of , with readers saying it had ' awful handling ' number eight : the @entity87 was condemned by @entity13 readers as ' an utterly awful car ' number nine : the @entity92 , produced in the @entity119 , was said to be ' uncomfortable and basic in the extreme ' number 10 : the @entity5 was described as ' everything bad about @entity3 car manufacturing in the seventies ' below are the top ten worst cars as voted for by @entity13 readers with their comments : 1 ) @entity14 : ' it 's time these were taken away and destroyed			1
