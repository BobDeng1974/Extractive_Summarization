two employees at a @entity2 barbecue restaurant have been fired after a @entity4 post suggesting @entity5 are bad tippers went viral			1
the post included a photograph of @entity9 , a worker at @entity10 's in @entity11 , holding a cardboard sign that says : ' spare change ? help , i 'm a server at @entity10 's on @entity17 weekend			1
anything helps ! 5c , 25c ! it 's more than my tips			1

she and the employee who took the photo were both fired			1
the other employee has n't been named			0
' like many employers , we employ many people			0
social media allows an outlet for these opinions , ' owner @entity40 said in a statement on @entity4			0
' sadly , for reasons unknown to me , often times bitter employees also try to embarrass the employers and taint the businesses where they work			0
clearly a recent post by a now former employee fits this description			1
' he added that the post was ' obviously offensive and ridiculous			2
' festival : the picture , taken at the @entity11 restaurant , pictured , was posted before the annual @entity17 festival , which brings hundreds of @entity5 to the area viral : the racially charged post went viral and made its way to the restaurant 's @entity4 page @entity40 told the @entity64 that @entity28 had privately apologized to him for her ' mistake			1

some people even cancelled catering orders			0
@entity28 denied creating the cardboard sign she holds in the picture , but she does n't deny posing for the picture			2
' one of my friends that worked there as well came to visit , and she asked me to hold this poster up , so she could send a @entity86 , ' @entity28 told @entity87 10			0
mistake : @entity28 , pictured , apologized for her poor judgement on local tv but it was posted on @entity4 as well as @entity86 - a photo sharing app where pictures are meant to disappear after they 've been received			2
she added to @entity87 : ' people are just assuming it was me who made the sign			2
not that it really matters because , i mean , she asked me to hold it up and i did			0
i could have said no. but i take full responsibility			0
it was something i chose to do			0
' since the picture was posted , @entity28 has received several threats , according to the tv station , and the @entity108 has even called to do a welfare check .			2
