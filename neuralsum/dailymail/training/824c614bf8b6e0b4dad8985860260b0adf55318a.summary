@entity0 turned an @entity2 segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of @entity5 into a soapbox for his thoughts on black - on - black crime			1
the former mayor appeared on @entity10 on sunday to address a debate about disproportionately white police forces in predominately black cities like @entity5			1
@entity0 must believe there is value in making police forces representative of the population , stating it was a goal not only of his administration but of all @entity20 mayors since @entity21			2
sound off : @entity0 appeared on @entity10 and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of @entity5 to say white cops would n't be needed ' if you were n't killing each other ' ' we 've tried to make the police force of @entity20 as proportionate as we possibly can			1
we go out of our way to do that			0
i think we do a pretty good job , not a perfect job			0
' he quickly diverted from that subject , arguing with @entity2 contributor and @entity37 professor @entity36 about black crime			0
' i find it very disappointing that you 're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in @entity43 are killed by other blacks , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 did not mention the source used , though a study from the @entity48 found in reported crimes from 2005 , 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black			1
the study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person			1
@entity36 pushed back against @entity0 , calling the link made by the mayor a ' false equivalency			0
' ' first of all , most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail , ' @entity36 said			0
back and forth : on a segment about racially proportionate police , @entity0 first stated he worked to keep a balanced force , then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods ' number two , they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law , ' he added			1
@entity0 took off his glasses and cut in to argue for more police in black neighborhoods as @entity36 questioned officers ' ability to effectively police those communities			0
' the police presence can not make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals , ' he stated			0
the segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while @entity89 , attorney for @entity91 's family , sat silent , before @entity0 capped his rant			0
' why do n’t you cut it down so so many white police officers do n’t have to be in black areas ? ' @entity0 shouted			2
' the white police officers would n’t be there if you were n’t killing each other			2

the former @entity20 mayor was on @entity10 to talk about racially proportionate police forces
he *proclaimed* it was ' very disappointing ' the *conversation* was n't about blacks killing blacks
a study from the @entity48 found in 2005 , 93 percent of black *homicide* victims were killed by another black person
the same study found 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person
