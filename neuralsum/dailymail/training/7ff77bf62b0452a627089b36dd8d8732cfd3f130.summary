the company who provides and maintains the faulty scaffolding that left two men dangling 69 stories in the air at the @entity6 on wednesday afternoon has had two other major incident in just the past six years			1
the @entity8 , the @entity9 based company that is responsible for the equipment at the $ 3.9 billion skyscraper , even had one worker fall to their death using their equipment			2
this in addition to an incident just last year that is remarkably similar to what happened on wednesday			0
@entity31 died immediately , while @entity36 somehow managed to hold on , this despite bleeding in his brain , a collapsed lung and broken bones throughout his body			2
death scene : the @entity43 ( above ) , where one worker died and another was critically injured he could not speak for weeks , and initially even the slightest movement could have been deadly			0
he miraculously managed to recover , and never again washed windows			0
on june 12 , 2013 , an incident unfolded at @entity49 's @entity27 that was almost exactly like what happened at @entity24 on wednesday			1
two scaffold - maintenance workers got caught between the forty - fourth and forty - fifth floors of the building			2
these two men , @entity55 and @entity56 , had their scaffolding buckle on them , and were waiting 90 minutes for firefighters to cut through the glass in the building and pull them in			1
and , as @entity63 points out , both of these incidents occurred with equipment from @entity65			0
there is no word yet if the @entity68 and @entity69 will attempt to get out of their contract with @entity8 following this latest incident			2
the two men trapped outside and almost 1,000 feet high for 90 minutes yesterday , @entity72 and @entity73 , suffered no injuries , but were immediately rushed to @entity28 's @entity76 where they were treated for minor hypothermia			1
@entity73 revealed in an interview that he was so certain that the rig was not going to hold up that he even called his wife to say goodbye for the final time , expressing how much he loved her and asking that she look after their children			0
they were saved when firefighters cut through the building 's glass and pulled the men in to safety			1
getting them safe : at the @entity27 ( above ) , firefighters cut through the glass to get the workers in and safe weighing options : firefighters considered numerous options at @entity24 ( above ) , but eventually decided to cut through the glass @entity24 , at 1,776 feet and 104 stories , is the tallest building in the @entity100			1
it stands on the same spot the @entity6 stood , and tenants just began moving in earlier this week			0
when reached for comment , a woman who would not give her name said , ' we have no comment at this time , ' before abruptly hanging up the phone .			0

the @entity8 , the company responsible for the scaffolding at @entity24 , has had three life - threatening incidents in seven years
in june 2013 , two workers had their scaffold buckle at the @entity27 in @entity28 , and were stuck for 90 minutes before being saved by firefighters
just like wednesday 's @entity118 , at @entity119 the firefighters cut through the glass to bring the men ti safety
in december 2007 , a *malfunction* caused two workers to plummet 500 feet to the ground at the @entity32 in @entity28
one of the men , @entity129 , died on the scene , while his brother @entity36 somehow managed to survive
the @entity8 still has ' no comment ' about wednesday 's incident
