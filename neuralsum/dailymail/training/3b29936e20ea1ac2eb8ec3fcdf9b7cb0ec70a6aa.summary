’ mr @entity41 said the total impact on the economy and on individuals was ‘ extremely difficult to work out , because the libor rate was manipulated up as well as down ’			1
‘ sometimes the rate was too low for the true market price , and sometimes it was too high , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity87 has made it clear , however , that that contributed to a risk to the country ’s financial stability , and the cost of that is enormous			2
’ @entity94 , director of enforcement at the @entity87 , said : ‘ the initial indications are that @entity4 was not the only firm that was involved in this			2

giant @entity183 bank @entity74 said it had approached regulators with information over abuses of the rate - setting system			0
the libor rate is crucial , since it is a key benchmark for trillions of pounds ’ worth of financial products			0
the £ 290million fine on @entity4 from the @entity9 and @entity176 authorities , issued on wednesday , is likely to be only the beginning of a wave of punishments and civil suits for damages against other banks caught up in the global web of deceit			1
@entity69 and @entity100 are two other @entity9 - based banks under scrutiny as part of the probe experts said banks might have to set aside billions of pounds in damages to cover their liabilities resulting from the conspiracy			1
former @entity209 spokesman @entity208 said that once any criminal probe was underway , a public inquiry – like the one being conducted by @entity211 into media ethics – would have to be held			1

speech : @entity3 alongside @entity41 at the @entity219 on 3 november 2011 , @entity3 , chief executive of @entity4 , delivered the @entity223 programme ’s inaugural business lecture			1
today , his words have come back to haunt him			0
‘ rebuilding trust requires banks to be better citizens			0
i believe in this passionately			0

‘ i know how angry customers are about issues such as payment protection insurance			0
that ’s why we are working hard to clear claims as quickly as possible			0
we want to put things right			0
’ when a person takes out a credit card or personal loan , they buy the insurance to pay out if they lose their job , or have to stop working due to poor health			0
but banks , including @entity4 , were selling the policies to people who did not need them			1
@entity4 said the @entity258 scandal would cost them £ 1billion			2
four months after making this speech , he admitted the bill had increased to £ 1.3billion			0
‘ but for me the evidence of culture is how people behave when no one is watching them			0
our culture must be one where the interests of customers and clients are at the very heart of every decision we make , where we all act with trust and integrity			0
’ the @entity87 this week found @entity4 guilty of misconduct ‘ extended over number of years ’			2
the @entity176 @entity278 said simply that the bank was guilty of ‘ illegal conduct ’ on its attempts to manipulate the @entity36 rate			0
