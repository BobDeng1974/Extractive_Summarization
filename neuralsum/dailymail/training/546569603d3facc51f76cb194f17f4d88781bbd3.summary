@entity0 were held to a 1 - 1 draw in @entity2 as their @entity4 campaign got off to a disappointing start			1
@entity6 gave the @entity7 a first - half lead but @entity2 hit back through @entity9 to earn the visitors a point			1
@entity12 looks on during the first half of @entity0 's @entity4 clash with @entity2 @entity6 had an up and down evening @entity6 showed the best and worst of his game on tuesday night			1
there was aggression to win the ball , that ability to set the tempo with his passing and his goal			0
but he also faded in influence , missed a fine chance to make it 2 - 0			1
@entity6 fires @entity0 ahead with a clinical finish during the first half against @entity2 @entity29 's game has n't changed @entity29 has lost none of the prickly aggression that saw him end @entity34 's @entity33 chances in 2010			1
his crunching tackle in the @entity36 ensured @entity34 's last game for @entity0 would be short lived			0
on tuesday night @entity38 decided to take on the former @entity40 player with a trick or two - only to run head - first into a cynical body check			0
@entity29 put in another typically boisterous performance at @entity44 on tuesday night @entity44 silent long gone are the days when @entity46 clubs provided the atmosphere in @entity48			0
it 's generally down to away fans to create any volume and last night was no different with @entity2 's followers providing a steady stream of chants and songs despite their club 's poor start to the @entity58			0
@entity2 's fans were in good voice throughout the game at @entity44 on tuesday night close shave for @entity63 after @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 were doused by sprinklers last week , @entity63 , an analyst for @entity65 tv , came perilously close to being soaked pitch - side last night , managing to maintain a straight face as he broadcast to the nation as a light drizzle sprayed the back of his @entity77 style sports jacket			0
back on track 0 - that was the number of goals @entity2 had scored against @entity0 in four previous outings			2
but despite being injured - ravaged and out of form in the @entity58 they deserved the @entity9 goal last night @entity9 fires home expertly from just outside the area to give @entity2 a share of the spoils			2
