by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 08:38 est , 14 october 2013 following on from singer @entity3 's damning statement about @entity7 ' @entity6 tongue - wagging antics , oral hygiene experts say it 's evidence that she is stressed			1
the pop legend , 67 , told @entity11 : ' @entity12 , do n't stick out your tongue if it 's coated			1
' now , get the gloss writer @entity15 gets the lowdown on what the tongue can reveal about our overall health ... @entity7 , pictured at the @entity22 release party for her new album @entity24 on tuesday , shows off her tongue some of @entity7 ' recent antics may have left you feeling like an amateur gynecologist – that @entity6 performance , those @entity30 pictures … as it happens such intimate access and some close inspection has given away something about her health , you just have to look two feet higher - at her tongue			1
we were n't the only ones to notice something was a little ' off ' but perhaps @entity3 said it best : ' @entity12 , do n't stick out your tongue if it 's coated			1
' agreeing with @entity3 is @entity43 , co-founder of victoriahealth.com : ' your tongue is a window into what 's happening in your body ; colour , coating and cracks are all indicators of the state of your health			1
' @entity54 has been at it too choosing a protruding tongue and rock sign as her pap - pose of choice			0
they may think their tongue - poking gives nothing away but actually they could n't reveal more			2
at one point @entity7 licks a sledgehammer in the @entity30 inspired video for @entity67 @entity43 reveals : ' a healthy tongue has a thin , white and moist coating and any deviation from this indicates possible problem			1
' @entity73 smile director dr @entity72 agrees : ' a thin coating is normal but a thick white coating could indicate candidiasis or oral thrush , which is a fungus			1
' @entity79 medicine actually uses the tongue as a matter of course to diagnose the state of someone 's health and given that the mouth harbours anywhere between 300 - 400 species of bacteria , it 's vital to have a dental hygiene routine that includes cleaning the tongue			2
maybe @entity7 was n't making out with that sledgehammer in her wrecking ball video , but cleaning her tongue on its rough surface instead ? you may brush your teeth morning , noon and night but according to @entity43 that might not be enough			1
' small protrusions in the tongue can harbour food allowing bacteria and fungi to thrive and this results in a whitish tongue , ' she says			0
essentially clean teeth can be almost immediately ' reinfected ' by a dirty tongue			0
@entity7 was in the midst of her break - up with @entity109 when she took to the stage with @entity111 in august and interestingly the tongue is a sound stress indicator			2
' stress , particularly on - going stress , can cause deeper cracks in the tongue since stress releases inflammatory hormones , ' says @entity43			0
the former child star loves to play up to her bad girl image , especially at her @entity6 appearance @entity72 recommends using a mouthwash twice a day and @entity43 suggests the @entity123 , £ 17.95 , which contains seven herbal extracts that 'll naturally improve any gum and mouth disorders			0
alternatively there are more and more products available to help keep your oral health tip - top , including the dr @entity132 , £ 16 , available at @entity133 that normalizes ph levels in the mouth			0
while a slightly more old - fashioned but no less effective option is the @entity137 , £ 5.10 available from boots that you simply draw from back - to - front along your tongue to scrape off unwanted nasties - for tackling bad breath it 's a winner			0
we may know more about @entity7 than we 'd care to but thanks to her tongue - poking she may have helped us know more about ourselves			2
