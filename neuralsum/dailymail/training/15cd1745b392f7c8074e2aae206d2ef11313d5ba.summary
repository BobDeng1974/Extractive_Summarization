by @entity0 @entity1 : 02:27 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:25 est , 23 december 2013 engineers in @entity4 have invented a robot that can scale walls , inspect aging bridges , and do the crab - walk			1
the multifaceted magnetic bridge bots can scurry faster than you can say their name , @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , at a rapid pace of 7.8 inches per second			1
the robots were developed by engineers at the @entity16 in @entity4 and the team is led by engineering professor @entity18			1
the robots will improve the method of bridge inspection with advanced technology and create less margin for human error			0
this robot uses magnets to grip onto bridges and moves at super fast speed as it inspects bridges for damage @entity30 reports that the robots are operated by remote control			2
they move on four wheels each of which have eight spokes with extremely powerful magnets that can tightly grip surfaces			2
@entity38 reports that the robots have a flexible mid section which allows them to move over uneven structures with ease			2
@entity43 climbing robots are not a new invention , but the previous prototypes used suction cups as oppose to magnets			0
not only do the robots have magnets , they have sensors and cameras that they can use to gather information about their environment			0
@entity30 reports that the robots can locate cracks on bridges and other steel structures			1
@entity18 along with his team will work more on the robot and @entity4 manufacturers will probably manufacture it in three years			1
the trend has already caught on in the @entity60			0
@entity61 reported that @entity62 launched the @entity63 this november and that he donated $ 7 million dollars to @entity61 researchers so that they could create robots to help humans do their jobs better			0
@entity30 reports that a similar robot to @entity12 , named the @entity69 , was created in @entity70 to inspect power lines			2
the @entity69 costs $ 1,000 and is inexpensive compared to older , larger robots and was created via 3d printing			0
as technology advances , helper robots , once seen as a caricature of the future , may become more and more a part of everyday life			0
the robots were invented at @entity16 in @entity4 under the supervision of @entity18			1

@entity12 ( @entity82 ) were invented by @entity18 at @entity16 in @entity4
they can move as fast at 7.8 inches per second and use magnets to grip onto bridges or steel structures
they are not available yet but should be available in @entity4 in three years
