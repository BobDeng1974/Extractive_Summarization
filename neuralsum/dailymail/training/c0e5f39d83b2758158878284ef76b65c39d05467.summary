the world no 1 lasted three games in her doubles match , serving four hopeless double faults in her one service game before defaulting , looking dishevelled and disorientated			1
@entity0 insisted this was due to a ‘ bug ’ , yet according to authoritative sources her pulse , temperature and blood pressure were normal when she received an on - court visit from the doctor			1
‘ she seemed emotional , sad , you know what i mean ? ’ said @entity48			0
@entity0 ’s @entity55 coach , @entity54 , added that he had not seen her for two days before the tie			1
‘ before the match she was fine , ’ he said			0

’ the incident will only heighten speculation about her relationship with @entity54 , with whom she has enjoyed a career surge in her early thirties			0
