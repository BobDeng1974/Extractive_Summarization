by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , the voice of football for a generation of radio listeners , will step down after the @entity8 final , marking the end of an era for @entity12 sport			1
@entity2 has been chief football correspondent for more than 20 years , bringing his unique blend of effortless eloquence and good sense to the @entity12 ’s football coverage			1
in a time when others shout , scream and deliberately provoke in the quest for attention , his delivery has remained steadfastly calm , clear - headed and intelligent , adding to his natural authority and earning him the respect of managers and players			0
stepping down : @entity2 ( right ) , the voice of @entity12 radio commentaries for over 30 years , is set to hang up his microphone after this sunday 's @entity8 final between @entity30 and @entity31 at the @entity32 honour : @entity2 was made an mbe by the @entity35 at @entity36 back in november 2010 his final live game will not be a storybook ending featuring @entity39 in the @entity32 , but @entity31 and @entity30 provide a fitting end with a repeat of the final from his first @entity8 in 1986			1
‘ the world has gone full circle , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i ’ve no idea how many games i ’ve commentated on but over 30 years it ’s probably around 2,000			1

‘ you get in a bubble when you ’re working			0

that ’s when i will realise my life has changed			0
’ it all started on @entity57 , where @entity2 worked for six years from 1973 , often working on the coverage of @entity59 , the team he supported as a boy			1
a famous 3 - 0 win against @entity62 at the @entity63 in the @entity51 is one of his fondest memories of days on the terraces and , years later , he would be light - heartedly unveiled as a @entity68 fan , live on air during a @entity57 game , by co-commentator @entity71			1
early days : @entity2 working for @entity57 interviewing @entity72 and @entity73 commentary duo : 5 live men @entity75 and @entity2 pose for publicity pictures ahead of the 2006 @entity8 in @entity30 @entity2 moved to @entity78 in @entity79 , presenting key programmes such as @entity81 on two and took over from @entity82 as football correspondent in 1991 , with the game on the threshold of a revolution			1
‘ the onset of the @entity90 and the volume of games broadcast live on radio has been the biggest change , ’ said @entity2 , who was in the commentary box when @entity88 scored the first @entity90 goal			1
he maintained his ability to find the crucial elements of any story amid the chaos and crystallise it for the listener , as he did brilliantly on the night @entity39 ’s players threatened to strike over @entity103 ’s ban for a missed drugs test			0
describing the action : @entity107 columnist @entity106 ( centre ) with @entity2 ( right ) and @entity75 ( left ) at a match between @entity110 and @entity111 last season @entity2 has always been a huge music fan , often seen searching for second - hand record shops while on trips abroad			2
and he enjoys fine wine , as @entity117 , his co-commentator on many occasions , can testify			0
retirement will allow him more time to devote to these hobbies and to his family , wife @entity122 and children @entity73 , 13 tomorrow , and @entity124 , 20			0
‘ they have been my rocks , ’ he said			0
