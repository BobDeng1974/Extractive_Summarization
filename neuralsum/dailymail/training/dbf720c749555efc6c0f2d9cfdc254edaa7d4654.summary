by @entity0 last updated at 12:51 am on 31st october 2011 it is a bike whose inventor was once arrested for riding it but later released when police could n't work out what crime he had committed			1
and with a record like that it 's not hard to see why it did n't catch on			2
now though this steam powered motorcycle is set to enter the record books , as the most expensive bike ever to be sold at auction			2
the 117 - year - old ' @entity15 ' was designed by @entity17 and is now expected to reach £ 325,000 when it is sold in @entity18 in january			1
under the hammer : this steam powered motorcycle designed by @entity17 is to be auctioned in the @entity22 and is expected to fetch £ 325,000 enthusiasts from across the globe are expected to bid for the machine which had a top speed of 40mph and consisted of a boiler , steam engine stuck onto a hickory velocipede bicycle frame			1
@entity17 connected the piston rods to cranks on the rear wheel axle and the solid wheels made for a very uncomfortable ride			2
it also appeared that the machine was dangerous - as @entity17 actually died while riding it during 1896			1
the bike worked by using a firebox and boiler suspended on springs from the frame between the wheels			2
a charcoal fire heated the water to generate steam to power the engine			2
the exhaust steam was carried by tubing into a chimney behind the saddle			0
water was supplied from a reservoir that was part of the seat using a feed - water pump operated by the left - cylinder crank			1
the rider could accelerate by turning the grip on the handles that acted as the throttle - in the same way as modern motorbikes			1
rudimentary : the piston rods connected to a crank on the rear wheel axle and the solid wheels made for a very uncomfortable ride following @entity17 's death the bike went through a number of owners who displayed it to the public until it was bought by its current owner in 1996			0
@entity76 , head of @entity77 by @entity79 's @entity78 , said : ' @entity17 built two steam motorcycles and this one dates from 1894			0
' both of them exist and the other , earlier one that was based on a boneshaker cycle , is in the @entity87 museum			0
' at the time the internal combustion engine was in its infancy so no one knew that steam was n't the way forward			0
' when @entity17 invented his machine the word motorcycle had n't even been conceived			1
it is amazing the machine has survived for this long			1
modern way : the rider of the ' @entity15 ' could accelerate by turning the grip on the handles that acted as the throttle - in the same way as today ' not only was it one of the very first motorcycles , but it was involved in the first ever motorcycle accident			1
' @entity17 came off the bike and died and although it was shown he died from a heart attack it is not known whether he had it before or after he came off			0
' the bike is still in working order and although the present owner has n't sued steam , he has put pressure in it and the piston still works			0
' it really was like riding with a locomotive between the legs just hoping it does n't blow up			0
' it is a significant piece of @entity120 and arguably one of the world 's most important motorcycles			0
' the current world record for a motorbike sold at auction is held by a 1915 @entity127			0
