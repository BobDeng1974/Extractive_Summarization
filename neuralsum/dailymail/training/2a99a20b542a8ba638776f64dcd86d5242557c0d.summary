by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 28 february 2013 banned low quality meat stripped from the bones of slaughtered animals is being sold to the @entity6 's sausage makers using a loophole in the law , it emerged today			1
the scraps , known as mechanically separated meat ( @entity12 ) , are given names like ' 3mm mince ' so it can avoid an @entity17 ban and is ending up in @entity6 food , experts say			1
a year ago @entity19 told the government that @entity12 could no longer be categorised as meat in all @entity17 member countries and if used it had to be listed separately on the label			2
but in the latest twist in the food labelling scandal gripping the country it appears the ' leftovers ' are being widely re-branded and then sold to @entity6 producers as meat			1
experts say the ban means that @entity12 was probably replaced with horse meat by producers bent on cutting costs , who then put it in lasagnes and burgers being sold in @entity6 supermarkets			1
today one of the @entity6 's biggest sausage makers admitted they are using ' 3mm mince ' and traders say it is being sold into the @entity6 by @entity57 slaughterhouses under various names			1
it is also known as @entity61 meat , named after a company in @entity63 that produces a meat mincing machine that can strip membrane and sinew from bones , but claims ' it is meat ! '			2
they have sold 5500 of their machines tp food producers in more than 100 countries			0
the system uses a ' squeezing belt that feeds the product to a perforated drum and presses the soft components through the holes of the drum			0
the solid components remain outside the drum , ' their website says			0
emails seen by the @entity85 show that companies across @entity57 are trying to sell this product in @entity6			1
one pork supplier from @entity63 said : ' my information is that you only have to declare @entity12 , and @entity61 no. ' one chicken suppler said : ' @entity12 is derived from chickens with all the meat and skin in its original format and minced via the baader machine , all the bones are separated mechanically			1
this format can be declared as meat in the ingredients			0
' controversial : this version of a ' baader machine ' strips meat from animal and fish bones and produces a fine mince that spills out of the side the ' desinewed ' meat at the centre of the row is made from any flesh left on bones after slaughtering removed by spraying it with low - pressure water			1
it was introduced into the @entity6 in the 1990s and the end product is similar to a very fine mince			1
another more high pressure technique , which produces a meat ' slurry ' or paste , was also used to bulk - out burgers , sausages and pies in @entity6 until april 2012 , when the labelling law and ban was brought in			1
the @entity17 treat both processes the same , but it appears it may still be hidden inside cheap foods and not labelled as required legally			1
minced beef and lamb produced this way were banned completely over fears it could spread @entity133 , but not pork , chicken and other meats			0
managing director of @entity138 , a @entity6 - based meat and poultry trader admitted : ' we supply that product , i ca n't say who we supply it to or what they do with it , but we supply that product			1
' well we buy and sell it , we 're not responsible for the end labelling and what goes on meat contents and things like that , ' he said when asked by the @entity85 if it is being put in food secretly			0
the @entity6 's biggest private frozen sausage company , @entity157 , said in a statement : ' some @entity61 meat is used in our own branded product that goes into the foodservice market			1
where used , this is clearly declared '			0
@entity166 sausage maker @entity164 has been campaigning against these meats for years			0
the @entity6 should not be using this @entity168 meat but as far as i am aware it is coming into the country and is being used , ' he said			2
a spokesman for the @entity173 told @entity174 : ' knowing that a product is " baader meat " is not enough to decide whether it is legal or illegal			0
baader meat is a generic term used to describe the product of a mechanical separation process using a baader machine			0
this product can fall into various categories under @entity17 food law , depending on the raw material used , so can be used legally by food businesses in certain circumstances			2
' discovery : a billboard showing a hot dog is seen in a parking at the @entity194 store in @entity195 as the furniture giant announced it was withdrawing wiener sausages in the @entity6 after tests found ' indications ' of horse meat furniture giant @entity194 yesterday said it is withdrawing wiener sausages in the @entity6 after tests found ' indications ' of horse meat just days after it withdrew a batch of its traditional meatballs			2
the announcement came hours after the boss of @entity208 was forced to admit he still could not guarantee that all of his products contain exactly what is on the label as he fought to reassure the public over the scandal			0
@entity194 said it was removing its sausages from sale in @entity6 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 after tests confirmed ' a few indications of horse meat '			2
a spokeswoman said : ' based on some hundred test results that we have received so far , there are a few indications of horse meat			0
' together with the @entity232 supplier in question we have decided to withdraw from sales also the wiener sausages ... from that supplier			0
' technique : machinery produced by companies like @entity61 is used by companies to strip bones of meat			0

product stripped from bones is *re-named* ' 3mm mince ' or ' @entity248 '
it is then sold to @entity6 - despite @entity17 ban brought in last april
some mechanically separated meats allowed as long it is clearly labelled
but suppliers admit it may not be in ingredients because of loophole
