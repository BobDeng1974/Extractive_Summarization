by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 22 march 2013 letter : the @entity2 has evicted a farmer from his @entity5 estate because the rent was a day late for almost two centuries his family has run a farm on the @entity2 ’s famous @entity5 estate			1
@entity10 himself was born on @entity12 , and has spent his life working hard to earn a living there – the seventh generation of his family to do so			2
but now the farmer has been evicted from his @entity19 home – all because of a rent payment that was one day late mr @entity10 , 63 , suffers from parkinson ’s disease and blames his condition for forgetting to pay around £ 2,000 in overdue rent			1
the day after the final payment date , officials from the estate visited the farm to serve mr @entity10 and his wife @entity28 , 61 , with a ‘ notice to quit ’			1
the farmer immediately paid up the arrears , insisting he had simply been forgetful – but the estate terminated the tenancy anyway			1
after prolonged negotiations , and despite pleas for sympathy to the @entity2 himself , the family were forced to sell their animals and hand over the farmland to a neighbour			0
they have been told they must be out of their home by monday			0
the @entity46 have been shocked by their treatment			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ i was not ready to hang my clogs up			1
they have not got a shred of humanity or sympathy in them			0
it has ripped my life apart			0
’ the couple and their 17 - year - old daughter @entity57 have already found another home to rent eight miles away , leaving other members of the family at @entity62 for the time being			2
but mrs @entity65 ’s son @entity64 , 32 , his partner @entity66 and their children @entity67 , seven , @entity70 , five , and @entity71 , 15 months , fear being left homeless			2
they are preparing to leave too and hope to be given a council house soon			0
mr @entity10 claimed the estate had also been similarly ‘ ruthless ’ in their dealings with other farmers			1
@entity78 founded the farm back in 1830 when he developed it from moorland			0
the farm was passed from one generation to the next through the centuries as @entity5 was also passed to successive @entity84			2
@entity5 : mr @entity10 's family have run a farm on the @entity2 's estate for 183 years mr @entity10 ’s father @entity88 , 89 , ran the farm under four different @entity2 before retiring			1
he wrote to the current 12th @entity2 appealing to let his son stay			0
but that letter , along with one written by mr @entity10 himself , was never acknowledged			1
‘ the @entity2 has shown us no respect at all , ’ said mr @entity10			1
‘ the way we have been treated is absolutely outrageous			0
’ shocked : @entity97 's sufferer @entity10 and his wife @entity28 the farmer had been in the second generation of a ‘ three generation ’ long - term tenancy deal at the 200 - acre farm			1
mr @entity10 said he had hoped to negotiate a new five - year business tenancy with the estate , but in october 2011 discussions were brought to an end and they were given 18 months ’ notice to leave			1
but that agreement was ended when he failed to pay his six - monthly rent on time			2
it had previously been run as a dairy farm , but the family diversified in recent years and ran a charity helping people with learning disabilities and problem children by allowing them to visit the farm , complete with its cattle , sheep and poultry			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ they were saying the land was not tidy and the hedges and walls were not in place and things like that			1
they were also not happy about us running the charity from here			0
’ his wife added : ‘ we have been appallingly treated , but we are not the first farmers to be forced out			0
’ the couple hope to continue running the charity from their new home , which comes with a smallholding			2
@entity137 , chief executive of the @entity138 who was involved in negotiating with the estate , said the @entity2 ’s estate has been ‘ quite benevolent ’ in the past and is now ‘ more commercial in its approach ’ and ‘ more aggressive ’ in its rate reviews with farmers			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 estate said : ‘ it is a very complicated and difficult situation and due to the circumstances we can not discuss any details for legal reasons			2
’ he said the land was now being farmed by neighbouring tenants who were ‘ slowly bringing the land back into condition ’			0
heritage : mr @entity10 's grandfather , also called @entity10 , with a horse - drawn cart			1

@entity10 and @entity65 served with ' notice to quit ' @entity5
@entity97 's sufferer mr @entity10 , 63 , forgot to pay £ 2,000 in overdue rent
he immediately paid up after being served with the notice
but the couple 's tenancy was terminated by the estate anyway
