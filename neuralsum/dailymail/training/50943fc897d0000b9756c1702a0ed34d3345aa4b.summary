an @entity1 textile magnate who made a fortune from his clothing empire is making sure the rest of the world knows about his success - by having a shirt made out of pure gold			1
although he left school without any qualifications @entity11 created a multi-million pound textile business in @entity1			1
and now , to celebrate his upcoming 45th birthday on friday , he has commissioned the solid gold shirt that weighs more than four kilos			1
' and after paying just £ 127,000 to buy the gold and have it turned into a golden shirt , he thinks he got a good deal			1
according to local media the gold shirt has really got him noticed as he marched along the streets of his home in @entity43 , 260 km from the city of @entity34			2
he says he gets both admiring looks from women and envious looks from men			0
he said : ' i never go out with less than two to three kilos of gold jewellery			2
and now , to celebrate his upcoming 45th birthday on friday , he has commissioned the solid gold shirt that weighs more than four kilos ' i have always been fascinated with gold since i was five - years - old and studying in school			1
and over the years that interest has become a real passion			0
so it was logical that i would want to make my 45th birthday a golden affair			0
' in fact even on my wedding 23 years ago a lot of people said it was embarrassing that i was wearing more gold than my bride , but i just love the @entity68 metal			0
' the shirt that has seven solid gold buttons is due to be officially modelled by the clothing magnate on friday , but he tried it on in advance after collecting it from the @entity75 at @entity76 in @entity34 , where a team of around 20 craftsmen collectively spent 3,200 hours over the past two months to ' stitch ' it together			2
the gold used in the shirt has an 18 - 22 carat purity , without any other metals , and he added : ' before the taxman starts coming round , i can guarantee that every bit is properly recorded in my company accounts			2
' last year wealthy @entity88 has splashed out £ 14,000 on a solid gold shirt to make sure he 's a 24 karat hit with women in central @entity1 despite being made of gold the shirt has been so carefully made that it is as flexible as a normal shirt , he claims , and also just as comfortable because there is a thin cloth lining the inside			1
he said : ' it is easily washed and can be hung up to dry just like a normal piece of clothing , and a good a lifetime guarantee with it so that if it 's torn or damaged it will quickly be repaired			0
' after leaving school early before graduating he had thrown all of his efforts into developing the family garments business in @entity43 , a town of some 60,000			2
he is married to wife @entity112 and has sons @entity113 , 22 , and @entity115 , 19 , both now in college , and added : ' i am the only one in the family that seems so passionate about gold , the rest of my family is neither impressed or interested in gold			0
they just accept that it 's my passion and it 's part of our domestic life			0
my more extended family however think i 'm a bit weird but i guess that 's families			0
' he is a local politician himself and despite criticism that he flaunts his wealth among people who are poorer , he is actively involved in community projects and recently funding 120 operations for polio suffers at the @entity137 of @entity138 in @entity139			0
' i spend at least a week each year offering voluntary services at the 1,000 - bedded hospital , the biggest and best for polio treatment in @entity1			1
i also arrange for any requirements of the poor patients like food , medicines , surgery and blankets , from which i get immense satisfaction , ' @entity11 said			1
and he added : ' i admit you need to be brave to wear a shirt like this , brave and also in possession of a gun like my fully licensed revolver which i also carry with me every time i go out			0
' and the cost of the gold shirt is reportedly a fraction of what he has splashed out to make sure the birthday party is a spectacular affair , with hundreds of guests including @entity166 tourism minister @entity165 of the @entity167 ( @entity167 ) and around a dozen mps from various parties and @entity1 celebrities .			1
