first lady @entity0 will not take questions from reporters or give interviews during her tour of @entity5 that begins today , and members of the press corps who usually follows the first family everywhere ca n't travel with her entourage			1
and although she will make a few speeches with reporters in the room , the picture is largely one of an expensive , taxpayer - funded tourism exercise for mrs. @entity0 , her two daughters , and her mother – not the official trip the @entity19 has projected			1
@entity19 press officials have n't comment on the record about whether a reported ban on question - and - answer interviews applies equally to @entity25 journalists and international reporters			2
and limited information made available to @entity28 suggests that only two out of 22 scheduled events on the trip will afford journalists a chance to do any significant reporting – including a solitary speech – but still without interviewing mrs. @entity0			1
both of those events , the @entity19 says , will afford ' limited ' space for the press			0
first lady @entity0 jets off to @entity5 today with her daughters and her mother , on a trip that will likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in @entity44 protection mrs. @entity0 is used to having reporters around on @entity46 , but her staff have shut journalist out of her @entity5 junket ' how does this comport with the standards of an " official " trip that uses government resources ? ' @entity28 asked			1
' does n't this look more like a vacation at taxpayer expense if she 's not going to interface with the media ? ' @entity19 travel can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars since members of the president 's family must take a phalanx of @entity44 agents with them wherever they go			1
those agents and their staffers need hotel rooms , rental vehicles and per diem meal expenses			0
the cost of operating a government aircraft large enough for that entourage is also significant			2
but the @entity19 has met most questions about the trip with silence , leaving a monday conference call with reporters , one full of official political overtones , as the only official comment that reporters can write about			0
an email to journalists with a preview of events in @entity5 carries the ominous warning ' for planning purposes only / not for reporting ' and describes the limited media access for each of her appearances			0
as a result , @entity28 ca n't report on its contents , other than to summarize the number of press opportunities available			0
even that required special permission from a @entity19 official			0
nine of them are photo - opportunities , including six where only a single ' pool ' photographer will have any access			2
mrs. @entity0 's arrival and departure from three @entity5 cities will be ' open press , ' but are likely to consist of a wave from an airport tarmac			1
@entity0 has taken questionable trips at huge taxpayer expense before , including her annual jaunt -- with her children but without the president -- to @entity115 for @entity117 weekend skiing two events are closed to the press entirely ; two will only permit a single ' pool ' reporter to attend and watch ; press access for one is still to be decided			1
there are only two events during the trip that are completely open to journalists , but the @entity19 has indicated that the first lady wo n't be interviewed or take questions during those appearances , and they are marked ' space limited ' on her itinerary			2
' throughout the week she will participate in open press and pooled events including speeches at two schools , questions from students online and forums including a @entity139 , ' a @entity19 official told @entity28			1
but the @entity0 administration has left journalists with the impression that while she will face very limited press scrutiny , mrs. @entity0 is attempting to affect bilateral relations with @entity5			1
no reporters are traveling on the government aircraft that whisks her and her family members to the @entity147 today			2
' the most powerful message we can deliver [ to the @entity5 people ] is one of the examples of not just the first lady ’s life story but of @entity25 and our values , ' deputy national security adviser @entity148 told reporters during the monday call			2
' that alone i think speaks to things like respect for human rights that are interwoven into the dna of the @entity25			0
' good will ambassador ? when @entity0 speaks in public , even to a @entity168 , she often carries the official trappings of the @entity19 with her -- leading many to look for political ties to her @entity5 trip mrs. @entity0 played a @entity19 - official role on friday when vice president @entity173 ( c ) greeted @entity175 prime minister @entity174 ( @entity176 ) @entity177 , chief of staff to @entity178 when she was the first lady , told the @entity179 that ' politics can be imposed ' on trips like mrs. @entity0 's , and that ' people will want to put a political spin ' on it			1
the @entity5 trip is n't the first junket for the first lady and her daughters : @entity188 traditionally take a president 's @entity190 trip every year while president @entity0 golfs in @entity192 and @entity193 , chief of staff to @entity194 during her time in the @entity19 , said that since the trip will have ' a very tightly controlled schedule , and there is no media and no interviews , ' mrs. @entity0 might be able to avoid getting political			1
@entity148 began monday 's telephone briefing with a statement that sounded more like politics than vacation planning			0
he later insisted that the @entity19 would n't comment on the quasi-official trip 's cost to taxpayers			0
' first of all , as you all know , the bilateral relationship between the @entity25 and @entity5 is really as important as any relationship in the world , ' he said			0
' @entity5 of course now is the second - largest economy in the world			0
it 's our fastest - growing trading partner , and it ’s also a country we cooperate with on a whole host of international issues			0
... we 're very clear when we have differences with @entity5 on a host of issues , so it 's a relationship that allows for both a constructive cooperation , and candor when we disagree			0
' he also told reporters on the call that mrs. @entity0 will ' be staffed from our office , and as with our other trips , with staff and who know the area that we ’re going to			2
' @entity231 , mrs. @entity0 's chief of staff , added that the first lady 's planned ' people - to - people ' exchanges in @entity5 are ' not only good for those individuals , ' but ' it is really vital for the competitiveness of our @entity25 global economy			1

the first lady is taking her mother and daughters to three @entity5 cities on a ' people - to - people exchange ' trip at taxpayer expense
only 2 out of 22 events on her *calendar* will give reporters the chance to hear her speak and do any real reporting – but without interviewing her
no reporters are allowed to travel with the first lady on her government aircraft
the @entity19 is *declining* to say how much the week - long excursion will cost
mrs. @entity0 will appear for photo - ops and public events that are ' pooled press ' – just one reporter or photographer noting her comings and goings
