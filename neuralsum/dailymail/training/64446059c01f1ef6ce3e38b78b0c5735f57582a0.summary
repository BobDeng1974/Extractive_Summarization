by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent justice secretary @entity2 , pictured , is said to be furious after @entity4 judges made it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in @entity8 from claiming legal aid human rights judges sparked anger yesterday by ruling it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in @entity8 from claiming legal aid			1
to the fury of @entity2 , the @entity4 said introducing a residence test to tackle abuses of taxpayers ’ money was ‘ unlawful and discriminatory ’ and pandered to prejudice			1
the justice secretary had brought in measures , due to be enacted next month , to prevent overseas nationals receiving public money for civil claims until they have lived in @entity8 for at least a year			1
he took urgent action after ‘ disturbing ’ claims emerged that a group of @entity29 whose lawyers secured millions in legal aid had actually conspired to allege @entity8 soldiers executed and tortured prisoners			2
currently there are no nationality or residence restrictions on funding , which leaves @entity8 with a huge annual bill of £ 2billion			0
but in a highly unusual move , lord justice moses – who last year branded the legal aid reforms a ‘ joke ’ – shot down the laws before they had even come into force			2
invoking the controversial @entity46 , he ruled the radical crackdown was ‘ not lawful ’ and banning foreigners from accessing legal aid breached their rights to a fair trial and not to face discrimination			0
in an extraordinary ruling , he said mr @entity2 ’s claim that the curbs were vital to ‘ command public confidence ’ amounted to ‘ little more than reliance on public prejudice ’			0
the @entity59 said it intended to appeal the ruling			0
but mr @entity2 was understood to be furious			0
a source said : ‘ it ’s not fair to expect @entity8 taxpayers to pay the legal bills of people who have barely stepped over the border			0
‘ the residence test is a common sense approach that required people to have a strong connection to the @entity8 before they could be given civil legal aid			1
’ the government pushed the new laws through @entity74 last wednesday after concerns over the @entity78 inquiry into claims @entity8 troops abused prisoners in @entity29			0
the scandal of legal aid was highlighted by the @entity82 yesterday when an @entity84 farmer won permission to use taxpayers ¿ money to sue the @entity72 for sending aid to his homeland after a year - long hearing , which cost taxpayers £ 23million , the case sensationally fell apart in march when lawyers for the @entity29 admitted there was no evidence in a central claim – that insurgents were murdered			2
it is claimed the @entity29 – who have no residency rights in @entity8 and all live overseas – would never have got up to £ 10million in legal aid if the full facts had been known at the time			2
the scandal of legal aid was highlighted by the @entity82 yesterday when an @entity84 farmer won permission to use taxpayers ’ money to sue the @entity72 for sending aid to his homeland			2
the 33 - year - old – granted anonymity to protect his family – successfully argued foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘ brutal treatment ’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land			0
now the ruling , by three judges , opens the doors for legal aid lawyers based in @entity8 to trawl overseas to find more cases to bring against the authorities			1
judges at the @entity4 , pictured , said introducing a residence test to tackle abuses of taxpayers ' money was ' unlawful and discriminatory ' and pandered to prejudice the legal challenge came from the legal charity @entity132 , which said the test would discriminate against migrants as well as ‘ those unable to prove past residence including women fleeing domestic violence , pre-school age children and the homeless ’			1
but the @entity59 said exceptions from the residence test would have included asylum seekers , children , vulnerable people including victims of domestic violence and forced marriages , and refugees			0
a @entity59 spokesman said : ‘ legal aid is paid for by @entity8 taxpayers and we do not believe it is fair that people without a strong connection to the @entity8 should be eligible for civil legal aid when it is funded by taxpayers ’ hard - earned money			1
‘ the government believes that , in principle , people should have a strong connection to the @entity8 in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme and that the residence test we proposed is a fair and appropriate way to demonstrate that connection			1

ruling makes it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in @entity8 from claiming legal aid
the @entity4 says residence test would be ' unlawful and discriminatory '
justice secretary wanted measures to prevent abuses of taxpayers ' money
@entity2 said to be ' furious ' about the *decision* and an appeal is likely
