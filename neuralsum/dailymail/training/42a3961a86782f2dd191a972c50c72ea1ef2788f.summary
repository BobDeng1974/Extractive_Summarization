a new study , aimed at discovering the positive effects of break - ups , has suggested it takes three months to get over a relationship falling apart			1
@entity5 published in @entity7 magazine , @entity8 , found that it takes 11 weeks to feel the beneficial effects of a relationship split			1
this follows previous findings that it could take up to six months to be able to move on			1
they found that 71 per cent of people began to see the positives in the split in just a short period of time			1
those who 've made it through the initial three months after a break are described as having left ' the recovery zone ' , a period of painful adjustment and healing			1
@entity18 and @entity19 found that people started to feel better about themselves and developed strong coping strategies beyond the 11 week mark			1
however , this research may only apply to short term relationships			2
a different study that questioned how long it would take couples to get over a divorce found the time frame was significantly longer			1
it takes an average of 18 months to recover from the trauma of divorce , says dating site @entity50 dating site @entity51 found that it takes an average of 18 months to get over a marriage breakdown , which is six times longer than @entity18 and @entity19 's estimate			1
this may be because a marriage is considered a more serious commitment			2
of those questioned by the website one in six said they found it hard to deal with the feelings of failure			2
and while 43 per cent of people said that they felt a sense of relief when their divorce came through 31 per cent said that they still felt a sense of sadness			1
if you find yourself suddenly alone , do n't despair			2
relationship expert and self help guru dr @entity73 gives her tips for healing the heartache ... 1			0
do n't blame yourself remind yourself regularly that the relationship ended because your partner had the problem with communicating , which was nothing to do with you			0
you were willing and able to talk about your problems but your partner could n't deal with that ... which is their loss			0
take up something new it 's important that it 's completely unrelated to your ex , and even better if it 's something they did n't want you to do ! so many people who 've had these sort of break - ups keep doing the same things they did with their ex , which just increases their pain			1
leave those things until much later , when the pain of the break - up has faded			0
date for fun now 's not the time to look for another meaningful relationship			0
enjoy your friends , go out with interesting people , but put all thoughts of a replacement relationship out of your mind			2
do n't be a relationship bore spend more time with your friends and family by all means , but try not to keep going over the break - up with them again and again			0
much as they love you and want you to be happy , even they ca n't be expected to stick around if you 're constantly going over the same ground			0
you need your friends , so do n't scare them away ! 5			0
work on your ' i do n't care ' attitude even if you do still deeply care about your ex , with practise this will really help speed up your recovery			0
focus on all the annoying things they used to do ; try and decide what used to irritate you the most			0
soon you 'll be amazed to find you really do n't care any more .			0
