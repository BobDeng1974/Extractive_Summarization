by @entity0 children are reaching puberty five years earlier than a century ago as obesity interrupts hormonal changes in the body , a study has found			1
the onset of puberty in girls was 14.6 years in 1920 , compared to 10.5 in 2010 , researchers have found			1
while in boys , sexual maturity consistently occurred around a year later than their female peers			2
the scientists behind the study at @entity16 found the childhood obesity epidemic could be to blame as weight gain causes harmful changes to a child 's hormone levels , allowing puberty to happen earlier			1
a new study has found a link between obesity and the declining age of puberty , especially in girls past studies have suggested early puberty could increase a child 's chance of suffering cancer and other serious health problems later in life			1
the team studied hormone levels in 347 schoolchildren aged five to 15 years old			1
they found a child who is heavier at five tends to have lower levels of a protein called sex hormone - binding globulin ( @entity44 ) , and reaches puberty sooner			1
the tendency was more striking in girls than boys , the team noted			1
the study focused on the role of @entity44 , in children			2
@entity44 binds to the sex hormones androgen and oestrogen and while levels are initially high in childhood , they decline significantly before puberty , to allow sexual maturity to happen			2
researchers have suggested that hormonal disturbances associated with weight gain - combined with inflammation - could be the biological mechanism that explains the link between obesity and the declining age of puberty			2
lead researcher , professor @entity69 , at @entity70 and @entity71 , said : ' there are critical windows early in life which the die is cast for our long term health			0
scientists found hormonal changes and inflammation as a result of being overweight affect levels of a protein @entity44 , causing puberty earlier ' we know that weight gain often begins early and we wanted to investigate how early weight gain might be linked to earlier puberty			1
' here we have found compelling evidence that hormonal effects of obesity , and associated inflammation , affect levels of @entity44 and hence the age when puberty commences			1
' as a higher proportion of youngsters around the world have become obese , the age of puberty dropped			2
we now know that the relation between these issues is more than coincidental			0
' these findings have significant implications for children ’s development and public health around the world			0
' reduction in the age of puberty , as a result of early weight gain , expedites physical and psychosocial development at a younger age , and this potentially means an earlier ability to reproduce as well as poorer long term adult health			0
' the observed effects on puberty are another reason to take action against childhood obesity			0
' the findings also open a debate about the role of the worldwide obesity epidemic in the general lowering of the age of puberty			0
the @entity126 recognises childhood obesity as one of the most serious global health challenges for the 21st century			0
figures from the @entity133 ’s @entity132 show that almost a third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of four to five year olds were either obese or overweight			0
worryingly , as well as now identified as contributing to the lowering age of puberty , obesity in childhood also increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes in later life			0
the study was published in the @entity147 .			0

study at @entity16 studied school children aged five to 15 years
found children who were obese at five had lower levels of specific protein and reached puberty sooner
tendency was more striking in girls than in boys , study found
