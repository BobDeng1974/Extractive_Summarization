by @entity0 a new trend is seeing men wearing increasingly short shorts , with clothing companies following suit in order to meet demand			1
while the @entity9 and early @entity10 may have been about keeping covered up in knee - skimming bottoms , these days it 's becoming more and more fashionable for men to flaunt their thighs - as evidenced by street - stylers and celebrities including @entity16 and @entity17			0
the craze is especially relevant in an age where muscle - building work - outs like @entity21 and @entity22 are all the rage - which @entity24 says he had in mind when he co-founded men 's clothing company chubbies			0
who wears short shorts ? a new trend is seeing men wearing increasingly short shorts			1

instead , his @entity46 - based company , which he started in 2011 with three other men in their twenties , specializes in shorts that are stylishly shorter			2
indeed , chubbies exclusively sells shorts with a five - and - a - half - inch inseam , which falls just in the middle of the thigh			1
unlike the slouchy and disheveled cargo shorts of yesteryear , @entity50 ' modern ones are ' comfortable , flexible , aerodynamic and most of all utterly radical , ' reads the website			2

' @entity65 is another mens retailer that has hopped on the short shorts bandwagon			1

higher and higher : @entity65 sells chino shorts in four different inseam lengths : 11 , nine , seven ( left ) and five inches ( right ) , the last of which is most popular with twenty - something men thigh - skimming : at @entity78 , shorts that fall above the knee are more the norm than the exception , with inseams ranging between a conservative nine - and - a - half inches ( left ) to a more daring six ( right ) the modern fit is more tailored and less tight than the short shorts of the @entity84 and @entity85 - like the bright gym shorts favored by @entity87 and @entity89 's denim cut - offs in @entity89			1
' i just do n't like the longer lengths - they cut off your body in a strange place ' today , according to @entity97 , the vice president of design at @entity65 , different types of men tend to gravitate towards different lengths			0
those who opt for five inches are ' the same young guys wearing the slim - cut suits , ' who are often in their twenties , he said			0
the 11 - inch inseams , on the other hand , are preferred by teens who may be less comfortable revealing too much leg , as well as less interested in being on - trend			2

@entity129 - based designer @entity128 , who owns his own eponymous menswear label , says the logic behind short shorts for men is simple - they 're more flattering			1
' i just do n't like the longer lengths , ' he explained			0
' they cut off your body in a strange place			0
' as if ! long gone are the days where boys would ' just fall out of bed and put on some baggy pants , ' in the words of @entity146 from 1995 movie @entity147 ( pictured : a scene from the film )			0
