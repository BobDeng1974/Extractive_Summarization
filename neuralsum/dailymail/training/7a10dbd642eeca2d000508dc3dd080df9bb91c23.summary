by @entity0 published : 15:30 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 15:01 est , 17 july 2013 strolling down the sunny @entity5 streets , @entity2 and his friend @entity3 look like two average all - american kids			1
but as the son of @entity9 , arguably @entity10 ’s most esteemed member , @entity9 , 18 , is the ‘ worst person ’ for @entity3 to become close to , according to her father			1
@entity14 , 55 , who has not seen his two children for the past nine years since being ex-communicated from the church , told @entity17 : ‘ if there is any chance that @entity3 is connected to @entity9 , he is the worst person for her to be around			1
the more she ’s around him , the deeper into the church she goes			0
warning : @entity24 's estranged father @entity14 has said he thinks it is dangerous for her to be too close with @entity2 , the son of @entity10 bigwig @entity9 buddies : @entity2 and @entity24 pose for a cheeky photo alongside a friend			1
the striking brunette is believed to be dating dj @entity30 hanging out : @entity24 joins pals including @entity2 at a fairground the former @entity34 rugby league player joined @entity10 in 1978 and left in 2005 – and has since then been an outspoken critic of the mysterious religion			1
and he said he was wary of a list star @entity9 mainly because of his close friendship to @entity10 leader @entity39 , adding : ‘ @entity9 and @entity39 are like twins – they ’re like two peas in a pod			1
' i think @entity9 he has turned a blind eye to issues with his church			2
and they have been very careful not to show him the dark side			0
’ @entity14 was a professional footballer and almost 20 when he joined @entity10 after he believed the church had healed a long - running groin injury			1
he married fellow scientologist @entity52 in 1985 , the mother of actors @entity55 and @entity56 , and the couple went on to have a son @entity58 , now 27 , and @entity3 , now 25			2
' @entity9 and @entity39 are like twins - they 're like two peas in a pod ... i think @entity9 has turned a blind eye to issues with his church ' following the breakdown of his marriage , @entity14 , a plain - speaking @entity34 who now lives in @entity65 , @entity66 , started to question the church and the religion that had been part of his life for so long			1
after ' 18 years of constant learning and exorbitant costs ’ , @entity14 estimates he had paid out to ‘ close to $ 400,000 ’ on @entity10 services and sources for him and his wife			2
@entity14 told how the couple were invited to an event in @entity80 in 1996 by @entity81 where he alleges they were informed the church had developed a ‘ more exact approach to the @entity86 and corrected the system , therefore all prior spiritual services or courses that were done by you over the last 18 years was incorrect and hindered your results			2
‘ this new system was called @entity94 of technology and would cost another $ 20,000 for @entity14 and @entity52 to correct the past			0
the tipping point came , said @entity14 , when he was on business in @entity100 and was called by one of the @entity103 ’s executives in @entity66 ’s ‘ @entity104 ’ and ordered to arrive in @entity66 within 24 hours – or he would be considered a @entity105 for non-compliance			0
this , @entity14 said , he simply did not want to comply to – and was indeed told to leave			0
' no religion has the right to ruin you and split up your family ' : furious @entity14 hits out as he reveals he has not been able to speak to his two children for the past nine years after being ex-communicated from the @entity114 siblings : that @entity117 star @entity116 with his sister @entity3 and brothers @entity56 and @entity58 at a @entity121 event in @entity122 , @entity5 , in 2006 twins : @entity14 says that @entity9 and @entity10 leader @entity39 are like ' peas in a pod ' - and says the @entity103 should not have ' p * * * ed off ' the @entity127 star @entity126 @entity3 , now a striking brunette who has most recently been dating dj @entity30 , and her siblings were educated within @entity10 , as were @entity9 and his sister @entity130			1
and and records show she – alongside her mother and brothers – have each donated $ 35,000 of their own money to the church to reach @entity137 status within the past few years			0
being shut out of the church in 2005 meant that @entity14 has not seen his children – including the step - sons he helped raise – for the past nine years			1
indeed , he only found out about his daughter ’s friendship with @entity2 after following her on @entity143			2
' if my daughter has a brain , she should say ‘ how can my father be an evil person ? ' is @entity126 evil ? come on ! could all of these people be lying about the church ? ' ‘ i have to follow my kids on @entity143 because all my photos are with my ex-wife , i never thought i would have to be digging for photos of them online , ’ said @entity14			2
‘ and then someone contacted me to let me know a picture had gone viral of her with @entity2			0
‘ if @entity3 is hanging around with someone like @entity9 , it will be very hard to realise what is wrong with the church – and want to leave			1
’ @entity14 , who last week told @entity10 blogger @entity163 : ‘ i call @entity9 the @entity164 — he ’s got a warped view of @entity10 and i do n’t want my daughter anywhere near him ’ – said he had been prompted to speak out in the wake of @entity126 ’s departure from @entity10 last week			1
hugs : @entity24 cuddles up to @entity2 and a friend during a night out he said : ‘ @entity126 is a strong girl with a ton of money , i knew her when she was 17 and she ’s a b * * * h on wheels if you p * * s her off ! ‘ i ’m in the position now where i have to keep a @entity180 alert for my children , they wo n’t take my phone calls , they wo n’t accept cards			0
‘ if my daughter has a brain , she should say ‘ how can my father be an evil person ? is @entity126 evil ? come on ! could all of these people be lying about the church ? ‘ her mother is a staunch supporter and once they have their hooks in you , there ’s no remorse			0
’ ‘ i ’m not perfect ’ , admitted @entity14 , who has remained single since his divorce , ‘ i did mistakes , but does that make me evil ? i fathered these children and raised my two step - sons and i hope one day they wake up and smell the coffee			2
@entity2 kicks back and spends quality time with female pal @entity24 soaking up the sun : @entity24 and her fellow scientologist pal @entity2 ‘ i grew up in @entity34 , i was beaten up because i was a foreigner and i fought in the @entity203 , i ’m a tough cookie			0
‘ but it is sad not to see my kids , to realise that i might now be able to walk my daughter down the aisle – it ’s heartbreaking			0
but i could walk away and say i raised those kids with the best of my ability and i never abused them and i loved them			0
’ now working in finance , @entity14 stressed : ‘ no religion has the right to ruin you and split up your family			0

former @entity219 player @entity14 was ex-communicated by the church in 2005 - and has not seen his children ever since
claims his daughter @entity3 is too close to @entity2 , son of a list star @entity9 , because ' the more she 's around him - the deeper in she gets '
