by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity2 and @entity1 could finally take to the ring in may 2015			1
a source close to @entity6 's father has said the undefeated @entity8 boxer is willing to face his @entity10 counterpart for the substantial money their fight will generate , according to the @entity15 website			1
' september 13 , back to business , @entity17 - @entity6 , part ii. and then in may , i 'm fighting in may and i 'll have a big surprise for you all , ' @entity6 has said previously			1
mayweather , though , is n't as keen to fight @entity1 , but is eager to rake in the money			1
@entity1 challenged @entity6 , telling him to put up or shut up			2
the hints of a may 2015 fight come two months after @entity1 extended his contract with promoter @entity45 , denting the chances of a @entity6 bout			1
@entity1 committed himself to @entity50 ’s outfit until the end of 2016 , by which time he will be 38 and considering retirement			0
the eight - division world champion ’s fights are shown on @entity55 in @entity8 , while @entity6 is contracted to rival @entity56 , meaning a fight between the two would be seemingly unlikely			2
@entity50 , however , claimed the $ 300million mega-fight could still happen			0
‘ we want to fight him and we ’re willing to discuss it at any point , ’ he said in may			0
‘ there are two ways to go here			0
one is to do a @entity6 fight with both @entity55 and @entity56 involved , as they did with @entity67 , as i understand @entity6 is under contract to @entity56 through 2015			2
the companies could come together and put on the show			0
‘ or , the other alternative is , if @entity6 wanted to fight @entity1 in 2016 , he could return to @entity55 and we could do it there			1
’ @entity74 tells @entity17 to put his money where his mouth is packing a punch : @entity6 came out on top the last time he faced @entity17 at the @entity38 in may			0

@entity79 and @entity1 fight could happen in may 2015
@entity6 is *tempted* by substantial money the fight would generate
' i 'm fighting in may and i 'll have a big surprise for you all , ' @entity6 said
