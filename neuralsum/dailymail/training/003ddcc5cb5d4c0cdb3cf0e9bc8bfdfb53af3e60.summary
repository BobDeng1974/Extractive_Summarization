thanks to the advent of new technology love letters are n't what they used to be			0
while handwritten letters sent in the post could once literally be ' sealed with a loving kiss ' , today an ' x ' or two at the end of an email or text can be as romantic as it gets			0
but now @entity15 , in association with @entity14 , are aiming to bring some love back into our correspondence			1
they have invented ' @entity20 ' as a way of ' humanising technology through emotive digital experiences '			0
they can do this by either capturing a picture of their lips on a desktop camera or by kissing their touch screen mobile			2
if you 're not able to provide a kiss of your own lips via a camera or touch screen , @entity15 also have their own ' quick kisses ' that can be sent			1
before sending their kiss , users can then chose what lip colour they want from @entity15 's range of shades including pinks , purples , nudes and reds			1
brought to life : an animated video allows users to see their letter winging its way to their loved one where 's the most romantic city ? the @entity15 map will reveal in real time where letters are being sent and received they can then add a personal message before sending their kiss off digitally to their nearest and dearest			1
but the fun does n't end there			0
the journey of each kiss is then brought to life through a personalisedanimation showing three - dimensional city skylines such as @entity85 and @entity86 , charting the delivery progress from the sender 's location to the recipient 's			0
the personal element is added with the use of @entity93 and @entity95 technologies to show the letter winging its way to its destination			1
for those who still do n't understand how to send a kiss , @entity15 have created a how to video , which you can view below , explaining how it works			1
the video features musician @entity105 singing ' @entity106 ' and stars up and coming @entity27 models @entity26 and @entity108			0
@entity109 features in the @entity111 campaign and the @entity113 pre-collection lookbook , and has walked several @entity15 runway shows while @entity108 features in the campaign for @entity15 â€™s watch collection @entity117 , launched in october 2012			1
male model @entity108 features in the latest campaign the @entity15 website has a real time ' @entity122 ' map so people can see where kisses are being sent around the globe and discover which city is the most romantic			2
@entity15 chief creative officer @entity128 explains why they came up with the idea			0
' we 're constantly thinking about how we translate the emotion of what we create and experience in the real world into the digital space , whether that 's capturing the energy and excitement of a live gig , the hum and buzz of anticipation before a runway show , or just the feeling you get when you pull on your trench coat on a rainy morning			0
' @entity20 began with the idea of giving technology a bit of heart and soul , and using it to unite the @entity15 family across the world - by telling a story that makes the digital personal			2

@entity27 brand have launched ' @entity15 kisses ' with @entity14
users can create kiss from their own lips using cameras and touch screens
@entity166 is then sent with personal message to loved one
@entity169 can track delivery with animation using @entity93
