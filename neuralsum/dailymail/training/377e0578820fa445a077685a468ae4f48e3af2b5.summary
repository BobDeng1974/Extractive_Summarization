by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:39 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 11:15 est , 12 april 2012 teenage hackers hijacked highly sensitive telephone conversations on @entity5 ’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on @entity7			1
@entity9 group @entity8 claimed responsibility and said it was ' easy ' to bypass the force 's security - which they said was ' from the 80s '			1
they claim to have compromised a server from @entity17 to record conversations			1
the force launched an investigation today after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked			1
scroll down for audio online presence : this image appears on the website of the @entity26 , urging members of the public to call the confidential anti-terrorist hotline the attack is the latest in a series of embarrassing security breaches , and comes after ' hacktivist ' group @entity34 brought down the official @entity36 website last saturday			1
@entity5 's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls before an @entity40 - sounding caller , using the name trick , told them they were being ' pranked '			1
detectives said ' appropriate action would be taken ' after a number of recordings were posted on @entity7			0
in one of the clips , a man identifying himself as @entity47 is heard telling an officer : ' knowledge is power ... we embarrass governments and f * * * the police			0
' the hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system			1
the ' @entity63 ' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group , @entity8			1
@entity66 phone networks - known as ' phreaking ' , a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges			1
' @entity75 ' was a predecessor to today 's hacking - @entity78 co-founder @entity77 was a ' phreaker ' himself in the early seventies			1
nowadays , computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer - hacking skills to ' get inside ' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls			1
' trick ' is later heard laughing when a woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being passed on to the @entity90			2
in another recording , officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while @entity8 listens in			2
the group claimed to have then made calls to @entity96 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the @entity26 's counter-terrorism command			1
a @entity26 statement said : ' we are aware of an issue whereby hoaxers have made calls to the anti-terrorist hotline and have made recordings of their conversations with anti-terrorist hotline staff			1

' the @entity26 has launched an investigation into this matter			2
' trick , reportedly a 17 - year - old who launched @entity8 in 2010 , said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from @entity17 to record conversations			1
a statement from @entity85 read : ' the phone denial of service was done via a custom script for @entity63 which was installed on an overseas server			2
' the conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method , their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique			1
' hacked : @entity5 has launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were recorded by hackers in response to the @entity5 statement , @ - @entity8 tweeted : ' oh really now			1
' when asked whether he found it simple to overcome @entity96 security , @entity47 emailed : ' yes it was easy : ) ' the group has been linked to alleged hacking attempts on @entity143 and a personal email account linked to a former staff member of @entity146 's			2
terror suspect : briton @entity148 has been fighting for the right to be tried in the @entity150 , but can now be extradited to the @entity40 @entity8 said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours , ensuring no other calls could get through			1
the group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by the @entity157 , which allowed @entity150 - linked terror suspects @entity148 and @entity159 to be extradited to @entity40			0
by targeting the phones , the group essentially carried out the telephonic equivalent of a denial - of - service ( @entity163 ) attack - an approach often used by online hackers against @entity168 websites			0
the audio recording released by @entity8 appears to feature an @entity96 officer saying , ' you are blocking these lines			2
people can not get through when you ’re constantly coming through here with your fun calls			0
' trick told download site @entity180 : ' every time they picked up the phone the server would play a robot voice which said " teampoison "			2
' in a recording thought to be the conversation between @entity47 and @entity96 officers , the teenager can be heard saying , ' my name is trick , i 'm from @entity8 - my name is @entity194 ' , before a female officer asks , ' what 's your date of birth , @entity199 ? ' april 4 , 1991 , ' he replies			1
a male voice is then heard wishing ' @entity199 ' ' happy birthday for last week ' , and asking if he received any nice presents			0
the hacker then changes tack , saying , ' i got some terrorism for you here			0
' challenged about his use of an @entity40 accent , the young man adds , ' i do n't brush my teeth , i like tea , i 'm from the @entity150			0
' ' what 's your actual philosophy ? ' asks the male official			0
' i 'm not actually familiar with it			0
' ' our philosophy is pretty simple : it 's knowledge is power , ' the hacker says			0
' and , uh , f * * k the po - lice			0
' the call is terminated as the female operative states , ' your information and everything about you is being passed to the @entity90			0
' another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features @entity96 staff discussing the group 's attack			2
@entity5 's anti-terrorist hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible terrorist activity , and has been the subject of several costly newspaper and radio advertising campaigns			0
a section of the @entity26 's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users : ' we want you to look out for the unusual – some activity or behaviour which strikes you as not quite right and out of place in your normal day to day lives			1
' you may feel it ’s probably nothing , but unless you trust your instincts and tell us we wo n’t be able to judge whether the information you have is important or not			0
' remember , no piece of information is considered too small or insignificant			0
' our specially trained officers would rather take lots of calls which are made in good faith , but have innocent explanations – rather than not getting any at all			0
' addressing concerns about secrecy , it goes on , ' we know you may have concerns about speaking to the police – possibly because your friends or family may find out			0
' but all information passed to the police is treated in the strictest of confidence			0
it is thoroughly analysed and researched by experienced officers before , and if , any police action is taken			0

@entity278 known as ' @entity8 ' claims responsibility , saying the @entity26 still used technology ' from the 80s '
teenage leader trick claims breach was ' easy ' and *accessed* up to 700 calls
anarchists used a @entity17 server to hack telephone networks
