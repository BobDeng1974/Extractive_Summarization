@entity1 prime minister @entity0 today sent a ritual offering to a controversial shrine in a move likely to impact on his plans to meet with @entity7 president @entity6			1
a group of other @entity1 lawmakers were also seen paying their respects at the @entity11 - condemned by @entity7 and @entity12 as honouring @entity1 's militarist past - to mark the start of the country 's autumn festival			1
there was no sign of cabinet ministers there , although local media said health minister @entity21 also sent an offering			0
a ruling party lawmaker tweeted that three ministers planned to visit the shrine tomorrow			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has risked angering @entity7 by sending an offering to @entity29 's controversial @entity28 , which they have demanded the leader not visit in person expectations have been growing in @entity1 that @entity0 , who outraged @entity34 and @entity35 by visiting @entity28 in person in december 2013 , will be able to meet @entity6 for talks next month at an @entity40 leaders ' summit in @entity34			1
signs of improving relations have been growing as both sides recognise the impact their fallout has on business and the risk it could escalate militarily			0
prospects for a leaders ' chat are clouded by @entity7 's demands that @entity0 not visit the shrine - where @entity1 wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an @entity56 tribunal are honoured along with millions of war dead			1
@entity0 today sent an offering of a small masakaki tree			0
a promise not to visit @entity28 again would be difficult for @entity0 , whose conservative agenda includes recasting @entity1 's wartime history in a less apologetic tone			1
@entity0 has previously said he visited the shrine not to glorify war , but to honour those who fought and died for their country			0
@entity0 it thought to be unlikley to visit the shrine ahead of the @entity40 leaders summet in november where he hopes to meet with @entity7 president @entity6 to improve relations between the two countries but since visiting in december last year , he has stayed away , and instead sent an offering on key dates , in an effort to improve relations with @entity7			1
@entity78 , a ruling @entity79 aide to @entity0 , said the prime minister was likely to refrain from visiting the shrine ahead of the november gathering in @entity34 because it was in @entity1 's national interests			1
@entity7 also wants @entity1 to acknowledge the existence of a formal territorial dispute over tiny islands in the @entity87 controlled by @entity1 but also claimed by @entity34			2
@entity7 president @entity6 also wants @entity1 to acknowledge the existence of a formal territorial dispute over tiny islands in the @entity87 controlled by @entity1 but also claimed by @entity34 @entity1 diplomatic experts ruled out such a move but said it was possible the two sides could find a diplomatic formula to ' agree to disagree ' over the uninhabited islands , known as the @entity95 in @entity1 and the @entity95 in @entity7			1
a slowing @entity7 economy and a sharp drop in @entity1 investment are key factors prompting @entity34 to rethink its relations with @entity29 , experts said			2
@entity1 firms ' investment in @entity7 fell 40 per cent on an annual basis in the first half of 2014 after sliding by nearly one - fifth last year			2
reduced tensions would also benefit @entity1 companies doing business in @entity7			2
a meeting with @entity6 would be a diplomatic coup for @entity0 who has travelled to around 50 countries since taking office , but has so far been unable to meet @entity7 or @entity115 leaders			1
@entity0 has also signalled that he wants to meet @entity115 president @entity116 at november 's leaders summit			2
persistent disputes over the legacy of @entity1 's 1910 - 1945 colonisation of the @entity121 have cast doubts on the likelihood of such a meeting			0
@entity7 - @entity1 relations have been strained since the 1937 @entity126 and what @entity7 sees as @entity1 's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there			0
@entity1 soldiers murdered tens of thousands , or hundreds of thousands , of @entity7 soldiers and civilians during the @entity135 , and were accused of raping local women and widespread looting			0
estimates of the death - toll range from 40,000 to 300,000 , but revisionists in @entity1 have contended it is much lower , and even that the event was entirely fabricated			0
@entity7 sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and @entity1 's reluctant to apologise as insensitive .			0

@entity1 prime minister @entity0 sent a a tree to the @entity148
@entity7 has demanded he not visit the *monument* in person
@entity0 hopes to meet with @entity7 president @entity6 next month
