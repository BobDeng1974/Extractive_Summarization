it might not answer the age - old question of whether the chicken or the egg came first , but biologists have located the spot where they think the first domestic chickens appeared			2
researchers claim to have found the earliest evidence for chicken domestication in an area around the @entity11 in northern @entity12			1
they obtained dna from 10,500 year old fossilised bones that confirmed they belonged to the same lineage as modern domestic chickens			1
the fossilised remains of domesticated chickens found at the @entity21 site in @entity22 , northern @entity12 , are closely related to the red jungle fowl , which is thought to have roamed the area at the time the researchers analysed fossilised chicken bones ( top right ) from four locations around north and east @entity12 with the oldest being found at the @entity21 archaeological site near the @entity11 the results show that the animals , found buried beneath a peat bog in @entity12 's @entity22 , @entity32 , are the oldest examples of domesticated chicken by several thousand years and traces of their genomes are still found in the birds sold in supermarkets today			1
it is thought that these birds spread out around @entity42 but later were bred with other ancient species of fowl to produce the modern domesticated birds that appear on our supermarket shelves today			2
the bones found in northern @entity12 were closely related to the red jungle fowl , @entity51 gallus gallus			1
professor @entity52 , a palaeogeneticist at the @entity53 and the @entity54 in @entity55 , said : ' these are really exciting results as they suggest that societies with mixed agriculture developed in northern @entity12 around the same time they did so in the @entity61			1
' our analyses also suggest that northern @entity12 represents one region of the earliest chicken domestication			2
domestic chickens sold in supermarkets today still contain same genetic elements in the mitochondrial dna as the birds that were domesticated in northern @entity12 more than 10,000 years ago ' chickens represent by far the most important poultry species , yet the number , locations , and timings of their domestication have remained controversial for more than a century			1
' our results these early domesticated chickens contributed to the gene pool of modern chicken populations			0
' moreover , our results support the idea that multiple members of the genus @entity51 , specifically @entity51 gallus and @entity86 ( grey jungle fowl ) contributed to the gene pool of the modern domestic chicken			1
' the scientists , whose results are published in the journal @entity92 , sequenced the mitochondrial dna from 39 chicken bones found at four different sites scattered around northern and east - central @entity12			1
modern domesticated chickens were found to share genetic similarities , or haplotypes , with other ground dwelling birds from around the world which allowed the scientists to trace their origins most livestock and pets we know today were originally tamed from the wild when humans began setting down in permanent settlements and began farming around 8,000 years ago			1
dogs are thought to have been first being bred for tameness around 15,000 years ago from wild wolves in @entity42			0
@entity112 began appearing as a domestic species of the mouflon in the @entity115 10,000 years ago			0
pigs were domesticated both in the @entity115 and in @entity12 around 8,000 years ago while cattle also appeared in the @entity115			0
brahman cattle are thought to have originated 6,000 years ago from wild species in @entity120			0
horses were domesticated from wild populations in many different places but were first thought to have appeared 6,000 years ago in @entity42 domesticated @entity124 began appearing in @entity125 around 4,500 years ago from their wild relatives the guanaco			0
these ranged from being between 2,300 years old and 10,500 years old			0
the researchers then compared the mitochondrial dna sequences with those from six different related fowl species along with ancient specimens found in @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
using phylogentic analysis , where the dna was used to trace the evolutionary relationship between the species , the scientists found that the bones from the @entity12 sites belonged to domestic birds			2
they were also closely related to taxonomic genus that includes modern domesticated chickens and wild red jungle fowl			1
the dna sequences found in the oldest bones from northern @entity12 were found to represent three major groups of mitochondrial dna that are present in the modern chicken gene pool			1
this suggests that there has been a continuous genetic line from these oldest domestic chickens and modern populations			2
many scientists had previously doubted whether the bones could belong to domesticated red jungle fowl as the area where they were found is too boggy and cold to be their usual habitat			1
however , around 10,000 years ago , the area would have looked very different with dense jungle thriving in a warm , humid climate			0
professor @entity167 , who led the research at the @entity169 , said : ' people argued that northern @entity12 did not provide suitable habitat for red jungle fowl , the wild ancestor of domestic chickens but they do not take into account that climate and vegetation were very different 10,000 years ago			1
' previously the oldest evidence of domesticated chickens dated back to around 7,000 years ago			0
however , the first animals thought to have been domesticated for livestock were sheep in the @entity115 around 11,000 years ago			0
previous research by professor @entity167 and his colleagues has shown , however , that other animals now commonly bred for human consumption were also originally domesticated in @entity12			0
they found that pigs were domesticated in the @entity191 county of @entity32 in northern @entity12 , also close to the yellow river around 7,300 years ago			2
evidence of barley and millet farming have also been found there			0
archaeologists have also found that ox may also have been first domesticated in @entity42 .			0

@entity200 *extracted* from fossilised bones found near to @entity11 in northern @entity12 were found to still exist in domestic species today
bones are oldest evidence of domestic chickens by up to 4,000 years
results suggest early @entity12 farmers captured and bred red jungle fowl
genetic analysis shows modern domestic chickens sold in shops are cross breeds from several different species of ancient fowl from around the world
