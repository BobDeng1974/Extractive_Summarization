by @entity0 , @entity1 fifteen - year - old @entity4 wild card @entity2 stunned @entity6 finalist @entity5 in the biggest upset of the @entity8 so far			1
@entity2 , the number two junior in the world , was making her grand slam debut and showed remarkable composure to win 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 4 against the 12th seed			1
@entity5 looked to be on her way to victory after recovering from a chastening first set to win the second and then lead 3 - 1 in the third			1
delight : the young star celebrates her win against the 12th seed in the @entity8 first round serving up a shock : although she is junior world no 2 , little was expected of the 15 - year - old wildcard but back came @entity2 and in her first ever tour - level match she broke the @entity5 serve in the final game to take victory in a raucous atmosphere on @entity28			1
@entity2 , ranked 1,208 , is the youngest player to win a match at the @entity8 since @entity31 in 1996			2
' i went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience , but i never thought i would come out on top , ' said the teenager , who next plays @entity38 @entity37			2
' it 's crazy to think that i 'm actually here right now with all these other people			0
i never thought i would be practising or sharing a court with a player that i watch on tv frequently			0
' strain : @entity5 looked to have sorted out her problems in the second set but @entity2 came back to win @entity2 ' amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 @entity4 dollars in prize money for a first - round victory , but she is in no rush to turn professional			1
she said : ' i think i 'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college , in case an injury or something happens			0
but i 'd love to be a pro one day			0
' wimbledon champion @entity60 avoided a repeat of 2011 in emphatic fashion with a 6 - 1 6 - 0 victory over @entity65			1
the first time the @entity66 won the @entity68 title three years ago she struggled to deal with the expectation and lost in the first round at @entity71			2
disbelief : @entity2 sinks to her knees after winning the final point of a pulsating match @entity60 , seeded third , went into the tournament with a title under her belt from @entity79 on saturday and is hoping to go beyond the fourth round for the first time			1
' the other grand slams are a big challenge for me right now to do a good result , ' she said			0
' especially here , where i do n't really have a good result			0
so i 'm really motivated to do well here			0
i remember 2011 when i lost my first round after winning @entity90 , so i 'm just glad that i 'm better already			2
' @entity91 showed once again that she is a different animal at the grand slams with a 6 - 2 6 - 1 victory over @entity95			1
determined : @entity60 performed better this time than the last time she came as @entity90 champion the seventh seed has won only won match since losing to @entity60 in the @entity90 final but put her shaky form behind her			1
' i 'm happy , ' said @entity91 , who has made at least the semi-finals at every grand slam this year			2
' it 's definitely never easy in the first round of a grand slam so i 'm happy to get a win under my belt			2
i want to get on a roll and keep the momentum going			0
' @entity91 only made her debut at the @entity8 last year , losing a close match to @entity112 in the second round			1
' i was just very excited to be on - site in the main locker room , all that stuff , ' recalled @entity91			1
' going into this one , i feel like the past few weeks have been a bit of a struggle			0
i do n't feel like i 'm putting too many high expectations on myself			0
but i have the inner confidence that if i 'm playing as well as i know i can , that i can do well			2
' experienced : @entity91 says she is much better prepared this year after a second round exit 12 months ago @entity122 survived a three - set tussle with @entity124 before grinding out a 6 - 7 ( 3/7 ) 6 - 4 6 - 1 win			1
@entity122 has lost to @entity126 in the final the last two years but the chances of her making it a hat - trick of finals look very slim			0
the @entity132 is only seeded 16th after a nightmare season of injury and poor form and made heavy weather of beating her diminutive @entity138 opponent			0
pleased : the @entity140 saw off @entity95 in straight sets , dropping just three games in the process there were no such problems for eighth seed @entity146 , who is back in the top 10 and having her best season since winning the @entity150 in 2008			0
the @entity151 eased past @entity4 @entity152 6 - 3 6 - 0 and next plays @entity66 @entity153			1
there were differing fortunes for two former champions , with @entity157 beating @entity158 6 - 1 6 - 4 but @entity159 marking the 10th anniversary of her title by losing in a third - set tie - break to @entity163			1
