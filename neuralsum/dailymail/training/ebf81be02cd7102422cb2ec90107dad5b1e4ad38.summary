' the two of us are really strong characters			2
i knew he had a lot of football knowledge that was unfairly tarnished			2
his knowledge meant he was too good to be a tv pundit , ' he said			1
' to get him back in the game was great			2
i love working with him , we have a laugh			2
' not everything is serious			0
i beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day			0
' when i was thinking about people to bring in , i know it probably raised a few eyebrows , ' how 's that going to work ? ' nobody sees the logic in it			1
i just knew in my gut it would work			0
alright , there will be times when we do n't win games but we 'll never break anything			0

' the @entity23 tunnel was pretty small at that time was n't it , there was no hiding place , ' he said			0
