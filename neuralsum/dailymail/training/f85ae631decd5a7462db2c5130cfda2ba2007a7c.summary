with a beauty industry saturated with lotions and potions promising to turn back the clock , treating fine lines and pigmentation on our face is already enough of a minefield			1
if the daily cleanse , tone and moisturise routine is already too much for you ( and that 's before you 've even considered serums , toners and oils ) , it 's about to get a lot more complicated			1
new ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are starting to hit shelves so that beauty buffs can give their mitts the same attention as their faces			1
another body part to worry about ! with hands being one of the most tell - tale signs of ageing , new ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are being rolled out but why do we need more products to add to our already lengthy beauty regime ? here 's why : as the years pass , skin on the hands thins , causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear			1
while make - up can disguise tell - tale signs of ageing on the face , it 's more difficult with hands - which is why it 's often said that hands are the best indicator of age			2
in fact , research by beauty firm @entity54 showed one in eight of us is more worried about our hands betraying our age than our faces			2
that 's where a new host of potent products come in that are designed to plump hands , beat wrinkles and reduce dark spots			1
damage done : as the years pass , skin on the hands thins , causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear new range : @entity72 has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health , such as the @entity76 ( £ 36.50 ) , which is packed with the all - important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and even a cleansing mask , right , to refresh hands one of the newest power players on the market is @entity84 - a brand dedicated to improving the firmness , elasticity , density , evenness , brightness , texture , smoothness and hydration of hands			1
their new @entity94 has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex , which includes a 99.5 per cent pure hyaluronic acid - an ingredient well - known for providing incredible hydration to skin			2
there 's also lots of other potent ingredients packed in there such as red marina algae , which apparently increases cell turnover , as well as tamarind to hydrate skin below the surface			2
@entity109 ( great for those on a budget at £ 3.99 from @entity112 ) , has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing			2
the hand cream contains glycerin and shea butter to diffuse active moisture into the skin and with its exclusive soy complex , the formula claims to visibly reduce the appearance of brown spots			1
day and night : @entity109 , which has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing , is great for daytime wear , while @entity133 's offering boots regeneration whilst you sleep the @entity134 also costs £ 3.99 and promises to enhance skin cell repair and regeneration overnight and helps protect skin ’s natural defences			1
@entity139 ’s £ 3.99 @entity138 helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and takes it one step further by helping to minimise the risk of further skin damages thanks to the built - in @entity146			1
@entity72 has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health			2
first up is the @entity150 ( £ 36.50 ) , which is packed with the all - important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and moisture retention			0
it even comes with specially designed cotton gloves to enclose hands after application to help the rich cream penetrate effectively while you sleep			2
potent : @entity84 's new @entity94 has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex , that is well known for providing incredible hydration to skin they also have a £ 22.25 @entity165 aimed at benefiting dry and damaged hands			1
it contains botanical extracts which remove impurities , refresh and invigorate , and aloe vera to calm and soften the skin			2
if that was n't enough , there 's the @entity174 for @entity175 ( £ 17.00 ) aimed at helping with pigmentary blemishes , which represent one of the major natural phenomena of ageing skin			2
hormonal changes and frequent exposure to the sun are to blame			0
so , with the passing of time , pigmentary blemishes , more commonly called brown spots , appear on the skin			1
the brand say their cream tones down and prevents the appearance of pigmentary blemishes			0
its botanical extracts ( strawberry begonia and mulberry root ) promise to help regulate the natural pigmentation , while an exfoliating agent and almond proteins allow a gentle peeling of dead skin overloaded with melanin , giving back radiance and suppleness			1
it 's hardly surprising that these new hand creams are big business			0
cosmetic surgery clinics have reported an 18 per cent increase in enquiries about anti-ageing procedures on their hands - proving how much of a concern it 's becoming			0
the new cosmetic surgery trend , which sees women having dermal fillers and laser resurfacing to reduce the signs of ageing , has been dubbed the banishing of ' @entity221 ' after popstar @entity221 , 55 , who has ' anti-aged ' almost every part of her body but often resorts to fingerless gloves to cover her hands			0
dr @entity226 , joint medical director and fat transfer specialist at @entity229 of @entity230 , said : ' it is common for women , as they grow older , to lose weight in their hands , which means that veins and wrinkles can become more evident			1
prolonged exposure to the sun will also speed up the ageing process			0
' and while treatments like laser resurfacing to target the signs of ageing , or traditional fillers to make the hands appear fuller and healthier , can offer effective results , these can really only ever offer a temporary solution			0
' a more long terms solution is fat transfer – a technique which is fast becoming one of the most popular for hand rejuvenation purposes			0
the procedure uses advanced technology to produce a pure and effective fat graft , which means that fat can safely be taken from one area of the patient ’s body , such as their thighs or stomach , and injected into the hands			0
' the fact that the procedure is minimally invasive is also an important factor			0
many patients have careers which do not allow for them to be away from work for long periods of time			0
fat transfer is a walk - in , walk - out procedure and one which is performed under local anaesthetic , so patients can undergo treatment without too much disruption to their lives			0
' over time i expect to see procedures such as this continue to grow in popularity , as women decide to invest further in different aspects of their appearance , later into life			0
' dr @entity289 , @entity290 at 111 @entity230 said : ' one piece of advice i always give my patients is that skincare should not stop at the jawline			0
this new category of products show that an increasing number of women , who perhaps have a regimented facial regime , are now taking steps to ensure that their hands do n’t give away tell - tale signs of age			1
' hands are exposed to the sun and environmental aggressors on a daily basis , and often age must faster than the face			0
' there is very little fat on the backs of the hands , so when even a small amount of collagen or elastin fibres begins to break down the dermis thins , causing veins to become more prominent , and the skin wrinkles			1
women who have conquered the unlined look above the face , still neglect their hands , and once that damage has been done , often non surgical treatments are the only options to restore volume in the skin			1
' filler is the most popular option , dubbed the ‘ hand lift ’ by my patients , and most of those who have this treatment are in their 40 ’s			0
i always prefer to use a patient 's fat , which means that there is very risk of causing an allergic reaction			0
this treatment , although a little more expensive than regular filler , is permanent			0
the results are unrivalled as the stem cells in the fat give the hands plumpness in addition to radiance			0
' for those concerned about age spots and pigmentation , injectables are not going to improve the hands condition			1
a laser resurfacing treatment like @entity353 can penetrate the top layer of skin , destroying brown spots and stimulating collagen production so that the skin looks smooth and even			1
it can be uncomfortable ; hands can be red and swollen for a few days following treatment but the pigmentation and brown spots will flake off in about a week – with permanent results			1
