a 300 - million - year – old fish that resembles a small shark could see its prehistoric surroundings in colour , palaeontologists claim			1
the fossilied eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision ever discovered in an animal			1
it is hoped that the discovery will enable scientists to pinpoint exactly when colour vision first evolved			1
a 300 - million - year – old fish ( pictured ) that resembles a small shark could see its prehistoric surroundings in colour			2
the fossilied eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision ever discovered in an animal ‘ this fossil fish eye is the first evidence to suggest animals saw in colour as early as 300 million years ago , ’ professor @entity20 , @entity21 at the @entity22 said			1
‘ it is the first case of colour vision in an ancient , extinct animal , proving colour vision existed a long time before the @entity33 period			1
’ this period stretched from approximately 200 to 146 million years ago			0
‘ the retina of this 300 million - year - old fish is very well preserved , enabling us to find the first record of cone cells and rods in animals			1
scientists scanned the tissues in the fossilised eye of @entity45 bridgei using an electron microscope			2
' b ' shows the creature 's well - preserved eyes and gills , while ' c ' shows a close - up of one of its eyes , including the pigment cells , which are the earliest proof of an animal seeing in colour @entity61 fish are sometimes called spiny sharks , but are a class of extinct fish , which share features with bony fish			1
they may resemble sharks , but their epidermis was covered with tiny platelets , like the scales of gars			0
their name was coined because they were superficially shark - shaped , with a streamlined body , paired fins and an upturned tail , snout and bony spines			0
they had a cartilage skeleton but their fins were bony			0
the earliest acanthodians were marine , but during the @entity87 period , freshwater species became more common			2
@entity88 were filter feeders , with no teeth in their jaws , but could see in colour			0
‘ these are both in the retina of a modern human and animal eye to enable colour vision			1
' cones are structures in the eye that are designed to absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit them to the brain			2
most people have three types of cones , which are tuned to wavelengths of red , green and blue			0
rods are responsible for vision at low light levels			0
professor @entity20 added : ‘ we can now use these techniques to examine colour pigments in other ancient animals , bringing us closer to the time when colour vision first evolved			1
’ scientists from the museum in @entity122 and @entity123 in the @entity124 of @entity125 , scanned the tissues in the fossilised eye of @entity128 using an electron microscope			1
further chemical analysis on the fossil showed evidence of cone cells and rods in the retina , according to the study , which was published in @entity137			0
parts of the visual system are not usually preserved in the fossil record because the soft tissue of the eye and brain decay rapidly after death , making the discovery particularly rare			2
@entity146 were filter feeders , with no teeth in the jaw			0
many paleonthologists consider that the acanthodians were close to the ancestors of bony fishes			0
although their interior skeletons were made of cartilage , a bonelike material developed in the skins of these fish , in the form of closely fitting scales .			0

@entity163 eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision
scientists from the @entity22 , @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity125 , identified rods and cones in the fossil
discovery proves colour vision existed a long before the @entity33 period
find could help scientists pinpoint when colour vision first evolved
