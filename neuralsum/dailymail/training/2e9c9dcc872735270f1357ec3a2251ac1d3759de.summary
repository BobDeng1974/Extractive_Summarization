@entity0 trudged back to the @entity2 pavilion the other evening with his mind in turmoil and his face set in stone			1
dismissed for a pittance , one more anti-climax to add to a lengthening list			1
he tried to disguise his desperation , but his anxiety was all too evident			1
a game which had once come so easily to him was now posing intractable problems			1
he was acutely aware that around the ground , around the entire country , his professional future was being urgently discussed			1
and nowhere more than in the broadcasting boxes , high in the grandstand , where the ancients sat in judgment			1
a few were stern , most were sympathetic , but all had captained @entity24 and all were employed to express their opinions			1
and so we heard from sir @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
and we knew , beyond question , that before the day was done @entity0 would become sharply aware of their increasing disillusion with their hapless successor			1
as any of the people on that list could tell him , such is the lot of the captain of @entity24			1
downcast : @entity0 trudges off after his cheap first - innings dismissal now it is difficult to sympathise with a sublimely gifted athlete of 29 years , a man at the peak of his sporting powers			1
yet when we consider the immensity of @entity0 ’s problems , a measure of sympathy is irresistible			1
his batting is one thing ; while his current form may be bleak , a record of 25 test centuries and some 8,000 @entity57 runs at an average of 45 is evidence of exceptional pedigree			2
the good days will surely return ; it is merely a matter of time			1
but the captaincy is a different matter altogether ; not so much a job , more an office			1
the skipper of the @entity24 football team is not burdened by comparable responsibilities			1
the armband is lightly exchanged when a muscle tweaks or a substitution is effected ; seniority tends to be the main criterion , leadership skill a desirable extra			2
by comparison , the cricket captain is a man apart ; appointed by the game ’s elders and anointed by the @entity84			1
he is expected to possess professional excellence and social assurance , the tact of a diplomat and the patience of a saint			2
he should be an inspirational leader , a sagacious tactician , a father - confessor and an occasional whipping boy			2
and , above and beyond all that , he must score test centuries and win @entity57 series			2
of course , such expectations are thoroughly impertinent , given the shameful paucity of cricket in state schools and the diminishing public support for the county game			2
but excuses will not be accepted			2
and so @entity0 must cope with the twin pressures of his own currently uncertain form and the recurring crises of the side in his charge			1
he must attempt to forge something formidable from a team that have been too swiftly stripped of too many important players			2
in bad nick : @entity0 has not plundered a century since may of last year and he must endure the absurd distractions of @entity113 and his sycophantic retinue , as well as the irksome inanities of @entity116 , a man who continues to resent the fact that he was never entrusted with the test captaincy of @entity119			1
for a moment , just before the start of this series , @entity0 allowed himself a brief , exasperated protest at @entity116 ’s provocations , but by and large his self - control has been admirable			1
unlike his principal critics , the captain has never actively pursued celebrity			1
while his face is familiar , his voice is rarely heard in public and even then he tends to restrict himself to conventional , media - trained phrases : ‘ we ’re at the start of a cycle … great honour to lead the team … pride of wearing the three @entity138			2
’ he sees every phrase as a hostage to fortune			2
and yet there is an appealing decency about the man			2
his private life is properly protected , he never feels the need to seek out a cheap headline and — most important by far — his players are clearly eager to perform for him			2
following a skipper as distinguished as @entity35 was never going to be easy , but those close to the scene detect signs that @entity0 is growing into the job			1
public patience will be required , especially at a time when it is challenged by adverse events			1
and @entity0 ’s own patience must not fray , even though @entity116 , having found a populist theme , is unlikely to keep quiet , while @entity113 will publicly prattle whenever his chums remember to jerk his strings			1
yet the sense is that he will come through , that there really is something in the cliché which dictates that form is temporary but class is permanent			2
uncertain start : @entity171 ' second era began with a first home test defeat to @entity173 one big innings may be all that it takes ; one long , fluent , utterly productive performance , which sees the head still , the feet moving instinctively and the ball flying off the middle of the bat			0
and the hope must be that the day will soon arrive			0
for our finest sportsmen are awarded lavish measures of fame , wealth and public adulation			0
but from time to time , there is a price to be paid in return			1
@entity0 was paying that price at @entity2			1
and his suffering offered one of the most poignant images of an @entity196 summer			0
in a tone normally reserved for @entity200 funerals , the television reporter announced : ‘ tonight , @entity201 is a nation in mourning ’			0
and what savage catastrophe had prompted that assertion ? the national team had lost a football match			0
true , they had been rather heavily beaten in undignified circumstances and a measure of indignation was in order			0
but ‘ mourning ’ — defined as the expression of sorrow for somebody ’s death — was a grotesque exaggeration			0
we have all done it , of course			0
we have all described a missed penalty as a tragedy or an own goal as a disaster , so that when we are visited by real tragedy , real disaster , we have no adequate vocabulary			0
the torrents of tears , the synthetic hysteria , the ludicrous ‘ @entity232 ’ inquests ; they are all evidence of our failure to separate the make - believe of sport from the reality of everyday existence			0
on their knees : @entity240 and @entity241 were disconsolate following a crushing defeat to @entity243 and yet , the sporting week held an even more preposterous piece of hyperbole			0
a few days ago , there were some distressing spills in the @entity249			1
one poor chap went over his handlebars , another finished up in a ditch , while @entity254 , last year ’s champion , was forced to withdraw after a couple of damaging crashes			0
the @entity257 – @entity259 team manager , one @entity258 , described it as ‘ absolute war ’			0
this , of a stage which set off from the town of @entity264			0
@entity265 has failed in an appeal against his four – month ban from football			0
the appeal was supported by the @entity271 , who argued that his conviction was unsafe due to ‘ lack of evidence ’			0
it was a bold ploy , which might easily have succeeded but for the teeth - shaped scars on the shoulder of @entity280 , along with the eye – witness evidence of 39,706 people in the stadium as well as millions of television viewers across the planet			0
@entity265 ( above , after joining @entity287 ) is said to be preparing a new appeal			0
he is claiming mistaken identity			0
@entity290 : @entity265 joined @entity287 with a trademark grin the great ones , the best who ever played the game , tend to own a @entity297 winner ’s medal			0
@entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 ; it is an illustrious list			0
now @entity243 ’s improvement in this tournament has been genuinely dramatic , and their destruction of @entity201 was a performance for the ages			0
they would be worthy world champions			0
yet when we look again at that list , there is one name which demands admission			0
i dearly hope to see @entity317 joining the pantheon at the @entity319			0
cometh the hour : will @entity317 join the immortals as @entity321 chase a third @entity297 win			0

@entity0 *'s* future as @entity24 captain is in *jeopardy*
many former @entity24 captains are questioning his future
the good days will surely return ; it is merely a matter of time
but the captaincy is a different matter altogether ; not so much a job , more an office
