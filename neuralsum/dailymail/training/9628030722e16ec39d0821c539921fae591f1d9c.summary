by @entity0 published : 14:01 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 29 july 2013 secretary of state @entity1 has named former @entity3 ambassador to @entity5 @entity4 as the lead negotiator in the @entity5 - @entity8 peace talks that start tonight			1
mr @entity4 's role was announced at the @entity10 in @entity11 today , just hours before negotiators restart talks for the first time since 2010			1
the new @entity16 envoy said he looked forward to working with both sides to achieve ' president @entity19 's vision of two states , living side by side in peace and security '			1
the agreement to meet in @entity11 tonight for a working dinner follows diligent shuttle diplomacy by mr @entity1 in which he has travelled to the region six times in the past five months			1
mr @entity4 thanked president @entity19 and mr @entity1 for entrusting him with ' taking this breakthrough and turning it into a full - fledged @entity5 - @entity8 peace agreement			1
' ' it is a daunting and humbling challenge , but one that i can not desist from , ' he said			0
negotiations have been stalled since the controversy over @entity5 approving the settlement - building of 1,300 @entity52 settler homes in predominately @entity54 @entity53 in september 2010			2
they are considered illegal under international law , although the @entity5 dispute this			0
shuttle diplomacy : @entity1 meeting @entity8 president @entity36 , right , in the @entity60 city of @entity61 in july @entity63 issues : president @entity19 on a visit to @entity5 in march , talking to president @entity66 , right , and prime minister @entity35 , left the two sides confirmed they would meet hours after @entity5 approved the release of 104 @entity8 prisoners who had been held for up to thirty years - a long - standing demand of president @entity36			1
' i think reasonable compromises have to be a keystone of all of this effort , ' mr @entity1 told reporters as he acknowledged that the path ahead would be long and difficult			2
the initial negotiations starting today , mostly over procedure , are expected to continue on tuesday			0
the @entity5 delegation will be led by justice minister @entity82 , while chief negotiator @entity83 will represent the @entity8 side			0
' i know the negotiations are going to be tough , but i also know that the consequences of not trying could be worse , ' mr @entity1 said			2
major sticking points will include the future of @entity5 settlements on the @entity60 , the status of @entity53 and the fate of @entity8 refugees			0
secret terms : the framework for the talks that @entity1 has managed to pull together between the @entity8 led by @entity83 , left , and the @entity5 led by @entity82 , right , have not been made public mr @entity1 explained that he chose mr @entity4 because he ' knows what has worked and he knows what has n't worked , and he knows how important it is to get this right '			1
' he understands that to ensure that lives are not needlessly lost , we have to ensure that opportunities are not needlessly lost			0
' in his new job , @entity102 replaces @entity104 , who had served as a place holder in the post until last month			0
@entity107 - born @entity4 , 62 , currently works as foreign policy director at @entity11 - based think tank , the @entity109			1
a former kibbutz volunteer and researcher at the @entity113 lobbying group @entity112 , he went on to serve as president @entity115 's ambassador to @entity5 from 1995 to 1997			2
@entity4 was a significant player in the failed 2000 @entity117 talks and he worked with @entity5 prime ministers @entity118 and @entity119 on @entity121 peace process in 1993			1
his new role follows a series of frustrations			0
@entity125 resigned from the post in 2011 following fruitless attempts to get the @entity5 and @entity8 to engage			0
thus far president @entity36 has been reluctant to negotiate with hard - line @entity5 leader mr @entity35 , fearing he will reject what the @entity8 consider minimal territorial demands			1
the @entity8 will be heading into the talks seeking a secure state of their own in the @entity60 , @entity134 and east @entity53 , territories @entity5 captured in 1967			0
however , the @entity8 have need to accept the principle of limited land swaps , allowing @entity5 to annex some of the dozens of settlements it has built on war - won lands since 1967			0
president @entity36 had repeatedly said he will only go to talks if @entity5 either freezes settlement building or recognises the 1967 lines as a starting point for drawing the border of a @entity8 state			2
late last year , the @entity148 recognised the @entity8 within those 1967 borders			0
@entity5 has made no such concessions , at least publicly , and the details of the framework for the talks brokered by mr @entity1 remain undisclosed .			1

@entity16 peace talks resume tonight for the first time in three years
@entity1 appointed former envoy to @entity5 @entity4 to lead talks
mr @entity4 say he will strive for president @entity19 's ' vision of two states '
the president says @entity11 - based talks will be a ' promising step '
