@entity1 's interest in @entity2 looks to have been dealt a killer blow , after @entity5 ceo @entity4 claimed the controversial striker would be staying with the @entity8 club			1
the former @entity10 centre forward has been consistently linked with a move to @entity13 's side , and @entity5 president @entity14 was even quoted earlier this summer as saying : ' i was selling @entity2 to an @entity17 team for several millions			1
' however , @entity4 now appears to have shot down any chance of a move to @entity20 with the 23 - year - old part of the club 's plans for the new season			2
' there ’s a 99.9 % chance of him staying , but you never know what will happen			0
' however , not all is lost for the @entity39 : @entity5 's ceo has already made similar comments in may about @entity43 midfielder @entity42 , saying : ' it ’s certain we ’ll keep him			1
i am 99.9 % he ’ll stay with us			0
' @entity42 subsequently moved to @entity47 , via a loan move to @entity49			2
but with @entity13 now being quoted as saying he is happy with his options up front it appears a move for @entity2 is off for this summer at least			0
him again : former @entity10 star @entity2 ( left ) has been linked with a move to @entity1			0

former @entity10 striker has been *constantly* linked with @entity39
@entity5 *admitted* striker was close to moving to an @entity17 club this summer
but now @entity4 claims he will remain in @entity5 with the @entity5
but he used the ' 99.9 per cent ' figure when claiming @entity42 would stay
@entity43 *playmaker* ended up *swapping* @entity30 for @entity47 via @entity49
