' of course there would be a currency union , ' the minister told the paper			2
' you simply can not imagine @entity35 abandoning the people of @entity5			0
' saying no to a currency union is obviously a vital part of the no campaign			2
but everything would change in the negotiations if there were a @entity44 vote			0
' the source also suggested a deal could be struck allowing the @entity7 to retain their nuclear weapons base at @entity49 in exchange for allowing @entity5 to retain the pound			1
he added : ' there would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a ' yes ' vote , with many moving pieces			0
' the @entity7 wants to keep @entity59 nuclear weapons at @entity49 and the @entity5 government wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal			1
' @entity5 leader @entity65 has repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from @entity49 on the @entity66 if @entity5 back independence			1
should @entity5 be allowed to stay in a currency union with @entity7 if it splits ? however mr @entity0 insisted : ' there will not be a currency union in the event of independence			1
the only way to keep the @entity7 pound is to stay in the @entity7			0
walking out of the @entity7 means walking out of the @entity7 pound			0

' the @entity7 would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks			0

' any suggestion to the contrary is wrong			0
' pledge : @entity5 leader @entity65 has repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from their @entity49 base on the @entity66 if @entity5 back independence polls show the question of what currency an independent @entity5 would use has been high in @entity5 voters ' minds ahead of an independence referendum on sept. 18			1
many north of the border worry about the economic uncertainties a new currency would bring if they voted to end the 300 - year - old union with @entity111			0
@entity5 secretary @entity112 said : ' an anonymous , off the record quote does not change the stark reality on the currency			2
' the @entity116 has listened to the views of the governor of the @entity19 and the independent advice of the permanent secretary to the treasury that a currency would be damaging for all the @entity7			2
@entity5 's deputy first minister @entity122 said the minister 's comments gave a big boost to the @entity44 campaign ' that 's why a currency union simply will not happen			1
' the @entity84 should remove the uncertainty on the currency by coming forward with a plan @entity132 ' the minister 's comments were seized on by deputy first minister @entity122 , who said they gave a big boost to the @entity44 campaign			0
she said : ' this was supposed to be the no campaign 's trump card , but as the polls show it has backfired badly - the gap between @entity44 has halved since november , and most @entity5 simply do not believe the bluff and bluster we had from @entity0 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
' now that the card has been withdrawn , it gives an even bigger boost to the @entity44 campaign			0
and it can only add to the sense of crisis which is engulfing the no campaign			0
' the reality is that a currency union is every bit as much in the interests of the rest of the @entity7 as an independent @entity5 , and that is why @entity35 will agree to one			1
' @entity5 is the rest of the @entity7 's second biggest trading partner , and not sharing sterling would cost businesses south of the border an extra Â £ 500 million in transaction costs			1
' she added : ' the leader of the no campaign , @entity168 , said that a shared sterling area between an independent @entity5 and the rest of the @entity7 is ' desirable ' and ' logical ' - and now the @entity116 appears to have u-turned and actually agrees with that sensible position			2
' the @entity84 's @entity172 on independence , published last november , says a shared currency is in the ' economic interests ' of @entity5 and the rest of the @entity7			2
almost half of voters north of the border think that mr @entity0 's pledge to rule out a formal currency union with an independent @entity5 is a bluff , according to a poll published this week			1
a @entity185 poll for the @entity187 newspaper suggests 45 per cent of @entity5 do not believe the chancellor 's threat is real , compared with 40 % who think he means what he says .			2
