and the former dragon says he is still struck by some of the more outlandish inventions pitched to him on the show			0
' i remember a couple who came on the show because they felt married couples do n't get a good night 's sleep because the woman moves over to the husband or vice versa			0
' they felt the way to solve that issue was to invent a white sheet with a black line down the middle			0
' i thought , why do n't you just use a ruler ? ' it 's a good reminder of some of the crazy ideas you get in the den.
