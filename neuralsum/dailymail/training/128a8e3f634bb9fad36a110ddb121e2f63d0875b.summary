there will be no @entity2 heroics from @entity3 this year after the @entity4 no 3 slumped to a first - round loss in qualifying at @entity6			1
the @entity8 player had a match point in the second set against @entity11 but could not take it and was eventually beaten 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 11/9 ) 6 - 2			1
twelve months ago the mercurial @entity3 made his major breakthrough by qualifying in @entity13 and going on to reach the third round			2
game over : @entity3 fell at the first hurdle and failed to progress in @entity2 qualifying his final match was a thrilling encounter against @entity20 - who went on to beat @entity21 - that he could and probably should have taken into a fifth set			1
@entity3 has not kicked on as he or those within @entity4 tennis would have hoped , the 24 - year - old admittedly not helped by a niggling knee injury			0
@entity27 , the 16th seed and world no 132 , was a tough first - round draw but @entity3 battled hard to win the first set and , having let a golden chance to break go by at the start of the second , he dug in admirably			2
but he was edged out in the tie - break , @entity11 saving @entity3 ' match point with an ace and then taking advantage of two poor points from the @entity4 player to end the set			1
it was @entity11 who had the momentum going into the decider and @entity3 never managed to wrestle it back			0
long 12 months : @entity3 reached the third round of the @entity2 last year in his major breakthrough the defeat will see @entity3 ' ranking plummet from its current 176 well into the 200s and he must try to find something like his form of last summer to prevent it dropping further			0
there was @entity4 success from @entity56 , who comfortably saw off unheralded @entity58 @entity57 6 - 2 6 - 2 to set up a second - round qualifying clash with @entity61 's @entity60			1
@entity56 is at a career - high ranking of 131 after an excellent run on the @entity65 hard courts and will have high hopes of making the main draw in @entity13 for the first time			0
the 27 - year - old was the only one of five @entity4 players to survive the first round , with @entity72 joining @entity3 in exiting the tournament on wednesday			0
@entity74 needs to step up - @entity75			0
