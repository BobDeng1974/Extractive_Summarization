campaign : @entity2 's conservatives want the @entity4 language used more regularly in @entity6 institutions and treated on a par with @entity8 and @entity9 @entity2 's party wants the @entity4 language used more regularly in @entity6 institutions and treated on a par with @entity8 and @entity9			1
the @entity4 chancellor 's @entity10 want to increase the use of @entity4 in @entity6 if they are re-elected when the country goes to the polls in september			1
it is not the first time @entity2 's conservatives have called for a strengthening of @entity4 in @entity20 however , given @entity4 's growing economic power within @entity6 since the outbreak of the eurozone debt crisis just over three years ago , the demand is likely to annoy other countries			1
' @entity4 is the most frequently spoken native language and one of three working languages of the @entity34 , ' a draft programme from @entity2 's @entity10 ( @entity29 ) and its @entity31 sister party , the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , reads			1
' we will push for a further strengthening of the @entity4 language in @entity6			0
our goal is that it is treated in the same way as @entity8 and @entity9 in the @entity40 , the ( @entity6 ) @entity41 and ( @entity6 ) council			0
' @entity8 and @entity9 have been the dominant working languages of the @entity34 in the past few decades , although @entity9 has declined since 2004 as the bloc expanded from 15 to 27 members , most from eastern @entity6 where @entity8 is a more common second language			0
but there are differences depending on the institution			0
@entity4 is rarely used day - to - day at the @entity41 , but is heard frequently at the @entity40 , which has a @entity4 president and is made up of more @entity4 than members from any other state because of the country 's large population			2
@entity55 , leader of @entity2 's conservatives in parliament , caused a storm back in 2011 , when at the height of the crisis he boasted that ' @entity6 speaks @entity4 '			1
in their election programme , the @entity29 and @entity27 also hail the imposition of ' @entity4 - style debt brakes ' across @entity6 and @entity66 's role in firming up @entity34 budget rules and ensuring that structural economic reforms are being implemented in its euro partners			2
frustration : it is not the first time @entity2 's conservatives have called for a strengthening of @entity4 in @entity20			1
but given @entity4 's growing economic power within @entity6 the demand is likely to annoy other countries they also trumpet their opposition to common euro zone bond issuance and a @entity6 - wide deposit guarantee scheme			2
' this would mutualise risks , forcing @entity4 savers to guarantee the deposits of other countries , ' the draft programme , which is due to be approved this weekend , reads			0
the parties hold up @entity4 's balanced economy and robust industrial base as a ' worldwide model '			2
' these successes are bringing us global recognition			0
a survey by the @entity97 broadcaster @entity98 shows that @entity4 is the most liked country in the world			0

@entity2 's @entity10 issued plea
it comes *ahead* of @entity4 elections in september
