by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:01 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:01 est , 21 december 2013 the @entity4 sisters may yet face civil action from @entity6 as he tries to recover the £ 685,000 he claims they were not authorised to spend on his credit card			1
but @entity8 and @entity4 are considering their own legal action according to their family – they plan to sue @entity11 and mr @entity6 for defamation and damage to their reputation , following their acquittal at @entity17			1
their father , @entity19 , told @entity20 that his family was furious at the way the sisters ’ names had been tarnished by their former employers			2
@entity4 and @entity25 arriving at @entity17 during the case earlier this month speaking from his home in southern @entity29 , he said : ‘ we are now going to see if we can sue them for damages for what they put @entity8 and @entity4 through			2
the girls have been brought up well , have never done anything wrong and were innocent			0
@entity19 says that his family is furious at the way that his daughters names have been tarnished by the case ‘ the lawyers were right when they said they were just lambs caught in the middle of a fight between two wolves			0
’ he said the case had been ‘ really tough ’ on both his daughters and accused mr @entity6 and @entity49 of making his children scapegoats in their marital battle			0
he said : ‘ i ’d love to have five minutes with them so i can make them see sense			0
they used my own daughters for their own personal battles			0
as for @entity11 and @entity6 , all i will say is that one is just a filthy drug user and the other is a cruel b * * * * * d. ’ despite being cleared of all criminal charges , the two former personal assistants could still be sued by mr @entity6 should he decide to pursue a civil lawsuit to reclaim the ‘ misappropriated funds ’			1
an outstanding civil claim , submitted in july last year , demands that the pair pay back the money spent on taxis and personal items , as well as return the goods bought using mr @entity6 ’s credit card			1
should mr @entity6 decide to pursue the case , the public could see the whole saga played out @entity79 ’s lawyers could not be reached for comment			2
@entity6 arriving at @entity17 during the case			0
it is thought that he could still sue the @entity4 sisters to recover the money spent on his credit card			1

father of @entity4 sisters says that they may sue for damages after acquittal
@entity6 may still *launch* civil action to recover credit card money
father brands @entity79 a ' cruel b * * * * * d ' and says his family is furious
