never tell a sex joke to a @entity1 , and do n't even dare use toilet humour in @entity3			1
they 're two crucial rules any stand - up must follow - if they believe a new study on the ever - elusive @entity9 sense of humour			1
the report interviewed more than 2,000 comedy fans across @entity9 and claimed @entity13 and the @entity14 were the only people who liked toilet humour overall , while those in the @entity17 were the biggest fans of sex jokes			1
it scored minus 5 on a scale from 100 to minus 100 , while the @entity17 registered a score of 33			2
some topics , including disability , race and death , were off - limits for almost everyone			1
others were fair game , including family , politics , the economy , education , gender and health			0
@entity64 said : ' it 's great to see the surge in female comedians , stamping out the prejudice ' most comedy fans enjoyed a gentle ribbing about where they live but those in the @entity17 and @entity73 were particular fans , with those in the @entity76 less impressed			1
toilet humour was deemed unacceptable everywhere except @entity78 and @entity14 - and @entity3 thought scatological jokes were particularly unfunny			1
despite the regional differences the @entity81 : comedy report , commissioned by the gig sales website @entity85 , found there was no clear north - south divide to what @entity9 enjoy in comedy			1
the wide - ranging survey also found big - name female comics such as @entity31 and @entity38 are putting women on the map - and into the box office			1
shows by female comedians now account for 14 per cent of all comedy tickets sold			0
despite comprising less than a seventh of all sales , the figure is a big improvement on 2009 when women were producing just 2 per cent of the industry 's takings			2
comedian @entity64 said : ' it 's great to see the surge in female comedians , stamping out the prejudice			0
' we have still further to go though , i 'd like to see more female comics enjoying the dominance that men do on the bigger stages			0
' perhaps we are not capturing the public 's imagination in the same way , but it is all changing for the better and we are well on the way to enjoying equal success with our comedy brothers			0
' the nation 's favourite comedians were still dominated by men including @entity36 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
@entity38 was the only woman to make the top ten , squeezing into tenth place , but she came fifth in a list of comedians most likely to ' unite families ' on the sofa			0
the poll of more than 2,000 people revealed the extent to which tv can make or break a comedian 's career , as 51 per cent of the respondents - who watched live shows regularly - said they would only pay to see someone who had already appeared on - screen			0
top pick : @entity125 regularly crops up in the nation 's list of favourite comics , and this was no exception @entity9 's regions may have differences in what people find funny but comedians are drawn from every corner of the country			2
pictured : @entity159 - born @entity126 ( left ) and @entity160 's @entity127 ( right ) made the top five and it claimed the art of heckling is disappearing , with only one in five thinking it was acceptable and just 3 per cent admitted to doing it regularly			0
but as any comedy - lover worth their salt will insist , few gig - goers are perfect			2
even though more than four - fifths of people said whispering during a set was unacceptable , almost the same number admitted to doing it themselves .			2

survey for gig sales outlet @entity85 examined ' unacceptable ' jokes
topics like disability , race and death off - limits but others up for *debate*
