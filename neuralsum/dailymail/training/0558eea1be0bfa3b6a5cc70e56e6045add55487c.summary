there was a moment , less than a minute into @entity2 's appearance after @entity4 's victory over @entity5 , when the threat was real and the mood was menacing			1
' one more question i leave , so i 'm more concerned with my reaction , so one more question and i will have to go , ' claimed @entity4 's manager			1
@entity2 was back in ' @entity13 ' , driving the @entity4 battle bus towards another ridge in the road			1
he left us with another cliffhanger			0
because this is @entity4 , because this is @entity2 , the repercussions and the recriminations will last for days			1
in real - time @entity2 jumped out of his seat , followed wearily and predictably by the concertinaed figures of coaches @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity54 was waving an imaginary card at referee @entity56 , for which he was booked , and @entity4 's bench were demanding the return of capital punishment down there			1
scenes like that make you want to cough up blood			0
what followed was the ugly side of the game , with players from @entity4 and @entity5 puffing out their chests and pretending they are all hard as nails			1
for the @entity73 the focus on thursday morning will be on @entity30 , the @entity4 defender who was accused on social media of biting @entity5 substitute @entity32			1
@entity2 cut his usual animated figure on the touchline as he watched his league leaders win again the resulting free - kick led to the decisive goal and @entity30 was involved			1
his header was punched out unconvincingly by @entity82 to @entity40 , who struck the winner			1
@entity30 is likely to be charged with violent conduct for shoving his head into the side of @entity32 's left ear before @entity4 's captain @entity88 and @entity89 could eventually drag the doofus away			1
lovely player and all that , but even the great players lose it from time to time			0
and when @entity2 was asked about the apparent headbutt , he threatened to walk out			2
the @entity96 , last month fined Â£ 25,000 for saying there was a ' clear campaign ' against @entity4 , was not prepared to discuss the possibility the @entity101 defender could be banned			1
he had earlier told @entity102 : ' did @entity30 go in with his head ? do n't make me laugh			2
do n't make me laugh			0
' @entity2 delivers a withering look as he stood firm on not answering questions about @entity30 and in an interview with the @entity107 , when asked if he would punish a player if replays showed he had committed an offence , the @entity96 ended the interview , saying : ' sorry			1
' @entity5 boss @entity114 felt the @entity101 should have been dismissed			2
the @entity115 said : ' @entity30 's behaviour is wrong			1
' he grabs @entity32 around his neck in a very forceful manner , then he puts his head against him when @entity32 never reacted one single bit			2
' if you want to be on top of the laws that 's a red card			2
' @entity2 has already shown his displeasure at @entity126 being suspended retrospectively for three matches for stamping on @entity129 's @entity128			1
the @entity131 boss , who could be fined by the @entity132 for opting out of media duties surrounding last month 's draw with @entity135 , continues to imply his side are unfairly treated			2
willian fires home @entity4 's winning goal as @entity5 's resistance is finally broken @entity82 is left stranded as @entity40 's shot flies past him to earn @entity4 all three points @entity40 heads to the corner flag to celebrate and is soon joined by his @entity4 team - mates two decisions went in favour of @entity5 in the opening quarter of the contest , when the ball hit @entity150 's arm in the penalty area in the fourth minute and when @entity43 made two fouls in quick succession , but was booked only for the first offence			1
@entity2 added : ' i 'm tired of stories and i 'm never tired of football			2
@entity158 is emotion and what we had here			0
' a discussion because of a red card , a red card that should be given in the first half , because @entity43 should be sent off in the first half			0
the second yellow card should be given there			0
' @entity2 had no complaints with referee @entity56 ' performance			2
' i think it 's a clear penalty			2
i also think the referee had a fantastic performance , ' the @entity131 boss added			0
' the official that disallowed the goal , it was a fantastic decision			0
' @entity2 felt @entity43 should have been shown a second yellow card for pulling @entity185 's shirt @entity43 was eventually sent off in the second half for his part in the melee reporter : the mass confrontation between the players at the end ... @entity2 : you know , i 'm tired of stories			1
i 'm never tired of football and football is emotion and football is what we had here today			0
a discussion because of a red card that should be given in the first half because [ @entity43 ] @entity43 should be sent off in the first half because he had a yellow card			0
he pulled @entity185 when @entity185 goes to attack a defender so second yellow card should be shown there			0
so nothing , nothing important			0
reporter : how concerned are you that @entity30 might face retrospective action ? @entity2 : i 'm concerned about my reaction because one more question i leave and after that you 're not happy			1
i 'm more concerned with my reaction because the next question for that story , i have to go			0
reporter : do you think you should have had a penalty ? @entity2 : i think it is a clear penalty but i think the referee had a fantastic performance			2
[ it is ] a very difficult performance when the game is one team defending , recovering the ball and playing it to [ @entity230 ] @entity229			0
this for a referee must be a nightmare			0
he has to be focused on one box then suddenly a long ball and the ball is faster than the referee			0
so i think [ it was a ] very difficult match for him but very stable performance			0
and the official that disallowed the goal was a fantastic decision .			0
