dr @entity241 introduced the concept of intermittent fasting two years ago also known as intermittent fasting , the 5:2 diet was introduced by dr @entity245 in 2013			0
he says : ' one of the main things that intermittent fasting seems to do is switch on repair genes — genes whose job it is to keep the various bits of your body in good shape			0
' the reason this happens is not fully understood ; however , the evolutionary argument goes something like this			0
as long as we have plenty of food , our bodies remain in constant ‘ go - go ’ mode ; it is like driving a car with your foot constantly on the accelerator			2
when you fast , the body ’s initial reaction is one of shock			0
signals go to the brain reminding you that you are hungry , urging you to find something to eat			0
the body decides there must be a famine , so there is little point wasting energy on growth : instead , it gets cracking on some of the urgent maintenance tasks that it might have been putting off			0
as part of this repair process , the body breaks down and recycles old and tired cells ( in a process called autophagy or ‘ self eat ’ ) getting rid of damaged or ageing parts to keep everything else in good working order			0
@entity301 , it seems , also sparks the production of new cells			0
recently , professor @entity304 of the @entity305 published a study showing , for the first time , that fasting can switch on stem cells and regenerate the immune system			0
this has significance in the fight against cancer			0
being able to create new white cells and build a more powerful immune system not only keeps infections at bay but also means mutating cells that might turn into a cancer are destroyed by the immune system long before they can multiply			0
there were initial concerns among the scientific community that fasting could harm the immune system , because when you starve , your system tries to save energy by recycling damaged immune cells			0
in the long run , this would be harmful , making you more vulnerable to infections			0
but professor @entity304 discovered that if you fast for a very short period , and then eat , you get a re-bound effect , with the creation of new , more active cells			0
‘ we could not have predicted that fasting would have such a remarkable effect , ’ he says			0
i am now convinced that intermittent fasting could have a game - changing effect on the nation ’s health			2
