by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 11 september 2013 they may both be a grandmother of the future @entity3 , but it seems that @entity5 and @entity6 do n't share the public 's vote when it comes to style			1
@entity12 's mother @entity11 has pipped @entity6 to the top spot when it comes to @entity15 of the ' @entity16 '			0
a new survey has revealed that 40 per cent of grandmother 's vote @entity11 , 58 , as their poster girl , with just 2 per cent opting for 66 - year - old @entity6			0
the survey also revealed that 88 per cent of @entity28 grandmother ’s now consider themselves to be ‘ glam - mas ’ , and are a serious force to be reckoned with in the style stakes			2
with the average age of a @entity28 grandparent now under 50 , researchers have discovered that grandmothers are now choosing to step away from their traditional stereotype and as a result have become somewhat of a style inspiration for many of their younger family members			1
of those surveyed , an incredible 92 per cent stated that they actively followed the latest fashions , with classic and smart trends proving to be the most popular			2
it 's a style - off ! @entity11 was voted the poster girl of the grandmother 's with 40 per cent of the votes , whilst @entity6 received 2 per cent battle of the glam - mas : @entity11 , 58 , may be younger than @entity6 , 66 , but both exude their own sense of style big spenders : glam - mas spend up to £ 100 a month to keep their wardrobes as stylish as their style icons similarly , it appears that grandmothers today are on the pulse when it comes to what styles to avoid , with dresses above the knee and tight fitting pieces topping the poll as the biggest fashion faux pas			1
this new breed of ‘ @entity75 ’ is also determined to keep their wardrobes up to date , with 44 per cent of those asked admitting to spending up to £ 100 each month on new purchases			2
@entity78 – 40 per @entity79 – 28 per @entity80 – 10 per @entity81 – 10 per @entity82 – 7 per @entity83 – 3 per @entity84 – 2 per cent and it ’s not just the seniors who rank themselves highly in the style stakes , as over 50 per cent of grandchildren surveyed also agree that their grandmother is a style muse – with the majority stating it is their grandmother ’s attitude towards her outfit choices that they admire the most			0
a spokesperson for @entity95 , who carried out the survey , said : ' i think it ’s fantastic to see from our survey results that so many grandmothers are enjoying fashion and feeling confident and comfortable enough to experiment with different styles and trends			0
' as we ’ve highlighted , the average age of a @entity28 grandparent is a lot younger than it used to be , so it is not surprising that the traditional view of what a grandma should look like has now become outdated			0
' a lot of these women will have spent many years working hard and raising their families so it ’s great that they can now find the time to focus on themselves and have some fun with fashion			0
' there are so many super stylish grandmas in the public eye at present such as @entity5 and @entity33 that are really leading the way for @entity28 women and providing them with a huge pool of style inspiration			1
