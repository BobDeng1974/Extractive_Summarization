a former high class escort - rated among the top one per cent in her field by @entity5 , ' the @entity0 of the commercial sex world ' - has detailed her carefully calculated strategies			1
@entity8 , as she refers to herself , moved to @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 , when she was 19 years old and had $ 300 to her name			1
lured by the promise of quick money , she entered the escort industry and soon made a small fortune by catering to investment bankers , 90per cent of them married			1
' mostly , i offered understanding , ' she wrote for @entity20			0
' the truth is , even for guys who hire me for three or four hours , the sex usually only takes about 15 minutes			0
' not bad for $ 1,000 an hour			2
around 98per cent of men wanted to perform oral sex on her , and 80per cent of them would ask if she 'd had an orgasm , or insist she had multiple orgasms before they did			2
this was n't about her pleasure , of course , it was their need to ' prove themselves			0
' @entity8 faked orgasms with relative ease and presumably on nearly every occasion			1
her mind , she says , was always in business mode			0
she refers to one instance in which a client asked to pour honey all over her before they had sex			0
she agreed - but only after he agreed to pay triple her hourly rate - and she spent the whole rampant session mulling over cleaning the sheets and re-doing her hair and make - up			1
with regards to her beauty regime , @entity8 cut no corners			1
she admits she ' did n't each much , ' employed a personal trainer and had manicures and pedicures - always red , ' any other color is taking a risk ' - at least twice a week			1
her mascara cost her $ 130 , her eye shadow , foundation and lipstick cost $ 50 a pop , regular hair appointments cost $ 200 , lingerie sets cost $ 600 , not to mention the clothes and shoes			1
one of @entity8 's biggest overheads were the ads she placed on @entity87 ; the ' best ' site for high - class escorts and ' $ 2,000 - an - hour porn stars , ' who pay a base fee of $ 400 a month to be listed			1
@entity8 , evidently a shrewd businesswoman , found that by representing herself , she did n't have to pay an agent the standard 30 - 40per cent of her fee			1
instead , she spent almost $ 4,000 a month buying up the most prominent spaces on @entity87 , and flooding the ' featured ' and ' what 's new ' spotlights with her profile			1
self - promotion : @entity8 , evidently a shrewd businesswoman , spent almost $ 4,000 a month buying up the most prominent spaces on @entity101 ( pictured ) to source clients she spent ' at least $ 3,000 ' on monthly rent for a @entity105 - based apartment in which to entertain clients , as the sorts of clients she was pulling in were hardly going to travel to cheaper areas like @entity108 or @entity109			1
initially , @entity8 did n't give much thought to how she presented herself in her ads , beyond commissioning expensive photo shoots so she looked her best			1
she quickly learned to up her game , however			0
' what i know now is that guys want to know the women they ’re f * * * * * g. it surprised me , but a lot of them - most of them - really need to feel a sort of connection , ' she writes			2
' i always wondered why @entity122 ran those little interviews with the girls alongside the photos			0
the guys who are j * * * * * g off want to feel like they know the girl			0
' when it came to her ethnicity , @entity8 was seemingly born lucky			1
' white girls ' charge the most in the business , followed by ' @entity136 girls , ' then ' @entity131 ' and then ' black girls			0
' ' men here - especially @entity140 men - have certain ideas about certain nationalities , ' she writes			2
' if you ’re a @entity144 , then you ’re wild , you ’re fun , and you love to f * * k. ' if you ’re @entity145 , you ’re bad ! you ’re freaky , and you ’ll do anything , and you ’ll want to do more ! ... @entity11 are hot , but also icy and mean ... @entity140 girls ... sometimes have cute ponytails and big smiles , but guys think they ’re sort of selfish and bitchy , too			0
' @entity8 built herself two personas to advertise to men ; @entity153 - was more ' shy ' and ' passionate , ' and @entity154 was ' fun and playful			1
' lucrative : high - class escorts like @entity156 ( left ) who allegedly served @entity157 , and @entity158 ( right ) command thousands of dollars per night @entity8 made herself available 12 hours a day , from noon until midnight , ' rarely ' drank , ' never ' took drugs , ' always ' used condoms and demanded payment in advance - although , she says , it 's best to pretend the envelope ' does n't exist			1
' she made it a rule never to ask men about their families , but remarks that it 's surprising how often they ' brag ' about their kids			0
most importantly of all , amid the hours and hours of chatter , she never opened up about her own problems			0
' a billionaire does n't understand what s * * * * y problems i have , ' she writes			0
' it ’s bad business			0
a guy will complain to you over and over , but he does n't want to hear your complaints			0
' @entity8 was highly tactful when it came to demanding the best			1
rather than appear spoiled in her requests to fly first class while travelling with clients , she would weave silky allusions into the conversation			2
for example , she would claim that her ' really long legs ' would get cramped in coach , which would hinder her ' flexibility ' and thus affect her 'd * * * y - style ' performance			2
in addition to clients that - quite literally - came and went , @entity8 had a fair few long - term arrangements too			1
one 62 - year - old client , divorced and with cancer , would pay her a $ 20,000 - a - month retainer for two full days and nights every week			1
eventually , he proposed marriage , and promised a hefty inheritance from his will , but @entity8 declined			2
artistic license : former escort dr @entity202 ( left ) wrote a book about her experiences called @entity202 : diary of an @entity206 , which was made into a tv show starring @entity209 ( right ) @entity8 has never been raped , drugged or done porn			2
she claims she does n't ' hate men , ' has never had a pimp and does n't suffer from ' daddy issues ' or a difficult childhood			0
and perhaps in part to her dogged attention to detail and her carefully considered approach , she managed to avoid any dangerous or traumatic experiences			0
when she once caught a client attempting to videotape them having sex on the sly , she simply grabbed his phone , erased the footage , and told him to ' get the hell out ' of her apartment			0
another threatened to call the cops on her if she did n't give him free sex , so she threatened to post his phone number to a gay escort listing			0
young guys are ' bad , ' virgins are ' awful , ' and ' young virgins ' were a ' nightmare ' - but not because they were scary or dangerous , just woefully off - beat , @entity8 says			1
then there was the client who had sex with her for a full hour straight , all the while making ' woo woo woo ' train noises			2
aside from these mentions , life as a high - class escort appears to have suited @entity8			1
couples were her favorite sorts of clients , and she got to charge double the fee for the same amount - often less - of work			2
' that 's the cool thing about capitalism , ' she points out			0
eventually , @entity8 gave up her career and said goodbye to @entity153 and @entity154			2
she has saved up $ 200,000 over the past five years , and is currently studying film - making and psychology			1
she has had one boyfriend since she quit her former job , a banker ironically , but it did n't work out			0
and she has traded @entity101 in for sites like @entity261 and @entity262 , in the hopes of one day marrying and having children			0
@entity8 has no regrets about her life as an escort , and even misses certain aspects of it			2
but from now , she 's freshly minted and carving herself out a new - and very different - sort of @entity140 dream .			0

@entity8 , as she identifies herself , spent well over $ *7,000* a month on rent , clothes , beauty *products* and a personal trainer
she saved $ 200,000 over five years before quitting to pursue an education in film - making and psychology
ninety per cent of her clients were married
