by @entity0 fifty years since the @entity1 made their one and only visit to @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 were back in @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity1 ' iconic @entity10 album cover was recreated in front of @entity8 's @entity12 by waxwork models , over 10,553 miles from where the band originally posed in @entity16 , to celebrate their arrival @entity18			1
dressed in swinging sixties garb , the models were placed on a zebra crossing in @entity8 harbour - instead of outside @entity23			0
look who 's back : waxwork figures of the @entity1 posed in front of @entity8 's @entity27 and @entity12 on saturday iconic : the @entity1 ' @entity10 album cover , featuring the @entity1 walking across a zebra crossing outside @entity23 , is one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of music @entity10 , released in 1969 , was the eleventh studio album by the @entity1 and remains their best - selling record			1
the waxworks of the world 's favourite band have just arrived in @entity8 from @entity39 and will be part of an interactive exhibit at @entity42 in @entity43 , in the city centre			2
@entity42 first held sittings with @entity1 in 1964 - the same year that they toured @entity3			1
of course what was lacking when the waxworks touched down in @entity8 on saturday was the hysterical @entity48 that occurred when the real @entity50 lads arrived in @entity8 on 11 june 1964			2
long time : it has been 50 years since the band really visited @entity3 on their one and only tour @entity18 swinging sixties : @entity42 first held sittings with @entity1 in 1964 - the same year that they toured @entity3 the @entity1 began their @entity3 tour in @entity57 on 12 june 1964 , when 300,000 people lined the streets from the airport to the city to welcome them			1
@entity7 was hospitalised in the @entity62 when it kicked off so @entity64 was temporarily hired to stand in as a drummer until @entity7 rejoined the group in @entity67			0
by the time they were back in @entity8 on 18 june , it was @entity5 's 22nd birthday , and after the concert a party was held back at the @entity74			0
@entity10 now : tourists cross the zebra crossing made famous by the @entity1 beatlemania : on 12 june 1964 a huge crowd gathered outside the @entity79 in @entity80 , to welcome the @entity1 to @entity57 last week , one ardent fan , now 64 , revealed they still have a piece of cake from the musician 's 22nd birthday bash			0
the @entity1 were not only on their way to becoming the biggest rock band in 1964 , they were also the first ever to be featured at @entity42			0
for the new touring figures , @entity42 have used a combination of the sitting measurements and additional image research including a number of image references from the 1969 @entity10 photo shoot			0
biggest fans ? hundreds of screaming women met the @entity1 with banners and photos in @entity3 in 1964 the style of the figures is based on their styling around the time , not long before the band 's dissolution in 1970			2
' not only can guests interact with the famous four , but they can also recreate a moment of @entity1 history in their very own @entity10 album cover , ' @entity107 , general manager of @entity8 , said			1
