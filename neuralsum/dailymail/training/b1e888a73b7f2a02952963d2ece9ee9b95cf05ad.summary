by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent fortnightly rubbish collections are a threat to public health , @entity3 guidance warned yesterday			1
it said that no longer picking up bins from homes every week ‘ must surely increase the risk ’ to health			0
the warning to councils contradicts years of assurances from @entity15 that fortnightly collections have no effect on health and that infestations or smells that began after their introduction are the fault of householders who fail to observe the rules			2
collections : with the growth of recycling many councils switched to weekly rounds - now labelled unsafe mess : fortnightly collections were rubbished by the @entity31 instead , the guidelines from the @entity31 said that alongside the health risk , reports show ‘ householders suffering because of highly unpleasant odours coming from their rubbish , and maggots infesting their wheelie bins ’			1
the concerns were made public as part of an official appeal by the department and its secretary of state @entity44 for councils to return to the weekly collections of general rubbish that began to be abandoned a decade ago			1
@entity44 leads the department and has repeatedly lobbied for weekly collections between half and three quarters of the 350 local councils that operate rubbish collections now have compulsory recycling systems involving fortnightly collections of general ‘ residual ’ rubbish , or other restrictions on what families can put out for the binmen			1
mr @entity44 ’ document condemned the switch away from weekly collections in guidance that puts his department at odds with a rival @entity15 ministry , the @entity67 [ @entity67 ]			1
@entity67 has overall responsibility for waste collection			2
its ministers have promised to ‘ push ahead on all fronts ’ in order to meet @entity77 recycling targets and @entity67 papers say this includes demanding further ‘ behavioural changes ’ from householders			2
mr @entity44 said : ‘ this government is standing up for hard - working people and getting rid of barmy bin policies which made families ’ lives hell			1
‘ rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £ 120 - a - month council tax bill			2
people deserve a comprehensive weekly service in return for their taxes			0
if councils adopt this new guide as their bin bible , they will be able to save taxpayers ’ money and still increase the frequency and quality of rubbish and recycling collections			1
’ health concerns about fortnightly collections first arose in the mid- 2000s , amid complaints from householders and adverse reports from private pest control organisations			0
government - backed advice to councils said they should adopt fortnightly collections during the winter months , when people are less likely to notice the smell			0
the new @entity112 guidance said councils which move to fortnightly collections tell their residents there are no problems when the system is operated correctly			1
‘ while this “ evidence ” is not officially doubted here , a fortnightly collection is clearly a reduction in service from a weekly collection and must surely increase the risk , ’ it said			0
‘ there is no getting away from this fact			0
worry : health concerns were first raised over fortnightly collections in the mid- 2000s by pest controllers @entity129 : household waste and recycling can quickly pile up over @entity132 ( file photo ) ‘ one recent survey has found that problems with flies and smells were much worse with fortnightly collections			0
only this summer , reports from across the country have told how residents are unhappy with their fortnightly collection			0
’ it added that @entity144 recommendations say that in temperate climates like that of @entity148 , rubbish should be collected once a week , and that fortnightly collections have been blamed for a rise in numbers of rat infestations			0
the guidance denounced a series of ‘ myths ’ about fortnightly collections			0
it said claims they make life easier for residents are ‘ surprising ’ and @entity77 regulations do not demand the end of weekly collections or the introduction of five separate bins			2
last year mr @entity44 offered councils that keep or bring back weekly collections a share of £ 250million in incentive money from his ministry .			1

guidance was *issued* yesterday by department led by @entity44
he has pushed councils to make weekly bin collections with £ 250m grant
surprise *announcement* puts mr @entity44 on *collision* course with @entity67
