but @entity7 found herself in a rather awkward position after her father - in - law was called to help when she went into labour			2
@entity11 , 61 , was called to step in when she gave birth in the hallway of her home and had to use the laces from his son @entity16 's trainers to help deliver the child			1

after four contractions , the baby arrived and mr @entity11 used laces from @entity16 's trainers to tie the umbilical chord before cutting it			1
mrs @entity19 , 28 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' i woke up in the morning with a bit of tummy ache and felt a bit groggy but thought nothing of it as i had been experiencing that throughout my pregnancy			2
' my husband had gone to work so i was on my own			2
just after 11am i had a shooting pain in my tummy and thought it could be a contraction			0
i rang @entity16 and said " i think i am having the baby , you need to come home now " ' ' he said he would , but he works 25 miles away in @entity56 , and called my father - in - law , @entity11 , who lives about 10 minutes away to come and wait with me			1
' ' thankfully , my father - in - law arrived and told me to sit down as the baby was coming now			1
he told me i needed to do one more big push			0
' @entity61 ms @entity19 went upstairs to get dressed and had another contraction within two minutes			1

@entity76 was handed to her while @entity11 went upstairs to get a towel to wrap the newborn in to keep him warm			1
although mrs @entity19 and her father - in - law were thrown in at the deep end with the unexpected birth , he received step - by - step guidance on the phone from the ambulance service			2
' she told him he needed to tie the cord to stop the blood supply and cut it , ' said ms @entity19 ' my husband had some new trainers nearby so @entity89 used the laces to tie the cord before he cut it			1
i was so glad he was there			0
the whole birth happened in 15 minutes			2

' mr @entity11 , 61 , a full - time carer to his wife , said the birth experience last month pushed him out of his comfort zone			1

' i have never delivered a baby before but there was no time to think			2
