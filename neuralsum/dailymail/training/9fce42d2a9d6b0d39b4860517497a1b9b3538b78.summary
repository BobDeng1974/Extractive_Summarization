by @entity0 @entity1 - @entity1 - may be airbone , meaning it can spread easier the deadly @entity1 virus which has killed more than 300 people may be airborne , it has been claimed			1
@entity7 scientists drew the conclusion after finding gene fragments of the deadly @entity1 in air from a barn housing an infected camel			1
they say this suggests the disease may be transmitted through the air			1
this is concerning because viruses that spread through air - such as flu viruses - are far more likely to spread swiftly and widely in human populations than those that can only move from an animal to a person , or from person to person , via direct contact			1
@entity1 , a serious respiratory illness caused by a virus known as a coronavirus ( @entity30 ) , has infected at least 850 people since it first emerged two years ago			1
of these people , it has killed 32 , according to latest figures from the @entity34			0
the vast majority of human cases have been in @entity7 , but isolated @entity1 cases have been reported across @entity38 , @entity39 and the @entity40 in people linked who have recently travelled in the @entity1			2
scientists are not sure of the origin of the virus , but several studies have linked it to camels			0
some experts believe it is being passed to humans through close physical contact or through the consumption of camel meat or camel milk			0
however , the latest research suggests the detection of the virus in air samples was concerning and needed to be followed up , @entity56 reports			0
the study was published in the online journal of the @entity63 , @entity64			0
for the research , a team led by @entity66 , an associate professor of medical virology at @entity67 , collected three air samples on three consecutive days from a camel barn near @entity70			2
it was owned by a 43 - year - old male @entity1 patient who later died from the disease			2
four of the man 's nine camels had shown signs of nasal discharge the week before he became ill , and he had applied a topical medicine in the nose of one of the sick camels a week before experiencing symptoms			0
using a laboratory technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( @entity86 ) to detect levels of particular genes , the scientists found that the first air sample , collected on november 2013 , contained genetic fragments of the @entity1 virus			1
several studies have linked the origin of the virus to camels			0
the conclusions of the latest research were drawn after examining air samples of a camel barn belonging to a man who later died from @entity1 this was the same day that one of the patient 's camels tested positive for the disease , they explained in a report of their work			1
the other samples did not test positive for the @entity111 - suggesting short or intermittent shedding of the virus into the air surrounding the camels , professor @entity66 said			0
further tests of the first air sample confirmed the presence of @entity1 genetic sequences and showed the fragments were identical to those detected in the camel and its sick owner			1
he added : ' this study also underscores the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history with particular emphasis on any animal exposure for any @entity1 case - especially because recent reports suggest higher risk of ( @entity1 ) infections among people working with camels			2
' the @entity134 and the @entity135 have advised camel farm and slaughterhouse workers to take precautions against @entity1 by ensuring good hygiene , including frequent hand washing after touching animals , facial protection where feasible , and wearing of protective clothing .			0

conclusion came after analysing air in barn housing an infected camel
there , scientists found gene fragments of @entity1
they say this suggests disease may be transmitted through the air
of concern because airborne viruses more likely to spread swiftly and widely
@entity1 has already infected at least 850 people and killed *327* in two years
