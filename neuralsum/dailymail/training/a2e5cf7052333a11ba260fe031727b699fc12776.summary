by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has launched a ferocious critique of modern @entity6 footballers ahead of the new season , claiming they are ' overpaid ' in a ' too - much - too - young ' industry and lack the ' hunger ' and ' desire ' to resist the glut of foreign imports			1
@entity3 also admitted he feared @entity13 were doomed to fail at @entity14 with no quick exit from the mess in evidence at the @entity18 in @entity19 and blamed @entity20 for repeating the mistakes he made at @entity22			1
' we were hopeless , ' fumed the former @entity13 captain			1
' no - one can argue with that			2
no - one can say we were great , can they ? @entity20 ca n’t sit there and say we played some good football and we were unlucky			1
we were n’t good enough			2
' opinionated : @entity3 was far from happy with @entity13 's @entity18 performances in @entity19 @entity18 pundit : @entity3 was part of the @entity33 's punditry team in @entity19 along with the likes of @entity35 @entity3 , who scored 30 goals in 63 games for his country , delivered his gloomy forecast at a preview screening of the @entity33 documentary ' @entity41 at 50 ' which celebrates the flagship football show			1
' it is worrying , ' he said			2
' there ’s so many reasons , not one			2
there ’s too many foreign players and @entity6 players are not getting a chance , absolutely			2
they ’ re paid too much too young , not enough hunger , without a doubt , desire , being put on a pedestal too quickly			1
' put all those together and it ’s the reason why we put in another poor performance at a @entity18			1
can i see it changing ? i desperately hope so , but i do n’t see it changing in the near future			2
i see it changing in six - eight - 10 years			2
' i do n’t see it changing at the next tournament			0
i hope i ’m wrong			0
' @entity13 returned with only one point from three games in @entity19 , finishing bottom of a group won by @entity70 , but the performances of young players like @entity73 and @entity74 seemed to offer encouragement			1
' we keep on throwing young names forward every two or four years , to say : " these are the ones " but there ’s not many keep coming through , ' said @entity3			1
' i was one of the few who stuck with @entity20 after the tournament and said he should be in charge			1
public backing : @entity3 believes @entity20 is the right man for the job despite @entity13 's @entity18 failure too much , too soon : @entity3 believes @entity13 's young starlets are picking up huge wage cheques ' i still say that but , on the other hand , when you look at teams like @entity70 , you ca n’t say they had more ability than us but they were better organised and they got further in the tournament than us and there has to be a big question mark			1
' we made the same mistakes in this tournament we made in the last tournaments , two years ago and four years ago			0
two years ago we could n’t get hold of @entity105			0
this tournament we still could n’t get hold of @entity105			0
it does n’t take a genius to work that out , does it ? ' @entity3 , who admits he no longer has an appetite to be a manager , wants to see a return to a tougher apprenticeship but young @entity6 players are so prized by clubs that they can demand inflated transfer fees and wages			1
@entity118 revealed that @entity119 , 19 , wanted more than £ 100,000 a week to join @entity120 from @entity121 this summer			0
@entity74 has signed a new contract at the @entity123 since the @entity18 thought to be worth £ 65,000 - a - week			0
@entity124 are keen to offer @entity73 , also 19 , a pay - rise to his £ 30,000 - a - week deal after a good season			0
' i do n’t want to sound like an old f * * t but they get paid too much too soon , ' said @entity3			1
' it has to have an effect			0
i got paid £ 27 - a - week when i was 17 on a youth training scheme at @entity121			0
did i like it ? no , i did n’t but looking back it did me the world of good			0
' i had to clean the boots and clean the toilets			0
the only time i was allowed in the first - team dressing room was to put the boots out , but there was a hunger and desire for me to get into that dressing room			0
' i would dearly love that old apprenticeship to come back			0
i hated it at the time , but it did n’t half give me a good grounding			0
' @entity41 at 50 , @entity153 , 10.35pm friday 22 august .			1

@entity155 *legend* @entity3 was *unhappy* with his country 's displays
@entity3 *remains* behind @entity20 despite @entity13 's poor *campaign*
the @entity41 pundit believes @entity13 's young starlets are overpaid
