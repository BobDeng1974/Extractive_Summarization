i wish @entity1 and his staff had stayed out in @entity3 at the @entity4 because there is so much to learn here			1
the battle for the future of @entity9 football starts straight away and there are so many different tactics and systems to watch and learn from at this tournament			1
you have to put your disappointment at going out early to one side and find inspiration			2
back home : @entity1 returned straight to @entity19 after their @entity4 exit it ’s not difficult here : it ’s like the car show at the @entity25 , you want to see what the other manufacturers are up to			1
so it ’s good to see managers such as @entity30 and @entity31 out here lapping it up			0
yes , managers might be looking for a signing or two but it ’s more about improving tactically and finding out what ’s in vogue			0
@entity30 is just the type of man who is brave enough to innovate			0
and the men given the task of rebuilding @entity19 are not here			1
let ’s hope @entity1 , @entity43 and @entity44 are watching all these games together at home , looking for the system to improve @entity19 ’s fortunes			1
hanging around : @entity31 has remained in @entity3 to take in the tournament scouting : as has @entity50 boss @entity30 it ’s important to watch the games as a team so you can bounce ideas off each other and discuss how certain systems could work			1
these teams are show - casing their systems so our think tank should be here			0
if they ’re not watching , we ’re in trouble because we ’re light - years behind			0
these are some of the systems and tactics that have impressed me			0
@entity69 ’s midfield trio the midfield three that @entity69 used so successfully is based around its flexibility			1
@entity71 used @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 in the centre of midfield , but unlike an @entity9 three , they swapped positions all the time			0
when you watch @entity81 or @entity19 , for example , it is clear that @entity83 is the holding midfielder and there are two ahead of him			1
power trio : @entity69 midfielders @entity72 and @entity73 have impressed @entity69 ’s midfielders just rotate all the time , which makes them very hard to defend against			1
they offered great protection to the back three , too , which was necessary considering @entity91 and @entity92 were relegated with their clubs last season and @entity96 has been released by @entity97			0
if anyone does try to mimic it in the @entity101 , @entity98 is the man to counter it			0
his @entity104 side man - marked @entity69 ’s midfield three and they ended up winning the game comfortably			1
underlapping full backs @entity19 ’s full backs were rigid during our three games , generally stuck near the touchline			2
watch @entity113 and you will see the problems their full backs give the opposition			2
@entity118 — who did not impress during his loan spell at @entity120 last season — and @entity122 are key to @entity113 ’s attack , making underlapping runs inside their wingers			2
people are n’t sure how to track them			0
under - lapper : @entity118 has impressed at full - back for @entity113 it ’s something @entity129 has done for @entity50 and @entity130 for @entity81 so there is no reason @entity19 could n’t use the tactic			1
@entity134 are very good at pushing their full backs forward too			0
from the off , they are dictating to the opposition , creating a feeling of expression throughout the team			0
players are adaptable @entity145 started the game against @entity147 on the left wing			0
later he moved to the right wing then to right back and excelled in all			0
@entity69 ’s @entity72 played at the front of the midfield three against @entity3 but has been a centre back at times for his club @entity153			1
adaptable : @entity145 played in several different roles for @entity104 @entity155 @entity156 got @entity157 out of trouble so many times against @entity160 — again and again rushing out of his box to clear danger			2
it ’s something we have seen @entity165 do for @entity166 in the @entity101 but others may look at it			0
i ca n’t see it suiting @entity19 , however , as @entity171 has had trouble coming off his line in the past			2
like @entity156 , you need to have the pace of a central defender			2
sweeper keeper : @entity156 has been quick off his line for @entity157 this @entity4 let ’s hope @entity1 and his team are n’t missing all this			1
those of us lucky enough to be out here have got a window on some of the best thinking in football as it is played out in @entity3			2
@entity19 ’s coaching team really should be here .			1

@entity1 and his coaching staff should have stayed in @entity3 to learn , believes @entity191
@entity19 need to find a new system to improve in the future
@entity69 ***'s*** midfield , @entity113 ***'s*** *fluidity* and @entity156 ***'s*** *goalkeeping* are amongst the things to have impressed @entity191 at the @entity4 so far
