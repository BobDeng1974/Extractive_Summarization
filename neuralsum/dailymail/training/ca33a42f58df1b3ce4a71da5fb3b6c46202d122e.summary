@entity8 's new @entity7 deep recovery face cream contains thymosin , which can help to regenerate tissue in damaged human hearts			1
women who tested the £ 20 cream reported feeling eight years younger they were particularly happy to see that the fine lines on their foreheads , cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away			1
the night cream , which goes on sale today , is the first to harness the healing powers of thymosin beta - 4			2

women who used the cream were happy to see that the fine lines on their foreheads , cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away ( file picture ) but while levels of thymosin beta - 4 are high in our late 20s and early 30s , they fall as we age			2

so , scientists from @entity8 ’s research and development department in @entity47 screened more than two million compounds for ones that turn up the body ’s own production of the protein			2
they hit on two compounds , including a @entity55 plant used in @entity57 medicine , and incorporated them into the cream			0
the face cream also contains other ingredients designed to protect the skin against day to day wear and tear			1

@entity78 , the @entity8 scientist behind the £ 20 cream ’s development , said it was inspired by ‘ powerful medical advances ’			1
he added : ‘ what we are doing is bringing new , healthy cells to where they are needed			0
