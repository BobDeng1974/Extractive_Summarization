by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 06:54 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 14 january 2013 @entity3 often only learns about government decisions when they are reported by the media , his former policy guru has revealed			1
painting a shambolic picture of the @entity10 operation , @entity7 said the inability of @entity12 to control government decisions was ‘ pretty horrific ’			1
‘ very often you ’ll wake up in the morning and hear on the radio or the news or see something in the newspapers about something the government is doing , ’ he said			2
@entity3 's former strategy guru @entity7 ( left ) has revealed that the prime minister often finds out about his own government 's policies through the radio and in newspapers ‘ and you think , well , hang on a second – it ’s not just that we did n’t know it was happening , but we do n’t even agree with it ! the government can be doing things ... and we do n’t agree with it ? how can that be ? ’ mr @entity7 revealed that ministers spend only 30 per cent of their time dealing with the government ’s priorities , with 40 per cent spent handling diktats from the @entity38 and the rest on ‘ random things ... which were not anything to do with the coalition agreement ’			1
he described how no 10 is frequently left out of the loop as important policy changes are pushed through by ‘ paper - shuffling ’ civil servants who made life ‘ impossible ’ for ministers by drowning them in paperwork			2
‘ the bureaucracy masters the politicians , ’ he said			2
mr @entity7 , who is credited with masterminding mr @entity3 ’s ‘ detoxification ’ of the @entity54 in opposition , is regarded as his closest friend in politics and spent years as his policy adviser			1
@entity7 , who was the prime minister 's ' blue skies thinker ' and remains one of his closest friends , said @entity3 often opposes the measures his own ministers put forward born in 1969 , a child of @entity66 immigrants , @entity7 was a scholarship boy at @entity67 and studied @entity68 at @entity69			1
he met @entity3 when he was seconded from @entity70 to work on @entity72 ’s 1992 election - when he came up with the ' @entity74 ' advertisement			1
@entity7 set up a marketing consultancy , @entity76 which worked with @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
he was widely credited with his rebranding the ' nasty party ' and turning @entity81 into ' @entity82 '			0
@entity7 's role was seen as marketing the prime minister for the more liberal audience who had switched to @entity86 in 1997			1
it is believed @entity88 in the biting tv satire @entity89 is based on @entity7			2
he would often walk around @entity90 without shoes on , and hosted meetings in stockinged feet			0
his controversial and radical views , including scrapping maternity leave , abolishing @entity96 , suspending consumer rights laws for nine months ' to see what would happen ' and ignoring some @entity38 employment regulations , drew strong criticism from all parties			0
in march last year he announced he was taking a 12 - month ‘ sabbatical ’ teaching at @entity103 in @entity104			0
friends said he had become disillusioned with the difficulty of driving through reforms			0
he became so frustrated by the civil service that he tried to persuade mr @entity3 to slash the number of @entity112 officials by two - thirds – only to be blocked by the cabinet secretary			2
his reported comments came during a lecture to students in @entity104			0
mr @entity7 complained that the paperwork associated with everyday decisions was impossible for ministers and special advisers to wade through , so many policy changes were simply nodded through			1
‘ they can be quite trivial things but they can be quite serious as well , and they can certainly affect the real world , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s how you end up with stuff happening that the government is doing that the people running the government do n’t know about , or disagree with			0
when you start thinking about how things get decided , it ’s pretty incredible ... it ’s a brilliant system for paper - shuffling people to be in control			0
’ asked about the comments , a @entity130 source said : ‘ we do n’t recognise the picture he has painted			0
it ’s just @entity7 being @entity7			2
’ but his description of life in no 10 is strikingly similar to that painted by mr @entity3 ’s deputy chief of staff , @entity150 , who said last year : ‘ the first thing i do in the morning ... is turn on the today programme and hear what ’s going on			1
hopefully , we will have some sense of what ’s coming up anyway , but often you ’ll get surprised			0
’ mr @entity3 was critical of @entity74 ’s ‘ control freak ’ approach and determined to allow ministers more freedom			1
but no 10 has been wrong - footed by announcements on everything from selling off forests to scrapping school milk , which have had to be reversed .			0

former strategy guru @entity7 said @entity3 often opposes the measures his own ministers put forward
he said the coalition only spent about 30 per cent of its time implementing its own reform programme
