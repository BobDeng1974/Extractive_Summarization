by @entity0 published : 07:44 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 20 august 2013 ducks and geese have been banned from eating white bread at a nature reserve because keepers are concerned it is making them fat			1
they claim families are arriving with bin bags full of white loaves to feed the birds at ponds in a @entity15 country park , where they have been for the past 36 years			1
but officials say the creatures have now piled on the pounds , and as a result conservationists have had to put the hundreds of birds at @entity20 , in @entity21 , on a diet			1
ducks have been banned from eating white bread at a nature reserve because keepers are concerned it is making them fat some of the fat geese at @entity20 which are being overfed by visitors			1
the weight gain shows in the thickness of the geese 's legs in a bid to cut out the huge quantities of carbohydrates being consumed by the birds , members of the public will be stopped from feeding them bread			1
the park shop has also stopped selling bread , and instead will be offering wildlife lovers ' healthy pellets '			1
@entity44 , 55 , the park ’s conservation officer since 1990 , said he had no doubt white bread was the reason his ducks had become so plump			2
he said : ' about 90 per cent of people bring white bread to feed the ducks			2
' if you put your children on an exclusive diet of bread then they would get fat too			1
' people come along and think they are n’t getting fed but then ten minutes later somebody else will turn up with a big bag full			0
' the weight issues were really apparent in some of our geese as well			0
' their stomachs and inside between their legs were nearly touching the ground			0
' visitors to the park have been given the commercially available healthy duck pellets for the last four months , after the problem was first identified			2
park wardens now plan to clamp down on the bread ban further amid concerns birth defects in chicks is linked to their parents living exclusively on white loaves			1
one condition , called angel wing , saw some of the ducklings and goslings unable to fly when their feathers grew in at protruding angles			0
it left them vulnerable to attacks from dogs and foxes but now mr @entity44 has revealed that the situation has drastically improved			0
they claim families are arriving with bin bags full of white loaves to feed the birds at ponds in a @entity15 country park , where they have been for the past 36 years @entity44 , 55 , the park 's conservation officer since 1990 , said he had no doubt white bread was the reason his ducks , geese and swans had become so plump bread handouts led to the ducks , geese and swans on the pond crowding around the park visitor centre in a ' quacking mob ' rather than foraging for themselves			1
a a fence has been erected around the water edge , and new feeding platforms installed , in a bid to control the birds ’ weight			2
mr @entity44 added : ' the pellets we are using can float on the surface on the water and it encourages the ducks to forage naturally			0
the birds have now been placed on a diet by keepers who will only allow visitors to feed them healthy pellets ' since we brought in the changes there has already been a drastic improvement			1
' we do n’t have a rat problem any more and we do n’t have any issues with angel wing among the ducklings			0
' a spokesperson from the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) confirmed that obesity in birds is something that needs to be looked at across the @entity141			0
@entity142 , from the @entity137 , said : ' quite a few people are worried about how much white bread is being fed to ducks			0
' we ’re trying to encourage a more natural diet - nuts , fruit and seeds - where possible			0
' when you ’ve got ducks on a pond , that ’s all they ’re doing , sitting on the pond and eating , so they do tend to eat too much food and gain that extra weight			0
' @entity158 was opened in 1976 where both wild and domestic birds have lived on the pond in @entity20 .			2

birds have piled on weight at @entity20 , @entity21
now wardens have put them on diet and *replaced* bread with ' health pellets '
visitors to the park have also been banned from bringing in loaves
