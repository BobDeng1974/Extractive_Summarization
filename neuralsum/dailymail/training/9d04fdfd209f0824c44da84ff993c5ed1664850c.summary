@entity18 , 40 , died after @entity7 smashed him in the face in an unprovoked attack			1
yesterday the @entity21 ruled @entity23 ’s four - year term was not unduly lenient even though the 21 - year - old is likely to serve just half of that			1
the decision sparked public anger and mr @entity18 ’s mother @entity29 said it showed criminals were not being held to account			1
the 71 - year - old added : ‘ in this country people can get away with anything , not through the police , but through the courts			1
‘ my sympathies are with the police who do a brilliant job			2
the police have done their duty but the judicial system has n’t			0
the judicial system is a soft touch			0
‘ i did n’t think it was justice for @entity18 at the time but it ’s now gone to the highest court in the land			1
if the highest court says that ’s ok then i respect that			0
‘ it ’s best not to have any revenge			0

lord @entity92 said it was ‘ within the reasonable range available to the trial judge ’			0
however he added : ‘ we readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern			0
