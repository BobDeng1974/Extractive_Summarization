by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 11:51 est , 24 august 2012 most people would send valuable items by recorded delivery at the very least			2
while anyone posting a rare piece of art worth thousands of pounds by one of the world 's greatest painters would almost certainly go to great lengths for it to be protected			1
but one @entity14 museum 's attempt to save money has come back to haunt them after the had a @entity17 etching sent in the post - only for it to get lost			1
the @entity19 in @entity20 , about 50 miles south of @entity21 , bought from a @entity23 dealer a copy of @entity17 's ' @entity25 , @entity26 , writing - master ' for an exhibition			1
missing : @entity17 's @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity31 etching which a @entity14 gallery bought a copy of for $ 8,500 only for it to be lost in the post they wanted to save money on courier and insurance costs of it coming from the @entity23 - and chose for it to be delivered in the post			1
but everything did not go to plan			0
and as days past by without the work arriving through the letter box it became clear that the virtually irreplaceable had been lost			0
' using a courier or special insurance is quite expensive so we have used regular mail until now , ' @entity47 , the gallery 's chairman said			1
' it is worth around 40,000 to 50,000 crowns ( $ 6,900 - $ 8,600 ) and the postal service is offering us compensation of 500 - 1,000 crowns			0
' @entity47 said his gallery , which is displaying works by @entity60 , @entity17 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , received notice to pick up the package but when he went to collect it , it was nowhere to be found			2
@entity47 declined to name the seller , citing confidentiality concerns			0
the @entity19 in @entity20 near @entity21 , that refused to pay for couriers for the rare @entity17 is bought from @entity23			0
it was then lost in the post ' we are sorry that this has happened ; we have advised him to use a more appropriate form of mail when sending items that are worth as much as this with the appropriate insurance connected , ' said @entity79 @entity17 was a dutch painter and etcher who is considered to be one of the greatest painters in @entity86 art. his works include the @entity88 on the @entity89 , 1633 , and @entity90 , 1632			1
the @entity92 artists @entity93 is valued at a staggering $ 305,000,000			0
while in 2009 , his ' @entity94 ' sold for $ 36m at @entity95 in @entity96			0
master : an early self - portrait of @entity17 and right , a later portrait of the great @entity92 master if the lost etching was stolen in the post , it will join a register of missing pieces of work that stands at an incredible £ 1bn , according according to the @entity107			1
the organisation claims that there are 350,000 stolen works of art in the world			0
it is not clear what would happen to the picture if somebody found it in the post but it would be hard for them to sell it legally without attracting the attention of the authorities			2
a model stands by @entity17 's portrait of an unknown man , painted in 1658 , hangs in @entity95 's auction house where it was priced at £ 25m value : a @entity95 's employee displays @entity17 's ' a man in a gorget and cap ' in 2010 before it sold for £ 8.5m experts say such works often ' go underground ' where they trade for just five to 10 per cent of their true value			1
@entity140 's @entity139 - valued at $ 500m is thought to be the most highly valued stolen work of art in the world			2
@entity145 's @entity144 has still not surfaced since it was stolen from the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 , in 2010			2
it is valued at $ 55m .			0
