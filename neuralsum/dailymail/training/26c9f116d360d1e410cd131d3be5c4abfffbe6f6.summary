nobody should be shocked that @entity1 is doing what he 's doing			1
anybody who watched him at @entity5 , and @entity7 before that , were well aware of this guy 's class and quality , his work - rate and attitude			0
signing him was a no - brainer , i hope @entity15 did n't waste too much money on scouting reports on a signing who was so obviously going to improve what they had			1
but fair play to @entity22 for making it happen			2
i look for shrewdness and value when it comes to judging transfers			0
signing players all of us knew were good does n't make you a sharp operator in the market			2
and as good as @entity1 has been , he did n't solve the more obvious problems holding @entity15 back			1
and this is where @entity22 has to put his reputation on the line			2
those two could cause havoc – i 'm excited at the prospect of seeing them both play together for a run of games			0
but with other areas of the team in need of repair and quality , @entity22 needs to finally have a good january transfer window			1
he needs to sign players who solve problems – just as @entity66 did when he landed @entity67 and @entity68 this summer			0
for years the @entity22 apologists have used the building of an expensive stadium to excuse his lack of success			2
they nodded in pathetic agreement when he declared fourth place is a trophy			1
he built a stadium with his bare hands and did well to reach the @entity79 at the same time			0
that 's been the mantra			0
if that 's true , @entity22 has to follow it up with years of sustained @entity85 and @entity79 domination to make it all worthwhile			1
let 's see if that happens			0
@entity15 currently find themselves fourth in the @entity85 table - a familiar position in recent times @entity91 boss @entity66 brought in @entity67 to solve his midfield problem in the summer - now @entity22 must do likewise at @entity15 in january @entity1 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity39 and @entity94 during @entity15 's 3 - 0 win over @entity96 that mantra also ignores @entity22 's more obvious tactical failings – witness the destruction suffered at @entity100 and @entity91 last season - and the consistent failure to compete with big teams tactically , his inability to change games with substitutions or systems			1
he keeps making the same errors			0
but regardless of your view on @entity22 – and even @entity15 fans are split on whether the manager should stay or go – they now have @entity1 and @entity39 , a potentially lethal combination			1
so what will @entity22 do in january to enhance the club 's chances of winning the title , or being @entity118 champions ? now , the pressure is on @entity22			1
just how good is he ? what can he do in january ? surely he wo n't sit back and admire his shiny @entity1 , hoping that @entity121 will stay fit to solve his midfield problems ? surely he can spot the weaknesses and address them in january ? @entity22 issues instructions during a training session ahead of their match against @entity41 @entity22 leads the team talk as @entity15 train ahead of their @entity79 clash with @entity41 previously the @entity15 manager has questioned the quality available in this upcoming window			1
well last january is when @entity91 signed @entity133 , a player who would definitely improve @entity15 right now			2
@entity22 has promised to sign a defender in january , he also needs a holding midfielder and a truly top - class goalkeeper in my opinion			2
the stadium is built , the money is there , no more excuses			0
the problems in the team seem obvious , but will the manager do his job and solve them ? now is the time even his biggest apologists will surely judge @entity22			0
@entity149 is a fighter - wenger			0

signing @entity1 has proved a shrewd move by @entity22
@entity15 are also *welcoming* @entity39 back from injury
but @entity22 still needs to *strengthen* in the january transfer window
@entity15 must move beyond *thinking* fourth place is good enough
*gunners* host @entity41 in @entity79 on *tuesday* night
