when @entity2 lecturer @entity1 fell from a cliff 50 feet high in 2004 , he feared his love of mountain biking might be over			1
with extensive leg injuries that would confine him to a wheelchair for a year , he realised there were other similar people in his position who were unable to ride a standard two - wheeled mountain bike			1
so he decided to design and build a bike with four wheels that could be ridden by disabled people , and the fruits of his labour are now starting to materialise			2
he decided to start the project , giving disabled people the chance to mountain bike , after falling from a cliff and suffering leg injuries in 2004 his endeavour is called @entity18 , an initiative supported by the @entity27 through @entity28			1
called the @entity30 , this $ 2500 ( £ 1,500 ) bike can ride with ease across snow and ice , and also across curbs and steps			0
the father and son inventors claim its two front wheels give the bike far more stability			0
the idea came from experiencing the challenges of carrying a surfboard on a bike with a surf rack to a local surf break and having to dismount to push the bike up stairs and through deep sand , the firm said			0
the company experimented with several designs , and now @entity55 roll through deep sand and up short flights of stairs			0
enduro has the goal of designing and manufacturing a prototype four - wheeled mountain bike			1
this is predominantly for use by disabled people – although it seems others are n’t disqualified from enjoying the bike either			2
the bike , a collaboration with @entity70 , is ‘ powered ’ by gravity alone			0
it has no pedals , with the ‘ rider ’ instead sitting in a seat between all four wheels			0
a set of handlebars then allows them to steer as they make their way down a course			0
the bike is built with carbon - fibre seating and top - end suspension			2
its aim is to encourage extreme sports enthusiasts to grasp the concept of ‘ gravity biking ’ – cycling at top speeds downhill			0
the first prototype was unveiled back in february , and the team have now been testing a second prototype in @entity95 , north @entity96			1
the second builds upon the design , comfort and safety issues identified in the first			0
and @entity18 is beginning to make an impact on the extreme sports market			1
mountain bikers make their way down @entity105 led by @entity106 with the four - wheeler mountain bike in north wales			1
the prototype four wheeler bicycle is believed to be only the second - ever manufactured in the world it ’s believed that innovations such as these will continue to lead the way for the future development of both bike manufacturing and healthcare products for disabled people			1
and the goal is now to officially launch the product , which is built entirely in @entity96 , onto the market by december 2014			2
‘ the project is developing well beyond our initial aspirations , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ as time goes on more trails are becoming available to ride the bikes and we are having enquiries from potential riders from across the world			0
‘ hopefully we will see a race series soon , where able bodied and disabled athletes will be competing head to head at @entity27 trail centres			0
’ @entity18 is an endeavour to design and manufacture a bike predominantly for use by disabled people			1

a team of engineers in @entity96 have designed a four - wheeled bike
the bike is *intended* to allow disable people to enjoy downhill racing
known as @entity18 it has been in the works since 2004
prototype was unveiled in february and has now been tested on @entity105
project manager @entity1 hopes it will make racing more *accessible*
