by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:50 est , 12 november 2013 @entity3 : 20:25 est , 12 november 2013 @entity6 public life is dominated by a privileged private school elite , education secretary @entity4 admitted yesterday			1
he said former prime minister sir @entity8 was right to speak out about the ‘ shocking ’ domination of a small elite			1
sir @entity8 ’s intervention this week made uncomfortable reading for @entity14 , who attended @entity15 and whose @entity16 is dominated by former public schoolboys			1
@entity18 said the prime minister believed ‘ what counts is not where you come from but where you are going ’			0
agreement : @entity4 said it was an ' inescapable fact ' that sir @entity8 was right about the dominance of a privileged private school elite sir @entity8 has increased his public profile in recent weeks , demanding a windfall tax on energy companies , urging action to help the ' silent have - nots ' and warning about a lack of social mobility			1
his latest remarks were seen as a thinly - veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of @entity14 's government , in contrast to sir @entity8 's own upbringing in a rented flat in @entity41 , @entity42			1
during a speech to the @entity44 on friday evening , sir @entity8 said : ‘ in every single sphere of @entity6 influence , the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class			1
‘ to me , from my background , i find that truly shocking			2
’ @entity18 rejected the criticism , insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians			0
but mr @entity4 , who was adopted at just four months , insisted sir @entity8 was ' right '			1
he told @entity57 : ' it ’s an inescapable fact			0
and that ’s one of the reasons why both i was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children do n’t suffer from neglect and do n’t have their futures blighted			0
' it ’s also why we ’re reforming the schools system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread			2
' as the prime minister said , he ’s in business , in politics to spread great education , to make opportunity more equal and that ’s what ’s happening			0
' mr @entity14 , who went to @entity15 , is vulnerable to charges that his cabinet is dominated by a privileged elite			1
and some wavering @entity82 believe he should change tack and bring back grammar schools to help poorer children			0
but mr @entity14 ’s spokesman said yesterday : ‘ at the heart of this is the importance of building what the prime minister has described as an aspiration nation			2
he has said what counts is not where you come from but where you are going			0
‘ that ’s why we have put education reform and welfare reform at the heart of government policy			0
‘ i actually think that what people around their breakfast table in the morning , getting their kids ready for school … what they want to know is the government has the policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions			0
that ’s what is the most important thing			0
’ it is the second time in a month that sir @entity8 has spoken out about the dangers of out - of - touch well - heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor			1
embarrassing : both the current conservative prime minister , @entity14 , left , and his @entity122 deputy prime minister , @entity122 , right , as well as senior members of the cabinet , were privately schooled sir @entity8 blamed @entity125 for the ‘ collapse in social mobility ’ and the ‘ truly shocking ’ inequality in the @entity6			1
he criticised @entity136 's ‘ absurd mantra to be the one - nation party ’ , suggesting that ‘ they left a @entity131 divide between stagnation and aspiration ’			2
the 70 - year - old grew up in a rented flat in @entity41 and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three o - levels			2
despite his direct criticism of @entity125 policies during the speech at @entity44 ’s annual dinner , his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for @entity14			2
the prime minister was educated at @entity15 and went on to study at @entity147			1
several senior members of the @entity16 , including chancellor @entity149 and @entity122 leader @entity122 , were privately educated , as was @entity42 mayor @entity150			1
sir @entity8 suggested that @entity6 institutions should return to a system whereby ‘ sheer hard graft ’ can lead to success , rather than having to rely on privilege			1
he said : ‘ i remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost			0
' our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born , not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born			0
‘ we need them to fly as high as their luck , their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them			0
and it is n’t going to happen magically			0
