authors @entity0 and @entity2 believe it is ' an unconscious evolutionary drive ... that helps to create a loving , nurturing bond between lovers ' two men have attempted to answer the age - old question , ' why are men obsessed with breasts ? ' @entity0 and @entity2 , who recently released @entity10 : @entity11 , @entity12 , and the @entity13 , have dissected the emotional , biological and cultural reasons behind the real reason men love breasts			1
the two authors believe heterosexual men are so fascinated by women 's breasts thanks to a simple hormone released during nursing which helps to forge the powerful bond between mother and baby , which also creates an evolutionary drive for a strong nurturing bond between lovers			1
@entity30 obsessed : @entity0 and @entity2 have dissected the emotional , biological and cultural reasons behind the real reason men love breasts mr @entity0 , a leading expert in the neuroscience of social bonding , wrote a column for the @entity36 , explaining that ' biologically speaking , ' the human male breast obsession is ' pretty weird '			1
' men are the only male mammals fascinated by breasts in a sexual context , ' said mr @entity0			1
' and women are the only female mammals whose breasts become enlarged at puberty , independent of pregnancy			2
we are also the only species in which males caress , massage and even orally stimulate the female breasts during foreplay and sex			2
' he continued to say that women do enjoy attention on their breasts , after @entity56 , of the @entity57 , and @entity58 , of the @entity59 , surveyed 301 people , which included 153 women , on breast stimulation			2
' when a partner stimulates a woman 's breasts , it sparks the same series of brain events as nursing ' the results showed that stimulating the breasts or nipples enhanced sexual arousal in about 82per cent of the women , and nearly 60per cent ask to have their nipples touched , according to mr @entity0			1
the authors cite the success of @entity84 , ' men 's ' magazines like @entity78 , and about ' 100,000 years of art ' as obvious proof that men are ' extremely ' drawn to breasts			1
however , the attraction is nature , not nurture , they say			2
' boys do n't learn on the playground that breasts are something that they should be interested in			2
it 's biological and deeply engrained in our brain , ' they wrote			0
' in fact , research indicates that when we 're confronted with breasts , or even breast - related stimuli , like bras , we 'll start making bad decisions ( and not just to eat at @entity84 )			0
' evolution and hormones : the authors believe men are so fascinated by women 's breasts thanks to a simple hormone released during nursing evolutionary biologists have suggested that because full breasts are mostly made up of fat , this signaled to a man that a woman is in good health , ' therefore a top - notch prospect to bear and raise children			1
' however another hypothesis is based on the idea that many primates have sex with the male entering from behind , which has been used to explain why some female monkeys ' display elaborate rear - end advertising			0
' therefore in humans , it has been argued that women 's breasts evolved to mimic the contours of her rear			0
the authors dismiss both of these ideas , instead referencing a neurological explanation that links the same brain mechanisms used to promote a powerful bond between a mother and her infant			1
' when a woman gives birth , her newborn will engage in some pretty elaborate manipulations of its mother 's breasts , ' they wrote			0
' this stimulation sends signals along nerves and into the brain			0
there , the signals trigger the release of a neurochemical called oxytocin from the brain 's hypothalamus			0
' this oxytocin release eventually stimulates smooth muscles in a woman 's breasts to eject milk , making it available to her nursing baby			0
' they continued : ' but oxytocin release has other effects , too			0
when released at the baby 's instigation , the attention of the mother focuses on her baby			0
the infant becomes the most important thing in the world			0
why men loves breasts : the authors of @entity179 : @entity11 , @entity12 , and the @entity13 have answered the eternal question ' @entity183 , acting in concert with dopamine , also helps imprint the newborn 's face , smell and sounds in the mother 's reward circuitry , making nursing and nurturing a feel - good experience , motivating her to keep doing it and forging the mother - infant bond			1
this bond is not only the most beautiful of all social bonds , it can also be the most enduring , lasting a lifetime			2
' essentially , ' when a partner touches , massages or nibbles a woman 's breasts , it sparks the same series of brain events as nursing , ' they explained			0
humans are also among the very few animals that have sex face - to - face , ' looking into each other 's eyes			0
' the authors conclude that this ' quirk ' of human sexuality has evolved to ' exploit the ancient mother - infant bonding brain circuitry as a way to help form bonds between lovers			1
' because an oxytocin release focuses the brain 's attention to a partner 's face , smell , and voice , the authors believe that the combination of oxytocin release from breast stimulation , and the increase of dopamine from the excitement of foreplay and face - to - face sex , helps to create an ' association of the lover 's face and eyes with the pleasurable feelings , building a bond in the women 's brain '			1
far from being creepy , the authors say , a man 's fascination with breasts is ' an unconscious evolutionary drive prompting us to activate powerful bonding circuits that help create a loving , nurturing bond			1

authors @entity0 and @entity2 believe it is ' an unconscious evolutionary drive ... that helps to create a loving , nurturing bond between lovers '
