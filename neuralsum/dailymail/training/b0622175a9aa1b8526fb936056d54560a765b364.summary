by @entity0 published : 13:23 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 5 november 2013 to most people , free massages at the office and unlimited servings of gourmet food would help turn a workplace into a mini oasis			1
but to a growing number of former @entity12 employees , the company 's well - publicized perks are not enough to keep them happy at their jobs and now they 've taken to the internet to complain about the noisy massage chairs in the nap rooms and overly enthusiastic , loyal corporate following			1
the confessional - type blog posts on a @entity21 thread show a side of the @entity12 machine that is not often revealed , as many outsiders only focus on the perks that have helped earn the internet company the top spot on @entity29 ’s list of the best companies to work for multiple times in a row			1
the google fifteen : too much good food causes workers to gain weight ‘ it sounds like a first - world problem			2
i put on 18 kilos while working at @entity12 , ’ one anonymous blogger who used to work out of the company 's @entity36 office wrote on the @entity21 thread			1
more play than work : many former employees took issue with the ' immature ' attitudes of their colleagues , comparing the @entity49 @entity12 complex to a fraternity house ‘ but they also provided access to great gym within the office			1
one of my colleagues lost 20 - 30 kilos while i was there			2
but with so much food around , it was hard to resist and soon i realized that i was eating whenever i was bored or thinking			2
’ another contributor who identified himself as @entity60 wrote that staffers regularly gained ' 5 - 15 pounds from the ( copious , good , free ) food , ' but went on to characterize his complaints as ' mostly harmless '			1
some of the perks that draw people in can become their own issues within the office as well , as one post talks about the drama that erupted over noisy massage chairs in a satellite office			2
' in @entity72 there is a quiet room where people go to relax , or take a nap			2
there are very nice looking fish tanks there and you can waste as much of your work time there , watching the fish do fishy things , ' one anonymous person wrote , as highlighted by @entity86			0
' there was a 100 + emails thread about removing the massage chairs from that room because some people allegedly were being kept from sleeping because the massage chairs were too noisy			0
' cramped quarters : three to five employees are assigned to a single ' pod ' where they work over-hyped jobs for over achievers one frequent complaint came from high expectations that apparently did not meet the reality			0
‘ the constant professional boredom and intellectual malaise that 's always saccharine sugar coated by a layer of constant awe on the part of people you meet outside @entity12 who want to know all about the perks , the culture and the interview without ever really asking about the work , ’ a different anonymous blogger wrote			1
' @entity12 is like joining a fraternity in college , it 's hard to get in because they make you jump through irrelevant hoops to do so ' - former employee @entity118 ‘ i habitually describe my time working as an @entity120 monkey as being like a janitor at the @entity122			1
you know that theoretically great world changing things are going on in the building , but all you ever really see is s * * *			0
’ a cottage industry dedicated to helping people get an interview at the company and lists off various riddles and mind games played on previous applicants			0
for some , the mental fun stopped there			0
' the only intellectual stimulation i encountered in my time there was the interview process			0
not that i met that many brilliant people , but i did meet a lot of fairly mediocre people that were convinced they were brilliant , and i saw a lot of political ass kissing , ' wrote @entity144			0
too cool for school : some thought that the task of getting a job at @entity12 was more competitive than the work that they actually had to do once they had one applicants jump through hoops ' like they 're joining a fraternity ' the company 's reputation helps to attract some of the brightest minds in the business , but the virtual dissenters say that those skilled workers are part of the problem			1
‘ i habitually describe my time working as an @entity120 monkey as being like a janitor at the @entity122			0
you know that theoretically great world changing things are going on in the building , but all you ever really see is s * * * ' - an anonymous former employee ‘ the worst part of working for @entity12 is the people			1
in order to get in to work at @entity12 you have to be the kind of person who " whoops " when your ceo comes in the conference room			1
and screams with excitement when they announce " we 've introduced ... searching by pictures ! ! ! " as a new product , ’ a person with the username @entity118 wrote			0
‘ you need to think it 's cool to be a " @entity184 "			0
yes , the old guard in @entity12 like to call themselves @entity186 , and when you first join you are a " new googler " or " @entity184 " as they like to call you			1
and they think this is cool when they tell you that			0
‘ @entity12 is like joining a fraternity in college , it 's hard to get in because they make you jump through irrelevant hoops to do so , this filters out the high achievers and really intelligent candidates who realize that the world is a big place and they do n't have time to sit in an egg pod and do a psychometric test to get a job			1
’ feeding frenzy : the company has a so - called 150 foot rule which mandates that there have to be pantries with snacks or cafeterias spread throughout the offices another contributor , who claims to have used his real name in the post and worked at @entity12 for more than three years , says that pride is a sticking point that prevents an open flow of ideas			1
' i think the average level of @entity12 engineers is mediocre			2
with a lot of arrogance , too			0
everybody believes he ( males dominate ) is better than his neighbor , ' @entity226 wrote			0
' objective discussions are pretty rare , since everybody 's territorial , and not interested in opinions of other people unless those people are important gods			0
' all of these issues have not had enough of an impact to lessen the so - called @entity12 mystique , as more than a million candidates apply to work at the company every year with a hiring rate of less than one per cent .			2

former staffers are *lashing* out at @entity12 online , *blasting* their former colleagues immaturity and the menial tasks they were assigned
the internet giant has *boasted* of their perks like free food , massages , nap rooms , and *memberships* to *extensive* sports courts
