@entity4 , 31 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , had been in hospital after welcoming her fifth child when her husband , @entity9 , decided to clear out their home and sell unused items at a community garage sale on june 1st			1
unbeknown to him , though , she had hidden her precious ring in an old watch box , which ended up being among the items for sale			1
i was in the hospital , i just had a baby , so my husband thought it would be fun for my other kids if they could sell some things at the garage sale			0
accident : mr @entity37 , who ' felt terrible ' , had thought the watch box was empty and no longer useful , so decided to sell it ' he did n’t know that before i went to the hospital , i put my ring in that box			1
i wanted the ring to be in a safe place and out of reach from my two - year - old twins			1
' mrs @entity4 realized her ring was missing when she came home from hospital on june 5th			1
' i go into my husband ’s closet , ca n’t find the box , and then he tells me he sold it , ' she recalled			2
' i said , " you sold it ? what do you mean you sold it ? " i immediately started crying			0
' mr @entity37 , who ' feels really terrible , ' says the box was purchased by a blonde woman who had been mulling over whether to buy it or not			0
the couple are hoping that the buyer is honest enough to come forth and return the ring			0
honest mistake : @entity65 who had been given the box by her mother , the buyer , happened to see a news story about the lost ring , and promptly emailed the @entity70 to let them know it had been found ' i 'm very , very , very upset , ' mrs @entity4 said			1
' i 'm trying to remain optimistic but i do n’t know anymore			0
there ’s a small chance whoever bought the box does n’t know the ring is in there			1
' i would never , ever keep the ring if i had found it , ' she added			0
' if you 're honest , you ’re honest			0
clearly , the ring was in the box by accident			2
