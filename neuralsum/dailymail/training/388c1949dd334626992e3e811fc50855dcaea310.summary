the inspiration for @entity2 ’s new nemesis ? well , that ’s elementary			0
the show ’s co-creator has previously gone on record criticising a certain real - life foreign press baron who is an unashamed capitalist			1
so it was little surprise when @entity12 ’ new enemy was unveiled in last night ’s series finale – as a sinister foreign newspaper baron and unashamed capitalist			1
the detective describes his enemy @entity17 – played by @entity19 actor @entity18 – as a ‘ shark ’ who uncovers secrets about the great and the good which he uses to blackmail them			1
none of them can turn my stomach like @entity17			0
’ as for the rest of the show , in a dramatic plot twist , dr @entity37 ’s new wife , @entity36 , shoots @entity2 , played by @entity29 , after @entity17 discovers that she had a secret past as an assassin for foreign intelligence agencies			0
she then steals the identity of a dead woman to marry the detective ’s sidekick			0
luckily , she ensures the shot is not fatal , enabling @entity2 to recover and later turn a gun on the villain			0
the not - so - subtle depiction of the evil press baron was created by the series ’ co-writer , @entity51 , who has previously ranted against right - wing media and declared his dislike of the conservatives			1
' none can turn my stomach like @entity17 ' : the show 's new villain shares has similarities to another foreign press baron in an interview with the @entity66 before the last general election in march 2010 , he declared : ‘ i hope the @entity68 do n’t win			1
let ’s not beat around the bush			0
’ former teacher mr @entity51 also launched a scathing attack on @entity72 , the son of @entity74 and the then head @entity76 , which owns the @entity75 , @entity75 and the @entity78 he said : ‘ are we really going to put @entity72 in place of [ the @entity81 ] ? ‘ can you imagine how s * * * everything would be ? never mind the fine and glorious things that the @entity81 does , imagine how s * * * everything would be ! stuff would be s * * * ! let ’s not have really good restaurants , let ’s have @entity91 ! ’ in another possible indication of the views of the show ’s creators , @entity2 himself was seen reading a copy of the @entity66 during last night ’s episode			1
and is not the first time the show has been accused of blatant left - wing bias ; the previous episode featured a thinly veiled attack on @entity104 , calling the mayor of london ‘ dithering , incoherent , and self - interested ’			1
mr @entity104 last week accused the @entity81 of bias after a spoof newspaper story which flashed up briefly on screen during an earlier episode of @entity2			2
shock : dr @entity37 's new wife , @entity36 , shoots @entity2 in a rather dramatic twist in the series finale the mock article revolved around the mayor of @entity117 turning the @entity118 into a motorway			1
although mr @entity104 was not mentioned by name , the article said that the plans followed a list of ‘ bizarre concepts ’ , including a ‘ recently - mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary ’ – a clear reference to the mayor ’s so - called ‘ @entity129 ’ proposal			2
the page included a quote from the ‘ current mayor ’ which appeared to mock mr @entity104 ’s use of language , finishing with the exclamation ‘ huzzar ! ’ it said : ‘ when asked to explain how the system might move forward , or even be profitable , or perhaps even to explain the point , the mayor , who was at a self - promotion event , was found to be dithering , incoherent , and self - interested ’			2
mr @entity104 said afterwards : ‘ it is elementary my dear @entity37 , i deduce a simple case of @entity81 bias			0
’ he added that spending taxpayers ’ money attacking @entity150 politicians was the @entity81 ’s ‘ raison d’etre ’			0
the @entity81 insisted that the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or ‘ politically affiliated			2
