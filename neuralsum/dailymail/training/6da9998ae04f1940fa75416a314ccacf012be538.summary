the @entity1 mountains situated between the @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 provinces in @entity6 , central @entity7 , are something of a secret			1
certainly none of my friends have heard of this lovely spot , crossed by the @entity15 and @entity16 rivers , and only two hours west of @entity17			2
‘ what people do not realise about @entity24 , ’ says @entity18 , who runs her own horse riding company here , with sparky energy , ‘ is that this is not typical @entity26 — not flatlands			1
’ it is a place with open landscape , snow - capped mountains and a special quality to the light			1
pastoral perfection : the @entity1 is one of @entity7 's less known , and yet most beautiful , areas i ’m staying in @entity7 ’s first @entity37 , as a base for a three - day riding trip and general explore			1
it is a comfortable hunting lodge , built in 1928 , in @entity43 granite , by @entity44			2
it still attracts well - heeled @entity7 hunters who are allowed to shoot @entity47 in the mountains			1
and it was in this hotel that the @entity52 government drew up the @entity7 constitution			2
what overwhelms me about @entity24 is the peace			0
i once read an article claiming yellow helps lift depression			0
if that ’s true , then @entity24 must trump @entity60			0
yellow broom gilds the mountains ( there are 12 different varieties )			0
and , at @entity66 , villagers even decorate their houses with the stuff			0
in the saddle : the rivers and bridges of the @entity1 make the perfect setting for equine adventure @entity24 is a destination for road cyclists , mountaineers , para gliders , bird - watchers and astronomers ( it has recently secured ‘ dark sky ’ status for its unpolluted atmosphere )			1
it is also ideal for active families as well as those who like to do nada			0
and , it is perfection for horse riders			1
before saddling up , i walk beside the @entity92 river			0
there were glaciers here 12,000 years ago , and today , wild flowers abound : asphodel , white heather and crimson orchids			0
i ’m with @entity98 , a botanist who knows his mushrooms - of which @entity24 boasts 350 varieties			1
in autumn , you can pick them by the kilo			0
the sun shines on @entity106 ’s stables and its well - schooled horses ( @entity108 , arabs , crosses )			1
the rides are for ‘ experienced but not necessarily expert ’ riders , and i ’m delighted with @entity111 , my @entity113 bay - the equivalent of a handsome bachelor who dines out often			1
tucking in : even the horses join in with the holiday spirit most rides last a week and go through pine forests , cross the @entity92 and stop at @entity123 with its 14th - century bridge ( some of us brave a swim )			1
when the horses push through the broom , the sweet scent of vanilla is released			0
nothing is more calming than listening as we ride : cow - bells , the size of small saucepans , sound like someone doing gentle washing up , leather saddles creak and the ‘ ssshh ’ of flowing water is soporific			2
you ride for five hours a day with aperitif stops			0
a table with a white cloth is laid with almonds , cherries , cured hams and local wine - all this before an excellent lunch			2
on the last day , an exhilarating gallop ends beside @entity153 , surrounded by snow - capped mountains			2
we feel we have dismounted in paradise and the sublime picnic that materialises out of @entity159 ’s black van proves it			0
@entity160 ( 0183782544 , www.rideworldwide.com ) offers seven - night rides from £ 1,410 per person - including riding , twin hotel accommodation , most meals , mid-morning aperitifs , and airport transfers to @entity17			1

the @entity1 is a rare *slice* of mountainous *terrain* in @entity174
*tourists* know the region for @entity3 and @entity5 - but not these quiet peaks
the range 's slopes and valleys make a *wonderful* location for horse riding
