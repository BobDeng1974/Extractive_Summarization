by @entity0 new mother @entity1 pictured nuturing her red panda baby twins at their enclosure at @entity4 two rare red pandas native to the @entity7 mountains have been born at a @entity9 zoo			1
the twins , a boy and a girl , were born at @entity4 in @entity13 , @entity14 , and were discovered by head keeper @entity15 during his early morning rounds			1
female red pandas are only fertile for just one day a year and can delay implantation until conditions are favourable , a zoo spokeswoman said			1
they give birth to between one and four young at a time and the cubs are born with pale fluffy fur			1
this darkens to the distinctive red colouration of the adults over the first three months , she said			2
mr @entity15 said : ' i entered the panda enclosure and was immediately met by @entity33 , our male panda			2
' unable to see our female , @entity1 , i called to her			2
she appeared from one of the nest boxes shortly after carrying a baby gently in her mouth			0
' she brought the cub over , as if to show me , before returning to the box			0
i ca n't explain how happy i was			0
' the keepers have been keeping a close eye on the new arrivals			0
at nearly a month old , the pandas are gaining between seven and 20g a day and have just started to open their eyes			2
they will be looked after in the nest box by their mother for a while yet but will soon be venturing out to explore their surroundings , the spokeswoman said			0
red pandas are a relatively new addition to the zoo following their introduction in april 2013			1
@entity33 and @entity1 were paired as part of the @entity60 breeding programme arriving from @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 in @entity64			1
the creatures normally inhabit the @entity7 mountains of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , where they are threatened by habitat destruction and hunting			1
there are now believed to be as few as 10,000 adults left in the wild , the spokeswoman said			1
mr @entity15 added : ' i am so proud of @entity1			0
she is a natural mum and has not put a foot wrong			0
it is as if she has grown up overnight			0
' @entity81 has less to do with the babies but he seems to have an extra spring in his step and has definitely grown in confidence			0
