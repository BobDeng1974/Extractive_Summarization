by @entity0 published : 18:44 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 22:11 est , 17 january 2013 @entity2 users will now not only know where to get the best dim sum , but how clean the establishment is			1
the user review site has announced today that it is adding restaurant ’s health - inspection grades to its site , giving discerning users yet another filter through which they can decide where to eat			1
for now , the service is available in @entity14 , and @entity15 will be added within the next few weeks with plans to expand to @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
by the code : @entity2 is now including health scores in its reviews , located below the restaurants ' address details : by clicking on the score , @entity2 users can see how many violations the restaurant has and when they occurred the health departments of @entity15 have assigned letter grades – a , @entity32 , @entity31 , or fail – for dining establishments in these cities			1
for @entity14 businesses , the new program displays restaurant health scores – for example , 92 out of 100			1
anything above 90 points gets a ‘ good ’ rating , meaning there are low health risks			0
anywhere from 86 - 90 is considered adequate , 71 - 85 needs improvement , and anything less than 70 is poor			0
points are taken away for violations and are given in accordance to the severity of the violation			0
clicking on the number takes users to a page with more detailed information about the restaurant 's recent inspections			0
the company , which is itself based in @entity14 , says its engineers have been working with the cities in designing technology that lets municipalities publish inspection information on its website			2
it means , especially in @entity14 where restaurants are not required to visibly post the findings of health reports , that there will be more transparency between the health department , the city ’s restaurants , and consumer choice			1
in plain sight : @entity15 restaurants must prominently display their grade from the @entity77 , ranging from @entity78 , @entity32 , @entity31 , or grade pending grading system : in @entity15 , restaurants are awarded an a , @entity32 , @entity31 , or fail grade ; grade pending means that the restaurant initially received a b or a c but has been given a limited amount of time to improve @entity88 , 105 @entity89 – a @entity90 , 205 e. @entity91 st. – a mr @entity92 , 324 e. 57th @entity93 – a @entity95 ’s @entity94 , 220 w. 44th st. , a @entity96 , 401 bleecker st. , a the @entity77 of @entity15 has required that letter grades be posted since july 2010			2
it inspects around 24,000 restaurants a year to make sure each establishment complies with health codes			0
all @entity15 restaurants must post the @entity104 grades on the outside of their establishments			1
the code itself looks at things such as how the food is handled , the temperature at which it is served , the hygiene of the restaurant ’s employees , maintenance , and vermin control			0
restaurants are given two chances to earn an a – if they are not given an ‘ a ’ at the initial inspection , they are given around a month to improve			0
@entity2 ’s chief executive officer @entity121 said that the measures will have ‘ a good impact on society , ’ according to @entity125			2
‘ in the weeks ahead , we hope to have all of @entity14 ’s restaurants online			1
we ’ll then begin migrating @entity15 data online as well			0
’ a study from @entity130 showed that higher @entity2 ratings , even by half a star , made a restaurant more likely to have a full house for dinner .			2
