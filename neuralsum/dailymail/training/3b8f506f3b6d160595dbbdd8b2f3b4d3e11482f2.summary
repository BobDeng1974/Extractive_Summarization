by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 19:10 est , 22 january 2014 ' treat patients like people ' : health secretary @entity4 will outline plans for just one doctor to take charge of each patient in hospital @entity11 patients should be treated as people rather than a collection of body parts , @entity4 will tell doctors today			1
the health secretary warns that hospital care has become a series of ‘ brief encounters ’ with staff and calls for the end of ‘ ping pong ’ referrals that leaves patients feeling ‘ like parcels ’			1
he will today announce plans for a single doctor to take charge of each patient from the minute they are admitted to the second they are discharged			1
calling for a ‘ culture change ’ in the @entity11 , mr @entity4 will say : ‘ that means reasserting a simple truth : every patient is a person			2
‘ a person with a name			0
a person with a family			0
not just a body harbouring a pathology ; not a diagnostic puzzle ; not a four - hour target or an 18 - week problem ; not a cost pressure – and most certainly not a “ bed - blocker ”			0
’ mr @entity4 will say he has seen countless examples where care has simply concentrated on ‘ a part of the body where things had gone wrong ’			1
the @entity52 revealed last month that the @entity11 will once again write the name of the doctor responsible for each patient above their bed			0
mr @entity4 will use a speech at @entity59 ’s and @entity60 in @entity61 today to go further , saying that ‘ whole - stay doctors ’ should take charge of a patient ’s entire period in hospital – rather than pass them from one consultant to another			1
the health secretary will cite evidence from the @entity72 which found that doing so leads to lower rates of readmission and fewer cases of heart failure and pneumonia			1
he will also call for doctors to draw up fresh plans to reduce the number of ward transfers			2
evidence shows that for elderly patients , every change of ward lengthens the average stay in that ward by more than a day			2
' @entity87 ' referrals : mr @entity4 wants to end the practice of passing patients from one consultant to another ‘ the basic principle should be care being organised around where the patient is , not patients organised around where the care is , ’ he will say			1
‘ i want to see proper , seamless discharge handovers from named consultants to named gps with direct communication between both parties that ensures care is never interrupted			0
’ a @entity105 survey found that nearly a quarter of consultants rated their hospital ’s ability to deliver continuity of care as ‘ poor ’ or ‘ very poor ’			2
mr @entity4 will call for hospitals to rethink doctors ’ rotas and indicate that the government will challenge @entity115 working time edicts to improve 24 - hour care and weekend cover			1
@entity72 studies have found that having ' whole - stay doctors ' who oversea patients from the moment they are admitted to when they are discharged lowers rates of readmission and heart failure he will say : ‘ one doctor told me that hospital care today has become a series of brief encounters			1
another said there has been a loss of long - term relationships because the way rotas worked meant you often never saw the same patient twice			0
someone else spoke of a ping pong of referrals			0
’ the @entity140 has been asked to develop guidance on how to implement the changes by march			0
professor @entity143 , president of the @entity144 , welcomed a more ‘ streamlined and compassionate ’ approach to care			0
he added : ‘ we have to end the situation where patients are shuttled from one member of staff to another with no one individual taking responsibility for ensuring they receive the right treatment at the right time and in the right place			0

@entity4 says hospital care is now just a series of ' brief encounters ' with staff - leaving patients feeling ' like parcels '
the health secretary will announce plans for patients to have one doctor
this will stop patients from being passed from one consultant to another
@entity72 studies found ' whole - stay doctors ' lead to lower rates of readmission and fewer cases of heart failure and pneumonia
