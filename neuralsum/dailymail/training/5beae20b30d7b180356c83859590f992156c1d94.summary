by @entity1 reporter when @entity2 had her belongings moved from the marital home she shared with multi-millionaire art collector @entity5 into the @entity7 flat she 's staying at following their very public altercation , she probably had n't thought her @entity11 habit would be exposed			1
luckily , for the domestic goddess , it was a perfectly legal @entity11 energy drink ( £ 4.99 , firebox.com ) and not the real deal			1
the can was pictured wedged into the bottom of a @entity18 box along with her other most essential belongings , such as a blender and cookery books			0
@entity2 would appear to be a fan of @entity11 energy drinks , the high - caffeine legal tipple , packed with taurine , hemp seed extract , b vitamins and sugar , which were pictured inside one of her removal boxes the drink , branded with a marijuana leaf and billed as ‘ @entity39 's coolest energy drink ' , may be guilty of crass marketing , but its ingredients are innocent			1
it contains hemp seed extract , caffeine , taurine ( an amino acid which helps regulate the blood ) , b vitamins and a substantial 11 g of sugar , so it 'll give you a sugar high but not a narcotic one			1
