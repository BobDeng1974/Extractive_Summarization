@entity0 in @entity1 is wonky according to @entity2 when people get their hands on an @entity6 tomorrow , there will be one familiar icon missing			1
@entity8 is no longer on the @entity6 , after @entity2 decided to go it alone and produce their own @entity2 app with some help from data providers such as @entity13			1
but when it comes to the visual side of things , @entity2 faces a few bumps in the road for instance , @entity14 seems covered under a permanent veil of cloud			1
meanwhile , certain roads - such as @entity0 in @entity1 - seem a little awkward for your average motorist			0
last night the firm released the updated software for existing iphones and @entity29 which replaced @entity8 's maps with @entity2 's but it instantly faced a barrage of criticism from users who complained about missing towns , misplaced villages , satellite images covered by cloud , incorrect searches and even a farm identified as an airport			1
as the @entity6 launches , along with the new @entity44 software , many more errors are likely to come to light over the next few weeks			1
users are also encouraged to use a ' report a problem ' feature to point out errors			2
a search for @entity69 instead brings up @entity70			1
looking for @entity71 upon @entity72 sends users to a tv studio with maps being one of the most - used features on smartphones , @entity2 may find themselves in a rare situation of widespread customer dissatisfaction			1
@entity2 decided to drop @entity8 from the phone in june			2
the smartphone market is rapidly polarising between the @entity6 and @entity8 's @entity83 phones , and - along with @entity2 filing many patent lawsuits against @entity83 's biggest manufacturers - relationships have become strained over the last five years			1
it is a far cry from when the @entity6 was first announced , with @entity8 integration sold as a key feature of the phone			2
users who are dissatisfied with @entity2 's map offering can only access @entity8 by using the browser - based version , which does not offer the same usability as a bespoke app. @entity13 defended the integrity of the map software , saying it provided only the data , and was not responsible for how @entity2 used it within the app. a spokesman said : ' the user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application such as visual imagery			1
' user experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make			0
' we are confident about our map quality , as selling 65 million portable navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m @entity13 apps for @entity6 in the past two years reaffirms this quality			1
' @entity2 's maps also feature 3d versions of major cities such as @entity1			2
the poor service , if it continues , is likely to also impact many businesses			0
the @entity121 quotes a @entity123 - based blogger who runs a business repairing @entity2 goods			1
he said : ' this is incredibly different from using @entity8			0
' it 's a tremendous step backwards and something that cripples @entity44 for @entity2 's customers			2
' i [ searched ] " @entity130 " and " @entity132 " since that 's relevant to our business			0
the results broke my heart			0
' all of the work i 've put into our local recognition is completely gone			0
' meanwhile , pilots could be misled into trying to make an emergency landing in a farm because of an error on a new @entity2 map tool , justice minister @entity141 said			1
the minister has notified the technology giant of a mistake in his south @entity151 constituency and asked for it to be urgently corrected			2
@entity2 's new ios 6 maps application has placed the standard airport map symbol on the spot of a 35 - acre site called @entity156 , in @entity158 - home to a city farm , gardens and cafe			1
@entity162 , an analyst at @entity163 , said : ' @entity2 believes that they can deliver a better experience for customers than @entity8			2
' but in the short term , @entity8 has a better mapping application , and @entity6 customers will suffer			0
' however @entity169 , an analyst at @entity170 , said - despite the short - term pain - it was a wise business decision			0
he said : ' it does nâ€™t make sense for @entity2 to outsource a key part of their entire ecosystem to @entity8			0
' ' in context of @entity156 there are a variety of possible alternative images that could be utilised such as a cow , a goat , a sheep , a flower or any indeed other type of plant , as @entity156 operates a nursery , ' mr @entity141 said			0
' an aircraft is an entirely inappropriate flight of imagination			0
' the error prompted @entity192 to tweet : ' just in case anybody is confused @ @entity195 is not moving to the southside			0
' mr @entity141 said he accepts mistakes can be made but added that he was surprised to discover @entity156 being marked as an airport			1
' clearly the designation is not only wrong but is dangerously misleading in that it could result in a pilot , unfamiliar with the area , in an emergency situation and without other available information , attempting a landing , ' he said			0
' i have arranged that @entity2 be informed of the error and requested that it be urgently corrected			0

@entity2 is fixing problems as they go along , but users are finding many errors with the app
users may expect some *hiccups* with @entity6 launching tomorrow
the towns of @entity71 and @entity217 appear to be missing
a 35 - acre site near @entity151 called @entity156 is listed as an airport
a search for @entity69 brings up @entity70 - a *football* club for the *over-fives*
many *gig* venues , schools and *community* centres are missing from the map
*blurry* and low - quality satellite views - with large parts of @entity233 , among other places , obscured by cloud .
