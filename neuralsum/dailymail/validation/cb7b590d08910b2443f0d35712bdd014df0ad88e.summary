a professional cleaner who mops up after extreme hoarders has told of the disgusting conditions he comes across almost on a daily basis			1
@entity6 , who runs @entity7 and @entity8 , has shared photographs from inside the houses he cleans up with @entity11			2
the pictures document some of the worst houses in the nation , littered with piles of rubbish , mountains of food scraps and stacks of newspapers covered in faecal matter the company is forced to clean			1
mr @entity6 assesses how dirty a house is on a scale of one to 10			1
homes that fall into the rating one category are those lived in by basic hoarders who collect a lot of things , whereas a rating of 10 means there is so much filth in the house that you can not see the floor , which is often also covered in animal faeces and infestations everywhere			1
for a three - bedroom , one - bathroom home , cleaning up can cost up to $ 20,000 if it scores a rating of 10			2
' it usually would take three technicians two weeks to clean a home that â€™s rated a 10 , ' mr @entity6 told @entity11			1
' a 10 has animal faeces , bug infestations ... [ people are ] just throwing rubbish everywhere , and food scraps get put in a pile			1
in extreme circumstances , employees wear @entity70 suits to protect themselves from hazardous dangerous of their jobs ' i would rather live at the tip than live in some of these houses			0
at least the tip has fresh air			0
' one of the signs mr @entity6 sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step			1
he said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out - of - control homes			0
mr @entity6 said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week			1
he said cleaning up after hoarders was worse than mopping up unattended deaths , where people die of unnatural causes			2
this was the scene of an unattended death where a body was found lying in the middle of rubbish mr @entity6 said most unattended deaths involved hoarders because most were ashamed to let people into their homes category 1 : organised hoarding but clean living category 2 : organised hoarding where regular cleaning should be undertaken more often category 3 : the hoarding has gotten to a point where it is now taking over living space and rubbish is now a problem inside with ants nests , roaches category 4 : in desperate need of sorting and cleaning out junk as valuable items are now mixed in with junk and rubbish category 5 : floor space half of what it should be with 50 per cent of the hoarding area now rubbish piles with some food scraps and mice infestation category 6 : on the way to becoming completely out - of - control with dog / cat urine and faeces now mixed in with the rubbish category 7 : all rubbish and food scraps , with valuable items un-noticible - only a pathway runs through the mess category 8 : same as 7 but now the pathway is also rubbish with no visible floor , several rooms used as rubbish bins category 9 : sleeping on dirty mattress or couch among the rubbish as rooms and kitchen are not accessible , food scraps thrown everywhere , roaches , bed bugs , all kinds of bugs			1
rats / mice and mould with dry - retching smell			0
place looks like a rubbish tip inside with two feet of rubbish in living rooms and higher in other rooms , non-working toilet and no running water category 10 : floor and building structure is compromised from rotting floor , walls , and too hazardous to be cleaned without a building inspection but sadly most unattended deaths involved hoarders who were ' embarrassed or ashamed ' to let people visit their homes			1
' the bodies tend to be on the pile of rubbish			0
the rubbish is completely covered in goop and bodily fluid and faeces and everything that comes out a body			0
cleaners are often met with two feet deep of rubbish along with caked on faecal matter on the floor inside the home of rated 8 , which means rubbish and food scraps , with valuable items un-noticible and litter - covered footpath mr @entity6 's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics this is when a house reaches a level three on mr @entity6 's ratings system , with grime and dirt caked onto the kitchen bench another home with the stove covered in grease and the nearby sink is covered in stubborn filth ' @entity218 often are rotten underneath because of the filth that grows underneath			1
' cats and dogs that live there p * * s and crap everywhere			0
they usually live on the couch because there 's nowhere else for them to go			0
' mr @entity6 's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics			2
most people would think the filth would be the most difficult to deal with but he insists it 's the hoarders who did not want to throw anything out			0
mr @entity6 said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week one of the signs mr @entity6 sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step he said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out - of - control homes this shower has an major mould and limescale problem that has remained uncleaned for a long period of time ' we wo n't clean the property if the owner is present during the clean , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' we tell them to buy a box of stickers and go around and sticker everything with a red or green dot if they want to keep			0
