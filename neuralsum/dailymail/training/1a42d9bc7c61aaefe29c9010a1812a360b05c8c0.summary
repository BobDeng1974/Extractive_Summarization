when @entity1 walk up @entity2 on march 1 , the smart money is on them leaving with the @entity3			1
why ? because @entity4 is the specialist in finals			1
eleven down , nine trophies is among the best records ever to have been accumulated in @entity9 ’s elite			0
you must tip your hat to the @entity13 given he ’s managed it in four different countries , too			0
he is the man for the big occasion			0
to have lost just two finals in his time as a manager is nothing short of remarkable , but the way in which he ’s lifted those trophies gives an insight into just why his record is so impressive			2
@entity4 is in another final after @entity1 beat @entity30 in the @entity3 on tuesday night almost 50 per cent of these finals have gone to extra-time , including his first - ever trophy in the @entity33 against @entity34			1
it points to a boss who is insistent on definitely not losing , with his team invariably coming out on top , indicating their superior fitness levels as well			0
@entity40 take a one - goal lead to @entity42 in the @entity3 semi-final second leg at @entity45 on wednesday night and here , @entity46 documents the frightening record of @entity4 and why @entity48 or @entity49 should n’t fancy their chances a great deal if they reach the final			1
@entity53 ( right ) celebrates after his winner took @entity1 through to a @entity2 final on march 1 2003 – @entity33 ( @entity56 3 - 2 @entity57 ) on a @entity58 night heaped in drama , @entity56 twice blew a lead against @entity61 ’s @entity34 before @entity63 ’s extra-time sending off saw @entity64 clinch a late winner and @entity4 ’s first piece of silverware in @entity69 competition			1
@entity56 players celebrate after beating @entity61 's @entity34 to lift the 2003 @entity33 @entity63 was shown a red card in @entity58 - the moment turned the final the way of @entity4 's side 2003 – @entity76 ( @entity56 1 - 0 @entity77 ) the @entity33 success was to be followed by a triumph in @entity76 ’s main cup competition a month later – @entity4 ’s first domestic trophy of what would become a glittering career			1
@entity84 scored the only goal against @entity77 – the club he ’d left just a year previous			0
@entity87 ( left ) was part of the @entity56 side to also win the @entity76 that same season ... 2004 – @entity76 ( @entity56 1 - 2 @entity91 ) the only major final @entity4 lost in 10 years , @entity56 blew a lead through @entity84 and eventually succumbed to @entity93 in extra-time at the @entity95			1
... but they were to be beaten in the same competition by @entity91 a year later ( @entity98 and @entity99 pictured ) 2004 – @entity100 ( @entity56 3 - 0 @entity101 ) the @entity13 ’s crowning moment as manager of @entity56			0
@entity4 could barely drink in the monumental achievement of winning the @entity100 because his mind was already on other things – namely joining the @entity108 revolution at @entity1			1
they swept @entity101 aside with embarrassing ease ; @entity111 ( no , not that one ) , @entity99 and @entity64 scored the goals			0
@entity56 completed a double by comfortably beating @entity101 in the @entity100 final in 2004 @entity4 was all smiles with @entity116 - a player he would later take with him to @entity1 @entity56 had no problems sweeping aside @entity101 , who were soundly beaten in @entity120 , @entity121 2005 - @entity3 ( @entity1 3 - 2 @entity122 ) the final to be remembered for that @entity126 header through his own net at the @entity128 – months before he turned @entity1 town to stay at @entity30 – was capped off by @entity129 climbing off the bench to net a 112th - minute winner and get the trophy ball rolling for @entity4 at @entity133 in his first season			1
@entity4 consoles @entity126 after his own goal in the @entity3 final of 2005 the manager gestured with a finger to his lips on winning the competition in a bid to silence his critics 2007 – @entity3 ( @entity1 2 - 1 @entity143 ) @entity144 was simply unplayable , scoring twice to beat @entity143			1
the game was remembered for the significant blow @entity147 took to the face thanks to the boot of @entity150			0
@entity151 lifts the @entity3 after @entity1 beat @entity143 2 - 1 at the @entity128 @entity147 had to be taken off on a stretcher after suffering a serious blow to the head from @entity150 @entity144 started his run of scoring important goals in finals against the @entity158 in 2007 2007 – @entity159 ( @entity1 1 - 0 @entity160 ) it was the year of @entity144 , who completed @entity1 ’s historic double with an extra-time winner against @entity160 at @entity2 , poking underneath @entity165			1
the @entity166 were slightly fortunate given @entity167 had appeared to have scored earlier but referee @entity169 ’s assistant adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line			0
@entity144 wheels away after netting an extra-time winner against @entity160 at @entity2 @entity4 laughs with @entity174 ( left ) after lifting his first @entity159 as @entity1 manager 2010 – @entity176 ( @entity177 1 - 0 @entity178 ) success in @entity180 was largely down to the prolific season enjoyed by @entity182 , whose only goal against @entity178 ( in the @entity184 , by the way ) sealed @entity4 ’s first trophy at @entity177			1
the first of three , including @entity187 @entity4 kisses the @entity176 trophy after @entity177 beat @entity178 in their own back yard 2010 – @entity100 ( @entity177 2 - 0 @entity190 ) this was classic @entity4			2
they absorbed a fair amount of pressure against @entity195 ’s @entity190 , @entity182 taking both his chances when they arose and the rest is history			0
as with his exit from @entity56 , a teary @entity4 departed the club after a @entity100 victory			2
@entity4 is surrounded by his players and staff after beating @entity190 in the @entity100 the in - form @entity182 notched twice as @entity177 downed @entity195 's side in 2010 2011 - @entity206 ( @entity207 1 - 0 @entity208 ) now this was sweet			2
in his first season as manager of the biggest club in the world , @entity4 beat arch rivals @entity214 in the @entity206 final thanks to his fellow countryman @entity216			2
interestingly , it was yet another goal coming in extra-time to seal it			0
@entity4 was held aloft after @entity207 beat @entity214 in the 2011 @entity206 final @entity207 players enjoyed a hero 's welcome but dropped the trophy from their bus 2013 – @entity206 ( @entity207 1 - 2 @entity225 ) if 2011 was sweet , this defeat saw mourinho plunge to the depths of despair			2
an extra-time defeat at the hands of their city rivals @entity225 – after @entity216 had put real into a 14th - minute lead , no less			0
it was @entity236 for the boss , who left for his second @entity1 spell soon after .			0

@entity1 are through to the @entity3 final after beating @entity30
they will face either @entity42 or @entity40
@entity4 has an *incredible* record in major finals , winning nine of 11
@entity246 : @entity1 want *revenge* against @entity40 in final
