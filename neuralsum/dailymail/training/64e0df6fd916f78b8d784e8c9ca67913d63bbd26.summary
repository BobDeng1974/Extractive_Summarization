@entity1 , 78 , had just moved home with her husband @entity11 , 79 , who has alzheimer ’s disease , when she ‘ flipped ’ and repeatedly plunged a carving knife into his chest , causing him horrific injuries			1
she looked ‘ totally deranged ’ when her daughter called in by chance after the attack , prosecutors said , and ‘ had a wild look in her eyes and was covered in blood ’			2
police were called , and when mrs @entity1 , who had also begun to cut herself , refused to put the knife down , they tasered her twice			1
mr @entity26 , who used to work for electronics firm @entity27 , survived despite his injuries and is being looked after at a care home			0
he is said to be keen to see his wife			2
mrs @entity1 , who arrived at court using a @entity34 frame , yesterday escaped a jail sentence for the attack after a judge heard that years of caring for her husband had taken their toll on her mental health			1
@entity2 heard how mrs @entity1 cracked after the couple moved to a newly built bungalow in @entity43 , @entity44 , from another property in the market town			1
they had been married for almost 40 years but mr @entity26 ’s memory had deteriorated severely since 2003			1
mrs @entity1 was said to have complained in the weeks leading up to the attack that she had ‘ lost him ’ years before and could n’t ‘ put up with him ’ for much longer			1
after the attack last november , her husband was taken to intensive care in nearby @entity54 with ten stab wounds to his chest as well as injuries to his shoulder , hands and right thigh			1
mrs @entity1 , who suffered minor injuries from the barbs of the taser , told police : ‘ i love him to bits			1
i just flipped my lid			0
you always hurt the one you love and i hurt my husband			2
it was because of the stress			0
the pressure of moving house got to me			0
please , please , i ’m sorry for what i ’ve done			0
i ’m not an evil person			0
’ @entity75 , prosecuting , told the court how on the day of the attack mrs @entity1 ’s daughter from a previous marriage , @entity80 , called in to check that everything was ok			1
she found her mother in a ‘ deranged ’ state and her stepfather lying on the bedroom floor , covered in blood			0
when police arrived , mrs @entity1 ‘ appeared at the doorway still holding the knife ’ and moved towards them , mr @entity75 said			1
she ignored requests to drop it , causing officers to taser her twice before arresting her on suspicion of attempted murder			2
psychiatrists who examined mrs @entity1 agreed she was ill at the time she carried out the attack			1
she pleaded guilty to wounding her husband with intent to cause grievous bodily harm			2
judge @entity100 sentenced mrs @entity1 , who had spent five months on remand , to a two - year community order with supervision by probation officers and imposed an indefinite restraining order which means she can visit her husband only under supervision			1
' unusual and sad case ' : @entity110 crown court judge @entity100 ( pictured ) sentenced @entity1 to a two - year community order with supervision by probation officers he said the case was ‘ highly unusual and extremely sad ’ , adding : ' they had been happily married for 40 years and were devoted to each other			1
‘ in 2003 mr @entity26 began to experience signs of memory loss			0
he eventually contracted dementia and it got progressively worse			0
she was his sole carer			0
‘ caring for anyone with dementia should not be underestimated			0
she found herself under a great strain and contracted a depressive illness			0
' plainly at the time of this incident the balance of her mind was disturbed against a background of great domestic upheaval			0
‘ there are very exceptional cases when justice should be tempered with mercy			0
this is one of them			0
' in almost every case of wounding with intent any defendant who either pleads or is found guilty can expect to receive a sentence measuring in years			2
' for reasons i hope are obvious , i am satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the guidelines in this case			0
’ mrs @entity1 chose to make no comment after the hearing but her lawyer said she was ‘ anxious to see her husband ’ and that he ‘ would like to see her as well ’			1
a neighbour of the retired couple , @entity152 , 42 , said yesterday : ‘ to taser her twice does seem a little bit over the top			2
it does make you wonder what the police would have done 20 years ago or so without these weapons			2
’ but detective inspector @entity162 , of @entity163 , said : ‘ the use of the taser was necessary to prevent mrs @entity1 injuring herself further , to prevent her injuring the attending officers but most critically to allow for immediate medical attention to be rendered to her husband			1
‘ had the officers not acted so quickly , it is possible the injuries to mr @entity26 may have proved fatal			0
