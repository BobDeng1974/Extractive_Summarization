by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:42 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 12 april 2013 embarrassed : @entity3 leader @entity2 has apologised after suggesting raising a flag with a smiley face on it during @entity8 's funeral the @entity10 leader of a city council told his colleagues he would like to fly a flag with a ‘ happy smiling face ’ on it on the day of @entity8 ’s funeral			1
amid a continuing surge of hatred from the @entity18 in response to the former prime minister ’s death , the leader of left - wing @entity3 council @entity2 wrote to his colleagues to ask whether they thought the town hall flag should be lowered to half - mast on the day of the funeral			1
he wrote that personally he would rather ‘ fly a flag with a happy smiling face on ’			1
another @entity10 colleague responded that he ‘ would have preferred to see her hanging from a flag pole ’			2
the messages emerged after one of the politicians mistakenly sent the email thread to all the councillors in the city , including disgusted conservative councillors			0
@entity3 is among several @entity10 - led councils who are refusing to lower the flags on council buildings as a mark of respect during @entity8 ’s funeral on wednesday			2
@entity50 council insisted it was ‘ not a day of national mourning ’ , while @entity52 council said it would not lower its flag as feelings toward @entity8 ’s policies ‘ remain strong and raw ’			0
labour - run @entity59 council and @entity61 council , which both have no conservative councillors , have also refused to carry out the gesture			0
@entity65 council echoed other councils who said that they would not fly flags at half - mast because they had ‘ received no official instruction from the @entity71 ’			0
in the email sent on thursday at 1.57pm , mr @entity2 wrote to his party colleagues : ‘ whilst i have had to smile at some of the jokes doing the rounds following the death of @entity8 , it has been brought to my attention that normally , following the death of a former prime minister , we receive an instruction from the @entity83 telling us to fly the @entity84 at half - mast			1
falling out : @entity10 and the @entity86 have had a row over whether to have a flag at half - mast at @entity90 ( pictured ) ‘ i would like to gauge the views of comrades			2
my own view is that i would fly a flag with a happy smiling face on			1
’ in response , @entity10 councillor @entity96 wrote : ‘ would have preferred to see her hanging from a flag pole in the early 80s ! a definite no from me			1
’ but instead of sending the message just to his ‘ comrades ’ , mr @entity96 accidentally sent the thread to all councillors			2
@entity3 ’s @entity86 leader @entity113 said : ‘ while some did not agree with @entity8 ’s policies , this sort of glee at her death says more about the two councillors concerned than it does about her			0
’ last night mr @entity96 was unrepentant , saying he was ‘ ashamed ’ of @entity8			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ if offence has been caused , to anyone , i very much regret it			0
