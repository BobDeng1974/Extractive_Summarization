locked up : @entity1 @entity0 was imprisoned on murder charges in 1933 and spent 20 years inside a notorious prison a @entity5 - based scientist is seeking a pardon for his late father who spent 20 years imprisoned on infamous @entity9 for a crime he says he did n’t commit			1
@entity12 , who has lived in @entity5 since his teens , said his father @entity15 died in 1990 with a murder conviction still to his name , and wants the @entity19 government to overturn it			1
mr @entity12 was imprisoned in 1933 in a @entity19 penal colony on the notorious island , off the coast of @entity23 , and stayed until the prison was closed in 1953			1
the @entity1 - born man was thrown behind bars alongside his two cousins after he was accused of shooting dead his own boss			1
in fact one of his cousins was guilty of the crime - but mr @entity12 refused to tell the truth because he did n’t want to see one of his own family face the guillotine			1
as a result of his silence he was condemned to incarceration and spent 20 years battling starvation , yellow fever and hard labour before he was freed in 1953 when the @entity19 were forced to close the prison			1
he returned to @entity1 and held a respected position in public office before dying at the age of 83 in 1990			1
his son , aged 58 , has now called for him to be officially pardoned after vowing to prevent his father ’s name going down in history as a convicted killer			2
mr @entity51 , a computer scientists from @entity53 , has provided all the information for a book about his father written by @entity58 crime writer @entity57 called @entity59			2
he said : ' my father did not want to point the finger at his cousin			2
' in those days the @entity19 would have chopped off his cousin ’s head , and my father could not stand that			1
he did not want his cousin guillotined so he kept quiet			0
' my father was an incredible man and he is an inspiration to all of us - he managed to survive the most unimaginably horrific conditions			0
notorious : the dangerous island prison , off the coast of @entity72 , operated until 1953 notorious : mr @entity12 was held on @entity9 , in the @entity73 not far from @entity23 ' not only did he survive , but he kept his dignity , and i am so proud of him for this			1
' but he should never have been convicted in the first place			0
the @entity19 government convicted my father purely because he would not reveal who the real guilty man was			1
' the @entity19 had no proof whatsoever that he was guilty and this is a terrible miscarriage of justice			1
' in honour of my father ’s name , i am now asking that the @entity19 government does the right thing and overturns his conviction , preferably while my mother is still alive			1
' he was innocent , and i want to get the @entity19 people to reconsider			2
' mr @entity12 had the number 51240 tattooed on his arm and survived an horrific transportation on a packed prison ship before arriving on @entity9 off @entity95			1
free man : mr @entity12 left the prison when it was closed in 1953 , but still had the conviction hanging over him @entity19 imprisoned more than 80,000 men there and the odds of survival were massively stacked against them			1
the island prison was the setting for the book @entity105 by @entity107			2
it is , supposedly , a true account of how he and a friend escaped the prison by jumping into the sea holding sacks of coconuts for floatation			0
story : @entity12 , pictured , is now calling on the @entity19 government to overturn the conviction for his father , who died in 1990 mr @entity51 added : ' @entity9 is @entity121			1
it ’s a place where 90 per cent of prisoners died in their first year			0
' they were thrown in the jungle to make roads , and they worked under some incredible conditions			0
if they were n’t killed by yellow fever , they were killed by starvation			0
' there were many ways you could die , and only the very , very strongest survived			0
the reason why he survived is because he was young , and he was sharp			0
' he survived because he was destined to survive			0
i really believe that , because to come back from yellow fever is not easy			0
' mr @entity51 arrived in @entity140 from @entity1 when he was just 17 and began to study computer science in @entity142 , @entity143			1
he married here and had three children before divorcing and moving to @entity58			0
ten years ago @entity57 came to his café in the @entity58 town of @entity148 and snapped up an opportunity to pitch his father ’s story			0
the novel , called @entity59 , will be published on 13 march			0
the notorious prison , just off the coast of @entity95 , held prisoners from 1852 and was not completely closed until 1953			1
political prisoner : @entity157 was held on @entity9 in the late 19th century the 34 - acre island was one of several in the area used for different classes of prisoner			2
@entity9 was for political prisoners			0
the bleak , rocky outcrop is covered in dense jungle			0
more than 80,000 prisoners were sent there , with hardly any successful escapes			0
@entity107 , the author of @entity105 who is sometimes known by that name himself , claimed to have escaped when the waves carried him away as he clung to coconuts for floatation			0
however , the authorities have contradicted his version of events , claiming he was never held on the island , but a mainstream prison			2
one famous prisoner who was certainly held on the island was @entity157 , a @entity180 officer in the @entity19 army who was convicted of treason in 1895			1
he was held on the island in gruelling conditions for more than four years until he was allowed to return home after a public outcry - which centred on the lack of evidence used to convict him			2
@entity157 , who was accused of passing military secrets to @entity191 , was kept in especially bleak conditions			0
as well as the struggles of impossible heat and tropical disease , he was kept in solitary confinement , with his five prison guards forbidden to speak to him			2
his legs were chained and special measures were taken to block his views of the sea and the outside world			0
@entity19 authorities announced plans to close the prisons in 1938 after the depraved conditions were revealed , but the outbreak of the @entity208 , in which @entity95 too fell under @entity210 control , delayed the process severely			2
according to his son 's tale , mr @entity12 would have been held there throughout this time .			1

@entity0 was held on the @entity19 penal colony from 1933 to 1953
he had been convicted of murder along with two cousins
they endured disease and terrible treatment on the @entity23 island
@entity12 , his son says he did not commit the murder
he stayed silent to *protect* his guilty cousin , who would have been killed
mr @entity12 left the prison and went on to hold public office in @entity1
but the conviction was never overturned , which has led to calls from mr @entity12 's son for the @entity19 government to issue a pardon
