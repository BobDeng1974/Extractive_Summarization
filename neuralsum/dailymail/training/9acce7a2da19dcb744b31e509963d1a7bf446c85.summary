a host of new changes are being made by @entity3 administrators in an effort to show that the school is moving past the trial of former assistant coach @entity7 where he was sentenced to jail for abusing multiple boys both in and out of the football team 's showers			1
loyal fans may still carry out the tradition of dressing in white for games and coming early to the school 's @entity16 to cheer on the team , but they wo n't find themselves screaming the lyrics to @entity20 's hit @entity21 as they have for many seasons past			1
given some of the song 's provocative lyrics - which include ' touching me , touching you ' - athletic officials decided to keep it off the pep band 's playlist for the upcoming season			2
local paper @entity55 reported the playlist update as the school released the details about changes fans can expect when they attend games this coming season			2
@entity34 has been played regularly at the team 's home games for years , and @entity3 was not alone as the song is also favored by the @entity67 , the @entity68 , and @entity69			2
@entity20 's hit , which has an unusual story behind it as it was inspired by a picture he saw of president @entity76 's daughter @entity75 when she was 11 - years - old , is not the only one that devoted fans will miss this season			1
@entity79 reports that the 1972 hit @entity80 , part two will not be played either , as it was made famous by @entity83 singer @entity82			1
@entity82 was arrested in the late 1990s for possession of child pornography and committing obscene acts with minors in @entity88 a decade later			1
in addition to musical changes , an updated roster , new coaching staff and alternative pre-game strategy will also greet the fans that turn up to see how the team fares after they were given extensive @entity98 penalties			0
change : @entity3 's new head coach @entity99 , right , said he 's looking to make a few changes to usher in the team 's ' new era ' that could include a uniform shake up			0
the iconic outfit is seen on @entity105 , left , scandal : the announcement comes after @entity3 opted to remove a statue of once storied and now shamed former head coach @entity109 and the ex-assistant coach @entity7 's guilty verdicts the so - called @entity112 have been banned by the governing authority from making it to any bowl games for the next four years , have been ordered to pay a $ 60million fine , and had all of @entity109 's wins stripped from their record dating back the 1998 when @entity7 was originally investigated internally over one instance of sex abuse			1
the team will be lead onto the field by new coach @entity99 , who formerly worked for the @entity123 , and they will be sporting their names on the backs of their jerseys for the first time ever - a move which the coach hopes will help show they are in a ' new era '			0
' we 've got a group of young men there , like i said , that are sticking together			0
and there 's changes that have taken place at @entity3 over the last six months that are reflected already , ' he said in a press conference late last month			0
for years , @entity20 kept quiet about what inspired his 1969 single , but he decided to break his silence in 2007			2
he said that when he was struggling musician , he saw a picture of then - first daughter @entity45 taking a stroll on her horse			1
at the time , she was 11 - years - old			1
' it was a picture of a little girl dressed to the nines in her riding gear , next to her pony			0
it was such an innocent , wonderful picture , i immediately felt there was a song in there , ' he previously said			0
in spite of his assertions , some lyrics are slightly unseemly given the age of the inspiration			0
aside from the ' hands , touching hands , reaching out , touching me , touching you ' portion of the song which @entity3 officials took issue with , another portion could also be considered objectionable			0
later in the song , he sings ' look at the night / and it do n't seem so lonely / we fill it up with only two '			0
it was only in 2007 , when he sang the hit via video stream at ms @entity45 's 50th birthday that he revealed the former first daughter as the inspiration			1
' innocent ' : though this picture was taken when @entity75 was only five years old , it shows her ( right ) with her pet pony @entity192 , and then - president father @entity76 ( left ) and young brother @entity194 outside of the @entity195 watch the video here			2
