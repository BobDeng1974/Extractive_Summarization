a large splinter meant an injury to an employee 's hand - and a £ 500 bill for the council @entity64 , political director of the @entity65 , said : ' the bill to taxpayers for compensation claims has got unacceptably high			1
' while some staff might have legitimate claims because of negligence , there has been a worrying rise in the compensation culture across local government			0
' taxpayers should not be footing the bill for cases where a bit of common sense would have avoided an accident and there has to be a degree of personal responsibility			0
' accidents do happen , and council staff should not see an accident as an excuse to fleece the rest of us out of our hard - earned cash			0
' it is therefore important that councils should fight any questionable claims to protect taxpayers ' money from being abused			0
' a spokesperson from @entity8 said : ' the welfare of our staff is a top priority but with over 15,000 employees , unfortunately accidents can occasionally happen			2
' we follow health and safety policies and ensure staff carry out their activities and maintain their premises in ways that minimise the risk of accidents occurring			0
' we also have appropriate procedures in place if things do go wrong , to ensure any lessons are learned and that we can continue to maintain excellent standards of safety			0
