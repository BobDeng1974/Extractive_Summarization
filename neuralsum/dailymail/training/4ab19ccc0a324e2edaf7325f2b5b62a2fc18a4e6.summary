@entity86 state senator @entity90 briefly caught national attention last month by staging a filibuster to stall the restrictions , although her gambit ultimately failed			0

fighting for their rights : abortion rights supporters demonstrate outside the @entity23 in @entity12 , @entity2 , where gov. @entity1 signed the abortion restriction bill the @entity2 measures are also more far reaching than a ban passed by the @entity106 in 2003 on a type of late - term abortion called ' partial birth ' , which covered only a small fraction of abortions performed each year			1

@entity2 already has a law passed two years ago requiring a woman to undergo an ultrasound and be shown the results , before an abortion can be performed			1

the abortion rights activists vowed to immediately challenge the @entity2 law in court			1
