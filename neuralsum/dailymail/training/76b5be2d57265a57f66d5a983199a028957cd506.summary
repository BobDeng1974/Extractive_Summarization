by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 18:07 est , 25 december 2012 if there were ever any doubts that showing off is in @entity4 the dancing dog ’s blood , this family picture should dispel them			0
the @entity10 ’s @entity9 star has been enjoying some well - deserved time off with his brothers @entity13 and @entity14 , and sisters @entity15 and @entity17			1
the litter of six were all back together for the first time since puppyhood at a party to celebrate @entity22 and their forthcoming seventh birthday which is on friday			1
@entity26 quality : @entity10 's @entity9 star @entity4 was joined by his siblings , from left , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity4 , @entity13 , @entity28 and @entity17 reunited : the litter of six were together for the first time since puppyhood and also celebrated their forthcoming birthday on december 28 most of them were happy to pose in festive headgear – with one notable exception			1
@entity17 ’s owner @entity36 had to use all her powers of persuasion – and some out - and - out bribery – to get her pet in the line - up			1
the problem was that @entity17 ’s @entity44 hat was too big and kept falling over her eyes			2
finally a smaller substitute was found , along with a few tasty doggy treats , and @entity17 completed the sextet			2
@entity4 , who has been performing with his owner @entity4 in the @entity50 pantomime at @entity51 , @entity52 , took a break from his hectic schedule to spend some time with his very different siblings , who came from all over the country to see him at his digs in @entity58			1
@entity4 , 17 , said : ‘ @entity4 does n’t really get time to spend with other dogs so it is nice for him to have fun with his brothers and sisters			0
say cheese : owners @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 call the dogs to look forward for the picture at the reunion reluctant diva : @entity17 's owner @entity74 tried a variety of @entity44 hats on her pet - who remained distinctly unimpressed by the whole affair they see each other at dog shows but this is the first time we ’ve been able to get them all in one place at the same time since they were born			1
’ as with most family reunions , sibling rivalry inevitably came into play with the animals trying to outdo each other with their dancing tricks			0
‘ they do normally get on , but i think they ’re just quite excited , ’ @entity4 explained			0
@entity4 and @entity4 shot to fame after becoming the first dog act to win @entity10 ’s @entity9 in may			1
now a household name , @entity4 has performed in front of the @entity100 as a part of the @entity103 celebrations and even has his own book – @entity4 : my @entity105			0
big stuff : @entity100 greets @entity4 and @entity4 after the @entity108 at the @entity109 in @entity110 progress : @entity4 pictured with his litter as a pud , left , and with owner @entity4 , right and it would appear that his star quality runs right through the family			0
all the dogs , which are a mixture of border collie , @entity120 and @entity121 , have appeared in calendars or taken part in agility shows and @entity125 , the @entity127 ’s contest for crossbreeds			0
@entity14 ’s owner @entity129 , who travelled to the reunion from @entity131 , said : ‘ they all love performing and standing up on their hind legs , and they are not exactly strangers to diva - ish behaviour			2
it is obvious they are all related ! ’ @entity4 : my @entity105 is out now priced £ 9.99 .			0
