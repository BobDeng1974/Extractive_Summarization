@entity0 feels referees are giving @entity2 a raw deal because they see his side as a soft target			1
@entity2 have had @entity6 and @entity7 sent off in their last two @entity9 matches and manager @entity0 admits he has been left bemused by what he sees as refereeing inconsistencies in games involving his team this season			1
@entity0 says he has studied every single @entity2 game on tape and expressed his concerns at an hour - long meeting he had with officials at the @entity21 this week - but insists he wo n't stop drumming a fair play philosophy into his players even if it hurts them on the pitch			1
@entity2 have had @entity6 and @entity7 sent off in their last two @entity9 matches ' i just feel at this moment in time it is far too easy to book a @entity2 player , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity30 's visit to south @entity31 on saturday			1
' i have analysed every single foul we have committed this season and every foul against us , and in terms of the consistency level it does not add up			2
' we are getting punished for everything but some teams come here and they commit five or six fouls straight away			2
' their plan is to be physical and that is the whole game plan , and when we stand up for ourselves we get punished for it			2
' i do n't know why it is , we try to play good football while other teams think the best way to stop that is to be physical and get in our faces			0
' maybe we are too much of an easy target			0
' @entity2 boss @entity0 feels his side are being harshly punished by referees @entity0 revealed current @entity9 referee @entity53 , former official @entity54 and @entity55 , of the @entity56 , visited @entity2 this week to discuss refereeing issues and hear his concerns			1
ironically , @entity53 was in charge of @entity2 's goalless draw at @entity61 last weekend when @entity7 was sent off for two bookable offences , @entity63 being particularly unhappy with the nature of the second yellow card when he was adjudged to have obstructed @entity61 winger @entity66			1
' if you look at @entity7 's second booking , what do you want him to do ? ' @entity0 asked			1
' he can not disappear , and in the lead up to his first one there was a foul against us that was not given			0
' those decisions go more against us than for us			0
' @entity0 also said he was exasperated by @entity61 striker @entity76 constantly going to ground at the @entity77 and questioned why @entity53 kept awarding him free - kicks in such circumstances			1
he promised that @entity2 players would be fined if they did the same thing , saying winning that way would give him no satisfaction whatsoever			1
@entity53 was among the officials who visited the @entity21 this week ' i talked to them about @entity76 's performance at @entity61 , ' @entity0 said of his meeting with the officials			1
' he had the ball played up to him 13 times and on nine of those occasions he was on the floor			0
he is 6ft 3ins and about 14 - 15 stone , the same weight as @entity6			1
' but do @entity6 and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) go on the floor ? no , because we promote for them to stay on the feet			2
' i clocked what @entity76 was doing straight away and i said to the linesman in front of me ' you watch the next time the ball gets played to him , he 'll be on the floor			0
' he did go to ground , so what does that tell you ? that he is going to get the decision if he goes on the floor , and that is hard to take because you run the risk of yellow and red cards			0
@entity0 was particularly exasperated by @entity61 striker @entity76 constantly going to ground ' but i have said to the players if we are going to win we will win properly because you will get more satisfaction out of it			2
' that will be the way i want to do it , but i understand the players must feel the reward on saturday			0
' i do n't believe in players going to ground if they have not been touched , if that were to happen i would deal with it afterwards			0
' @entity0 said @entity53 told him @entity132 manager @entity131 spoke to the @entity56 about the difference between perceived big clubs and small clubs			1
' referees have a tough job and i am sure it is not intentional , but at this moment in time we seem to get punished for everything , ' @entity0 said			2
' i am not saying we do not make fouls that are yellow cards , but overall it looks too easy to punish us			0
' we showed them examples and they could see clearly what i was talking about			0
' it is so unjust and the way we play means we need more protection			0
