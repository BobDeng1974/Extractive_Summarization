@entity0 , whose stint as a @entity3 quarterback briefly sparked ' tebow - mania ' , spent monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the @entity7			1
but after one day of training , @entity0 left without being signed , according to @entity10 @entity3 insider @entity9			1
the 27 - year - old who once played for the @entity13 and @entity14 performed for the @entity7 and coach @entity15 in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position , a source told @entity18 @entity0 , pictured in august 20123 , trained with the @entity7 on monday in an attempt to try out for a quarterback position considering all the offseason moves made by @entity15 , taking a look at the 2007 @entity24 winner with the huge following should n't be a surprise			1
it has been speculated that @entity0 could run zone - read plays better than @entity30 's four current quarterbacks			2
@entity0 elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field , a head - bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as ' @entity39 ' in the wake of his success			1
in 2011 , @entity0 began the season as a backup with the @entity13 but was given a chance to start after a 1 - 4 start			2
@entity0 sparked a string of come - from - behind victories and led @entity13 into the playoffs and an upset of @entity51 in the first round			2
but @entity0 's 47 - per cent pass - completion rate was the worst in the @entity3 that season and when the @entity13 signed @entity55 in 2012 , @entity0 became expendable			1
he was sent to the @entity14 in a trade			2
@entity0 was seldom used even as @entity14 starter @entity57 struggled			1
he was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season in @entity61			0
the @entity62 made @entity0 one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no @entity3 team wanted him			1
@entity0 , pictured here in august 2013 , left training on monday without signing with the @entity7			1
but @entity10 @entity3 insider @entity9 left the idea open , claiming ' we 'll see if anything changes ' @entity0 was being assessed by an @entity7 team that features @entity57 , who joined @entity30 after his own departure from the @entity14 , and @entity74 , a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament			1
@entity74 was the second sophomore player to win the @entity24 as the top college player , doing so in 2008			0
@entity0 had been the first in 2007			0
@entity0 has an 8 - 6 record as an @entity3 starting quarterback with a career 48 - per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions			2
@entity9 announced on @entity85 that the @entity7 decided not to sign @entity0 , but left the option open			0
' @entity0 has come and gone from @entity30			0
@entity87 is not planning to sign him at this time			0
we 'll see if anything changes , ' he wrote			0
@entity15 's remake of the @entity7 ' roster has included trading star running back @entity93 to @entity94 , then signing @entity96 @entity95 to replace him			0
clearly , @entity15 - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades			0
although @entity0 had some success in @entity13 , his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the @entity3			1
his strength has been running the ball or improvising			0
there 's also been some thought that @entity0 might switch to tight end or fullback , although he has balked at such a move in the past			2
the @entity7 have depth at tight end , but no fullbacks on the roster .			0

@entity0 spent one day of training with team before leaving
he last played an @entity3 game in 2013 with the @entity14
since then he 's been a college *football* commentator on @entity121
@entity0 won millions of fans for his public displays of his @entity126 faith on and off the field
his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence plagued him in @entity3
