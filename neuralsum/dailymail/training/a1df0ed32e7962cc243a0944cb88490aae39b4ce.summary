by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 07:41 est , 3 january 2014 finance experts , academics and business leaders have raised fears that independence would destroy the economy , hit investment and force companies to migrate to @entity10			1

another said there would be ' utter panic ' among finance firms and several warned of a ' disaster ' for @entity22			1
setback : the vision of independence set out by @entity36 and @entity37 risks the @entity22 economy and would see businesses flee to @entity10 , experts warn @entity36 's separatist vision was dismissed as ' economically incoherent ' ; there were warnings that ' skilled labour ' would leave ; and creating a new border would cut gross domestic product ( gdp ) by as much as 3 per cent			1
the findings are particularly humiliating for deputy first minister @entity37 , who yesterday predicted the economy would be the key battleground in the referendum campaign			0

former chancellor @entity69 , who is leading the @entity70 campaign , said the findings prove that the ' risks involved in leaving the @entity63 are massive '			0

referendum : voters in @entity22 will have their saying on leaving the @entity63 this autumn farmers are overwhelmingly set to reject independence , according to a survey			1
@entity22 @entity87 mep @entity86 received 2,000 replies to a study he conducted , with 72 per cent of respondents supporting the @entity91			1
three - quarters of farmers expressed concern about the impact separation could have on @entity96 agricultural subsidies			0
four - fifths said uncertainty over currency would harm their businesses , while 72 per cent feared separation would make it difficult to sell produce in the rest of the @entity63			2
mr @entity86 said : ' everyone wants to see a thriving @entity22 rural economy , but if you look at the real positives we get from the @entity63 market , from our place in @entity25 and our trade links overseas , our farmers can achieve more as part of the @entity63 family			1
' @entity22 's place in the @entity96 is not only vital for farmers , but also for jobs and growth			1
' but rural affairs secretary @entity120 has claimed farmers would have been handed an extra £ 1billion in @entity25 subsidies if @entity22 were separate			1
@entity122 of @entity124 finance giant @entity123 launched a stinging attack on the @entity13 vision			0
' higher taxes on income would push many wealthy individuals and some companies they work for @entity131 , harming @entity22 's economy , ' he said			1
' a fate similar to the secular stagnation in productivity seen in parts of @entity25 's socialist south may await			1
' @entity138 of the @entity140 think - tank was similarly dismissive , saying : ' the raft of economically incoherent policies being proposed by @entity36 would be disastrous for @entity22			2
' @entity143 of @entity144 described a @entity15 vote as an ' unmitigated disaster for @entity76 ' as did @entity147 , chief economist at @entity148			0
one of the main results of an @entity13 victory in the referendum would be the loss of companies - and jobs - to @entity10 , several experts said			0
@entity156 , chief economist of asset management firm @entity158 , commented : ' when combined with the considerable uncertainty over whether @entity22 can remain in the @entity96 , @entity22 business would start to head south			2
' @entity161 , chief @entity25 financial economist with investment firm @entity162 , said : ' @entity22 is likely to see an ongoing loss of business as it migrates south of the @entity166			1
' @entity167 of the @entity168 warned : ' if there were a @entity15 vote there would be utter panic - with the @entity22 fund managers heading for the @entity166 in droves			1
' @entity175 of @entity177 bank said : ' the flow of direct and portfolio investment , as well as some bank deposits , @entity181 would provide @entity22 with a nasty negative monetary shock			2
' many of those taking part in the survey said uncertainty would devastate the economy			0
@entity190 of banking giant @entity189 said : ' i think the uncertainty will be damaging for everyone ... it is going to make a lot of foreign companies think twice about investing in the @entity63			0
' @entity196 of @entity197 warned of ' increased uncertainty for businesses and markets '			2
@entity201 of @entity204 banker @entity202 said : ' it would create major uncertainty about the viability of the country as an economic unit			2
' @entity211 of @entity212 in @entity213 warned that independence ' is the introduction of a new border			0
that is likely to reduce @entity22 gdp by 3 per cent , and @entity219 by 1 per cent '			2
@entity69 , leading the @entity70 campaign against independence , said the findings prove that the ' risks involved in leaving the @entity63 are massive ' an independent @entity22 's reliance on oil was also highlighted , with @entity225 of financier @entity226 predicting ' overall it will be on a slow growth path '			1
but despite the strong warnings @entity230 said yesterday : ‘ i firmly believe who wins the economic argument will win the referendum			0
‘ @entity22 can more than afford to be independent , something that even the no campaign agrees with			2
we need the powers over the economy to get faster and more sustainable growth into the economy for the long term			0
’ a spokesman for @entity76 added : ‘ the greatest uncertainty for business as well as the country as a whole stems from a ‘ no ’ vote			0
with ‘ yes ’ , we can tailor policies to suit our own needs and priorities , thereby encouraging growth and increasing employment			0
