on the move : a shipping company has moved its headquarters closer to work - by building a new £ 3.5 million floating office change : @entity5 company @entity4 moved 400 metres from their old head office to sit alongside their fleet in @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity5 at just 162ft long , the headquarters is less than half the size of the firm 's powerful ships			1
@entity21 said it needed to have its management team and ground personnel as close as possible to its ships			0
the office was constructed in a nearby shipyard before being towed into place by sea			1
connected to the same pier by bridge - like gangplanks , it now allows their seaman and management team to go from office to ship in seconds			2
new look : however , the new office has a slightly different look to their giant ships , which includes two huge 343ft ice - breaking vessels downsized : at just 162ft long , the headquarters is less than half the size of the firm 's powerful ships @entity47 , @entity49 's @entity48 , said : ' our office was located quite far from the vessels so we had to think through several options			2
' we thought about renting office space near the icebreakers , new office on the ground and an old ship converted into office space			0
' then somebody suggested that if we can build world class icebreakers why ca n't we build a simple floating office			0
' in the end it was economically more efficient than renting office space nearby			2
' ease : the company said it needed to have its management team and ground personnel as close as possible to its ships all in day 's work : the floating offices windows provide a view of the sea floating office : the office was constructed in a nearby shipyard before being towed into place by sea efficient : connected to the same pier by bridge - like gangplanks , it now allows their seaman and management team to go from office to ship in seconds during the cold winter months , the company 's main priority is to make sure maritime traffic to and from @entity5 ports run without delays			1
it means they are responsible for breaking up ice for chartered ships to safely navigate through while also responding to oil spills			0
however , during the summer , their multipurpose ships operate mainly in @entity101 waters to ensure safe operations in offshore oil and gas fields			0
mr @entity47 said : ' @entity104 is in the heart of @entity9 so it 's a very challenging place to get permission to build anything new			1
' so we invited the residents and neighbours to hear about the plan before we said anything in public			0
' residents and the @entity116 were very supportive and they are happy with the outcome now the office is ready			0
