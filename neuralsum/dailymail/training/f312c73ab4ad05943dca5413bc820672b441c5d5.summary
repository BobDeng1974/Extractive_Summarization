by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 02:52 est , 15 february 2013 sir @entity1 : the former prime minister has urged @entity3 to keep quiet sir @entity1 warned ‘ irreconcilable ’ @entity3 to keep quiet today as he warned they are undermining @entity8 ’s attempts to claw back powers from @entity10 ahead of an in / out referendum on @entity14 ’s @entity13 former prime minister described mr @entity8 ’s decision to promise a referendum in 2017 as a ‘ gamble ’ that could lead to @entity14 ’s exit from @entity19 and warned the issue had ‘ come close to destroying the @entity20 ’ in the @entity21 for the prime minister to appoint a cabinet minister as his ‘ lead negotiator ’ ahead of the referendum , even if it means overruling the @entity26 , sir @entity1 was scathing about @entity28 rebel @entity4 said those who believed it was ‘ helpful ’ for the prime minister to receive unsolicited advice about which powers should be repatriated , since it demonstrates to other @entity13 colleagues the strength of feeling in @entity14 , were ‘ quite wrong ’			1
‘ such advice , given publicly , will undermine the prime minister ’s negotiating position			2
he will be seen to be acting under political duress , rather than principle and conviction - and his hand will be weakened , ’ sir @entity1 said.in a reference to his own battles with those he infamously described as @entity28 ‘ bastards ’ , the former prime minister added : ‘ i know that because i have been there ’			1
speaking at the @entity48 foreign policy think tank in @entity49 , sir @entity1 , making a rare intervention into contemporary politics , made a powerful case for @entity14 staying in the @entity13 having renegotiated a looser , more trade - based relationship with @entity54 said that on principle , he was not in favour of referendums in a parliamentary democracy - but suggested mr @entity8 had had no option but to promise one on @entity13 membership after the next election			1
the prime minister delighted @entity20 mps last month when he said that if re-elected , he would seek to renegotiate @entity14 ’s membership of the @entity13 and then offer voters the first decision on membership since we entered the @entity68 in 1975			1
‘ this referendum could heal many old sores and have a cleansing effect on politics			1
it will be healthy to let the electorate re-endorse our membership , or pull us out altogether , ’ sir @entity1 said			1
‘ at present , we are drifting towards - and possibly through - the @entity19 exit			2
we need a renegotiation – and a @entity85 endorsement of it			2
if this is denied , the clamour for it will only grow			2
‘ but it is a gamble – for the @entity88 and for the @entity20			1
the relationship with @entity19 has poisoned @entity14 politics for too long , distracted @entity78 from other issues , and come close to destroying the @entity20			2
it is time to resolve the matter			2
’ ' @entity89 ' : sir @entity1 has said @entity8 's decision to promise a referendum in 2017 could lead to @entity14 's exit from @entity19 sir @entity1 , who faced a damaging revolt from @entity94 over his decision to sign the @entity96 in the early 1990s , urged today ’s rebels to give the prime minister space to renegotiate @entity14 ’s relationship			1
‘ we need to prepare our own proposals without delay , and negotiate courteously and with understanding , ’ he said			0
‘ this manner in which these negotiations are conducted is vital			0
‘ if we enter them with the aggressive attitude of “ give us our way or we quit ” , we will fail			0
’ sir @entity1 said some polls suggested that currently , voters might vote to leave the @entity13 , and said it would not be ‘ easy ’ to negotiate a better deal that would satisfy people			1
sir @entity1 warned that ‘ rebellion is addictive ’ for some @entity20 ‘ irreconcilables ’ who were so obsessed with leaving the @entity13 that they were prepared to ‘ bring down any prime minister ’			1
‘ members with conservative heads and @entity122 hearts can not be placated , ’ he said			0
‘ whatever is offered to them will be insufficient			0
they will only be satisfied by withdrawal			0
‘ the prime minister should be prepared for the likelihood that the irreconcilable among his parliamentarians , including ministers , will campaign for a @entity14 withdrawal			0
’ defiant : sir @entity1 urged mr @entity8 to begin renegotiation talks soon the former prime minister urged mr @entity8 to defy @entity26 objections and to begin renegotiation talks soon			1
‘ i believe he should appoint a lead negotiator who sits in the @entity138			0
if the @entity26 oppose such an appointment – which is possible , since they oppose the referendum – then the prime minister should overrule them			1
on a matter of this importance , the tail must not wag the dog			0
’ sir @entity1 said he did not have a ‘ shred of doubt ’ that @entity14 interests were best served by remaining inside the @entity13			1
‘ the tens of thousands of @entity14 companies who trade with the @entity151 should think long and hard about the consequences of exit			0
so should their employees , numbered in millions			0
to leave , would be a jump into a void , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be a brave decision for @entity14 to go it alone			1
i bow to no - one in my pride of our country , but we should see ourselves as others see us			0
‘ we are 70 million in a world of 7 billion , with nations like @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 all rising in economic and political importance			0
do we wish to become less relevant in their eyes , or face the future as a leading voice in a block of 500 million people ? to leave would be to march against history			0
” ‘ many who wish us to withdraw from @entity19 do so on the assumption that we could enhance our relationship with existing allies : most obviously , the @entity187 and the @entity188			0
’ @entity122 leader @entity182 said : ‘ the very fact that @entity190 are calling out retired pms to back up their leader shows just how weak @entity8 is			2
‘ @entity1 ’s speech simply corroborates the fact that @entity122 are the only party who want to get @entity14 out of the @entity13			1
the @entity190 can scaremonger or try to charm people back all they like - the @entity14 voters are more discerning than that			2

@entity133 's decision to promise a referendum is a ' gamble ' , says sir @entity1
says *eurosceptics* undermining efforts to claw powers back from @entity10
