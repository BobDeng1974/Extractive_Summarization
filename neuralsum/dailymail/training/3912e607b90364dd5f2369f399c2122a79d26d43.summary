her tenth holiday in a year : @entity2 in @entity3 yesterday when @entity5 and @entity2 bulldozed a 1930s mansion and replaced it with a sprawling £ 5million neo-georgian palace , locals accused them of wrecking their affluent corner of @entity11			1
now , however , the boot is on the other foot – after mrs @entity2 complained over plans to build 15 homes near the pair ’s 20 - acre estate			1
in a letter to @entity19 , @entity2 , 28 , warns : ‘ let ’s not ruin our village			1
the development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land			2
' the development will mean more car journeys into the village , which is already congested and unsuitable for the increased traffic			2
it will damage the special landscape , character and appearance of the area			0
’ the plans would see 15 homes built on @entity39 land owned by @entity40 , including five ' affordable ' homes , with one of the builds visible from the end of her drive			1
she also wrote : ' there is no evidence of very special circumstances required to override the harm to the @entity39 – the absence of a 5 year housing land supply in @entity53 does not constitute very special circumstances			1
' mrs @entity2 added that she also had concerns over ' highway safety ' because of poor visibility along the proposed estate 's main access road			1
mrs @entity79 wrote : ' i can see no ' very special circumstances ' that would be the only way to justify the destruction of this green belt area for the purpose of building any number of new houses			2
@entity88 is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting			2
' however not everyone is on mrs @entity2 's side			1
one resident of the affluent neighbourhood said : ' it 's a bit rich coming from her her			0
' when she and @entity5 moved here she bought a very attractive house and then knocked it down and replaced it with a monstrosity and put huge gates round it			0
it looks like they 're living in a prison			0
' @entity2 , pictured on another holiday in @entity3 , where she and @entity5 own a second home , objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would ' ruin ' her village planning chiefs will make a decision on the application next month , but @entity113 , representing @entity40 , held little hope of the plans being given the green light			1
he said : ' i think it 's likely that the application will be rejected			0
there have been 50 or 60 objections to it			0
' mrs @entity2 's home is nearby but she can not quite see our site			1
' from what i understand her site is quite large			0
there was some upset when she had building work done too , but that was a completely different scenario			0
' such comments were unlikely to have troubled @entity2 yesterday – she was enjoying her tenth holiday of the past year , this time at the couple ’s £ 5 million villa in @entity3 where she often takes her sons @entity136 , four , and one - year - old @entity137			2
@entity5 , meanwhile , is still at home while serving a three match suspension from playing for @entity75			0
@entity140 and @entity75 captain @entity141 is yet to join the debate on the controversial plans			0

@entity2 has *slammed* plans to build 15 homes next to her mansion
mrs @entity2 wrote an angry letter to @entity19 about the plans
she said the new builds on @entity39 land would ' ruin ' @entity88 village
one of the 15 homes would be visible from the end of the @entity2 's drive
neighbours including @entity77 's wife have backed up her complaint
