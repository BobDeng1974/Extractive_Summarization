by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 24 june 2013 a spate of unusual weather which has seen snow , sun and thunderstorms hit within days of each other has been put down to the jet stream ' wobbling like a drunk driver '			1
the jet stream , a river of air high above @entity12 that generally dictates the weather , usually rushes rapidly from west to east in a mostly straight direction			1
but lately it seems to have been knocked off course , wreaking havoc across @entity17 as it goes			1

the odd meanderings kicked off in may with upside - down weather , including early @entity23 wildfires fueled by heat meanwhile rhododendrons at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 are covered in snow after an early may snowfall and in @entity35 , @entity31 a bolt of lightning from storm clouds moves over fields and farmland			0

meanwhile , in @entity27 , @entity28 , neighbourhoods were covered in almost a foot of snow after an early may snowfall			0
people swim and sunbathe at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			0
@entity52 's largest city and other parts of the state are experiencing a long stretch of higher than normal temperatures thanks to the jet stream ' wreaking havoc ' across the @entity60 @entity61 was the hottest spot in the nation one day , and @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity64 were warmer than @entity67 and @entity68			1
jet streams are belts of fast flowing , narrow air currents found in the atmosphere , formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures			0
they are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes			0
the northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of @entity17 , @entity81 , and @entity82			2
the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles @entity84 all year round			0
one of the main factors in unsettled weather is a change in the position of the jet stream , which can cause massive changes in weather conditions across the globe			1
the meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss			2
the warming of the @entity96 affects the jet stream by slowing its west - to - east winds and by promoting larger north - south meanders in the flow			1
the most recent example is mid-june where some towns in @entity52 hit record highs			0

the polar jet stream , which is the most northerly jet stream , affects the @entity114 , and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer			2
recently , the jet stream has been further south - which is why the @entity114 has experienced such wet summers			2
in @entity17 the meandering jet stream path has been attributed to arctic ice loss			1
the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) explained : ' enhanced warming of the @entity96 affects the jet stream by slowing its west - to - east winds and by promoting larger north - south meanders in the flow			1
' predicting those meanders and where the weather associated with them will be located in any given year , however , remains a challenge			0
' they researchers claim that there will be more extreme weather events , such as heavy snowfall , heat waves , and flooding in @entity17 and @entity81 but these will vary in location , intensity , and timescales .			2
