chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium , according to a study that found amazing comparisons between obese people and drug addicts			1
in the study , a natural brain chemical called enkephalin - an endorphin with similar properties to opium - surged as rats began to eat @entity20 chocolates			1
addictive : chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium , according to a study that found comparisons between obese people and drug addicts when a drug was used to stimulate the dorsal neostriatum - the brain area releasing the chemical - the number of @entity20 eaten more than doubled			1
in the brain , enkephalin binds to molecular ‘ receptors ’ sensitive to opiate chemicals to reduce pain and produce pleasurable feelings			2
previous research mostly linked the dorsal neostriatum to movement , and recent work suggested it also plays a role in reward - driven behaviour			0
but study leader dr @entity44 said the extraordinary findings showed comparisons between and drug addicts and the obese			2
opium links : the researchers looked at the same brain area which is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes she said : ‘ this ( study ) means that the brain has more extensive systems to make individuals over-consume rewards than previously thought			1
' the same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes ' dr @entity44 ‘ the same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes			2
‘ it seems likely that our enkephalin findings in rats mean that this neurotransmitter may drive some forms of overconsumption and addiction in people			0
’ the findings of the @entity77 researcher and her team have been published in the @entity80 journal @entity81			0
in their paper , the scientists concluded : ‘ opioid circuitry ... could in this way participate in normal motivations and perhaps even in generating intense pathological levels of motivation to overconsume reward in binge eating disorders , drug addiction and related compulsive pursuits			0

study looked at natural brain chemical of enkephalin
it *'s* an endorphin with similar properties to opium
@entity80 researchers found it surged as rats ate @entity20
drug then stimulated brain area releasing chemical
after that , number of @entity20 eaten more than doubled
