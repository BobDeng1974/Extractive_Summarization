@entity5 was shot on july 22 as he tried to *pay* in cheques at the bank
one bullet hit the 32 - year - old 's waist and another lodged **1mm** from his heart
doctors immediately removed the one in his waist , but feared operating on the second bullet would risk the newly married man 's life
eventually doctors at the @entity35 in @entity37 agreed to take on his case
a team of five surgeons successfully removed the bullet on september 23
the bullet was a **1mm** from puncturing the left chamber of his heart
every time his heart beat there was the *potential* for it to kill him
