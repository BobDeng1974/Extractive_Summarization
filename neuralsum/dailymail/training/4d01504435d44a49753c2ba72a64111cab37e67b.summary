by @entity0 the discovery of @entity3 ’s tomb almost a century ago threw up some serious questions and mysteries surrounding the young pharoah ’s burial			1
among the most bizarre rituals found in the tomb was that the king ’s penis was embalmed at a 90 - degree angle – the only mummy to have ever been found with this feature			1
egyptologists from the @entity16 have now claimed that this may have been carried out on purpose to make the king appear like @entity20 , the god of the underworld , in an attempt to frighten religious revolutionaries			1
during the pharoah 's mummification his penis was embalmed at a 90 - degree angle , his body was covered in black liquid and his heart was removed			1
researchers believe these rituals were carried out to make the king look like @entity20 , the god of the underworld researchers from the @entity16 in @entity38 believe the appendage was embalmed at a 90 - degree angle to make the young pharaoh appear as @entity20 , the god of the underworld			1
the angling of the penis was a feature worn by ' corn - mummies ' that were created in honour of @entity20			2
the mummy was also covered in black liquid to resemble @entity20 ' skin			1
elsewhere , @entity3 's heart was missing when the tomb was discovered by @entity52 in 1922			1
religious texts claimed @entity20 ' heart was similarly removed by his brother @entity55			0

during mummification a decision was made to not only embalm the erect penis , but also to cover the king ’s body in black liquid - similar in colour to the skin of @entity20 - and remove his heart			1
there was also no sign of a heart scarab , an amulet placed on dead bodies to demonstrate their ‘ worthiness ’ to travel to the afterlife and for resurrection			0
religious texts claimed @entity20 ’ heart was removed by his brother @entity55 and buried separately			0
these three rituals , according to professor @entity102 from the university , were done in order to make people think @entity3 was the underworld god			2

on the outside of the tomb , decorations depicted @entity3 as @entity20 , while wall paintings , pictured , showed the king being embraced by the underworld god			1

@entity3 ’s tomb was first discovered in the early 20th century
the mummy was found covered in black liquid and missing a heart
his penis was also embalmed at a 90 - degree angle , but has since *fallen* off
researchers now believe these bizarre rituals were a bid to make the young pharaoh resemble @entity20 , the god of the underworld
this may have been to quash a religious revolution in the 1320s @entity64
