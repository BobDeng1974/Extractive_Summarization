normally , they are to be found pulling @entity2 ’s sleigh over roof - tops to the delight of countless children			1
but this festive season , reindeer can be found in a much more mundane location — stacked in packs in the deli aisle of a budget @entity13 supermarket			1
for @entity16 , whose dramatic price - discounting has lured shoppers away from its rivals , is selling smoked reindeer meat this year among its @entity21 delicacies			1
the packs are part of the @entity26 - owned chain ’s ‘ deluxe ’ range			1
but are we @entity28 — brought up on stories of @entity31 — too sentimental to want a slice of @entity33 with our @entity21 lunch ? and in any case , what does it taste like ? normally reindeer are associated with pulling @entity2 ’s sleigh the delight of countless children			1
but this festive season , reindeer can be found stacked in packs in the deli aisle of a budget @entity13 supermarket according to @entity16 bosses , ‘ reindeer resembles antelope in flavour and texture			1
’ but since most @entity28 will never have tasted antelope , this is n’t the most useful recommendation			0
so i decided to test it for myself and found some of this ‘ tender and flavoursome ’ @entity59 delicacy sitting in the chiller cabinet in @entity16 ’s store in @entity62 , @entity63 , alongside other cured meats			1
it comes from a company in @entity67 , with the meat originally from @entity69			0
the animals are not kept in farms but are herded in the wild			0
not surprisingly , the company that produces the meat has been accused by animal welfare groups of delivering ‘ sick novelty for profit ’ and making a mockery of the festive season			1
@entity79 decided to test it and found some of this ‘ tender and flavoursome ’ @entity59 delicacy in @entity16 @entity82 , of the animal welfare and vegetarian group @entity85 ! , is also concerned that wild predators of reindeer , such as wolves and bears , are shot to protect supplies for retailers			1
he says : ‘ what @entity16 are n’t telling their customers is that to put reindeer meat on @entity28 shelves , other large wild animals are systematically hunted or trapped and shot			1
’ @entity16 denies this claim			0
a spokesman says the animals are slaughtered under @entity103 guidelines and meet the firm ’s ‘ high standards of food safety , hygiene and animal welfare ’			2
she adds : ‘ the smoked reindeer that we sell is from the @entity112 autonomous region in @entity113			2
the reindeers pasture freely in the tundra year around , changing location on almost a weekly basis			0
’ in that area of @entity113 , reindeer are vital to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of indigenous herders in @entity69 ’s ‘ @entity122 ’ , where temperatures can drop to minus 50c			1
the animals are used for meat , for skins to make clothes and tents , and to tow sledges			0
according to the @entity69 , reindeer meat is ‘ ecologically clean ’			1
certainly , it is exceptionally lean — comparing favourably with fish for its high levels of health - boosting chemicals , such as omega - 3 fatty acids , which protect against breast cancer and heart disease			0
im a paper published last year , @entity141 , of the @entity142 of @entity143 said : ‘ reindeer meat is very healthy			1
‘ it contains more than double the values of some nutrients as other meats , and is comparable to chicken in fat			0
reindeer meat also has more than twice as much vitamin @entity151 [ which helps prevent anaemia ] as veal or lamb			1
’ one of the reasons for its nutritious value is the animal ’s diet , which , in the winter , is comprised mainly of lichens ( which are rich in selenium , zinc and iron )			2
but reindeer meat is hardly known in the @entity28 — and when @entity168 offered a recipe for reindeer stew on his tv series , @entity168 ’s @entity171 , there was a strong reaction from viewers			1
reindeer meat is hardly known in the @entity28 — and when @entity168 offered a recipe for reindeer stew on his tv series , @entity168 ’s @entity171 , there was a strong reaction from viewers so what will consumers make of @entity16 ’s carpaccio - style 100g packs of @entity181 ? the slices of meat are dark maroon in colour and smell overpoweringly smoky			1
my husband pronounced them ‘ delicious ’ , but could n’t resist asking : ‘ is this @entity189 , @entity189 , @entity189 or @entity189 ? ’ he said the steaks smelled ‘ lovely , quite delicate			2
like @entity192 salami , very smoky			0
a taste sensation , very salty			0
it ’s less gamey tasting than venison			0
’ masterchef judge @entity197 is not a fan of reindeer meat however , food writer @entity200 , who has a more professional palate , disagrees			1
she agrees that reindeer meat , which is essentially venison , is a lean and healthy option , but says these cured slices have ‘ a horrible strong flavour — salty and artificially smoky ’			1
she also points out that they are made from ‘ reformed meat ’ , meaning they have been chopped to a mush then shaped into a salami			2
when she tried them , she says : ‘ they were sweaty when they came out of the pack , then began to dry out quickly			0
’ she concludes : ‘ it is a very nasty product and a waste of good meat			2
i do n’t think reindeer meat slices will find much of a market in @entity28 , not just because of the emotional reaction to them , but also because they taste disgusting			1
’ @entity197 , @entity223 judge and editor of @entity226 magazine , is not a fan either			1
‘ i like eating venison			0
i think it ’s important to eat free - range game — a mostly happy life , a lean meat — so good for the tummy and soul , ’ he says			2
but he says the cured cuts ‘ look awful ’			2
‘ why turn a wild product into something that looks cheaper than processed ham — the little roundels just cheapen its identity			0
‘ it ’s shiny and gelatinous , which is not pleasant on the eye			2
’ he adds : ‘ then there is the flavour			0
any merit the meat might have had is overwhelmed by too much smoke and too much salt			0
‘ the only way to eat this would be buried in a bun with lashings of pickle and salad			0
it ’s a shame , an opportunity missed to encourage people to eat more natural food			0
’ reindeer are strong runners and are the most energy efficient of all land animals for its part , @entity16 says its reindeer meat is selling well — particularly in the @entity267			1
perhaps the last word should go to one of the chain ’s checkout girls			0
as she packs my shopping , she says : ‘ i ’ve eaten venison			0
’ i ask her if she has tried the reindeer			0
‘ not the reindeer , ’ she says			2
‘ i think eating @entity31 would be a step too far for me			0

normally reindeer are associated with pulling @entity2 ’s sleigh
but now reindeer can be found in the aisles of a @entity13 supermarket
