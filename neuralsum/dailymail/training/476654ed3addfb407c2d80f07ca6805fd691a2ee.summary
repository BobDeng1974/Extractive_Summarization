a mother has been given a new zest for life after losing 11 stone through diet and exercise			1
@entity6 , 40 , once weighed 21st 1lb and wore size 34 clothing			1
her large size made it difficult for her to move around pain free and she felt ashamed that her daughter had a ' fat mum '			1
now @entity6 , of @entity14 , has completely transformed her lifestyle and her figure - and has never felt better			1
she used to weight 21st 1lb she now weighs 9st 11lb and is a size eight and teaches five @entity18 classes a week to help other people improve their health and fitness			1
she said : ' i 'm fitter and happier , and i 'm much more capable of dealing with the challenges which life throws at me			0
' i love teaching classes , and i get a huge amount of satisfaction at being able to provide a service for other women who are keen to become healthier			2
' @entity6 piled on the pounds after having her daughter , daughter @entity33 , now 14 , as she suffered from severe postnatal depression			1
through comfort eating , she gained seven stone in just three years			0
she said : ' i developed what i consider now to be an addiction to food			2
in the depths of depression i felt as if i could n't control anything - but i could control what i ate			2
so if i wanted to have a bar of chocolate or a round of toast to make me feel better , i did n't hold back			2
' as the weight piled on , she began experiencing joint and back pain and was so depressed she would avoid leaving the house unless strictly necessary			1
comfort eater : @entity6 , pictured with her daughter as a toddler , piled on the pounds due to post natal depression low confidence : she was concerned that her daughter would be bullied because of her size she said : ' it became increasingly difficult to move around , which just fed into the cycle			1
after a while even something as simple as standing up long enough to finish washing the dishes was extremely difficult			0
' on the rare occasions when i did venture out of the house , i felt as if i was under scrutiny			0
little children would point at me and ask their parents why i was so large			1
when i went shopping , i was paranoid that people were peering into my shopping basket , looking for sweets and treats which would explain why i was so fat			1
' when @entity33 turned three , @entity6 made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her daughter			1
she said : ' i could n't bare the thought of @entity82 being bullied in school			2
i had been larger than average at school and had experienced some bullying			0
i did n't want @entity82 to be made an object of fun because she had a fat mum			1
transformed : @entity6 was a dress size 34 , right , until she stuck to a diet and joined the gym			1
now she 's a size 8 ' in the years since her birth i 'd tried dieting , but had only managed to yo - yo my weight			1
i realised i could only make a lasting change if i overhauled my whole attitude to food			1
' she swapped her toast with butter and cheese for breakfast for porridge			0
the ham and coleslaw sandwiches she once had for lunch were replaced with a more protein - heavy meal such as chicken with salad			0
the creamy chicken pasta bake with garlic bread she once devoured as an evening meal was ditched in favour of brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon			2
and she resisted snacking on a family - sized bar of milk chocolate throughout the day like she used to			0
along with her new healthy eating plan , which she still maintains , she joined her local gym where she started doing cardio interval training			0
she said : ' i hated doing the gym at first , but doing a bit of running , followed by a bit of cross training and rowing , made it more varied and interesting			0
' follow my lead : @entity6 teaches @entity18 to help other people gain the benefits of being fit and healthy seven months after changing her diet , she lost eight stone and this encouraged her to keep going with her new , healthy lifestyle			1
she said : ' a personal instructor at the gym liked to demonstrate how much i was losing by going into the weights room and coming out with the equivalent of what i 'd lost between milestones			1
it was a huge motivator			0
' then she discovered @entity18 classes - which led to her following a new career path			2
she explained : ' i decided to investigate @entity18 classes			2
i loved the energy and the music , but at one class the instructor was so bored and listless that i thought , " i could do better than this "			2
' breakfast @entity158 : toast with butter and cheese now : porridge lunch @entity158 : ham and coleslaw sandwiches and family - sized milk chocolate bar now : chicken with salad dinner @entity158 : creamy chicken pasta bake with garlic bread now : @entity171 with steamed vegetables and salmon she took a training course to become an official instructor and led her first class in june 2011			0
she said : ' being up there in front a class is a huge rush			0
i 'm proud of my commitment towards the women in my classes			0
i 'll never let them down - even if there 's only three or four people in the class , i 'll never call a class off			2
' now @entity6 says she 's glad her daughter has a mother she can feel proud of and she sets her an example of healthy living			1
she said : ' @entity82 's enormously proud of me , too			0
she looks at pictures of the old me and ca n't quite believe it			0
' i 'm happy to say that she 's fitter and stronger than i was at her age			0
she 's very mindful of nutrition and loves kickboxing			0
it 's satisfying to see that she 's managed to avoid some of the traps i fell into at that age			0
