at 206kg and only 20 years old @entity0 was the youngest and heaviest person to audition for @entity1			1
but he did n't make the cut in the final stages for the weight loss reality show and the devastating news caused @entity0 to spiral into a deep depression			1
he had pinned every bit of hope he had left on being a contestant to drop the excessive kilos he had struggled with since he was a child growing up in @entity10 , in southwest @entity11			2
but he slowly overcame the setback and shed an astounding 80kg over the next five years and has maintained his 125kg ripped body for the past three years			1
now 28 years old and working as a personal trainer - @entity0 is living proof to his clients that anything is possible without taking extreme measures			1
the trainer has hit out at the reality show on his blog comparing it to a ' @entity25 game show			1
' it was n't the food i was addicted to but the act of eating - it was like mental rewards going off in my brain , ' he told @entity46			1
@entity0 had weight - loss surgery at 18 years - old , the year before he auditioned for @entity1 in 2006 , which involved a gastric band inserted to reduce the amount he ate			1
he lost 40kg in six months but said the surgery ' does n't work just like diets '			1
so when @entity0 applied for the tv show - he was determined this was the break he had been looking for			1
but his world came crashing down around him when the casting agent called with the bad news as he was halfway through an assignment at university			2
' she wished me all the best with my weight loss and told me to contact her should i need anything , ' he said			2
all my life i ’d been too fat , now at this moment i felt like i was n’t fat enough			2
i felt like a failure			2
' ' all of the happily ever after pictures that had been running through my mind shattered into a million pieces			0
i would have to say that was the most heart broken i ’d ever been in my life			0
' ' i left uni and cried for the entire day			0
i never finished that assessment , i failed that subject and almost failed the entire semester			0
i look back on that day now as my sliding door moment			0
' @entity0 quit his job in it sales and studied as a personal trainer in 2011 no regrets : @entity0 dropped the weight on his own @entity0 then stayed at about 200kg for the next four years			1
it was n't until 2010 when he went to a weight loss retreat in the @entity83 , about 50km north of @entity11 , for four weeks that his life began to transform and he never looked back			1
' it was a great experience and the beginning of my changes , ' he said			0
' it was the first time i learnt any kind of sustained exercise and it helped me develop a passion for fitness			0
' his passion for exercise became so strong that he studied as a personal trainer the following year			1
he also quite his job in it insurance and worked part time at a health food store			0
' i trained with people who inspired me and created an environment around me of people who motivated me so it was n't hard to be healthy everyday			1
' following his success story , @entity0 wrote a scathing blog about @entity1 saying contestants ' ca n’t come out of an experience like that and just be ok '			1
' deep emotional and mental issues that caused the eating addiction in the first place are just brushed aside , replaced by the distraction of the competition , the thrill of potentially life changing prize money , and the promise of dramatic weight loss , combined with the ultimate accountability , cameras broadcasting you to an entire nation , ' he says in his blog			0
@entity125 feels like a completely different person from his heftier days @entity127 added that the show was not about telling the success stories of people achieving their goals			0
' if that were the case then it would n’t be a glorified @entity25 game show , ' his blog said			0
' contestants would n’t be forced to compete against each other in weigh - ins , you would n’t have survivor style vote offs , you would n’t reward for extreme weight loss and punish for weight gain			2
' @entity0 said he has met former contestants and seen first hand the toll it had taken on them			1
' i ’m not sure of the percentage but i know that the majority of the contestants have struggled to maintain their weight once leaving the show , ' he said			0
he then refers in his blog to a 2008 contestant @entity151 who claims that about 75 per cent of the contestants from that series were back at their starting weight			0
@entity0 told @entity46 a female contestant from the show joined him at the weight - loss retreat in 2010			1
' she was really struggling with weight at the time , he said			0
' she had put all of the weight back on - plus more - and is now left with even more damage to try to clear up than she when she started			2
' @entity0 ( centre ) still indulges in fast food including pizza , burger and fries when he feels like it @entity0 lives with no regrets saying that not being rejected for the show meant that he had to learn to change his lifestyle without support			1
' i had to take the time to fail over and over and over again			0
i had to get comfortable with how long it takes , and i had to slowly cultivate an environment that supports a healthy life , ' he said ' most importantly i had to learn about balance , integrating health and fitness seamlessly into my life to create sustainability			0
although he admits it was a tough road and there was a lot more to turning his life around than ' cutting out @entity187 's and getting a gym membership ' - he still indulges when he likes			2
' now that i work out six days a week including weight training three to four times a week - i can eat what i like , ' he said			2
' though i have a lot of veggies , fruit , dairy and unprocessed meats - i still have pizza on a saturday night if i want it			2
' he also enjoys chowing down on steak with a creamy sauce and burgers and a side of fries			0
the new improved @entity0 feels like a completely different person from his heftier days			1
' my shift in mind set has been so dramatic that is it hard to relate to that now , ' he said			0
' it 's hard to imagine trying to walk around with that kind of weight			0
