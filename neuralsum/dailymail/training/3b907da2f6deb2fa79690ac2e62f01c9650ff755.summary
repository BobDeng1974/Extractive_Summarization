common symptoms of depressive disorder are memory loss and blunted emotional responses severe depression and chronic stress can shrink the brain by blocking the formation of new nerve connections , a study has shown			1
the effect disrupts circuits associated with mental functioning and emotion			0
it could explain why people with major depressive disorder ( @entity17 ) suffer from concentration and memory loss , as well as blunted emotional responses			1
several genes involved in building synapses , the connection points between brain cells , were suppressed in people with @entity17 , scientists found			1
this was thought to contribute to shrinkage of the brain 's prefrontal cortex , which is known to occur in @entity17 sufferers			1
researchers in the @entity32 analysed brain tissue from patients who had died after being diagnosed with @entity17			1
they found molecular signs of reduced activity in genes necessary for the function and structure of brain synapses			2
evidence pointed to the involvement of a single genetic " switch " , or transcription factor - a protein called @entity46			0
turning on @entity46 reduced activity of the genes and triggered the loss of brain connections			1
study leader professor @entity51 , from @entity52 , said : ' we wanted to test the idea that stress causes a loss of brain synapses in humans			2
' we show that circuits normally involved in emotion , as well as cognition , are disrupted when this single transcription factor is activated			0
' the research is published in the latest issue of the journal @entity66			0
further studies on rats showed that when @entity46 was switched on , the rodents showed signs of depression			0
this suggests that loss of brain synapses may be linked to depressive symptoms as well as mental impairment			2
' we hope that by enhancing synaptic connections , either with novel medications or behavioural therapy , we can develop more effective antidepressant therapies , ' prof @entity51 added .			0
