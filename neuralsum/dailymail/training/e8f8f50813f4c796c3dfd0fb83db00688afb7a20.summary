the new year is expected to bring rising chicken egg prices across the @entity1 as @entity2 starts requiring farmers to house hens in cages with enough space to move around and stretch their wings			1
the new standard backed by animal rights advocates has drawn ire nationwide because farmers in @entity12 , @entity13 and other states who sell eggs in @entity2 have to abide by the same requirements			1
to comply , farmers have to put fewer hens into each cage or invest in revamped henhouses , passing along the expense to consumers shopping at grocery stores			1
@entity2 is the nation 's largest consumer of eggs and imports about one - third of its supply			1
caged chickens lay eggs in a chicken house built decades ago at an egg farm in @entity32 , @entity2 @entity33 , president and ceo of @entity35 in @entity12 and @entity13 , said one of his buildings that holds 1.5 million hens is now about half full to meet @entity2 's standards , and another building may have to be completely overhauled			1
farmers like him in cold climates will have to install heaters to replace warmth formerly generated by the chickens living close together			2
@entity33 said that 's something people in sunny @entity2 did n't consider			2
' you 're talking about millions upon millions of dollars , ' he said			0
' it 's not anything that 's cheap or that can be modified easily , not in the @entity53			0
' @entity2 voters in 2008 approved the law backed by animal rights advocates to get egg - laying hens out of cramped cages and put them by jan. 1 , 2015 , in larger enclosures that give them room to stretch , turn around and flap their wings			1
state legislators followed with the companion piece in 2010 requiring the out - of - state compliance			0
in anticipation , egg prices have already risen , said @entity69 of the @entity70 , adding that the holiday season , cold weather across the country and increased exports to @entity74 and @entity75 also contributed to a year - end price spike			2
he said he expected that supplies would remain adequate to meet demand			0
a farm worker collects eggs in an old - fashioned chicken house at an egg farm in @entity2 @entity83 , an agricultural economist at the @entity84 , said prices initially could rise dramatically this year but he expects them to eventually settle anywhere from 10 and 40 percent higher in @entity2 and return to their normal price elsewhere in the country			1
if farmers cut back the number of chickens so they can comply with @entity2 's cage law , @entity83 said that could reduce the number of eggs available			1
' when there 's that much uncertainty , i 'm thinking there may be some disruption in the market , ' he said			0
farmer @entity103 had take a loan of $ 200,000 to comply with the new requirement , and is in the process of converting to a cage - free system @entity108 , president and ceo of the @entity110 , said he believes the costs to consumers will be minimal and worth it for the welfare of chickens , which provide enough eggs for each person to consume on average 250 a year			2
for decades , he said , farmers have crammed six to eight chickens in small cages without room to move			0
' this is the last bastion of cage confinement in industrial ag , ' said @entity108 , whose organization led the reforms			0
@entity127 in december said it will eliminate the sale of eggs from caged hens , he said , following the lead of @entity132 and @entity133			0
the @entity134 , independent of the voter initiative , implemented rules that give chickens 70 percent more room , which @entity108 said is better but not enough			0
low - income people who rely on eggs as an economical source of protein may be hurt the worst by @entity2 's cage law , says a report this week by the @entity146 at @entity147			1
anticipating a 15 percent increase , the cost of a dozen eggs could rise by 27 cents , and a family of four could pay $ 15.93 more a year , the report says			2
@entity2 has prevailed in lawsuits , including six from major egg - producing states that argued the state is dictating market prices in other states in violation of the @entity159 of the @entity160			2
@entity162 of the @entity163 said @entity2 's egg law , in addition to driving up the cost at the grocery store and putting pressure on egg supplies , will result in more injuries to chickens because housing them in larger pens means they are more likely to run , breaking a leg or wing			1
' you 're not going to help the chicken , ' he said			0
' you 're not helping consumers			0
