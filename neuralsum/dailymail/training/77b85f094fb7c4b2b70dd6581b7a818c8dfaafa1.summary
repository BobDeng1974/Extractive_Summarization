recreational marijuana sellers are reaching out to novice cannabis users with a raft of edible products that impart a milder buzz and make it easy for inexperienced customers to find a dose they wo n't regret taking			1
in many ways , the marketing shift is the pot - industry equivalent of selling beer and wine alongside higher - alcohol options such as whiskey and vodka			1
' no one buys a handle of @entity18 and thinks they should drink all of that in one sitting , ' said @entity22 , owner of two @entity24 - area marijuana dispensaries			1
' but people do want to eat an entire cookie , an entire piece of chocolate			0
so these products allow you to do that and not have a miserable experience			2
state regulators recommend a 10mg dose as a single serving of the drug nine months into @entity44 's recreational pot experiment , retailers have good reason to court new users			2
a market study released in july suggested 40 percent of customers in @entity24 - area recreational marijuana shops are tourists			1
that figure spikes to 90 percent in ski towns such as @entity53 or @entity54			0
tourists can not shop in medical - marijuana dispensaries , so many of those customers may be buying legal weed for the first time			1
new on the shelves in @entity44 's recreational pot shops is the ' @entity34 , ' a marijuana - infused confection that contains 10 milligrams of marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient			1
that 's a low enough dose that most adults would n't be too impaired to drive a car			0
then there 's a new marijuana - infused soda that 's 15 times weaker than the company 's best - known soda			1
the @entity74 watermelon cream soda contains 5 milligrams of @entity35 — half of what the state considers a serving size — and is billed as ' great for those who are new to @entity35 or do n't like to share			1
' the wave of lighter choices comes as the new industry tries to pivot away from products aimed at frequent , heavy pot users to newer customers who were n't interested in the drug when it was illegal			1
' for a long time , the medical market was a race to the strongest edibles			0
now it 's a new market , and people want something that wo n't get them so inebriated they 're not functional , ' said @entity94 of the @entity95 , which makes the ' @entity34 ' and is phasing out some of its stronger offerings			0
this pot - infused soda , @entity98 , has 5mg of @entity35 - 15 times less than regular - strength counterparts there 's no publicly available data on which products are selling			1
but interviews with dispensary owners and marijuana producers suggest the lighter products are booming			1
' we still get people walking in here saying , ' what 's the strongest thing ? ' but more and more they 're asking about flavor , the experience , the whole nine yards , ' @entity22 said			0
in @entity117 , where sales of edibles are just beginning in recreational pot shops , some of the first licensed edible - makers are taking a similar approach			1
the entire product line at @entity123 in @entity124 is based around the idea that consumers can control the effect they want — an idea based in part on market research that suggested people often had bad experiences because they over-consumed marijuana edibles			2
among the products @entity123 hopes to get on retail shelves in the coming weeks are liquid drops that can be added to beverages in precise amounts			0
' we recognize there are going to be a lot of nontraditional users coming into the market , or people who have used in the past a long time ago and who are just getting back into it , ' said @entity147 , one of the company 's founders			0
there 's more than market share at stake			0
marijuana - legalization activists want to tamp down stories about pot users who got sick after eating potent medical - grade cannabis , an experience so common it seems everyone in @entity24 knows someone who endured it			1
most serious was the march death of a college student who had never tried pot before visiting @entity24 for spring break			0
the man ate a single cookie that contained 65 milligrams of @entity35 , then jumped to his death from a hotel balcony after his friends said he started acting erratically			2
and @entity172 columnist @entity171 famously wrote in june of trying a marijuana - infused candy bar , after which she ' lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours			2
' @entity44 dispensaries have launched a ' @entity179 5 ' campaign of posters to encourage new users to take a 5 milligram half - dose of marijuana to make sure they do n't overdo it			2
a marijuana advocacy group has taken out billboards and magazine ads with the tagline ' @entity189 , @entity190			0
' at least one marketing expert warned that pot producers need to be careful not to claim their products wo n't cause intoxication			2
' is it too early in the industry to go claiming what 's a low dose and what 's a medium dose ? ' asked @entity201 of @entity202 , @entity203 , who consults for manufacturers and runs a ' @entity206 ' blog			0
' we want to create a place for new consumers in our industry			0
we just need to be aware that we do n't get ahead of the science			0

pot activists fear stories of marijuana tourists taking too much @entity216 hurt the industry
companies are beginning to manufacture new products that have as little as 5mg of @entity35 in them
some new products are 15 times weaker than their regular - strength counterparts
