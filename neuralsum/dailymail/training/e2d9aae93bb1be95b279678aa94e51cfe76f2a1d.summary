by @entity0 this is the moment a gormless burglar realises he has been caught red - handed on cctv - seconds before he attempts to cover up his crime by stealing the camera			1
the open - mouthed thief stares directly into the lens for several seconds , seemingly unable to decide what to do with himself			1
he then appears to shout the word ‘ camera ’ , before continuing to stare at the lens - still with his mouth wide open			1
the defeated - looking burglar is then seen turning the camera to face the wall , before wrenching it from its stand and stuffing it in his bag			1
but unbeknown to the burglar , his efforts were pointless - because the video is still accessible in online storage			1
@entity41 installed the high - tech camera in his parent 's home in @entity19 , @entity20 , in a bid to catch any intruders after they were burgled in november			1
the camera , which he had imported from the @entity49 , records straight onto the internet and goes into online storage			2
he has now shared the footage - including several still image from the video - on social media websites			0
the man seems to shout the word ' camera ' , suggesting there could have been an accomplice with him during the raid at the family home the 30 - year - old , a property developer based in @entity65 , said : ' the look on the guy ’s face is priceless as he tries to figure out what to do next			1
' hilariously he then belatedly tries to hide from the camera by ducking underneath it			2
he obviously thought by stealing it would hide his crime but the footage was already sent to an online server			0
' my parents were robbed in november and i suspected they would be back so i installed the camera			2
' it ’s the first camera of its kind and it ’s not available in the @entity82 , i had it imported from the @entity49			2
there ’s no evidence for the burglars to steal			0
it records straight to the internet and goes into storage			0
the defeated - looking burglar , who took cash and sentimental jewellery from the home , then starts to walk towards the lens hilariously , the thief then ducks beneath the camera , despite having been recorded on film for the past 20 seconds			1
he then turns the camera away from him ' it is basically a web camera but the sophisticated stuff is where it gets recorded to			2
you can hear him talking and he is talking to someone else so there ’s at least two of them			0
' he was mentioning a camera and before that he shouts something , it sounds like he is calling out a name			2
' the man raided the family home on saturday afternoon between 1.30pm and 2.30pm			1
mr @entity41 said nothing expensive was taken during the raid but he has appealed for help in tracing two items of sentimental value which he believes were taken			1
before realising he was caught on @entity18 , the brazen thief fiddled with the door in the living room he said : ' my brother @entity126 passed away and left a gold necklace and @entity130 amulet			0
this was intended for his unborn son			2
he is having a child and it was meant to be gift for him			0
' his sister , @entity136 , 32 , added : ' we are upset and angry this has happened , given the recent death of my brother we are all going through an emotional time			0

' we believe he may have been carrying a weapon at the time of the burglary and would urge people to get in touch straight away if they recognise him			0
. ' a spokesperson for the force added : ' officers are investigating all leads , including @entity18 footage provided by the home owner			0
