speaking out : @entity2 business and education minister @entity0 has urged bosses to hire @entity4 rather than immigrants firms have a duty to hire @entity4 rather than immigrants , a minister declared last night			1
@entity0 urged bosses to avoid the ‘ easy option ’ of filling jobs with foreign workers when they could train local recruits instead			1
courting controversy , the @entity2 business and education minister insisted that taking on @entity4 employees was better both for firms and the wider economy			1
the @entity21 ’s immigration clampdown means foreigners now take 55 per cent of vacancies compared with 74 per cent under @entity24 when @entity25 pledged ‘ @entity4 jobs for @entity4 workers ’			1
but mr @entity0 believes firms can bring the figure even lower			1
‘ as vacancies rise , and unemployment falls further , it is the duty of companies , especially big business , to take on local young people – not immediately take the easy option of recruiting from abroad , ’ he said			1
his intervention reflects official fears of an influx of @entity38 and @entity39 when restrictions on their rights to work here end in january			1
mr @entity0 rejected a claim from the independent @entity44 that 60,000 foreign workers are needed annually to keep national debt at sustainable levels			1
‘ i do n’t agree , ’ he told the @entity48			0
‘ immigration without support for people who are here masks problems			0
' it does n’t solve them			0
the jobs are increasingly there – we ’ve got record numbers of jobs			0
‘ what we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them			2
‘ it is sometimes harder to take on a young unemployed local person but , in the long term , it ’s better for the business and it ’s better for the whole economy			1
‘ the evidence shows that if you take on somebody and put them through an apprenticeship or a traineeship , you get somebody who has an attachment to the company which has given them a chance , and you get higher morale not only among the people you take on but also existing staff			0
worried : mr @entity0 's intervention reflects official fears of an influx of @entity38 and @entity39 when restrictions on their rights to work here end in january ‘ they know a company is doing right by the local community			1
’ mr @entity0 , who is a close ally of chancellor @entity93 , said he understood why so many firms had taken on immigrants			1
but he added : ‘ to build a strong , long - term economy we have got to play our part in government and businesses need to take their responsibility			2
' the jobs are increasingly there – we ’ve got record numbers of jobs			0
what we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them			2
' @entity0 mp ‘ the easiest way for me to get a group of business people to nod their heads is to say that for far too long people coming out of our education system have n’t had what it takes to hold down a job			1
‘ it ’s about the correct attitude , as well as skills in @entity122 and maths			0
we are doing a series of things in terms of reform of education and welfare to address this and we are supporting apprenticeships and traineeships for those who need better skills			0
’ mr @entity0 , who is responsible for skills and has posts in both the business and education ministries , said the government would launch a traineeship scheme next month to improve @entity122 and maths skills			1
he added : ‘ we need employers to play their part because experience of a job is vital for getting a job			2
‘ we are making it as easy as possible for employers to play their part so they have no excuse for not taking on and training up young unemployed people			0
not local : @entity39 immigrant workers , pictured working on @entity154 , in @entity155 , @entity156 ‘ many companies do this already – @entity164 ’s has a strong apprenticeship scheme , as do many manufacturers like @entity167 and @entity168			1
companies like @entity158 , @entity160 bicycles and @entity161 are backing the new traineeships			0
‘ but only 7 per cent of companies currently have an apprentice			2
' it would be wrong for companies without an apprenticeship scheme to recruit from overseas without looking at what they can do to take on local people			2
’ several @entity179 countries have recently imposed some limited immigration controls on @entity182 nationals – controls that are legally permitted by the @entity182 in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			0
in 2011 , @entity185 won the right to reintroduce immigration controls on @entity38 migrants as unemployment soared			2
@entity190 has set out plans to reinforce rules restricting access to benefits , the @entity195 and social housing for @entity179 immigrants			0
ministers are introducing a healthcare levy expected to be at least £ 200 a year to ensure migrants contribute toward the cost of @entity195 care			0
@entity182 law requires companies to consider applications for vacancies from @entity182 nationals			2
but employers can say they need fluent @entity122 speakers for a job and reject a foreign worker on those grounds			0
the government has introduced a cap on the number of skilled workers from outside the @entity182 , in an effort to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			0
there have been calls for a crackdown on employment agencies that focus on immigrant workers			0
new call : mr @entity0 would like firms to hire and train local employees rather than foreign workers			1

@entity2 mp @entity0 wants firms to train local workers on the job
he says that hiring @entity4 workers will boost firms and the economy
