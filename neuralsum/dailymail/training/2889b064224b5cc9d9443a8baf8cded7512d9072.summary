by @entity0 published : 08:18 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 17 may 2012 difficult decision : after being told there was a chance the cancer would return @entity5 underwent a double mastectomy a 23 - year - old decided to have a double mastectomy , after doctors told her there was a chance her breast cancer could return			1
@entity5 's difficult decision began when she discovered a lump in her breast last august			2
but doctors reassured her it was unlikely to be anything to worry about			0
due to her young age and with no history of breast cancer in her family , medics suggested it could be linked to her hormone cycle rather than anything as sinister as breast cancer			1
but when the lump was still there eight weeks later , she returned to her gp for further investigations			0
she asked to be referred to the @entity34 ’s first purpose - built breast cancer prevention and research facility - to undergo more tests			1
ms @entity5 's worst fears were realised when a scan revealed she had cancer - making her one of the youngest women in @entity40 to be diagnosed with the disease			2
doctors advised she needed surgery and intensive chemotherapy to save her life			0
ms @entity5 , now 24 , said : ' it took a few weeks for me to be diagnosed , i think because the doctors thought i was just too young to have breast cancer			1
' i was really shocked when i was told			0
i do n’t remember much about that day but i know it did n’t seem real to me at all			0
the whole experience was traumatic			0
' at the same time ms @entity5 , from @entity52 , also decided to undergo egg harvesting because there was a risk that the treatment would leave her unable to have children naturally			0
decision : ms @entity5 asked to be referred to the @entity59 , right , @entity34 ’s first purpose - built breast cancer prevention and research facility to undergo more tests after she found a lump in her breast graph : female breast cancer is strongly related to age , with the highest rates overall being in older women so ms @entity5 's case is very rare - this graph shows in 2007/2008 only 28 women aged 20 to 24 were diagnosed with breast cancer surgeons initially believed she had responded well to the chemotherapy , but she was dealt a fresh blow when further checks showed that traces of the disease remained			1
the next step was to undergo radiotherapy			0
but doctors told her there was still a 38 per cent chance of the disease returning , leading to @entity5 ’s brave decision three months ago to undergo a double mastectomy			1
she first talked through the procedure with counsellors at the @entity91 charity , and later also underwent reconstructive surgery			0
cancer is less common in adolescents and young adults than in older people , and for this reason it can often be misdiagnosed or overlooked			0
@entity98 , breast cancer surgeon and chairman of @entity101 , says less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer			1
he adds : ' it ’s very rare that @entity5 has developed breast cancer at such a young age - 23 - years - old is particularly young			1
' it is thought that at least half of the young women in this age group who develop breast cancer do so because they have a strong genetic predisposition to the disease , such as the @entity115 and @entity116 genes			1
' one person in every 200 carries one of these faulty genes , which cause an 80 to 90 per cent risk of developing breast cancer in a lifetime			2
this compares to the ‘ normal risk ’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer			2
the procedures have given her the best protection against the cancer coming back , and doctors now believe she has an excellent prognosis			1
but there is no denying the circumstances ms @entity5 faced were rare			0
@entity98 , breast cancer surgeon and chairman of @entity101 , says less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer			1

this compares to the ‘ normal risk ’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer			2
ms @entity5 ’s case was different because she could find no evidence of breast cancer when she looked through her family tree			1
' we looked back at my family history and could find no history of the disease which makes it more unusual , ' she says			0
' it was out of the blue			0
' it is boosting research into the condition which is now driving @entity5 forward as she organises a charity ball in aid of @entity101			0
the former pupil of @entity175 in @entity176 is organising @entity178 and @entity177 at @entity179 , which will take place on october 27			0
she hopes it will become an annual event , and is also taking part in the @entity184 through @entity185 next month			0
ms @entity5 , who has just returned to work in customer service for a clothing company , says : ' i want to give something back to @entity101			2
' although rare , other young woman in the @entity191 have undergone a double mastectomy in the battle against cancer			1
in 2009 , aged 18 , @entity195 became the youngest woman in @entity191 to have a double mastectomy in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of breast cancer which has haunted her family			1
it followed the diagnosis of two of her cousins with breast cancer , both in their early twenties - an unusually young age			2
both were subsequently found to have the same faulty gene .			0

after being told there was a 38 *%* chance the cancer would return @entity5 underwent a double mastectomy three months ago
procedure has given her the best protection against the cancer coming back , and doctors now believe she has an excellent prognosis
less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer
