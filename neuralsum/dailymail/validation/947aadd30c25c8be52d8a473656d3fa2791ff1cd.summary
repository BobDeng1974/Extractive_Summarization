for @entity3 , the battle for control of @entity2 is all but over			1
the resignation of @entity6 chairman @entity5 on monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board			1
yet , the hard work starts here as @entity3 and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration , then liquidation , visited @entity17			1
here , @entity18 looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in @entity3 ’s packed in - tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years			1
@entity3 is set to take control of @entity2 after chairman @entity25 resigned from post on monday 1			1
appoint a new executive team with the repayment of @entity30 ’s £ 5million loan , and running costs of upwards of £ 25m over the next two years , @entity2 need a top - class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club ’s financial future			1
after friday ’s extraordinary general meeting , @entity3 will install his allies @entity38 and @entity40 as directors			2
the two remaining current plc directors , @entity43 , @entity2 ’ chief executive , and @entity45 , director of finance , are not expected to tender their resignations			2
but @entity3 ’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost			2
not surprisingly to those following this rapacious @entity2 saga , @entity43 and @entity45 have both just been awarded bumper contracts , complete with lengthy notice periods			2
appoint a manager @entity56 tendered his resignation in january and the uncomfortable - looking 51 - year - old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of @entity2 a minute longer than he absolutely has to			1
under his management , performances have been poor with @entity2 winning just two of their last six games			0
but it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the @entity6 side to be overtaken by @entity68 and @entity69 for a place in the play - offs			1
@entity72 is being viewed as the favourite for the post , while fans would love to see @entity3 bring back @entity76 , even in a short - term capacity			1
but whoever the new manager is , the speedier the appointment , the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion			0
what is unarguable is this : the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by @entity88 and @entity56 if @entity2 are to overcome a @entity90 side that has swatted them aside with ease in the championship this season			0
interim @entity2 manager @entity56 does not want the job a minute longer than he has to 3			0
player recruitment there are 12 @entity2 first - team players out of contract in the summer			1
captain @entity99 , plus @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 all see their deals run out on june 1 , 2015			0
the sheer volume of out - of - contract players makes it easy for the new boss to carry out a mass cull of what was described by @entity6 legend @entity118 as ‘ probably the worst ever ’ team in @entity2 history			1
yet from such a late starting point , the clock is ticking for the new regime to make wholesale changes			0
and with out - of - contract players free to speak to suitors since january 1 , @entity2 are already behind the eight ball in recruiting @entity129 signings			1
@entity30 and onerous contracts @entity30 's crisis loans kept the @entity6 club afloat in recent times in exchange for security over pretty much everything bar @entity6 , not to mention an increasingly large share of retail revenues			1
the contracts with @entity30 ’s @entity140 are currently the biggest drain on income at @entity6			0
analysis by the @entity144 suggests that for every £ 10 spent on merchandise , @entity2 receive an eye - wateringly poor 75p			2
the suggestions are that these onerous deals are watertight but @entity3 ’s team need to find out if there is room for manoeuvre			0
they will also need to go through everything they find with a fine - tooth comb to ensure @entity30 is not leaving behind any nasty surprises			0
@entity30 's crisis loans kept @entity2 afloat but in exchange for a large share of retail revenues 5			0
@entity160 fit and proper tests having won the war to take control at @entity6 , @entity3 now needs to convince the @entity160 he is a fit and proper person to become a director of @entity2			1
a member of the club board under @entity169 that eventually saw @entity2 liquidated in 2012 , tax offences in @entity166 saw @entity3 fork out £ 44m in settlement in 2013			1
that raises issues because the @entity160 ’s professional game board look at whether a proposed director has been convicted within the last 10 years of ‘ ( i ) an offence liable to imprisonment of two years or over , ( ii ) corruption or ( iii ) fraud ’			0
the @entity180 board also considers whether the applicant has been a director at a club within the five years preceding an insolvency event			0
@entity3 ’s prolonged struggle with the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) has been raised repeatedly by the current plc board			0
but @entity186 has imposed no restriction on @entity3 acting as a company director and he remains ‘ confident ’ of passing the @entity160 ’s fit - and - proper - person tests			2
@entity38 , who was sacked from the @entity6 board by @entity192 , must also convince the @entity160 he is a fit and proper person to be a director			0
infrastructure @entity2 fans regularly complain about the decrepit state of @entity6			1
cash is needed to bring it back up to acceptable standard , especially with fans likely to return through the gates in numbers to support the popular new regime			0
the club ’s @entity205 training base at @entity207 , which opened 14 years ago , is also badly in need of renovation			0
furthermore , @entity2 will have to fork out to appoint a team of talent spotters given that the club ’s scouting network was scrapped when @entity214 left in april 2013			2
former boss @entity88 previously described the need for a scouting system at @entity2 as : ‘ my no 1 priority for the club moving ahead			2
’ money needs to be spent on bringing @entity6 back up to an acceptable standard			0

@entity5 resigned as @entity2 chairman on monday morning
@entity3 is set to take control of the @entity6 club in the next *48* hours
here , @entity18 looks at the most pressing tasks in the @entity2 in - tray
