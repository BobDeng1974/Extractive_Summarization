by @entity0 an angler has broken the record for the biggest fish ever caught off @entity5 shores - and it weighs more than a gorilla			1
the common skate fish , which was caught off the @entity8 , was so big that fisherman @entity9 spent two hours struggling to reel it in			1
when he finally got back to shore , the 26 - year - old from @entity12 , @entity13 , discovered his catch weighed 208lbs - more than a female @entity16 , a heavyweight boxer or a moped			1
what a catch ! @entity9 , 26 , caught this 208lb skate fish while fishing off the @entity8 - the biggest fish to be caught off @entity5 shores the fish , a rare protected species similar to a stingray , was so large that the angler spent two hours reeling it in to shore , before tossing it back into the sea mr @entity9 , who returned the fish back into the sea , said : ' the key to catching the fish was having a lot of patience			1
my back is absolutely killing me now though			1
' we ’ve never caught anything on that scale before , and we guessed it weighed about 150lb			2
i ca n’t believe it			0
' the fisherman caught the skate - a rare protected fish species that looks similar to a stingray - after it latched onto half a mackerel fillet that mr @entity9 had used as bait			1
skates have a flat body and wing - like pectoral fins attached to their head , like a stingray			0
there are dozens of species of skates but the common skate is the largest skate species			2
a common skate can reach up to more than 8 ft ( 96 inches ) in length and 220lbs - though most males grow to around 60 inches			2
skates , which have a life span of around 50 years , can live in most parts of the world - whether tropical seas or near - @entity66 waters			0
they are usually found in deep waters but can also survive in shallow waters			0
the common skate is listed as a critically - endangered species			2
it is threatened both in the @entity74 and @entity75			0
their eggs , so - called mermaid ’s purses , are often found on beaches and are oblong and protected by leathery cases			0
the catch , which was 88.25 inches long by 66.75 inches wide , has now been confirmed by the @entity83 as the largest fish caught on its current list			1
although the fish was not weighed at the scene , because the anglers did not have scales , the weight was worked out by @entity91 - a @entity5 conservation charity - based on the measurements of the fish			1
before that , the largest fish caught from @entity5 shores was a 159lb skate , which was reeled in on the @entity98 in 1994			1
those anglers have since become ' local celebrities ' on @entity8 - but mr @entity9 says his girlfriend , @entity101 , is not quite as impressed			1
mr @entity9 , who works in a fishing supplies shop , said : ' my partner is not really that interested , but she ’s proud of me nonetheless			2
' i think people outside the angling world find it harder to see how much of a feat this is			0
' @entity110 is known for skate fishing but not @entity8			2
we were the first to catch one there for at least 30 or 40 years			0
' there was another chap in our group who caught one and it was about 120lb			0
we thought we ’d never find one any bigger - then we did an hour later			0
' the fish , which was 88.25inches long and 66.75inches wide , weighs more than a female gorilla , a heavyweight boxer or a moped and is the largest fish on record at the @entity83 @entity125 , secretary of the @entity83 , said : ' there is not a larger fish recorded as being caught on our current record list			1
' once we receive pictures from @entity131 we will pass them on to our scientist who will check the images and hopefully confirm the unofficial record			0
' it ca n’t be confirmed as a record as it was not weighed at the scene			0
' it will be seriously considered for the @entity139 , which was created for situations like this where the fish can not be weighed			0
this list is historically important , at least in the angling world			0
' the fish weighs more than a female eastern lowland gorilla here are some other things which weigh around the same amount as the skate fish caught by mr @entity9			1
fully - stocked fridge : 215lbs sir @entity152 in his prime : 220lbs female eastern lowland gorilla : 200lbs vespa moped : 197lbs heavyweight boxer : over 200lbs			1
