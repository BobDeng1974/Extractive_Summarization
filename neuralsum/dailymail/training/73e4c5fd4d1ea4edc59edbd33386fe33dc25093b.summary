a webcam has captured the dramatic moment a swat team swept in and arrested an online gamer after a hoax call claimed he was armed and dangerous			1
@entity6 was streaming a game of @entity8 yesterday when dozens of armed officers surrounded his office in @entity11 , @entity12 , and screamed at him to hit the deck			1
a prank caller had told police he was a gunman who shot two colleagues and took hostages in the latest case of a worrying trend known as ' swatting '			1
police warned yesterday the trend may one day result in an innocent person being shot dead			1
dozens of people were evacuated from the office building and two nearby schools were closed as a precaution			1
mr @entity6 , who goes by the name @entity32 and has 220,000 @entity52 followers , founded an online gaming group known as @entity54 and broadcasts daily on @entity56			2
he was midway through one of his streams at 11.30am when he paused , hearing officers bursting into room after room in the office block			2
' what in the world ? ' he said			0
' i think we 're getting swatted '			0
suddenly the officers crashed through the door screaming : ' put your hands up ! get on the f * * * * * * ground ! do n't you f * * * * * * move , you hear me boy ? ' confused : the officers asked the gamer what he was doing			1
when he said ' streaming ' , he had to elaborate stay on the ground : the team was in the room for several minutes as surrounding schools were locked down ' what about this is funny to you ? ' one officer asked , pointing his assault rifle towards the ground			1
' what ? ' mr @entity6 replied			0
' i 'm not doing anything that 's funny '			0
his game 's audio track then announced with perfect timing : ' terrorists win '			2
the officers frisked and questioned their suspect while his online gaming friends continued their armed assault in the virtual world and even killed his character			2
shock : a colleague live - tweeted the huge police raid the @entity2 officers then appeared confused about what the gamer was doing and asked him to explain			1
he replied : ' i 'm sitting there playing a game , people are watching it , and i guess a joker thought it would be funny to call you guys in			1
' mr @entity6 then had to show the officers in excruciating detail how to switch the camera off			0
a statement by the @entity122 of @entity11 said police , firefighters and other agencies responded to the call and searched the building thoroughly twice before questioning several employees			1
the spokesman added : ' the caller claimed to have shot two co-workers , held others hostage , and threatened to shoot them			1
he stated that if the officers entered he would shoot them as well			0
' law enforcement in the @entity136 and throughout the country are all too familiar with active shooter situations			0
in the wake of these incidents , @entity139 and other law enforcement agencies train for rapid response to quickly rescue victims and neutralize the situation			0
' fortunately there were no injuries today , but a massive law enforcement response wastes resources and greatly increases the chances of innocent people being injured or killed			2
' if the investigation determines that today â€™s incident was a hoax , those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			2
' in april police warned swatting was becoming a national epidemic after an army of officers stormed a @entity39 home under the belief a teen had shot dead his mother and brother and was ready to kill again			1
within minutes of arriving , they discovered the hostage call was an act of revenge by a disgruntled ' @entity173 ' gamer who 'd just been defeated			0
@entity175 : as mr @entity6 was frisked , his fellow players continued with their game and killed his character aftermath : officers then realised it was a hoax			2
a @entity122 of @entity11 statement said : ' a massive law enforcement response wastes resources and greatly increases the chances of innocent people being injured or killed ' and in @entity188 , @entity40 , an imposter was said to have claimed a 15 - year - old boy would descend on the @entity190 with an @entity192 rifle and body armour			1
the teenager said he believed he was the victim of somebody online ' that does n't like me ... for either me coding , or me playing video games			0
' in april , last year @entity200 reported how @entity202 host @entity201 fell victim to a ' swatting ' prank after @entity206 police got an urgent message saying that someone had been shot at @entity201 's @entity210 home			1
officers set up a perimeter and started advancing on the house before a dispatch supervisor confirmed the message was a fraud			0
@entity201 was not in @entity210 at the time			0
after he was freed , mr @entity6 told his 220,000 @entity52 followers : ' @entity217 nabbit that was dern sure an experience			0
i am all @entity221 though			0
thanks for all the supportive tweets everyone			0
