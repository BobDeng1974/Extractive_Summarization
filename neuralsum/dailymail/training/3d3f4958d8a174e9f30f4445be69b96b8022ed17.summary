by @entity0 @entity1 , 65 , said senior politicians , military figures and even people linked to the @entity5 were among the alleged abusers at least 20 high - profile members of the @entity9 formed a vip paedophile ring that abused children for decades , a whistleblower claimed last night			1
@entity1 , 65 , said senior politicians , military figures and even people linked to the @entity5 were among the alleged abusers			1
the campaigner , who first raised the alarm about prominent individuals engaged in child sex abuse two years ago , said the conspiracy may have been going on for 65 years			1
speaking in public for the first time in 20 years , the former local authority child protection chief said there were still people in power who had been involved in child abuse two decades ago			1
while working in @entity25 and @entity26 , he helped to convict notorious child abuser @entity27 – once one of the country ’s most respected authorities on child care			1
@entity27 , who is now dead , was also a founding member of the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) – which tried to decriminalise sex between children and adults , before he was convicted of importing child abuse images			1
mr @entity1 told police in 2012 that seven boxes of potential evidence about @entity39 were being stored by @entity40 , and that these might contain evidence of further abuse by senior members of the establishment			1
he told the @entity45 : ‘ for the last 30 years – and longer than that – there have been a number of allegations made by survivors that people at the top of very powerful institutions in this country , which include politicians , judges , senior military figures and even people that have links with the @entity5 , have been involved in the abuse of children			1
‘ at the most serious level , we ’re talking about the brutal rape of young boys			0
’ mr @entity1 said the child abusers made up a ‘ small percentage ’ of the @entity9 , but ‘ a slightly larger percentage ’ knew about it but did not report it to the police			1
he said these people ‘ felt that ’ in terms of their own self - interest and self - preservation and for political party reasons , it has been safer for them to cover it up than deal with it			2
’ child abuser @entity27 was once one of the country ¿ s most respected authorities on child care the retired civil servant said he had once tried to blow the whistle with a ‘ very prominent figure ’ in the @entity86 when the party was in opposition , but ‘ nothing came of it ’			1
mr @entity1 also took his concerns to @entity86 mp @entity92 , who then raised the matter in @entity94 two years ago			1
his comments prompted the @entity97 inquiry known as @entity98 , into claims of a paedophile network linked to @entity101			0
speaking on the @entity45 ’s @entity102 , mr @entity1 added : ‘ over many years i ’ve spoken to a considerable number of victims and most recently victims of perhaps the most powerful elite group of paedophiles			1
‘ because the worst part of sexual abuse is the power that powerful people have over them			2
and they do n’t believe that power can ever be broken			0
’ the evidence from @entity40 includes letters between @entity39 , who was a consultant to the @entity117 before he was unmasked , and other suspected paedophiles			1
he welcomed the two inquiries ordered on monday by home secretary @entity121 but said the allegations should have been taken up ‘ a very long time ago ’			1
he said : ‘ at last there is the very real prospect of survivors and victims having justice			0
i believe that there is strong evidence and an awful lot of information that can be converted into evidence if it is investigated properly			0
' there has been an extremely powerful elite , among the highest levels of the political classes , for as long as i have been alive – and i am 65 now			0
‘ there has been sufficient reason to investigate it over and over again – certainly for the last 30 years – and there has always been the block , the cover - up and the collusion to prevent that			2
’ @entity145 , permanent secretary at the @entity146 the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity86 were last night forced to agree to trawl through their records for evidence that party whips covered up historic allegations of child abuse against @entity155			1
a senior civil servant last night insisted all public bodies – including political parties – should carry out a sweep of their documents for any evidence of a conspiracy of silence			0
@entity145 , permanent secretary at the @entity146 , said ‘ all bodies ’ should carry out investigations to see whether they hold files or evidence relevant to a new , wide - ranging inquiry into historic paedophile allegations			2
he told @entity155 on the @entity170 this included the offices of party whips – the senior mps in charge of discipline in political parties			0
his intervention raises the prospect of current and former mps who served as whips being questioned about what they knew of rumours or allegations against colleagues			0
they have long been said to hold ‘ little black books ’ containing damaging information against colleagues they want to control			2
@entity86 , the @entity148 and @entity147 indicated last night that they would co-operate in full			0
this week @entity86 mp @entity190 raised in the @entity192 remarks by the @entity194 mp @entity193 , who was a whip in @entity197 ’s government between 1970 and 1973			0
he said in a 1995 documentary that mps ‘ in trouble ’ would ask the whips ’ office for help when in difficulty			2
mr @entity193 , who died aged 92 in 2008 , claimed he could assist mps with scandals , including those ‘ involving small boys ’ , to exert control over them later and make sure they followed the party line			1
he said : ‘ for anyone with any sense , who was in trouble , would come to the whips and tell them the truth , and say now , “ i ’m in a jam , can you help ? ”			0
‘ we would do everything we can because we would store up @entity224 points			0
that sounds a pretty , pretty nasty reason , but if we could get a chap out of trouble then he will do as we ask forever more			0
’ former conservative chief whip mr @entity197 pioneered the keeping of a ‘ dirt book ’ about @entity155 ’ private lives for his political advantage			2
conservative mp @entity233 suggested there should be checks to ensure that whips ’ offices co-operated with any police inquiries into historic abuse allegations			2
he said a debate in the @entity241 about whether whips ’ notes were personal or government property had led to a new shredding procedure			0
a @entity247 spokesman said : ‘ conservative whips will review their records and co-operate fully			0
’ @entity86 said : ‘ we will do everything in our power to help the inquiry			2
’ the @entity147 said : ‘ we will cooperate with the inquiries in whatever way we can			0
