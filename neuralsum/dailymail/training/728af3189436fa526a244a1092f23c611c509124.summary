this was a point celebrated wildly by the 2,600 @entity3 fans inside the @entity4			1
a shirts off , flag - waving party spurred by trance music blaring from the sound system			0
@entity9 went topless too , chucking his yellow jersey into the crowd along with @entity12 , @entity13 and others			2
usually such scenes of euphoria are reserved for cup final victories and relegation survivals			0
rarely have they been preceded by a 0 - 0 draw			2
but it was understandable , @entity3 had come to the nation ranked fourth in the world , their toughest destination on the road to qualification for @entity27 , and left with their unbeaten record still intact			1
@entity9 throws his shirt into the crowd after helping @entity3 earn a 0 - 0 draw with @entity32 in their @entity27 qualifier @entity3 players huddle together after weathering a @entity32 storm to stay top of @entity37 @entity9 and @entity13 share a joke after maintaining their four - game unbeaten run in qualifying @entity32 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity42 7 ; @entity43 6 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 5 ; @entity49 5 ( @entity50 62 ’ 6 ) , @entity51 6 , hazard 7 ; @entity53 6 ( @entity54 73 ’ ( @entity55 89 ’ ) ) @entity56 6 @entity3 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 : @entity57 7.5 ; @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 8.5 , a @entity12 8 , @entity60 6.5 ; @entity61 7.5 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 5 ( @entity64 46 ’ ) , @entity13 5 ; @entity65 6 ( @entity66 90 ’ ) ; @entity9 7.5 booked : @entity61 , @entity64 , @entity62 , @entity57 @entity67 7 mom : @entity59 referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) player ratings from @entity72 in @entity73 it appeared for a fleeting moment at the death like it was being snatched away , when @entity50 ’s header was saved by @entity57 and caused havoc in the six - yard area			1
@entity47 got a touch to divert the ball towards the @entity83 net but as it rolled @entity9 , of all people , arrived to clear from danger			1
that swing of the boot , in the sixth minute of injury time , was just as important as any he has delivered at the other end of the pitch for his country			0
a star player scrapping it out			0
the lengthy added time came due to @entity54 needing treatment after being knocked out by an accidental collision with @entity100			0
he left on a stretcher only 16 minutes after coming on			0
@entity61 required medical attention earlier in the second half , when @entity48 led a dangerous forearm into his face in a tussle for the ball			1
@entity61 had seemingly irritated the @entity109 midfielder by knocking him down five minutes beforehand			0
lucky for @entity48 the only red came from @entity61 ’s lip , which was still bleeding as the @entity113 player boarded the team coach			2
he played down the incident , as did his manager			0
it will be sore heads of a different kind this morning for those @entity83 fans who crossed the @entity121 , sunk beer in the bars of @entity73 during the day , and continued to do so into the night			2
it really was an immense release of energy from that section of this great bowl of a ground when the final whistle sounded			0
the point was secured by totemic defending from captain @entity12 and @entity131 , who is growing into his role in this team			0
time and again the pair of centre - backs weathered @entity137 attacks , clearing and heading all that came their way			0
it was by no means a @entity137 onslaught , thanks to @entity61 ’s fine work in midfield , and @entity9 went close with two free - kicks and a trademark run and shot			1
@entity67 will be pleased , too , about the nous used at certain moments			2
true , this was not an expansive display but he wants his players to be streetwise when they are unable to show style			0
‘ it 's a fantastic result , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i think we started a bit slow , but in the second half we showed a bit of character and true courage – that ’s massive for us			2
’ his clearance ? ‘ you have to do those things ! everyone will do everything and we all work for each other			0
’ @entity3 now have eight points from four games , the kind of ratio that will get @entity67 ’s side to @entity174 and a first major tournament since 1958			1
@entity9 had the first chance , in the 14th minute , sizing up a free - kick from 25 yards and striking over the wall			1
@entity42 sprang to his left to palm wide			2
@entity32 and @entity3 's star players - @entity181 ( @entity182 ) and @entity9 ( r ) respectively - warm up ahead of the game @entity3 supporters lay a patchwork of flags at the @entity187 , @entity73 @entity9 ( c ) leaps in the air to stretch his muscles as both sides take to the pitch that sparked @entity32 ’s best period			1
@entity181 dribbled through three @entity3 defenders and brought a good save from @entity57			1
the @entity196 goalkeeper , unwanted by @entity197 , made an even better one minutes later , racing from his line to deny @entity199 after @entity201 ’s clever flick set him clear			1
@entity44 then cracked a shot against the post from a corner and as the ball rebounded it hit @entity53 and trickled wide			1
but in the second half @entity32 , @entity207 quarter - finalists last summer , were subdued for long periods and @entity3 had the better chances			1
@entity9 rekindled memories of his 2010 hat - trick in the @entity213 with a run down the left and shot from a tight angle			2
@entity218 then tested @entity42 from range			0
‘ @entity32 have players who can create chances from nothing so we knew we had to ride our luck a little bit , ’ said @entity67			1
‘ but we were stubborn and it was a courageous performance			0
‘ the momentum is there			0
that team in 2002 was a hell of a good team , littered with @entity233 players			1
the front three was ( @entity235 ) @entity234 , ( @entity237 ) @entity236 and ( @entity239 ) @entity238 – that 's not bad – but we never did it			0
’ the challenge now for @entity3 is to make this result worthwhile and give those supporters something seismic to celebrate			0

@entity233 players @entity42 , @entity45 , @entity266 , @entity48 , @entity181 and @entity199 started for @entity32
@entity326 defender @entity44 came closest to opening the scoring after his effort struck the post
@entity9 almost scored with a first - half free - kick and later cleared the ball off the line at the death
a four - game unbeaten start leaves @entity67 's side top of qualifying @entity37
