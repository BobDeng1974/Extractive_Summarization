the @entity7 captain was left out of the starting line - up in their 1 - 0 midweek defeat away at @entity11 , only emerging from the bench in the second half after boss @entity14 sent out something of a second string @entity17 at the @entity18			2
and writing in the @entity19 , @entity0 compared @entity14 ' management of @entity3 with the way sir @entity22 dealt with him during his twilight years at @entity23			1
@entity3 on the bench for @entity1 against @entity11 on tuesday night in the @entity25 the @entity7 captain was left on the sidelines to rest alongside several other @entity1 first team players ' i won a @entity25 final six months before my 34th birthday , ' said @entity0			1
' you need a manager who knows when to play you and when to rest you			0
' sir @entity22 was brilliant at that			2
he would tell me that he had a game in mind for me , a week , 10 days ahead and to get myself ready to play			0
' @entity0 also went on to explain that he believes @entity1 's signings in the summer have not afforded them the opportunity to be able to rotate @entity3 effectively			1

@entity1 's summer signings were not good enough , says @entity0
@entity3 started on the bench against @entity11 on tuesday
@entity14 lacks strength in depth required to rotate @entity3
