@entity0 has responded to new @entity3 super-bantamweight champion @entity2 's challenge by insisting he would relish the chance to settle their rivalry			1
the unbeaten @entity8 pair have been constantly linked with a domestic dust - up as their professional careers have continued to soar in the last few years			1
@entity2 ( 19 - 0 , @entity11 ) raised the stakes over the weekend by defeating @entity13 in his home city of @entity15 to take the @entity17 's world title before saying the ' only man ' he wants to take on next is @entity0			1
bring it on : @entity0 has called for an all - @entity8 showdown with @entity2 impressive : @entity0 retained his @entity24 super-bantamweight title for the third time by beating @entity26 the @entity24 's regular champion will defend his title against late replacement @entity29 in @entity31 on saturday and should he come through that test as expected , @entity0 is keen to take on @entity2 in a unification bout , adding he would be happy to face the @entity34 in his own backyard if it is the best venue			1
' i was pleased to see @entity2 win the title on saturday and now it makes perfect sense for us to fight , ' said the @entity43 fighter			2
' i 'll fight him in @entity15 , no problem - but 9,000 in @entity15 versus 20,000 in @entity31 , it makes more sense to do it there			2
but if they can find somewhere in @entity15 with 20,000 then i can go there , i do n't care			0
i do n't care ! @entity0 insists he will fight @entity2 in his own back yard at @entity15 if he has to fist things first : the reigning @entity24 champion must first fight challenger @entity29 on saturday ' it 's one of the biggest fights in @entity8 boxing , it 's that big , everyone has an opinion			1
' we both think we can win so there 's no reason why we should n't fight - and i know that i will come out with both belts			0
' one sticking point to the bout taking place in the next few months is @entity2 has to face the @entity3 's mandatory challenger @entity64 next , meaning an all - @entity8 showdown may have to be put on the backburner for the time being			1
@entity0 's immediate focus is @entity29 , who came in as a late replacement for @entity70			2
@entity29 has lost two of his last three fights , which included a ninth - round stoppage defeat to @entity74 for the @entity76 bantamweight title , but @entity0 ( 28 - 0 - 2 , @entity77 ) is refusing to look past the @entity78 with more lucrative fights in the pipeline			2
impressive : @entity2 saw off world champion @entity13 to secure the @entity3 super-bantamweight title solid : @entity2 lands an impressive punch on @entity13 during the fight in @entity15 ' @entity29 is a very good fighter , ' he said			1
' he 's only 24 but he 's been around at a good level for a long time			0
' he 's boxed for a world title in @entity87 , he is prepared to travel and travels well , he comes forward and he 's got some good names on his cv			0
he has fallen short at the top level but he would have gained experience from that and will have learned from it			0
' to have a late change of opponent again is a shame			0
we approached nearly every fighter in the division so i give @entity29 plenty of respect for stepping up			0
' boxing always throws up surprises and you have to expect the unexpected , so as long as i am 100 per cent ready , focused and sharp , all i have to do is take care of the guy in the opposite corner , that 's the only thing on my mind			0
