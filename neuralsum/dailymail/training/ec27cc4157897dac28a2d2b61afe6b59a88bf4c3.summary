a collection of surgical equipment that belonged to a @entity3 concentration camp commandant is being put up for auction this week			1
the wooden box of tools belonged to @entity7 , a major in the @entity9 who worked at the @entity12 concentration camp between july 1943 and february 1944 , where 140,000 @entity14 were held - and 33,000 of them died			1
news of the sale has provoked outrage in the @entity14 community			2
@entity20 , chief executive of the @entity21 , the main representative body of @entity23 , said that ' to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling '			1
other @entity14 groups , including the @entity26 and @entity27 , said that the collection should be placed in an educational context , such as a museum			2
@entity12 was used as a propaganda tool during the @entity32 , with the @entity33 trying to fool the world that it was a ' paradise camp '			1
the wooden box of tools belonged to @entity7 , a major in the @entity9 who oversaw the @entity12 concentration camp between july 1943 and february 1944 disturbingly , given the contents of the box , there is no evidence that @entity44 ever received medical training			1
a separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors the case is marked ' instrumente gemischte ' , @entity51 for ' mixed instruments '			2
this has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the @entity57 into thinking it was for musical instruments @entity60 - born @entity7 was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name , eventually dying in @entity33 in 1991 at the age of 80 they even made a film showing happy workers shoeing horses and making handbags , while children played football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception			1
@entity7 played a key role in covering up the true horrors of the camp during stage - managed visits by the @entity57 - which were used to help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the watching world			1
disturbingly , given the contents of the box , there is no evidence that @entity44 ever received medical training			1
the mostly monogrammed equipment - which has a guide price of £ 2,000 to £ 4,000 - has been put up for sale at a small auction house in @entity91 , @entity92 , by an anonymous seller			0
@entity94 , from @entity95 , explained that the husband of the vendor was @entity14 , and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in @entity60			1
ms @entity94 said : ' this set was always in their home while they were married			0
' he would n't talk about his history but he used to spend a lot of time researching the @entity32			0
' the vendor 's husband passed away some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know how he came to own the instruments			0
ms @entity94 added : ' the father [ of the vendor 's husband ] used to deal during the war in the black market so we do n't know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came through the black market somehow , ' she said			2
' it is something we are never going to know			0
' @entity12 , near what is now the town of @entity12 in the @entity127 , acted as a ghetto for 140,000 jews , with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as @entity133 and murdered @entity134 , executive director of the @entity136 @entity135 ' inexplicably there are those who have a grotesque fascination with @entity3 memorabilia and instruments used to inflict suffering on innocent adults and children			1
' i therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or academic institution that will use it for educational purposes			0
' @entity20 , chief executive of the @entity21 ' there is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent history , and along with the countless books and films on the subject , from time to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the @entity161			2
' these things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened , and incontrovertibly show the claims of @entity161 deniers for the lies that they are			0
' however , to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects , and to risk that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the @entity173 , is deeply troubling			1
a more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical archive somewhere			0
' @entity177 , chief executive of the @entity27 ' wherever possible we believe @entity161 - era items should be presented in an educational context , so that as many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling time			0
' the camp , near what is now the town of @entity12 in the @entity127 , acted as a ghetto for 140,000 jews , with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as @entity133 and murdered			1
just 1,900 were still alive when the ghetto was liberated by @entity196 troops on may 7 , 1945			0
@entity7 was ordered by @entity9 leader @entity197 and @entity198 , the orchestrator of the mass movement of @entity14 to camps in @entity202 , to change the appearance of @entity12 to fool @entity57 members who had requested access to a @entity3 concentration camp			1
many inmates were temporarily removed from the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors			2
fake shops and cafes were erected to give the false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort			0
the @entity57 representatives seemed to fall for the deception and the @entity173 went on to make a propaganda film at the camp			2
the fact that the wooden instrument case is marked ' instrumente gemischte ' , @entity51 for ' mixed instruments ' , has led to the theory that this may have been made as part of the deception , to suggest it was for musical instruments			0
' @entity7 was charged with changing the appearance of the camp , and a lot of the @entity14 there were musical so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case , ' ms @entity94 said			1
@entity60 - born @entity7 was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name , eventually dying in @entity33 in 1991 at the age of 80			2
@entity240 from @entity241 holds the macabre box , which was expected to fetch £ 2,000 - £ 4,000 it was only three years after his death , in 1994 , that anyone found out who the dead man really was			0
ms @entity94 said that the auction house was aware of the sensitive nature of selling an item that once belonged to a @entity3 war criminal			0
museums and other institutions across the world have already shown an interest in the sale and ms @entity94 said they hoped it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive , educational setting			0
