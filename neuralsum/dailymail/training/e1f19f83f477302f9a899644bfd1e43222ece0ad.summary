by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:43 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 5 august 2013 cash : @entity3 chief secretary to the treasury is accused of funneling money towards his @entity6 constituency the @entity3 minister in charge of the government ’s spending cuts is accused of funnelling millions of pounds to pet schemes in his own constituency			1
@entity12 faces claims he is shoring up votes in his @entity6 seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere			1
@entity18 claimed there was something ‘ very fishy indeed ’ about the number of expensive schemes and tax breaks which benefit mr @entity12 ’s ‘ backyard ’			1
since may 2010 several specific projects have received extra money for mr @entity12 ’s @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 & @entity31 constituency			0
as chief secretary to the treasury , he is effectively @entity33 ’s deputy and responsible for signing off all government spending			1
in an apparent admission that money is being redirected to northern @entity37 , a senior @entity3 told the ft : ‘ this is the pay - off			1
@entity12 is loyal to @entity33 , and this is what he gets in return			2
’ cash secured for his seat includes a tax break for ski - lifts , a bail - out for a sleeper train from @entity50 to @entity37 and more money to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council , the @entity43 said			1
just last week the government announced extra funding to help councils cope with the fall out of changes to housing benefit rules , which mean some people will lose money if they have spare bedrooms			2
the cash is supposed to help some people who might be affected by the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’			2
but @entity66 , where all three mps are @entity3 including mr @entity12 , received £ 735,000 – 80 per cent more than the next highest @entity68 which received £ 412,000			2
in total @entity66 received 15 per cent of the entire pot available to 21 local authorities			0
deputy council leader @entity71 credited meetings with mr @entity12 for securing the money			2
cool deals : ski lifts in @entity76 of the @entity6 have seen their vat rate cut to just 5 per cent while the @entity79 mountain railway which runs for two kilometers through the @entity76 ski area has been exempted from the climate change levy also last week mr @entity12 unveiled plans to extend a fuel rebate currently only available to people living on islands to include remote rural areas , including the @entity6			1
@entity87 , @entity18 ’s shadow treasury minister , said : ‘ this is very fishy indeed			1
it seems to be more than a coincidence that , at a time of austerity , funding has gone from the @entity94 to so many specific projects that just happen to benefit @entity12 ’s constituency			0
‘ the chief secretary seems to be happy pushing through deep tax rises and spending cuts across the rest of the country , so long as his backyard is protected , ’ he told the @entity43 ‘ when everyone else is paying higher vat , is it really a priority to give a big vat cut to ski - lift operators ? , ’ mr @entity87 added			1
critics have likened the spending to pork barrel politics			1
but challenged over the claims last month , mr @entity12 told @entity114 magazine : ' i ’m an mp from the @entity6 , that ’s true			0
i ’m the first highlander to occupy cabinet office for several generations			0
' i think that the fact that for the first time in several generations someone at the top of @entity122 has had an understanding of one of the most fragile areas of this country is a good thing			0
' that is what gives me insights into issues that are important			0
' however , the list of specific projects in his seat which appear to have benefited from special treatment is long and growing			1
in january it was announced that £ 50million of @entity141 government money had been found to help pay for the refurbishment of the @entity144 , which terminates in @entity27			0
at the time mr @entity12 boasted of ‘ having worked hard to deliver £ 50m of @entity141 government support ’ , adding : ‘ as someone who uses that route i am looking forward to the excellent staff service being matched by facilities which will make enhance the trip and make the @entity50 sleeper an experience to savour			0
’ travel perks : the @entity144 , which terminates in mr @entity12 's constituency , received £ 50million from the government and last week it was announced a fuel rebate for @entity141 islands could be extended to remote rural areas , including the @entity6 the budget in 2012 was dominated by rows over taxes on pasties and caravans			0
but it also included a vat cut for ski lifts , to just five per cent , which caused mr @entity12 to boast : ‘ @entity79 has some of the finest snowsports and outdoor facilities in the @entity141 and hopefully this will help the resort maintain its vital role in our economy here in @entity31			1
’ in 2011 a tourist train running up the @entity76 mountain received a tax break , when the @entity94 exempted any ‘ non-public service rail operators ’ from the climate change levy			0
however , it is thought that the @entity76 tourist train was the only project which could qualify			0
a spokesman for mr @entity12 said : ‘ @entity3 are working hard to make sure this government governs for the whole country and is the first for many years to take rural areas seriously			2
' it is right that the government recognises the significant challenges for those living in rural communities up and down the country and does what it can to support them			0
' this is in addition to the practical help we are delivering for everyone in @entity141 through the largest income tax cuts in a generation , freezes in fuel duty and freezes in council tax			2

chief secretary to the treasury is in charge of spending cuts
critics accuse him of pork barrel politics to secure cash for his seat
ski lifts , a sleeper train and council funding have all benefited
@entity18 says the list of schemes is ' very fishy indeed '
@entity3 source says it is the ' pay - off ' for being @entity33 's deputy
