but @entity0 ’s 13th - century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather			1
the leader of the @entity18 armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity11			0
historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak , cold and dry @entity27 plains for warmer regions			1
but now scientists have discovered that the rise of the @entity3 coincided with a 14 - year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years			1
the academics , from @entity34 in @entity35 , discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees			1
they think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass , which would have fuelled the soldiers ' horses and fattened their livestock			1
the good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when @entity0 and his armies rose to prominence			1
@entity52 , co-author of the study published in the journal @entity55 , said : ‘ the transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events			0
‘ it was n’t the only thing , but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos , develop an army and concentrate power			0
‘ where it ’s arid , unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity , and that translates into horsepower			0
@entity0 was literally able to ride that wave			1
’ researchers analysed 17 trees found in the @entity76 in @entity27 , marked at @entity77 , to chart a yearly record of rainfall back to 658 ad			1
they claim that due to the warm and wet weather during @entity0 ' reign , there would have been an unusual increase in grass production , which would have fuelled a boom in livestock statue of @entity0 in the @entity88 , @entity27			1
originally known as @entity90 , legend has it @entity0 was born holding a clot of blood in his hand			1
his father was @entity0 , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when @entity0 was still young			2
@entity0 conquered almost four times the lands of @entity99 before @entity0 rose to power the @entity18 tribes had been racked by disarray and internal warfare			2
in the early 1200s he united the tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern @entity107 , @entity20 , @entity22 , eastern @entity11 , southeast @entity10 , @entity108 and @entity21			0
@entity0 made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations			2
he was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his territories			0
some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants alive today			0
@entity0 was the founder and @entity118 of the @entity3			1

originally known as @entity130 , legend has it @entity0 was born holding a clot of blood in his hand			2
his father was @entity0 , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when @entity130 was still young			2
the new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with @entity0 's family , so with his mother and five other children , @entity130 was cast out and left to die			2
in all , @entity0 conquered almost four times the lands of @entity99			2
he is still revered in @entity27 and in parts of @entity20			2
the empire eventually fragmented , but the @entity3 ’ vast geographic reach and their inventions survived			0
their ideas included an international postal system , organized agriculture research and a civil service based on merit			0
@entity153 , who co-wrote the paper , said : ‘ before fossil fuels , grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the @entity3 and the cultures around them			1
‘ energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem , up the ladder to human society			0
@entity0 was the founder and @entity118 of the @entity3 , pictured			1
after he united nomadic tribes in @entity10 he founded the @entity3 and began invading the rest of the continent of @entity169			0
by the time he died in august 1227 , the @entity3 covered a vast part of @entity10 and @entity20 ‘ even today , many people in @entity27 live just like their ancestors did			1
’ the researchers said the trees , some of them more than 1,000 years old , gave them an indication of what the future could hold for the region , with drought and other extreme weather likely to become more common in central @entity10			1
‘ this last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future , not just in @entity27 but in a lot of inner @entity10 , ’ said mr @entity153			0
‘ the heat is a double whammy - even if rainfall does n't change , the landscape is going to get drier			0
’ other historical events that studies say were affected by climate include the disappearance of the @entity196 , the expansion and fall of @entity199 imperial power and the 13th - century collapse of south east @entity10 's @entity202 civilisation .			0

researchers from @entity205 analysed trees in the @entity76
using tree - rings they were able to chart yearly rainfall back to 658 ad
between 1211 and 1225 - the exact time of the @entity3 ' rise - central @entity27 saw one of its wettest , and warmest , periods for 1,000 years
researchers claim this weather caused an increase in grass production
this in turn created a boom in yaks , cattle , sheep and other livestock
this would have enabled @entity0 to ' travel with a mobile meat supply '
