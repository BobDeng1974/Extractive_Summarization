@entity0 has revealed that the @entity2 squad want to win the @entity3 as a ‘ thank you ’ to manager @entity5 , who has yet to win @entity7 ’s biggest club prize in his 31 - year managerial career			1
@entity5 reached the @entity3 semi-final with @entity10 in 1994 and the 2006 final , when 10 - man @entity2 led @entity13 1 - 0 after having @entity14 sent off , before conceding two late goals to lose 2 - 1			1
despite qualifying for the tournament a record 17 consecutive years in a row with @entity2 , @entity5 has never won it			2
instead he has watched his great rivals sir @entity20 and @entity21 pick up the trophy twice , while @entity23 won the trophy with @entity25 at his first attempt in 2012 and @entity27 won it twice within three years of taking up management			0
like our @entity2 @entity30 page @entity0 says @entity2 want to win the @entity3 for manager @entity5 @entity0 scores past @entity32 during @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity34 on saturday and @entity0 says that the @entity2 team want to set the record straight for @entity5			1
‘ for him , that would be the icing on the cake if you like , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ he has been 17 years and had one final — he came close to winning that , he was unlucky , he had @entity14 sent off — so i think this is the one he really , really wants , as well as the @entity44 , because he wants it for us			0
but if he gives the @entity3 to us it will also be like a present [ from us ] to him if we win the @entity3			2
’ @entity2 start their campaign at 2013 finalists @entity51 on tuesday , a fixture which has become familiar in recent years , with the teams being drawn together in 2011 and 2013 , with @entity2 recording an impressive 1 - 0 win in @entity51 but losing a 2 - 1 at the @entity55 , a result which cost them top spot in the group			1
@entity5 is yet to win the @entity3 during his long managerial career @entity0 said : ‘ between us two , they are always good games and they will be thinking the same			1
they wo n’t want to be coming to us again even though they won here last year , we won there			0
it is a tough game and we go there first and it ’s almost like the @entity65 game against @entity66 if you like ; the hardest game in the group will be the first one and we can almost put a marker down in that game by saying we ’re here to win this group			2
‘ i think that ’s the target at the start			0
over the last few seasons we almost thought we were finishing top and we lost the last game and it has cost us			0
‘ we have really been unlucky with the draw over the last few years , with @entity85 twice , they ’re the best team in @entity7 for me , so we could have had anyone else and had a little bit more of a chance of going through , but , as you said , it is really important to finish top of the group			0
’ @entity93 collects his medal after @entity2 were beaten by @entity13 in the 2006 @entity3 final @entity14 was sent off in @entity96 , and @entity2 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity13			1
