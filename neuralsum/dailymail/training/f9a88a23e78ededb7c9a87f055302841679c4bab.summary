while fish is a good source of protein , @entity20 warns people should only consume some species like shark , marlin , broadbill and swordfish no more than once a week due to higher levels of mercury			1
eating too much shark meat in fish and chips may be harmful to a person 's health due to the high level of mercury in some species , a new study by the @entity9 has found pregnant women should limit consumption to once a fortnight , the website advises			1
analysis of shark tissue in the study found the two highest concentrations of mercury showed two 120g servings of dusky and sandbar shark would exceed the food standard 's recommendations for weekly mercury level intake , the @entity41 reports			2
the report revealed about 75 percent of samples from dusky sharks and 58 percent from the sandbar surpassed the food standard 's mercury limit			0

' sharks store mercury and arsenic from species they hunt , according to @entity106 , an associate professor at the @entity107 of the @entity108 and co-author of the report			0
she said while additional research was needed to reveal the toxicity of arsenic found in shark fins , food preparation was unlikely to reduce high concentrations			2
' the large males of the species are the ones to avoid in terms of accumulation , ' dr @entity106 said			0
