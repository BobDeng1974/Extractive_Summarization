by @entity0 a militant @entity2 campaigner caused controversy when she likened the plight of livestock to that of the @entity7 in the @entity8 the @entity2 has been plunged into fresh controversy after a militant campaigner seeking election to its ruling council likened the plight of livestock to that of @entity7 in the @entity8			1
@entity16 , 61 , is one of six candidates fighting to fill five vacancies on the charity ’s council , which contributes to its ‘ effective leadership and direction ’			1
the vote is pivotal for the @entity2 ’s future because the council intends to appoint a new chief executive early next year to replace the combative @entity27 , who resigned because of poor health			2
his tenure saw the charity at war with farms and hunters , while the number of prosecutions it launched almost doubled – leading to accusations the charity was overzealous and politically and financially motivated			2
mrs @entity16 said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people ’s health , welfare and psychology			1
she told @entity47 : ‘ i do n’t think people always appreciate what is the holocaust going on behind closed doors			0
you talk about the @entity7			1
this probably sounds like animal rights , but if you recognise animals as sentient beings , why are we treating them so abysmally on farms ? ’ the comments drew condemnation from countryside campaigners and @entity7 groups , who branded the comparison ‘ offensive ’ and accused her of ‘ trivialising ’ the suffering of millions			1
mrs @entity16 , who lives in @entity64 , @entity65 , has already urged the @entity2 to drop @entity66 , the accreditation programme promoting higher farm welfare standards which is backed by the chef @entity68			1
she says the money should be spent on prosecuting farmers and , if elected , she would like the @entity2 to encourage the public to ‘ follow a wholly plant - based diet ’			0
she supports @entity73 , a sanctuary for animals ‘ rescued from the farming industry ’ and wants to ban the @entity77			0
@entity78 , director of the @entity79 , said : ‘ no one who fully understands the all - encompassing evil of the @entity8 , and its systematic programme of genocide , could ever seriously compare it to the treatment – no matter how bad – of farm animals			2
‘ while everyone is entitled to their own views about the morality and efficiency of how we source our food , that can never be an acceptable reason to trivialise the memory of the millions of @entity7 and others who were deliberately exterminated by the @entity100 regime			2
’ @entity101 , of the @entity102 , added : ‘ this is the language of extremists which would be offensive to anyone who is n’t obsessed with an animal rights agenda – particularly those who lived and suffered through the @entity8			1
in her controversial rant , @entity108 , 61 , also said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people ¿ s health , welfare and psychology ' a creeping political and animal rights agenda has been apparent in the @entity2 for a number of years now and further moves towards militancy are not going to improve its image to the public			2
’ another candidate , @entity123 , also supports @entity73 and was nominated by @entity124			0
mr @entity123 helped to persuade the charity to withdraw from @entity126 because of concerns about pedigree dog breeding			0
one candidate seen as a moderate voice is @entity131 , the charity ’s former chief vet and an adviser on dog - breeding legislation aimed at reducing the number of irresponsibly bred puppies			0
asked about the effect of electing mrs @entity16 and mr @entity123 , mr @entity131 said : ‘ every time there is an election , we change the balance of the council			1
if those two were elected and i was not , that clearly would make a difference			0
’ polling results for the unpaid positions are due to be announced at a charity meeting this month			0
in december , the @entity2 hired a lawyer to carry out a £ 50,000 review of its controversial prosecutions policy following months of criticism , including its decision to bring a £ 330,000 private prosecution against the @entity155 in @entity158 ’s @entity157 constituency .			0
