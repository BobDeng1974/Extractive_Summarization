by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor giving schoolchildren hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra @entity7 and maths lessons , @entity2 claimed today			1
the deputy prime minister said it was not surprising that children with packed lunches consisting of ' a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink ' struggled to concentrate			0
he hailed a scheme offering almost 2million children aged under - 7 who will be given free school meals which begins today			1
mr @entity2 insists offering free meals to all pupils , not just those from low income families , will make them healthier and improve academic attainment			1
he told @entity39 's today programme : ' the evidence , and this has been exhaustively analysed , piloted , examined , is that giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as , if not more , effective than many of the , say , literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom			0
it has a dramatic effect			0
' mr @entity2 today visited a school in @entity22 to launch the free meals scheme			2
he added : ' the evidence quite simply shows that this not only has a dramatic effect on those four in ten children who are in poverty but presently do n't receive free school meals , the evidence also shows it 's a great help to household budgets			2
' it helps families save £ 400 per child for meal costs every year , but in the school where we piloted this ... the children who were receiving a healthy meal at lunchtime are generally doing better - two months in advance in @entity7 and maths compared to their classmates			1
' if you have children , and this does unfortunately happen , who turn up with a lunch box with a slice of white bread with some chocolate spread in it and a fizzy drink , it 's not surprising they do n't concentrate well in the afternoon			0
' he insisted that providing lunch for every five to seven - year - old at @entity7 's 16,500 primary schools will be more beneficial than some attempts to boost academic achievements			0
as the programme was launched , mr @entity2 vowed not to let critics ' cloud ' his goal of creating a level playing field for all children , adding that the scheme is ' one of the most progressive changes to our school system for a long time '			2
the offer of free school meals for all infant pupils in @entity7 was announced by mr @entity2 at last year 's @entity33 conference , at a cost of £ 600million a year			1
mr @entity2 argued the policy would improve children 's health and academic attainment , and help parents struggling with the cost of food from this month an extra 1.89million children will qualify for the meals , regardless of their parents ' income			1
it is expected to save even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child			1
but the policy has caused huge rows in the coalition , with @entity33 accusing @entity125 @entity124 of ' lying ' about its implementation			0
mr @entity2 was forced to announce an extra £ 150million to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand			2
the @entity131 survey of 75 councils found that nearly half ( 47 per cent ) said they had not received enough money from the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) to cover the full cost of the work they needed to do to ensure that schools in their area were ready to provide universal free meals for infants			0
the policy is expected to save even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child councils have complained that they have struggled to find the money to expand kitchens and dining halls to implement the policy the shortfall across those councils that responded totals around £ 25.9 million , the association estimated			1
of those that said that they did not have enough money , 49 per cent said that the council would help to make up the difference , with just over a third ( 37 per cent ) saying at least some of the cash would come from school funds			0
authorities had also reported that money could be taken from general school funding intended for school repairs and maintenance , the association said			0
the @entity131 said it had calculated that councils without enough money for the scheme have had to find an estimated £ 488,000 on average to ensure that pupils will get the meals they will be entitled to			0
it added that some schools will give pupils packed lunches and others will use portable kitchens to ensure they can offer the free lunches when the new school year starts , and work will continue on options for providing hot meals .			1

1.89million under - sevens to get free school lunches from this week
policy for *reception* , years one and two will save families up to £ 400 per year
@entity2 argues it will improve health and attainment of all young pupils
