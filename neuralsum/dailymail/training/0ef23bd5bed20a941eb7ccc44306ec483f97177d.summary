traces of deodorant , perfume and soap left behind at crime scenes could soon be used by police to help trap criminals			1
forensics experts are building chemical profiles of popular fragrances to help them identify scents left on clothing and items touched by offenders			1
they hope that by building up a ' scent profile ' of the person behind a crime , it can help to narrow down lists of suspects and even be used as evidence in court			1
forensics experts are building chemical profiles of popular fragrances in a lab ( pictured ) to help them identify scents left on clothing and items touched by offenders			1
they hope that by building up a ' scent profile ' of the person behind a crime , it can help to narrow down lists of suspects and even be used as evidence in court @entity31 , a researcher at @entity33 's department of forensic and crime science , is leading the work in the hope that it can be used by police forensics teams			1
she said : ' suspects can be smothered in fragrance and i am trying to find chemicals that can give some extra information			0
' you can get quite a complex mixture of different personal care products that can be used together to narrow down a list of suspects or build up a picture of a perpetrator			2
' for example , @entity50 is famous for using a particular aldehyde , so if i can see components that are typical of @entity55 it might be possible to say a suspect comes from a certain socio - economic background			1
similarly @entity58 tends to be used by younger men			1
experts from @entity33 said there is a complex mixture of different personal care products that can be used together to narrow down a list of suspects			2
for example , @entity50 5 ( left ) uses a particular aldehyde and could reveal details of a person 's @entity68 ( right ) tends to be used by younger men lead researcher @entity31 said : ' scent evidence is never going to be as robust as dna evidence , but you can get something a lot quicker and cheaper than you can with @entity71			1
used together with other forensic methods it can be another piece of evidence in the puzzle - it is another tool in the toolbox ' ' if we were to see some @entity83 fragrances in there too , for example , then we can start to unpick a bit about who they are			1
' mrs @entity31 , who presented her findings to a recent meeting of the @entity91 , is attempting to develop the technique so it can be submitted as robust evidence in court			2
she said samples of scents can be easily gathered from the clothing of victims or from swabs taken off hard surfaces			0
these can then be analysed in the laboratory for chemical signatures that match those found in beauty and personal hygiene products			0
sniffer dogs have been used by police in criminal investigations for decades and are often able to identify individuals from their scent even if they have changed soaps			2
forensic scientists have been attempting to replicate this by using electronic equipment that can analyse the chemical components of an odour			0
they hope that by identify key compounds from the sweat left behind by criminals , it can be used as evidence against them			1
they also hope that chemical markers in the sweat could also be used to build up lifestyle profiles of suspects , indicating whether they smoke , their diet , sex and even emotional state			1
professor @entity133 , from @entity135 's @entity134 , has been helping to develop a way of identifying individuals from their scent by looking at 44 compounds secreted by the human body			0
another team at the @entity141 , working with @entity142 , has developed a new technique for analysing odour given off in sweat , that they hope will lead to handheld devices			0
' i am concentrating on what compounds we can detect and what might be significant , ' she continued			0
' ultimately i am not really interested in whether the samples we get actually smell or not - i 'm looking for the chemical patterns to see if they can be matched with anything			0
' scent evidence is never going to be as robust as dna evidence , but you can get something a lot quicker and cheaper than you can with @entity71			2

dr @entity205 , who led the work which is published in the @entity207 and @entity208 , said : ' we have demonstrated a viable technology for fast , cheap , all - electronic analysis of known odor profiles			0
' humans emit a variety of volatile organic compounds in urine , sweat and other bodily fluids			0
' techniques to quantitatively analyze volatile organic compound profiles in sweat and other bodily fluids could find applications in disease diagnostics , health and wellbeing monitoring , and even for detection , identification or tracking of individuals			0
