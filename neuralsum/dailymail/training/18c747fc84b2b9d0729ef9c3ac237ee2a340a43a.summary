by @entity0 , @entity1 click here to read our chief sports writer 's debate column on @entity7 's nasty strain of anti-semitic @entity9 posturing @entity7 's hopes of pointing to the support of a prominent member of the @entity14 jewish community in a bid to clear his name have received another blow			1
@entity18 striker @entity7 is facing a minimum five - match ban for his ' quenelle ' salute , unless he can prove his case , after being charged by the @entity23 with performing the allegedly anti-semitic gesture after scoring against @entity25 on december 28			1
the 34 - year - old has until 6pm on thursday to formally reply to the charge , which he appears certain to contest as he insists he is neither anti-semitic nor racist			1
bad move : @entity7 could bring a premature end to his career if he decides to challenge the @entity23 @entity7 , however , believed he had the backing of a jewish community leader in the battle to clear his name			1
@entity35 , the president of @entity36 ( representative @entity37 in @entity14 ) , initially appeared to side with @entity7 in an interview with @entity40			2
the quenelle has been described as an inverted @entity9 salute and was created by @entity14 comedian @entity43 , who has been prosecuted for @entity44			1
@entity7 is a friend of @entity43 's , and the player has insisted his salute was a gesture aimed at the @entity14 establishment			1
@entity35 said in a video interview with @entity40 the quenelle could not be regarded as anti-semitic in the context it was performed in			0
sparking controversy : @entity7 celebrated with a quenelle gesture after he scored against @entity25 the @entity14 comedian at the heart of the storm surrounding @entity7 ’s controversial ‘ quenelle ’ gesture has stated he is fully supportive of his “ brother in humanity ”			1
@entity62 , who has been prosecuted for @entity44 , created the quenelle that has been described as an inverted @entity64 to @entity65 , @entity43 is firmly behind @entity7 as he said : “ @entity7 has all my support , that ’s evident			1
“ i consider him a brother in humanity			0
he ’s someone who is very courageous and for whom i have much respect and admiration			0
“ @entity7 is a descendant of slaves and if he wants to remark on this history then he has the right to - and we are all very proud of him for doing so			2
” that prompted @entity7 to write in a statement on his @entity79 page : " i therefore ask the @entity23 to kindly remove the charge made against me			1
and i repeat , i am not anti-semitic or racist			0
" in the video , @entity35 said the gesture only had anti-semitic connotations if made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the @entity87			0
but in a statement on the @entity36 website , @entity35 has clarified his earlier views , and made clear @entity7 's actions were disappointing			0
' the ' quenelle ' is a @entity9 salute reversed , there 's no doubt in my mind because this is the will of the one who created and popularised it for purely ideological ends , ' said @entity35			0
' my statements in @entity40 are no denial or renunciation on this subject , despite the interpretations that were made			0
' however , i wished , perhaps too quickly , to demonstrate that it was important to show discernment , restraint , to avoid being drawn into a spiral that was difficult to control			0
' it is clear the gesture of the ' quenelle ' has dangerously spread among our citizens and especially youth			2
under fire : the @entity14 , ahead of @entity18 's game against @entity118 on monday ( right ) , faces a lengthy ban ' they do n't realise the severity and scope			2
they are doing this gesture for provocation rather than anti-semitism , at least i hope so			0
' should we be hard on them ? definitely , as it glorifies crime against humanity , but we must also teach the youth who are manipulated by @entity43 and his followers			0
' it is up to teachers to do that , but also public figures from the worlds of culture and sport			0
' this is why i was disappointed with the attitude of @entity7 whose behaviour is the opposite of what a top athlete must show the youth of our country			1
' i was troubled by the fact the public man he is - a symbol for some of the youth of our country and so must therefore be perfect in his behaviour - can make this gesture " to show his friendship to his friend @entity43 " , whose motivations are without a doubt anti-semitic			1
' defiant : a group perform the ' quenelle ' gesture in @entity14 earlier this month when @entity18 striker @entity7 scored the first of his two goals in december 's 3 - 3 @entity170 draw at @entity25 , he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of @entity174 football			1
but the salute , known in @entity14 as ' la quenelle ' , is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the @entity14 interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across @entity7 's homeland			2
here , we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self - proclaimed inventor , the stand - up comedian and political activist @entity43 :			2
