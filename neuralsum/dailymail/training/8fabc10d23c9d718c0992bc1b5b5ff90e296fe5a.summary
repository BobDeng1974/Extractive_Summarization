last updated at 2:59 pm on 5th december 2011 passions run high : an @entity3 employee with the company 's logo shaved in his hair - today , the company lost one round in its copyright battle with @entity10 , as @entity10 won the rights to sell @entity13 tablets in @entity14 @entity10 has won the most important round yet in its global legal battle with @entity3 - after the @entity19 company 's bid to halt @entity21 sales of @entity10 's @entity13 products was rejected			1
the companies are embroiled in bitter patent disputes in 10 countries - but none is more important than the @entity21 , @entity10 's biggest market			1
the victory comes in the wake of an @entity14 court 's ruling that @entity10 was free to sell its @entity13 tablets in that territory			1
shares in @entity10 rose more than 2 percent			1
@entity10 surpassed @entity3 as the world ’s top smartphone maker in the third quarter and a ruling to temporarily halt @entity21 sales of @entity13 smartphones could have negatively affected its growth momentum just as @entity3 released the @entity42 in early october			1
' we believe the legal uncertainties between @entity10 and @entity3 are waning , or put in another way , the situation is turning positive for @entity10 , ' said @entity48 analyst @entity47			1
@entity50 analysts said the ruling removed the worst - case scenario for @entity10 ’s operating profit of a hit of as much as $ 1.5 billion and was ' clearly a major and favourable event ' for the company			1
the battle has only intensified as sales of @entity10 's cult @entity13 handsets have bitten into @entity3 's market share			1
@entity10 is now the biggest smartphone company on @entity62 , by revenue and by volume , beating both @entity65 and @entity3			2
@entity67 phones now account for 52.5 per cent of the smartphone market - and @entity3 's just 16.6			0
but its @entity69 is n't going to have an easy ride , even if it does go on sale - both @entity13 and ipad 2 are now being aggressively undercut by @entity75 's new @entity74 tablet , which is roughly half the price of either			1
the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity14 : a dispute between @entity3 and @entity10 has erupted over @entity10 's @entity80 10.1 tablet a @entity10 store in @entity78 : customers will be free to buy @entity13 tablets from friday afternoon - unless @entity3 appeals the court 's decisions fire has remained @entity75 's best - selling item for eight weeks running			1
at least one major @entity21 retailer said it outsold @entity90 2 on @entity91 , the post-thanksgiving shopping bonanza seen as ' kicking off ' the shopping season in @entity21			2
' it ’s hard to expect the ruling to have a major positive impact on @entity10 ’s tablet business or legal cases in other countries as @entity3 could appeal - and sales wo n’t be restored anytime soon , ' said @entity101 - sub , an analyst at @entity102 in @entity103			1
a @entity104 on display in @entity103 : despite the @entity14 ruling , legal battle still rages between the two companies and @entity3 is to sue for a @entity110 ban on december 22 ' @entity3 will continue to dominate the tablet market as @entity112 to be the only viable threat at the moment and other vendors , including @entity10 , continue to struggle			2
' @entity3 's move to win a stay preventing @entity3 selling the devices may allow it to lodge an appeal			0
the ruling is , however , a timely boost for @entity10 ahead of the busy pre-christmas shopping season			2
while the @entity14 market is not large , it is a key launch market for @entity3 products outside the @entity21			2
@entity3 and @entity10 have been locked in a battle in 10 countries involving smartphones and tablets since april			2
at one point , @entity3 forced @entity10 to withdraw its @entity13 tablet from a technology trade show where it was not even on sale			1
@entity10 has attempted to ban @entity42 in several territories			0
the @entity14 dispute centres on touchscreen technology used in @entity10 ’s new tablet			0
the quarrel had triggered expectations that some of the pair ’s $ 5 billion - plus relationship may be up for grabs			0
@entity10 openly describes @entity3 as its ' biggest customer '			0
ironically , the @entity146 chip in both @entity90 2 and @entity42 still seems to be made by @entity10			0
@entity3 was granted an injunction against @entity10 in october , temporarily barring @entity14 sales of the @entity13 10.1 tab , which had been seen as the hottest competitor to @entity3 ’s @entity90 until @entity75 launched its @entity74			1
@entity75 said this week it saw a surge in sales of its tablet devices on the crucial “ @entity91 ” shopping day after @entity155			0
@entity10 is the world ’s top smartphone maker , but a distant second to @entity3 in tablets			0
the intensifying legal battle has undermined its efforts to close the gap			0
@entity3 also filed a preliminary injunction request in @entity164 on monday to ban sales of the @entity166 , a re-designed version of 10.1 - inch @entity13 model , whose sales are already banned in that market			0
' we believe the ( @entity14 ) ruling clearly affirms that @entity3 ’s legal claims lack merit , ' @entity10 said in a statement , adding it would soon make an announcement on the market availability of the @entity104 in @entity14			0
justice @entity178 told the court he would grant a stay on orders until friday 4 p.m. ( 0500 gmt ) , noting @entity3 would have to go to the @entity183 if it wanted this extended			0
copyright experts have been aghast at some of the issues raised - claiming that some of the legal measures used by the companies could result in bans of other devices , or even whole classes of technology .			0
