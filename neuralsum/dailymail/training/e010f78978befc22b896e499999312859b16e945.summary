by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 27 december 2012 a motorist has won a six - month legal battle after he was fined over a £ 1 parking fee			2
@entity4 , 56 , parked by a @entity6 store but was unaware he was liable to pay the £ 1 charge because the sign was obscured by a pillar			1
after returning to his vehicle to find a £ 50 penalty notice , he scoured the car park and eventually saw a blue sign on a wall at ground level , reading : ‘ this is a pay and display car park			1
’ he then sent photographic evidence of the hidden sign and a cheque for the £ 1 charge to @entity22 and appealed against his fine			1
@entity4 , 56 , parked by a @entity6 store but was unaware he was liable to pay the £ 1 charge because the sign was obscured by a pillar on much closer inspection the sign was tucked away behind a height barrier but the council rejected his appeal and he had to attend a @entity32 in @entity33 – to which the council sent two officials and submitted a 74 - page dossier			1
adjudicator @entity37 cancelled the parking ticket and ruled the signage was ‘ inadequate ’			0
mr @entity4 said his battle had cost him far more than the £ 50 fine but he had contested it as ‘ a point of principle ’			1
declining to specify the financial loss he suffered in terms of lost time , he pointed out the ‘ sheer cost ’ to the public of the council ’s campaign			2
he said : ‘ besides a mass of paperwork for the council defence , the council sent out someone to take their own photographs			0
‘ all this for a missed £ 1 parking payment which i sent a cheque for on the same day in retrospect , which the council returned and insisted on fining me			2
’ mr @entity4 had parked at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity22 , while he attended a brief meeting			1
he assumed it was free because the area was signposted as ‘ @entity6 parking ’			0
mr @entity4 , who has now won his case , said his battle had cost him far more than the £ 50 fine but he had contested it as ' a point of principle ' but when he returned to find a penalty ticket on his car he searched for signs stating that it was a pay and display car park			1
when he eventually found the small blue sign he photographed both it and a white van which was obstructing his view of a ticket machine at the far end of the car park			0
mr @entity4 , who lives near @entity83 , @entity84 , submitted his photos and a £ 1 cheque to @entity22 on the same day			1
but they refused his appeal so the case ended up at the @entity32			0
in a ruling , the adjudicator said : ‘ mr @entity4 produced photographs of other car parks where there were more numerous and clearer signs			1
‘ i find that relying upon signs at machines at some distance when the entrance is not clearly marked as pay and display but being a @entity6 car park is not sufficient			2
‘ i find that the signage was not adequate and the contravention did not occur			0
’ the council has since changed the signs , with the sign on the wall at ground level moved so it is no longer obscured by the pillar			2
a new sign stating that @entity111 is a pay and display car park is underneath the @entity6 sign at the car park entrance			0
councillor @entity115 , @entity116 member for highways at @entity22 , said : ‘ the signage at @entity111 is continually reviewed as part of the council ’s maintenance programme			0
‘ there is no fee for the @entity32 as they are funded by annual fees from local authorities			0
’ the council refused to state how much they had paid for the case but said the main cost would be officer time .			0

@entity4 claimed he did not know he had to pay at the @entity131 because the sign was obscured
he has now won his battle after sending photographic evidence
mr @entity4 , 56 , said the case had cost him more than the £ 50 fine but he had contested it as ‘ a point of principle '
