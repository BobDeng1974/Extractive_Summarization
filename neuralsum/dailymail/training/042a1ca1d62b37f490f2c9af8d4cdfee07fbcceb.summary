by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 02:47 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 9 may 2013 @entity5 mp @entity4 claims he is being ' bullied ' by the expenses watchdog a @entity5 mp is being sued by the expenses watchdog after refusing to hand over the capital gain on his taxpayer - funded second home			1
@entity4 vowed he will not pay £ 54,000 – the amount the watchdog said represents his constituency home ’s increase in value while he was claiming mortgage interest on his expenses			1
the news comes after it emerged that @entity19 have jointly made more than £ 1 million by selling their second homes			1
the revelation prompted accusations that mps were making a profit using taxpayers ' money			1
mr @entity4 , the mp for @entity28 , is the only one of 29 mps to have refused the demand by the @entity31 to pay up			1
the other mps , including four cabinet ministers , have agreed to repay a total of £ 484,828			1
the money is to cover a proportion of the increased value of their second homes funded by the taxpayer through a mortgage interest subsidy			1
welsh secretary @entity41 was forced to repay the most – £ 81,446 – for a home in @entity43			1
defence secretary @entity44 handed over £ 34,884			2
environment secretary @entity45 paid £ 7,755 and @entity46 , a minister without portfolio , paid £ 737			2
treasury minister @entity47 repaid £ 26,762.76 , universities minister @entity48 £ 7,730.74 , and former farming minister sir @entity49 £ 9,177.12			2
during the expenses scandal , a string of mps were accused of making big financial gains on their second homes			1
there was public fury over the practice of ‘ flipping ’ the designation of second homes to claim more taxpayers ’ cash and over other abuses			2
the expenses watchdog @entity31 has reached deals with 70 mps to repay some of the profit from homes bought with taxpayers ' money @entity31 said yesterday that it had launched legal action at the @entity69 to recover the cash from mr @entity4			1
but the mp said he would not pay up and claimed that his constituency home had fallen in value since he bought it for £ 470,000 at the end of 2005			1
@entity76 , @entity77 - £ 180,000 @entity78 , @entity77 - £ 110,000 @entity79 , @entity80 - £ 170,000 @entity81 , @entity82 - £ 152 , 823 @entity83 , @entity80 - £ 120,000 @entity47 , @entity5 exchequer secretary - £ 67,000 he accused @entity31 of rushing into ‘ heavy - handed and disproportionate ’ litigation which was ‘ clearly intended to bully me into submission ’			1
@entity31 banned the use of @entity90 expenses to pay mortgage interest in may 2010			1
but transitional arrangements allowed mps elected before 2010 to keep claiming the money up to last august – as long as they agreed to return any potential capital gain			1
@entity96 , the former mp who has campaigned for greater transparency , said that @entity19 should repay any profit			2
he told the @entity99 : ' it 's an open and shut case , of course they should pay it back			0
' there is the spirit of the law , why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer ? in this case they very clearly are			0
' mr @entity4 said : ' all @entity114 citizens are entitled to seek legal adjudication if the state ’s actions are unfair or possibly illegal and so i will be forcefully resisting their precipitous litigation			0
' @entity96 , a former mp , said @entity19 should repay any profit they made on their properties he disputes @entity31 's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012 , claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent			1
' at my own expense , i have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and i have made a reasonable offer to @entity31 to settle the matter and reduce the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer			2
' my valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and 2012 , in order to fulfill my duties as both a @entity43 based legislator and a constituency @entity96			2
' ipsa have negotiated with 70 other mps in a secretive and arbitrary manner but in respect of my case , regrettably , they have refused to negotiate			2
' i am merely seeking fair play and consistency and will pursue legal action to receive it			0
' payback : treasury minister @entity47 and former farming sir @entity49 have returned thousands of pounds an @entity31 spokesman said : ' one of the most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where @entity19 got taxpayer support to own a second home			0
that is why we said we would stop this , and we have now done so			0
' the final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short transition period for mps who were already committed to second mortgages			1
' but in doing this we set the condition that the taxpayer would want its share of any increase in the value of the property			0
today we are publishing that these capital gains are worth almost £ 500,000 to the taxpayer			0
' one of the most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where @entity19 got taxpayer support to own a second home			0
that is why we said we would stop this , and we have now done so ' - @entity31 spokesman ' mps knew this was the deal and agreed to the conditions at the start			1
in valuing the property , it was important that we did n't rely on amateur valuations or guesses from the web			0
' instead , we demanded formal valuations at the start and end , from the @entity200 - the most authoritative voice in this field			0
' we would only accept valuations from @entity200 members or fellows - providing proper assurance on the value of the properties			0
' we required all mps to provide these independent valuations at the start and end of the claim period			0
and we published the way in which the capital gain would be calculated			0
the same method of calculation has been applied to all 71 cases			0
' @entity4 provided us with two @entity200 valuations			0
as he has been unwilling to pay the £ 54,000 due we have issued proceedings to recover the sum through the @entity69			0
' among those not asked for repayments were deputy prime minister @entity222 , who claimed £ 9,104 on a home in his @entity225 constituency , and @entity226 , who claimed £ 5,903 on a property in his former seat of @entity229 .			0
