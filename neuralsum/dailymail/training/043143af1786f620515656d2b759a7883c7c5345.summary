an entire village will be resettled in a bid to escape starving jungle tribesmen who keep raiding their homes for food and clothes			1
the @entity7 government has been forced to act after 200 members of the @entity10 tribe staged several raids on a local village in @entity7 stealing food and tools			1
ministers said the attacks are a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on their food supply as loggers decimate their homeland			2
the @entity39 said it has become increasingly hard for the tribesmen to forage for food , leading to thefts and conflict between the two communities			1
in the latest attack , village homes were damaged by the men who also sacrificed domestic animals which they found			1
meanwhile the tribesmen also stole cooking utensils , ropes , machetes , clothes , blankets and even mosquito nets from the villagers			2
the thefts forced the villagers from @entity62 in south - eastern @entity7 's @entity63 to flee to the local police station for safety			0
location : this map shows where the tribesmen live in @entity70 in the @entity63 in @entity7 theft : the attacks are seen as a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on the food supply , as it has become harder to forage , leading them to steal from their neighbours however , the ministry warned that there were likely to be further raids on the isolated region and confirmed they are now planning to move the villagers to a new location to avoid further conflicts			1
the @entity10 are an indigenous tribe of nomadic hunter - gatherers who inhabit the remote regions of the @entity92 rainforest			1
they live in @entity70 in the @entity63 in @entity7			0
they have , in the past , actively avoided contact with non-native people			0
choosing instead to live in voluntary isolation in @entity7 's south - eastern @entity92			0
but last year , they sparked concern by making contact with the outside world for the second time since 2011 , on the river hamlet			0
@entity104 , the minister for @entity39 , said : ' we have in the meantime provided emergency assistance and compensation for the villagers although at this time of year and given the remote location it is difficult to get there			0
' however , it is not the first time an indigenous tribe has been involved in violent conflict with the modern world			2
the most violent raid was in 2010 , when a local was brought to hospital in a critical state after being shot with an arrow in the belly by a tribe member			1
the @entity10 are a hunter - gatherer tribe who live in the @entity92 forest			1
they were one of several tribes designated by the government as ' uncontacted people '			0
the government forbids direct contact with them because the tribes ' immune systems are not thought to be able to cope with the type of germs carried by other @entity7			2
they live a largely isolated life , but sporadically make contact with some of their modern neighbours such as the villagers of @entity62 .			0

at least 200 members of the @entity10 tribe carried out the raid for food
the theft occurred because the tribesmen are finding it hard to find food
in the latest attack , homes were damaged and household items were stolen
