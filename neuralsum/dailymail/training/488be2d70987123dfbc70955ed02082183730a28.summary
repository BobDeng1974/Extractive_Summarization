@entity2 has urged moderate opponents to come together to have a ' united position ' ahead of the planned @entity21 negotiations next month			1
he has warned that while disparate opposition groups remain independent , the strength of extremist groups fighting @entity7 will grow			1
mr @entity2 is meeting today with foreign ministers from 11 @entity27 and @entity28 powers in @entity29 , to discuss how they can support the moderate opposition in the run - up to next month 's peace conference in @entity33			1
the talks are aimed at putting an end to the brutal war which has ravaged the country and its people since 2011 and created hundreds of thousands of refugees			0
the main @entity27 - backed opposition umbrella group , the @entity40 , is scheduled to meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to take part in the @entity42			0
one of the most prominent factions within the coalition , the @entity45 , has said it has no faith in negotiations with the @entity7 regime and will not be part of the @entity21 process			2
however mr @entity2 warned that the longer the conflict went on , the more the position of the extremist groups fighting @entity7 's forces would be strengthened			1
' @entity14 on all sides now need to make the effort and make the compromises necessary for a peace process to work , ' mr @entity2 told the @entity60 4 today programme			1

@entity72 has refused to back @entity7 in any way ' the longer this conflict goes on , the more sectarian it becomes , the more extremists are able to take hold			1
that is why we are making this renewed effort to get a @entity21 peace process going			0
' i am in no way glossing over or minimising the danger of extremism taking hold			0
there are people fighting for extreme groups , not necessarily because of extreme views , but because that gives them access to weapons and training and so on - all the more reason why we have to help the moderate opposition in @entity14			0
' mr @entity2 also raised the prospect that @entity103 - one of @entity7 's few remaining allies in the region - could take part in the @entity21 talks , as long as it was prepared to accept the need for political transition			1
' it is important that @entity103 plays a more constructive role			0
i have discussed the situation in @entity14 with the new @entity103 foreign minister , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' if they are serious , of course it is helpful to have all outside powers involved in this , but that depends on them coming on a common basis of trying to achieve a peaceful settlement on the basis of a transitional government in @entity14			0
fighting continues across the @entity127 country while chemical weapons inspectors mandated by the @entity129 work to destroy @entity7 's arsenal of chemical weapons a suicide bomber detonated a truck packed with one - and - a - half tons of explosives in @entity135 , @entity14 , on sunday			2
at least 30 people , mostly civilians , were killed ' that 's the position of @entity138 and it 's the position of all of us among the @entity141 and among @entity28 nations			0
it should be the position of @entity103 as well			0
' the countries in the ' @entity29 ' , the core group of the @entity146 , are also trying to shift the focus back to the humanitarian crisis after weeks of international attention on @entity7 's chemical weapons stockpile			1
representatives of the @entity40 's leadership are attending , along with ministers from the @entity73 , @entity156 , @entity70 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , the @entity162 and @entity163			0
speaking at the end of today 's meeting , mr @entity2 said : ' the only sustainable way to end this conflict and the suffering of @entity14 civilians is through a political transition			1
during today 's meeting the 11 attending countries have all agreed to continue to provide ' intensive political and practical support ' to the @entity40 , an umbrella group for moderate armed forces seeking the overthrow of president @entity7 , said mr @entity2 , who hosted the meeting at the @entity176			1
mr @entity2 said that , before the talks open in @entity33 , the @entity3 will announce a further package of support for the @entity40 , whose president @entity74 attended today 's gathering			1
@entity3 support will include ' substantial ' non-lethal supplies such as communications , medical and logistical equipment , said the foreign secretary			0
' there can be no peaceful and political solution in @entity14 without the participation of a moderate opposition , ' said mr @entity2			2
' we pledged our further support to them			0
' and he added : ' it is important that we do n't abandon them , we keep faith with them			0
' through the @entity21 process , we will be with them every step of the way , giving them the support they need as well as the practical and administrative support needed to carry out such a negotiation			0
' mr @entity2 said that the @entity146 were not making it a precondition of the @entity21 talks that @entity7 can have no part in the political future of his country , but he made clear that he does not expect there to be a place for him in any transitional administration			1
' the purpose of our meeting today has been to send a signal of our resolve , our unity and our determination in bringing that about			2
' the @entity146 agreed to ' put our united and collective weight behind the @entity223 process which must lead to establishing by mutual consent a transitional governing body with full executive powers ' , as set out following earlier talks in the @entity33 city in june 2012 , said the foreign secretary			2
' by definition , mutual consent means it can only be agreed with the assent of the @entity40 , so @entity7 would play no role in that future government of @entity14 , ' he added			2
mr @entity2 said : ' @entity21 offers the @entity14 people the best hope to improve their lives			2
' we agreed that we will provide the intensive political and practical support that will be required to give the @entity21 process the best chance of success			0
' mr @entity2 said that the @entity7 regime was continuing to use ' disproportionate force ' in response to the uprising , much of it directed at civilians			1
the regime was ' laying siege to desperate people and presiding over a humanitarian catastrophe , with people under siege and people starving ' , he said			0
he warned of a ' deepening humanitarian disaster ' and called on the regime to allow ' full and uninhibited access to people in humanitarian need '			0
he acknowledged that the @entity21 process faced ' immense difficulties ' , but warned that unless moderate forces were supported , the country would be left at the mercy of either @entity7 or extremist jihadists who have latched onto the conflict			2
' the alternative ( to @entity21 ) is a protracted conflict in which neither side will be able to achieve a military victory over the other , ' said mr @entity2 .			0
