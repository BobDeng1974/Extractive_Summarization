by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 10:10 est , 13 april 2013 doctor @entity1 , who was struck off over linking @entity2 with autism , said the government protected the @entity2 vaccine over children 's health the government today dismissed claims by a doctor who sparked a global scare about the @entity2 vaccine that officials were responsible for the outbreak of measles in south @entity15			1
dr @entity1 , who was struck off over the @entity2 controversy , said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the @entity2 programme than they were about protecting children			1
he wrote on a website that in 1998 , following an analysis of studies of the safety of the @entity2 vaccine , which covers measles , mumps and rubella , he recommended the use of single measles vaccine in preference to @entity2			1
‘ this remains my position			0
’ while @entity2 vaccination uptake fell from february 1998 , there was a reciprocal increase in the uptake of the single vaccines , he said			1
‘ vaccination clinics administered many thousands of doses of measles vaccine and children were ' protected '			2
‘ six months later , in september 1998 , the @entity41 withdrew the importation licence for the single vaccines , effectively blocking this option for parents			1
‘ @entity46 cases in the @entity47 rose when the government withdrew the importation licence for the single measles vaccine leaving concerned parents with no choice			1
’ he added : ‘ the government 's concern appeared to be to protect the @entity2 programme over and above the protection of children			1
’ he also said two @entity2 vaccine brands had to be withdrawn for safety reasons			1
these had been approved despite warnings of the dangers			1
‘ these government officials put price before children 's health and have been seeking to cover up this shameful fact ever since			2
’ injection : @entity69 , aged 13 , is given an @entity2 injection following the epidemic patient : @entity73 , aged 11 months , is held in his father 's arms as they queue a @entity78 spokesman said : ‘ dr @entity1 's claims are completely incorrect			1
immunisation advice from the department has always kept the interests of patients paramount			2
' @entity46 is a highly infectious and harmful disease			0
if your child has not had two doses of @entity2 , whatever their age , we urge you to contact your gp surgery and make an appointment			2
’ almost 700 people have become infected in the @entity93 area			0
it was announced on thursday that another 73 cases had been reported - bringing the total number infected there to 693			0
@entity98 ( @entity99 ) has been urging parents of unvaccinated children across @entity98 to act immediately to ensure they are protected against the potentially fatal disease			0
further drop - in vaccination clinics were taking place in @entity15 today to in a bid to immunise the 6,000 children remain unvaccinated in the @entity93 area alone			0
determined : long queues have formed outside several south @entity98 hospitals offering @entity2 jabs to halt the @entity93 measles epidemic injection queue : parents queue with their children in @entity93 for the @entity2 after an outbreak of measles in @entity15			1
after 19 new cases were diagnosed in @entity119 , people in the @entity117 are also being urged to get the injection hospitals in @entity122 , @entity123 of @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity93 , @entity127 and @entity129 areas were among the health centres to open vaccination clinics			0
more than 1,000 @entity2 jabs have been given today at the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			2
dr @entity137 , director of public health at @entity139 , said : ‘ we are very pleased with the number of people who have attended this morning			2
‘ i ca n't stress enough how important it is for you to have your @entity2 vaccination			2
our clinics are open until 4pm today so please come and see us			0
’ last weekend more than 1,000 queued up for the @entity2 vaccination at clinics held across @entity15			2
although the outbreak is centred on @entity93 , cases have continued to be reported across the principality			0
most are in the @entity154 health region , which also includes @entity155 , @entity129 and @entity127			0
vaccination : @entity157 , aged 10 months , is given an @entity2 injection by sister @entity159 the number of confirmed cases of measles ( pictured left ) in the @entity93 epidemic has risen to 693 , @entity98 has confirmed cases have also been found in @entity165 and in the @entity167 area - which covers @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			1
typical symptoms of measles include fever , cough , conjunctivitis and a rash			0
complications are quite common even in healthy people , and about 20 % of reported measles cases experience one or more complications			0
these can include ear infections , vomiting and diarrhoea , pneumonia , meningitis and serious eye disorders			0
before the introduction of the @entity2 jab in 1988 , about half a million children caught measles each year in the @entity47			1
approximately 100 of those died			0
however , concerns over the jab 's safety were raised in the late 1990s when dr @entity1 produced a since discredited paper suggesting @entity2 was linked to an increased risk of autism			1
professor @entity199 , director of immunisation at the @entity78 , said the problems in @entity98 were ‘ historic ’ due to dr @entity1 's discredited claim			1
generally , the vaccination message was getting through to parents , he told @entity205			0
‘ our immunisation coverage rates , currently , are extremely high , 95 % of children are being vaccinated in this country , ’ he said			0
asked about the situation in @entity98 , he said : ‘ that is a historic problem , the legacy of bizarre suggestions about vaccines and autism from 15 years ago , that 's not the situation currently			2
’ he added : ‘ the evidence is that @entity2 among parents of young children is not viewed as unsafe , as it was a decade and 15 years ago			1
‘ the issue we 're dealing with is not parents of young children currently , it 's parents of children from 15 years ago , and they 're the ones that we need to get back and vaccinate			0

dr @entity1 linked @entity2 jab to autism but *research* was discredited
he said single measles vaccines preferred by parents were withdrawn
two *cheaper* *mmr* vaccines were approved despite safety warnings , he said
@entity238 said patients ' health has always come first
