by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 02:38 est , 28 february 2013 for millions of workers , lunchtime is the highlight of their day , which is otherwise marred by monotony , irritation or stress			2
but a study , published yesterday , reveals the crippling cost of buying lunch every day , rather than making your own packed lunch			2
it warns many workers are spending ‘ more cash than they realise on items such as takeaway coffees and gourmet sandwiches			2
’ bringing in your own packed lunch could save you thousands , as research shows people spend around £ 90,000 in a lifetime on average , it estimates the average worker spends nearly £ 90,000 during their working life buying lunch , as well as cups of tea or coffee and occasional afternoon snacks			1
for those workers with an expensive coffee habit , the cost can be huge			2
at @entity38 , a medium - sized cappuccino costs £ 2.45			0
this is the equivalent of a worker , who earns the average full - time salary of £ 26,000 , spending more than three years ’ of their earnings on their lunch			1
workers could pay off a £ 100,000 mortgage about six years early if they put the money towards making over-payments on their loan , rather than buying lunch and other snacks			1
on average , the poll , from the office search firm , @entity53 , found the typical worker spends £ 7.81 a day on their lunch , drinks and other work - time snacks			1
but those who bring in their own packed lunch and snacks as well as making their own tea and coffee spend an average of just £ 1.50 a day			1
one @entity67 - based worker told researchers : ‘ i usually get through about a tenner a day on things like coffees and sandwiches from @entity73			1
eating out at lunchtime might be a treat , but it can rack up bills pretty quickly for those who like to splash their cash ‘ i ’m also fond of fresh fruit and bottles of sparkling water			0
i might also pick up a biscuit a couple of times each week			0
‘ it does all add up but i ’m happy to pay for the convenience			0
i ’m just not the sort of person who would be making my own lunch the night before at home			0
’ the impact over a working life lasting 47 years is eye - watering , particularly when some workers said they spend as much as £ 30 a day			1
the lowest daily spend was £ 3			0
it estimates the total bill will reach £ 88,971 - and will be even higher for those who buy drinks not just for themselves , but their colleagues , during the working day			0
to make matters worse , researchers did not adjust the figure for the rising cost of living , which will inevitably make a worker ’s favourite sandwich , pasty or soup even more expensive			0
@entity113 said its best - selling sandwich is the prawn mayonnaise on oatmeal bread which costs £ 1.90			0
it has been its most popular sandwich since the sandwich was launched in 1982 , although it is occasionally beaten by the £ 2.75 @entity120 sandwich			0
at @entity73 , which has opened 254 branches since its launch in 1986 , the most popular option is the tuna baguette which costs £ 2.99			1
the other two in the top three are the £ 3.65 chicken @entity128 and bacon on artisan bread and the £ 3.25 ‘ posh ’ cheddar and pickle on artisan bread			0
@entity73 said the average customer spends £ 4.55 on their lunch in one of its branches , which comprises of two different items , such as a sandwich and a bag of crisps			1
the study comes at a time when workers are suffering an unprecedented squeeze on their finances , according to the @entity148			0
millions of workers are paid less than they were a decade ago , if their pay is adjusted for the impact of inflation			1
since 2009 , the @entity148 ’s analysis shows the pay rise given to the average worker has been consistently below the rate of inflation			2
for example , the average pay rise given to both public and private sector workers is currently a paltry 1.3 per cent , but the cost of living is rising at 2.7 per cent .			1
