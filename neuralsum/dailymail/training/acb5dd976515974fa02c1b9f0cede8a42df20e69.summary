fancy a trip to an island swarming with 4,000 of the world ’s deadliest snakes that pluck birds out of the sky and kill them with a venom that can melt human flesh ? that ’s what awaits you if you travel to @entity11 20 miles off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14 , which is home to the golden lancehead viper			1
in fact , the island is deemed so dangerous that visiting it was been banned by the @entity14 government - although not before numerous people foolishly ventured there in the past			1
pictured is @entity11 , an island 20 miles ( 32 kilometres ) off the coast of @entity13 in @entity14			1
visitors to the island are prohibited by the @entity14 government owing to the several thousand resident deadly snakes known as golden lancehead vipers , which have venom that is potent enough to melt human flesh @entity11 , understandably nicknamed ‘ @entity11 ’ , is a piece of land 4.6 million square feet ( 430,000 square metres ) in size			1
@entity32 is the only place in the world where @entity35 , also known as the golden lancehead viper , can be found			1
it is listed as @entity38 by the @entity39			0
the species has a light yellowish brown colour on its underside			0
it grows to an average length of 28 inches ( 70 centimetres ) but can reach a maximum of 46 inches ( 118 centimetres )			0
the ‘ lanchehead ’ in its name refers to its pointed head , distinctive of snakes in the genus @entity49			0
lancehead snakes in general are responsible for the most human deaths in @entity55			2
this particular snake has a mortality rate of 7 per cent without treatment , and up to 3 percent still even with treatment			0
its venom can eat flesh and tissue , making prey easier to swallow , while a neurotoxin kills the prey			2
its diet consists mostly of birds , although it has been reported to eat lizards and even cannibalise on other snakes			0
it ’s the only place on @entity72 where @entity35 , also known as the golden lancehead viper , is known to inhabit			1
that ’s probably a good thing , though , as the reptile is regarded as the world 's most venomous viper			1
the island is devoid of almost any human visitors , save for a few scientists granted permission to study the snakes each year , reports the @entity84			2
it is also visited on occasion by the @entity14 navy , who tend to the autonomous lighthouse that was built back in 1909 before scampering clear			2
and it ’s also thought that poachers have been known to visit the island and claim a golden lancehead viper for their own , with their price fetching as high as £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) on the black market			1
the reason the viper has become so deadly is somewhat of a mystery , though			2
after all , they are not too dissimilar to their brethren on the mainland			0
the predominant theory is that 11,000 years ago sea levels rose and separated the island from @entity14 , which left the snakes on the island with limited sources of food save for migrating birds			2
the golden lancehead viper ( @entity35 ) , pictured , is only found on this one island			1
here @entity114 researcher @entity113 holds one snake while watching another			0
the snakes have been known to kill humans in the past , including a hapless fisherman who stumbled across the island @entity11 , understandably nicknamed ' @entity11 ' , is a piece of land 4.6 million square feet ( 430,000 square metres ) in size found 20 miles ( 32 kilometres ) off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14 the problem was , though , that most venoms take a while to act - sometimes as much as a few days			1
by the time the snake ’s venom killed the birds they would have moved elsewhere , so instead the snakes evolved an incredibly strong venom that can kill prey almost instantly			1
it is five times more potent than other snakes and can even melt human flesh			1
in humans , the bite from a golden lancehead viper carried a seven per cent chance of death			1
and before the island was deemed off - limits there were several stories of people succumbing to the deadly predators			2
one story tells of a fisherman who lost power in the engines of his boat			0
after drifting to the island he ventured inland , unaware of the terrors that lay in wait			0
when his boat was eventually discovered , he was found dead in a pool of blood covered in snake bites			0
another story is of the last lighthouse keeper to inhabit the island with his family			0
rumour has it they ran in terror when snakes crawled in through their windows ; their bodies were later found scattered across the island			0
the island is believed to have become separated from the @entity14 mainland 11,000 years ago when sea levels rose , which forced the native snakes to evolve their potent venom in order to catch airborne prey			1
the island is devoid of almost any human visitors , save for a few scientists , poachers and the navy on occasion the name of the island itself tells of its troubled history			2
@entity11 roughly translates as ‘ the island of the slash - and - burn fire ’ , so - called because of a failed attempt to develop a banana plantation on it			1
however , in the last 15 years the population of snakes on the island as reduced by as much as 15 per cent , due to a combination of vegetation removal and disease			0
and on the @entity39 ’s @entity201 the snakes are currently listed as critically endangered			0
with thousands of snakes remaining , however , it ’s probably still not the ideal holiday destination .			0

an island off the coast of @entity13 is home to the golden lancehead viper
it is the only place the so - called ' world 's deadliest snake ' is known to live
their venom is potent enough to kill people and melt human flesh
*access* to @entity11 is banned by the @entity14 government
in the past humans have been killed by its deadly inhabitants
