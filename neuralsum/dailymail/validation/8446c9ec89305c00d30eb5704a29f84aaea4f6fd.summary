a slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature 's incredible tongue acrobatics			1
captured at 1,500 frames per second , the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill			1
to do this , the panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds			1
captured at 1,500 frames per second , this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket the video , captured by @entity24 , reveals how the tongue reaches around @entity26 - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet			1
the creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles , along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring			2
when a muscle called the long accelerator contracts , the retractor muscles relaxes			0
this causes other muscles to press against collagen springs , giving it incredible power and speed			0
location : northern parts of @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
size : male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length , with a typical length of around 17 in ( 45 cm )			2
females are smaller , at about half the size			0
@entity56 : two to five years reproduction : panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months			2
females usually live only two to three years after giving birth			0
the tongue ’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle , and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup			0
with eyes that operate independently like gun turrets , the remarkable reptile also has a full 360 - degree arc of vision around itself			0
in january , new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion			1
the @entity79 chameleon species @entity80 releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved			1
previous studies did n’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons , the @entity85 study said			0
when comparing body - size relationship with tongue performance , smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics			2
the panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds the tongue ’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle , and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup dragging it in			1

the video , by @entity24 , features a panther chameleon
it shows the creature shooting its *flexible* tongue out in 0.07 seconds
@entity109 reaches @entity26 - four times faster than acceleration of a fighter jet
