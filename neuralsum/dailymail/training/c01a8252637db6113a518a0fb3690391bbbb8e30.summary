@entity1 ‘ infantilised ’ welfare claimants by letting them choose a life on benefits , @entity0 declared today			1
the last government ’s handling of the system had divided @entity10 and created ‘ resentment ’ among taxpayers , the @entity6 added			1
in his first election campaign speech on the benefits system , the @entity6 said it was a ‘ national disgrace ’ under @entity1 which had ‘ infuriated ’ those forced to pay for welfare			1
@entity1 's handling of the welfare system divided @entity10 and created ‘ resentment ’ among taxpayers , the @entity6 said as he appealed to voters for five more years ‘ to finish the job ’ mr @entity0 outlined his ‘ @entity10 deal on welfare ’ which he said would ‘ restore real fairness to our country ’			1
he confirmed proposals to force jobless youngsters to do community work rather than just going straight on the dole			1
instead of signing on , young people will be forced to pick up litter , clean graffiti or work for local charities			2
this would give them the ‘ order and discipline of turning up for work each day ’ , he said			2
there are around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole			0
mr @entity0 defended the coalition ’s reforms – including the benefits cap , tax cuts for low earners and rises in the minimum wage - and challenged the idea it was ‘ compassionate ’ to ‘ leave people on the dole for years with no incentive to get into work ’			1
addressing activists and the media at a school in @entity58 , @entity59 , he questioned the ‘ myth ’ that it was ‘ kind to sentence people to never going anywhere ’ or to let ‘ people in their teens and twenties sit at home all day slipping into depression and despair ’			0
under @entity1 welfare became ‘ a series of giveaways ’			2
young people could ‘ leave school , sign on , start getting your benefit , start getting housing benefit ’ while making only a ‘ minimal ’ contribution , he said			0
@entity0 appealed for five more years ‘ to finish the job ’ to stop @entity79 becoming prime minister he said : ‘ no cv ? no problem			1
no real effort put in ? no problem			0
‘ and all this had a corrosive effect			0
for those paying for welfare – it infuriated them			1
for those dependent on welfare – it infantilised them			2
’ ‘ because people do n’t just live up to expectations – they live down to them too			0
‘ if you give people nothing to work for , no responsibilities to uphold – they ’re going to lose the ability to stretch themselves and find work			2
mr @entity0 added : ‘ our welfare system should be something that unites our country in pride – not that divides it in resentment			1
’ the prime minister said @entity1 treated benefit claimants like children ‘ but when people worked hard and paid their taxes , knowing that others were choosing to live on welfare			2
‘ when they saw their money going on social housing they could never afford to live in			0
‘ or when hardworking young people were stuck living with their parents into their 30s – while others got a council house straight out of school , that created a sense of deep unfairness			0
‘ we are putting that right with a clear set of rules that apply to all ; a @entity10 deal on welfare			1
’ mr @entity0 promised people in work would be better off , support for those who are ‘ genuinely sick or disabled ’ and ‘ dignity and security in retirement ’ for those who worked hard all their life			1
but to anyone who refused to work he said : ‘ we will not keep supporting you			0
’ the @entity6 pointed to the rise in employment , and the 700,000 job vacancies for those looking for work			1
the government ’s economic plan was working and being felt ‘ in people ’s pockets and homes and hearts and hopes ’ , he said			0
the @entity154 attacked the plans saying they placements were designed to ‘ punish ’ young people			0
‘ these placements are not designed to help someone into work , more to punish			0
just like the @entity163 plans to axe housing benefit for young people , it 's all stick and no carrot , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ young people should be given help and support into the work place , help at job centres , and the opportunity to get on in life , not just written off as feckless and lazy			1
’ @entity1 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary @entity174 ministers should introduce ‘ @entity1 's compulsory jobs guarantee to get young people off benefits and into paid work			2
’ ' under @entity0 young people can spend years claiming benefit without being offered and required to take up paid work			1
@entity1 's compulsory jobs guarantee would ensure young people are given the chance to learn , earn and contribute			0
