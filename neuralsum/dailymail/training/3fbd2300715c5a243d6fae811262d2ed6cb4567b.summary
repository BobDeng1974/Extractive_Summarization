by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:26 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 14:28 est , 11 april 2012 @entity2 faced a walkout by @entity4 today as he was addressing parliament in the latest sign of growing dissent against the strongman			1
it came the prime minister and president - elect , who mockingly refused to intervene in a hunger strike by a politician over an allegedly rigged mayoral election in the southern city of @entity16			1
dozens of mps from the @entity20 opposition party left the chamber complaining of @entity2 's ‘ rudeness ’			1
glowering : @entity23 prime minister and president - elect @entity2 scowls after mps walk out of the @entity25 the scowling strongman : despite the once unthinkable defiance by opposition mps , mr @entity2 continued to deliver an aggressive speech in which he also described @entity30 as a ' @entity32 relic ' the faction 's mayoral candidate @entity33 has been on hunger strike for 27 days and there are concerns over his health			1
two dozen supporters are also refusing to eat			0
they alleged @entity2 's party @entity40 ' stole ' the election by fiddling the ballots , an accusation that is denied			2
the walk - out - unthinkable until recently - came when president - elect @entity2 told @entity4 : ‘ your colleague @entity33 started the hunger strike but did not appeal to court			1
this is a bit strange			0
why go on hunger strike ? ’ but @entity33 claims the authorities barred him obtaining key evidence to back his case in court			1
his supporters also claim the city is run by a ‘ mafia system ’ and the courts are biased			0
@entity2 also today called on @entity23 to have more children to halt a declining population			2
‘ for @entity23 every person counts today , ’ @entity2 said			2
empty seats : just @entity23 party leader , @entity63 , sits alone after the majority of his colleagues walked out focal point : @entity16 mayoral candidate @entity33 , who has been on a hunger strike for 27 days ‘ a strong , happy family with several kids is what the state , society , religious , educational and cultural organisations should unite their efforts around			1
‘ we should realise that we will come face to face with a serious challenge - the demographic echo of the 1990s when @entity23 experienced its severest drop in birth rates			0
' we need new decisive steps when it comes to saving and caring for people			0
’ and he called on @entity23 to cut down on cigarettes , vodka and illegal drug use			0
‘ smoking , alcohol and drug abuse - without any wars or calamities - claim 500,000 lives of our countrymen every year , ’ he warned			0
‘ this is simply a horrific figure			0
’ chamber : @entity2 begins his speech to the @entity25 in which he also complained about @entity23 's falling birth rate during his address , @entity2 also called @entity30 a relic of the @entity32 but said he supported letting the alliance use a @entity23 airport as a supply hub in support of its mission in @entity103			1
@entity104 is studying a request from the western alliance for use of facilities at an airport in the @entity111 city of @entity112 as a transit point for shipments of non-lethal supplies to and from @entity103 by air , rail and road			0
@entity23 has allowed @entity103 - bound @entity30 transport through its territory since 2009 as an alternative to convoys through @entity123 , which have been subject to militant attacks , but no permanent facility was involved			2
‘ i consider @entity30 ... a throwback to the @entity32 era			1
it was created at a time when there was a bipolar system of international relations , ’ said @entity2 , who has frequently criticised the alliance and its eastward expansion			0
but , in his last address to parliament as prime minister before his return to the @entity138 next month , @entity2 dismissed fears that @entity30 's use of the @entity112 facility could represent a threat in @entity23 's heartland			1
crackdown : @entity145 officers detain a protester during a demonstration outside the @entity25 growing unrest : @entity23 opposition members with white ribbons form a human chain outside the parliament ‘ there will be no @entity30 base there , ’ he said , but only ‘ a hop over pad ’ for military cargo transit			2
‘ therefore i assure you that nothing unusual , not corresponding to our national interests , is happening there			0
on the contrary , everything that is being done in this sphere fully corresponds to the national interests of our people , ’ he told parliament 's lower house			0
in remarks that suggested @entity23 does not intend to decrease cooperation in @entity103 , @entity2 said ‘ in some cases @entity30 is playing the role of a stabiliser in global affairs ’ and included the @entity103 mission among such cases			1
the @entity179 fought a disastrous war in @entity103 and @entity23 ruled out sending troops to aid the @entity183 - led invasion after the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , but @entity2 - president at the time - offered the use of @entity23 airspace and other support .			2

once - unthinkable walkout came after mps complained of his ' rudeness '
@entity2 refused to intervene over @entity33 's hunger strike of 27 days
he also called @entity30 a ' @entity32 relic ' in sabre - rattling speech to parliament
