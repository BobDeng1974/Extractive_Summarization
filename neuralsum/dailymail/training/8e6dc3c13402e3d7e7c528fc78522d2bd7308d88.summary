@entity0 was excellent against @entity1 last week and had a fine game against @entity3 at the weekend too			1
he set up two goals including one for @entity5 with one of my two favourite passes of the season			0
it was just as good as @entity11 ’s assist for @entity12 against @entity13			0
@entity0 was magnificent for @entity14 against @entity1 and @entity3 @entity16 playmaker @entity15 levelled the scoreline shortly before the interval @entity0 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity14 team - mates @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 on saturday @entity0 and @entity15 's stats now @entity0 needs to start producing these kind of performances week in , week out			1
he is still only 22 and has all the talent and skill to become a top player but he is not yet consistent enough			1
@entity15 is 29 and was the best player on the pitch at @entity31 , even scoring after reacting first to @entity33 's shot which was possibly heading wide , but he plays like that most weeks for @entity16			1
@entity0 should take a leaf out of his book			2
in his time in @entity37 , @entity0 has been unable to match @entity15 , as our table shows			1
but his last two games show he is more than capable			0
he just has to show he can keep it up			0
@entity33 celebrates with his team - mate following @entity15 's equaliser in the 45th minute @entity0 ( right ) jumps into the air and waits to receive the ball at @entity31 last week @entity15 ( left ) , holding off the challenge of @entity1 's @entity47 , is brilliant week in , week out for @entity16 city not out of it it was not the game we all hoped for at @entity31 on saturday , far from it			1
i predicted a 1 - 1 draw but had hoped for a thriller			2
before the game i ’m sure most @entity1 fans would have taken a draw to keep their five - point lead at the top			1
as soon as @entity16 scored you could sense @entity63 and his team were happy with that			2
in the second half they sat deep and soaked up @entity16 ’s pressure but came away with a result that suits them just fine			2
@entity1 striker @entity72 put his side in the lead with a 41st minute opener against @entity16 @entity33 's strike at goal was eventually turned in by @entity16 team - mate @entity15 @entity72 is congratulated by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring his fifth goal of the season the fixture list looks kind for them for the rest of the season			1
of the top sides , they only have to visit @entity87 , whereas @entity16 have to go to @entity14 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
but @entity1 do play @entity14 and @entity88 at home and they will not be easy games			1
@entity16 have @entity93 and @entity94 to come back from the @entity95 and @entity96 ’s men came from behind to win the league last season			2
this title race is not run yet			1
@entity1 boss @entity63 ( second left ) will have been relatively happy with the result at @entity31 @entity72 places the ball past @entity16 goalkeeper @entity102 to put his side in the lead @entity1 goalkeeper @entity105 is called into action during the top - of - the - table clash in west @entity108 five into two does n't go if the battle for the title is a two - horse race , then the fight for @entity112 spots could be tougher than ever			1
@entity87 , @entity88 , @entity14 and @entity89 all won , which makes @entity117 the biggest losers of the weekend			2
one thing is for sure - it ’s going to be a real scrap for those two spots			2
it was good to see @entity122 scoring again after injury and @entity87 proved they can win without @entity124			0
@entity125 ( second left ) celebrates his goal during @entity88 's victory over @entity128 @entity129 ( second left ) celebrates during @entity87 's 5 - 0 thumping of @entity131 on sunday @entity117 's @entity132 ( second left ) gets frustrated during his side 's 1 - 0 home loss to @entity135 the transfer window is always mad but a fit @entity21 will feel like the signing of the season for @entity14			1
@entity141 and @entity142 lead the way for @entity89 , @entity88 keep grinding out results and , despite a surprise defeat , @entity117 are still in the mix. let battle commence			2
@entity21 unleashes a shot on his return from injury at @entity151 for @entity14 as they beat @entity3 @entity21 celebrates scoring after making his return from injury and turns to his trademark dance celebration @entity89 striker @entity141 celebrates scoring during his side 's victory at @entity158 @entity159 1 - @entity160 has as many @entity162 hat - tricks as @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
they all have one each			0
scoring a hat - trick at any level is an achievement but @entity160 can be proud of his perfect treble - a goal with either foot and a header			1
queen @entity174 will be kicking themselves for the way they conceded the goals , but @entity160 took them well			2
with @entity182 out for the season , @entity181 need somebody to step up and score			2
@entity160 has made a good start			2
@entity160 collects the ball with a smile having bagged three goals against @entity190 @entity160 ( second left ) scores his third of the match with his head to complete a perfect hat - trick the @entity195 international ( left ) celebrates a superb hat - trick during the 3 - 1 win over relegation threatened @entity190 @entity200 was a no - brainer for @entity202 signing a player in the january transfer window is always a bit of a risk			1
you never know if they are going to hit the ground running or disrupt your plans			0
when @entity212 brought in @entity213 it was as close as you can get to a risk - free deal			1
if there ’s one thing @entity213 guarantees , it ’s goals - he ’s not even fully fit and he already has his first for @entity221			1
there were a lot of clubs looking at him because everyone knows he is a master finisher			0
the deal he ’s on works out as big money but if his goals help keep @entity221 in the @entity162 , there ’s no question it will be money well spent			1
@entity213 celebrates scoring for @entity221 against @entity13 on saturday afternoon @entity213 tries a shot at goal but is closed down by @entity13 's @entity236 ( right ) at the @entity237 he ( left ) turns away to celebrate scoring @entity221 's second goal and his first since joining the club @entity240 's the new free - kick master the free - kick @entity142 hit against @entity243 was unbelievable			1
then he followed it up with another beauty against @entity158			0
the @entity246 is fast becoming one of the @entity162 ’s top free - kick specialists			1
i love the way he takes them			0
he is so relaxed and in control of his body and he can bend the ball into either corner			0
he hits it in quite an old - fashioned way - more @entity258 than @entity165 - and decides where to swerve the ball rather than hitting it and expecting it to move around itself			0
free - kicks can be a game of cat and mouse with goalkeepers , but he is keeping the keepers guessing			1
he ’s got a way to go to match the @entity162 ’s best , as our table shows , but he ’s certainly on the right road			2
@entity142 scored a wonderful curling free - kick against @entity158 on saturday @entity142 ( left ) positions himself ready to curl the ball up and over the on - looking @entity158 wall the @entity158 wall ( right ) jumps but can not get high enough to block @entity142 's wonderful effort 2 - things are not looking pretty for @entity280 and @entity281 at present			1
their 3 - 0 drubbing at home by @entity285 means they have won just two of their last 13 league games at the @entity290 , a run that stretches back to last season			0
they have also failed to score in 11 of their last 15 @entity162 games and have kept only one clean sheet in their last eight league matches			2
12 - @entity13 have leaked goals all season			0
of the 38 they have let in , 12 have been headers - that ’s more than any other team in the league			0
@entity305 should give @entity306 a regular starting spot			0
in nine league starts the @entity309 ( has been involved in seven goals , scoring four and setting up three			0
167 - @entity21 made a scoring return from injury for @entity14 and bagged his first goal since the opening day of the season - 167 days ago			1
his last goal came against @entity117 at @entity151 on august 17			0
5 - @entity316 will have been delighted @entity317 hung on to win at @entity318			0
it stopped a run of five consecutive away defeats			0
4 - @entity322 clearly enjoys playing against @entity131			0
all four of the goals he has been involved in this season have come against @entity327 ’s side - he has two goals and two assists			0
9 - @entity285 like a sub who can make an impact			0
@entity334 ’s goal against @entity281 made it nine times this season that a @entity285 player has come off the bench and scored			0
that ’s three more than any other side .			0

@entity0 was excellent for @entity14 vs @entity1 and @entity3
but @entity15 was best player on pitch for @entity16 vs @entity1
@entity0 is in form but he must *replicate* @entity15 's consistency on the field
@entity16 are not yet out of the title race and @entity1 must *beware*
@entity160 should be proud of his perfect hat - trick for @entity181
@entity213 's signing for @entity221 was a no - brainer for @entity212
@entity142 is becoming one of @entity162 's top free - kick takers
