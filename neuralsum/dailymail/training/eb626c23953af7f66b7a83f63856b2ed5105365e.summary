by @entity0 a gold ring made by the wealthy money lender who founded the @entity4 has been found in a field by a treasure hunter			1
the 24 - carat piece of jewellery was a ' mourning ring ' made in memory of @entity11 , who owned the land where @entity13 would later be built			1
it was found near @entity15 in @entity16 by @entity17 using his metal detector , and was yesterday declared treasure trove by a coroner			1
treasure : this mourning ring was made in memory of @entity11 , a famous money lender discovery : the ring was found by enthusiast @entity17 using his metal detector in @entity15 , @entity16 @entity11 was one of the most famous - and notorious - money lenders of the 17th century , and was worth the equivalent of £ 30million when he died			1
he owned land across @entity30 , which was then on the edge of @entity32 , including the plot where @entity13 would later be built			1
@entity34 in @entity30 , now home to upmarket art galleries and exclusive restaurants , is named after its former landlord			2
among the businesses on the street which cater to the ultra-rich are rifle makers @entity44 and the @entity47 - starred @entity46 restaurant @entity43			0
property : @entity11 owned the land where @entity13 now stands , then just outside @entity32 home : the remains of @entity52 , one of the many properties owned by @entity11 legacy : @entity34 in @entity30 is named after the landowner and money lender @entity11 also became sheriff of @entity16 , and owned land across the county including @entity52 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
after he died in 1662 , he passed his fortune to a great - nephew , and it was eventually inherited by the @entity65 from which the @entity65 is descended			1
the @entity4 still owns swathes of central @entity32 , centred on the ultra-wealthy areas of @entity30 and @entity69			1
@entity11 also left a number of mourning rings to his family , like the one found by mr @entity17			1
contrast : this engraving shows @entity75 in 1616 , around the time that @entity11 was trading in land rural : this engraving shows how the area beyond @entity80 , including @entity81 's and @entity30 , was considered part of the countryside during the 17th century mourning rings were usually commissioned by people coming to the end of their lives and bequeathed to their descendants in order to ensure that their memory was perpetuated down the generations			1
the rings were made of precious metals and jewels , and often contained a lock of the deceased person 's hair			0
' according to mr @entity11 's will , he had 11 rings made in two different sizes - one to fit men and the other for women , ' mr @entity17 said			1
' i have n't heard that any of the others are in existence			0
' burial place : @entity11 was laid to rest in the @entity109 after he died in 1662 @entity11 ( 1577 - 1662 ) apparently started his career with just £ 100 , and was worth £ 400,000 - the equivalent of around £ 30million - by the time he died			2
he was known as a philosopher and a lawyer - but it was as a money lender that he made his vast fortune and won widespread notoriety			2
@entity11 used his riches to invest in land , with his most prominent estate being the manor of @entity122 in what is now @entity30			2
he bought the land from @entity125 , @entity126 , who was desperate for money to pay his debts , and after his death passed it on to his great - nephew			0
the estate was then inherited by @entity132 , who married an ancestor of the current @entity65 , now one of @entity32 's biggest landowners			2
@entity11 was buried in the @entity109 , befitting his status as a lawyer - but his death brought forward a stream of invective from those he had taken advantage of			0
a pamphlet on his life entitled ' the way to be @entity143 ' claimed that he had lived ' a life of intricacies and misteries , wherein he walked as in a maze ' , while a later author wrote : ' his whole life was one of trickery and disreputable craft			0
' in the @entity156 era , @entity11 was remembered as ' a most heartless blood - sucker ' and was posthumously condemned by @entity158			0
the enthusiast added : ' i am so excited about it			0
' i have found some lovely 13th - century thimbles but not something you can associate with a specific person like this			0
' if i keep metal detecting for the next 20 years , i do n't think i will ever find anything as good as this			0
' the ring is currently being held at the @entity170 , and its fate has yet to be determined after the coroner ruled that it should pass into the hands of the @entity175			0
the @entity4 , which includes much of central @entity32 , is one of the largest and wealthiest landowners in @entity178			1
it is now owned by the 6th @entity65 , a member of the @entity65 , but it has its origins in the property owned by @entity11			1
the @entity65 inherited the @entity183 estate , covering most of what is now @entity30 , @entity69 and @entity185 , via @entity11 's great - niece @entity132			1
wealthy : the @entity65 , left , has been enriched by the legacy left to his family by @entity11 ; his daughter @entity189 is pictured right with her husband @entity190 prime property : mount street in @entity30 , at the heart of the @entity4 property empire they started developing the area in the 18th century , starting with @entity196 before stretching down into the areas around @entity198 and @entity199			1
@entity69 developed into a popular neighbourhood thanks to the purchase of @entity13 by @entity202 in 1761 , with the area 's stylish regency architecture capturing the neo-classical spirit of the age			0
the areas owned by the @entity4 was one of the first extensions of @entity32 beyond the traditional boundaries of the @entity211 and @entity80 , transforming regions once thought of as suburban or even rural into fashionable central @entity32 neighbourhoods			1
much of the estate is named after properties owned by the @entity65 - for example , @entity198 is named after their country seat of @entity219 in @entity220 , while @entity221 is named for their relative the @entity222			2
while parts of the estate have been sold off over the centuries , the @entity4 still owns much of central @entity32 as well as properties in other cities around @entity178 and elsewhere			1
the group holds large portfolios in cities including @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 the company is run by professional property executives , but its only shareholders are a group of trustees who manage the holding on behalf of the @entity65			2
origins : this image shows @entity196 shortly after the initial development of @entity30 home : @entity219 in @entity220 is the main country house of the @entity65 thanks to the family 's extensive holdings , the current @entity65 is worth £ 7.8billion , putting him at number eight on the @entity252 - and everyone above him was born abroad			2
he grew up on an island in the middle of @entity258 's @entity257 before being educated at @entity259 , where he obtained two o - levels			0
the @entity65 then went to @entity262 and became an officer in the @entity264 , later working the the @entity265 as assistant @entity266			0
the @entity268 are one of the few @entity178 families to be wealthier than the @entity271 , but there are close links between the @entity65 and the @entity274			0
one of the @entity65 's personal properties is a hunting estate in @entity277 , southern @entity278 where @entity280 @entity279 and @entity281 went for a shooting holiday earlier this year			0
his son @entity65 is godfather to @entity284 and his daughter @entity285 is married to @entity286 , a family friend of the @entity287			0
another daughter , lady @entity288 , is married to television presenter @entity190 , whose father is political pundit @entity290 .			0

@entity293 ' mourning ring ' was made in memory of @entity11 , who owned vast estates in @entity30
his property eventually became the @entity4 under the @entity65 , who still owns much of central @entity32
ring was found by @entity17 in @entity16 using an ordinary metal detector
@entity11 gave the ring to his descendants when he died in 1662
