there is n't a single mention of anyone singing @entity3 , and it certainly was n't jam they were making on the kitchen worktop			1
so a raunchy tale of two sex - starved sweethearts has aroused the passions of the @entity10 – after it was published by members			2
the @entity13 - style short story appears in a charity book put together by a @entity16 writing group			1
yesterday they defended their decision to include the @entity20 work in a compilation of poetry and fiction , although one member conceded : ' it 's not for the faint hearted			1
' but some of the good folk of @entity29 – the otherwise perfectly respectable @entity31 town where the book is on sale – disagree			1
' really , one does not expect such smut from a group of women involved in the @entity16 , ' said @entity37			1
she added : ' i was wholly shocked			2
the last tale in the compilation is a steamy three - page piece of erotic fiction ( pictured , left to right from back : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 who form part of the @entity16 writing club ) the door creaked and in @entity62 walked			1
he looked amazing to behold with his mound of auburn curls and his newly grown designer stubble			2
he gave her a cheeky wink and a teasing tap to her rump			2
@entity72 turned and gave him a massive full bodied hug			2
she kissed him temptingly and gave him her most longing and yet innocent of looks			2
' i can tell you missed me @entity72			2
been quite a while ... and i am a man in desperate , aching need ... ' @entity62 knew she was teasing him			2
he put his arms around her waist from behind and gently gyrated his massive schlong against her lovely wide buttocks ' come on ... drop your drawers , @entity91 ! this man is lusty ! ' @entity62 was masterful in his demand			2
the tempo of their passion escalated			2
he could n't wait for his ' oats ' any longer			2
his girl was certainly a naughty one ! ' do you think it 's worked this time ? ' @entity72 quizzed pleadingly			0
he had in his lust forgotten all about their efforts to conceive			0
' who knows , @entity91 ? you never know ! now be a good woman and make us a cuppa			0
that exertion has totally knackered me out ! ' @entity62 then gave her buttocks a loving , playful tap and went and turned the tv on			0
they would forever remember this moment in time			0
it would later prove to be a life - changing segment in their story			1
@entity120 showed that this @entity121 with his goddess had finally conquered the game that is conception @entity124 , 50 , who sells the book from her shop , nurtured by @entity127 , in the town , said a local @entity16 woman came in and told her : ' i do n't know if you want to sell this because the last chapter is a bit raunchy '			1
she added : ' i 've been reading the book – i read the last chapter first ! i can see why some of the older ladies are kicking up a fuss			1
but it 's just a bit of fun			0
' the story , @entity142 features a couple called @entity72 and @entity62 , reunited when he returns from a long spell at sea with tumbling auburn curls and newly - grown designer stubble			1
the pair are married , it transpires , and – praise the lord – intent on starting a family			0
at least that fits in with a @entity16 ethos that has held firm since the organisation 's inception in 1915			1
yet @entity62 has barely crossed the threshold before it 's straight down to business			0
to be fair , the story is just three pages long so there 's precious little space to waste on plot development			1
but what follows might make even @entity168 @entity167			0
much of it is unsuitable for repetition			0
suffice to say that heaving thighs and ' magnificent cleavage ' feature among the less controversial prose			0
things hot up as soon as @entity62 announces : ' i am a man in desperate , aching need			0
' the story continues : ' she was trying to play hard to get			1
that was becoming difficult as she really wanted it right now on top of the kitchen counter			0
' it continues : ' @entity72 giggled in that mischievous way he loved , whilst playfully taunting him with those eyes			0
' she feigned interest and bent over the worktop to reach the tin of tea bags			0
@entity62 put his hands around her waist from behind … ' heavens to @entity196 ! in a @entity16 book ? surely not ? the short story , written by a @entity16 member for a charity book they have released , is called the @entity142 but yes , yes … yes ! @entity62 – ' masterful in his demand ' – skips the romance by commanding : ' drop your drawers , @entity91 – this man is lusty ! ' their lovemaking causes ' sudden waves of pleasure ' to pulse through @entity72 's entire body			1
but then it 's back to normal			0
' make us a cuppa , ' says @entity62 , and moves away to turn on the tv			0
the story comes with an 18 - plus rating for readers and warns : ' read no further if you are of a delicate disposition or think you may be offended by the contents of what follows			1
' some are clearly not , however			0
the book , with an innocuous cover featuring butterflies and flowers in the artwork , was disappearing from local shops yesterday and 150 have already been sold			1
the compilation authors are members of the @entity232 , which takes its name from the town 's monument			1
members of the @entity16 writing club from @entity29 , @entity31 the 75 - page book called @entity239 is being sold for £ 4 their @entity241 page at www.facebook.com/monumentalwomensink contains details of the work below a photograph of some of the @entity29 team			1
the £ 4 book , @entity249 : @entity239 , is being sold to raise money for nearby @entity253 's @entity252 centre for cancer treatment			1
group leader @entity50 , a 63 - year - old retired writer , said : ' when 50 shades came out , we talked about it quite a bit			1
we decided that we would have a go and try to write some ourselves			0
' in the end , only one of our members managed to produce a piece			0
' when the book was compiled , the story was included			1
unlike @entity267 , however , the author remains anonymous			0
' she does n't want anyone to know it was her , ' mrs @entity50 explained			0
' she said her gran would be furious			0
