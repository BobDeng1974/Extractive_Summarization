by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 04:21 est , 17 january 2014 long since a favourite with the royal family , luxury department store @entity2 has announced the highest profits in its entire 306 - year history			1
often referred to as the ' @entity9 ’s grocer ' , the store managed to buck 2013 's bleak high street trend for pretty dismal festive sales figures			1
the company announced the incredible profits this week , which showed that sales reached £ 65m in 2013 , up 10 per cent on the previous year , and profit before tax was £ 1.8m , a five-fold increase on 2012			1
@entity2 has announced the highest profits in its entire 306 - year history , despite other high street stores struggling together with the @entity19 and the @entity20 , the @entity9 visited @entity21 's , which has many royal warrants , last year and despite people still feeling the effect of recent economic hardship , the @entity24 public are clearly not afraid to fork out for luxury , with sales of truffles up a whopping 130 per cent , and hand - carved wild salmon up 18 per cent			1
for the five weeks up to 5 january 2014 , sales were up 16 per cent , which may in part be due to recent re-vamping of the @entity36 store in 2013 , including the launch of a jewellery room and a new room dedicated solely to candles			2
as well as the high - quality produce with which @entity42 's is synonymous , part of their festive success is down to their famous hampers , which sold in record numbers this @entity49			2
the world - famous hampers were up by 15 per cent , providing the group with the best hamper sales in its 306 - year history			2
another cause of the success may be the fact that @entity2 opened a new store and tea salon located inside @entity61 in november last year @entity42 's had a brilliant @entity49 period , and in the five weeks up to 5 january sales were up 16 per cent truffles up 133 % @entity64 up 42 % @entity65 up 26 % hand carved wild salmon up 18 % candles up 41 % @entity69 , chief executive of @entity2 , said : ' @entity49 at @entity2 's was one of the best yet , both in terms of sales and customer satisfaction			1
' the demand for more bespoke luxurious items , together with the @entity49 staples , is at an all - time high , suggesting that consumers still want to treat themselves during the festive period			2
‘ we continue to invest in the business to provide our customers with the best possible experience , both in our stores and online - another area of significant year on year growth			0
' established in 1707 , the @entity9 's grocer @entity2 has been a @entity36 stalwart for 307 years			1
the iconic @entity88 building in @entity89 , the heart of @entity91 , is a favourite tourist destination as well as the place well - to - do @entity94 shop for luxury hampers and foie gras , or take high tea			1
@entity2 has supplied goods to royalty since 1707 when co-founder @entity2 was appointed footman in the household of @entity103			0
its close association with royalty - and the number of warrants it has received - mean it is one of the most prestigious and exclusive department stores in the world			0
a hallmark of luxury and extravagance , hamper sales were up by 15 per cent over the @entity49 period as more and more people give them as gifts to impress			0
here @entity120 lifts the lid on what is inside one of these iconic baskets			0
the @entity125 hamper by @entity2 @entity126 : £ 1,000 , fortnumandmason.com delivery cost : £ 6.95 what you get : the palatial proportions of this new and outstanding hamper contain a feast that is fit for the finest of palates			0
beginning with @entity134 of @entity135 and a magnum of vintage champagne , the excitements continue with foie gras , caviar and black truffle oil , as well as some superb @entity24 delicacies such as @entity142 and @entity144 ’s @entity143			0
the menu concludes with our magnificent florentines , @entity149 truffles and @entity151 ’s @entity150			0
accompanied by a fine parade of wines and spirits hand - picked from the @entity2 cellars , this is a supremely luxurious hamper			1

luxury items such as truffles and hand - carved salmon saw leap in sales
