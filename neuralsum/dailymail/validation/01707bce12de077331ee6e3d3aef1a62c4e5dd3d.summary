@entity1 ’s elevation from ceo to @entity4 chairman at thursday 's club summit will also see the world ’s richest league have a new - look set of directors			1
but the board will remain remarkably different from the company director structure at the top of other multi-billion - pound businesses			0
the three - strong @entity4 version is expected to consist of just @entity1 and two newly appointed independent directors to be unveiled on thursday , who will hopefully provide some gender and race diversity			1
@entity1 ( left ) will be elevated from ceo to @entity4 chairman at thursday 's club summit and be joined by two newly appointed independent directors @entity21 chairman @entity20 will be under pressure to explain his campaign for more homegrown players the formation , which will need a change of @entity4 statutes , is at least a step nearer fit - for - purpose governance than the current two - man board of @entity1 and @entity31 , the interim chairman who is standing down			1
the @entity4 still regard their six - times - a - year club summits as board meetings with their 20 shareholders , despite most of the top - flight foreign owners never bothering to attend			2
meanwhile , @entity21 chairman @entity20 has tended to keep quiet in @entity4 meetings , but he will be under pressure on thursday to explain his campaign for more homegrown players in @entity4 squads to help the national team			1
@entity20 has strong backing from @entity43 for this initiative , which has n’t been supported by the @entity4 representatives on the @entity21 board			2
it will not please @entity49 fans but the strong word is that their manager @entity51 is heading for @entity52 at the end of the season , irrespective of whether @entity55 are promoted			1
it would seem odd for @entity51 , who will not comment about his future , to swap the solid @entity49 set - up for the madness of @entity60 , but football rarely fails to surprise			1
@entity49 manager @entity51 is looking a strong possibility to head to @entity52 at the end of the season @entity64 were seemingly expecting their entire global membership to buy tickets for @entity69 ’s return this season , judging by emails received on wednesday from @entity72 confirming the purchase of seats			1
the botched memos went to the full @entity64 database , much to the county ’s embarrassment , with a phone message on the @entity81 ticket office voicemail telling callers to disregard the mass posting			0
@entity72 are infamous for their computer system continually crashing during the sale of @entity87 seats			0
@entity69 's signing back at @entity64 coincided with a bothed mass email to members about tickets @entity92 , who stands down as @entity94 chairman in may , has been the loudest autocratic voice on most @entity97 cricket issues since he took the helm in 2008			0
yet @entity92 has chosen to stay noticeably silent on @entity69 ’s return to @entity64			0
the @entity100 are taking a lot longer than promised to probe the @entity102 returns of @entity104 and @entity105			0
the @entity104 issue centres on a @entity108 marketing deal to offset losses , agreed with a @entity111 agency owned by former @entity4 chairman sir @entity112 and his son			2
and investigating @entity105 owner @entity114 writing off £ 60million of debts to counter massive breaching of @entity102 limits is proving hard enough without the extra difficulties of ceo @entity119 having left the club and finance director @entity121 moving to @entity122			0
threat to @entity125 project there are concerns at the top of @entity130 football that @entity125 ’s @entity132 plans are in danger of running out of time			1
@entity125 has spent more than a year being frustrated by complex state and city @entity136 politics stopping him finding a suitable stadium site			2
@entity130 football heads are fearing @entity125 ’s @entity132 plans could out of time and @entity130 chiefs do not believe the proposed venue close to the @entity144 baseball arena is the right location			1
powerbrokers say @entity125 should build a waterfront downtown ground to maximise the appeal of the new franchise			2
@entity150 remain 100 per cent confident that the project will work and are concentrating on funding that will determine the club ’s ambitions			0
@entity155 , the @entity156 , who has shown no interest in sport during his year in the job , bizarrely chose the last week before the election recess to make his first speech on the subject			0
@entity155 ’s views on sport investment away from national governing bodies have credence , but why did he bother when he wo n’t be coming back to the @entity167 ?			0

@entity4 ceo @entity1 to be made chairman
his elevation on thursday will come at the latest league summit
it coincides with the appointment of two independent directors
@entity49 boss @entity51 is strongly *tipped* for @entity52 move
fears that @entity125 ’s @entity132 plans in @entity136 are running out of time
