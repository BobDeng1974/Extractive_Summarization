pensions minister @entity0 has hinted the government is going to extend the scheme to current pensioners ministers are expected to unveil plans in the @entity6 next month which would allow millions of pensioners to cash in their annuities			1
pensions minister @entity0 has given his strongest indication yet that the government will launch a consultation into the radical proposal imminently			1
the changes will give five million retirees the same freedoms as those who have not yet taken their pension			1
under reforms to be introduced in april , workers will no longer have to buy an annuity – an annual income for life – when they retire , and can instead cash in all or part of their savings			2
but until now this freedom has not applied to existing pensioners who have already bought an annuity			2
at a conference for the @entity29 yesterday , mr @entity0 hinted the government was going ahead with plans to extend the scheme to current pensioners			1
the changes will help people who are locked into low - paying annuities , who would rather cash it in and spend the lump sum			1
insurers would buy the annuity from the pensioner and , in return , the firm would be entitled to that person ’s monthly income until they died			2
experts predict the government will announce a consultation in the budget to woo the ‘ grey vote ’ in the run - up to the @entity51			0
around five million pensioners hold six million annuities , worth about £ 11billion a year , according to @entity47 figures			1
mr @entity0 said early talks with pensions providers had been positive , saying : ‘ i have not heard any compelling argument against the proposition [ to allow annuities to be sold ]			1
’ he told the @entity61 there was ‘ growing interest in how this will work ’ and that he was working on the details			0
the proposition , he said , was simple			0
‘ i have a stream of income			0
i would rather have capital			0
someone then buys it from me – i envisage a financial institution rather than an individual , ’ he said			0
he denied that many people could be ripped off by insurers and pension firms , who may pay offer paltry sums for a valuable lifetime income , explaining : ‘ lots of these annuities were taken out , say , five years ago , when interest rates were way higher , so that stream of income would cost a fortune to buy now – that will make the deal more attractive			1
’ he added that retirees would need to be aware that transaction fees and consultation fees could soon erode a very small annuity			0
pensions expert @entity89 , of @entity90 , said it was ‘ very likely ’ that the government would announce a consultation about the sale of annuities , an idea which ‘ sounds attractive in principle ’			2
but he warned : ‘ there is , however , a significant risk of consumer detriment and mis - selling and the costs of any system like this may well outweigh any possible benefits			0
