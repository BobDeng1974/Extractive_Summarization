by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 21:08 est , 13 december 2013 a police force has been accused of trivialising rape after it distributed a bizarre @entity5 poem about the crime			1
the verses – a version of ’ @entity9 adapted to tell the story of a woman being sexually attacked – were composed by @entity12 as part of an awareness campaign			1
but members of the public branded the poem , renamed @entity18 , ‘ disgusting ’ and ‘ insensitive ’			2
critics have said @entity12 's version of @entity9 trivialises the horror of sex attacks it features on a poster distributed at train stations across the county			1
at first glance , the design appears to be aimed at children , with a cartoon drawing of a snow - covered cottage with smoke coming out of the chimney			0
but women ’s groups have called for it to be removed immediately , saying it is too explicit for children and that it belittles the horror of sex attacks			1
@entity39 , of the @entity41 branch of women ’s aid , said last night : ‘ it ’s a disgrace and should be withdrawn immediately			0
‘ i have spoken to some of our clients who have been victims of sexual assault and they have been utterly distressed and shocked by this poem			2
‘ they feel that the re-working of a poem aimed at children trivialises the worst event in their lives … children familiar with the proper @entity5 poem would be left very confused if they came across this police version			1
’ she added that the force should concentrate on a ‘ stark , unambiguous message that rape is wrong ’			2
one verse that has drawn particular criticism from campaigners reads : ‘ although she screamed “ no ” it happened in a flash / as soon as she could free herself she made a desperate dash			0
’ earlier this week @entity12 had to re-name an anti-crime poster campaign called @entity72 after critics deemed it to be in poor taste a spokesman for the group @entity76 said the phrase ‘ happened in a flash ’ was not an accurate portrayal of a victim ’s experience			1
she added : ‘ that experience can feel like it goes on forever and even after the attack it will stay with that person for a very long time almost like a recording in their mind that goes over and over again			0
’ but @entity12 denied the poem was offensive and said the poster aimed to make would - be rapists more aware of the catastrophic harm sex attacks have on women			1
despite admitting it had ‘ caused a stir ’ and holding a meeting yesterday to discuss the complaints , the force decided not to remove the poem from its website			1
@entity12 yesterday insisted they had consulted two unnamed women ’s groups before the poster was distributed			1
superintendent @entity105 apologised to anyone who had been offended by the ‘ re-working ’ of the poem – traditionally read to children on @entity110			1
but she added : ‘ issuing safety messages for people who are out enjoying @entity5 festivities is a valuable way of helping to protect , in the main , women and girls from sexual attacks			0
‘ however , sometimes , constantly reiterating these messages can make women feel that they are at fault if they are attacked … we want women to know that if they are raped or sexually assaulted , they are not to blame			0
‘ our message to men is that it ’s not acceptable to take advantage of a woman because she has had a drink or is being sociable			0
and women should n’t have to tolerate or be forced to guard themselves from predatory behaviour			0
’ but @entity128 , of campaign group @entity129 , said last night that the police force had ‘ failed spectacularly ’			2
‘ many women tell us that they did n’t want to report to the police for a variety of reasons , predominantly the fear of being blamed for their own sexual assault , ’ she said			0
‘ police campaigns such as this add to the commonly - held view that women can somehow prevent rape			0
’ earlier this week @entity12 was forced to rename an anti-crime poster it had called a ‘ @entity72 calendar ’ after critics complained it was in poor taste .			2

support group says force 's version of poem trivialises horror of sex attacks
@entity12 has been urged to take poem from its website
the force has apologised if poem has caused offence but kept it on site
