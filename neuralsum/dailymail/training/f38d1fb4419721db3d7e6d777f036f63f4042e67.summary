by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 22 may 2013 @entity1 of @entity2 is an ' unambitious ' and ' bland ' individual who should be called @entity4 's ' @entity3 ' , according to a leading feminist author			0
in a blistering attack republican @entity6 , who has turned down an mbe , says that @entity9 should be compared to @entity10 and @entity11 and claims she has ' done little ' apart from marrying prince @entity12 and falling pregnant			1
it comes months after best - selling author @entity15 's venomous and upsetting critique of the @entity1 , in which she called the 31 - year - old royal a ' mannequin ' with ' dead eyes '			2
attack : in her book @entity22 , @entity6 devotes an entire chapter to the @entity1 where she calls her an ‘ unambitious , uncontroversial and bland ' person who married @entity12 and ' got pregnant ' the @entity28 writer also branded her a ' machine - made ’ princess , ‘ designed by committee ’ , who went from a ‘ jointed doll on which certain rags are hung ’ to a woman whose ‘ only point and purpose ’ was to give birth			1
now ms @entity6 has devoted a chapter to @entity9 in her new book @entity22 , which she has called @entity3 @entity3			1
‘ by the age of 30 , the new duchess of @entity2 had done little since leaving university except play a supporting role to her boyfriend , marry him with great pomp and ceremony and get pregnant , ’ she writes			1
‘ she had never really enjoyed an independent identity or income — even her clothes were paid for by her father - in - law — and did n’t seem to aspire to either			0
‘ @entity50 , uncontroversial and bland , @entity9 was @entity3 in everything but name			2
’ referring to those who have been branded @entity54 , @entity6 cites @entity11 and @entity10 , then adds of @entity9 : ‘ it ’s all the more telling that the prime candidate , the woman who arguably deserved the title more than anyone , never appeared on lists of the country ’s leading contenders			2
’ comparison : the feminist author , who turned down an mbe , says @entity9 is like @entity11 and @entity10 she claims the @entity1 has become famous ‘ not for her achievements but her willingness to play the most traditional feminine role of all : waiting for a husband , getting married and not long afterwards becoming pregnant ’			1
ms @entity6 is best known for writing the @entity70 crime novels , and her new book is about what she sees as the backlash against gender equality and its ‘ staggering viciousness ’			1
the @entity76 - educated 59 - year - old was married to satirist @entity78 for eight years and then had a relationship with disgraced mp @entity80 , who was suspended from the @entity81 for using fake receipts in his parliamentary expenses and forced to resign his seat			0
@entity85 : in her vicious attack on the @entity89 , award winning author @entity15 called her a ' doll to hang rags on ' criticisms : @entity9 , who married prince @entity12 in 2011 , pictured at a wedding earlier this month , is famous for playing a traditional role , not her own achievements , says ms @entity6 the storm of criticism @entity9 has faced even forced prime minister @entity98 , 46 , to step in to defend her			1
' what i 've seen of princess @entity9 at public events , at the @entity99 and elsewhere , is this is someone who 's bright , who 's engaging , who 's a fantastic ambassador for @entity4 , ' he said			0
' we should be proud of that , rather than make these rather misguided remarks			0
' but a month after @entity15 's comments , broadcaster @entity109 also gave her strong opinion about the @entity1			0
' we used to admire women who got their place in life through marriage and having children , ' she said , ' but i like to think we 've grown up a bit			0
i ca n't think of a single opinion she holds - it 's very @entity122 ' .			0

@entity124 @entity6 has dedicated a chapter to @entity9 in her new book
duchess has ' done little since leaving university except play a supporting role to her boyfriend , marry him and get pregnant , ’ she writes
ms @entity6 is one of several *prominent* women to attack royal publicly
