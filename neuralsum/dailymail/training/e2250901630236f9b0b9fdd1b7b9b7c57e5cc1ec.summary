the @entity0 revealed on tuesday a report showing that 2013 saw the smallest gender wage gap in history			1
while the gap was the smallest in disparity data that dates back to 1960 , women still make significantly less than men			1
in 2013 , women earned 78.3 cents on a man 's dollar			1
that was up slightly from 2012 , when women made 76.5 percent of what men did			1
still serious problem : the @entity0 revealed on tuesday data showing that 2013 saw the smallest gender wage gap in history -- but it 's still a significant disparity @entity16 has the nation 's largest gender pay gap , with women paid about two thirds of what men are paid , according to new census data			1
figures from 2013 also show that @entity26 's gap was 77 percent , about average nationally , but average pay for both men and women in @entity26 was the nation 's lowest : $ 39,956 and $ 30,667 respectively			1
' there 's still a $ 10,000 or thereabouts difference , ' said former state sen. @entity33 , a member of the @entity35			2
in @entity16 , by contrast , men 's pay was in the top half nationally , averaging $ 48,318 , while women 's pay ranked 44th among the states and @entity42 at $ 31,865			1
that indicates high gender segregation in @entity16 jobs , ' possibly in the oil and gas area , which pays well but does n't have a lot of women , ' said @entity49 , vice president of governmental relations for the @entity50 , which used census data for men 's and women 's average pay to calculate the pay gap for all 51 jurisdictions			1
the @entity42 had both the narrowest gender gap — women 's pay averaged 91 percent of men 's — and the highest average pay at $ 67,610 for men and $ 61,760 for women			1
it was followed by @entity63 at 86 percent , @entity64 at 85 percent , and @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 at 84 percent			2
the widest gaps , after @entity16 's , were 69 percent for @entity69 and @entity70 and 70 percent for @entity71 and @entity72			0
most of the top states and @entity42 , have highly educated workforces , @entity49 said			0
' the average educational attainment for women in this area is much higher than the national average			2
we do know that getting an education can help women close the pay gap			1
it does n't completely close it but it is one of the best tools women have to help boost themselves , ' she said			2
the bottom five , like @entity16 , tend to rely heavily on ' kind of traditional male jobs , ' she said			0
' in @entity70 you have coal mining ; in @entity69 you have ranching and farming			0
in @entity72 , there 's a booming energy and gas industry			0
' some of the gap may just reflect the way income is reported , @entity49 said			2
' we know , and ranchers talk about it , that when you 're running a ranch it 's a family operation			0
but when you report the income you report it for the head of household			0
' @entity33 said seven equal - pay bills were introduced in the @entity109 last year			1
they never even got before the chairman of the committee			0
' @entity26 's @entity115 senators , both @entity114 , both voted against a national bill			1
@entity33 said women nationwide should all stage a one - day strike			2
' do n't go to work			0
do n't go to the office			0
do n't go to schools			0
do n't go if you work for the state of @entity26			0
