by @entity0 and @entity1 when most 13 - month - olds are picky , it 's all about taste			1
for @entity5 , it 's a matter of life and death			2
@entity8 has a rare digestive disorder that makes her white blood cells attack her body every time she swallows food			1
her desperate parents have been able to find one foot that does n't cause her to break out in horrible fits of vomiting and diarrhea - squash			1
struggle : parents @entity23 and @entity25 are desperate to find new foods that their daughter @entity5 her can tolerate - so far it 's only squash @entity5 had to be fed medical food through a tube that ran from her nose to her stomach for most of her life			1
but she can now eat squash mother @entity23 and father @entity25 tell the @entity37 that they were lucky to find that one thing their daughter could eat			1
for the first several months of her life , @entity5 lived in nonstop misery as her body attacked itself every time she swallowed any food			1
' she did n't sleep , and she started refusing to eat , ' ms @entity23 told the newspaper			2
at one point , she had n't eaten anything for 15 hours straight			2
even a single morsel could set her body against her			0
on recent afternoon , @entity5 found a doughnut crumb at her grandmother 's house and put it in her mouth			0
vomiting and screaming for hours followed almost immediately			1
@entity54 doctors told mr @entity55 and mr her that @entity5 simply had a colic or bad acid reflux			0
happy baby : keeping @entity8 healthy and happy is difficult			1
but it 's easier now that her parents have found one food she can tolerate the medical food that still makes up most of @entity5 's nutrition is n't covered by her insurance and costs up to $ 900 a month but , after months of enduring their daughter 's screams , the family took @entity5 to @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , where doctors found white patches in her throat and a biopsy showed high levels of white blood cells			1
' the white blood cells are wired wrong , and when children with this condition eat food , the white blood cells come in to fight off the food because they think the food is a foreign invader , ' ms @entity23 explained to the @entity37			1
doctors said @entity5 had eosinophilic esophagitis , a digestive disorder			1
they told the parents to take her off all food and put her on @entity90 , an amino acid - based medical food			2
for months , the @entity90 had to be fed directly into @entity5 's stomach through a tube in her nose			1
now , she can drink the food through a bottle			2
but it does n't taste very good			0
' it tastes like cardboard			0
it 's the most disgusting stuff i 've ever tasted , ' ms @entity23 said			0
@entity5 used to cry all day - every single day because of the pain that eating caused her			0
she even started refusing all food her parents have slowly but surely been trying out simple foods to see whether @entity5 can tolerate them			2
it 's no mystery when something does n't agree with her			0
she screams and cries and throws up			0
so far , the only thing that her parents have found is squash			1
however , they are currently testing her with white potatoes , apples and bananas - all in very small quantities			0
ms @entity23 's insurance covers the doctors visits , but it does not cover the medical food - which @entity5 still needs to survive			2
it costs ms @entity23 and mr her up to $ 900 a month			0
meanwhile , the girl 's parents hide their own eating from their daughter because she wants to have what they 're eating			0
' we have to hide it from her , which is not very fair , ' ms @entity23 said			0
' with all the appointments , it 's a struggle to keep her feeling good every day and to keep up with all our everyday business			0

@entity8 her is 13 months old and has eosinophilic esophagitis
the rare condition causes her to get horrible diarrhea and vomiting every time she eats *normal* food
the only thing she can currently stomach is squash
