@entity0 indulged in a spot of misty - eyed grandstanding in @entity3 yesterday morning			0
‘ this was a vote for @entity6 because we know we are better together , ’ he opined			0
‘ to all the people who voted @entity10 , this @entity8 is determined to show that we can be the vehicle for your hopes , your dreams , your aspirations , for a better life for you , a better life for @entity17 , a better life for the whole of the @entity20			1
’ it was windy stuff , packed with the sort of vacuous platitudes we ’ve come to expect from a @entity8 leader who in recent weeks has looked more out of his depth than the @entity28			1
‘ let us be able to tell our children , to tell our grandchildren , that we did not just keep our country together , we changed our country together			0
the irony is that @entity8 , and by extension , its leader , should have been able to take for granted a huge bedrock of support in @entity17 , where it has 41 mps			1
with @entity63 ’s ‘ toff @entity61 ’ being so toxic in @entity17 ( which has never forgiven @entity59 for the poll tax ) , it was always clear that @entity8 voters would decide the outcome of the referendum			1
but @entity0 had long neglected @entity17 voters – and the @entity8 machine north of the border had become too complacent			1
three years ago , when @entity0 was asked by the @entity69 to name the three contenders for the leadership of the @entity8 , he could n’t			1
in recent months , he has been a relative stranger to @entity17 , visiting only seven times since april			1
the first occasion was to preside over a shadow cabinet meeting in @entity3 , which was rightly dismissed by the nationalists as a pathetic pr stunt			0
significantly , four of the seven visits came in the past two weeks , after panic gripped the @entity8 hierarchy when a poll put the @entity10 campaign in the lead for the first time			1
far from providing a robust , inspiring leadership for the no campaign , @entity8 has on the whole been negative , unfocused , riven with personality splits , littered with political mistakes , and undermined by a sharp drop in membership which means the party could not mobilise enough troops			1
mutiny : labour leader @entity0 faced a backlash from his own mps over his take on @entity97 devolution as the campaign progressed , it became clear that @entity0 had little to offer disillusioned @entity8 voters north of the border , other than a risible pledge that by voting ‘ no ’ they had nothing to worry about because he would be prime minister after the next general election			1
tellingly , a poll published in the past week revealed that @entity63 leads @entity0 by 17 points among @entity17 voters : a devastating indictment for a @entity8 leader			1
one of @entity0 ’s silliest ideas was the call for @entity97 towns to fly the @entity112 to ‘ show we achieve fairness , equality and social justice better together than we do apart ’			0
the idea was ridiculed north of the border			0
@entity0 also failed to persuade @entity119 , the general secretary of @entity120 , @entity20 ’s largest trade union , to deploy his vast army of members on the streets of @entity17			2
desperate gamble : @entity0 joined the other party leaders to make an 11th - hour pledge to @entity17 but it was the @entity0 ’s decision to sign an 11th - hour joint statement with @entity63 and @entity129 , promising @entity130 more power after a no vote , which was not just a desperate gamble but a major strategic error			1
it was perceived in @entity17 as a gift for @entity137			2
the @entity139 leader used the declaration to portray the @entity8 as being in bed with the ‘ hated @entity61 ’			1
wherever @entity0 and his entourage went after the declaration , they were drowned out by well - organised @entity10 campaigners armed with megaphones and chanting ‘ traitors ’ and ‘ @entity61 ’			0
one of the reasons the campaign lacked passion was @entity0 ’s decision to gift the leadership of the @entity153 campaign to @entity36 , a likeable man of total integrity – and zero charisma			0
a better choice would have been @entity158 , who held a string of @entity161 posts , but stood down when @entity162 became prime minister			0
he was untainted by the economic collapse , and as a tough street fighter would have been more adept at countering @entity137 ’s unscrupulous wheeling and dealing			0
even after @entity169 ’s woeful performance in the second tv debate with @entity137 , the @entity8 leader resisted pressure to call up @entity162 , who has a huge following in @entity17 , where he has been an mp since 1983			1
but there was a problem : having worked closely alongside @entity162 for a decade , @entity0 knows better than anyone how much the former pm and @entity169 despise each other			0
@entity162 was also barely on speaking terms with @entity179 , the shadow foreign secretary , and @entity8 ’s international aid spokesman , @entity181 – two other key figures in the @entity153 team			2
thus , for months the bitter personality disputes that tore the last @entity8 government apart kept the biggest beast in the @entity8 jungle off the campaign trail			2
only when @entity169 was visibly shrinking under the weight of responsibility was @entity162 unleashed , to spectacular effect			0
surge : on the eve of the poll , @entity162 delivered one of his finest speeches , which was steeped in history , and rippling with passion and fervour , all of which were noticeably absent from @entity169 ’s workmanlike offerings on the eve of the poll , @entity162 delivered one of his finest speeches , which was steeped in history , and rippling with passion and fervour , all of which were noticeably absent from @entity169 ’s workmanlike offerings			2
so why did n’t miliband appeal to @entity162 sooner ? one senior @entity8 source told us : ‘ @entity162 has been at his brilliant best , galvanising our supporters and sending bolts of energy through the campaign			2
he has been making the headlines for all the right reasons			0
@entity0 has been made to look very small by comparison in the past seven days			0
it ’s why a lot of @entity0 ’s people did n’t want @entity162 to the fore			0
’ equally , @entity0 ’s decision to rush into a joint statement with @entity63 and @entity129 – which had not been cleared by his own party – infuriated @entity8 frontbenchers such as @entity225			1
they woke up yesterday to hear @entity63 pledging , in return for the increased powers he promised to @entity17 , that for the first time @entity97 legislation will be the responsibility only of @entity97 mps			1
a @entity8 source said : ‘ @entity0 has castrated our 40 - odd @entity17 mps			1
it could be disastrous and put us out of power for a generation			0
serious up - and - coming @entity17 politicians wo n’t want to go near @entity239			2
@entity162 might have had his faults , but if this rule is enforced it means mps like @entity162 would never have set foot in @entity239			0
no wonder the likes of @entity225 are cross			0
’ labour mps are left asking themselves : if @entity0 could n’t mobilise mass support in a country where the @entity61 are a spent force , what chance has he got of winning over doubters in the @entity252 ’ southern heartlands ?			2

labour leader has long neglected @entity17 voters before the historic poll
he was asked by @entity69 to name @entity8 contenders and could *n't*
one poll even *suggested* he is trailing @entity63 among @entity17 by 17 points
