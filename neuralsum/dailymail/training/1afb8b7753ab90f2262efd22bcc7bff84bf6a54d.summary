the owner of a used car showroom in @entity2 has been ordered to remove decorative bunting from his premesis - because it could be too much of a distraction for passing motorists			1
@entity8 , who owns @entity9 , was asked to take down his decorative flags which hang outside his business near @entity12 following a council planning meeting on wednesday			1
the bunting was one of the concerns raised when mr @entity8 presented an application to expand his car dealership			1
@entity8 , pictured , has been ordered to take the bunting away from his used car lot by council officials @entity23 gurus fear the bunting , circled , may distract motorists driving along outside his showroom the council raised the bunting issue as a matter of concern when he applied to expand the size of his business councillors were divided in opinion over the plan , with those opposing the expansion citing the appearance of the site as one of their biggest concerns			1
councillor @entity43 , planning chairman of @entity44 said there was a ' kaleidoscope ' of colours of cars on the site and said there were worries of the visual impact the business had on its surroundings			1
mr @entity8 said : ' it 's absolutely ridiculous			1
i 'm doing nothing other than trying to make a living here			2
' this follows an earlier decision by @entity62 workers who erected a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath			0
the sign in @entity66 was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards , which enclose a pedestrian - only zone in the residential area			0
@entity73 used car dealer @entity74 , right , faced his own problems with the authorities in the tv show @entity74 @entity82 , 89 , who has lived in the area all her life , said : ‘ it ’s bizarre , you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car			2
‘ the sign is actually on the pavement , it ’s not like it ’s a few yards before , there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards			0
‘ i know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far			0
’ in @entity102 , @entity101 has ordered its refuse collectors not to drag bins along residential driveways			0
councillor @entity106 branded the move ' crazy ' saying it was ' health and safety gone mad '			1
he said : ' when you apply to be a refuse collector it is pretty obvious you will be expected to collect refuse			0
it is kind of part of the job description			0
' wheelie bins have wheels and are easy to move around and refuse collectors are trained to do it			0
it is like telling a footballer not to play football in case he breaks his leg			2
' if [ health and safety bosses ] says it is dangerous for all these big strapping lads to move the bins , what about all the little old ladies who are going to have to do it instead ? '			2

@entity8 *wanted* to *increase* the size of his @entity2 used car show room
planners *warned* that his bunting could distract passing motorists
once councillor described the situation as ' a kaleidoscope of colour '
mr @entity8 's situation is the *latest* case of ' health and safety gone mad '
