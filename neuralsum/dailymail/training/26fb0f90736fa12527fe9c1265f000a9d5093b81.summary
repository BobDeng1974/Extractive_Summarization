it started out as an idea by a group of young radicals and evolved into a national icon over the years becoming the beating heart of youths across the country			1
as the triple j contemplates middle age , sounds like @entity10 , airing on the @entity11 , looks back on how one small alternative radio station became the finger on the pulse for @entity16 's youth culture			1
bursting onto the air as @entity18 in 1975 and controversially rebranding as it went national as triple j in the 1990 's , it has played a vital role in unearthing new talent and staging major music events while changing the face of @entity16 music forever			1
' i was surprised as anyone when i was halfway through my phd in mathematics in @entity63 uni that i found myself doing the midnight radio shifts on triple j , ' he said			1
' it was obviously not part of a bigger career plan			0
' @entity32 described working the odd hours as hilarious fun			0
' you can do really weird and out there talk - back , ' he said			0
' there was a beautiful eclectic bizarre mix of people at 3 in the morning listening to triple j - i used to absolutely love it and it was a great way to learn the radio skills			2
' moving to the more civilised breakfast shift in 1999 , @entity32 formed a formidable duo with fellow comedian @entity33 for six years			0
' we just do n't talk over the top of each other - you can tell from body language , ' he explained ' a lot of it is non-verbal communication is going on that the listeners do n't know about			0
' you are just looking at each other and one of you will give a sign of " do n't worry i 've got this covered " or one will be look at the other as if to say " over to you - i 've got nothing "			0
' while @entity33 joked that his time at the station was reminiscent of the 60 's - ' if you remember your time there - then you were n't really there			2
' @entity100 ( right ) and @entity101 are former hosts on triple j : ' the kiddies liked adults being silly and we were very silly ' @entity107 performing at the @entity108 in @entity109 , 2009 , made it big with triple j 's ongoing support @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 ( right ) modelling @entity116 merchandise with the original logo @entity32 thinks the recipe to the station 's success was that the listeners outgrow the alternative youthful sound			1
' it 's that listeners generally get old and move on and think it 's just ridiculous music they ca n't listen to anymore and think the station has turned uncool - which is great because it means it 's just constantly appealing to new listeners , ' he said			1
he said the international acts who appeared on the station were blown away by the unique concept			0
' they could not get the head around the concept - it was so original they would say " we 've just promoted our show around the whole country in one 10 minute slot , that 's awesome " , ' he said			2
' bands in the @entity139 kind of understand it but it is so much cooler than @entity141 - the idea that it 's independent music and most of it local and national bands			1
' a lot of artists and bands from overseas also greatly benefited from airplay in @entity16 on triple j. ' there was a period of time where the @entity154 sold more albums in @entity16 than the @entity156 because - there were just perfect for triple j , ' he said ' one of the reasons a lot of the big bands come to @entity16 and tour is because they are working off the networks they have built through triple j. ' @entity166 performing at the @entity167 in @entity63 in 2004 @entity168 ( right ) and @entity169 ( left ) hosted a saturday night show before moving to sunday afternoons and eventually the weekday breakfast shift but of course there are endless local acts that are forever indebted to the station 's unique style			1
' bands like the @entity107 play to stadiums now filled with 20,000 people - it would n't have happened without triple j , ' @entity32 said			0
singer @entity36 won triple j 's , unearthed , a competition for unsigned artists , in 2001 which kick - started her career			1
' they gave birth to me in a way which is a really weird thing to say , ' @entity36 laughed			0
acts were invited to send in cassette tapes with the aim to get the invaluable air time for their original material as part of @entity196			2
' as many as 800 cassettes would arrive the afternoon of the cut off - date - you would literally get an armful of @entity201 's take them home and listen to them , ' @entity32 said			0
' now 15 years on , that 's an independent digital network - the unearthed community is unbelievable			2
' bands who are heard on unearthed get picked as support acts for other bands			0
' @entity212 lead singer @entity211 performing at a @entity116 outdoor concert in the 1970s @entity214 ( left ) , host of triple j current affair show , @entity216 , with @entity221 leader and mining magnate @entity218 ( right ) @entity28 ( centre ) with @entity169 ( right ) hanging out in the triple j studios in 1995 @entity224 hosted various different shows on triple j between 2000 and 2007 @entity32 said people forget that the station is a true pioneer in supporting up and coming artists			2
' i think people take it for granted because it has been around for a while - if you look at the cultural footprint of it - it 's quite amazing what it does , ' he said ' you 've only got to stop and listen to what other radio stations play for a few minutes to realise how important it is that we 've got a station like triple j to play the music that it does			1
' he says another appeal is that the station does n't sit alongside the top - rating @entity254 commercial stations			0
' it 's consistently rated at five per cent in those markets - that 's a million people @entity16 wide but you would n't want triple j rating 12 per cent , ' he said			1
' you would lose something if the station started playing the sort of stuff that would get that many people			0
' however , as irony would have it triple j 's @entity267 , that hit the airwaves every @entity269 weekend , is the biggest music poll in the world			2
@entity32 has no doubt that triple j will be alive and well in another 40 years			1
' it will out last us all			0
