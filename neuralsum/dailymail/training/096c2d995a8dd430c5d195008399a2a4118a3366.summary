by @entity0 its pencil skirts and cashmere cardigans are firm favourites with the likes of @entity6 and @entity7			1
so @entity9 shoppers should have been delighted when @entity10 opened its first @entity12 flagship store in @entity13 yesterday			1
instead , they were astonished – because the prices are up to three times higher than in the @entity16 , for exactly the same items			1
but some are being sold at a far greater mark - up , including a silk shirtdress which is on the @entity16 website at a special price of $ 99.99 ( £ 63 ) before tax , but in the @entity13 shop for more than three times as much at £ 198			1
the @entity16 prices do not include tax , which varies by state , but it is usually between 5 and 10 per cent of the sale price			1
some prices in the @entity56 at its launch yesterday were even higher than on @entity10 ’s @entity9 website			2
a dress from the shop ’s collection range was £ 450 in store but £ 375 online – or $ 375 ( £ 234 ) from the @entity16 site			1
yesterday shoppers who queued to be first into the @entity13 store were angry to discover they had paid over the odds			2
@entity16 schoolteacher @entity68 , 48 , had visited hoping there would be @entity9 - exclusive lines but was horrified by the prices			1
@entity9 shoppers were upset to find that they were being charged more than their @entity16 counterparts some of the items in the @entity13 store are more expensive than the same thing on the retailer 's @entity9 website ‘ it ’s shocking that it ’s cheaper in the @entity81 , ’ she said			1
‘ i ’m going to return the shoes i bought and get some when i get back if it ’s less expensive			0
’ one shopper wrote on @entity85 : ‘ @entity10 kids is adorable but same price in £ as it is in $ is a no go for me ! ’ while another said : ‘ @entity10 looking nice on @entity26			0
@entity90 hike from the @entity81 a bit cheeky though			0
’ but the company defended the prices , saying they reflected the ‘ materials and craftsmanship involved ’ and the levels of taxes , duties and operational charges			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it is an inescapable fact that these costs in the @entity9 are significantly higher than in the @entity16			2
there are not many products that do n’t vary in price from country to country			0
it is simply a fact of life			0
’ @entity6 , pictured in @entity111 , is one of @entity10 's biggest fans - but a blazer will cost £ 350 the company has defended the prices , saying they reflected the ' materials and craftsmanship involved ' and the levels of taxes , duties and operational charges stylish celebrities @entity118 and @entity120 ( l ) and @entity121 and @entity122 ( r ) at the launch @entity10 creative director @entity124 poses on the runway at the @entity127 show ' party dressing should never be head - to - toe shine and sparkle			1
if you 're wearing a jewelled top , then maybe wear it with a menswear trouser and a loafer			0
things that play off each other , instead of matching up , create a fun mood			0
' i like the tweaking the idea of how something should be ; wearing sparkles during the day , or a sweatshirt during the evening , or pairing a man 's trouser with a feminine blouse			0
' i like to twist the rules and to allow for that unexpected touch			0
' i like things to feel a touch unfinished ; sweatpants with heels , or tennis shoes with a trouser			0
