@entity0 will spearhead @entity2 ’s attack in @entity3 on saturday night with his position as @entity6 ’s no 9 beyond doubt			1
i played and trained with him at @entity9 and watched him develop further this season under @entity11			2
here ’s why @entity13 may have a problem on saturday night			0
he was , in my opinion , the finest finisher in the @entity19 last season			1
he only had the seventh best conversion rate ( 24.7 shots per goal ) of the 18 players who scored more than 10 — @entity24 was top with 16.1 — but @entity0 was electric			1
he 's electric : @entity0 ( second right ) celebrates scoring for @entity2 against @entity26 last month the biggest compliment i could pay him is that whenever he got a sight of goal , i had no doubt he would finish it off			1
there were all kinds of finishes , ranging from the spectacular — think of his chip against @entity36 at @entity37 last october — to the tap - ins all strikers thrive on			0
only against @entity40 in the @entity41 did he miss chances you ’d expect him to put away			0
he was off - target against @entity44 in the final warm - up game but he is a forward with confidence and belief			2
the value that adds to a team is huge			0
he ’ll relish this stage			0
if @entity2 go far , he could be an outside bet for the @entity52			1
chipping in : @entity0 scored all kinds of goals for @entity9 last season , including this dink against @entity36 dancing to his tune : @entity0 's celebration was seen more than a few times last season when he signed for @entity9 in january 2013 , we knew there were questions about his attitude			1
if that had n’t been the case , we would n’t have got him for £ 12million			0
had his reputation been good , @entity9 would have paid £ 30m for a striker of his quality			2
but i was happy @entity11 was prepared to give him a chance , as he was what we were looking for — a young , @entity73 lad with pace and ability			0
i honestly could n’t fault him during the six months that i worked with him			0
he was always a good lad in the dressing room and took his job seriously			1
even now when i watch from afar , he comes across well in the interviews he gives and says the right things about wanting to improve			0
good attitude : @entity0 has been happy and a breath of fresh air under @entity11 ( right ) at @entity9 there used to be ‘ arguments ’ between him and @entity85 at @entity86 over who was quickest and i ’m sure they are continuing in training with @entity2			1
what is n’t up for debate is the fact that @entity0 has pace to burn			1
speed frightens defenders more than anything and , if @entity0 uses his properly , it could be a potent weapon for @entity2			1
he has a change of a gear to get in behind top defences , as he showed when racing on to a @entity101 pass to score against @entity40 in february			0
he is quick off the mark and can leave people trailing			0
i felt at times he was conservative about how and when he made runs			0
if he is aggressive , it will give him another edge			0
@entity107 to burn : the speed of @entity0 ( left ) could be a potent weapon for @entity2 if he had @entity111 ’s mentality , @entity0 would be almost unstoppable			1
@entity111 is the type of player who will play through the pain barrier and wo n’t let a niggle keep him out of the action			1
@entity118 is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs			1
there was a feeling with @entity0 that everything had to be right for him to play			1
if a knock played on his mind , he would want it assessed to be sure he could play but in a @entity127 you do n’t have time to stop and think			2
you must play when you are not 100 per cent fit , you have to carry the bumps and bruises and put yourself on the line			2
if he can do this in the years to come , you could see him blossoming into one of @entity136 ’s best strikers			2
carry on regardless : @entity0 has to learn to play when he is not 100 per cent fit his goal record is outstanding — of players at the @entity127 only @entity118 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and saturday ’s opponent @entity142 bettered his tally of 21 league strikes last season			1
but there is much more to him			0
i knew from his early days in training he was a class act			0
it was the way he opened up his body to receive a pass , how he transferred his weight from one foot to another and moved quickly into position that struck a chord			2
some may say he is one - footed but left - footed players tend to be the ones with most natural ability			0
no question he has ability , now @entity0 must make the most of the opportunity in front of him			2
goal stars : @entity118 ( left ) , @entity141 ( right ) and @entity139 ( below ) bettered @entity0 's tally new pretenders : @entity140 ( left ) and @entity142 were the only other players to score more than @entity0			1

@entity0 was the finest finisher in the @entity19 last season
his position as @entity2 's no 9 is beyond doubt
@entity0 is good in the dressing room and has the right attitude
the forward 's speed could be a potent weapon for @entity2
@entity0 needs to learn to play through the pain barrier
last season , only @entity139 , @entity141 , @entity118 , @entity140 and @entity142 in @entity136 's major leagues scored more league goals
