by @entity0 published : 01:52 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 1 august 2013 @entity1 , who lost his glamorous wife to @entity4 star @entity3 a property tycoon who lost his glamorous wife to @entity7 target @entity3 has now lost the former family home too after a judge refused to halt its £ 5.475million sale to the footballer			1
@entity1 , 38 , whose former wife , @entity13 , gave birth to @entity3 ' baby in april , tried to block the sale on the basis that the @entity4 star 's offer was £ 2m less than its true value			1
the @entity21 listed @entity22 flat , just yards from @entity23 , had been ordered for sale as part of divorce proceedings , in order to provide money for @entity29 to buy her own home			1
but in an ' extraordinary ' twist , mr @entity1 soon learned it was her new boyfriend , the multi-millionaire footballer , who had put an offer on the table within three weeks of the flat going on the market			1
after the sale to @entity3 was approved by the @entity40 , mr @entity1 launched a last - ditch bid for time to look for a bid closer to his £ 7.5m valuation of the apartment , where his ex was still living			1
but after a @entity51 hearing , the footballer and his @entity49 girlfriend ran out winners when @entity53 threw out mr @entity1 's application to block the sale to the former @entity57 captain			1
miss @entity13 's claimed - in a witness statement read out by the judge - that , if she stays in @entity60 , she will not even be able to live in the flat when it is signed over to her boyfriend			2
quoting 38 - year - old @entity29 , who the court heard hopes to move to @entity67 , the judge said : ' once the former matrimonial home is sold , i will have no accommodation in @entity60			0
coincidence ? @entity3 ( left ) , with @entity13 , will now be able to buy the @entity21 listed @entity22 flat exclusive : a view of the central @entity60 street where the flat at the centre of the dispute is situated ' if the property is sold to mr @entity3 , it is my understanding that it will be used as an investment and rented out in order to cover the cost of the purchase , and / or generate some income			1
' after the divorce proceedings , the sale of the couple 's flat was put into miss @entity13 's hands by the @entity40 and the £ 5.475m sale to @entity3 was agreed , @entity53 said			1
but , on appeal , mr @entity1 's barrister , @entity92 , argued that there was clear evidence of several other interested parties , who were willing to pay much more but have been unable to view the flat while she is in it			2
' there 's credible prima facie evidence that this property can sell , and sell quickly , for a sum in the region of £ 7.5 million , ' he said			0
' there are five parties , all of whom have had absolutely no connection with the husband or his family , who have expressed interest in purchasing this property at £ 7.5m and all of whom have requested access for viewings , and all of whom are described by the proposed agents as being serious offers			0
' but , rejecting his case , the appeal judge said encouraging more offers would be a breach of the contract of sale already agreed with @entity3 , and that , while unsold , the £ 4.8 million mortgage is accruing interest of £ 1,000 - a - day			0
mr @entity1 previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife as her new boyfriend @entity3 , who is thought to earn £ 5m - a - year , has millions to lavish on her mr @entity1 had not objected to a sale of the flat to his mother , @entity137 , for a price similar to that being offered by the footballer , he continued			1
' the strongest point which mr @entity92 makes is that the judge appeared at times to proceed on the basis that the necessary consequence of allowing the sale of the flat to mr @entity3 will be that the family could remain in the flat , ' he continued			0
' the passage i have read from the wife 's statement could be read as suggesting that there is , in fact , no prospect of that solution being the case			0
' i am by no means convinced that that is the position			0
if the sale goes through to mr @entity3 , there will be a real possibility that the children will remain in the flat , in their home , and that remains a powerful factor in favour of allowing the sale to go ahead			2
' he rejected mr @entity1 's application for a stay on the sale , meaning it can now go ahead			1
mr @entity1 and his ex-wife married when they were 24 and living in @entity176			2
they had two children before their separation in 2011 , months after @entity29 was seen on holiday with the 25 - year - old footballer			0
mr @entity1 had previously objected to having to shell out for a home for his ex-wife in circumstances where her new boyfriend , who is thought to earn £ 5m - a - year , has millions to lavish on her			2
in a court hearing in april , he claimed she had significantly under - stated the financial support she would get from @entity3			0
she said his only obligation was to support their child and all she got was the price of flights , presents and being looked after when she is in @entity67			0
her evidence led family judge , mr @entity197 , to rule that the flat be sold			0
the proceeds , with a top - up from mr @entity1 , would provide her with the £ 1.4m she needed to find a home of her own .			2
