@entity0 has to consider bringing in enclosed cockpits to improve driver safety following the serious accident involving @entity4 , says @entity6 deputy team principal @entity5			1
autosport magazine claimed @entity6 's top teams rejected a move by the @entity10 last year to introduce closed cockpits because they felt the structures would make cars look ugly			1
@entity6 refused to confirm if that had been rejected but said the enclosed cockpits now had to be looked at			2
the idea of closed cockpits has been raised in light of @entity4 's crash at the @entity19 @entity18 speaking at the leaders in @entity23 conference in @entity24 , she said : ' i ca n't talk about what we discussed in our strategy group meetings			1
but safety is always on the agenda in @entity0			2
' enclosed cockpits are n't easy technically for us to integrate into a @entity0 car and of course they change the very nature of what a @entity0 car looks like			2
' we have to look at all the options available to us whether it 's an enclosed cockpit or not , but i think those conversations need to go on behind the scenes			0
@entity5 , deputy team principal of the @entity6 team , said drivers safety was of paramount importance ' safety is always paramount so we have to find ways to ensure our drivers are as protected as possible and i do n't think the aesthetics of a @entity0 car - yes they are important , they are the very fibre and dna of @entity0 - and what cars look like is important , but safety has to be paramount			1
' @entity4 remains in a ' critical but stable ' condition after he suffered a traumatic brain injury during a crash in last sunday 's @entity19 @entity18			1
the 25 - year - old @entity58 , who drives for @entity59 , remains on the intensive care unit at @entity61 in @entity19			0
@entity59 driver @entity4 spun off the road in treacherously wet conditions in @entity19 , and is still in hospital @entity6 said safety in @entity0 had moved on hugely since the death of @entity67 20 years ago			1
she added : ' our sport is dangerous at times , but a lot of work has been done behind the scenes in the past 20 years since @entity67 died at @entity74 in ' 94			0
' you see a lot of accidents in @entity0 where you do n't necessarily expect drivers to walk away and certainly prior to 20 years ago they would n't necessarily have done so			0
but a lot of work has been done and they do walk away in most scenarios now			0
' the @entity10 and the event organisers need to do a full analysis into the accident that happened on sunday and i think everyone 's concern in our sport at the moment is with @entity4 and his recovery			0

@entity4 suffered serious head injuries after @entity97 crash
the @entity100 driver is still in hospital in @entity19

@entity5 , deputy principal of the @entity6 team , *stressed* importance of driver safety but said closed cockpits not easy to fit on the cars
