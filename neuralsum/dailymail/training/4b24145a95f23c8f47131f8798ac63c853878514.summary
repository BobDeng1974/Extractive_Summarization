a grand jury indicted @entity2 gov. @entity1 on friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption – making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state 's first indicted governor in nearly a century			1
a special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting evidence that @entity1 broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $ 7.5 million of state budget funds earmarked to run the public integrity unit run by the office of @entity19 district attorney @entity18			1
@entity18 , a @entity20 , was convicted of drunk driving in april 2013 , but refused @entity1 's demand for her resignation after a judge handed down a sentence of 45 days in jail and a $ 4,000 fine			1
she served about half of her sentence and refused to step down			2
if she had resigned , @entity1 , a @entity30 , would have appointed her replacement – effectively taking over an office that has been run by @entity33 for decades			1
@entity18 is based in @entity53 , which is heavily @entity33 , in contrast to most of the rest of fiercely conservative @entity2			0
the grand jury was comprised of @entity53 - area residents			1
the unit @entity18 oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption and political wrongdoing , working from the state 's most liberal county			2
her office led the investigation against former @entity67 house majority leader @entity66 , a @entity2 @entity30 who in 2010 was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state			1
those convictions were later vacated by an appeals court in a 2 - 1 decision led by two republicans			0
delay never served his three - year prison sentence , since his bail was continued pending appeals			2
@entity18 's office has since demanded a judicial review to reinstate the conviction			1
she waived her right to appeal her own @entity45 conviction as part of the 2013 guilty plea that set @entity1 's wheels in motion			1
along with other high - profile republicans , @entity1 argued that @entity18 should resign after her humiliating and high - profile arrest and conviction			1
a video recording made at the jail showed @entity18 shouting at staffers to call the sheriff , kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out			2
her blood - alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for driving			1
officers ultimately had to strap her into a specialized ' restraint chair ' for her own safety			0
jailhouse video showed that when officers told @entity18 that she had been arrested for driving drunk , she shot back , ' that 's y'all 's problem , not mine			2
' ' y'all are gon na be in jail , not me , ' an intoxicated @entity18 insisted when deputies removed her jewelry during the booking process			2
eight months later , the @entity120 sued her in civil court to remove her from her job			0
judge @entity123 , visiting from a nearby county – every jurist in @entity19 had a conflict of interest – ruled in her favor			2
if prosecutors were to be removed from office for drunkenness , @entity123 declared from the bench , officials had ' better get busy ' impeaching officials all over the county and state			0
liberals statewide cheered the outcome , including gay - rights advocates who saw the confrontation through the lens of identity politics			0
@entity18 is openly gay , and @entity1 championed a 2005 @entity2 constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage			1
jailhouse footage showed an intoxicated @entity18 arguing with officers and threatening that they would wind up in jail for ' ruining my career ' after @entity18 repeatedly kicked the door of her holding cell and verbally abused officers , they strapped her into a ' restraint chair ' and later covered her face with a ' spit mask ' @entity1 stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the @entity40 , which @entity159 ( @entity158 ) runs			1
the governor made his threat in an attempt to get @entity18 to resign following her drunk driving conviction ( booking photo at right ) in 2013 @entity166 , @entity1 's general counsel , predicted on friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant			1
' the veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority afforded to every governor under the @entity178 , ' she said			0
@entity1 issued a public statement along with his veto , writing in june 2013 that ' [ d ] espite the otherwise good work [ of ] the @entity40 ’s employees , i can not in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public ’s confidence			1
' @entity194 , @entity1 's defense attorney , whose $ 450 - per hour fees are being paid for by state funds , said friday that he was outraged by the indictment			1
' this clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no legal basis in this decision , ' @entity194 said in a statement			0
' today 's action , which violates the separation of powers outlined in the @entity178 , is nothing more than an effort to weaken the constitutional authority granted to the office of @entity2 governor , and sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the @entity2 governor			1
' several top aides to @entity1 appeared before grand jurors , including his deputy chief of staff , legislative director and general counsel			2
@entity1 himself was not called to testify			0
abuse of official capacity is a first - degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison			0
coercion of a public servant is a third - degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years			0
in office since 2000 and already the longest - serving governor in @entity2 history , @entity1 is n't seeking re-election in november			1
@entity18 was arrested in april 2013 for drunk driving and sentenced to 45 days in jail after she failed field sobriety tests ( above ) and tests showed her blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit @entity18 refused to step down after her conviction , despite @entity1 's demand , and the governor followed through on a threat to veto state funding for the ' public integrity ' prosecution division she heads when he ran for president in 2012 , @entity1 plummeted from brief front - runner to national punchline , his once promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes			1
his most infamous ' @entity256 ' moment came during a primary debate when he could n't remember which three cabinet - level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to win the @entity259			2
as he eyes another run , @entity1 has re-made his cowboy image , donning stylish glasses , studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and promising conservatives nationally that he 's far more humble this time around			0
political observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with @entity30 primary voters – but @entity33 did n't miss a change to gloat friday			0
@entity273 deserve real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor , ' @entity272 chairman @entity271 said in a statement			0
he demanded that @entity1 immediately resign			0
@entity278 , a former @entity1 chief of staff who took on spokesman duties during the 2012 presidential primary season , told the @entity281 that friday 's indictment ' certainly will be a big deal with the liberal media – @entity285 , salon – and therefore for the national media			1
' ' it is beyond ridiculous , ' @entity278 said , ' that @entity19 is pursuing the governor , after letting the seriously drunk , police - disrespecting da stay in office			2
' no one disputes that @entity1 is allowed to veto measures approved by the state legislature			0
but the liberal @entity297 government watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of coercion because he threatened to use his veto – before actually doing so – in an attempt to pressure @entity18 to quit			2
almost immediately after news of his indictment broke , gov. @entity1 continued putting out red - meat messages for his conservative @entity308 audience , continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016 ' we 're pleased that the grand jury determined that the governor 's bullying crossed the line into illegal behavior , ' said @entity317 , executive director of @entity297			1
' the complaint had merit , serious laws were potentially broken			0
' @entity321 , the @entity322 - based special prosecutor , said he ' took into account the fact that we 're talking about a governor of a state – and a governor of the state of @entity2 , which we all love			0
' ' obviously that carries a lot of importance , ' @entity321 said			0
' but when it gets down to it , the law is the law			0
' @entity321 said he 'll meet with @entity338 on monday to discuss when he will come to the courthouse to be arraigned			0
@entity321 said he does n't know when @entity1 will be booked			0
although @entity321 called more than 40 witnesses before the grand jury , @entity1 was not among them – a decision likely to add to a fast - growing controversy			1
' that 's prosecutorial discretion that i had , ' he told the @entity347 on friday			0
@entity321 's control of the @entity350 grand jury became another political hot potato when he was named to the post : president @entity353 had nominated him to serve as a federal prosecutor , but he withdrew his name from consideration after 11 months had passed without the @entity357 taking action to confirm him			1
@entity1 's indictment is the first of its kind since 1917 , when @entity362 was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state funding to the @entity366 in an effort to unseat faculty and staff members he objected to			1
@entity362 was eventually impeached , then resigned before being convicted .			0

@entity19 grand jury never heard *testimony* from the @entity30 governor , but indicted him on two charges that he abused his position
@entity1 is accused of trying to force ' public integrity section ' prosecutor @entity18 to resign by threatening to veto funding for her office
he *wanted* @entity18 to step down after she was convicted of @entity45 in a case where her blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit
@entity18 served about half of a 45 - day jail sentence and stayed in office ; @entity1 nixed her agency 's funding as he had promised to do
@entity1 was considered a potential @entity30 *candidate* for the 2016 presidential election , but the indictment may hinder his chances
@entity18 's office was also behind the corruption prosecution of former @entity67 @entity399 ' @entity400 , whose conviction was later thrown out by a three - judge appeals panel
