@entity6 , a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher @entity7 , has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997			1
a new book by terrorism expert @entity12 has now found that since its formation in the 1980s , the group has been central to @entity16 extremism in the @entity3			1
more than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the @entity3 - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network @entity6 in a new report it is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997 , when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer			1
at least one of the bombers who carried out @entity30 's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of @entity6 , @entity32 , before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005			1
@entity37 and @entity38 , who murdered fusilier @entity39 in a street in @entity41 , south - east @entity30 in 2013 , had both attended events organised by the group			1

he added : ' these people are very good at being in the periphery and the background without ever having their hands on the device or being directly implicated in plots , which would see them given heavier sentences			2
' i think constant disruption of the group is not a bad thing			2
by proscribing these groups you force them to change their name , their website , which inhibits them , also by arresting them on more minor charges you take them off the streets for a time			0
