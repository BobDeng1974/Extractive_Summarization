by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 12 march 2012 @entity2 's nemesis @entity1 may be fictional , but his love of gold is a real phenomenon			0
in fact , if the villain was alive and had £ 5m to spare , this might have been his next purchase - a @entity9 decked out inside and out with 120kg of gold			1
this @entity11 - worth around £ 330,000 by itself - has been turned into a golden tribute for a mega-rich @entity15 business man by designer @entity17 - based @entity16			1
with gold worth more than £ 3m lavished on the vehicle - plus other customised work to make the car both bullet and grenade - proof - the value of the car is now close to £ 5.2m			2
one of a kind : the gold - plated @entity11 , worth more than £ 5m , has been customised for a businessman in the @entity15 face of gold : the @entity9 has been trimmed with gold and is also bullet - proof @entity17 gold designer @entity16 created the masterpiece of a vehicle in total , 120kg of solid 18 - carat gold has been applied to the car both inside and out			1
the outside trims have all been decked with gold , and for the inside , molds were made of all the fixtures , and then used to plate the interior			0
the @entity45 designer has made a name for himself by apparently turning the most improbable of items into gold - decked luxury goods			1
previously , he is said to have ' blinged ' @entity50 , @entity51 , and even a miniature version of a @entity53 , which , at a value of £ 2m , costs almost twice as much as the real thing			0
the value of the @entity11 may make it tempting to thieves - but think twice if you are tempted , as the @entity11 is about as bullet - proof proof as they come			0
@entity62 company @entity61 , based in @entity63 , approached mr @entity16 for the project , and while he carried out the gold work , @entity61 set about making the car practically indestructible			0
the vehicle can withstand more than 570 rounds fired into it from an @entity71 assault rifle , as well as attacks from two hand grenades , meaning that unless the anonymous owner leaves the keys in the ignition , this car is likely to withstand any situations			1
@entity79 is golden : the leather interior is trimmed with gold , with every item in the car getting a moulded gold fascia the back view : most drivers might turn a shade of green if they see this ever see this view through the windscreen @entity91 takes on the ' gold standard ' of film enemies - @entity94 as @entity1 - in the 1964 @entity2 classic however , the @entity11 is by no means the most expensive car ever sold - just last month a classic @entity97 changed hands for £ 20.2million			2
the legendary @entity99 is the world ’s most sought - after car , especially as there were only 39 models built between 1962 and 1964			0
this 1963 model - number 5095 - is believed to have been sold by @entity45 businessman @entity105 , who bought it in 2008 for what was then world - record at £ 15.7million .			2

£ 5m @entity11 can withstand 570 rounds from an @entity71 assault rifle - and two grenades
