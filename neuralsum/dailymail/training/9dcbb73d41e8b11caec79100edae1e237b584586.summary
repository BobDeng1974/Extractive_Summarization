but despite his behavior , he was hired by @entity22 , kept on during massive job cuts and could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm 's queries			1

now , federal prosecutors are looking at @entity1 's hiring as a potential violation of the @entity38 , according to the @entity31 , which cited people with knowledge of the inquiry			2
the @entity38 bans giving anything of value to foreign government officials to get ahead in business			0
prosecutors are investigating the @entity48 hiring practices of @entity2 and other banks			1
@entity2 's decision to hire @entity1 in the summer of 2007 was reportedly ' widely understood ' within the company to have been supported by @entity52 , a senior executive at the bank at the time			1
mr @entity52 , who worked at @entity2 from 2004 to 2010 , is also a former @entity55 commerce secretary and served as white house chief of staff to president @entity57 from january 2011 to january 2012			2

at the time , @entity1 was in his final year at @entity58			0
the meeting was apparently set up by @entity60 , a @entity61 - based @entity2 banker , who had previously advised mr @entity62 a ' good in - depth relationship ' with @entity5 would be beneficial to the firm			2
mr @entity52 later told ms @entity60 his meeting with @entity4 - who was promoted to his current position as minister in march 2013 after a high - flying career - had been ' very good ' , according to the emails			2
making promises : @entity1 reportedly performed poorly in job interviews and was described by a senior banker as ' immature , irresponsible and unreliable '			1
but despite this , he was kept on by @entity2 after his father ( pictured , left , with @entity55 treasury secretary @entity76 ) promised to ' go extra miles ' for the bank bank : on one occasion , @entity1 , 32 , even accidentally sent a sexually explicit email to a human - resources employee at @entity2 ( file image ) , for which he was given a warning , according to internal emails several months later , @entity1 was offered a two - year analyst position at @entity2 in @entity87			1
despite the offer , the candidate was said to have performed abysmally in his interviews			0
one recruiter , @entity91 , detailed @entity1 's performance in an email to her colleagues			0
according to the @entity31 , she wrote : ' @entity1 did very very poorly in interviews - some @entity95 ( managing directors ) said he was the worst @entity97 ( business analyst ) candidate they had ever seen - and we obviously had to extend him an offer			1
' during his time at @entity2 , @entity1 was accused of performing ' poorly ' and behaving in an ' irresponsible and inappropriate ' manner			2
below are some of his alleged offenses - and his subsequent treatment by the company			0
alleged behavior - performed poorly in job interviews ( some managing directors reportedly said he was the worst @entity97 candidate they had ever seen ) - failed to renew his work visa , so the bank had to help him apply for an h - 3 training visa , which prohibits ' productive employment ' - was described by a senior banker as ' immature , irresponsible and unreliable '			1
- sent a sexually explicit email to a human - resources employee at the firm treatment by @entity2 - was hired by the company following his ' poor ' interview performance - was kept on amid major job cuts - could have later been offered another position if he had replied to the firm 's queries - was given a written warning for the sexually explicit email nearly a year later , @entity1 received a layoff notice from @entity2 alongside many of his colleagues			1
however , after his father reportedly intervened , he was saved from being let go			0
' the father indicated to me repeatedly that he is willing to go extra miles to help @entity22 in whatever way we think he can , ' @entity130 , then ceo of @entity5 investment banking for the firm , wrote			2
he added : ' and i do have a few cases where i think we can leverage the father â€™s connection			0
' during @entity1 's time at @entity2 ( he was eventually terminated in march 2009 amid major job cuts and now works for @entity144 ) , he allegedly made a number of mistakes			1
one of these was letting his work visa expire , so the bank had to help him apply for an h - 3 training visa , which prohibits ' productive employment ' , according to the emails seen by the @entity31			0
another was inadvertently copying a @entity155 employee into an email featuring inappropriate sexual remarks , it is claimed			0
this move led to @entity1 being handed a final written warning			0
' @entity1 was given a written ( last ) warning last friday and advised that his conduct and activities will be monitored closely and any further violation would lead to termination , ' @entity160 , a @entity87 - based senior banker who handled @entity48 clients , wrote to mr @entity130 in an email			1
' that said , ' he added , ' there is general consensus among the seniors in our group as well reports from people in his previous group that he is immature , irresponsible and unreliable			0
' despite his behavior , @entity1 was repeatedly saved from being fired , it is alleged			0
at one point , mr @entity130 apparently asked mr @entity160 if he would take the employee onto his team of analysts			0
and later , the firm was reportedly prepared to offer him a position on a different scheme			0
but amid the support for @entity1 , mr @entity52 reportedly declined to help save his job , saying he should ' move on '			2
' involved : @entity1 's hiring was reportedly ' widely understood ' within the company to have been supported by @entity52 ( left ) , a senior executive at the time			1
meanwhile , @entity130 ( right ) , then ceo of @entity5 investment banking for @entity2 , reportedly said the firm could ' leverage [ @entity4 's ] connection ' @entity2 ( which mr @entity130 has since left ) , mr @entity52 ( who is now in charge of @entity55 operations at a @entity199 hedge fund ) , @entity4 and his son are not accused of any wrongdoing , it is reported			1
@entity1 's name had not previously been reported in connection with the hiring probe , which @entity2 disclosed in a 2013 regulatory filing			2
a @entity2 spokesman declined to comment			0
th 2013 filing , which was part of a probe by the @entity209 and the @entity210 in the @entity55 , has damaged @entity2 's business in @entity48 , according to the @entity212 the bank pulled out of two high - profile initial public offerings , @entity215 and @entity216			1
a @entity144 spokesman also declined comment			0
mr @entity52 - whom two employees referred to as being supportive of @entity1 's initial hiring in emails - refused to discuss @entity48 hiring practices			1
former role : mr @entity52 , who worked at @entity22 from 2004 to 2010 , is also a former @entity55 commerce secretary and served as white house chief of staff to president @entity57 ( pictured , right , with mr @entity52 ) in 2011 despite the email claims about mr @entity52 , the former @entity2 chairman of the @entity228 did not have an ongoing relationship with @entity1 nor his father , a person familiar with the matter said			1
the @entity5 commerce ministry is not a client of @entity2 nor a banking regulator , but can rule on mergers among multinational companies that do business in @entity5 , the @entity31 reporrted			0
the @entity210 and the @entity209 are expected to reach a settlement with @entity2 related to the @entity55 antibribery law			0
this may involve a fine			0
it could also reportedly warrant an overhaul of the bank 's hiring practices			0
