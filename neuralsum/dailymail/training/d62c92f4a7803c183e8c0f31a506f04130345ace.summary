by @entity0 an @entity2 family are appealing for help after their baby boy was born with webbed fingers and toes			1
@entity9 's grandmother , @entity8 , is behind a @entity11 page to raise at least $ 10,000 for the two - month - old 's much - needed reconstructive surgery and the support he 'll need as he heals			1
@entity9 was born with a rare condition that melds his fingers and toes together called split - hand split - foot malformation			1
it means that he is missing some digits , while others are fused together			0
both of his hands and feet are affected , which doctors told the family only happens in one in a million cases			2
' when my daughter heard that , she cried : " my baby boy is one in a million ! " , ' @entity28 told @entity34 , laughing			1
' they could not be more happy with their son			0
we would not trade him for the world			0
the grandmother is now trying to raise money to support the family as the little boy undergoes surgeries , which need to be carried out as soon as possible to ensure that the boy can adapt to his new hands and feet			1
' my job as his grandma is to support his family , ' said @entity28 , who works for @entity63			0
' obviously he 's my grandson but he is perfect			0
he melts the heart of everyone he meets			0
i could n't be more proud of him			0
' the family is hoping they can raise enough money on the fundraising website , which has already reached $ 5,000			1
some of the costs will be covered by @entity71 , but the family will be left to foot the bill for further tests , as well as travel expenses			2
proud : his grandmother , @entity8 , pictured , has launched an online fundraising campaign for his care ' long road ahead ' : prints show the boy 's foot and hands ; in surgery , his fused fingers will be separated and straightened , while the clefts down the middle of his hands will have to be closed split hand / split foot malformation , also known as ectrodactyly , is a genetic disorder in which some fingers or toes are completely or partially absent , often combined with clefts in the hands or feet			1
there may also be the appearance of webbing between fingers or toes , which is called syndactyly			1
the appearance may make the hands or feet look like claws			0
it is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed			2
the incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on the used classification , but because both of @entity9 's hands and feet are affected , doctors said his case is one in a million			1
surgery can be carried out to improve function of the fingers and thumb and to reduce the webbing between fingers			2
his parents both work full time - 28 - year - old @entity125 at a bank and 25 - year - old @entity127 at a hospital - but @entity28 predicts that they will have to take leaves of absence from work			2
' the only way he 's going to thrive is in the arms of his mom , ' @entity28 said			0
' there 's no way she can work full time and look after an infant as he goes through all of these surgeries			2
' @entity28 said she expects that it will take more than a year for her grandson to undergo surgeries and plastic surgery , which should leave him able to walk once he 's old enough			2
' his fused fingers on his left hand need to be separated and straightened , and the cleft ( gap ) where both hands and feet split in utero , will need to be surgically closed , ' she explained on the site			1
she added that his pointer fingers each have an extra bone , which will need to be shaved down			2
the doctors will carry out the surgery in stages - first focusing on his left hand and foot before moving on to his right hand and foot			1
it means that @entity28 wants to raise enough money to help her family as soon as she can , and she said she has been overwhelmed by the response from family , friends , colleagues and strangers			1
' he has so many family members in @entity173 that have never had the opportunity to meet him , ' she said			0
' they decided to take the money they were going to spend on visiting him and put it towards his care instead			1
that is an amazing gesture			0
' cute : the bouncing baby boy requires reconstructive surgery on both hands and feet as soon as possible so that he can adapt to them			0
doctors usually leave it later but want to move quickly in @entity9 's severe case happy : both of his parents , pictured , will have to take time off work as they help him with his recovery , @entity28 said after the surgeries and reconstructive procedures , the family will also undergo genetic testing to deduce how likely @entity9 is to pass it on to his own children			1
the boy 's mother , @entity127 , had six ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy and the deformity was never detected			0
@entity28 said there is also no family history of the condition			0
after the testing - which could cost upwards of $ 12,000 , @entity28 said - the family hope to work to spread awareness of the condition in his community and further afield			1
' we 've got a long road ahead of us but @entity9 has the most amazing parents and is surrounded by so much love , ' @entity28 said			1
' when i look at him , i do n't see difference , i see ability			0
he 's going to thrive and how cool is that ? ' the family has a @entity225 bank account under the name ' @entity227 ' or you can visit the site .			0
