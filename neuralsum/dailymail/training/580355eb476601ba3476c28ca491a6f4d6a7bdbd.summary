it is rare for @entity1 , the @entity2 chairman , to attend the club ’s training ground			1
but when there is serious business to sort , he appears			0
business such as finding a fourth permanent head coach in little more than a year			1
as stand - ins @entity10 and @entity12 put the players through their paces on tuesday , @entity1 ’s personalised number plate was visible in the car park			1
he started the day in negotiations with two possible replacements for @entity18 , sacked late on monday night and placed on gardening leave , just as @entity20 was 12 months ago			1
@entity22 's representatives are in talks with @entity2 over the vacant manager 's position @entity1 ( right ) , the @entity2 owner , is looking for his fourth head coach in little more than a year @entity18 ( above ) was sacked as first team coach by @entity2 on monday evening @entity22 and @entity28 were the only two candidates spoken to — and on tuesday night @entity22 was on the brink of accepting the job			1
the plan is for him to be appointed in time for the @entity34 third - round tie against @entity35 on saturday			0
hurdles appear to have been overcome , too			0
former @entity37 manager @entity22 has always made it plain that he would want full control over transfers and the imminent appointment perhaps illustrates that @entity42 is ready to give a little in his demands			1
for the past eight years @entity1 ’s preferred , trusted hierarchy sees a head coach taking care of training , with player recruitment left to a technical director — @entity50 in this situation			1
having taken over at @entity2 in 2002 , @entity1 grew concerned about @entity54 football ’s traditional managerial model			1
he did not like the fact a manager would identify talent and insist on certain individuals			0
@entity1 has been through 12 managers during his time as @entity2 owner @entity22 working for @entity62 ahead of the @entity64 v @entity37 match earlier this month former @entity65 boss @entity28 is also in contention for the job at @entity2 nor did he think it was healthy to have a manager bringing an array of staff into a club and then leading a mass exodus when a parting of the ways arrived			1
peace embarked on a tour of @entity78 , eager to see how the likes of @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 operated			0
‘ the sporting director role was evident in all of the clubs , ’ said @entity1 in a rare interview with @entity85 last year			1
they were all looking at @entity54 saying , “ we can not understand what ’s going on when we deal with @entity54			0
the clubs there pay top price , they do n’t really check what they are buying ”			0
’ peace reached a watershed with @entity97 in charge — unsatisfied with his player recommendations — and decided to implement the continental structure he employs to this day			0
@entity50 ’s appointment in the summer looked to have strengthened @entity1 ’s resolve over the arrangement			1
defender @entity105 looks dejected after @entity2 conceded the second goal to @entity107 on sunday forward @entity108 scores the opening goal of @entity107 's win against @entity2 the former @entity112 manager , who arrived from heading @entity114 ’s development teams , works alongside sporting director @entity115			1
essentially , @entity50 seeks out the talent — with the aid of @entity2 ’s scouting network — and @entity115 gets deals over the line , concentrating on finances			2
the role had been a single one occupied by @entity123 before he left for the @entity34 in september 2012			0
in this structure , @entity18 was solely responsible for training the players and picking the team			2
@entity22 , however , will want to enter @entity127 as the principal man and instructed his advisers to make that point to @entity131			2
he walked away from @entity37 on the eve of the season because he was frustrated that transfer targets he identified had not materialised			0
informed observers expressed shock at any softening of @entity1 ’s methods			2
but maybe , driven to keep @entity2 among the riches of the @entity140 , he has opened up to compromise			1
technical director @entity50 ( left ) at @entity143 's unveiling was brought in from @entity114 last summer club record signing @entity144 ( centre ) has been a major disappointment since joining in the summer the 58 - year - old ’s worst nightmare would be relegation to the @entity150			0
he has built the club into a sustainable business by running such a tight ship that gym equipment is rented rather than bought because fashions can change			0
@entity2 turned a £ 6million profit in the latest financial accounts			2
even with players having to take a 50 per cent cut in wages in the event of relegation , @entity1 would find such a prospect unpalatable			2
@entity28 , the former @entity65 manager , was an option , and he was approached about taking over when @entity164			2
@entity18 acknowledges the crowd at his home debut back in august at the start of the season on that occasion the wages @entity28 wanted for his right - hand man proved the stumbling block to his appointment			1
@entity22 has won that battle , too			2
the 56 - year - old will be joined by long - serving assistant @entity176 , who is based in @entity177			0
@entity18 was a popular figure and his training methods were liked			0
but , as one well - placed source put it , ‘ he was just a head coach ’			1
there is an inevitable problem that players , perhaps subconsciously , will not treat the coach charged with inspiring results the same as they would a manager			0
despite all his battles won with previous incumbents , it is something @entity42 appears to be willing to shift on to land @entity193			0
former @entity65 manager @entity28 is the favourite to replace @entity18 at the @entity127 former @entity37 manager @entity22 is looking for a new club and could head to the @entity127			1

@entity18 was sacked as @entity2 boss on monday
@entity22 has *emerged* as the favourite to become new head coach
@entity28 also in the running but @entity204 has edged ahead of him
@entity2 owner @entity1 determined to keep side in @entity140
@entity2 searching for fourth head coach in little more than a year
