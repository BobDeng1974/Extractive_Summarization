by @entity0 last updated at 12:40 pm on 22nd february 2012 she has been dubbed the ' trailer park @entity2 ' - an attractive ex-stripper recruited by the feds to implicate twin brothers accused of a white - supremacist bombing			1
she moved into the same @entity8 campground , talked like a separatist and sent them racy photos of herself to win over the men 's confidence over a five - year period			1
as the trial of @entity17 and @entity18 drew to a close , defense attorneys are arguing that the government 's conduct was outrageous and that her actions amounted to sexual entrapment			1
' trailer park @entity2 ' : a courtroom sketch showing ex-stripper - turned federal informant @entity25 as she gives evidence in the trial of two white supremacist brothers accused of bombing a black official in @entity30 but during closing arguments yesterday , prosecutor @entity31 told the jury that the hiring of the informant - identified in court records as @entity37 - was ' entirely permissible and necessary ' to the investigation of the 61 - year - olds			1
' there was no use of sex to obtain evidence , ' he said			1
the jury began deliberating whether to convict the brothers , who have pleaded not guilty , after closing statements ended late last yesterday			0
a verdict is expected by the end of next week			0
the brothers are accused of sending a package bomb in 2004 that maimed @entity50 , a black man who was the diversity director for the @entity52 suburb of @entity53 at the time			1
entrapped ? defense lawyers for @entity17 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) claim the government have used ' outrageous ' methods in their attempt to convict the twins @entity50 , 54 , was hospitalized for three days after the bombing and needed four operations on his hand and arm			1
the bombing also wounded a secretary			0
@entity31 said the @entity66 were believers in ' racial terrorism and violence as a way to accomplish their goals			0
' the trial , which began on january 10 , has been filled with drama as @entity37 took the stand for several days , and @entity50 himself described the bombing in detail for the jury			2
the real @entity2 : the @entity79 exotic dancer was executed by @entity80 in 1917 for spying on @entity81 @entity37 , who is 20 years younger than the @entity66 , said agents with the federal @entity83 recruited her after they worked with her brother , himself an informant , to infiltrate the @entity87 motorcycle gang			2
at the time , @entity37 testified , she was about to be evicted from her trailer and needed the money			0
she received a total of $ 45,000 , including expenses , and said she was promised $ 100,000 upon the @entity66 ' conviction			2
investigators had her pose as a separatist who was fleeing an arrest warrant and was interested in learning about @entity99 resistance and how to make a bomb so she could use one on a child molester she knew			0
the story was a fabrication designed to get the brothers to open up about the @entity53 bombing			0
@entity37 also gave the @entity66 at least two racy photos — one that showed her in a black leather vest , fishnet stockings , chaps and a @entity114 flag bikini bottom , along with a note that read : ' thought you 'd love the butt shot			1
' another photo showed her in a white bikini top , a grenade hanging between her breasts , as she posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika			1
prosecutors said the brothers belonged to the @entity127 , an organization that encourages members to act as ' lone wolves ' and commit violence against non-whites and the government			2
they played for jurors hundreds of hours of video and audio surveillance of the brothers and @entity37			0
@entity137 : the @entity66 deny orchestrating the delivery of a package that detonated in the hands of former @entity53 diversity director @entity50 ( above ) @entity37 testified last month , wearing a gray pantsuit with a dress shirt buttoned up to her neck and black high heels , her long , dark hair pinned up			0
under tense cross-examination , she acknowledged previously being an exotic dancer and became bashful when asked whether she knows how to use her body around men			0
the ' @entity2 ' nickname that the defense gave her at the beginning of the trial is a reference to the exotic dancer convicted of working as a spy for @entity81 during @entity155 during closing arguments , defense attorney @entity156 accused the government of acting like a ' pimp ' to get the @entity66 talking			1
scene : @entity17 and @entity18 were arrested at their home in @entity163 , @entity164 ( pictured ) on the move : the @entity167 brothers were living in @entity168 in the months before the 2004 bombing , but relocated to @entity170 , where the @entity171 sent their informant ' what you have in @entity175 is a loud - mouth — sometimes drunk ... and looking for the attentions of a younger woman who throws herself at him , and she works him like she once worked a pole , ' @entity156 said			1
' and of course he fell for it			0
' the defense attorney also referred to footage of the informant covering up a video camera with a towel after a naked @entity175 got into her hotel bed			2
prosecutors said @entity25 gave him a foot rub ; the defense attorney said that was ridiculous			2
' the whole investigation was scripted around sex , sex and more sex , from the grenade between the breasts to the sleeping with him , ' @entity156 said			1
judge @entity201 urged jurors to exercise particular caution when considering @entity37 ' testimony , since she was paid for her involvement			0
the @entity66 , who were living in the @entity52 area at the time of the bombing , but left days afterward and were arrested in 2009 in @entity209 , @entity164 , are charged with various explosives - related offenses , including conspiracy to damage buildings and property .			0
