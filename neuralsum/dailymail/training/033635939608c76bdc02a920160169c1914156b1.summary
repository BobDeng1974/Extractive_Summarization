a retired decorator has painted his whole council house in the style of the @entity3 and is using celebrities as models for his versions of priceless @entity8 paintings			1
@entity9 , who lives in a £ 93 - per - week rented home in @entity11 , @entity12 , has depicted @entity13 as @entity14 , @entity15 in prayer and @entity17 as @entity19 's @entity18			1
the only hint of what is within the 1960s terrace is the @entity8 decorations he has added to his green wheelie bin , and his house number is in roman numerals			0
the 66 - year - old 's ten - year project is all the more impressive because he has never been to @entity30 and has never been taught art. when @entity32 meets @entity11 : retired painter and decorator @entity9 has painted his council house to look like the @entity3 renaissance man : mr @entity9 has used celebrities as his muses , including comedian @entity13 as @entity14 , and even his wheelie bin is decorated spectacularly no clue : despite the fantastical painting and decorating inside the building , the outside of this humble terrace shows no signs of mr @entity9 ' flair for art @entity48 - of - three mr @entity9 , 66 , said : ' i get inspired when i see a celebrity offering themselves in a @entity8 pose			1
' i used the @entity13 picture from the front of a magazine , i thought he looked like @entity14			1
' i just put the crown of thorns on his head			0
' it is the camera angle that inspires me			0
' he added : ' i do n't follow football but when i found out @entity17 calls himself ' @entity17 ' i knew i had to do him next			1
' he is extremely photogenic , there was this photograph and i thought , ' he looks just like the @entity18 photo '			0
' @entity18 means @entity64 , i think it suits him very well			0
' incredible : the ceilings of his council house have renaissance scenes simlar to those found in @entity32 , but this one is in his upstairs loo magnificent : the grandfather - of - three and former decorator has painted his entire home in this style , although the spare room still needs some work inspired by the stars : his religious art includes @entity15 in the style of @entity83 by @entity84 and ' the special one ' @entity17 he has also painted @entity15 in the style of @entity83 by @entity84 after seeing him in prayer			1
mr @entity9 describes the picture as ' the ultimate hoody '			2
mr @entity9 has famously painted the entirety of the inside of his terrace home with elaborate frescoes inspired by 15th century @entity30 painters			1
every surface in his house - bar the spare room - shows a gilt - edged nativity scene , cherub or picture of the @entity99			2
in the last year mr @entity9 has also dedicated his bathroom to the @entity8 style - in fact there is just one room in his three - bedroom house not yet decorated			2
his bathroom has pictures inspired by @entity107 by @entity108 and @entity109 by @entity110 the ceiling is painted with a version of the @entity113 by @entity114			0
talented : mr @entity9 started work on the house in 2003 and ten years on he admits that if he were to leave the house he would want to take his artworks with him , but knows he ca n't magic : his bathroom has pictures inspired by @entity107 by @entity108 and @entity109 by @entity110 the ceiling is painted with a version of the @entity113 by @entity114 eye for art : despite his passion for the renaissance mr @entity9 has never visited @entity30 to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art he first started decorating his home in 2003 and in the last decade has dedicated hours to transforming boring magnolia walls into works of art. mr @entity9 said : ' the spare room is still waiting to be painted			1
' that will be the next project			0
' i have recently completed an altar piece in the bedroom			0
' i 'm really pleased with how it has all turned out			0
' as the work is painted onto plaster if mr @entity9 ever moves he will be unable to take his work of art with him			1
despite his passion for the @entity8 mr @entity9 has never visited @entity30 to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art. instead he is inspired by books on art and especially on the @entity150 he picks up at car boot sales			2
he says his children and grandchildren are used to visiting the house now and ' hardly notice it anymore ' .			0

@entity9 , 66 , has spent ten years turning his £ 93 - per - week council home into a giant work of art
he has used celebrities as his muses , with @entity13 as @entity14 and @entity15 as @entity83
' i do n't follow football but when i found out @entity17 calls himself " @entity17 " i knew i had to do him next '
