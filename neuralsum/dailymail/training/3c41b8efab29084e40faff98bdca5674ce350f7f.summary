@entity0 suffered a hat - trick of heartbreaks after defeat to @entity4 denied them @entity6 bronze			1
a day after blowing their chances of making the gold medal match for the first time in the dying seconds against @entity12 , @entity8 ' side went down 52 - 48 at the @entity13 to miss out on a medal			1
this match also looked set to go to the wire with the scores level at 37 - 37 going into the final quarter , but @entity0 's level dropped when it mattered most as they slipped from 48 - 47 behind to 51 - 47 down and from that point there was no way back			1
both of those matches were lost by a single point			0
this time @entity0 , bronze medallists at the last two @entity40 , were just not good enough			2
@entity41 , whose error proved so costly against @entity12 , responded with 22 goals from 26 attempts , while @entity45 scored 26 from 29 , but it was @entity47 's 44 from 52 for @entity4 , including 15 in the final quarter , which proved invaluable			1
bruising encounter : @entity0 's @entity45 ( centre ) gets pressured by @entity4 's defence ' today we did n't bring it , ' said goalkeeper @entity55 , who was left battered and bruised by a physical contest			1
' @entity4 were the best team on the day , they held strong all the way through and withstood the pressure we kept applying , but we did n't capitalise when we did get that ball			2
' it was very physical , you can tell that from my fat lip and i 've got a shiner coming up as well			0
it 's a shame the umpires ca n't see the retaliation , but we just have to withstand that			0
we have to be quick enough and skilful enough to be able to lose the body so we do n't get caught in the face			0
' yesterday 's was definitely ( harder to swallow )			0
i 'm not even upset , i think it just sums up this tournament for me			0
anger will probably start to set in and a few different emotions , but at the moment i am pretty emotionless			0
' on the ball : @entity0 's @entity80 looks to pass to a team - mate against @entity4 @entity4 were well - beaten 57 - 42 in their semi-final by the @entity35 team @entity0 ran so close , but made changes for sunday 's clash and they worked			1
@entity0 led 13 - 11 after the first quarter , trailed 25 - 24 at halfway and were back level at the end of the third period as the momentum swung from one side to the other			2
that run of three unanswered goals in the final period left @entity0 with too much to do , though , and had the @entity4 substitutes celebrating at the side of the court as the clock counted down			1
golden girls : @entity35 are the 2014 @entity6 netball champions after beating @entity12 @entity8 said : ' i think we were a little bit tentative , a little bit nervous , especially in that first half			1
we did wear them down defensively , but we just were n't clinical enough when we needed to be			0
' they fed @entity47 well , they converted when they needed to and she rebounded well when she missed , so that was difficult			2
' @entity35 ended @entity12 's reign as @entity6 champions by claiming gold with a convincing 58 - 40 win in the final			2
class above : @entity35 ran out 58 - 40 winners against the 2010 champions in a convincing final video @entity24 a ' stand - out games ' - @entity25			0

@entity0 miss out on netball @entity6 bronze to @entity4
@entity8 ' side lost 52 - 48 at the @entity13
@entity47 scored 44 from 52 to lead her team to bronze
