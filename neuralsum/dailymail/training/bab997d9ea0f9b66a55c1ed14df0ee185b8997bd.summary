by @entity0 last updated at 12:06 am on 8th november 2011 ministers have been criticised for writing off opponents of a controversial high - speed rail route as @entity4 and @entity5			0
the rebuke came from the @entity7 , even as it gave broad support for the £ 34billion @entity10 project			1
yesterday the committee said the route would be ‘ a catalyst for economic benefits ’ and added that there was a ‘ good case ’ for expansion beyond @entity18 to the @entity19 and @entity20			1
not on their backyard : an @entity24 sign in picturesque @entity25 in @entity26 but it also urged supporters of the scheme to stop ridiculing their opponents as wealthy , selfish homeowners who care more about their lawns than the fate of the economy – and warned that there could indeed be ‘ a substantial negative impact on the countryside ’			0
@entity10 , which would run through areas of outstanding natural beauty in the @entity40 and @entity41 , faces bitter opposition from residents and councils			1
former transport secretary @entity45 frequently described @entity10 ’s detractors as @entity4 and @entity5 , and in june the ‘ yes to @entity10 ’ campaign paid for posters on buses and trains which asked : ‘ their lawns or our jobs ? ’ the ‘ no ’ camp took a similarly catty approach , touring the country with an inflatable white elephant to illustrate their claim that the scheme is a waste of money			2
dismissive : @entity45 with the government due to make a decision on the route by the end of the year , the @entity7 ’s report chided : ‘ what should have been a serious and factually - based debate about how best to address the transport , economic and environmental challenges of @entity10 has too often been reduced to name - calling and caricature			1
‘ luddites , @entity4 and white elephants fought out a battle of “ jobs versus lawns ”			0
’ it continued : ‘ we urge the government to desist from disparaging opponents of @entity10 as @entity4 , and for both sides in the debate to show respect for each other and to focus on the facts			2
’ @entity10 would see 250mph trains able to carry 1,100 passengers running from @entity86 to @entity18 by 2026 , with further extensions ready by about 2032			1
the @entity7 chairman , @entity89 mp @entity88 , said the network ‘ would provide a step change in the capacity , quality , reliability and frequency of rail services between our major cities ’			0
but she also accepted that @entity10 could have ‘ a substantial negative impact on the countryside , communities and people along the route ’			2
the committee report backed the plan in principle and stated that a high - speed line ‘ offers potential economic and strategic benefits that a conventional line does not ’			2
these were said to include a ‘ dramatic shift ’ in connectivity between cities and access to @entity115 and continental @entity116 , as well as ‘ time savings and crowding benefits ’			0
it added that plans for @entity10 ‘ must be accompanied by complementary regional and local strategies for transport , housing , skills and employment ’			0
however , the committee members ultimately admitted that ‘ if a new line is to be built , it should be a high - speed line ’			0
‘ our judgment is that @entity10 could indeed be the catalyst for economic benefits , ’ they concluded .			1

@entity10 ' a catalyst for economic benefits ' says *mps*
they say there is a ' good case ' for expansion north or @entity18
