by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:16 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 8 august 2013 the @entity2 was last night accused of an ‘ immigration cover - up ’ after parts of a highly critical border security report were blacked out			1
a total of 15 passages were redacted from a study into border controls in @entity10 on the grounds that publishing them would be ‘ undesirable for reasons of national security ’			0
it is the first time that a regular report by the chief inspector of borders and immigration @entity19 has had significant sections withdrawn from public view by home secretary @entity23			2
@entity24 : the home secretary @entity23 has been accused of a cover up after parts of a critical report were blacked out among the details erased from the report is the number of illegal migrants sneaking into @entity32 on @entity34 trains from @entity35			1
the so - called ‘ @entity45 loophole ’ allows migrants to stay on the train through @entity38 without showing any documentation because they are in the @entity41 ’s free travel zone , and then arrive at @entity42 to claim asylum			1
other passages were blacked out in sections dealing with concerns over staff shortages at @entity32 ’s main immigration posts in @entity10			1
meanwhile , the unredacted parts of the report contained worrying signs of mounting pressures on border controls in @entity10 which check passengers using ferries to the @entity32			2
@entity58 immediately seized on the redactions			1
@entity58 ’s immigration spokesman @entity60 called on mrs may to share the report in full with the @entity63			1
he said : ‘ this cover - up and the failure at our borders provide yet more dents in this government ’s much - tarnished credibility			0
what possible reason can there be for redacting elements of a report by a highly respected independent inspector ? ‘ this is a cover - up to hide her [ mr may ’s ] own failings			2
’ accusations : @entity58 mp @entity60 called on mrs may to share the report in full @entity82 , chairman of the @entity83 , said : ‘ i am concerned that the home secretary has decided to redact part of the findings related to the “ @entity87 ” ... the committee has been assured in the past that the loophole would be closed			1
‘ the withholding of information prevents us from properly holding the @entity94 to account			0
’ @entity96 leader @entity95 said it was ‘ extremely concerning ’ that the report had been ‘ censored ’			2
one passage in the report states : ‘ it was clear from our focus groups and interviews that staff and managers felt that resources in @entity10 were stretched at times			1
’ the preceding four paragraphs and the subsequent two were redacted			0
on the @entity87 , mr @entity19 wrote : ‘ during our familiarisation visit in october 2012 , managers confirmed that this was still a cause for concern regarding the security of the border			0
’ the whole of the following paragraph was redacted , as were several others in the section , including one containing numbers of illegals suspected of abusing the route			0
such is the scale of the problem that mr @entity19 called on ministers to build immigration detention facilities at @entity42 in central @entity127			0
the report warned that the @entity32 was facing a surge in the number of illegal immigrants seeking to enter the country through the channel ports			1
but thousands of illegals are not having their fingerprints taken			0
no prints have been taken from migrants at @entity10 since january 2010 and none at @entity139 – where the @entity141 entrance is situated – since april 2011			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ in accordance with the @entity147 the home secretary , in consultation with the independent chief inspector , is required to redact any material which , if published , would be prejudicial to the interests of national security			0
‘ these take the form of visible redactions in the report laid before @entity155			2

hidden details include number of illegal immigrants arriving from @entity35 on @entity34 trains using ' @entity45 loophole '
concerns over staff shortages also blacked out by mrs may
@entity58 calls for report to be shared in full in front of *mps*
