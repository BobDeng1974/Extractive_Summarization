if you spot a commuter with @entity3 headphones on , you may want to avoid sitting near them if they have an @entity6			1
during tests , this handset was found to be the loudest among @entity3 's full range of iphones including the @entity11 through to last year 's @entity12			1
and , the eight - year - old @entity11 was able to reach a higher volume than the 2010 @entity14			1
the meter presents the maximum reading in a-weighted decibels , or @entity25			1
this reading is used to show the loudness of a sound , as perceived by the ear having a louder phone can be beneficial , especially when playing music or conducting a phone call on loudspeaker			0
but exposure to excessively loud noise - particularly when directed through headphones - can cause health problems , too			0
in environments where noise exceeds 85 @entity25 , for example , employees are required to wear ear protectors			2
and , as a comparison , average sound levels produced by a live band are around 110 dba			0
according to the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , exposure to these noise levels can disturb sleep , raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease			0
the latest sound test was carried out by @entity16 , and was a follow - up to a sound test the site filmed after the @entity57 was released in 2012			1
in the latest video , a decibel meter is placed beneath the speaker of each handset and music is played at full volume			2
the meter presents the maximum reading in a-weighted decibels , or @entity25			2
this reading is used to show the relative loudness of a sound in the air , as it 's perceived by the ear			0
@entity72 @entity73 : 98.6 dba @entity74 : 103.6 @entity45 @entity14 : 92.9 @entity45 @entity75 @entity57 : 104.0 @entity45 @entity76 @entity77 @entity6 6 : 105.4 @entity45 @entity78 using this method , low frequency sounds are reduced , compared to unweighted decibels , because the ear does n't hear lower frequencies as well as higher ones			1
a typical rating is around 25 @entity45 , which is 25 a-weighted decibels above the threshold of a person 's hearing , and is said to be relative to the loudness of a person whispering in a quiet room			2
the meter changes position below the different handsets because the speaker changes position on each model , explained @entity16			2
the @entity6 6 had the loudest speakers on test , with a reading of @entity101 , beating the larger plus by 0.4 dba			1
the @entity14 was the quietest , at @entity45 , which was worse than the original @entity11 , which had a reading of 94.3 @entity105			1
the @entity57 was in third place on 104 dba			0
the @entity74 and @entity108 had the same reading , at @entity110 , and the @entity111 registered a reading of 102 @entity45			1
the speakers on the @entity73 produced 98.6 @entity105			0
this is n't the first test in which the @entity14 performed worse than the original 2007 @entity11			1
the @entity6 6 ( left ) had the loudest speakers on test , with a reading of @entity101 , beating the larger plus by 0.4 dba			1
the @entity14 ( right ) was the quietest , at @entity45 , which was worse than the original @entity11 with 94.3 @entity45 in 2013 , fan site @entity118 created a video test of eight handsets , including the @entity11 up to the @entity108			1
each of the handsets were ' freshly restored and not jailbroken ' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand			0
in the first test , all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the @entity74 shut down fastest , followed by @entity128 , then the 4 , then the original model			0
according to the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , 40 per cent of @entity131 â€™s population is exposed to noise levels in excess of @entity134 - about the same level of a noisy office			0
the average washing machine has a recorded sound level of @entity140 , refrigerators average at around 50db refrigerator while in some instances food processors can reach up to @entity143			0
who says this amount of noise is enough to disturb sleep , raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease			0
according to a survey of 2,000 @entity154 adults by @entity155 , 39 per cent of people will avoid using technology appliances at certain times because of the noise they produce			0
meanwhile , almost a third of people find it difficult to drown out the noise and almost half consider sound an important factor in their purchasing decision when buying home appliances			0
the worst offending items in the home , on average , include : food mixer - 90db tumble dryer - 60db washing machine - @entity140 vacuum cleaner - @entity140 refrigerator - 50db the newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models , but took exactly the same amount of time as each other , to the second			0
each of the phones booted up at different times , but @entity118 highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and @entity183 and software between the newest and oldest phones , meaning this was not unexpected			2
this is n't the first test in which the @entity14 performed worse than the original 2007 @entity11			1
a video from @entity118 found the original retro model outperfomed more recent models in terms of performance			1
in tests , newer models booted up first , yet the original phone ( far right ) booted up faster than the @entity14 the newer models all booted up first , and at almost the same time , yet the original phone booted up faster than the @entity14			2
@entity3 's @entity73 was the slowest to boost			1
in the final tests , @entity118 launched the @entity199 , and @entity3 websites			1
the male voiceover explained that the @entity108 loads sites ' instantaneously ' adding : ' the extra processing power and the new @entity205 capabilities , its an amazing device '			0
when launching @entity199 , the @entity57 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go ' downhill ' from there			0
in conclusion , the video maker claimed : ' i learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on , but it 's marginally less noticeable the higher you go , so if you have a 5 i would n't really recommend upgrading to a @entity77 just based on the fact you want extra amount of power , because it has an amazing amount of power as it is			2
' in the final tests , @entity118 launched the @entity199 , and @entity3 websites , pictured			1
during the video , the voiceover explained the @entity108 loads sites ' instantaneously '			2
when launching @entity199 , the @entity57 beat the @entity111 but the rest of the handsets loaded the page slower than its successor			0

@entity16 placed decibel meters by the speakers of each of @entity3 's iphones
this included 10 handsets from the original @entity11 to last year 's @entity12
the @entity6 6 had the loudest speakers on test , with a reading of 104.5 @entity45
@entity14 was the quietest , at 92.9 @entity45 - this was worse than @entity11 's @entity25
@entity118 *previously* tested boot times on the @entity11 up to the @entity108
that video also revealed the @entity14 did n't perform as well as the @entity11
