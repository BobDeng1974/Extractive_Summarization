two unfinished sketches by @entity1 have been discovered on the reverse side of two watercolors after remaining unseen for almost one hundred years			1
officials at @entity7 's @entity6 museum says the collector who bought the paintings more than 90 years ago probably never knew the hidden sketches were there			1
the foundation said the sketches — one graphite and the other watercolor — were found during conservation work on the reverse sides of two @entity1 watercolors depicting the landscape of southern @entity20			1
two @entity1 drawings were found on the backs of his watercolors undergoing restoration at the @entity6 , including this graphite sketch of houses found on the back of his work trees chief conservator @entity31 ( left ) and consulting curator @entity32 ( right ) said that dr @entity33 did not know that he was buying the hidden drawings dr @entity35 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) for $ 100 each in 1921 from @entity38 officials said that the sketches have n't been seen since at least the early 20th century , ' most likely prior to dr. @entity42 's purchase of the works from @entity38 in 1921			1
' ' we 've had ( the watercolors ) out of the frame before			0
but the backs were covered with brown paper , ' said @entity31 , the foundation 's senior director of conservation and chief painting conservator , told the @entity52			1
' that 's one of the reasons they were sent ( for conservation )			0
@entity57 paper is very acidic , and they needed acid - free paper			0
' officials said @entity1 often worked on both sides of the paper in his sketchbooks and on larger sheets , producing thousands of such drawings over the course of his career , but they were usually done ' to experiment with line and color			2
' mr @entity33 bought the watercolors for $ 100 each , according to the @entity73			1
the additional small experiments by the artist , who influenced many 20th century luminaries such as @entity78 , may be worth a fortune			0
@entity1 's series @entity80 includes one of the most expensive paintings ever sold , a picture that the @entity85 royal family bought for $ 263million			1
@entity1 , ( seen left in 1906 , the year of his death and right in 1895 self - portrait ) influenced much of 20th century art and his works regularly sell for millions of dollars his watercolors have fetched up to $ 25million at auction , according to @entity94			2
ms @entity31 said the sketches , which were on the back of watercolors normally on view in one of the galleries , offer a window into @entity1 's artistic process			1
on the back of ' the @entity105 , ' conservators found that @entity1 had begun a sketch of trees with pencil and then color , but the center of the sketch is so unfinished it 's hard to determine what it represents			1
marks on the sketch include the word ' non ' , likely meaning that the work was not complete enough to be sold			0
on the back of ' trees , ' conservators found a detailed depiction without color of houses and the same @entity125 range that was often the subject of the artist 's sketches and paintings			2
' we had no reason to think there was anything there , ' said ms @entity31 , who said nothing was found on the back of another @entity1 watercolor after conservation work in 2007			2
@entity33 officials say 15 unknown @entity1 drawings have been found in the last three decades			2
the @entity6 , seen in its old building in 2003 , also owns one of @entity1 's @entity143 series , one of which sold for $ 263million to the @entity85 royal family @entity32 , a @entity145 assistant professor of art and art history and a former @entity33 curator , said @entity1 frequently walked along a route that looked out over the @entity125 mountains			1
the range ran near his home in @entity154 in the south of @entity20			0
' @entity1 walked frequently there and did many depictions of it , ' @entity32 said			0
both ms @entity32 and ms @entity31 said they believe that @entity42 was unaware that he had acquired , in ms @entity32 's words , ' four for the price of two			0
' the correspondence between mr @entity33 and mr @entity38 , the brother of @entity163 , contains no mention of the drawings , so the seller likely did not know about them either			0
the foundation plans to display the works in double - sided frames that will allow viewing of both sides from april 10 through may 18 , after which the watercolors will be returned to their original locations			0
the @entity6 was undergoing a multiyear restoration project for its work when the new sketches were discovered			0
