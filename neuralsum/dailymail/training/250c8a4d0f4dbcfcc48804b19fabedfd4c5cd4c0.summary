by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 1 may 2013 @entity1 has felt permanently airsick since flying to @entity2 in 2005 a mother - of - two has been battling a constant feeling of travel sickness since taking a flight eight years ago			1
@entity1 , 46 , was left struggling to balance , nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in @entity9 , @entity2 , in 2005			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , thought the feeling would pass but was horrified when her symptoms worsened throughout the holiday until she could no longer walk down the hotel corridor without holding onto the wall			1
even after arriving back in the @entity19 following the two week holiday with her daughters , @entity22 and @entity23 , now aged 18 and 13 , ms @entity1 ’s symptoms failed to subside			1
she was eventually diagnosed with @entity24 ( @entity24 ) and has suffered from incurable , and sometimes debilitating , attacks ever since			1
ms @entity1 said : ‘ i got on the plane and i was perfectly healthy , it was a perfectly normal flight			1
and then when the plane landed i stood up to get my bag and i felt a bit weird			0
‘ as soon as we landed and i stepped off the plane i felt seriously odd			0
the whole world had transformed into bouncy castle land and i felt as if i was walking on a giant marshmallow			0
‘ throughout the holiday that feeling never went away , it was like being on the @entity38 at the fairground my world was moving up and down and from side to side constantly			2
‘ i felt sick , had a headache and felt decidedly unwell			2
i presumed i had an ear infection and thought i would wait it out , go home , and see the doctor			0
’ however , when the family ’s flight home took off all of ms @entity1 ’s symptoms disappeared and she thought she was better			1
unfortunately , the respite was short lived and the symptoms returned as soon as she stepped off the plane			2
ms @entity1 said : ‘ and so started a terrible few months of doctor visits , travel sickness pills , ear syringing , lying on the floor crying , hanging onto the bed , throwing up , and nobody finding anything wrong with me			1
‘ i felt like my world was constantly moving , i felt nauseous all the time , i could n't sleep because when i lay still everything would keep moving up and down , back and forth			2
‘ after five to six weeks i was tired , i could n't sleep , i could n't read because the words would jump out of the page , and i could n't sit still because the more still i was , the worse it was			1
she was left struggling to balance , nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in @entity9 ‘ and then one day i woke up and it was gone			1
i was so relieved i thought i was cured , i really thought it was an imbalance in my ear and it had settled down			0
’ however , when ms @entity1 went to @entity2 with her daughters again the following year , her symptoms returned and this time they were worse			1
when she returned she was left unable to sleep , read or walk in a straight line			2
at one point she could not stand up and was left clinging to the carpet in her living room as her world spun around her			0
@entity75 from the @entity76 , said : ‘ @entity24 , or the " sickness of landing " , is a condition characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying , similar to those of being on a boat			1
‘ @entity24 is usually triggered by long - haul air and / or sea travel but there have been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion - based games and fun fair rides			1
‘ additional symptoms can include nausea , headaches , fatigue and sensitivity to light			2
‘ our research within the @entity98 at the @entity76 has shown that these symptoms can last for years and impact significantly on individuals ' lives , disrupting work , relational and recreational activities , which in turn can lead to depression and anxiety			2
‘ this is an invisible illness - the person may not look unwell			0
‘ it can be very difficult to gain a diagnosis as there is still much uncertainty surrounding @entity24 ; we do not know the cause of the illness at present and it is currently a very under - researched condition			2
‘ there is no ' cure ' for @entity24 at this time although interestingly , those with the condition often find symptoms temporarily diminish during motion , for instance car travel , which differentiates @entity24 from conditions concerning the inner ear			1
’ despite several visits to her gp , doctors were baffled by her condition			0
desperate for a diagnosis , ms @entity1 turned to the internet and came across @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
this is a neurological disorder triggered by travel , such as boat or plane journeys			0
the symptoms last long after the journey has finished			0
instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness , such as nausea , people with @entity24 feel as though they are rocking or bobbing constantly			1
this feeling can last for months , or even years , and the only time this feeling subsides is when they are in motion again			0
when ms @entity1 read about @entity24 on the internet , she took the information into her doctor who confirmed this was what she had			1
however , the doctor informed her that there is no cure and so she has been forced to live with the condition ever since			0
she said : ‘ when i got home from holiday i staggered to the doctors and i actually lay down on the floor in the doctors ’ surgery and gripped onto the carpet , i felt so ill. ‘ the doctor and another patient had to practically carry me into the surgery and onto the couch			0
i had to hold onto the wall because i was convinced i was going to fall off the couch			0
‘ none of the conventional vertigo tablets made any difference so i started to research and found @entity24 online			1
i knew instantly this was what i had , i showed the research to my doctor and he confirmed it			0
ms has now had the symptoms every day for the last four years			0
she no longer drinks alcohol as it is difficult enough to maintain her balance without a drink , she can not dance and she finds it difficult to read			2
she also can not sit still for longer than an hour at a time			0
but despite her condition , ms @entity1 leads a normal life - she has two jobs as a school caretaker and a play leader , continues to go on holiday every year , and does everything she can to prevent the condition ruining her life			2
she felt unwell throughout the holiday but assumed that she had an ear infection and decided just to visit a doctor when she got home she said : ‘ i 've never had it as bad as the first two episodes but i 've now had it constantly for almost four years			0
‘ i take precautions to avoid my symptoms worsening			0
i do n't drink , i eat well , i exercise a lot , i avoid any kind of boat journey , if i fly i walk on the plane and i try not to sit still for too long			2
‘ at the moment i live in a wibbly wobbly world , if i stand still or sit down i can see the world swaying slightly			0
it makes it hard to read or watch tv and i have a constant headache and feel sick			1
‘ if i 'm tired or i 've been on a long journey , i am worse but it 's usually at its worst when i 'm still			0
‘ walking on a treadmill is really hard , i fall over , standing still with my eyes shut is impossible , i find myself falling backwards , almost like i 'm being pushed			0
‘ dancing is almost impossible , anything where i have to be spun around or do a quick turn is a big no no. the symptoms did not improve on her return to the @entity19 and she was eventually diagnosed with @entity24 ‘ in between work i go to the gym for up to two hours a day , and walk my dog five times a day , anything to keep me moving			1
‘ there is no cure , there 's no medical information , no treatment , there 's nothing that 's going to make it better - i just have to live with it			0
‘ i lead a very full , happy , if slightly topsy turvey life			0
’ @entity75 from the @entity76 , who is conducting research into the condition , said : ‘ @entity24 , or the " sickness of landing " , is a condition characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying , similar to those of being on a boat			1
‘ @entity24 is usually triggered by long - haul air and / or sea travel but there have been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion - based games and fun fair rides			1
‘ additional symptoms can include nausea , headaches , fatigue and sensitivity to light			2
the cause of the condition is not known and there is no cure so ms @entity1 has had to learn to live with it ‘ our research within the @entity98 at the @entity76 has shown that these symptoms can last for years and impact significantly on individuals ' lives , disrupting work , relational and recreational activities , which in turn can lead to depression and anxiety			1
‘ this is an invisible illness , the person may not look unwell , and we have found that there is the additional problem of stigma and lack of social support			0
