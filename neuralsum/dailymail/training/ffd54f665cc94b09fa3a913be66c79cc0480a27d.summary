meditating can make you warmer , researchers studying ancient @entity2 techniques have found			2
scientists in @entity5 say the discovery means core body temperature can be controlled by the brain - and could have major implications for people working in extreme environmentsd the researchers have discovered that core body temperature can be increased by using certain meditation techniques			1
they believe that meditation could , therefore , also be used to help people to function in very cold environments			1
@entity2 nuns are able to use meditation techniques to increase their core body temperature the team of researchers at the @entity20 showed for the first time that g - tummo meditation has been used by @entity2 nuns to increase their core body temperature			1
previous research has only shown that g - tummo meditators are able to increase the peripheral body temperature in their fingers and toes			1
the researchers , who published their findings in the journal @entity29 , collected data during a unique ceremony in @entity32 in which nuns raised their core body temperature and dried wet sheets which were wrapped around their bodies in -25 degree @entity37 temperatures			2
using electroencephalography ( @entity40 ) recordings and temperature measures , the team observed increases in core body temperature up to 38.3 degree celsius - normal body temperature is 37 degrees @entity37			2
a second study was then conducted with @entity49 participants who used a breathing technique of the g - tummo meditative practice and they were also able to increase their core body temperature , within limits			1
the findings from this study showed that specific aspects of the meditation techniques can be used by non-meditators to regulate their body temperature through breathing and mental imagery			1
@entity61 is a form of yoga found in @entity2 teachings			0
its purpose is to gain control over the body 's processes			0
it uses a system of visualisations and breathing techniques including ' vase breathing '			0
vase breathing involves breathing into the abdomen and then not releasing all of the air from the belly before taking another breath			0
this form of yoga is most commonly found in the @entity82			0
it can enable people to increase the temperature of their extremities and can also be used to change metabolism rates			0
this could allow them to adapt to , and function in , cold environments and could reduce performance problems associated with decreased body temperature			2
the two aspects of g - tummo meditation that lead to temperature increases are ‘ vase breath ’ and concentrative visualisation			1
‘ @entity102 breath ’ is a specific breathing technique which causes thermogenesis , which is a process of heat production			0
the other technique , concentrative visualisation , involves focusing on a mental image of flames along the spinal cord in order to prevent heat losses			0
both techniques work in conjunction leading to elevated temperatures up to the level of moderate fever			0
associate professor @entity114 from the @entity115 at the @entity20 , said : ‘ practicing “ vase breathing ” alone is a safe technique to regulate core body temperature in a normal range			2
a second study using @entity49 participants showed that they were also able to increase their core body temperature using breathing and mental imagery ‘ the participants whom i taught this technique to were able to elevate their body temperature , within limits , and reported feeling more energised and focused			1
‘ with further research , @entity131 meditators could use “ vase breathing ” to improve their health and regulate cognitive performance			0
’ monasteries maintaining g - tummo traditions are very rare and are mostly located in the remote areas of eastern @entity32 .			1

@entity2 nuns increase their body temperatures using g - tummo meditation
use breathing and mental imagery to increase it to more than 38 degrees
the technique could be used by people trying to function in very cold places
