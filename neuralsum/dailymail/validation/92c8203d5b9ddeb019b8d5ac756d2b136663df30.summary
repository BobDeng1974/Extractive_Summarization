@entity0 has praised @entity1 for taking the @entity3 fight to @entity4 , although feels @entity5 may have ' lucked ' into the team 's latest resurgence			1
after a run of eight straight @entity4 victories stretching back into what proved to be a crushing 2014 campaign , @entity1 and @entity5 proved there may be a battle ahead this term with a win in @entity16 on sunday			1
it was @entity1 's first triumph for almost two years and has given the championship scrap this season a shot in the arm after @entity4 ' romp in the opening race in @entity24 which suggested another dominant run was looming			1
@entity5 waves the @entity1 flag in parc ferme after winning sunday 's @entity16 @entity29 the four - time world champion clenches his fists are claiming the first victory of his @entity1 career assessing @entity1 's success , @entity34 star @entity0 said : ' i am really happy to see @entity1 win			1
i thought @entity4 were going to trounce it this year , so it is great for the sport and for other teams to see another take it to @entity4			2
' it is not as if the weather was funny or safety cars destroyed their race , @entity5 was just quicker			0
i was very impressed by him			0
' he did a great job which shows things can turn around over a winter , which is good to see for every team			0
it 's nice to see someone challenge them			0
' but despite how well @entity5 drove , @entity0 feels there has to be an element of good fortune he was back on the top step after leaving @entity59 at the end of last season for @entity1			1
the @entity1 pit - wall salute @entity5 as he crosses the line to win the second round of the championship @entity0 is pictured speaking to @entity59 driver @entity66 ahead of sunday 's race in @entity16 @entity0 has intimated it is unlikely new @entity34 team - mate @entity69 would have left @entity1 if he had known the team would be winning again just two races into 2015			1
' he has definitely lucked into a situation , i would say , ' added @entity0			2
' i am sure he had the same information as @entity69 when @entity69 left the team			2
' it is one of those situations which sometimes works out for you , for example ( @entity80 ) @entity79 was overtaken by his new team - mate ( @entity66 ) , and lapped by his ex-team - mate ( @entity5 ) on the same lap. ' who would have thought that at the end of last year , so sometimes you do luck into a situation			1
' it would appear @entity34 need luck and a whole lot more besides to make them competitive any time soon as both @entity0 and @entity69 retired with technical issues			2
it was the first time neither @entity34 had been classified since the @entity96			0
' we have a lot of work to do before we can think about winning , ' said @entity0			0
' i do n't think we will be even fighting for points when we go to the next race in @entity104 , maybe @entity100 if we make a small step before then			0
' but it is probably going to be @entity107 we start fighting for points , and that would be a massive step			0

@entity0 admitted he was ' happy ' to see @entity1 beat @entity4
but the @entity114 star reckons @entity5 has ' lucked into a situation '
@entity34 have endured *difficult* start to the season and neither @entity0 nor his team - mate @entity69 finished sunday 's @entity16 @entity29
