his penchant for topless scything has proved a hit with housewives around the @entity5 - and sent many rushing to social media to declare their love for actor @entity8 , 31			1
but it seems not everyone is a fan of the gardening techniques featured on @entity12 - not least the mowing community who have complained about @entity8 's ' excessive sweating and grunting ' and say it should never be done shirtless			1
@entity8 set hearts aflutter when he stripped off to manfully mow a hay field with a scythe , an ancient cutting tool used for centuries prior to horse drawn and modern mowing machinery			2
they say @entity8 ’s macho grunts and terrible technique as he hacked at the hay tarnished the view of the usually ' sedate ' action of scything			1
expert scyther @entity25 , 56 , says in real life , @entity8 would have run out of breath long before completing the filed - and he would have kept his shirt on to protect him from the sun. ' when the @entity49 episode in question aired , word got around our network of scythe enthusiasts very quickly that there had been this scene in it where @entity8 used a scythe , ' he says			1
' it was accompanied by a lot of comments saying his technique was n’t very good			0
the story of @entity12 highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we were n’t very impressed with @entity8 ’s scything			1
. that 's how it 's done : mr @entity25 demonstrates how scything should really be done surely not ? mr @entity25 brushed off comparisons with @entity12 and compared himself to @entity24 instead that 's more like it : @entity8 's shirtless @entity49 has been setting hearts aflutter on sunday nights ' there was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you ’d mow like that would be in a competition			1
' mr @entity25 , from @entity82 in @entity83 , also questioned whether @entity8 had been shown how to use a scythe properly before the cameras rolled			1
' @entity86 is an efficient and poetic way of cutting rather than the way it was portrayed on @entity49 where it was this very aggressive , manly action			0
' using a scythe should be a sedate , pleasurable activity rather than an arduous , backbreaking chore			0
it can be zen - like if you ’ve got a sharp blade and good technique			2
' that was how the programme makers wanted to portray it but it was clear to us that there was n’t much effective work being done			0
' the grass and flowers in the meadow were n’t flying everywhere , which you might expect if someone was good with a scythe			0
' i would guess that @entity113 had not been shown how to use a scythe properly before filming			0
if an experienced scyther were to put the same amount of energy into it as on @entity49 they ’d be getting an awful lot done			0
' a work rate like that is also not conducive to keeping the action up all day , but that was obviously in conflict with how producers wanted the scene to look			0
' mr @entity25 also raised questions about @entity8 ’s lack of shirt , claiming a real scyther would keep their clothes on to protect them from the elements			1
exhausting : mr @entity25 says @entity12 puts too much effort into his scything and would n't finish the job smooth move : fellow expert @entity138 , from @entity83 , shows off his skills in a @entity141 meadow the 56 - year - old , who runs courses in how to wield a scythe , added : ' the fact that he had no top on was not particularly realistic - if you were in the field all day and wanted to protect yourself from the sun you would n’t take your shirt off			1
' there are times when it is ok to scythe topless , like if you are in competition , but i ’m more @entity24 than @entity113			1
' meanwhile ... female fans take to @entity157 to complain about the lack of shirtless mowing in last night 's episode of @entity49 female fans of @entity164 's @entity163 period drama @entity49 are complaining after dashing actor @entity8 kept his shirt on in last night 's penultimate episode			1
many have taken to @entity157 to voice their upset after the @entity171 hunk , who plays captain @entity12 , went a whole episode without revealing his chest			1
in previous episodes the star has been seen scything topless and skinny dipping in the @entity163 sea			0
where are the abs ? fans were disappointed by the lack of topless action in last night 's @entity49 recap : @entity12 has appeared topless in nearly every episode and is seen here in episode three memorable : episode two featured @entity8 taking a naked swim in crystal clear @entity163 waters last night the @entity164 continuity announcer said there would be ' distressing scenes ' as one of the characters is murdered , but many women joked it was ' distressing ' seeing @entity8 fully clothed			1
one fan named @entity200 tweeted : ' distressing scenes my arse			0
only ' cos he kept his clothes on all night # @entity12			2
' @entity205 added : ' despite the @ @entity207 before # @entity49 my wife is traumatised by some of the scenes in which @entity113 kept his shirt on			2
' @entity212 posted : ' all bad news on the # @entity49 front tonight			0
@ @entity8 did n't get his shirt off once			2
' others complained about the lack of any obvious carer for @entity12 and @entity219 's baby @entity218 because she was absent from most of the scenes			1
although @entity12 sacks his servants @entity221 and @entity223 , @entity219 is later seen visiting @entity224 and going for cliff top walks without her baby daughter			0
' can someone tell me who looks after # @entity12 's baby @ @entity207 , ' tweeted @entity231			2
cross : a viewer complained that the real source of distress was a lack of shirtlessness traumatic : viewers had been hoping that @entity12 would take his top off - but had no such luck compensation : one concluded that at least @entity12 's trademark smoulder had been left in place denouement : next week 's finale will reveal whether @entity248 and @entity224 manage to patch up their quarrel fired : other viewers questioned who was doing the childcare following @entity221 and @entity223 's sacking @entity255 tweeted : ' it 's all very good swooning over @entity248 , but we have some serious concerns for the welfare of @entity218 ! # homealone			1
' others joined a growing chorus of fans who want the series to continue beyond the final episode which airs next sunday			2
@entity266 tweeted : ' have a feeling there 's be lots of tears shed next sunday eve , approx 10pm			0
' @entity271 added : ' i genuinely do n't know what i 'm going to do after nxt wk			0
first # fortitude ends , now # @entity12			0
' @entity276 wrote : ' ca n't believe # @entity12 is near the end its been the highlight of my weekends ! ! ! ! ' @entity280 posted : ' ca n't believe it 's the last # @entity12 next week			2
how am i going to survive without seeing @ @entity282 every sunday ? ' another , @entity284 , tweeted : ' last episode of # @entity49 next week			0
i like my weekly @entity8 fix			0
' luckily for fans of the 18th century mining drama and mr @entity8 , the @entity164 announced last week that it has commissioned a second series of @entity49 .			1

@entity25 , 56 , from @entity83 , says @entity8 has the technique all wrong
mr @entity25 , who says his look is more @entity24 , says being topless is a no - no
meanwhile fans have complained about lack of shirtless scenes last night
@entity12 kept his shirt on for the whole of sunday night 's episode
disappointed fans complained about the *oversight* on @entity157
