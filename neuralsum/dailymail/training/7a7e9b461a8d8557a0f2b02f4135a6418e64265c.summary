@entity7 can ill afford to let anyone go just now with a mounting injury crisis but the 28 - year - old @entity5 is eager to play more games with a place in @entity14 's @entity13 squad at stake			2
his experience should be enough to ensure selection by @entity18 but @entity5 is also conscious of being sharp enough to perform at his best for his country in @entity20 where @entity14 are among the dark horses for a semi final place			2
on the move ? out - of - favour @entity6 defender @entity5 ( left ) is a target for @entity25 club @entity3 he is settled in @entity26 but 11 games in all competitions this season is not enough			1

sliding in : @entity5 , who is keen to cement his place in @entity14 's @entity13 squad , has struggled for playing time at @entity6 this season @entity50 happy to wait for @entity51 and @entity52 as @entity53 looks @entity54 may have a clearer run than they anticipated in their pursuit of @entity58 defender @entity51 this summer			1
@entity59 manager @entity53 has long been linked with the 22 - year - old but it is understood has now cooled his interest			1
wanted man : @entity64 will make another move for @entity58 defender @entity51 ( right ) this summer @entity53 has watched the @entity66 personally and is still looking around in the hope he or his scouts spot something better to replace @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity64 's main competition may now come from @entity73 and @entity74			0
@entity53 also had the opportunity to sign @entity58 midfielder @entity52 , who again is expected to move to @entity64 on a free in the summer , but declined			1
@entity77 hoping wanted man @entity76 stays put @entity79 manager @entity77 will be hoping the club resists offers for @entity76 on monday			1
the @entity83 striker is the subject of offers from @entity86 and @entity87 with the @entity89 window due to close at 5pm			0
time is against them but an £ 8million offer will make life even more difficult for @entity77 as he tries to lift his club following @entity96 's sale and saturday 's derby defeat			1
even surviving today may not put an end to the interest as @entity25 clubs are also keen on @entity76			1
they have until the end of this month before their window closes			0
opposite ways : @entity79 boss @entity77 ( left ) is hoping to keep hold of striker @entity76 ( right ) @entity108 eye wing wizards @entity106 and @entity109 the windows of opportunity remain open in @entity112 and @entity113			1

@entity108 showed some late interest in @entity125 's attacking midfielder @entity106 last week			1
a return to @entity66 for @entity127 was mooted as part of the deal but @entity108 chairman @entity130 is keen to see how @entity127 develops hence his resistance to @entity34 's efforts to sign him - plus the obvious factor that he did not want to sell for a loss so soon after purchasing			1
ongoing @entity135 and @entity79 target @entity106 has not been too consistent of late and his performance against @entity74 recently drew criticism from @entity139 as reported by @entity140			1

the 17 - year - old signed professional forms at @entity201 last month and is progressing nicely having broken into the first team this season			0
@entity147 and @entity64 are not alone in the big clubs to have taken an interest but their financial clout may persuade cash - strapped @entity198 to sell should they follow up with an offer			2
