click here to read @entity2 's match report again it was all about the team sheet			1
another @entity5 night for @entity6 , more intense scrutiny on the names @entity9 unveiled before kick - off			1
in @entity11 three weeks ago , @entity9 caused a hullabaloo when making wholesale changes to his starting line - up , drawing criticism for appearing to run up the white flag before their collision with the defending champions			1
this time , though , his selection was far more significant			1
on a freezing cold night in @entity21 , @entity9 decided that @entity6 needed to be solid , they needed experience and composure – and he sent out a team containing just two of the signings he made this summer			1
summer signings @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity27 started the match on the bench @entity34 , who joined @entity6 in the summer , scored his second @entity6 goal against @entity36 @entity30 became @entity6 's most expensive defender when he sealed a £ 20million move to @entity39 @entity9 does not duck away from making big calls but on night when he was under intense pressure this was revealing			1
he spent more than £ 110million on nine acquisitions but only @entity34 ( £ 4million from @entity45 ) and @entity46 ( loan from @entity11 ) made the cut			1
both of those , it must be noted , performed with credit			2
@entity34 got a goal – his second in as many matches – at a crucial stage and led the line purposefully , while @entity46 defended stoically ; he did all that was asked of him , standing tall , keeping possession and firing into tackles			1
but there was no @entity62 , the young left back who came from @entity65			2
he was consigned to the bench along with @entity30 ( the most expensive defender in @entity6 ’s history ) , @entity29 and @entity27			1
in effect , £ 67million wrapped up in blankets to repel the cold			2
@entity72 was nowhere to be seen			2
he cost £ 20million but has been so underwhelming that he is yet to provide a goal or an assist			1
@entity75 , meanwhile , was back at home , resting his injured groin			2
neither of them were missed			2
that should n’t be the case			2
@entity9 pointed out in march , when discussing @entity82 , that when a clubs spend huge sums of money they ' should expect to be challenging for the league ' ; it could be argued , then , that spending huge sums of money should at the very least improve a team			2
@entity6 playmaker @entity72 has failed to impress since joining from @entity92 outfit @entity91 @entity75 is yet to score a @entity94 goal for @entity6 since returning to @entity95 it is why this team sheet was far more enlightening than the one that was produced in @entity100			1
this , in not so many words , was @entity9 saying he could not trust those expensively assembled recruits to do a job when it was most required			1
‘ we needed the squad rebuilt , ’ @entity9 explained last month			2
‘ that decision was made ( knowing ) players might struggle a bit initially but in the future they would be big players for the club			2
that is where we are at			0
are we playing as fluent as we were last season ? no. ' but is there big potential in the team ? i believe there is			0
it may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season			0
as i said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent			0
’ any team would have been hurt by the sale of @entity131 but it said everything here that @entity9 needed to summon players who have been sparingly used			0
the @entity137 midfielder faces an uncertain future and has been linked with moves away but he came in and was stoic			0
there was nothing flash or fancy about what he did but he won tackles and cajoled his team - mates , scuffling for possession when it ended up at the feet of those in green			0
@entity135 , who was courted by @entity151 in august , does n’t do a glamorous job but he does it selflessly and it allows other to thrive			0
@entity9 decided to leave the majority of his summer recruits in the cold against @entity36 @entity135 ( right ) made his first @entity6 appearance since his side 's match against @entity160 @entity161 , for one , looked more comfortable with @entity135 in behind him			1
the 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation also brought out flashes of the best from @entity165 , who motored forward to score the games decisive goal , and the outstanding @entity168			1
@entity169 , another who could have left during the transfer window with @entity173 clubs interested , had some erratic moments but he performed far better than @entity30 has done , sticking his head out time and again to preserve @entity6 ’s lead			1
the added spin - off of @entity169 ’s performance was @entity179 playing with considerably more composure			0
@entity9 can not leave the @entity181 out against @entity182 on saturday as was the case when he failed to retain his place after excelling against @entity11 ; he has done more in his last two performances than @entity30 has managed since he arrived from @entity45			1
‘ you just have to be patient with him , ’ @entity9 argued after @entity30 had scored a winning goal against @entity187 in the @entity188			1
‘ he ’ll be a top centre - half for this club			0
he is a big talent			0
once he has this year and finds the levels of working here , he will do very , very well			0
the problem is that players are judged so early now			0
’ that may be so but they are judged for a reason			0
when they come at a premium price , the demand for them to start producing is instant and none of @entity6 ’s big buys have shown they are capable of making an impact yet			1
had they been able to , @entity9 would have included them			0
he did not spend all that money with the support of @entity212 to put together an expensive bench			0
he brought them to make a difference when in the games that truly matter			0
in spending the night watching the action unfold in front of them , we can safely say @entity9 does not believe they are ready			0
so the question remains : will they ever ?			0
