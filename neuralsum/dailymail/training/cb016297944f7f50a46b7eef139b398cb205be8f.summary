by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 11:14 est , 29 august 2012 actor @entity1 was at the eye of a storm of his own creation after he took to @entity5 to claim it was ' unfair ' that @entity7 missed the @entity9 convention and hit the gulf coast of the @entity11 the 62 - year - old star of @entity13 and @entity14 waded into the politically charged atmosphere that surrounds the battering of the coast by the category 1 hurricane and specifically @entity19 , or @entity19			1
' unfair s * * t : @entity21 spared by @entity7 ! @entity19 prolly f * * * ed again ! not understanding @entity23 's plan ! ' wrote @entity1 , seemingly agitated that seven - years on from the devastation of @entity25 , @entity19 and not the @entity26 in @entity27 took the full brunt of @entity7 's force			1
@entity1 in @entity30 in july 2012 : the actor has caused offence online by bemoaning the fact that @entity7 avoided the @entity26 and hit @entity19 instead the response to @entity1 's tweet was vitriolic , with conservative feather 's well and truly ruffled by the outspoken and popular actor			1

# killyourself ' wrote @ @entity45 , invoking one of @entity1 's most famous scenes from the film @entity48			0
other 's took their offence further , with @entity54 host @entity52 attacking @entity1 on @entity5 , saying , ' very few in my profession to respect these days			0
@entity1 is a sick , twisted , hateful racist ... ' however , support for @entity1 's controversial point of view is forthcoming on @entity5 , with 1,149 people re-tweeting his ' unfair ' tweet that @entity7 , when it was a tropical storm , missed the @entity26 in @entity27 on monday			1
@entity1 's tweets show how he initially claims it to be unfair that @entity7 has hit @entity19 but backtracks as he is attacked by conservatives online the majority of comments aimed at @entity1 though took exception to him apparently wishing ill - will on an entire city because of a political event being held there			1
half an hour later @entity1 realised that he might have crossed a line after thousands complained about what he wrote			0
just one of the thousands of vitriolic tweets that @entity1 received in response to his ' unfair ' tweet			0
this comment on @entity5 mirrors @entity1 's famous line in the film @entity48 ' @entity78 ! poked a @entity80 nest , hunh ? apologies to @entity23 , @entity27 , @entity21 & @entity7 ( sp ) ! who played the race card ? ! ' wrote @entity1			2
despite his back - track , it seems that his repeated mentions of @entity23 and @entity27 sparked more ire from @entity5 users			2
' whoooo ! a lotta s * * t stirred into a @entity92 * * t tweet ! @entity93 get @entity94 heated ! ' remarked @entity1 as he got creative with his favourite expletive			0

be safe & be @entity102 wherever you are & whatever your politics ! ' @entity104 in may of 2012 in @entity105 : the actress re-tweeted a post which seemed to indicated she would be happy for @entity9 's to drown during @entity7 @entity1 's support for president @entity109 is no secret , with the veteran @entity112 actor declaring in the march issue of @entity114 that he voted for mr. @entity109 ' because he was black			1
' ' @entity115 that 's why other folks vote for other people - because they look like them , ' said @entity1 to the magazine			0
and in october , @entity1 expressed his view that the @entity121 was racist by saying , ' it 's not politics			0
it all boils down pretty much to race			0
it is a shame , ' said @entity1 to @entity129			0
@entity1 's comments follow on from the actress @entity104 , who said she hoped @entity9 would be drowned by @entity7			1
the violent storm , which made landfall in @entity134 on tuesday night , was previously feared to be heading for the @entity21 convention in @entity27 , @entity136			2
and sitcom star @entity104 caused controversy when she appeared to endorse a tweet saying that the delegates should be swept ' right into the ocean '			1
on monday afternoon , ms @entity104 retweeted a message sent to her by another user saying : ' c'mon # @entity7 ! wash every pro-life , anti-education , anti-woman , xenophobic , gay - bashing , racist @entity146 right into the ocean ! # @entity26 ' then - @entity7 on 28 aug it was moving northwest through the @entity148			1
@entity7 's large reach is seen by its eastern cloud cover over the @entity148			2
