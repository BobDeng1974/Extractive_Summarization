police officers in the @entity1 have hit back at outraged protesters furious at the death of @entity4 , a black man who died in a police chokehold , saying he brought it upon himself			1
@entity9 officials and police supporters have seized on findings showing that @entity4 's asthma and obesity contributed to his death , and say they feel ' thrown under the bus ' by demonstrations and politicians			1
they also said that more people should have been pointing out that @entity4 was wrong to resist arrest when confronted by officers in @entity22 , @entity23 , this july			1
killing : @entity4 was killed by an @entity1 officer grabbing him round the neck			1
officers have pointed out that @entity4 's size and health issues contributed he was wrestled to the ground and repeatedly told officers ' i ca n't breathe ' as white patrolman @entity32 held him round the neck			1
he died in the wake of the confrontation - over the illegal sale of loose cigarettes - but a grand jury this week decided there would be no indictment over this death			0
the verdict , following close behind the decision not to charge officer @entity44 for shooting dead @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , prompted waves of ongoing protests - which have left officers sore			2
mayor @entity51 also weighed in , saying the case underscores the @entity1 's need to improve relations with minorities			2
policemen say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street			0
' police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus , ' said @entity66 , president of the police union			1
outraged : police officers say they feel badly treated by widespread protests sparked by the case but @entity66 said : ' what we did not hear is this : you can not go out and break the law			1
what we did not hear is that you can not resist arrest			0
' at the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days , protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case			0
signs read : ' @entity1 : blood on your hands , ' ' racism kills ' and ' hey officers , choke me or shoot me			2
' some demonstrators shouted , ' @entity1 pigs ! ' more than 280 people have been arrested , and more demonstrations were planned friday			2
in private and on internet chat rooms , officers have said they feel demoralized , misunderstood and ' all alone '			0
some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of @entity4 's , in defiance of the @entity1 's campaign of cracking down on minor ' quality of life ' offenses as a way to discourage serious crime			1
' everyone is just demonizing the police , ' said @entity112 , a professor of police studies at @entity114			0
' but police follow orders and laws			0
nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality - of - life enforcement is necessary			0
' marches : people have called for police reform on the back of the @entity4 case			1
union bosses say the message should be not to resist arrest the fatal encounter occurred in july after @entity132 and other police officers responded to complaints about @entity4 , a heavyset 43 - year - old father of six			1
the video showed @entity4 telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed			2
@entity132 , an eight - year veteran , appeared to wrap his arm around @entity4 's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers			1
@entity4 could be heard saying , ' i ca n't breathe , ' several times before he went motionless			2
the medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in @entity4 's death , but also that asthma , obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors			1
while many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer , no evidence has come to light to suggest that @entity132 's actions were racially motivated			0
his supervising sergeant at the scene was black , and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation			0
as the video sparked accusations of excessive force , the police unions mounted a counter-narrative : that @entity4 would still be alive if he had obeyed orders , that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that @entity132 had used an authorized takedown move - more like a headlock than a chokehold - to subdue him			1
while the grand jury proceedings were secret , @entity32 's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke @entity179 and did not believe the man was in mortal danger			0
@entity132 's defenders have included rep. @entity183 , @entity184 , who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if @entity4 had been white , and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he could n't breathe			2
' the fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe , ' said @entity183 , the son of a police officer			0
' and if you 've ever seen anyone locked up , anyone resisting arrest , they 're always saying , ` you 're breaking my arm , you 're killing me , you 're breaking my neck			0
' so if the cops had eased up or let him go at that stage , the whole struggle would have started in again			0
