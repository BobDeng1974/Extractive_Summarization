grappling in the box is just like diving — it drives everybody mad			2
the important thing now is that if referees are going to clamp down on it , it has to be the same for everybody			0
it has been funny to see @entity9 almost position themselves as victims			1
yes , @entity11 and @entity12 were put in a couple of headlocks at @entity15			0
but are those two innocent of grabbing people in the area ? do me a favour			1
every team in the league does it because they know they can get away with it			0
it ’s the same with any part of the game — diving to win a free - kick , illegally stopping an opponent — if you do n’t get punished , you ’ll keep doing it			1
@entity11 grabs @entity32 while the @entity33 holds @entity35 's shirt and the @entity36 gives some back @entity11 is bundled to the floor by @entity39 ( right ) as @entity40 wrestles with @entity12 ( centre ) join @entity46 's @entity43 campaign by parading the logo at matches ... you could also win an @entity48 shirt signed by @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 by tweeting your support but i ’ve always said if a player dives one week and is banned for three games , there ’s no way he ’ll do it next time			1
it ’s the same with grappling			2
if penalties are given and cards are shown , it will start to disappear			0
i have sympathy for the referees because there is so much pushing and shoving going on — they ca n’t keep their eyes on everyone			0
it works both ways , too , with strikers fouling defenders just as much as the other way around			0
in my playing days i covered the space at the near post for a corner , but if i felt i could stop an opponent with a grapple i would , because i knew the referee would n’t punish me			0
my @entity46 colleague @entity51 , who helped launch this campaign , was a great defender but i seem to remember even he grabbed me around the neck a few times ! if i was a manager that ’s how i would want my players to defend			1
not because it ’s right , but because teams have got away with it for years			2
it ’s time something was done			2
there ’s no doubt @entity91 is a serial offender			1
but he ’s not alone			2
@entity91 is one of a group who stand watching the man rather than the ball — it ’s not proper defending and it has to stop			1
referees are going to be under scrutiny now at every free - kick or corner			0
i just hope they are strong enough and consistent enough to start acting			0
@entity12 wrestles with @entity40 ( left ) while @entity11 grapples @entity32 ( right ) during sunday 's game @entity102 's @entity91 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity106 's @entity105 last week			1

@entity9 are *n't* innocent of grabbing people in the penalty area
every club does it , because they know they can get away with it
there ’s no doubt @entity91 is a serial offender , but he ’s not alone
