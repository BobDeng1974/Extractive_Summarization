after more than a week of speculation , @entity0 has finally admitted its ' dear leader ' is poorly - sparking new rumours he may have gout			1
@entity7 , whose weight has ballooned in recent months thanks in part to an addiction to @entity13 cheese , has been struck down by a mystery illness , his henchmen in @entity6 revealed today , saying only that he was ' suffering from discomfort '			1
it comes after the 31 - year - old vanished from his usual role as centrepiece to the isolated country 's propaganda machine after last appearing in public at a concert with his wife on september 3 , fuelling speculation he is suffering from bad health			1
he had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in july and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on thursday appeared to have difficulty walking			2
he has also been seen walking with a limp ' the wealth and prosperity of our socialism is thanks to the painstaking efforts of our marshal , who keeps lighting the path for the people , like the flicker of a flame , despite suffering discomfort , ' a voice over for the hour - long documentary said			1
the documentary was followed by a pre-recorded broadcast of a @entity57 meeting from which @entity7 was notably absent			2
@entity7 has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , photos released by state media show			1
@entity0 observers speculate @entity7 's weight and family background may have contributed to his condition			2
now and then : @entity7 has rapidly gained weight since coming to power ( right ) after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , photos released by state media show ' @entity73 ' : historically known as ' the disease of kings ' , with @entity77 a known sufferer , gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle ' based on his gait , it appears he has gout - something ( due to ) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the @entity7 family , ' said @entity91 , an expert on the @entity0 leadership and contributor to the 38 @entity57 website			1
historically known as ' the disease of kings ' , with @entity77 a known sufferer , gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle			2
the condition used to be rare among young people , but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people			2
men are more likely to develop gout than women because their uric acid levels rise during puberty and remain higher than women through adulthood			0
it usually first appears between the ages of 30 to 60 and becomes more common with age			0
the condition is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain , redness and swelling in the joints such as the big toe			0
gout is caused by a build - up of uric acid in the blood			2
uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down chemicals in the cells known as purines			0
if you produce too much uric acid or excrete too little when you urinate , the uric acid will build up and may cause needle - like crystals in and around the joints , most commonly in the foot ( particularly the big toe ) , but also the knees , fingers , forearms and elbows			0
the crystals may spill over from the joint cartilage into the joint space , causing a painful attack			0
@entity144 naturally high in purines include red meat – such as beef , lamb and pork - seafood , especially shellfish and oily fish , and offal			0
' it is protein - rich foods that cause gout , ' dietitian @entity153 told @entity158			2
' cheese is not a high risk food , although eating a lot of it will mean he is likely to have high calcium – and cholesterol – levels			0
' other risk factors include obesity - partly because of extra pressure on the joints and chemical changes as a result of the fat - and heavy alcohol consumption , particularly beer , which is high in purines , and spirits			0
smoking is not generally seen as a risk factor for gout			0
the 31 - year - old @entity0 leader got a taste for @entity13 cheese while a student in @entity13 - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities , despite @entity187 sanctions			1
a unhealthy appetite for @entity189 , also known as @entity13 cheese , is believed to be a key factor in @entity7 's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp			1
experts believe @entity7 may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather @entity196 , who is venerated in @entity0 as the nation 's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state , with the title @entity202			1
@entity7 has not been a presence in state media since attending a @entity6 concert on september 3			1
there 's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian @entity57 's media			0
@entity0 's official @entity210 says the @entity57 approved the promotion of @entity212 as the vice chairman of the country 's powerful @entity214			0
@entity7 's unhealthy obsession with @entity189 has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of @entity0 struggling to find enough to eat			1
malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country , which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of @entity228 support in the 1990s			0
but despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens , @entity7 continues to gorge on @entity13 cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate , according to the @entity235			1
@entity0 who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather @entity196			1
he established an all - pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning @entity0 into a oppressive single - party socialist state in the early 1980s			0
defector @entity245 , of the @entity246 , said : ' @entity0 think being fat is good , unlike @entity248 who want to be skinny			0
' there is a high chance @entity7 intentionally gained weight to look like @entity253 - sung			1

@entity7 has not been photographed in public since september 3
he has been seen walking with a limp , raising speculation it may be gout
31 - year - old imports vast quantities of @entity189 - his favourite variety
his weight has ballooned in recent months and he now walks with a limp
