by @entity0 last updated at 11:24 am on 4th july 2011 a @entity2 woman who has cost the @entity3 up to £ 200,000 after flying into @entity4 while expecting quintuplets is to fight for the right to stay			1
@entity7 , 33 , who had been taking double doses of a fertility drug while in @entity10 , applied for a six - month visitor ’s visa within days of discovering she was pregnant			1
busy : an operating theatre at @entity15 - one of @entity16 's busiest - where mrs @entity17 gave birth as soon as it was granted , she travelled to the @entity4 without her husband late last year on the pretence of visiting her three sisters			1
an emergency nhs scan showed she was expecting four babies			2
owing to the size and complexity of the birth , she underwent a caesarean section 32 weeks into her pregnancy on april 28			2
during the procedure at @entity15 in @entity16 , doctors discovered there was a fifth child			2
she gave birth to two boys , @entity37 and @entity38 , and three girls : @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
although she was due to leave last week , she believes the children are too frail to travel and has instructed lawyers to seek an extension to her visitor ’s visa			0
the total bill to the taxpayer for mrs @entity17 ’s care alone is expected to reach £ 200,000 , which she is unable to pay			1
the five babies were all treated in a special care unit because they were born prematurely , at a cost of £ 1,000 a day for each of them			1
consequently , the cost of a week ’s hospital care for the family would be a staggering £ 35,000 for the taxpayer			1
the issue has raised yet again the issue of so - called ‘ health tourism ’ – in which foreigners can use @entity4 ’s state - funded health system			1
it is estimated to cost the @entity3 £ 200million a year			1
foreign nationals should be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive , with most hospitals employing overseas visitor managers whose job is to identify those who must pay			1
but urgent treatment such as maternity care will always be provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay			1
hospitals must then take reasonable measures to recover any debts from overseas patients			0
many bills are never settled , however			0
and border officials repeatedly report seeing passengers arriving in an advanced state of pregnancy after securing a visitor ’s visa			1
around 150 cases a year are identified at @entity90			0
expensive : the cost of a week 's hospital care for the five babies is a staggering £ 35,000 for the taxpayer ( file photo ) mrs @entity17 , whose 37 - year - old husband , @entity96 , remains in @entity2 , has signed a five - figure deal with a red - top newspaper			1
she said in an interview : ‘ i had already had miscarriages and could n’t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause			0
so i decided to visit my family in @entity16			0
i thought i would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family			0
‘ now if i go back i ’ll be on my own without even a roof over my head			0
my entire family support network – three sisters , four aunts and virtually all my school friends – live here			0
’ mrs @entity17 says she was unaware she was expecting as many as five children			0
the multiple birth is the likely result of the fertility drug @entity118 , which she purchased over the counter in her home city of @entity122			0
she began taking two pills a day – double the normal dose – and continued the regime for eight times longer than recommended			0
her children are being cared for with the help of her 26 - year - old sister @entity129 , with whom she is living at a two - bedroom flat in @entity131 , @entity16			2
‘ the @entity3 is a national health service , not an international one			2
' mrs @entity17 , who is not entitled to any state benefits and does not have the right to work , says she is struggling to pay for her family , with nappies and milk powder alone costing her £ 70 a week			1
despite being born in the @entity4 , the children do not have an automatic right to @entity4 citizenship			1
to qualify , they would need at least one parent who is @entity4 , or who has indefinite leave to remain in the country			1
a spokesman for the @entity146 said : ‘ the @entity3 is a national health service , not an international one			2
we expect those with no right to be in the @entity4 to leave voluntarily otherwise we will seek to remove them			1
’ the @entity152 can deny someone entry into the country if they believe they are seeking free healthcare			0
but the rules are hard to enforce			0
in march , the government announced plans to tackle health tourism			2
measures include preventing anyone who owes the @entity3 more than £ 1,000 from entering the country until the debt is paid off			2
last night , from behind a closed door , mrs @entity17 said : ‘ i am not happy about what has been written about me , that is not what i told them			0
you need to speak to my lawyer , i do not want to comment			0
