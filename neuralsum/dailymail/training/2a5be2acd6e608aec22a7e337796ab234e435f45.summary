by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 02:21 est , 22 april 2013 condemned : @entity1 , a former @entity2 councillor for @entity3 a @entity2 councillor was forced to resign last night after suggesting inner - city children from a ‘ coloured area ’ would not be welcome at a proposed new school in the countryside			1
@entity1 , 73 , said the youngsters could ‘ escape into the forest ’ and trigger a ‘ sexual volcano ’ because they had been ‘ plucked from their natural surroundings ’			1
announcing his resignation last night , he said : ‘ my remarks were plainly wrong			2
they were thoughtless and extremely foolish			0
i unreservedly apologise and withdraw them			0
i very much regret the distress this must have caused			0
’ @entity20 education spokesman @entity19 called for @entity21 to condemn the comments			2
he said : ‘ when a @entity2 councillor makes openly racist comments like these , it ’s no surprise people still think of the conservatives as the nasty party			1
’ a @entity2 spokesman said last night that the process had begun to suspend mr @entity1 , adding : ‘ these comments are totally unacceptable			1
’ the high - performing state - run @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , is planning to open a boarding school in an affluent rural area of @entity40			1
it hopes to send 600 teenagers there every monday morning for lessons and bring them back on friday evenings free of charge , so they can enjoy an ‘ @entity49 - style experience ’ away from violent crime in their local area			1
but there has been strong opposition from people living near the disused boarding school in the quiet village of @entity55 , overlooking the @entity56			1
they fear a ‘ tranquil place ’ would be ruined by ‘ bringing @entity58 to the countryside ’			2
one resident even claimed the students would be ‘ searched daily for weapons ’			2
education secretary @entity64 waded into the row , accusing those who oppose the plan of ‘ trying to obstruct an inspirational project ’ , but it is mr @entity1 ’s incendiary comments that have provoked the most anger			1
he said : ‘ ninety - seven per cent of pupils will be black or @entity73			1
if they ’re @entity76 , they ’ll rise to the top			0
if they ’re @entity80 , they ’ll rise to the top			0
if they ’re @entity84 , they wo n’t			0
plans : former boarding school @entity86 in @entity88 which has been bought by the @entity35 in @entity36 ‘ there are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued			1
there are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about			0
‘ if the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity36 is a coloured area – i have no problem with that			1
’ the row will be particularly uncomfortable for the @entity106 as it comes days after mr @entity21 was warned he must woo non-white voters to have any chance of winning the next election			0
lord @entity110 , the pollster and former @entity2 donor , said the party won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the general election in 2010			0
in a hard - hitting critique , he said : ‘ we must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country , and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them			2
’ @entity122 of his eye : the academy , in @entity36 , is one of the best in @entity37 and is a favourite of education secretary @entity64 dozens of residents attended a public meeting in the affluent nearby village of @entity131 , where actor @entity132 has a home , to oppose the @entity135 development for a variety of reasons , including traffic and the size of the project			1
but one unnamed resident said : ‘ you must be wary about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives			0
’ mr @entity1 has lived in the area for 40 years			1
he lives with his wife @entity147 a few hundred yards from @entity55			0
@entity149 , chairman of the @entity150 with @entity152 parish council , says the plans are ‘ ill conceived ’ , and she fears the village will be left with a ‘ white elephant ’			2
shock : @entity35 chief @entity157 has described the attitude of residents as ' shocking ' but has vowed to press on with the scheme she added : ‘ i ca n’t comment on what councillor @entity1 has said – we have had two public meetings and that has not been a view i have heard			1
but there is quite a lot of opposition – it ’s a development the size of three superstores			0
‘ where is the evidence that shows pupils ’ attainment levels are improved by being in a rural environment ? they would be better off building them a better school in @entity36			1
’ @entity135 ’s director of education , @entity157 , said residents ’ comments had been ‘ shocking ’ but he vowed to press ahead			2
the school is rated as outstanding by @entity183			0
the staff and governors used the proceeds from @entity135 ’s leisure and student accommodation business to buy @entity191 - listed @entity190 ’s school for £ 3.4million in 2010			2
mr @entity157 added : ‘ i ’ve heard a few comments			0
it ’s sad , but it makes us want to fight harder , and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities , i ’m sure he will change his tune			0
you will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices			0
