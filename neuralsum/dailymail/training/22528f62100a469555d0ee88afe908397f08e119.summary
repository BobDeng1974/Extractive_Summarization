a @entity1 airman accused of aggravated assault for exposing multiple sex partners to @entity4 at swinger parties in @entity6 will have his appeal heard this week before the nation 's highest military court			1
@entity10 was a sergeant at @entity11 in @entity6 in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years in prison			1
but in an appeal that could upend similar prosecutions in the @entity18 military , the @entity14 will take up his case on tuesday			2
' this case will have the potential of decriminalizing sexual contact with someone with @entity4 , ' defense attorney @entity20 said			2
landmark appeal : @entity6 airman @entity10 , who was jailed for eight years for failing to tell sexual partners he has @entity4 , will testify that medical advances in @entity4 treatment mean the laws are outdated in addition aggravated assault , @entity10 also was found guilty of violating an order to notify partners about his @entity4 status and to use condoms			1
he was also convicted of indecent acts and adultery			0
he has not been accused of actually infecting anyone with @entity4			2
in his appeal , @entity10 has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault			1
he will argue that laws covering exposure to the disease are outdated since the statistical probability of heterosexual transmission is low and medical advances have made the disease treatable			1
' about 100 years ago we used to have a lot of laws on the books that threw people in prison for having syphilis because you could n't cure it			2
once they came up with a cure a lot of those laws went along the wayside , ' @entity20 said			0
the risk of infection by an hiv - positive man during sexual intercourse with a woman varies widely , and each side in the case is citing the statistic within that range that is most favorable to their argument			0
defense lawyers say the risk of infection ranged from a 1 - in - 10,000 to 1 - in - 100,000 chance per sexual encounter , which they contend is so low that it does n't meet the legal standard for assault			1
prosecutors , however , counter that the exposure risk was closer to 1 in 500			0
' a 1 - in - 500 chance of receiving a deadly , incurable disease is not merely fanciful , speculative , or remote possibility			0
it is a real possibility , ' they wrote			0
@entity10 was a sergeant at @entity11 in @entity6 in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank ' that real possibility of harm , when balanced with the magnitude of harm , certain death , provides more than enough justification to hold ( @entity10 ) criminally liable here			1
' government lawyers argued at trial that @entity10 played @entity102 roulette with his sexual partners ' lives and several people who had sex with @entity10 and his wife testified that they would not have done so if they had known he was @entity4 - positive			1
the government is playing up that testimony on appeal			0
the case could have a broad sweep , since defense attorneys in a similar case winding through the @entity116 appeals process have gotten involved with a rare friend - of - court filing			0
in that brief , defense lawyers said an ' epidemic of fear ' pervaded the nation in the in the mid- 1980s , when many of the applicable laws were written			0
they said that panic led to an expansion of criminal liability , and they urged the military appellate court to see @entity4 as a treatable condition			1
as of early this year , there had been more than 900 arrests or prosecutions in at least 38 states and the military of hiv - positive people accused of exposing others to the disease , according to the @entity139 of people living with @entity4			2
defense lawyers also say @entity10 should n't have been convicted of adultery since he and his wife participated in group sex			1
they also contend that their client 's due process rights have been violated by a long appeals process			0
@entity149 prosecutors have declined comment .			0

@entity10 was jailed for 8 years and stripped of sergeant rank in 2011
he was convicted of not telling partners he has @entity4 , plus aggravated assault
@entity157 will hear his claim that laws are outdated and @entity4 risk is low
he will claim medical advances have made the disease treatable
the appeal could decriminalize knowingly having sex with @entity4
