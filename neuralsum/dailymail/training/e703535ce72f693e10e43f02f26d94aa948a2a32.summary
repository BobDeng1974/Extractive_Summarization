the new wife of @entity2 superstar @entity1 said yesterday that @entity3 has ‘ just cause ’ in its fight for the return of the @entity7			1
and lawyer @entity8 claimed @entity9 should be embarrassed about how some works of the 5th - century @entity11 have been split between @entity12 and @entity13			1
mrs @entity8 is part of a high profile legal team from @entity12 advising the @entity3 government on possible action in the international court to force the @entity20 to hand over the marbles			1
‘ the @entity3 government has just cause and it ’s time for the @entity20 to recognise that and return them to @entity3 , ’ she declared			2
‘ the injustice has persisted for too long			0
‘ the @entity3 government has the right to ask for the return of the marbles , 200 years after they were taken to the @entity9 , ’ she told the gathering at the @entity41 where @entity3 displays the friezes that it kept when @entity43 took half of them in the early 1800s			1
admiration : @entity49 is guided around the @entity26 museum to look at some of the classical pieces of sculpture the fact that individual friezes had been split between @entity12 and @entity13 should be embarrassing to the @entity20 , she continued , highlighting an example of the figure of a horseman , whose head is in @entity13 and body in @entity12			2
‘ that means that nobody can celebrate the marbles united , in the place that they came from , ’ she said			2
mrs @entity8 , who married the @entity2 heart - throb in @entity68 last month , said she and the respected , veteran human rights lawyer @entity69 , had first been asked by the @entity3 for advice on the contentious issue in 2011			1
‘ it is sad to note that three years later , one of the most beautiful pieces of art in the world has still not been reunited for everyone to behold , ’ said mrs @entity8			1
fellow lawyer @entity78 said he hoped a ‘ conciliatory and amicable resolution ’ could be found			0
mrs @entity8 said she became involved in the ' just cause ' of returning the @entity7 to @entity3 three years ago , and described it as ' sad ' that no progress had yet been made ‘ if it can not , then other considerations will have to be examined , ’ he added			1
@entity3 has delighted in the celebrity of mrs @entity8 – yesterday she met with @entity3 prime minister @entity86 - and her association with the long - running dispute is certain to raise its profile			1
after more than a century of fruitless lobbying , @entity3 is now pinning its hopes of reclaiming the sculptures from @entity9 on a mediation effort backed by the @entity95 cultural agency and advised by the @entity12 - based lawyers			1
culture minister @entity97 said yesterday @entity98 has urged @entity9 to consider a year - old mediation proposal to resolve the world ’s most famous heritage dispute			0
the marble sculptures were removed to @entity9 - illegally , according to @entity3 - from the @entity104 temple on the @entity26 in the early 19th century			1
the @entity20 , where they are displayed , and the @entity9 government say the works are better off in @entity12			0
international debate : @entity49 with @entity69 ( @entity109 ) and @entity3 culture minister @entity110 mr @entity97 has played down taking the issue to the international court			2
the 7th @entity43 , @entity113 , removed the @entity115 sculptures from the @entity26 in @entity13 while serving as the @entity9 ambassador to the @entity117 from 1799 to 1803			0
in 1801 , the @entity43 claimed to have obtained a permit from the @entity117 authorities to remove pieces from the @entity104 and his agents removed half of the surviving sculptures , as well as architectural members and sculpture from the @entity126 and @entity127			1
they were shipped to @entity9 , but in @entity3 , the @entity130 aristocrat was accused of looting			2
they were bought by the @entity9 government to be displayed in the @entity20			0
mrs @entity8 told a packed news conference that the @entity20 should be ' embarrassed ' that individual friezes had been split so viewers in neither country could fully enjoy them the marble sculptures were removed to @entity9 from the @entity104 temple on the @entity26 in the early 19th century - illegally , according to @entity3 @entity1 himself backed the campaign earlier this year , when asked by a reporter at the @entity143			1
‘ i think you have a very good case to make about your artefacts , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe it would n’t be a bad thing if they were returned			0
that is a good idea , a fair thing to do			0
’ a video presentation watched by the 1.2 million tourists who visit the @entity41 each year describes the ‘ systematic looting of the @entity104 , especially by @entity43			2
’ the @entity9 diplomat ‘ proceeded to violently remove and carry off much of the sculpture , ’ the documentary explains			0
‘ the stone blocks were too heavy to carry away so @entity162 ’s team used iron bars to detach the friezes ’ ” said the museum official			0
‘ by just taking the most beautiful , sculpted part , he ruined the whole block each time			0
’ the 7th @entity43 , @entity113 , removed the @entity115 sculptures from the @entity26 in @entity13 while serving as the @entity9 ambassador to the @entity117			0
