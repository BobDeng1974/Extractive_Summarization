fantasy : items similar to the type @entity8 , 21 , stole from more than 100 players of the online game @entity11			1
he sold his hoard of items like capes , swords , gold and armour on fan forums for up to £ 3,000 popular : the game has run since 2001 and has more than 200 million users who ' train up ' and fight monsters @entity9 @entity17 heard @entity8 sold his victims ' virtual items on auction sites and forums to raise up to £ 3,000			1
many of his victims complained to the game 's developer , @entity46 - taking up 1,000 hours of the company 's time			0
@entity11 was launched by @entity50 brothers @entity51 and @entity46 in 2001 and has since become the largest online role - playing game in the world			1
its 200 million players gain skills like mining , cooking , fishing and fighting and collect hundreds of items ranging from lobsters to swords			1
the most dedicated players are fiercely competitive and spend real - world money to help them gain fantasy ' skills ' more quickly			1
one user on sythe.org was selling 30 million gold pieces for $ 11.88 ( £ 7.27 ) - a practice banned by administrators but hard to police			2
another sold a rare commemorative @entity75 hat , which has no function other than kudos with the online community , for $ 40 ( £ 25 )			2
one full account for sale on @entity81 today had more than 25 bids topping £ 40			0
but these amounts are chicken feed compared to the wealth of the game 's founders - who together were ranked @entity50 's 740th richest people in this year 's @entity89			0
@entity90 , 34 , sold his stake in the game for £ 88m in 2011 while @entity93 , 36 , and his family retain a stake worth £ 14m			1
yet @entity8 was charged with hacking , not theft , because the items he stole existed in a fantasy world			1
databases and password - cracking software were found on @entity8 ’s computer , which the court was told he went to ' great lengths ' to hide			2
the 21 - year - old was cautioned in july 2012 by @entity106 in relation to compromising a @entity109 account of a @entity46 employee			0
he was then arrested in april this year , after which he emailed @entity46 to apologise			0
but he later hacked their game another 27 times , leading to a second arrest in july and criminal charges			0
he pleaded guilty to two charges of unauthorised computer access after the court heard he accessed player accounts 3,872 times , modifying 105 accounts			0
the game is the largest of its kind in the world			2
prosecutor @entity128 said : ' this activity relates to an online game called @entity11			1
' it is recognised as one of the largest games currently in existence , taking place in the realm of a medieval fantasy world			1
' players have characters and they acquire resources			0
they have a real - world value			0
' what the prosecution say is mr @entity8 has acquired some of these unlawfully			2
' to do this , he accessed other players ’ accounts , and has gone on to sell the items on auction sites and forums			2
' by his own admission , he has made between £ 2,500 and £ 3,000			1
it is quite clear he has invested quite a lot of time and energy in this pursuit			0
' his principal motivation was to gain kudos among people on the internet			0
once a player has lost gaming resources , there is no redress			0
' kudos : characters are respected in the online world for fantasy skills such as mining , fishing and cookery players trading for virtual money			1
the court heard @entity8 was ' foolish ' but made up to £ 3,000 in real money online world : the game is popular and has made its founders , @entity50 brothers @entity51 and @entity46 , £ 100m @entity179 , defending , said @entity8 was ' foolish ' and used fantasy to deal with problems in the real world			1
he added : ' he is a normal , rational human being , whose course of conduct has clearly caused a lot of trouble			0
' he used a fantasy world to try to deal with problems in the real world , which were financial and related to gambling			1
' it is clear he did not consider the long - term consequences because that world was not real			0
' @entity8 was handed a 12 - month community order and made to perform 150 hours of unpaid work			2
he was also ordered to pay £ 100 costs and a £ 60 victim surcharge , and to forfeit his two computers			0
another hacker was arrested for accessing @entity11 accounts in 2009 in what was , at the time , the first arrest of its kind			2
and in may this year @entity205 , 19 , from @entity206 , was given an eight - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 16 compensation to a friend whose @entity11 money he stole			1
@entity8 refused to comment outside court .			0

@entity8 , 21 , spent 16 months hacking player profiles on @entity11
