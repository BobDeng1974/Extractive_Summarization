mrs @entity25 , who lived with her husband in @entity27 , @entity28 , said in a statement : ' the sun was very bright and low that day , and it would have been full in his face			0
' the most likely explanation , i believe , is that he was dazzled and disorientated by the sun. he stumbled on the wheel and stepped into the propeller while trying to get his balance			1
' an @entity41 report published last october , after the accident on january 28 , suggested that mr @entity2 might not have heard the propeller because he was wearing headphones			1
it also suggested he might not have seen the propeller , even though the tips of the blades were different colours			1
finally , it said that the wind produced by the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly strong and he might not have felt it			0
the report stated the accident illustrated the importance of pilots following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving an aircraft to ensure safe clearance			2
@entity62 , mr @entity2 ’s student on the day of the tragedy , described him as one of the most experienced pilots he knew			1
he said he saw mr @entity66 , a @entity67 coach , climb out of the aircraft at and they then had a brief conversation			0
shocking : mr @entity2 died instantly from massive head injuries after he was hit by the plane 's propellers at @entity73 in @entity14 he added : ' he turned towards the front of the aircraft			1
the next thing i knew the engine had stopped			0
i really had no idea what had happened			0
' another pilot , @entity81 , said he was about 100 yards away from the scene			2
he said : ' the aeroplane was stationary			0
i noticed the door / window open and @entity85 getting out			0
i waited to watch @entity87 ’s first circuit			0
' when @entity85 got out of the aircraft he turned and walked away			0
he walked towards the front of the aircraft and he made contact with the propeller			1
' @entity41 investigator @entity92 told the inquest that it was impossible to confirm the exact cause of the accident			0
unexplained death : mr @entity2 's widow @entity20 said he had decades of flying experience and she did not believe he had mistakenly stepped into the propeller of the @entity24 - 65 light aircraft ( stock image ) he said there was some debate about whether the engine of a stationary aircraft should be turned off or left on for safety reasons if it was about to fly again			1
if it was turned off , it would have to be restarted by hand which carried some risk as it would then entail someone having to hand - start the propeller to start it up again			2
he said of 15 previous air accidents involving propellers , ten had been caused by them being hand - started , and five by the engine being left on			0
a post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was severe head injuries as a result of being hit by an aeroplane propeller			1
@entity14 coroner @entity122 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
mr @entity2 had a total of 14,709 hours ' flying experience			1

mr @entity136 , 67 , said : ' i can not believe what has happened			2
@entity85 was a highly skilled pilot			2
if you were going to fly with somebody he was the man you would choose			2
' he was very well respected all over the world - i have received tributes from @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 from people who knew @entity85			0
' l taught his wife @entity154 to fly			0
they keep their own @entity157 plane on their farm - it was @entity85 ’s pride and joy			0
