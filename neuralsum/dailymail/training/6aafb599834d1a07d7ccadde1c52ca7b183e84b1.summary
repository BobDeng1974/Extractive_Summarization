under pressure from high - profile police tactics that have led to the break - up of dozens of criminal networks in the capital , drug dealers are shifting their operations to areas in the @entity6 considered a ‘ soft touch ’			0
over the past six months 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 have been arrested in @entity13 and @entity14 carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin			1
many are forced to stash the drugs under their clothes as they travel by train from the gang ’s south - east @entity2 stronghold to a series of rented houses where they deal on the streets			2

detective superintendent @entity124 , of @entity126 central gangs unit , told the @entity127 : ‘ this is a gang that has evolved to use children			2
the controllers of the network stay in @entity2 most of the time and use the young people to take all the risks involved in drug dealing			2
‘ it means all the points where they could be intercepted with drugs is taken by these young people			0
‘ they can recruit through schools or other means			0
‘ they are given the promise of money or goods in exchange which never materialises			0
‘ if drugs are lost or seized debts are incurred and the links to the organised criminal network strengthens			0
it does n’t start with a threat , it starts with a promise			0
it will become mental or physical abuse at the end			0

although many of @entity2 ’s gangs are territorial , based on postcodes and estates , the crackdown has led to a spike in offences being committed outside the capital as groups spread into new potentially lucrative areas			0
but neighbouring forces are waking up to the new problem on their doorstep			0
@entity183 superintendent @entity182 said : ‘ to use teenagers to commit those crimes is despicable and would have far reaching consequences for them , as well as the public , if police had n’t intervened to disrupt this @entity2 based organised crime gang			1
‘ @entity13 is the gateway to the @entity191 and @entity192 and criminals may think that because of our location we are a soft touch			0
our message to anyone who thinks they can pedal their crimes in our county is do so at your own risk			0
’ detective chief inspector @entity204 from @entity205 added : ‘ we identified that drug gangs from @entity2 were sending young people into @entity38 to deal			2
these young people are themselves victims and we have taken steps to safeguard them and to work with them			0
