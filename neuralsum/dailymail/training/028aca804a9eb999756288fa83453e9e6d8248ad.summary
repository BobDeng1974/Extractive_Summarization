if you are looking for a loan , serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick			0
a compound found in eggs makes people much more generous , new research suggests			1
scientists say that tryptophan , an amino acid found in some foods , can change our behaviour			1
psychologists from @entity15 in the @entity16 say that a compound found in eggs ( stock image shown ) can increase generosity			1
in their study tryptophan made volunteers donate more money			1
@entity24 , which eggs are rich in , is an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel - good chemical serotonin in experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity			1
eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan , an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel - good chemical serotonin			1
the substance is also marketed as a food supplement called @entity24			2
psychologists from @entity15 in the @entity16 , writing in the @entity48 journal , said : ‘ for the first time , we investigated whether the administration of a compound contained in food such as fish , eggs , soy , and milk can promote charitable donating			1
oxytocin is released in response to physical touch and is associated with maternal nurturing , social attachments , childbirth and sex			0
it is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair			0
the hormone is injected to induce labour and a new study claims it could one day be used to slow down muscle wasting in the elderly			2
research has shown so far that it does not cause cancer when injected and could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster			0
levels of oxytocin are high in children , but it is not known when levels of the hormone start to decline and how much is needed to maintain healthy tissues			2
previous research found that administering oxytocin helped prevent the development of osteoporosis in mice			2
‘ our study is the first demonstration that charitable donating can be enhanced by serotonin - related food supplements			2
’ the authors carried out an experiment on 32 men and women , in which half were given a powder containing 0.8 grams of @entity24 , and the others were given a harmless placebo powder			2
each participant was given £ 7.50 ( $ 11.25 ) for taking part in the research and asked whether they were willing to donate part of their financial reward to charity			0
four boxes for @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113 were left on a table			0
when the psychologists counted the takings , they found that those given the @entity24 powder donated an average of 75p ( $ 1.15 ) , while those who received the placebo donated half as much			1
just how a food supplement could have such an effect is not clear , but the scientists suggest the involvement of oxytocin , the so - called ‘ cuddle ’ hormone produced by women during breastfeeding and lovemaking			1
need a bank loan ? perhaps you should make sure your manager has eaten eggs for breakfast			0
just how a food supplement could have such an effect is not clear , but the scientists suggest the involvement of oxytocin , the so - called ‘ cuddle ’ hormone produced by women during breastfeeding and lovemaking the researchers point to the closeness of the areas of the brain associated with serotonin and oxytocin			1
they wrote : ‘ it may be likely that the willingness to donate money to a charity is modulated by the effect that serotonin exerts on oxytocin levels			1
‘ our results support the materialist approach that “ you are what you eat ”			0
‘ the idea [ is ] that the food one eats has a bearing on one ’s state of mind			0
the food we eat may thus act as a cognitive enhancer that modulates the way we deal with the “ social ” world			0
' commenting on the research , dr @entity170 , neurobiologist at @entity171 , said the study could be useful in prisons to encourage harmony among inmates			0
he said : ‘ these results are interesting because they raise the possibility that dietary supplements containing @entity24 could be used to assist with boosting charitable attitudes and behaviour in the population			0
