mrs @entity5 , a healthcare assistant and author from @entity28 , said : ' thinking back , i regretted breaking up with @entity8 as soon as i said the words			1
it was a moment of madness - one i often returned to , even though i later made a completely separate life from him			2
' i ’m so happy that we ’re back together now			2
' mr and mrs @entity5 first met in june 1981 when she was introduced to him by a friend at youth club			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' i ’d known of him because we went to the same school			1
he was too shy to ask me out so his friend did instead			2

even after 25 years apart , the pair still thought of each other and were eventually reintroduced through @entity8 's sister ' it was very exciting			1
he was grinning at me with a cheeky smile			2
' i knew fairly quickly that he was the one for me			0
' the couple began a four - year relationship and became engaged when they turned 18 years old			1
but as time went on , mrs @entity5 became fed up by mr @entity8 ’ habit of spending time with his friends rather than her			1
she said : ' i decided to give him an ultimatum			0
i told him love me or leave me - that unless he spent more time with me and kept the dates we made , i would break it off with him			0
' it was a gamble on my part			0
i did n’t really want to break up with him , and i thought by giving him a shock it would bring him closer to me			0
' unfortunately , the plan backfired and he broke up with me			0
' as the years went by , both went their separate ways and eventually lost contact all together			1
mrs @entity5 went on to marry in february 1992 and had a daughter , now 28			1

we ’d had a dream of moving to the @entity92 and had been on a few trips there			0
we once disturbed a wasp nest and had to run into the sea together to escape the wasps			0
' we were young and daft and the memories from those days made me smile when i was feeling low			0
' shortly after her separation mrs @entity5 discovered that mr @entity8 ’s sister was on the social networking site @entity102 , and they struck up a friendship			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' one afternoon i asked her what she was doing that day , and she mentioned that she was going off to @entity8 ’s birthday barbeque			1
' he was house - sharing with a friend at that time			0
i discovered that he ’d been married but his relationship had come to an end and in fact he had been single for 11 years			2
' i asked her to wish him a happy birthday from me and left it at that			0
' to her surprise , mr @entity8 sent her a text message the following day			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' his sister must have passed on my number			1
the text read : ‘ thanks for the birthday message ’			0
i was in a hurry , so rather grumpily replied : ‘ who ’s this ? ’ ' the reply came back : ‘ someone from over 25 years ago - take a guess ’			2
the pair say they feel lucky to have been given a second chance to be together ' when i realised who it was , i had butterflies in my stomach			0
we began chatting and he said the next time i was in the south , we should go for dinner			2
' the couple began regularly dating and in 2010 mr @entity8 moved from his shared house in south @entity88 to live with her in @entity28			1

' on june 9th 2012 , 31 years to the day that the couple first met , they finally wed. mrs @entity5 said : ' it was an incredible day but things did n’t exactly go according to plan			1
firstly , my horse and carriage could n’t make its way to the service because there was a gay pride march along the route			0
' i called a taxi but someone jumped into it before i could reach it			0
i ended up running across some tramlines in my wedding dress , as people looked on			2
i almost fell flat on my face			0
' it was almost as if fate was trying to keep us apart again , but i fought to get there on time			0
' by the time i got to the service i was so hysterical that i could n’t stop laughing			0
the two of us giggled all the way through the wedding			0
it was a wonderful , unusual day			2
' mr @entity8 , who works at a biscuit factory , said : ' i was nervous about moving up to live with @entity5 at first , of course , but since then life has been amazing			1
