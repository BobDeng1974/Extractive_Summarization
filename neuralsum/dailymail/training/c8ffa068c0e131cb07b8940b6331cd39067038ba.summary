by @entity0 as an oppressively hot and dusty lord ’s afternoon dawdled towards its concluding stages , @entity1 found the edge of @entity7 ’s bat and @entity8 held the routine catch			2
a slumbering lord ’s came abruptly to life			0
a spasm of relief ran through the @entity15 fielders , while @entity16 danced his delight , swapping high - fives and thumping backs			1
at @entity1 ’s next delivery , @entity20 shouldered arms , and the swinging ball punished his rashness by flicking the top of off stump			0
this time the reaction was clamorous			0
his time is now : @entity16 must stand up and lead @entity15 to victory with a big score to even has a chance of retaining his captaincy past the second test against @entity34 at @entity35 poor form : @entity16 ( centre ) looks despondent as he walks off after being dismissed while @entity38 celebrate the ranks of egg - and - bacon striped ties came tottering to their feet			1
the drinkers in the @entity43 pushed aside their fizz and hurried back to the grandstand			2
@entity16 danced with more urgency , bawled with more vigour			1
three overs later , a brute of a lifter from @entity50 took @entity53 ’s armguard and floated high behind square on the leg side , where the diving prior plucked the catch			0
the umpire , deceived , lifted a finger , and the old ground erupted in a merry madness			0
three wickets had fallen for five runs in 19 balls			0
a match which had promised @entity15 only pain and extended suffering was now alive with possibilities			1
when @entity16 looks back on his career as @entity15 captain , these are the moments he will treasure			1
sadly , such moments have been too few , and the time for rueful reminiscence is drawing closer			0
the termination of an @entity15 captain is not easily achieved			1
whereas an unsuccessful football manager or an unpopular @entity80 may be packed off in short order , the sacking of the cricket skipper is something akin to the defrocking of an archbishop			0
it is done only after immense official consideration and wide - ranging public debate			0
well , both conditions have been fulfilled and , even if @entity15 were to win a notable victory in this @entity91 , the signs are @entity16 may not survive			1
ca n't buy a run : cook averages just 24 with the bat in the last year and has not scored a century in 26 innings pondering : @entity15 coach @entity96 stuck with @entity16 when he took over but must make a decision now @entity16 will be glad to see the back of 2014 , a year which has seen his @entity15 captaincy called into serious question			1
the opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and , as his team toils against @entity34 at @entity35 , @entity101 takes a look at where it all went wrong : january questions begin to be asked over @entity16 ’s captaincy as @entity15 lose the @entity109 series in @entity110 5 - 0			1
january @entity16 captains @entity15 in the odi series but is unable to make a big contribution as @entity15 lose 4 - 1			1
january @entity15 coach @entity113 resigns but under - fire @entity16 vows to continue as captain and is backed by the @entity115			1
february fall - out from @entity109 continues as the @entity115 axe batsman @entity117 effectively ending his @entity15 career			1
may @entity16 ’s mentor @entity119 is sacked as @entity15 batting coach — on the captain ’s advice			1
june more doubts are raised over @entity16 ’s captaincy as the opener is dismissed for just 17 in the first test against @entity38			1
he scores only 28 in the second innings , before making just 17 and 16 in the second test			1
july dismissed for just five runs in the first test against @entity34 at @entity131 , before getting out for only 10 in the first innings of @entity133			1
to watch him at work on saturday was to study a man painfully aware of his predicament			0
he stood hopefully at first slip through much of the long day , crouching as @entity50 or @entity1 , @entity139 or @entity140 hustled in			0
he would bring his hands together in supplication , watching the ball fly past to the keeper , then placing one hand beneath his chin while the other propped an elbow			0
from time to time , he would exchange a few words with prior , another @entity15 player on @entity151 , if the rumours are true			1
then , at the end of the over , he would gather up the close fielder ’s helmet and jog dutifully to the other end			0
at one stage after tea , the entire @entity15 team gathered around the drinks waiters as @entity7 was treated for a minor injury			1
@entity16 stood his ground , quite alone , staring into the middle distance			2
you never saw a man look quite so lonely			0
it is said that @entity16 does not sweat			2
it is difficult to determine if that is a tribute to his glands or his temperament , but it is the reason why he is the fielder chosen to handle the new ball on its way back to the bowler			2
and yet , with the pressures mounting and the speculation raging , one imagines that the hands must have been more than a touch damp as @entity34 ’s total took shape			2
nervous times : @entity16 could find his position untenable if @entity15 continue their poor form against @entity34 you found yourself trying to recall other , equally unfortunate , captains : @entity188 , or the chap who presided over the @entity190			1
but precious few have stirred the sympathy in the manner of poor @entity16			2
the ancients , in merciless mood , combined to criticise the skipper for his failings			0
@entity198 , most cerebral of former skippers , conceded that @entity16 was vulnerable			2
he understood , all too well : ‘ you feel awful , you begin to doubt , and you need a lot of support around you , ’ he said			0
@entity204 , more forthright , announced that @entity16 desperately needed runs in @entity15 ’s second innings			1
‘ if he does n’t , he should leave himself out , ’ said @entity204			0
‘ it ’s not helping the team			0
’ when men as different as @entity198 and @entity204 make common cause , then the writing is spreading all over the wall			2
in fairness , @entity16 is being attacked for all manner of perceived failings , some of them quite delusory			2
in this match , for instance , he has been pilloried for his ‘ failure ’ to reprimand his quick bowlers for their wasteful line and length on the opening morning			0
while a public rebuke might have been excellent public relations , one wonders why the bowlers themselves had no awareness of the appropriate plans			0
but once a captain is at bay , any stick will do			0
lack of support : @entity235 ( centre ) reacted angrily when asked about @entity16 's ( right ) future by journalists he wears a faintly haggard look , like one who knows he is the subject of too many conversations , one who has overheard things which are certainly unkind but which might well be true			1
you suspect he is now listening to the critics ; not the knee - jerk dullards who yearn for the restoration of @entity117 , but those who wish @entity16 well and have come to believe that a rest - hopefully temporary - would be the kindest course			1
he may well score the big second - innings hundred of which @entity204 spoke , but even that may not be sufficient			1
in any case , what score would merit another @entity91 , another chance ? sixty ? seventy ? ninety ? the fact that we can indulge in such speculation is testimony to his plight			2
for the plot has moved on , and what was once mischievous speculation has now become a matter of time			0
through all his trials , @entity16 has handled himself with appealing dignity			2
he has concentrated on his team , probably at the expense of his personal form , and he is paying the protracted price			0
if he does decide to go - and the decision must surely be his own - then one hopes that his return will not be long delayed			0
he is a considerable man and a considerable cricketer			0
and he will surely know better days , when he can dance his delight and flap his high - fives , and bring the champagne guzzlers hustling in from the @entity43 , to join his @entity15 party			2
d - day : @entity16 must lead his side to victory with a big score against @entity34 to have any chance of keeping his job			1

the writing appears to be on the wall for @entity16 's @entity15 captaincy
a big score in the second innings for @entity15 against @entity34 in the second test at @entity35 may not even be enough to save his job
if he does go then he can have a rest and hopefully come back *refreshed*
