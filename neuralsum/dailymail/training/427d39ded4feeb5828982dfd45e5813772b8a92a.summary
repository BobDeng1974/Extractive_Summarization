a young athlete who dreamed of playing college basketball will get her chance to start in her first game - even though she has an inoperable brain tumor and just weeks to live			1
@entity5 , 19 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , was a standout high school player who committed to playing at @entity8 , also in @entity7 , in october of last year			1
then , last november , she found out she had an inoperable brain tumor			1
not that even that was enough to stop @entity5 , who has diffused @entity26 , a cancer with roots at the base of her brain stem with growing tentacles weaving through her nerves			2
' i never gave up for a second even when i got a terminal diagnosis ; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore , ' she told local 12			0
and now she will be getting to fulfill her dream of playing college ball , thanks to some help from her school and the @entity42			1
during her surprise birthday party on october 1 , exactly one year from the date she signed to play at @entity45			0
@entity46 , @entity5 learned that the school contacted the @entity42 who agreed to move up their opening game against @entity50 from november 15 to november 1 so she can take the court			1
it will be her first , and last , time playing college basketball			2
hope : instead of being scared of death , @entity5 ( above with mother @entity54 ) says she is just excited about getting to play basketball for her team just once @entity59 's basketball coach , @entity58 , said , ' she 's a special person			1
this girl is so strong , she 's dealing with death and all she 's thinking about is everyone else			0
her team first her family first , and just to give her that one last wish would be incredible for our program and our players			0
' as for @entity5 , those few weeks she has left wo n't be filled with fear or tears it seems , but rather excitement and hope			2
said the teenager , ' i love the roar of the crowd , the squeaking of the shoes			0
i ca n't wait to be on this court and wearing # 22			0
