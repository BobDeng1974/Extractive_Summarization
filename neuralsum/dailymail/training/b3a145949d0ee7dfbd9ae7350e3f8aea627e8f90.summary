by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:34 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 02:48 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 was accused of treating its tax obligations ‘ like the church collection plate ’ yesterday as the backlash against the coffee giant intensified			1
a cabinet minister weighed into the row over the chain ’s surprise deal with the taxman to pay a ‘ voluntary ’ £ 10million a year in tax			1
the agreement , revealed last week , followed weeks of damaging publicity about the @entity16 - owned company following revelations it had not paid any corporation tax in @entity20 for three years			0
anger : protesters gathered outside @entity2 on @entity23 in @entity24 yesterday to demonstrate against the coffee giant tough talk : @entity27 , chief secretary to the treasury , said on the @entity28 show that the government would clamp down on companies that dodge tax but critics are furious @entity33 have allowed the coffee giant to cut a deal with the taxman			1
mps said the unusual arrangement risked turning @entity20 ’s tax system into a ‘ farce ’			2
yesterday @entity27 , chief secretary to the treasury , insisted paying tax ‘ is not a voluntary choice ’ for corporations and insisted ‘ it is not something you can just chose to do willy - nilly because you think it will please your customers , it is an obligation ’			1
he insisted the government would get tough on firms such as @entity2 , @entity52 and @entity53 who structure their financial affairs to dodge tax			2
‘ thinking of the tax system as if it is like the church plate going around on a sunday morning is completely the wrong way to think about it , ’ he told the @entity57 ’s @entity28 programme			2
but @entity63 , the mayor of @entity24 , leapt to the coffee chain ’s defence – condemning the ‘ sneering ’ and saying it had a duty to shareholders to minimise the level of tax it pays within the law			1
huge pressure is mounting on @entity33 to close the loopholes which allow multinational firms such as @entity2 to avoid paying what is seen to be their fair share of tax			1
@entity79 last week announced a clampdown on tax avoidance by multinationals and the rich to plug a £ 32billion a year tax shortfall between what @entity33 is due and what it receives			0
his move followed a devastating report by mps which singled out @entity2 , @entity52 and @entity53 for paying extremely low tax rates by basing themselves abroad			1
@entity2 , based in @entity92 , has more than 700 outlets in the @entity20 , generating revenues of more than £ 3billion			0
under fire : the international coffee chain paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax in the @entity20 over the past 14 years but it paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the @entity20 and nothing in the last three			0
its £ 20million ‘ donation ’ has been widely branded a ‘ pr stunt ’ – and did nothing to stop protests by anti-tax avoidance demonstraters at more than 50 @entity2 coffee shops across the country at the weekend			1
but mr @entity63 defended the chain , saying it had a duty to pay the minimum tax it could , although he accepted @entity2 was in a ‘ hell of a mess ’			1
he said : ‘ imagine you are the corporate finance director of one of these companies			0
your job is to look at the law as it stands			0
your fiduciary duty to your shareholders is to minimise your tax exposure			0
’ veteran @entity123 backbencher @entity122 said the voluntary contribution from @entity2 was ‘ a farce ’ , adding it could lead to a form of ‘ democratic anarchy ’ after the public ‘ bullying ’ of the chain			1
@entity132 , a @entity133 activist said : ‘ it is an outrage that the government continues to choose to let multinationals like @entity2 dodge millions in tax			2
’ @entity138 was dragged into the tax row amid claims it avoids paying @entity20 corporation tax on more than £ 1.7billion of revenue			2
reports suggested a small office in @entity146 handles hundreds of millions of pounds of online sales in @entity20 and @entity148			0
the bulk of the money is then transferred to @entity138 ’s @entity148 hq in @entity152 – putting the cash out of the reach of the @entity20 taxman			0
@entity138 said it ‘ pays all due taxes ’ .			0

@entity27 , chief secretary to the treasury , said today paying tax ‘ is not a voluntary choice ’
