the woman , who is in her 30s , had warned @entity0 she was contemplating suicide after learning she was to be called to give evidence as a witness in a rape trial			1
she was concerned that some of her neighbours were involved in the case			0
the hearing listened to the recording of their conversation in which the doctor refused to give her a sick note excusing her from appearing in court unless she paid him privately			1
the @entity51 in @entity52 was told the incidents took place over two consultations in 2011 after the woman – known as @entity57 – registered with @entity0 ’s surgery			1
she had suffered various mental health issues and had initially gone to see @entity0 claiming her anti-depressant medication was not working and she was feeling suicidal			0
as she was leaving the surgery in @entity2 , @entity3 , she thought she heard the doctor urging her to commit suicide , saying : ‘ you should go home and kill yourself			1
’ she told the hearing : ‘ at the time i was feeling really depressed and it was n’t until i got home that i thought , i ’m sure he told me to go and kill myself when he patted me			0
’ a further consultation was booked in december 2011 after @entity57 was asked to give evidence in the rape trial and she decided to record the meeting in sceret			2

‘ i knew he had said it to me previously			0
i thought he might say it again			0
’ @entity0 is also accused of failing to include a reference to the woman ’s expression of suicidal intent in her patient notes and even added a false entry claiming she had threatened to kill him			1
@entity111 , for the @entity110 , said : ‘ quite clearly , if the doctor is found to have said these words to @entity57 , the @entity110 ’s case is that this would be an abrogation of his position of trust , present a danger to @entity57 because of her vulnerable position and undermine her trust in the profession			2
’ the hearing , which is expected to last five days , is going ahead in the doctor ’s absence after the panel heard he did not wish to take part			2

woman , known as @entity57 , *wanted* to avoid testifying in *forthcoming* trial
the patient visited dr @entity0 , 65 , at the surgery in @entity2 , @entity3
she recorded the appointment to show *police* how *scared* she was of court
tape was played to @entity51 hearing today
dr is heard to say she must pay for private sick note ; woman says she ca *n't*
when @entity57 said she would kill herself , he apparently says ' do it now '
doctor then heard saying : ' you *'re* not going to blackmail me saying that '
