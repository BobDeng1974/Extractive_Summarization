by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 14 november 2013 @entity1 officially unveiled its ‘ budget ’ @entity4 in @entity5 yesterday , with hopes of capturing the emerging markets			1
the £ 135 @entity4 is a 4.5 - inch handset running the latest version of @entity7 and will launch across @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and parts of @entity12 in the coming weeks			1
a notable omission in the rollout plans , however , is @entity15 - a region that @entity17 recently considered important enough to include in its @entity19 and @entity20 release , but one that has a chequered past with @entity1 's parent company , @entity23			1
it has a 4.5 - inch screen , @entity31 , runs on a @entity33 quad - core processor and comes with @entity34 built - in storage			1
it also has a @entity38 camera screen size : 4.5 - inch pixels - per - inch : 329 @entity41 camera : @entity38 rear - facing , @entity42 front - facing basic storage : @entity34 and @entity46 @entity48 @entity47 : £ 134.95 for @entity34 and £ 159 for @entity46 @entity49 : $ 179 for @entity34 and $ 199 for @entity46 speaking at the event , @entity1 's ceo @entity50 said : ' most people in the world ca n't afford a $ 500 or $ 600 phone			1
' the average price is close to $ 200 and the experience of these devices is really , really bad			0
' we think the industry should deliver more value , we think people deserve better			0
so that 's why today , we 're introducing @entity63 ' the firm chose @entity5 as the first country on its rollout schedule because the @entity68 region is seen as an important emerging market for smartphone makers			0
it is seen by many to be as significant as the emerging markets of @entity15			0
@entity17 certainly believes @entity15 is a lucrative country after the tech giant made its new @entity76 and @entity77 phones , as well as its new @entity78 , available in the region from launch for the first time ever			0
yet @entity23 , which bought @entity1 last year , has had previous run - ins with the @entity15 government over censorship concerns			1

it is seen by many to be as significant a region as @entity15 , yet @entity23 , which bought @entity1 last year , has had previous run - ins with the @entity15 government over censorship concerns			1
@entity15 heavily censors the web , across the country , and up until march 2010 @entity23 adhered to some of these laws			2
however , since then it has spoken out against the restrictions , and after talks with the @entity15 government broke down , @entity23 began redirecting people who visited its @entity15 site to its @entity101 service			2
a move that was criticised by the @entity15 government			0
the country and the company continue to disagree on the matter and its thought this rift may have been the reason why @entity15 was not included in the @entity4 plans			2

the @entity4 is set to be a cut - price alternative to the firm 's @entity122 handset , released in august , yet reports claim the firm has sold just half a million of these high - end phones meaning there 's a lot resting on the success of the @entity63 success that could be hindered further by the fact @entity1 wo n't be selling in @entity15			1
by comparison , rival @entity132 shipped more 10 million @entity135 in the same period			0
this may be due to the fact @entity1 ’s @entity122 is only available in the @entity138 , while @entity132 ’s model is available worldwide , yet the @entity122 is $ 100 cheaper than the $ 699.99 @entity140			1
when compared to these @entity122 prices , the £ 135 @entity4 is ‘ cheap ’ , yet there are other similarly priced smartphones on the market , including the @entity145 , the @entity146 and @entity148 ’s @entity147 with similar features			1
@entity1 's new £ 135 @entity4 handset is set to be a cut - price alternative to the firm 's @entity122 phone , pictured , released in august			1
however , reports claim the company has sold just half a million of these high - end phones meaning there 's a lot resting on the success of @entity4 the @entity122 's poor sales follow reports in the summer in which @entity1 announced losses of $ 342 million in just one quarter - a 34 per cent drop compared to same period in 2012			1
it has @entity167 , runs on a @entity33 quad - core processor and comes with either @entity34 or @entity46 of storage built in			0
the @entity4 has a curved back , designed to fit comfortably in the user 's hands , and the edge - to - edge display as seen on the @entity122 in what seems to be becoming a trend , the majority of the @entity4 's details were leaked before the announcement , including a post appearing on @entity179 earlier this week			2
the leaks revealed the size and price of the device , as well as hinted at the different coloured cases			0
the customisable colourful design of the @entity4 was originally seen on the @entity122 due to the @entity186			0
when customers in the @entity138 order the phone they can fully customise by choosing from a list of tones and colours			0
@entity1 initially said customers would be able to engrave their new @entity122 handsets , but this option was removed at launch			1
@entity4 goes on sale this week in @entity5 and parts of @entity9 and will be available within the next few weeks throughout @entity8 , @entity10 and parts of @entity12			2
it will be available in the @entity138 , @entity199 , the @entity200 and more of @entity12 in early january			0
@entity23 - owned @entity1 has also taken its lead from @entity17 by offering the @entity4 in a variety of colours , with interchangeable cases - or @entity1 shells , pictured			1
the customisable colourful design of the @entity4 was originally seen on the @entity122 due to the @entity186 the phone costs £ 134.95 for @entity34 and £ 159 for @entity46 in the @entity48			1
in the @entity138 , @entity4 will be sold for $ 179 with @entity34 of storage and $ 199 for @entity46			1
@entity208 , @entity209 at @entity210 , told @entity211 : ' the @entity4 offers plenty of bang for not many bucks - in fact , it ’s the cheapest quad - core device on the market			0
' it ’s ideal for someone looking for all the latest functionality without the wallet busting price tag associated with many smartphones and is likely to be a very popular gift this @entity224			0
' the @entity4 will be available from @entity210 from 11 december for £ 149 on @entity225			0
while @entity226 , telecoms expert at @entity227 added : '' rather than having to wait for hand - me - downs , a starting price of less than £ 135 could see the @entity4 become a great choice as a stocking filler as well as a great option for those wanting a device that wows and yet does n't break the bank			1
' the customisation aspect is another string to its bow for the emerging and modern markets alike , with a selection of appealing changeable covers available to lend a sense of style			0

@entity4 has a 4.5 - inch screen and costs £ 135 in the @entity48 and $ 179 in the @entity138
it is a budget alternative to the @entity122 handset released in august
