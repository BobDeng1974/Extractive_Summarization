' i was happy to know that i saved someone 's life			2
it happened at random and it 's an amazing feeling knowing you are able to help someone from thousands of miles away			2
' @entity37 knew the claims were serious ; she had been following the stranger 's @entity14 posts for about a year and had witnessed her receiving bullying messages from other users			2
' she blogged , saying she was going to end her life , ' @entity37 told @entity52			0

there is no other option "			0
' @entity37 immediately contacted a suicide hotline , but they told her to contact police , where she spoke with patrol officer @entity63 , a 14 - year veteran of the department			1
sleuth : a high school officer @entity66 used social media to help track down the girl 2,000 miles away all @entity37 could so was give the girl 's first name and a link to her blog			1
the only lead it gave to the girl 's identity was that she was a color guard at her school			1
' it was really nothing to start with , ' @entity63 said			0
' my first thought was to run [ the girl 's ] age and name through our local system ... and it came back with so many matches			1
' she contacted officer @entity66 , a school resource officer from @entity89 , in case the girl attended the school - but the officer did not recognize her			2
to be certain , @entity66 then sent the details to @entity96 assistant principal @entity95 , who also did nâ€™t recognize the girl - but who began her own web sleuthing			1
making the call : she contacted @entity11 police department , pictured , who began internet sleuthing along with local teachers - before they tracked down the girl 's last name ' we were kind of at a dead end , ' @entity66 said - until the assistant principal messaged her back to say she had found a @entity112 account matching the girl 's picture and that she had found her last name			1
' she sent me the link and i just went to town , ' @entity66 said			0
@entity66 trawled through @entity112 posts , @entity121 videos and online articles			0
she eventually came across a newspaper article mentioning a marching band that the girl had written about in one of her tweets			0
it said the band was in @entity23 , @entity24 - finally giving authorities a name and location			2
@entity66 called @entity63 , from the @entity11 police , who in turn handed the information to the @entity23 @entity137 at 1.30am			0
officers were sent to a nearby address and found the 16 - year - old girl , who was unconscious after swallowing a bottle of prescription pills			1
found ! she was discovered to be a high school student in @entity23 , @entity24 she was taken to hospital , lt. @entity145 confirmed			2

the women in @entity3 - @entity153 , @entity66 , @entity95 and @entity37 - said they were left speechless by the news			0
when @entity63 learned of the recovery , she got ' the chills ' , she said			0
