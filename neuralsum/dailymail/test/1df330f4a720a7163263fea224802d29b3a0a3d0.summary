@entity0 beats @entity1 to 2,000 @entity2 became the second - youngest @entity4 batsman to reach 2,000 @entity6 runs , after @entity7			1
@entity2 reached the milestone aged 24 years , 115 days			2
@entity7 was 401 days quicker			0
however , @entity2 did get there in fewer innings than @entity11 great @entity1			1
@entity2 's 182 not out took him past 2,000 runs in tests , the second fastest @entity14 to the milestone @entity16 joins fun thursday 's play finished with @entity20 ’ comedy salute to @entity4 ’s @entity21 after the batsman was dismissed following days of needling between the pair			1
cue outrage from some , indifference from others and a sprinkling of laughter thrown in			0
@entity16 ’s dad , @entity30 , saw the funny side , tweeting : ‘ @entity32 send off @entity20			1
live by the sword die by the sword , great stuff son			0
’ @entity20 gave @entity21 a salute send off after dismissing the @entity4 all - rounder @entity38 ca n't believe it @entity38 continues to search for a run in this test series and even a desperate appeal on friday could n’t help his cause			1
he tried to sweep @entity44 but only gloved it to give slip @entity46 a simple catch			0
‘ i think that goes up to @entity38 ’s no 1 worst - ever review , ’ said @entity49 on @entity51 ’s @entity50			1
@entity38 walks off after yet another failure with the bat , and an entirely wasted review @entity4 run - out woe you have to go back 113 years to find the last time @entity4 had three players run out in the first innings of a @entity6 — in january 1902 against @entity62 in @entity63			2
@entity4 are one short of the record of four run - outs in one innings though , which is shared by @entity11 and @entity62 — set in 1955 and 1969 respectively			0
@entity68 fails to make his ground despite a dive , as @entity4 suffered three run outs jet - setting @entity72 @entity4 coaches @entity73 and @entity75 plan to fly straight from @entity76 to @entity77 after the third test to make sure they are in charge for the first one - day international since the disastrous @entity81			2
the pair were expected to miss the match as it comes , oddly , just three days after the scheduled finish of this test series on may 5			2
but so keen are they to be present for the start of the new one - day era , the @entity4 pair will fly from @entity76 to @entity90 on may 6 , then straight on to @entity77 to take practice on may 7			0
@entity73 watches on , and will fly straight from @entity76 to @entity77 to make the odi against @entity93			0

@entity21 ' dad @entity30 tweets his *approval* of @entity20 ' salute
@entity2 moves to 2,000 test runs , faster than @entity1
@entity38 wastes another review , *branded* the worst of his *career*
