murder : @entity1 , shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997 , is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband			1
however , her boyfriend @entity22 , right , who actually did the deed , is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade monster meal : @entity1 , pictured above with a regular prison meal , requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals , cornbread , ice cream , and popcorn for her last meal she has also drawn attention to the fact that , while she did not kill her husband , the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023			1
if the bid fails , her lawyers are expected to ask the @entity92 to intervene			0

@entity1 's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency			1
but , her lawyers argue , the board did not hear from many @entity112 employees whose perspective ' would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case			0
' the most important witness the board did not hear from is @entity120 , who served as her warden for six years , first at @entity122 and then at @entity123			0
locked away : @entity1 , pictured above in 2004 , has been locked up for the past 17 years @entity120 could testify that former parole board chair @entity124 promised @entity1 would receive clemency , her lawyers wrote			2

@entity1 's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation			1
although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings , the reality is less clear , @entity1 's lawyers wrote			1
some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on @entity1 's behalf , but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden , who succeeded @entity120 last year			1

staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed , ' @entity150 wrote on jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution			0
@entity1 's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial , she had been offered the same plea deal as @entity22 - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years			1
' at one time , therefore , all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for ms. @entity1 , ' her lawyers wrote			2
@entity22 , who is the one who stabbed @entity23 to death , took the deal and testified for the prosecution			0
@entity1 balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer 's advice to go to trial			2
the parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants , her lawyers wrote			0

in statements submitted with her clemency application , @entity199 and @entity200 describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness ; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother			0
