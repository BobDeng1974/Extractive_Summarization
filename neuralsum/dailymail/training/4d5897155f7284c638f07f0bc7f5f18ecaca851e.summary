by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 3 november 2013 an artist has created a disgusting collection of work by making more than 50,000 flies vomit on his canvases			1
the revolting artwork is made by encouraging flies to throw - up sugar , water and watercolour paint			2
artist @entity11 , 35 , says he is taking advantage of flies ’ digestive system to create the paintings – the largest of which measure up to 6ft tall and 4ft wide			1
this painting was created by @entity11 who makes up to 55,000 flies vomit on his various canvases mr @entity11 takes advantage of the fact flies can not chew			1
instead , it must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly - digested material onto what it is about to consume			0
this liquidises the food and leaves ' flyspeck ' fly vomit art is a revolting idea , but mr @entity11 is not the first to disgust audiences by using animals for his work			1
in 1995 , @entity35 won a @entity36 in 1995 with a rotting cow ’s head			0
@entity39 has also profited from a gruesome idea , winning the prize in 1998 for a painting made with elephant dung			2
meanwhile , even the faeces , urine and blood of humans has also been used to create art in the past			2
perhaps most famously , singer @entity51 has in the past used his own blood to create a number of paintings			1
an exhibition of his work in 2008 featured a self - portrait , a gory illustration of his former girlfriend , @entity59 , and one of his needles			0
‘ i grew up catching snakes and looking at @entity65 books , ' he said			0
‘ as i developed as an artist , i became interested in how flies spread disease and how that could be used to create art. ‘ i knew that the disease spread through their digestive system , but i was n't sure how the biology worked			1
i found out more about it and discovered that during the process of eating , flies leave marks called ' flyspeck ' which is essentially their vomit			2
‘ i started experimenting with different ways to make paintings with this fly vomit			0
’ mr @entity11 takes advantage of the fact flies can not chew			1
instead , before it can eat , the insect must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly - digested material onto what it is about to consume			0
this liquidises the food , allowing the fly to suck it up , and leaving ' flyspeck ' - a small splash of fly vomit			0
mr @entity11 's method is to mix sugared water with watercolours to ensure the flies regurgitate sugary paint onto his canvasses			1
@entity105 generally only live for a month and each painting can take up to three months to complete - meaning several generations of flies work on one canvas			1
the largest paintings , which are 6ft tall and 4ft wide , are created by populations of up to 55,000 flies			1
@entity105 generally live for a month , meaning the disgusting paintings are created by several generations the paintings form a series entitled ' made in @entity117 ' mr @entity11 said : ‘ i buy maggots from a supplier - people usually buy maggots for fishing , or to feed their pets or for classroom experiments , but not me			1
‘ i make the canvases , then paint a background color to use as a base for the rest of the painting			1
‘ i stand two canvasses together , facing each other , and surround them with a screen			0
i then put maggots in the middle			0
the screen means that when they hatch , the flies ca n't get out			0
‘ once the maggots have pupated and are starting to hatch into flies , i mix paint and sugar and water , and let the flies get to work			0
’ mr @entity11 , of @entity117 , said the collection is representative of the city he said : ' when i started i fed the flies @entity149 's cheeseburgers and @entity150 , and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for @entity117 ' the largest paintings , which are 6ft tall and 4ft wide , are created by populations of up to 55,000 flies the paintings , which form a series entitled ' made in @entity117 ' , were produced for a project by @entity117 's prestigious @entity160 ( @entity160 )			1
a film of the series , shot by @entity163 and @entity164 for the @entity166 project , details the paintings which appear largely uniform from a distance but reveal amazing detail on closer inspection			0

he said : ‘ when i started i fed the flies @entity149 's cheeseburgers and @entity150 , and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for @entity117			2
‘ as i worked with the flies more , i liked how i could get them to create something beyond their nature - that i could get these nasty animals to create something transcendent			2
‘ flies are non-social insects , meaning they do n't make a hive like bees or a colony like ants			0
i have condensed them into a tight space unnaturally for them to make the paintings			0
‘ i am interested in “ base level alchemy ” - taking something base or mundane like flies , and turning it into something transcendent			0
