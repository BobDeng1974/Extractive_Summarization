by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 insists that his new plan will not lead to the reintroduction of full - blown rent controls @entity2 ’s flagship plan to impose 1970s - style rent controls was unravelling last night hours after it was launched			1

he said landlords would be forced to offer three - year tenancy agreements , with only modest rent increases permitted each year			1
@entity9 said the move would help the nine million who rent in the @entity20 and suggested it was backed by the respected @entity21			1
sources said the @entity21 would help @entity9 establish a ‘ benchmark ’ for capping annual rent rises			1
but , in an embarrassing setback , the @entity21 immediately distanced itself from the idea , saying : ‘ @entity28 caps are not a solution			2
’ it added : ‘ @entity21 is not developing proposals on rent benchmarks for the private sector , and we do not recommend that a government introduce a ceiling on rent increases			2
’ in a further blow it emerged that hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy - to - let investors could be excluded from the plans			2
@entity40 , from independent mortgage broker @entity41 , said the vast majority of buy - to - let mortgages specify maximum tenancy agreements of one year			1
labour sources confirmed that these landlords would be permitted to offer short tenancies ‘ where they are contractually obliged to do so ’			2

mr @entity2 has suffered a significant setback in his plan to control rents @entity9 also plans to ban letting agents from charging tenants upfront signing on fees of up to £ 500			1

’ @entity92 , of the free market @entity94 , described mr @entity2 ’s move as ‘ one of the worst policy decisions in the history of modern @entity20 politics ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity9 has unwittingly announced a policy that would devastate @entity20 ’s cities by creating massive slums and exacerbate the housing crisis			0
