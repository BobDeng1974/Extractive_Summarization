by @entity0 @entity1 is making ' unforced errors ' that are leaving @entity4 ' in difficulty ' , a senior mp warned last night			1
@entity7 , who was @entity4 's deputy chairman until last year , said mr @entity1 's controversial decision to pose for pictures holding a copy of the @entity12 newspaper last week was a ' serious mistake ' that had damaged the party , particularly on @entity15			1
he hit out at the @entity4 leaders aides , saying that members of the shadow cabinet were ' worried ' about the performance of the team paid to advise him , following a series of recent errors , such as failing to identify the @entity4 leader while campaigning in the town , and having embarrassing photographs taken while trying to eat a bacon sandwich			2
@entity7 mp has said @entity4 leader @entity1 is making ' unforced errors ' that are leaving the party ' in difficulty ' mr @entity1 , who boasted of standing up to @entity30 during the phone - hacking scandal , attempted to mend fences with the media mogul in the run - up to the next election by posing with a @entity37 souvenir edition of the @entity12 newspaper			1
he was forced to apologise for the decision less than 24 hours later following a ferocious backlash from his own mps , shadow ministers and activists , and the resignation of a councillor in @entity46 where many people still boycott the newspaper in protest at its coverage of the @entity51 disaster			1
former deputy prime minister @entity52 also criticised the decision â€“ and said mr @entity1 should take responsibility for it himself			1
he told @entity56 : ' i would n't do it , right , but the leader has to make a judgement about many things			2
his judgement was , on balance , to do what he did			0
no doubt advisers give advice , but you ca n't keep blaming advisers			0
labour leader @entity1 eats a bacon sandwich at @entity70 flower market in @entity71 ' at the end of the day , the leader must make a judgement , and he 'll be judged on his judgements			1
i would n't have done it			0
' but mr @entity7 said mr @entity1 's media advisers were making ' elementary blunders ' and should be sacked unless they can ' lift their game '			1
he told @entity83 @entity82 's @entity81 's politics show that the @entity4 leader was ' very badly advised ' to pose for the @entity12 picture			2
' it was his ultimate responsibility to do it but i just can not believe that the paper ended up his office and someone ended up taking a photograph of him and it ended up of the internet , ' he said			0
' the people around @entity1 , you know , they 're not civil servants			2
they are very powerful political people			0
they carry a lot of power in the @entity4			0
' a lot of @entity4 members raise funds to pay their very good salaries			0
and to make such elementary blunders like this - in the week that the @entity51 inquests were taking place - i think is a problem and i 'm sure there will be a lot of @entity110 members who are sort of holding their counsel on this but they are worried about the way @entity1 's office operates			1
' they 've either got to sort of lift their games or move on and get people who can do the job , in my view			0
