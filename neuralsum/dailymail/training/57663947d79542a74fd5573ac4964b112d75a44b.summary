by @entity0 @entity1 admitted for the first time on wednesday he was worried about his long - term future			1
@entity4 came up with a risque joke about @entity7 ’s football team that will no doubt leave a few over-sensitive souls feeling outraged			1
some preview days are nothing more than routine but that was certainly far from the case at the @entity13			1
let ’s start with @entity1 and an interview that was among the more revealing of his usually secretive career			1
on sunday at the @entity19 he walked off the course with just five holes to complete with a recurring back complaint			1
@entity23 faced : @entity1 in practice on wednesday ahead of the @entity13 at @entity25 @entity26 : @entity1 plays from a bunker ahead of his return to competitive action on thursday concern : the world no 1 is suffering with a recurring back injury with just a month to go until the masters the world no 1 and this week ’s defending champion is planning to play in the first round but will do so having hit nothing but the odd chip and putt at the totally revamped @entity25			1
woods first started experiencing spasms in his lower back last september			2
back then he was curt when asked whether there were any long - term implications but here he was more forthcoming			2
‘ a bad back is something that is no joke , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ when i ’ve had my injuries over the years , it always hurt after impact			0
so it ’s fine , the ball has gone , it ’s going to hurt like hell but i can do my job			0
‘ but with the back it ’s a totally different deal , and that ’s one of the things i ’ve learned about this type of injury			2
on sunday i could n’t twist and so could n’t make a backswing and when it ’s like that there ’s nothing you can do			0
so we ’re going to have a proper look at it and try to come up with something preventative but it ’s a fact i do n’t heal like i used to do			0
i watch my kids bounce right back up after they fall down and i think : ” hey , i used to do that			0
” ’ woods came up with a nice line about meeting up with his watching daughter @entity77 by the 13th green			0
‘ that was a very interesting concept trying to explain to a six - year - old why you ’ve just quit , ’ he said			2
in the swing : @entity4 hits a shot during a practice round prior to the @entity13 @entity85 : @entity86 stands in front of the @entity88 - where @entity4 is staying this week bouncing back : @entity4 blew a chance to win at the @entity19 with a poor back nine last sunday @entity1 was n’t the only one with problems during that amazing final round , of course			1
@entity4 threw away the event with a poor back nine but you ’d never have guessed from his ebullient mood			1
as for that line about @entity7 , he was asked whether he had ever employed a psychologist in light of @entity7 using one			1
after answering the question , a broad smile spread across his face			0
’ i think it ’s more than a psychologist that @entity7 need , ’ he said			1
in @entity108 in december last year , @entity4 got in a bit of bother with the internet trolls for replying , when asked whom he would be supporting in the forthcoming @entity113 series : ’ anyone but @entity7			1
’ perhaps anticipating the @entity116 reaction on this occasion , he added : ’ please do n’t print that			0
’ a bit late for that given the interview was broadcast live but it ’s worth repeating : it was a joke , people			2
@entity125 - ing good : @entity7 's former world no 1 @entity86 hits an iron during a practice session familiar face : open champion @entity130 is also teeing it up again this week in @entity133 @entity134 : @entity135 of @entity136 hones his short game in front of a lake showing off a cadillac it was n’t his only good one , either			1
some of the $ 250million @entity86 has spent on rebuilding this place has gone on naming the refurbished blocks of villas after legends of the game			0
would n’t you know it , @entity4 is staying in the … @entity1 villa			1
‘ there ’s pictures all over my room of him , ’ said @entity4 , laughing			2
‘ i sent him a message last night saying : “ i ca n’t get away from you			0
i ca n’t go to the bathroom without looking at you			0
” ’ travelling in style : @entity86 's helicopter was at @entity25 ahead of the @entity13 meet and greet : @entity1 and @entity86 shake hands on the eve of the @entity13 - @entity161 make yourself at home : ( from left ) @entity164 , @entity86 , @entity1 , @entity165 and @entity166 at the presentation of the key to the @entity88 - where @entity4 will be staying this week @entity4 admitted he was disappointed with the way he played down the stretch on sunday			1
‘ i was n’t as committed to my shots as i should have been but there were a lot of positives to take out of the week , ’ he insisted			0
‘ it was my third strokeplay tournament of the year and the third time i have been in contention so if you keep doing that you ’re going to eventually walk through the door and win , and then when you get into the habit of it , everything becomes a bit easier			2
’ amidst the flurry of mistakes @entity4 made coming home there was one truly outstanding blow on the 18th			2
when nothing else would do , he produced a stunning 240 yard five wood shot on that dangerous par - five that finished just 10 feet from the flag			0
‘ that might be the best shot i have ever played under pressure , ’ he said			0
it earned him a spot in the four man play - off but he could n’t capitalize , with @entity200 @entity199 snatching first prize			0
@entity1 ’s participation means the world ’s top 50 are all present here among this elite field of 69 players			1
with a first prize of a shade under £ 1million , any @entity209 victory will clearly have a huge bearing on the race for places at the @entity215 at @entity216 in september .			0
