by @entity0 it 's made headlines around the world - scandalised the @entity3 comments from you on this website			1
i am , of course , talking about @entity11 , a new sex talk chat show with a ' spectacularly ' quirky twist : three couples will have sex in a box on stage in front of a studio audience , then talk about it afterwards with a panel of experts ( i 'm one of them			1
) contrary to media hype , the box is n't see - through and made of glass or even ' opaque '			2
it 's made of wood			0
picture a @entity30 hut with a glossy , space age design and you 're on the right track			0
the box : @entity0 , flanked by @entity35 , left , and @entity36 , right , are the panel on @entity11 , which is hosted by @entity38 , front inside , it looks like a boutique hotel room			1
it 's soundproof with no cameras , so the couples ca n't be heard or seen once in there			2
not quite the ' live sex ' the media has led you to believe , eh ? no different , in fact , to what happens any time you book into a motel , share a flat with housemates or turn the key in the front door of your terraced home - people are having sex with only a wall separating you			1
yes , it 's a cheeky concept			0
everyone involved was braced for offence and outrage to be the initial reactions			0
but it 's done for a reason - to get people to watch a grown - up discussion about sex on mainstream tv			1
it had to be challenging to attract an audience			0
we want people to watch it			0
but whether you tune in to tut - tut or tune in to be educated ( the aim of the show ) , i guarantee if you stick with it for 10 minutes ( about the time it takes for the clunkiness of a new format to settle in ) , you wo n't just be pleasantly surprised , you 'll find it compelling viewing			1
here 's how it works : while each of the three couples are in the box ( with a 30 minute time limit ) , @entity94 , who hosts the show , international syndicated sex columnist @entity36 , psychotherapist @entity96 and me , discuss issues relating to the couple in the box			1
the couple : @entity101 and @entity102 , one of the couples to appear on @entity11 for example , when our first young couple are in the box , we talk about porn and the effect it has on a generation who have grown up with it			1
what can be done to keep female desire going long - term - with surprising insights - was a topic debated for our mature couple			0
just what gay men really get up to in bed , was the myth - busting eye - opening debate for the gay male couple			0
the premise : a couple have sex inside a large box in front of a live studio audience these discussions are tasteful , intelligent , warm and often funny			1
they are also educational , challenging harmful sexual myths that confuse and stop lots of people enjoying a healthy , enjoyable sex life			0
the discussions are so interesting , by the time the couple come out of the box , you 'll have forgotten they were in there ! when they do emerge - mostly loved up , a little tussled and glowing with a post-coital mix of ' i hope to @entity143 's not watching ' and ' this is cool - i 'm making history here and changing people 's attitudes to sex ' emotion - they join us for a chat about what they got up to in there			1
i 've never seen a more refreshingly honest , open conversation about what real people do in bed in my life - and i 've been studying sex and relationships for the last 25 years			0
what is it that makes it so extraordinary ? the very premise that 's causing all the ho - ha : the couples talk about sex immediately after they 've finished doing it			1
we got the idea from sex therapists and educators who sometimes get their clients to talk about sex immediately after they 've had it , so their thoughts and issues are fresh in their minds			0
i expected honesty and a little embarrassment			0
what i did n't expect was just how tender the couples would be once they came out of the box			2
it was incredibly sweet to watch them interact and remarkably inspiring			0
the point of @entity11 is n't just to educate , we 're hoping it will encourage couples to start their own conversations about their own sex lives			1
talk about what 's working and what is n't			0
the show will normalise sex for many people watching , surprise even more and hopefully leave all with a more realistic view of what really happens in bedrooms across @entity202 , rather than what pornography , movies or telly would have us believe			2
what do you have to lose by giving it a chance and tuning in ? @entity11 is on @entity209 on mondays at 10pm			1
it is part of @entity209 's @entity211			2
