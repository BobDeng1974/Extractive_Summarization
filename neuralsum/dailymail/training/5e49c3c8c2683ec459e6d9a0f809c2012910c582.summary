by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 10 april 2013 born in july 1908 , @entity1 has been gardening since the age of six and now dispenses his knowledge through @entity4 @entity1 is sitting in his well - worn armchair , @entity5 on his lap , scanning through the @entity4 page that he uses to share gardening tips with the public			1
a new question pings through : ‘ @entity11			1
what ’s a good plant for a north - facing garden ? ’ ‘ well , that ’s an easy one , ’ he says , peering through his spectacles			1
‘ the pyracantha , a shrub with red berries and sharp thorns , or even the cotoneaster , from central @entity22			1
or what ’s that other one ? it ’s name starts with an h			1
’ it ’s a rare memory slip but one that can easily be forgiven			1
for @entity11 , — born in july 1908 , is 104 years old			1
given that he planted his first flower — a @entity31 anemone — at the tender age of six , that means he has racked up a formidable 98 years ’ horticultural experience			1
and gardening , as evidenced by the success of television shows such as @entity37 , continues to be a thriving industry			1
so much so , in fact , that @entity11 is now dispensing his knowledge via the @entity4 page set up for him by a home and garden furniture centre			1
since # askralph was launched last week by the local branch of @entity47 , questions have been flooding in			1
these range from ‘ what are the easiest veg for young children to grow ? ’ — cress and lettuce , according to @entity11 — to ‘ when should you pull up potatoes ? ’			1
the answer : when flowering is over and the leaves start to go brown			1
one @entity4 user , @entity59 , asks : ‘ when should vegetables go in the ground this year , given how cold it is ? ’ in @entity11 ’s view , late april will be best			1
another , @entity64 , asks why her money plant is wilting ( it ’s probably due to overwatering )			1
others ask which plant @entity11 would like to see make a comeback — ‘ @entity71 stocks ’ — and what his favourite climber is : ‘ @entity74 , as it ’s very versatile and has beautiful flowers ’			1
to all these questions , @entity11 , a great - grandfather of six , seems to know the answers — and if he does n’t , he can soon find them in his well - thumbed ‘ bible ’ , @entity81 by @entity82 , his favourite reference book , first published in 1979			1
but despite his extensive knowledge , he modestly insists that he is no expert , merely a gardening - lover since childhood			1
his early years were spent mostly in @entity87 with his parents , @entity89 and @entity90 , and two younger siblings , @entity92 and @entity93			1
‘ we had a small east - facing garden			1
@entity96 grew roses and @entity98 grew huge marrows , ’ @entity11 recalls			1
‘ @entity100 began while we were young and @entity87 saw a lot of action			2
i used to hide under a table with a cushion over my head when the @entity107 zeppelins were expected			2
but whatever happened , we always had flowers in the garden			2
’ @entity11 is always able to find the answers to the questions which have been flooding in since his @entity4 page was set up last week after leaving school at 17 @entity11 became a bank clerk , but when @entity116 broke out he joined the @entity117 and moved to @entity118 , where he worked as an aviation candidate selector , interviewing potential pilots			1
in 1940 he married his sweetheart @entity121 , an accomplished piano player , and they started a family — @entity124 , now 63 , and @entity125 , 57			2
despite work , family commitments and a keen interest in sport — he played a round of golf and went canoeing at @entity132 in @entity133 on his 100th birthday — he always found time in the evenings and at weekends to garden			2
it was only in 1957 , though , when the family moved to the detached house in @entity139 where he still lives , that he could put down roots , both metaphorically and literally , and create the garden of his dreams			2
@entity1 and his great - granddaughter in his garden			1
the green - figured centenarian is said to be @entity147 's oldest gardener for decades , with @entity121 weeding by his side until her death in 2007 at the age of 94 , he has lovingly tended his 70ft garden			1
short of grape vines , which hold no interest for him , there is hardly any common planting he has n’t tried to grow — and he has views on them all			2
carrots and parsnips are the most difficult vegetables , he says			2
@entity161 is also tricky , as it does n’t germinate very quickly			2
but potatoes are easy , as too are onions , so long as the shoots are hidden under compost to hide them from birds			2
tomatoes are best grown in pots but geraniums — or pelargoniums , as @entity11 calls them , using the old - fashioned name — grow best in a trough			2
petunias need a lot of sunshine and do n’t like rain			2
sweet peas , on the other hand , needs lots of water			2
the techniques and tools ( spade , trowel and fork ) — that @entity11 uses are entirely traditional.the only big changes in his lifetime have been the introduction of specialist fertilisers and slug pellets — as a child , he used to peel off caterpillars by hand and stamp on any snails he found			2
he insists that there are no ‘ magic secrets ’ to gardening and that the most important ingredients are hard work and preparation			1
‘ people must de-stone the soil and sift it until it ’s crumbly before they even think about sowing seeds , ’ he says			2
‘ they must also weed constantly , especially at the beginning of the planting season			0
’ it was only in 1957 , when the family moved to the detached house in @entity139 where he still lives , that he could put down roots , both metaphorically and literally , and create the garden of his dreams @entity11 follows his own advice			0
his garden is bursting with daffodils and the flowerbeds are stocked with purple hyacinths , winter jasmine , beautiful climbing plants and a flowering evergreen hedge of @entity224			0
a plum tree and two apple trees , all rigorously pruned to provide bumper crops , stand proudly in mid-lawn			0
@entity1 as a baby with his mother in a garden but it is the roses that fill @entity11 with most pride			1
at the rear of his garden are some 200 floribunda and hybrid - tea bushes which in summer will produce flowers of many shades and a glorious scent			0
despite his age and a creaky left knee , @entity11 still does most of the work himself			1
he can still , with difficulty , plant potatoes , although he now uses a tall hoe for weeding and a grabbing tool for picking things up			0
his great - grandchildren help with dead - heading the roses and weeding , but only under his close supervision			0
this year it ’s been too cold to get out much			0
he is waiting until the end of the month to sow his onions and potatoes but does n’t mind the delay			0
‘ gardening is all about having something to look forward to , ’ he says			1
‘ it gets me through the winter			0
if i ’m ever depressed or lonely , i think to myself “ never mind , the roses will be along soon ”			0
it gives me the willpower to keep going			0
’ so too , it seems , does spreading the word on @entity4 , though he sometimes needs help from family members to type the replies			1
‘ i ’m not really into computers , ’ he says			0
‘ i only use my @entity5 for email , @entity4 and to place bets on horses			1
but if giving a bit of advice gets people into gardening , that can only be a good thing			1
they may all live past 100 then			0
as he walks steadily among the roses , leaning on his stick and breathing in the crisp , cold air , he says : ‘ a-ha ! i ’ve remembered the name of the plant that begins with @entity287 and is good for north - facing gardens			0
’ 1 pour boiling water on parsley seeds once they are in the soil			0
it helps them to germinate			0
2 planting marigolds with tomatoes will stop the tomatoes getting greenfly			0
3 surround small plants with crushed up seashells or spiky gravel to keep slugs away			0
4 if you have an unruly pampas grass , burn it down			0
the root will remain and regrow			0
5 if your plant is an iron - lover , put rusty nails in water for a while , then use this as a fertiliser			0
6 prepare your soil in the moonlight , as this discourages weed growth			0
seeds ca n’t germinate without sunlight			0
7 plants that spread rapidly , such as mint , can be contained by planting them in a long pipe , buried vertically			0
the roots have to go a long way down to spread			0
8 most plants like warmth , so water them with warm water			0
9 to keep cut flowers fresh for longer , put a penny in the vase			0
the copper helps to kill bacteria			0
10 @entity335 on your garden can be beneficial			0
the urea contains nitrogen , which soil bacteria convert to ammonia so it can be taken up by plants			0
peeing on tomato plants can apparently double their fruit production .			0
