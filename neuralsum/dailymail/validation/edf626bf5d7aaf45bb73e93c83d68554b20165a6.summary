@entity1 's plans for the @entity3 showdown with @entity4 have been undermined by yet another midfield injury – as @entity6 limped out of @entity7 ’ win at @entity9 on sunday			1
in the 58th minute of the @entity12 encounter , the 28 - year - old was contesting a high kick but landed awkwardly and his right leg bent backwards as home fly - half @entity15 landed on it			2
he was treated on the field before being helped off			0
initial indications were that @entity6 had suffered a medial ligament strain in his knee , but that early prognosis soon changed			2
@entity6 , hopeful of an @entity1 return against @entity4 , limped out of @entity7 ’ win at @entity9 on sunday @entity6 's injury after @entity15 landed on his leg initially seemed to be to his knee , but was to his ankle after his side ’s 26 - 17 comeback win , @entity7 ’ director of rugby , @entity28 , said : ‘ it seems to be his ankle			1
the knee seems to be okay			0
we ’re all hopeful it wo n’t be too serious			0
' it did n’t look very good and @entity6 has been unlucky this season			2
i ’m sure he ’ll be close to selection for @entity1 next weekend , so fingers crossed it ’s not as bad as it looked			0
’ @entity6 was due to join up with the rest of the @entity1 squad at their @entity44 on sunday night and he will face urgent medical assessments on monday , as the coaches wait to discover if he will be available for saturday ’s @entity48 clash with the @entity49 at @entity50			0
with @entity51 of @entity52 unable to train last week due to a calf strain , @entity6 was seemingly destined for a recall at inside centre , but now his hopes hang in the balance			1
@entity7 ’ director of rugby @entity28 is hoping @entity6 's injury is n't as bad as it looked @entity6 ( obscured by @entity15 ) was penalised for this challenge on @entity15 in the air that caused the injury @entity6 was due for a recall to the @entity1 side as @entity52 's @entity51 struggles with a calf strain the @entity65 was an heroic mainstay of @entity1 ’s autumn victory over @entity67 in his last @entity69 appearance , but a calf injury in that game kept him out for a month , then he damaged knee ligaments in his clubs ’ @entity75 tie against @entity76 in @entity77			1
that untimely setback meant @entity6 was unable to retain the national no 12 shirt , as he surely would have done if he had come through that pre-championship weekend unscathed			0
@entity80 , @entity1 ’s head coach , will hope that if @entity6 is n’t cleared for a return against @entity4 , @entity51 does recover in time			1
the alternative option would be to pick @entity83 at inside centre , but the @entity87 captain ’s form has been alarmingly inconsistent this season			0
if @entity6 is fit to play , he is set to rejoin the back line along with @entity91 full - back @entity90 – despite @entity93 ’s superb efforts at @entity94 yesterday			1
up front , @entity52 lock @entity95 is expected to come into the second row in place of @entity99			0
@entity1 coach @entity80 's plans for saturday 's @entity3 clash may have to be rethought @entity6 , here tackling @entity9 ' @entity102 , will undergo urgent medical examinations on monday @entity104 has recently recovered from calf and knee ligament injuries before the most recent blow			1

@entity6 was set to *replace* injured @entity51 against @entity4
@entity6 landed badly after challenging @entity9 ' @entity15 in the air
@entity7 centre suffered an ankle injury but is a chance of being fit
@entity7 boss @entity28 hopeful injury is ' not as bad as it looked '
