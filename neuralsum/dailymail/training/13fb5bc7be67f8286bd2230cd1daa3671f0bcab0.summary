by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 16:38 est , 16 february 2013 the previously unknown story of a compassionate @entity3 nurse who cared for wounded @entity4 despite her own brother dying on the battlefields has emerged for the first time			2
@entity8 was known about nurse @entity9 until a battered suitcase containing her mementos was discovered at the back of a cupboard at the @entity14 , in @entity15			1
researchers have been able to piece together bits and pieces of her life from photographs , her diary , letters , nursing certificates and an article she had written for a newspaper			1
serendipity : the battered case contained a trove of letters , photos and other mementos belonging to nurse @entity9 but academics at the university are at a loss to explain why the suitcase was hidden away in a cupboard at the university , especially since there is no record of her ever having been there			1
researchers are now trying to find the missing links to piece together the full story			1
inside the old case , there was an article @entity50 had written for a newspaper called @entity52 and an autograph book filled with sketches and thank you notes from @entity4 patients			2
thank you rhyme : a poem written in @entity60 's book , dated exactly one year after the end of @entity3 nursing life : inside the case there was a little black book with sketches and notes and an article she had written for a newspaper researchers have been slowly piecing together nurse @entity9 's life from the plethora of certificates , photographs , books , sketches , letters and articles inside the tatty case according to the diary she had reservations about treating enemy soldiers as her brother had been killed in action in the spring 1917			1
yet despite her misgivings the kind - hearted nurse is known to have tended to injured @entity4 prisoners of war during her time at the @entity91 , in @entity92 , as well as @entity94 soldiers at a hospital in @entity96			1
@entity97 , head of @entity14 's @entity98 , is keen to hear from anyone who can shed more light on @entity101			0
he said : ' the contents of this suitcase are absolutely fascinating , but we know very little about the person who owned it			0
there 's no record of her ever having been to @entity14 , so how it came to be in our possession is a complete mystery			0
friends , not foes : a letter from a soldier of war reveals how well thought of she was among her patients comic : a book of sketches and writings gives an insight into nurse @entity9 's light - hearted musings the team : nurses treated injured soldiers , @entity94 and @entity4 , at the hospital in @entity92 ' all we know about her is what we 've been able to piece together from the things we found in her suitcase			1
' it contains documents dating back to 1914 , including her diary and an article she wrote for a newspaper called @entity52			2
' there 's also an autograph book filled with detailed sketches drawn for her by her patients by way of thanks for the care she gave them , and a number of faded photographs of her and her fellow nurses dressed in their pristine white uniforms			2
' this is an important discovery as very little is known about nursing during @entity3 , at the time a relatively new profession , mr @entity97 said			0
@entity8 is known about nursing during @entity3 , at the time a relatively new profession ' she was desperate to do her bit for the war effort			0
so it came as a shock when she learnt she was to be sent to @entity91 to care for prisoners of war			2
' the fact that she managed to carry out her duties in spite of her misgivings , and that she did so in such a way that her patients went to the trouble of crafting gifts for her to show their appreciation , indicates that she was one of the best , ' he said			0
' nursing has always been about showing compassion without prejudice and nurse @entity9 showed an enormous depth of feeling to her patients under very difficult circumstances			1
' nurse @entity9 was part of the @entity185 @entity184 's @entity183 ( @entity186 ) was formed in 1902 , which replaced the @entity186 , formed in the 1850s to provide care to soldiers injured during the @entity191			1
the nurse was born in @entity193 in 1887 , she went to @entity194 and trained as a nurse at @entity196 - now the @entity197 in @entity96 - from 1914 to 1917			0
after the war she worked in the @entity199 in @entity96 , before doing further training at the @entity201 in 1919			0
she was sent a letter of appreciation for her service from the @entity205 when she finally retired after 52 years of service in 1969 aged 82			0
the university is now appealing for anyone with information on the heroic nurse to come forward			0
mr @entity97 said : ' if anyone knew @entity50 , or has any information about where the suitcase might have come from , i 'd be very keen to hear from them war effort : a note from another prisoner of war reveals how she touched the hearts of even the enemy piecing together the story : a photograph of @entity223 , taken from @entity224 , @entity225 , raises questions for researchers researchers could n't believe their luck when they opened the suitcase to find so many mementos from @entity3 ' she 's a fantastic example of what nursing is all about and it would be wonderful if any of her relations alive today could tell us more about her			2
' if anyone has any information they would like to share with @entity14 about @entity50 , please send an email to communications@abertay.ac.uk			0
