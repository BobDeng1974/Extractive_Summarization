by @entity0 , @entity1 the government unlawfully censored an embarrassing report about the controversial @entity6 rail project , it is claimed			1
@entity7 , the @entity8 , employed a special veto used in wartime to stop the release of a damning internal report about the planned @entity6 line			1
in an unprecedented move , @entity14 , the information commissioner , has announced that he will seek a judicial review of the veto			1
the government is set to face @entity21 challenges after ministers used a wartime veto to censor information about the controversial @entity6 high speed rail project mr @entity14 said he had ‘ not taken the decision lightly ’ , but added that it was a matter of principle since the censorship was ‘ unlawful ’			1
he said ministers had acted unreasonably because there was ‘ no demonstrable flaw in fact or law ’ in an earlier order to publish			2
in january , mr @entity7 used a rare emergency veto to ban publication of a @entity38 on the £ 50billion rail line			1
the information commissioner had ruled six months earlier that the findings must be published			0
but the government refused to comply – first appealing against the decision , then imposing the @entity45 campaigners accused the government of censorship			2
they suspect that the report undermines the case for the project and should be published in the public interest			0
it is believed to contain ‘ red / amber ’ warnings , which suggest the scheme could be in danger of failing			0
the information commissioner @entity14 and campaigners including @entity61 gp @entity59 have launched legal action , with mr @entity14 calling for a judicial review but ministers argued the report on the rail line , planned to connect @entity67 with @entity68 and the @entity69 , was confidential advice to them from civil servants			1
mr @entity14 has raised the stakes , announcing in a letter to sir @entity74 mp , the @entity75 chairman , that he will challenge the veto in the @entity21			2
transport secretary @entity7 told @entity77 he was imposing the veto on the report which labelled @entity6 in danger of failing mr @entity7 has insisted it was ‘ in the public interest ’ to block publication of the document			1
justifying his ‘ exceptional ’ decision , he said that protecting the impartiality of civil servants ’ advice to ministers must take precedence over disclosure to the public			0
but furious protesters said it was the first time the secrecy laws had been invoked since the @entity96			0
they branded the gagging order ‘ absolutely disgraceful ’ and said it was a ‘ delaying tactic ’ ahead of a parliamentary vote on @entity6			2
announcing his legal challenge , mr @entity14 said : ‘ the information in the @entity102 is all environmental information , and my decision notice of 6 june 2013 ( his earlier ruling on publication ) was issued in exercise of my obligations under the @entity110			1
‘ therefore under @entity113 law as it currently stands			0
the secretary of state ’s veto of my decision is unlawful			2
‘ the reasons given for the @entity6 veto do not amount to reasonable grounds , as they merely express disagreement with the reasons given in my decision			1
’ he added that he had taken into account a recent @entity125 decision that it was wrong for attorney general @entity127 to prevent the publication of 27 letters written by @entity130 to ministers			0
mr @entity127 used a veto to stop the letters – which were said to be lobbying on climate change – being published under a @entity136 request			0
that @entity125 judgment , which is still subject to appeal to the @entity138 , states that using the ministerial veto on environmental information is incompatible with @entity142 law			0
campaigner @entity143 , of @entity144 , said : ‘ so far as we can see , the last time secrecy laws of this nature were invoked was during the @entity149 war			0

@entity14 is launching a judicial review over censored report
@entity61 gp @entity155 is taking his own legal action
it comes after transport secretary @entity7 *overruled* @entity160 *'s* decision to publish a report stating @entity6 could fail
