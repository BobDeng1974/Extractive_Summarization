another student in @entity1 named @entity2 has been bombarded with hate messages and threats from people believing he is the racist fraternity member of the same name			1
he realized he had been mistakenly tied to the scandal when his roommate at @entity10 woke him up on monday to warn him of a barrage of hateful messages on his @entity14 and @entity15 accounts			1
at first he thought his accounts had been hacked , but he soon realized he had been mistaken for the racist student at arch rival @entity18			1
the other @entity2 , 19 , was expelled from the institution after he was caught singing : ' there will never be a n * * * * in @entity42 ' in a sickening video that has shocked the nation			1
the privately - educated @entity46 schoolboy from @entity47 was identified as one of the conductors leading the songs on a bus on saturday alongside 20 - year - old @entity52			1
the innocent @entity2 , who is studying towards his elementary @entity54 exams , told @entity55 he sees the funny side of what has happened , but admitted it had still been stressful			1
' initially , it was kind of scary , to not know what i did to bring all of this hate to myself , ' he told the station			0
' it 's definitely been stressful			2
but i guess i take a lighter view of the comments , and be happy it 's not directed at me			2
links : the innocent @entity2 ( left ) was wrongly targeted with the other @entity2 , a privately - educated @entity46 schoolboy from @entity47 was identified as one of the conductors leading racist chants on a bus he added : ' i do think it 's wrong			1
and it should n't be happening			0
and from the looks of it , we have a lot of work to do , if as a community we want to change that			0
' he also wrote a message on @entity15 saying : ' i would like everyone to know that i 'm not the @entity2 who allegedly was in the racist video from the @entity42 incident this past weekend			1
i am a student at @entity10 and have never had any involvement with this fraternity			1
' my @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity15 profiles have been linked across the internet in relation to this incident			0
i would appreciate it if people would stop posting slanderous and hateful messages on my pages			0
in the wake of his identification , the guilty @entity2 apologized and stated he had quit the university			2
even though other reports suggested he had been expelled			0
he wrote : ' i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night			0
it was wrong and reckless			0
i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same			0
' ' on monday , i withdrew from the university ... i admit it likely was fueled by alcohol consumed at the house before the bus trip , but that ’s not an excuse			0
response : the innocent @entity2 , who is currently studying towards his elementary @entity54 exams , admitted he sees the funny side of what has happened , but admitted it had still been stressful ' yes , the song was taught to us , but that too does n’t work as an explanation ... for me , this is a devastating lesson and i am seeking guidance on how i can learn from this and make sure it never happens again			1
' his family have since been forced to flee their home after protesters gathered outside and began chanting : ' racism is taught '			0
in response to the chant , which a whole busload of students joined in with , @entity42 's national leadership closed the fraternity			2
@entity2 is featured the most prominently in the video , as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics : ' there will never be a n * * * * * @entity42			1
you can hang him from a tree , but he 'll never sign with me			0
there will never be a n * * * * * @entity42			2
' the video , taken aboard a party bus saturday night en route from the campus in @entity154 to the @entity155 & @entity156 , caused immediate outrage on sunday when it was posed on social media			1
@entity10 officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight on monday .			2

the innocent @entity2 attends @entity10
he woke up monday to *hundreds* of *hurtful* comments on social media
they had mistaken him for the 19 - year - old racist @entity42 fraternity member

the other @entity2 at first thought his account had been hacked
but the student , who is studying @entity54 , admitted it had been stressful
