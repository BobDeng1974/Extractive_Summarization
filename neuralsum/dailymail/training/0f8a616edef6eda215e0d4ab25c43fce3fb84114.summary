by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity5 administration 's @entity3 scandal deepened on wednesday , with a whistle - blower from a @entity8 @entity7 saying the health system is run like ' an organized crime syndicate ' and a preliminary inspector general report declaring that veterans in @entity13 waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor			1
the @entity16 was rocked last month with allegations that 40 veterans died waiting for medical treatment at a health center in @entity13 , @entity21 because staffers manipulated the appointment system to delay care			1
the @entity25 reported wednesday that those delays appear systematic and ordinary – and endorsed by some in positions of power in the @entity16 health system			2
waiting and waiting and waiting : wounded and sick veterans are waiting an average of 115 days for care in the @entity34 , while a manipulated appointment system made it look like a 24 - day wait was typical disabled veterans make up a large contingent of those waiting for care at @entity16 hospitals in at least 26 states at the @entity45 's @entity44 , doctors debated now to back - date veterans ' ' requested ' appointment dates to make it look like published goals were being met @entity5 has been an occasional visitor at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			1
during this visit , he prayed with a veteran and his family members and the new interim inspector general report found that at least 1,700 veterans were denied spots on official waiting lists in @entity13 alone			1
and 84 per cent of them waited longer than the 14 - day limit that 's etched into published @entity16 guidelines			2
under @entity13 's phony reporting system , the 115 - day delays appeared to be only 24 days long			1
in @entity13 , administrators changed computer records so it would appear that doctors were seeing veterans soon enough to satisfy existing standards			2
meanwhile , they actually worked from a secret , off - the - books list			0
in @entity8 , the manipulation took the form of back - dating appointments and taking advantage of technicalities in published guidelines in order to avoid an overflow of patients			2
@entity16 guidelines dictate that veterans should be seen by a medical professional within 14 days of the ' desired date ' they request			1
@entity8 officials are accused of changing those desired dates in order to give schedulers more breathing room – and better employee performance reviews			2
the @entity25 suggested that the wrongdoing has been going on , unpunished , for years , raising doubts about whether any internal review of the agency would likely change the status quo			0
' for lack of a better term , you ’ve got an organized crime syndicate , ' a @entity8 @entity16 whistle - blower told the website 's reporter			1
' people up on top are suddenly afraid they may actually be prosecuted and they ’re pressuring the little guys down below to cover it all up			0
” ' i see it in the executives ' eyes , ' the whistle - blower added			1
' those performance reviews are key , since reporting subpar statistics means administrators ' wo n't stay a director very long and they certainly wo n’t get promoted , ' the whistle - blower said			1
' no one is getting rewarded for honesty			0
they pretty much have to lie , if they do n’t they wo n’t go anywhere			0
' some in @entity16 leadership appear to be conscientious enough to demand high standards			2
in one email chain published by @entity25 , a scheduling coordinator named @entity128 told @entity16 doctors statewide to change the ' desired date ' for some veterans ' care			1
the @entity8 va chief of staff , @entity134 , would hear none of it			0
' you can not do this ! ! ! ! this is essentially fraud , ' he replied			0
' the desired date is what it is and if we do n’t meet the standard then we will work to improve			0
' injuries you ca n't see : @entity148 retired sergeant @entity149 suffered a brain injury while serving as a military police officer in @entity152 , @entity153 -- when a truck drove through four road blocks striking him and killing two others under fire : @entity1 veterans affairs secretary @entity158 ( c ) is facing calls for his resignation over the @entity16 medical care scandal silence : president @entity5 did n't mention the @entity3 scandal at all on wednesday as he delivered the commencement address at the @entity165 at @entity165 @entity153 and @entity167 ceo @entity166 said the news could get far worse			1
' this newest case just further illustrates that the scandal is much more far reaching than most people realize , ' he said			0
' @entity13 was just the tip of the iceberg			0
scandal has become the new normal			0
' congressional republicans have responded to the crisis by demanding that va secretary @entity158 allow veterans to seek private medical care – with full reimbursement – if they wait more 30 days or more for treatment			1
@entity182 chair rep. @entity181 , a @entity184 @entity183 , said tuesday that he would soon introduce a bill to cement that demand into policy			0
' we simply ca n't afford to wait for the results of another investigation into a problem we already know exists , ' @entity181 said in a statement			1
' that 's why i 'm calling on @entity195 to take emergency steps			0
' a @entity16 spokesman responded in a statement that it was already redoubling its efforts nationwide			0
' @entity200 of our facilities is either enhancing their clinic capacity to help veterans get care sooner , or where we can not increase capacity , increasing the care we acquire in the community through @entity212 care , ' statement read			0
' @entity200 of our facilities is reaching out to veterans to coordinate the acceleration of their care			0
' one legislative proposal has already stalled in the @entity218 - controlled @entity217			0
the @entity219 passed in the @entity182 by a 390 - 33 margin but a @entity217 committee chaired by the socialist @entity223 sen. @entity222 has delayed considering it until june			0
the bill would give @entity226 and future @entity16 secretaries broad authority to remove administrators who are complicit in delaying or denying care to veterans			2
@entity8 @entity231 sen. @entity231 called for an @entity233 investigation on wednesday			0
wounded @entity153 war veteran @entity234 receives care from the @entity16 system , along with millions of other men and women who served in uniform @entity240 ( c ) , principal deputy undersecretary for health in the @entity219 , has taken over since former undersecretary dr. @entity241 resigned , and is sparring with @entity242 over subpoenas one good apple in a rotten barrel : dr. @entity134 ( r ) warned @entity16 doctors that back - dating ' requested ' appointment dates was ' fraud ' ' hundreds of our nation ’s heroes have disappeared from the appointment books and been denied medical care at the hands of scheming bureaucrats focused on their own financial gain , ' he said , ' instead of the health and well - being of @entity1 ’s veterans			1
' ' this is a sad day for our nation and the only fitting response in the short - term is for the president to direct the @entity233 to investigate these reports immediately			0
' the @entity16 's health care division could have trouble explaining its failures since records show it is flush with cash it has n't been spending			1
the @entity273 reported tuesday that the @entity16 will ' carry over ' about $ 450 million in medical care funding from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015			1
@entity158 was given $ 54.6 billion to work with overall this year – an annual allocation $ 10 billion higher than in the first full - year @entity5 budget			2
that year the agency shifted $ 1.449 billion in medical - care funding , money that it could n't spend , into the following year 's budget			1
even if veterans ' care improves dramatically , the @entity183 is already making hay out of the scandal			2
on wednesday the @entity285 launched a telephone ' robocall ' and @entity289 campaign declaring that president @entity5 is responsible for the @entity16 mess , and urging heavy turnout among @entity183 voters in november			2
the @entity183 is specifically tying the scandal to 10 vulnerable @entity295 members of @entity242 , hoping to flip their seats to the @entity183 column			1
for @entity16 administrators , avoiding patient backlogs and racking up a good rate of on - time medical care – whether records are accurate or not – can contribute by as much as 50 per cent to the performance - ratings scores that determine annual bonuses and career advancement .			1

*shocking* inspector general report found average wait times of 115 days in @entity13 , although manipulated waiting lists made it look like just 24 days
at least 1,700 veterans were denied spots on @entity16 medical appointment waiting lists in @entity13 alone
one @entity8 whistle - blower described his agency as a ' crime syndicate , ' with higher - ups engaged in cover - ups of medical care failures
@entity183 are demanding that the @entity16 give vets access to private doctors outside the @entity16 system if it ca n't provide care in 30 days or less
the @entity183 is already using the @entity16 scandal to target 10 vulnerable *democrats* in this year 's primary *elections*
