by mail online reporter published : 05:30 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 12:23 est , 7 march 2014 dream job : @entity3 , 31 , taste chocolate for a living at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the former chef admits he still gorges on chocolate even when his day shift is over this real life @entity11 might have the sweetest job ever – tasting chocolate for a living			1
@entity3 , 31 , from west @entity8 , is paid to eat chocolate			1
just like the eccentric character from @entity17 ’s @entity16 , mr @entity3 experiments with weird and wacky new flavours to make the next @entity21 's chocolate bar			1
but even though mr @entity3 can test up to five chocolate bars a day , the self - confessed chocoholic admits he still feasts on the sweet stuff when he gets home			1
mr @entity3 – whose favourite @entity21 's flavour is sea salt – is also forced to hit the gym five times a week to shift the extra calories			1
he also follows a strict diet to make sure he does n't put on weight – apart from the extra chocolate			0
mr @entity3 , who started work at the company in march 2013 , said : ' the most asked question is : ' do you get sick of chocolate ? ' and the answer is ' no '			1
‘ there are days when we are doing a big tasting session for three or four hours and there is a point where you need to stop , because you ca n’t have any more			0
‘ but even on those days , i get home and i might have another bar of chocolate			2
‘ it ’s one of those rare foods that no matter how much you eat you should n’t get sick of it			2
we have 19 different flavours in the range and i ’m not sick of any of them			2
’ as taste assistant for the company , mr @entity3 must taste - test every new bar			1
in the run - up to @entity60 , mr @entity3 is busy tasting luxury chocolate eggs and making sure each one is the correct shape and size			1
connoisseur : mr @entity3 spends his days cooking up chocolate concoctions in the kitchen ( left ) and then taste tests all the samples			1
he says chocolate tasting requires a good palette , just like wine tasting in a normal day , the former chef can either have a little nibble - or can take part in three - hour long tasting sessions			2
like a wine taster , mr @entity3 must be restrained - and hold back from eating the whole lot			1
he said : ' my friends and family do n’t believe it ’s a proper job			0
but they do n’t see the hard work and effort i put in			0
it takes up a lot of time			0
‘ i think they are all quite jealous but they ’re grateful they get a steady supply of chocolate when i go home			0
’ mr @entity3 also cooks up new ideas for flavours at the @entity21 ’s head office in @entity7 , @entity8			1
some of his less successful creations for the company include a tobacco - flavoured treat			0
but just like @entity11 , @entity3 takes pride in his chocolate tasting			2
he said : ‘ it ’s all left up to me to come up with the ideas and to go into the kitchen to see if they work			0
reflecting : mr @entity3 says he has to think carefully about which flavours might work - and says his tobacco - inspired treat was n't quite a hit ‘ i always encourage the rest of the team to get involved			1
you have to have a good palate to taste chocolate			0
you need to be able to take your time and describe flavours that you are getting			0
‘ i think when you are tasting chocolate , having a palate that is sensitive is good , as well as a good nose to get the aromas			0
’ mr @entity3 also says he is loyal to his own company - and only sometimes tucks into a @entity122 or a tub of @entity124			1
real life @entity11 : mr @entity3 's job can be compared to the likes of @entity11 from @entity17 's @entity16 , who came up with wacky recipes for sweet treats @entity3 began his course to the foodie ’s ultimate job when he took his first job as a chef aged 18			1
he cooked in various hotels and restaurants , on a yacht in @entity139 and at a ski resort in @entity141			0
he later moved into product development for supermarkets , where he created new recipes for cakes and other sweet items			0
chocoholic : mr @entity3 says he still loves all 19 of the company 's flavours but his favourite is sea salt to clinch his role at @entity6 , mr @entity3 sat through rigorous rounds of chocolate taste tests – similar to wine tasting			1
but his taste for chocolate meant he beat 3,000 applicants to the job			2
he said : ' i ’ve always been a foodie and i ’m passionate about different cuisines and flavours and making flavours come together			0
' i do think it ’s the best job in the world			0
with any creative job , it ’s putting that hard work and effort in and seeing that product on the shelf - that ’s where the satisfaction comes from			2
' @entity21 ’s was set up in 1991 by husband and wife @entity176 and @entity178			2
‘ @entity182 ’ represents the ethical sourcing of the cocoa beans and ‘ blacks ’ reflects the intensity of the chocolate .			0

@entity3 , 31 , has dream job as real life @entity11
the @entity8 eats the bars as taste assistant at @entity21 's
but the self - confessed chocoholic says he still eats more at home
mr @entity3 said : ' it 's one of those rare foods you never get sick of '
