she has dominated the airwaves during 30 years as a chart - topper , but now @entity3 has decided that @entity4 is an immaterial girl and just too old for its teenage listeners			1
despite her determined efforts to look – and sound – youthful , the 56 - year - old has been dropped from the station ’s playlist that determines which songs are played by @entity12 during the day			1
@entity4 ’s latest song is living for love and has been available for airplay since december 20 last year			1
but that was after 7pm , when songs not on the playlist can be broadcast			0
the track is the first single from the mother of four ’s new album , @entity30			0
the station last night said the single had been omitted from playlists on the basis of ‘ audience relevance ’ and ‘ musical merit ’			2
a @entity3 insider said : ‘ at the end of the day it ’s all about relevance			2
it ’s natural that as an artist gets older their audience goes elsewhere and @entity3 has to reflect that			2
‘ the station has a duty to meet the needs of younger listeners			2
i do n’t think the audience is losing sleep that it is not playing @entity4 in the same way that it used to			0
’ the snub represents a remarkable fall from grace for the star who notched up 13 @entity57 no 1s between 1985 and 2008			0
she finds herself alongside sir @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 on a long list of artists who struggle to get new material played on the station			0
sir @entity59 , left , and @entity62 also struggle to get their music played on @entity69 @entity4 ’s single is being played on @entity71 , which caters for an audience aged over 35			1
by contrast , sir @entity74 ’s new single will be played by @entity3 even though the former @entity76 is 72			1
this is because the track is a collaboration with rapper @entity80 , 37 , and pop mega-star @entity81 , 26			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ tracks are chosen on musical merit , and while around 40 per cent of the country ’s 15 to 29 - year - olds tune into @entity3 each week , an artist ’s age is never a factor			1
’ @entity4 ’s spokesman declined to comment .			0
