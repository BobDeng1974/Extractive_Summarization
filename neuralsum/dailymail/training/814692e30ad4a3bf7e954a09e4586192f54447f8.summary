the source said : ‘ he ’s telling everyone , “ we ’ve got to get rid of all this green crap			1
” he ’s absolutely focused on it			0
’ @entity14 high command has also privately abandoned mr @entity2 ’s pre-election mantra ‘ vote blue , go green ’			1

and he even applied to put a wind turbine on the roof of his family home			0
but although he still pays lip service to the need to tackle climate change , his enthusiasm for green issues waned as the government battled the economic crisis			0
in september , chancellor @entity105 said @entity106 should not be ‘ in front of the rest of the world ’ on tackling climate change			0
and the government has driven through radical planning reforms to boost the economy , which critics claim could lead to the concreting over of large parts of the @entity116			0

using the government ’s own promises as a yardstick , these findings show he ’s failed to stick to his plan			0
’ - prime minister @entity2 @entity38 said today the prime minister had not abandoned his commitment to the environment			1
' he has been quite clear about rolling back the impact of levies on energy bills , but only last week in @entity171 he was talking about the importance of tackling climate change , ' said the @entity44 source			0
mr @entity2 made clear during that @entity171 visit that he believed the evidence of global warming was ' growing ' and thought it was right to take ' preventative and mitigating steps ' in response			2
