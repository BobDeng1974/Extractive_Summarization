@entity1 manager @entity0 believes his side can not expect to just defend deep and look to hit @entity3 on the counter-attack if they are to secure safe passage into the semi-finals of the @entity7 on monday night			1
the @entity8 head to @entity9 on the back of a fine run in the @entity12 , with sevens win in the last eight games putting them third , now a point ahead of @entity3			1
the last time @entity0 took his side to @entity19 at the end of january , they produced what many believe was a pivotal defensive - minded display to beat @entity23 2 - 0			2
@entity24 battles for the ball with @entity26 as @entity1 trained ahead of their trip to @entity9 for monday night 's cup tie @entity0 is confident his team can beat @entity3 by playing attacking football as they seek to defend their title @entity32 holds off @entity33 as @entity1 trained on sunday at their @entity35 training ground to prepare for @entity9 @entity36 lets fly with a shot , as @entity0 promised his team would attack against @entity39 's @entity3 side @entity0 says his side wo n't try and sit deep when they face @entity3 on monday night , despite the recent success of that tactic @entity0 , though , maintains a concentrated rear - guard action alone will not be enough to see off @entity39 's side , who continue to grind out results despite a wave of criticism over their style of play			1
' at @entity23 , we scored the first goal , then we were on a defensive foot because they had to come out , and that ( who scores first on monday night ) is not predictable today ( before the game ) , ' said @entity0			1
' but what is for sure is both teams will go for it , so that means we will have to attack well and defend well			0
' @entity1 won against @entity23 despite having only 35 per cent possession			0
@entity0 knows it is more about what you do when you have the ball than how long you keep hold of it			0
the @entity8 squad are put through their paces as they look to reach @entity70 for the third time in two years @entity72 , whose return to the club from loan has coincided with @entity1 's good form , runs with the ball during training @entity1 's @entity79 winning playmaker @entity78 has been in top form since returning from injury , and has never lost an @entity7 game @entity84 forward @entity83 , who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against @entity86 , prepares for his first trip to @entity9 ' you have to analyse it			1
you also have to look at ways of possession - is it in your own half or is it in the opponents half ? if it is in your half , it can be a bit illusionary possession , ' said the @entity1 boss			2
' i still think possession is an important part of the game - you can not go into a game and say you do not want the ball			0
' sometimes you do not have the ball because your opponent is better , sometimes you are leading 1 - 0 or 2 - 0 and your team is focused on defending the advantage			0
@entity109 goes for a sprint during the sunday - morning training session at the @entity8 ' @entity113 base @entity72 , playing with a mask after breaking his nose in last weekend 's win over @entity118 at the @entity119 , stretches out per @entity123 , whose place in the @entity1 team was in doubt before an injury to @entity126 , gestures to his team - mates during the session @entity130 attempts to control the ball as @entity32 , @entity123 and @entity109 watch , as the @entity8 players enjoyed themselves in training @entity135 puts in the effort with a sprint as @entity139 ' team got ready for the vital game at @entity9 @entity1 's highly - rated @entity142 17 - year - old @entity141 trained with the first team ahead of the @entity7 quarter - final ' but overall i still think it is very important that the sport rewards people and teams who take initiative			1
' despite the inconvenient kick - off time for the final televised @entity7 quarter - final , @entity1 expect some 9,000 supporters to make the journey to the north - west			2
