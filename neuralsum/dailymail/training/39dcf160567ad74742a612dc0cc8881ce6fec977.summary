by @entity1 reporter published : 10:48 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 28 february 2013 while most children enjoy nothing more than playing outside on a warm summer 's day , seven - year - old @entity2 dreads it - because she can not sweat			1
after just minutes in the sun in her native @entity8 , the young girl becomes over-heated and dizzy , and must instead be confined indoors , where she takes 33 daily medications for her condition			1
her parents have spoken about the everyday struggles of her illness as thursday marks @entity15 , which was established by the @entity16 in 2009			0
@entity2 suffers from a rare genetic disorder called cystinosis , which prevents her from sweating and causes other problems , such as kidney failure , rickets , muscle wasting and stunted growth			1
' it was her first real , live outside summer , ' her mother , @entity34 , told @entity36			0
' she just stayed in the water for three months			0
' but many other parts of her day are not so easy ; she takes 33 pills , one injection of growth hormone , 14 eye drops to prevent blindness and seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach			1
@entity49 , a medication she takes six times a day , including in the middle of the night , makes her breath stink , and the smell even seeps through her pores , her mother said			2
by the time she is a teenager , she will need 80 pills every day , and she will also require a kidney transplant by the time she is 15			1
struggle : every day as she battles cystinosis , @entity2 must take 33 pills , one injection of growth hormone and eye drops and she eats seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach support : her father , @entity67 , is the president of @entity68 , which helps families with children with the condition her illness also means she rarely manages a whole week at school , but her parents told the @entity75 that the support of @entity2 's teachers has been phenomenal			1
her teacher even suggested they speak to the class about @entity2 's condition , mrs @entity2 said			1
@entity2 suffers from @entity82 , a rare genetic metabolic disorder			1
it causes an amino acid , cystine , to accumulate in every cell of the body , damaging organs and blood cells			0
because of this defect in transportation of the amino acid , the cell crystallizes and causes early cell death			0
@entity82 slowly destroys the organs in the body including the kidneys , liver , eyes , muscles and the brain			0
common symptoms include kidney failure , mineral depletion , small stature , rickets , malnourishment , frequent urination , muscle wasting , and cysteine crystals in the corneas			0
it is an autosomal recessive genetic disease , which means that both parents are carriers of the gene that leads to this condition			1
the parents do not exhibit any of the symptoms and the odds are that one - in - four of their children will have cystinosis			2
@entity2 is the only one out of four siblings with the condition			1
she is one of 500 americans with the condition , according to the @entity68			2
an estimated 2,000 people suffer from the illness worldwide			1
she is also one of at least 25 million @entity124 who suffer from rare conditions , according to the @entity129			1
' [ the children ] thought @entity2 was a hero to be able to swallow 33 pills a day , ' she said			1
' and now , they look out for her , they baby her , and they have embraced her because of the difference			0
' it was an excellent call from an excellent teacher			0
' @entity2 also catches up with school work during summer recesses , as she is unable to go outside in the @entity8 sun without becoming ill. the reason she is unable to sweat is just ' one of those mysteries of cystinosis ' , her mother said			1
she was diagnosed with the condition at 15 months old			2
her parents , who have three older children , knew something was wrong when she stopped growing and needed to drink two gallons of water every day , and they sought out professional help			2
' being she was my fourth , i knew something was wrong , ' mrs @entity2 told @entity36			2
' @entity2 was very , very tiny at this point because she had stopped growing			2
i went from doctor to doctor until i found one that believed me			0
' they came across one doctor who was treating another patient with the same condition , and @entity2 was diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis , the most severe form			1
' her prognosis is unknown , ' mrs @entity2 told the @entity75			2
' technically , cystinosis is considered terminal because there is no cure			2
@entity67 and i do n't like to think that way			0
so , we just go with the idea that there â€™s no expiration date stamped on her anywhere			0
' each month the family spends around $ 5,000 on medication , doctors ' visits and supplies , most of which is currently covered by insurance			0
taking it in her stride : @entity2 told her classmates about her condition during a presentation at school and now they all rally around her to help , her parents said but they are also battling for new medication for their daughter which will make her life easier			1
a company is expected to get @entity200 approval for a new drug over the next few months that could replace @entity49 , and which would last for 12 hours instead of six , her parents said			0
the family also went to @entity203 last month to speak with their representatives in @entity205 and ask them not to cut funding to research programs as sequester budget cuts loom			0
among their requests , they argued to keep funding for the @entity212 of 1983 , which gives pharmaceutical companies tax incentives and other help so that they research rare illnesses			0
they also argued for a @entity219 policy known as @entity220 , in which middle - class families in 26 states get federal dollars to help pay for the costs of caring for a child with serious illnesses .			0

@entity2 must take 33 pills every day for her condition
she suffers from a rare genetic disorder called cystinosis , which *affects* 500 people in the @entity124 and 2,000 people worldwide
