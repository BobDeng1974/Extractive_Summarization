@entity0 is both one of the most famous and most controversial photographers in the fashion industry			1
known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him			1
and this week he faced accusations from the model @entity8 that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission			1
in the one - minute - long film , which played a huge part in @entity24 's rise to fame , and which was uploaded to @entity32 two years ago , @entity24 is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption			1
@entity37 writes in @entity25 : ' @entity0 found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in may 2012 , when he uploaded his now infamous video of @entity41 in a teeny - weeny bikini doing the @entity20 , a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding , " paws " aloft			1
' the video received millions of hits on @entity32 - not to mention a number of slow - motion versions for the more discerning customer - but , at the time , @entity41 was horrified because the behind - the - scenes video had been filmed for fun , not something she expected would make the final cut			1
' @entity0 has worked with @entity56 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) shooting them in his @entity60 studio @entity0 sat front row at the @entity63 fashion show in september 2013 alongside @entity64 when asked about the situation @entity24 said : ' i was like , " that was disrespectful , you could have told me ! ''			1
' but @entity41 also adds that there 's no bad blood over the @entity32 video anymore			1
' now , obviously , it 's fine			0
' however this is not the first time that the 49 - year - old photographer who has shot everyone from @entity56 to @entity57 in his @entity60 studio has faced controversy			1
in fact , to say @entity81 's reputation precedes him would be an understatement			0
he is the man who the @entity83 once referred to as ' fashion 's shameful secret '			0
known to many as ' @entity0 , ' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be @entity90 whilst he is dressed as a horse			1
further sexual shots show @entity0 completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths			1
@entity0 is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world , he is pictured here heading into the @entity105 @entity104 's party indeed it 's been more than ten years since @entity0 first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour			2
in 2004 an intern named ' @entity110 ' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled ' slut ' , something which the @entity0 described at the time as , ' it 's @entity116 ! ' then in 2009 , a model called @entity118 claimed that @entity0 's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob , apparently telling her : ' @entity118 , can you grab his c * * * and twist it real hard ? he likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it			1
' in 2010 a model named @entity131 confronted @entity0 at a party in @entity133 after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in @entity138 , models under the age of 18 are considered underage			1
she said : ' he takes girls who are young , manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of			0
' they are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves			0
' @entity0 poses with @entity149 ( left ) and @entity150 ( right ) doing his signature thumbs up pose @entity0 is good friends with @entity154 who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in @entity60 in 2010 furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against @entity0			1
one model named @entity160 revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions			2
@entity160 said that the second time she had her period and @entity0 asked ' to take my tampon out for him to play with			2
" i love tampons ! " he said , in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what 's fun for @entity0 is fun for them			2
' she refers to the fact that @entity0 wanted to make ' @entity177 tea , ' with her used sanitary product			2
@entity160 revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by @entity0 but by his team after he took all of his clothes off			1
@entity0 once told the observer of his shoots : ' a lot of it starts with me saying to a girl , " do you want to do nudes ? " and they 're like , " i do n't want to be naked "			2
' so i say , " i 'll be naked and you take the pictures			0
you can have the camera			0
you can have the phallus "			0
' despite the allegations which have been levied against him @entity0 remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with @entity200 and @entity201 last year model @entity202 spoke to @entity204 about working with @entity0 and said : ' you are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for @entity206 , whose one of his clients			1
' that 's a legitimate job , and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors			0
' i have spoken with other models who have been in these situations , and he makes you feel like you 're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it 's all cool			0
' she also revealed that there is a , ' ring of silence , ' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers			0
@entity0 rarely responds to the allegations levied against him , but in march 2014 - after a model posted a piece on @entity234 including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for @entity238			1
@entity239 claimed that during her shoot @entity0 became aggressive and it ' became sexual act after sexual act			1
' @entity0 poses with @entity245 sisters @entity133 ( left ) and @entity246 ( right ) at the opening of his @entity249 exhibition in 2012 in the letter , posted by the @entity138 gossip website , @entity0 said that the accusations were ' false , ' ' hate filled libelous tales			2
' he said : ' enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the @entity257 , people have become comfortable concocting hate - filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives			0
' in writing this , i make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors , because i have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation , all that remain are the lies			0
' he said : ' i have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do			0
' i give everyone that i work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly , and as such , it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history			0
' the model @entity290 has previously defended @entity0 saying : ' he just exudes this sexual energy , so he does n't need to ask girls to take off their clothes			1
honestly , they just do it			0
' @entity0 poses with troubled actress @entity296 @entity0 's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him			2
these include shopping giants @entity301 and @entity302 and brands such as @entity25 , the @entity304 and @entity305			0
the model @entity306 said in 2010 : ' i 've shot with [ @entity0 ] , but i did n't feel comfortable and i wo n't do it again			1
' however @entity0 remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of @entity64 and @entity149			2
and he still works with the likes of @entity206 and brands such as @entity314 and @entity315			0
designer @entity316 once defended @entity0 as being , ' not ill - spirited			1
' @entity0 's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician			1
he got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for @entity323			0
since then he has enjoyed a stint living in @entity325 working for publications such as @entity327 and @entity328 but now shoots mainly from his studio in @entity60			0
the photographer has also directly music videos in his time			0
one of the most controversial was for @entity154			0
@entity0 shot the video for @entity334 a collaboration between @entity154 and @entity336 last year , however , the project was later scrapped			2
@entity338 later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the @entity342 was , ' literally an ad for rape			0
