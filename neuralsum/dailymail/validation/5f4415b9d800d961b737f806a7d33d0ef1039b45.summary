officials were left red - faced after @entity5 's foreign minister @entity9 received the gift from @entity1 's @entity11 at the end of a news conference marking 135 years of diplomatic relations			1
but what was immediately apparent was that the map on the brochure , filled with the colors of the @entity5 flag , was that of @entity7 , not @entity5			1
@entity5 foreign minister @entity9 and his @entity1 counterpart @entity11 exchange the gift unaware it shows a map of @entity7 filled with the colors of the @entity5 flag mr @entity9 unwittingly holds the brochure aloft after it was given to him by the @entity1 government pictures show the two ministers grinning and posing for photos as mr @entity9 receives the gift unaware the obvious error is being displayed to the world			1

' @entity1 also said mr @entity9 had responded diplomatically , claiming he had n't noticed the mistake			0
immediately following the mix - up , @entity1 's @entity36 apologized , saying it had received the brochure in the morning containing the error from national news agency @entity41			2
its statement read : ' due to a regrettable technical error , exclusively on the cover of the booklet , the border of the maps of @entity1 and @entity7 - with the latter being covered by the @entity5 flag - was printed			2
' the @entity1 foreign minister has directly conveyed profound regret for this situation to his @entity5 counterpart			2
' new agency @entity41 later apologized to both the @entity5 and @entity1 foreign ministries for the mix - up , as did the printing company			0
it is the second time in just over a month that @entity1 's foreign ministry has had to apologise for a mistake			0
