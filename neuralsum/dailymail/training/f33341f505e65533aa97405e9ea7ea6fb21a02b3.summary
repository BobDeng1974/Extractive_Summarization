by @entity1 reporter published : 14:43 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 15:26 est , 13 january 2014 television shows focusing on teenage pregnancies and young mothers have helped lessen the number of high school girls who become pregnant , according to a new study			1
' @entity9 ' and ' @entity10 ' have long been derided as allegedly glamorizing teenage pregnancies , but a new analysis that compared the decreasing birth rate by young mothers and television ratings now shows that the programs may have caused teens to think twice about having unprotected sex			1
researchers at @entity20 have concluded that the rate of teen births dropped by 5.7 per cent during the time that the shows were on the air from june 2009 to late 2010			1
warning sign : @entity26 is one of the 47 teenage moms that have been featured in the @entity29 shows @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity31 which are now being noted as bringing down the birth rate by the numbers : the television shows are cited by teenagers as reasons why they think before having sex all told , that could mean as many as 20,000 births were avoided as a direct or indirect result of the show			1
' this can explain around one - third of the total decline in teen births over that period , ' researchers @entity42 and @entity44 wrote			2
while a host of factors could have had a combined impact on the birth rate drop , the researchers were convinced that the show definitely brought down the number of abortions among teens			1
' this suggests that the shows ’ impact is attributable to a reduction in pregnancy rather than greater use of abortion , ' the study states			2
the @entity66 noted that the latest drop is just one in a pattern which has gone on since the 2008 recession , but analysts are still giving credit to the show			0
' it ’s thrilling , ' @entity74 to prevent @entity77 and @entity76 chief executive @entity75 told @entity79			0
cautionary : @entity81 has a son @entity82 and is now pregnant with her second child after suffering a miscarriage			0
she has a history of violent outbursts , having been arrested ten times in the past three years downward trend : the show , coupled with the recession and increased health education , have been cited as reasons for a decreasing number of teen births ' people just do n’t understand how influential media is in the lives of young people			2
' the latest national figures cited by the paper state that 29 out of every 1,000 @entity103 girls give birth before their 20th birthday			0
that figure shows a drop from the 2007 finding of 42 out of every 1,000 girls			0
critics of the show , which first started as @entity10 and then spun off with @entity9 and later @entity31 , as an inappropriate way to glamorize the lives of these young mothers and their volatile relationships with the children 's fathers			0
one of the clearest examples of the perils of the fame given to the young mothers is the case of former @entity9 subject @entity121 , who starred in and later released a sex tape with porn star @entity124			0
glamorizing ? @entity121 went from being featured in the show with her daughter to organizing her own sex tape release , a decision which she later said ' ruined my life ' after initially teasing that she made six figures on the tape , she has since revealed that she only got paid $ 10,00 by selling the video and said that it ' ruined my life '			0
the researchers described how the show creators were purposefully showed the difficulties facing new mothers - citing how one mother spent a month in the hospital and how another child had to be airlifted to a hospital for emergency treatment			1
' overall , the realities of the lives of teen mothers are presented in ways that may have been unknown or difficult to imagine for other teens viewing the show , ' they wrote in the study .			1

a new study *claims* that the @entity29 reality *series* helped bring the teen birth rate down to 5.7 per cent
critics say the show glamorizes teen pregnancy but researchers argue that the difficulties are seen as warning signs by viewers
