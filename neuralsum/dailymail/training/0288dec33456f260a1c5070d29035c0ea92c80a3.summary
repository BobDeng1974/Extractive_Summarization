broadcaster sir @entity0 last night said sir @entity1 is the victim of a ' witch hunt ' and criticised the way the @entity4 covered the raids on his house			1
the 79 - year - old 's comments come as sources close to the singer claim he is becoming more and more upset with the way the investigation is being handled after the search of his @entity14 home was beamed live around the world by the @entity4 on thursday			1
speaking on @entity18 , the former @entity4 journalist said : ' i just think that it 's wrong			1
i think anybody not charged should not be named by the police			2
' i think the @entity4 did create an error in judgment , not in understanding the story and having the story and trying to follow it through			2
it was the manner in which they chose to actually cover the event – if you can call it an event			2
' it has also been reported that three more celebrities are being targeted by police investigating historic sex offences			2
the @entity60 claims two tv stars and a musician who lives abroad for tax reasons are under scrutiny			0
sir @entity1 , 73 , has been left ' completely in the dark ' by detectives investigating claims of historic child abuse , it emerged last night			1
@entity26 has said detectives want to speak to the 73 - year - old over an allegation of sexual abuse on a boy under 16 at a @entity77 rally in 1985			0
sir @entity1 , with his friend @entity78 , has not been asked for an interview by @entity26 nor even been contacted by them despite police publicly stating they want to speak to the star , he has yet to be contacted since the search			1
sources close to sir @entity1 said he did not want to ' start a war of words ' over the handling of his case but is understood to be growing increasingly upset with his treatment			1
the latest development came as stars , politicians and a policing standards body spoke out against the way the case had been handled			2
amid farcical scenes , sir @entity1 has been left in ' cruel limbo ' since police swooped on his £ 3million @entity14 home in front of @entity4 cameras as he holidayed in @entity102			1
but the singer has yet to hear from police , has not been formally approached for interview and knows nothing of the allegation – nor who his accuser is , his spokesman said			0
a spokeswoman from @entity26 said : ' we are not releasing any information on speaking to the owner of the property			0
that would form part of the investigation and we would n't comment			0
' sir @entity1 , who has dismissed the allegations as ' completely false ' , is currently at his home in the @entity121 yesterday sir @entity1 enjoyed tennis in the sunshine as an extraordinary row erupted over the @entity4 's coverage of the police raid			1
a source close to the star , who has dismissed the allegations as ' completely false ' , said : ' he has been left completely in the dark about what is happening			0
' there has been no formal request for an interview and no phone call from police since this all started on thursday			0
' smiling and apparently relaxed , sir @entity1 appeared in good spirits as he also enjoyed a dinner party with friends at his @entity121 vineyard			1
meanwhile in @entity143 , chief constable @entity142 faced blistering criticism over the force 's handling of the case			1
former attorney general @entity148 suggested the force may have contravened police guidelines which say suspects should not be named before being charged unless doing so serves a ' policing purpose ' such as protecting the public			0
he said : ' they have not arrested him or charged him			0
all they have done is carry out a search of his house so why have they notified the @entity4 so it could film this taking place ? it is very questionable			2
' @entity161 , chairman of the @entity162 home affairs select committee , is writing to the chief constable to demand an explanation			0
crusade : sir @entity1 and @entity168 at an evangelical rally in @entity170 in 1984 former shadow home secretary @entity171 added : ' the extraordinary decision by the leadership of @entity143 police to allow the searching of sir @entity1 's house to be televised , like some morally challenged reality tv show , demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of @entity183 's police and justice system			1
' investigative journalist and former detective @entity184 , the first to receive the allegations in 2012 when the alleged victim contacted him after his documentary exposing @entity189 , said : ' i am very disappointed at how @entity26 have handled the investigation			0
' meanwhile , @entity143 has written an official letter of complaint to director - general lord @entity194 amid suggestions detectives were virtually blackmailed into cooperating with the broadcaster			1
the force said it reluctantly agreed to ' work with ' the @entity4 after being contacted weeks ago by a reporter who had found out about the investigation			2
critical : former shadow home secretary @entity171 and former attorney general @entity148 have both spoken out against @entity26 ' it was agreed the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts ' , it said in a statement			0
' the force was reluctant to cooperate but felt to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence			0
the broadcasters appear to have contravened editorial guidelines			0
' police also called for an inquiry into how the leak reached the @entity4			1
the @entity218 , the professional body that sets standards , said if the leak to the @entity4 was an unauthorised police disclosure it would contravene the code of ethics			1
the college 's chief executive , chief constable @entity225 , said : ' the presence of a @entity4 film crew at the scene of a police search , usually a closely guarded secret , has attracted understandable attention			1
' top human rights barrister @entity233 accused officers of ' treating @entity1 as though he were a bank robber or a mass murderer ' then leaving the star in ' cruel limbo '			1
@entity26 and crime commissioner @entity238 also launched a probe			0
his spokesman said : ' questions need to be answered as to the original source of the leak , which put the force in a difficult position when approached by the media			0
' yesterday the @entity4 said : ' the @entity4 agreed to follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that might jeopardise a police inquiry			2
