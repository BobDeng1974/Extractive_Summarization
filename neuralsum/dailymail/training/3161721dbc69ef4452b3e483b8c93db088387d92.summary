by @entity0 last updated at 6:20 pm on 28th june 2011 lawyers in @entity2 are preparing a groundbreaking court case aimed at stripping diplomats of immunity from prosecution			1
human rights lawyers hope the case against a @entity10 diplomat accused of beating an employee will be the catalyst to be able to bring prosecutions against foreign embassy staff worldwide			1
the @entity15 this week published a 60 - page study on the reported widespread humiliation , exploitation and abuse of private domestic servants employed by diplomats in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity2			2
widespread : the @entity27 in @entity28			2
a @entity2 study has revealed widespread humiliation , exploitation and abuse of private staff by diplomats in six @entity36 countries the @entity22 had 51 cases of abuse reported between april 2009 and march 2010			2
many of those involved people who had come to the @entity22 through people traffickers			2
some 70 per cent of those employed by diplomats said in a survey , conducted by the @entity44 in @entity22 , that their passports were confiscated and they were paid and treated like ' slaves '			2
@entity24 had 50 cases in 2009 - although only four were referred to authorities - while @entity26 was worst in the list with 62			2
the report mirrors another published in the @entity52 yesterday , which put @entity22 on the ' top tier ' of abuse of diplomatic employees			0
the landmark court case in @entity2 concerns a 30 - year - old woman who claims she endured daily beatings with a stick for 18 months at the hands of a diplomat from the @entity10 embassy in @entity28			1
she said she was kicked and ' humiliated like a serf '			0
' top tier of abuse ' : the @entity67 and @entity68 embassies in @entity69			0
@entity22 had 51 reported incidents of abuse between april 2009 and march 2010			0
there is no indication the incidents took place at these embassies unable to speak @entity2 and with no money , the @entity77 native was a prisoner of her employer			1
eventually , a @entity28 group that aids trafficked women from all over the world took her to safety			0
diplomatic immunity is laid down in the @entity86 of 1961 and makes embassy employees unanswerable to the laws governing the rest of society			0
the worst thing that can happen is expulsion back to their homeland			0
@entity96 lawyer @entity95 and the @entity15 are now financing the court case which could give the right to legal redress against diplomats who exploit their staff			1
he said : ' human rights are , also from the perspective of international law , a higher good than diplomatic immunity			0
' the woman was sent by an agency in @entity108 to work at a home in the @entity110 before transferring her to @entity10			1
in april 2009 , she accompanied her @entity10 employer to @entity2 were he was to serve as an attache at the embassy , according to the @entity2 news magazine @entity115			0
her duties included caring for the wheelchair - bound wife of the diplomat and his four daughters - including putting on their shoes each day , even though the eldest was 17 and the youngest 12			1
she worked from 7am until gone midnight every day , slept on the floor and never had a single day off in the entire time she worked for the family			1
she told of being punched , of the stick beatings and of how her employer encouraged his five - year - old son to hit her			0
an earlier court hearing rejected claims of slavery because of the diplomatic status of the alleged abuser			1
the next step is a hearing at the state court , followed by the constitutional court			0
@entity115 said : ' the fact that a case of modern slavery was brought before a court is already extraordinary in its own right			1
' no one checks to see if members of the diplomatic corps obey the regulations regarding working hours and wages that have been in force for the past eight years			1
it would , after all , violate the principle of immunity			0
' the legal firm representing the @entity10 embassy dismissed the allegations made by the woman , who has since returned to @entity77 , as ' baseless ' .			1

@entity77 forced to work 18 hours a day serves as test case
@entity158 had rejected *initial* slavery charge because of status
