by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 07:28 est , 12 april 2012 it 's a system straight from the @entity3 blockbuster @entity4			1
police in downtown @entity6 are fighting crime by predicting offences - before they have even happened			2
unlike the usual method of responding to 911 calls , cops use computers which show them ' red spots ' where an incident is most likely to occur			1
they are then deployed onto the streets in a bid to deter thugs , burglers and gangsters from going on their next crime spree			2
technical : @entity22 cops study an enormous computer screen showing ' red spots ' where the next crime is most likely to committed the ' predictive policing ' system pulls together crime statistics and pinpoints the areas where most offences are being carried out			1
police are then sent to patrol those streets the programme has some similarities with the hit science fiction film @entity4			0
the movie is set in 2054 and a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes			0
however , unlike @entity22 's system who use computer data , those in minority report employ special psychics called ' precogs '			1
@entity48 plays ' @entity50 ' captain @entity49 but the system eventually predicts that he will commit a future murder and he has to take flight			1
such disturbing situations are unlikely to happen with @entity22 's system , which uses crime statistics - and not premonitions - to pinpoint the next likely incident			1
the system has been trialled in the @entity60 division of downtown @entity6 since november and could be rolled out to other areas if it is successful the ' predictive policing ' system being used in the @entity65 of downtown @entity6 has been developed from the same kind of mathematical calculations used to predict earthquakes and aftershocks			1
it analyses the times , dates , and places of recent crimes such as burglaries , break - ins , and car thefts			2
it also looks at the frequency of offences and predicts how many are likely to be carried out if the trend continues			0
if a spate of crimes have happened in one area , or a crook appears to be moving across the region , this is flagged up the software			0
the data is then aggregated and ' hot spots ' are formed			2
capt. @entity90 says the system is able to put police on the streets before crimes have happened			2
futuristic : @entity48 , left , as @entity49 in the science fiction hit @entity4 , which uses psychic ' precogs ' to predict future crimes complex : @entity49 uses his special powers to predict crime to map future offenders on a giant computer screen			1
the premonitions backfired when he was himself accused of a future murder ' sixty - five percent of our crimes are burglary , grand theft auto and burglary from a motor vehicle			0
and that 's what these boxes represent , ' he told @entity115			0
@entity117 police chief @entity116 said the main goal was to prevent crime			0
since the system was introduced burglaries are down 33 per cent and violent crime is also down 21 per cent			1
@entity123 said : ' i love catching people - it 's what i live for - but what i 'd rather do is live in a place and work in a place where crime did n't happen			0
' everybody thinks they do their profession as well as it can be done and so they do n't need any help			0
if this old street cop can change the way that he thinks about these things , then i know my kids can do the same			0
' he added that the system helps police to use their officers more effectively			1
it has been tested in the @entity65 since last november and if it is found to be successful it could be roled out across more divisions in @entity6 .			0

@entity3 blockbuster *starring* @entity48 uses psychics ' prediction
@entity22 system uses crime stats on computers to send officers to ' red spots '
burglaries down 33 per cent and violent crime down 21 per cent since introduction last november
