by @entity0 a patent application filed by @entity2 has revealed that its long - mooted @entity3 could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			1
the innovative design , published for the first time today , reveals the technologies that could one day be seen in an @entity2 wearable computer			1
it comes after tidal waves of rumours and speculation on exactly what an @entity3 might be like , including a range of designers revealing their take on the ' smart watch ' - but none managed to predict what has emerged			2
a @entity26 patent in february detailing @entity2 's plans for an @entity3 followed an earlier application to the @entity29 in 2011			1
this image , taken from the @entity32 patent application describes a ' wearable accessory device ' which mounts a touchscreen on the user 's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap @entity32 patent application no. 20130044215 , filed by @entity2 in august 2011 , specifies the technology for a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display '			1
it describes : ' a wearable video device ... comprising : a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled state [ and ] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate			0
' the wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach to users ' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy			2
@entity2 's latest patent application suggests the company is pushing forward with its plans to launch what 's been dubbed the @entity3			1
a patent image , pictured , shows what the strap could look like popular among youngsters in the late @entity65 and early - @entity66 , slap wraps are bracelets consisting of layered , flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a fabric or plastic cover			1
the bracelet can be straightened out , causing tension within the springy metal bands , then slapped against a wearer 's forearm , causing the bands to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist			1
as expected by many @entity2 observers , the @entity3 - like device described in the ' 44215 patent app would be ' configured to display information wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device ' , most likely an @entity84			1
as well as the touch - sensitive display , the application says it would include ' a communication link , allowing two - way communication between the slap bracelet and the portable electronic device			2
' ' information generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device display or the flexible display , ' the application says			0
some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered			0
' the battery can take many forms , ' it suggests			0
' for example , the battery can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory			0
' it also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			1
' ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application says			2
accessory : the device would sync wirelessly with @entity2 's @entity84 to provide a second screen for users to read messages from and input data to their mobiles the patent application has emerged after a tidal wave of speculation suggesting how the @entity3 could look			1
@entity2 has not made a single comment about the rumoured new product , but designers have nevertheless rushed revealed their take the ' smart watch ' with professional looking mockups of the device , ranging from a glass cuff to a ' claw ' design			0
the rumours started when @entity146 websites reported in december that the computer giant is working with chip - maker @entity148 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it is was claimed it would have a 1.5in screen and use @entity153 to communicate with other devices , which could include an @entity84			0
@entity156 's translucent concept of how the @entity3 might look has proved to be misguided , if @entity2 does indeed base their gadget on the technology in their latest patent application the emergence of the ' 44215 patent app today appeared to back up some of those claims			1
' active communication between an accessory and a portable electronic device can be accomplished wirelessly , ' it says			0
' a wireless data connection such as the 5 ghz 802.11n protocol can provide sufficient data transmission bandwidth to transmit a high quality video stream			0
' alternatively , ' the accessory device could also connect to the portable electronic device via @entity153			0
' while it might not carry the same amount of data it may be preferable for situations in which only small amounts of data are being sent back and forth			0
' @entity2 has a team of about 100 product designers working on the wristwatch - type device , a report in @entity181 claimed .			2

patent application 20130044215 , published today , reveals @entity2 's technology for a ' wearable accessory device '
it would include a flexible touchscreen led to display messages from and input data to an @entity84 or @entity194
it comes after a tidal wave of speculation as to what an @entity3 could look like - but no accurate predictions as to what @entity2 has come up with
@entity3 would ' snap ' into place around the wearer 's wrist using the same bi-stable spring bands as are used in @entity208 toys
@entity2 also reveals innovative plans for powering the device , including solar panels and wristwatch like ' kinetic ' technology
