@entity8 , 55 , was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2003 and was told he would have to make a choice between his face or his life			1
after speaking with his wife , @entity14 , mr @entity8 made the agonising decision to go ahead with the surgery which left him without a nose , upper lip , or palate			1
but now the former carpenter , from @entity21 , has been able to kiss his wife for the first time in a decade after having a new face fitted , and says he now wants to take her out to dinner			1
warning graphic content @entity8 , 55 , says he is able to go out for the first time in a decade after being fitted with a new face following surgery which saw his nose , upper lip and palate removed after being given his upper lip back mr @entity8 says he has been able to kiss his wife for the first time in a decade and is looking forward to taking her out for a meal in 2003 mr @entity8 was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer growing in his jaw which meant he had to choose between losing his life or his face he said : ‘ if you ’ve ever had a bad dream that is what it is like , except you do n’t wake up ‘ i would have to chew by pushing my fingers down on my bottom teeth which meant i was too embarrassed to dine out			1
‘ kids would look at me sometimes , they ’d look at me with fear then they 'd run back to their mothers			2
i looked like a monster			0
‘ now it ’s incredible , @entity14 and i can go out in public and for the first time in years people do n’t look or point			0
‘ i can take her out to dinner and on dates i no longer feel like i need to be a recluse			0
’ mr @entity8 said at one point he was considering letting the cancer kill him because he could n't bare the thought of life after the surgery , but his wife @entity14 ( pictured ) refused to let him die mr @entity8 wearing his first prosthetic face which was designed by a man who made disguises for the @entity70			1
however , shortly after it was fitted it became infected and had to be removed mr @entity8 , a father - of - three , married @entity14 in 2000 , six years after separating from his first wife			1
but just two years later , he started to notice unusual pains in his teeth			0
then , one night as he tucked into his favourite meal of steak and chips he felt a worrying pain in his mouth			0
‘ i told @entity14 it felt like my teeth were coming loose , ’ he said			2
‘ it was really painful			0
’ the next day mr @entity8 saw a dentist who referred him to a doctor who thought it was simply a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics			1
despite the increasing pain and his teeth growing looser every day , a further 14 doctors gave the same diagnosis			2
it was only after a horrifying discovery in the spring of 2003 that mr @entity8 , from @entity21 , @entity92 , was sent to a specialist who could tell him what was really wrong			1
mrs @entity95 said : ‘ i knew it was something serious as @entity8 's pain got worse and worse			1
mr @entity8 has since had further operations he has now been fitted with new teeth , upper lip and nose as part of his new prosthetic , mr @entity8 had to have a metal cage fitted to his face in order to hold his nose , cheeks and lip in place ‘ he could no longer eat dinner because it was so painful for him to chew			1
' then one morning i heard a cry from the bathroom			0
@entity8 was calling for me , he needed help			1
‘ his nose , which had been looking increasingly rashy , had become red raw			0
as he touched it with his finger blood and puss started pouring out			0
mr @entity8 said that after his operation he caught sight of himself in an x-ray machine and thought it was a ghost until he realised it was his own reflection ‘ he put his fingers inside and a huge lump of bloody flesh popped out and landed in the sink			1
the smell was horrific - like rotting meat			0
we were both in tears			0
‘ i 'd had enough			0
we were going to demand to see a specialist who would get to the bottom of this			0
’ mr and mrs @entity95 made their way to @entity139 where mr @entity8 was finally given a biopsy			1
his wife said : ‘ the news was devastating			0
the doctor said @entity8 had this aggressive cancer and if he did n't have loads of his face removed he would certainly die a terrible , painful death			1
‘ the cancer was so rare there have only been 26 recorded cases worldwide and it 's more likely a person will be hit by lightning than get it			1
‘ i sat in shock as @entity8 and the doctor shared a laugh about how @entity8 had survived being hit by lightning twice - so he was n't that surprised with the news			1
‘ still we were both devastated , though it was at least a relief to know what was going on			0
‘ the doctor told us most of the face would have to go			1
he said “ the cancer has gone right into the bone			2
we may need to take the nose , the mouth , teeth and both the eyes too ”			0
’ mr @entity8 was in shock but only had a short time to make his decision			1
‘ i hit rock bottom , ’ he said			0
‘ i was only 49 but i would never properly kiss my wife again			0
i 'd never chew another meal , may not be able to talk , sing , work or even see			0
‘ i was n't sure if life after surgery would even be worth living			2
i thought about just letting the cancer kill me			2
‘ but i knew @entity14 would n't allow it			0
and i could n't leave her on her own			0
i knew i had to do what i could to survive this			0
’ @entity95 ( left ) who married @entity8 in 2000 , says he first complained of his teeth feeling loose before blood and pus started pouring from his nose one morning after seeing a specialist , mr @entity8 was diagnosed with an ameloblastic carcinoma , a rare type of cancer that grows in the jaw			1
to date , only around 30 cases have been reported worldwide mr @entity8 is pictured at home with a swollen nose			2
doctors initially thought he was suffering from a sinus infection , before he was diagnosed with cancer in august 2003 mr @entity8 underwent a 12 - hour operation to remove three tumours that were threatening his life			1
he was given just a two per cent chance of surviving			0
amazingly , the operation was a success but when mr @entity8 woke from the anaesthetic and saw his reflection he was horrified			2
ameloblastic carcinomas are rare , cancerous tumours			2
they usually develop from the jaw			2
symptoms usually include pain in the jaw and swelling around the jaw area			2
to date , only about 30 cases have been reported worldwide			0
the tumours tend to grow aggressively in the face but do not often spread to other organs			2
treatment usually involves surgery and , sometimes , radiotherapy			2
source : radiation oncology he said : ‘ i woke up in a blur and looked around			0
the good news was i still had my eyes and had n't lost my vision			0
‘ the bad news was i looked hideous			0
i caught a glimpse of myself on a shiny part of an x-ray machine as i lay there and i actually pushed myself back as i was laying down , thinking i had seen a ghost or a monster			0
then i realised it was me			0
over the next six years mr @entity8 had to have another 35 operations to stabilise his face			1
he sometimes wore a dust mask in public to hide the hole and it broke his heart when he saw little children run to their parents in fear after seeing him			2
mr @entity8 became increasingly reclusive , so @entity14 found a prosthetic expert who used to make disguises for @entity70 agents and got him to design a new face for @entity8			1
however , just a few weeks after having the face fitted , mr @entity8 contracted a bacterial infection which threatened to kill him a second time as it was so close to his brain			1
luckily , after two weeks in intensive care , he beat the infection , but it left him back at square one , living with the large gap in his face			1
however , thanks to a new series of operations including fitting a metal cage to his face to hold the prosthetic in place , mr @entity8 has a new face			1
@entity8 's story appears in a new series of @entity266 , september 11 , 9pm on @entity267 mr @entity8 pictured with parts of his old prosthetic face			1
after the old prosthetic caused his face to become infected , mr @entity8 nearly died a second time but recovered after days in intensive care mr @entity8 said he used to wear a dust mask over his face in order to go out			1
but after children ran away from him in the street and shop workers made hurtful comments , he became a recluse			2

@entity8 , 55 , diagnosed with rare cancer growing in his jaw in 2003
told he could save his face or his life before *deciding* to have surgery
@entity288 left him with hole in his face so had to have a prosthetic made
after first new face was made he got infection so have to have it removed
now second face has been fitted he says he feels able to go outside again
