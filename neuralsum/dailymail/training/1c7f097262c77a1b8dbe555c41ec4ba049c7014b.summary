a devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ ease her suffering ’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain			1
retired @entity8 ’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive , lake - front home last tuesday , but his wife of 62 years @entity10 has vanished , in a suspected kidnapping			1
investigators in @entity14 , @entity15 are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple			0
nothing was taken from their $ 1m home , their car keys and cellphones were left behind			1
their son , @entity30 , said : ' if she is still alive , we ca n’t imagine what she is going through … but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father , just to ease her suffering ' mystery : no - one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm @entity10 and @entity8			1
nothing was taken , their cellphones and car keys were left behind			1
police have ruled out a mob hit and that @entity8 was in witness protection			1
and their family they ca n't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son , @entity52 , in 2000 the police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple 's son 's in a drug deal gone wrong			1
officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues , but as yet the local sheriff says they have no leads			2
they still have n’t found 88 - year - old mr @entity8 ’s severed head			1
one of the @entity8 ’s three heartbroken children , @entity30 said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive , but they say their parents did n’t have a single enemy in the world			1
he is still desperate for the safe return of his 87 - year - old mother , but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a , ‘ sick ’ murderer is just too much for him to bear			1
speaking to @entity82 , @entity30 , 55 , from @entity83 , @entity84 , said : ‘ we are completely devastated , but our primary focus is finding our mother			1
the thought of her suffering is just unbearable			1
‘ each hour that goes by , my brother , my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened			0
‘ if she is still alive , we ca n’t imagine what she is going through			0
the human spirit is incredibly strong … but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father , just to ease her suffering			2
‘ whoever did this was so sick in the head that i just ca n’t imagine it			0
’ sick : @entity30 , pictured center left with wife @entity106 and other family members , said : ' the more we think about it , the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them			1
' he added it could have been the work of a cult @entity8 was last seen may 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated @entity116 east of @entity117			1
@entity26 had started the next day ’s newspaper crossword puzzle , but no one had taken the couple ’s may 3 mail out of their mailbox			2
that same day , last saturday , the @entity124 failed to show up at a friend ’s @entity126 party			2
according to @entity129 , @entity130 , financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the @entity132 would be the target of criminal activity			0
since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife			0
sheriff @entity130 has been forced to deny rumors that mr @entity8 – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters			1
he has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple ’s son @entity52 in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000			2
@entity52 was gunned down in @entity117 as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday			0
@entity152 was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder			0
he was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony			1
he has tried to appeal twice , but both attempts were denied			0
and @entity30 says that while his brother @entity163 , his sister @entity162 and him have considered a possible link between their brother ’s slaying and their father ’s murder , it just does n’t make sense			1
isolated : @entity30 reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side , but because they live at the end of a cul - de - sac with no other houses that close discovery : officers dredge a lake during the search for @entity26			1
her body was found by a fisherman he said : ‘ people have tried to link this to my brother ’s murder			1
we have obviously thought about that , because it is a violent connection to my parents , but that does n’t make sense either			2
‘ the individual is still in jail and anyway , my parents were n’t really involved in the case at the time			0
they did n’t attend court , so if this was some kind of revenge , they would not be obvious targets			0
‘ it is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned			0
we have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this , but we have no idea			0
‘ my father had n’t been in business for 20 years			2
he just spent his time relaxing and playing golf			0
he just did n’t have any enemies			0
‘ the more we think about it , the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them			0
‘ my parents live at the end of a @entity179 , so they have no neighbors either side			0
maybe that ’s why they were targeted ? ‘ it could have been anything , something to do with a cult , we just do n’t know			1
there were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery			2
my parents were comfortable , but they definitely were n’t wealthy			0
’ @entity30 and his siblings initially flew to @entity15 to try to help with the investigation , but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene			1
now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game , desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other			1
and heartbreakingly , sheriff @entity130 has said he is not optimistic she ’ll be found alive			2
speaking on tuesday , he said : ‘ i ’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty			2
’ there was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused monday at a @entity253 hospital was @entity26 , but that has been completely dismissed			0
concern : the alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a @entity126 party and @entity130 said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded			0
he said : ‘ no , the man was n’t in witness protection			1
he was n’t going to testify			0
there ’s no evidence of any kind of torture			2
’ on tuesday , they enlisted the aid of a @entity269 submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off @entity271 outside the couple ’s home			1
so far , they ’ve turned up nothing			0
@entity130 said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue			0
@entity30 – who like his late father , manages a chain of restaurants - said : ‘ the sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can			1
i spoke to him yesterday			0
he is holding back some information as it is important to the case			0
‘ the house is still a crime scene , they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake , but there just does n’t seem to be much in terms of leads			2
’ he added : ‘ my parents were married for 62 years			1
@entity298 was everything to them			0
their happiest times were spent with us , that ’s what they loved doing			2
we just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this			0
