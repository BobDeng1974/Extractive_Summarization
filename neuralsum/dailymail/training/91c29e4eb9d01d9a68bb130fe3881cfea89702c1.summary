by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:36 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 26 april 2012 the war of words between @entity4 and @entity5 continued this morning as the media mogul renewed his attack on the former prime minister 's ' state of mind '			1
in the opening minutes of the @entity10 , mr @entity4 said mr @entity5 ordered @entity11 to make up lies about an alleged secret deal with @entity14			1
the 81 - year - old said that @entity11 admitted in his autobiography that he ' did this under order from mr @entity5 knowing it to be false ' , adding : ' i think that reflects mr @entity5 's state of mind at the time			1
' @entity4 speaking on day two of the @entity10 mr @entity4 also rejected mr @entity5 's claim that he was wrong when he said the former prime minister ' declared war ' on the tycoon 's media empire after the @entity29 switched support to the conservatives in 2010			1
yesterday , mr @entity5 issued a frank denial of the conversation , but mr @entity4 said this morning : ' i said that very carefully yesterday , under oath , and i stand by every word of it			1
' mr @entity5 yesterday accused mr @entity4 of misleading the @entity10 following his comments on the disputed ' declare war ' conversation			1
in extraordinary testimony at the inquiry which prompted a war of words between the two men , mr @entity4 claimed mr @entity5 phoned him in 2009 to demand to know what was going on when @entity29 , his flagship newspaper , declared it was switching its backing from @entity48 to the @entity49			1
he said that during the conversation , accounts of which have circulated for months at @entity54 , it was clear that mr @entity5 was not in a ‘ balanced state of mind ’			1
back for day two : @entity4 with his wife @entity56 and son @entity57 leave his @entity58 flat in west @entity59 this morning as they head back to the @entity10 to be quizzed about phone hacking battle : @entity5 and @entity4 were engaged in an incredible war of words last night with the former prime minister accused of making a ' threatening ' phone call to the media mogul when @entity29 dropped support for @entity48 in 2009 mr @entity4 said that when @entity29 declared its support for mr @entity14 in september 2009 he had told mr @entity5 : ‘ i ’m sorry to tell you @entity5 , we will support a change of government when there is an election			1
’ he said mr @entity5 responded : ‘ well , your company has declared war on the government			1
we have no alternative but to declare war on your company			2
’ mr @entity4 told the inquiry : ‘ i said , “ i ’m sorry about that @entity5 , thank you for calling ” , and that was that			1
i do n’t think he was in a very balanced state of mind ... i do n’t know			1
’ last night mr @entity5 issued a tersely worded public statement , insisting : ‘ i did not phone mr @entity4 or meet him , or write to him about his decision			1
the only phone call i had with mr @entity4 in the last year of my time in office was a phone call specifically about @entity96 and his newspaper ’s coverage of the war			1
threatened : @entity4 said @entity5 was not ' in a balanced state of mind ' when he phoned him as he gave evidence to the @entity10 yesterday ‘ this was in the second week of november after his newspaper , @entity29 , printed a story in the second week of november about the death of a soldier and his mother ’s complaints			1
‘ i hope mr @entity4 will have the good grace to correct his account			1
’ his denial is exceptionally serious , as it alleges mr @entity4 was not telling the truth at a judicial inquiry where witnesses swear on oath to do so			1
the feud between the two men , who were once so close that their wives held a ‘ slumber party ’ together at @entity119 , the prime minister ’s official residence , escalated in the dying days of the @entity123			2
mr @entity4 ’s allies note that @entity48 figures close to mr @entity5 have since led the pursuit of his empire over the phone - hacking scandal			1
cosy relationship : @entity5 and his wife @entity129 with @entity4 and his wife @entity56 shortly after mr @entity5 became prime minister in 2007 big smile : @entity4 is driven away with his wife @entity56 after giving evidence to the @entity10 at the @entity135 in central @entity59 yesterday giving evidence to @entity138 ’s inquiry into the @entity139 yesterday , mr @entity4 , 81 , used glowing terms to describe mr @entity5 ’s nemesis @entity141 , saying he was ‘ impressive ’ and a personal friend who was god - father to his daughter @entity143			1
he even revealed it was true he had joked to mr @entity141 , when he was @entity148 in the early 1990s : ‘ if our flirtation is ever consummated , @entity149 , then i suspect we ’ll end up making love like porcupines – very , very carefully			2
’ the @entity153 chairman and chief executive insisted he had never asked any politician for commercial favours , and resented the implication that his newspapers backed political parties depending on such factors			0
‘ if that had been the case we would have endorsed the @entity163 in every election , ’ he said			0
‘ but i did n’t			0
i was interested in issues			0
i want to put it to bed once and for all , that that is a complete myth ... that i used the influence of @entity29 or the supposed political power to get favourable treatment			0
’ in a moment of levity , mr @entity4 caused laughter when describing the ‘ pyjama party ’ held by mr @entity5 ’s wife @entity129 at @entity119 which was attended by former @entity29 editor @entity177 and mr @entity4 ’s wife @entity178			1
‘ i think there were just a bunch of women , mainly complaining about their husbands probably , ’ he said			0
in his testimony , mr @entity4 also attacked mr @entity5 for his ‘ outrageous ’ suggestion that @entity29 had hacked medical records to get the story of mr @entity5 ’s son @entity187 being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis			1
the inquiry heard mr @entity4 ’s visits to @entity191 were always by the back door because prime ministers ‘ do n’t want me to be photographed going in the front ’ , adding : ‘ it happens to be a shortcut to my apartment so it ’s quite ok			2
’ by @entity198 @entity4 swore on a @entity199 to tell the truth			2
minutes later , after he had assured us that he never sought commercial favours from prime ministers , there came a crash of thunder from the heavens			0
it may or may not have been an expression of scepticism from the @entity211 but it lent proceedings an air of @entity214 , which invariably featured thunder and lightning , normally when the baddie was terrifying @entity218			0
the inquiry is being held in court 73 at the @entity221 , the same room where the @entity223 was conducted			0
shades of a @entity229 clinic			0
evidence : @entity4 gestures as he gives evidence before @entity138 yesterday @entity232 wears no robes or wig			2
en route to the court i passed a wig shop in a street behind the building			0
in the window : two wigged , waxwork heads , one of them a ringer for @entity246			0
@entity138 sits on a dais before a dull blue curtain which may have been borrowed from one of those passport photo booths			0
mr @entity4 , who dingo - loped into the room accompanied by a bodyguard and karate - chopster wife @entity56 ( in pale blue nail varnish ) , was seated at a sparse interrogation table			2
he scrunched his eyes , giving his 81 - year - old face the appearance of a scowl			0
he could have been a character in a @entity262 play			0
the day was intriguing chiefly for the personality of its star witness , this leathery , contemplative , gum - sucking abo ’ elder of the global power pod			0
at a parliamentary committee last summer he seemed barely compos			0
he may have taken a while to respond to some questions from the inquiry ’s leading counsel , @entity273 , @entity274 , but that was because @entity277 ’s mental cogs and spools were swivelling , analysing dangers from every aspect , computing the ramifications of each word about to be glurped from his molten core			0
the voice was scratchy , sometimes fluting , whistly			0
mr @entity4 said that when his @entity29 announced it was dumping @entity48 , @entity5 telephoned			1
the two men had a soft - volume conversation ( they ’re always the nasty ones ) in which mr @entity5 said he would ‘ make war ’ on mr @entity4			1
mr @entity5 was not ‘ in a very balanced state of mind ’			1
straitjacket for @entity5 ! joint appearance : @entity4 and @entity141 together at a news conference in 2008 mr @entity5 was one of several bystanders to take some buckshot in the rump			1
sir @entity296 , @entity297 editor and a darling of the @entity299 , was horribly punctured when mr @entity4 alleged that this great @entity300 once begged his boss to ‘ tell me what you want me to say ’			2
the late @entity304 overstated his connections			0
@entity306 had been a ‘ very bad ’ governor of @entity307			0
when mr @entity273 mentioned @entity309 poohbah @entity308 , mr @entity4 drily asked : ‘ who ’s he ? ’ a scribe from mr @entity308 ’s sister paper enjoyed that putdown			2
the judge intervened occasionally , once after mr @entity4 said prominent people should expect to be inspected by the gumshoes of the @entity139			2
@entity138 wondered if that was fair about , say , actors			0
were they also fair game ? one does hope the inquiry does not think politics is confined to parliamentarians and officials			0
some of society ’s most powerful people are in the arts and business			0
as for mr @entity273 , he is that scruffy one with the stubble you may have seen in coverage of the inquiry			2
could be a robber caught on a petrol station ’s cctv			0
if his questions seemed to move slowly , that was because they covered an impractically long period			0
a right - winger such as i might have discerned that he was not a natural reader of @entity29 when he asked mr @entity4 if he was a @entity344 , he might have been asking if he had scabies			2
and a reference to editorial decisions made at least this listener suspect that mr @entity273 regards newspaper readers ’ views as being distinctly below the salt .			2

mr @entity4 stands by the ' declare war ' conversation he claims he had with @entity5
last night former *pm* issued a frank denial and accused mr @entity4 of lying
mr @entity4 said he did *n't* think mr @entity5 was in a ' balanced state of mind '
