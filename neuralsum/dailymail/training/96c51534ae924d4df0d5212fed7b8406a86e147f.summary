@entity0 dedicated the entire first segment of his show on monday to address the controversy over a satirical tweet taken out of context			1
last wednesday , the comedian made a joke during his show about how @entity9 , the head of the @entity12 ' football team , has set up a charity in an effort to help diffuse the ongoing tensions over the team 's widely - criticized name			1
in that vein , the @entity19 host likened @entity9 's move to @entity0 's hypothetical decision to create the ' @entity23 to @entity24 '			1
explaining himself : in addition to an apocalyptic opening ' nightmare ' sequence and a brief foray into news , @entity0 directly addressed the # @entity31 issue on monday 's show offensive : the official @entity35 account for @entity36 posted this yesterday during monday 's show , @entity0 explained that the firestorm started after one of the show 's @entity35 accounts posted a tweet about the joke without referencing the larger context or providing a link to the entire bit			1
' who would have thought a means of communication limited to 140 characters would ever cause misunderstanding , ' he said			0
the @ @entity53 in question prompted people to launch a ' @entity31 ' hashtag calling for the show to be dropped			0
' the @entity59 people think that even in context , i am racist			0
i just want to say i am not a racist			0
i do n't even see race , not even my own			0
people tell me i 'm white and i believe them because i just spent six minutes explaining how i am not a racist - and that is about the whitest thing you could do , ' he said on monday			2
facing the tweets : @entity0 admitted that the tweet , which was posted by someone at his network , did not provide any context for the satire apology : the account was forced to post an apology and a disclaimer to say the tweet had nothing to do with @entity0 i share your rage : @entity0 's official @entity35 account distanced itself from the offending tweet @entity0 pointed to the tweet - as opposed to the four reruns of the show and a @entity89 post on the show 's official page - as the source of the outrage which he argued was a result of the lack of context			1
he joked that the @ @entity98 tweet was the point when ' the twit hit the fan '			1
supporters - and @entity0 himself - derided the controversy for missing the point of his original criticism : that the @entity12 owner 's charity ' which some have called an obvious attempt to win over @entity111 because it only uses the word @entity12 once '			1
@entity0 went on to point out that @entity35 seems to be fine with ( @entity9 's charity ) because i have n't seen s * * * about that '			1
the hashtag was reportedly started by a ' @entity35 hashtag activist - or " hashtivist " ' who identifies herself as @entity121			0
though she has been criticized online since the launch of # @entity31 , the host urged his supporters not to berate her			0
he did not mention her by name , but alluded to a woman ' who has been viciously attacked on @entity35 and if anyone 's doing that for me , i want you to stop right now			0
she 's just speaking her mind , and that 's what @entity35 's for , as well as ruining the ending of every show i have n't seen yet '			2
@entity135 , one of the founders of @entity35 helped him ' kill ' the @ @entity137 handle before directing followers to turn to his personal account , @ @entity140 for any future tweets			2
the @ @entity137 handle has since been discontinued			0
video from @entity19 's @entity36			2

the @entity36 account - which was run by @entity19 and not the comedian 's team directly - tweeted quote from a joke on the show
did not include a link to the video or explain how he was making *fun* of @entity12 ' owner @entity9 's new charity
outrage followed the @entity36 tweet about a *fictitious* ' @entity160 ' charity
@entity0 himself tweeted he had nothing to do with the post and addressed the issue for 10 minutes during monday 's show
has now *deleted* the @ @entity98 account entirely
also interviewed @entity35 founder @entity135 during the show
