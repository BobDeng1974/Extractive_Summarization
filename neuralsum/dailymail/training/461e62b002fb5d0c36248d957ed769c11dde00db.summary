by @entity0 if you took all the world 's population and dumped them into the @entity6 they would n't fill a fraction of it			2
in fact the 7.2 billion people would only form a comparatively tiny pile - as shown in this fascinating mock - up image			2
the graphic was put together by respected @entity15 presenter @entity14 on his @entity14 channel , which juxtaposes the population of the world alongside the famous deep canyon by the @entity19 - situated in @entity20			1
in fact the 7.2 billion people would only form a comparatively tiny pile - as shown in this fascinating mock - up image apparently , even all of humanity throughout history , across all the ages - estimated to be 106 billion - would only be enough to make 15 piles across the @entity6 and not sufficient to cover its entirety			1
the vast crevasse is 277miles ( 446km ) long and a mile ( 1.6km ) deep in places			0
the graphic is based upon the work of data visualisation blogger @entity41 who said that as the average weight of a human is 154lbs ( 70kg ) , seven billion people would weigh around 490million tonnes			2
the graphic was put together by @entity15 channel @entity14 , which juxtaposed the population alongside the famous deep steep sided canyon by the @entity19 - situated in @entity20 in the @entity51 he wrote in a post : ‘ since we are comprised of mostly water , which has a density of 1000 kg / cubic metre , the average volume of a human is 0.07cubic metres			1
‘ that means the total volume of all humans would be 490 million cubic metres , a cube with sides 788metres long			0
’ if this cube was placed next to the world ’s tallest building – the @entity65 in @entity66 , which is 2,716ft ( 828metres ) tall , it would be 131 ft ( 40metres ) taller			0
the @entity70 receives around five million visitors a year , 90 per cent of whom travel to the @entity6 , which has an average elevation of 7,000ft ( 2,134metres )			0
apparently , even all of humanity throughout history , across all the ages - estimated to be 106 billion - would only be enough to make fifteen piles across the @entity6 and not sufficient to cover its entirety nature in all its glory : tourists take it all in at the @entity84			1
the park receives close to five million visitors a year			0

all of humanity through the ages ( 106 billion ) would make fifteen piles in the canyon by the @entity19
