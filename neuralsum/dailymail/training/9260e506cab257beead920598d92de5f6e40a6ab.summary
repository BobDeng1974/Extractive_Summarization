the biggest test in international football is to play in front of 90,000 spectators in a @entity5 semi-final against @entity6 or @entity7			1
in the absence of anything like that coming any time soon for @entity13 ’s players , an entirely different proposition is a a @entity15 qualifier against the world ’s worst international football team			1
against opposition as pitiful as @entity20 , it is about professionalism @entity13 striker @entity22 is brought down for a penalty by @entity20 's @entity24 @entity22 scores from the spot to put @entity13 2 - 0 ahead against @entity20 for three days , since @entity13 ’s players met at @entity28 on monday evening , they have been psyching themselves up to play a team that could barely string two passes together			1
@entity31 is no place for @entity20			0
this was a night to get the job done , to show focus before @entity13 travel to @entity37 on sunday for a slightly trickier clash in @entity39 against @entity40			2
in many ways @entity13 ’s players , who toyed with their opponents throughout , should be congratulated for taking a game like this as seriously as they did			1
here , in front of just over 50,000 die - hard @entity13 fans at the national stadium , they simply wore down their opponents until they surrendered			1
it took only 23 minutes			0
in years to come , it is to be hoped that the @entity49 follow through with their proposal to take matches like this around the country @entity55 @entity54 scored @entity13 ’s opening goal , there was a polite ripple of applause from the fans in the stands			1
it was like being at the tennis			0
@entity13 's @entity64 scores the third goal against @entity20 at @entity31 on thursday @entity66 continued his international education against sub-standard opposition @entity20 were painful to watch			1
they boast a right back in @entity71 who , unfathomably , just threw the ball over @entity75 ’s goal - line from a throw - in			2
what a night it was for the @entity78 , too : at half time neither @entity79 nor @entity80 had managed to get into double figures in terms of touches			0
they got there in the end , just after the start of the second half			0
in the dug - out @entity90 broke into sporadic fits of laughter as he waited , patiently , for @entity13 to score again			1
he will learn nothing about the ability of his players on the ball when @entity13 are playing opposition that would struggle to beat the best eleven pub players from your village			2
instead it is part of a learning process for these players , accepting that internationals can throw up some ridiculous matches			0
@entity20 pair @entity79 and @entity106 were on damage limitation exercise so the likes of @entity109 , @entity66 , @entity110 and others can continue their international education against sub-standard opposition			0
there was not a hint of arrogance about them , from the moment @entity13 sang the national anthem with their now traditional gusto to the embraces at the final whistle			2
these are cheap caps against scarcely credible opposition , but the younger gang in the @entity13 squad are learning what it means to play at @entity31 for the national team			1
they know that the minimum acceptable number of goals against the 208th - best team in the world is four or five on home soil it creates a different environment and that can only be a good thing for a team that must grow together before they set foot in @entity143 for the finals in 2016			2
other than that , what is the head coach supposed to glean from a game like this ? manager @entity90 could afford a smile as @entity13 enjoyed a comfortable victory for some reason he gave a little fist pump when @entity22 scored his 42nd goal in an @entity13 shirt from the penalty spot just before half time			1
captain and coach have a flourishing relationship			0
he will be pleased with the contribution of others , especially @entity162 after he was stationed in a deep - lying central midfield position in the first half			0
it was a decent performance from the @entity167 midfielder , but no - one involved with the national team will get carried away after this			0
good on @entity64 for adding @entity13 ’s third after the break , but there are far bigger tests to come for @entity90 ’s squad			1
@entity174 , @entity175 and the @entity176 all feature in the international calendar before the end of the season			0
let ’s be honest , those games can not come quickly enough .			0

@entity13 have been psyching themselves up in team meetings and training *sessions* to play a team that could barely string two passes together
against the world ’s worst international football team , @entity90 's side just had to be professional
when @entity54 scored @entity13 ’s opening goal , there was a polite ripple of applause from the fans . it was like being at the tennis
