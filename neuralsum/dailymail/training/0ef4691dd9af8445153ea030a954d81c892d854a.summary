' these children are desperate for help and often believe death is the only way out			1
this is a huge issue as so many are suicidal			2
' the blackmailers who ask for money often use foreign bank accounts but the ones who ask for sexual material seem to be @entity7			2
' the people give them a time limit and say , " if you do n't do this within an hour or two hours we will put the pictures online "			2
' because it is a space for teenagers , it attracts predators and paedophiles			1
it is like an online school playground			0
