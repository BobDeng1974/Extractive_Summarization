but what do we want to learn ? how to create the perfect smokey eye is the most in - demand tutorial , followed by how to contour , highlight , do fancy dress make - up and pencil in our eyebrows			1

@entity59 favourite @entity30 accumulates 10m views per month on her channel , has almost 2m subscribers and 500k @entity64 followers			0
industry leader : @entity66 @entity54 is @entity22 's leading star beauty vlogger with almost six million subscribers so influential is @entity30 that she has created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in @entity72			1
when the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com , they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed			0
speaking to @entity80 about her success , the 24 - year - old said : ' i 'm not entirely sure how my @entity22 channel has become such a success , but i think it could be to do with my positive , friendly personality			2
selfie tips : @entity30 has created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes about to hit @entity72 on the back of her @entity22 success ' i think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as i 'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable , i 'm still just a normal girl despite my large following			2
' people say that when they watch my videos thy feel like i 'm their friend and i love that			2
when i meet fans in the street i always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely ! ' i think the world of @entity22 is amazing in that you can feel like you 're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video			0
it 's also incredible in that , if it was n't for my @entity22 channel , i would n't have started my own makeup line			0
' i could n't have done it without the support of my fans			0
i spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way			0
i started with these products as i feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots			2
' i love the colours i designed so much and i named them after all of my favourite things and places			0
for example , i got engaged in @entity134 so i named one of the darker polishes @entity134 night and i love picnics so i named my favourite pretty pink gloss @entity139			0
' @entity30 's good friend @entity141 , who goes by the online name of @entity141 , has four million fans and @entity144 of @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 are also @entity22 heavyweights			0
speaking about the @entity22 video and beauty blogging phenomenon , journalist and beauty blogger @entity149 said : ' the great thing about online beauty tutorials is that they are incredibly relatable and easy to follow at home			1
' the people in the videos give easy step - by - step guides and give opinions and thoughts on products which appear to be completely genuine and honest			2
beauty chat : @entity146 ( right ) and @entity147 are also @entity22 heavyweights ' seeing a product being used by a regular person - as opposed to a celebrity , or someone who has been photographed in the glossy pages of a magazine - gives a much more honest portrayal of how the product will really perform			1
' i think it ’s the honesty and the relatable nature of the videos that make them so appealing			0
