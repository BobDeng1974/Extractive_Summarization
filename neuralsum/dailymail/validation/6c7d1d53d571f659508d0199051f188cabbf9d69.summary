arranging to meet a stranger in a busy cafe last week , i needed to describe my appearance			1
i started : ‘ i have long , dark hair with a fringe			1
’ that ’s not because it ’s an easy way to spot me , but because my hairstyle is the very thing that i recognise myself by — when i look in the mirror , when i picture myself , when i think of myself in the past or the future , it is my hair that i see first			1
for while other people might notice different features , or describe themselves in terms of their clothes , height or figure , for me it has always been this one thing that defines me			1
some women use their hair to reflect their mood or a time in their life , they like to chop and change with the seasons and follow trends			2
then there are women like me — and @entity39 — who keep the same hairstyle throughout their entire lives			1
this week , @entity39 tweeted a photo of her childhood hair — golden , thick , long and framed with a fringe — identical to the style she still has			1
for us , our hairstyle is such a fundamental part of who we are that to change it would be as brutal and unthinkable as having plastic surgery			1
cutting my hair off would be like losing part of my soul			2
it ’s not that i think my hair is particularly fabulous — it might well look better with a different cut — but it ’s the consistency that counts			2
@entity39 : the socialite tweeted this picture of herself as a young girl ( left ) with the words : ' if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it			1
' @entity62 : today she 's a red carpet icon , but the busy @entity65 a-lister was wearing an ' undone up - do ' at ten since i was five it has always been shoulder length or just below with a choppy fringe			2
sometimes it is longer , sometimes there are a few layers , but though i am 53 , i have n’t changed my style since childhood			1
back then , my grandmother cut it with kitchen shears ; now @entity76 , my lovely @entity77 hairdresser , uses high - tech scissors at vast expense			2
but the end result is pretty much the same			2
so while many people have embarrassing teenage photos of themselves with a mullet , perm or a disastrous dye , my ‘ look ’ — if you can call it that — has never wavered			2
and i relish that fact ; i love peering nostalgically at photos of me in my 20s partying with friends and spotting the hair i still have and love			2
or looking at my glowing , gloriously happy face at my wedding in 1989 and still admiring the hairdo			2
and somehow the style has come to encapsulate my character — it is shiny on a good day , albeit slightly messy and reliably straight			1
my style is driven by my personality , too , for while there are women who do n’t mind facing the world with their hair scraped back off their face or with pixie cuts that mean every emotion is visible , i am not one of them			1
@entity112 : from the age of nine to today , @entity114 's model daughter favours long blonde girlish waves @entity117 : the model , singer , actress and rocker 's ex-wife has kept the blonde centre parting she had as a nine - year - old i need my hair to hide behind , to chew when i am thinking , to pull over my face when i am embarrassed			2
for me , my hair is a veil , a barrier between me and the unkind scrutiny of the world			0
i do n’t want people to see what i am thinking all the time			0
but it is a mental barrier , too — a comfort blanket , an unchanging element as my face changes			0
my world has transformed since i was a child , but throughout school , university , marriage and children , one thing has remained constant : my hair			1
without the hairstyle i have always known i would feel strange and vulnerable			1
i ’m certainly not alone			0
i used to work on tv makeover programmes and we would ruthlessly change women ’s hairstyles because we knew that would guarantee an enormous emotional response			0
only once have i experienced that trauma — and i have never been tempted to alter my hair again			0
i was 36 and the hairdresser talked me into having a really short haircut			0
i had just started a new job and part of me thought a sharp new style might turn me into a sharp , decisive person			1
the hairdresser cut it without a mirror , so i had no preparation for the shock of seeing my face without its normal framing			0
@entity163 : the award - winning actress and titanic star obviously loves the casual wavy style she sported at nine @entity168 : at 13 she was @entity65 royalty , and 37 years later the actress still has chic long tresses i was hoping for liberation ; instead when i saw myself shorn all i felt was horror			1
when i went home , my six - year - old daughter burst into inconsolable tears , crying : ‘ you do n’t look like my mummy any more			0
’ even my husband , who does n’t know the difference between a dress and a skirt , was shocked			0
‘ why did n’t you tell me you were going to do this ? ’ he kept asking			0
though he did n’t say it , i knew he was thinking : ‘ you do n’t look like my wife any more			0
’ and for several days , until the shock had worn off , my husband and daughter avoided looking at me as much as possible			0
i felt much the same way as my family — every time i looked in the mirror i could barely see myself there			0
for while i thought that cutting my hair would make me feel like @entity195 in @entity196 — young , free and liberated — i felt like @entity197 in the @entity198 , who lost all his strength when his hair was lopped off			0
@entity201 : the catwalk queen retains the simple , quick and easy hairstyle she wore as an outdoors - loving school athlete @entity205 : from tomb raider star to @entity208 envoy , she favours the sideswept look she had at the age of 11 i stopped feeling attractive			1
i could n’t tell a story , let alone flirt , without my hair to play with			0
my hair took about six months to grow back — the longest six months of my life — and since then i have done nothing to it except a careful trim and colour to keep the grey hairs at bay			0
basically , just what i need to do to keep my hair looking exactly as it always has			0
when my mother died two years ago , i found a cache of photographs of her as a young woman			0
in the last years of her life she had worn her hair up mostly , but when i saw these photos i realised she , too , kept the same hairstyle pretty much all her life — and it was identical to mine , shoulder length with a fringe			1
so , this hairstyle has n’t just been worn for one lifetime , but two			1
of course , there are moments when i think i should try a more mature hairstyle			1
but despite my advanced age , i simply do n’t think i am mature enough to cope without my hair			0
for in my heart i am still a little girl peering through her fringe — and that ’s what my hair helps me see in the mirror , too			0
@entity246 : prince @entity248 's former girlfriend proves the low - maintenance style that suited her at 11 still does			1
