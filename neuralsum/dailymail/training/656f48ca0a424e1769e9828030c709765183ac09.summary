that determination could come as soon as wednesday			0

she has n't improved since sunday , when she and her husband went to @entity62 in @entity33 after church			1
investigators and the restaurant manager have told the @entity102 that a worker mistook the cleaning product for sugar and accidentally mixed large quantities of it into the iced - tea dispenser , @entity94 said			1
' it 's disturbing that this kind of toxic , poisonous material would be in the food prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat , ' the attorney said			1
' i do n't know how something like that can happen			0
' fighting for her life : @entity6 , left , pictured with one of her daughters , drank the tea at the restaurant following church loved : her family , including her husband @entity127 , pictured , have been by her bedside in the hospital @entity33 police are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the sweet - tea container , but they think it was accidental , @entity131 cpl. @entity32 said			1

they have determined @entity6 is the only victim , @entity32 said			1
it appears she was the first to drink the tea that day , and restaurant employees dumped it out after she was burned , he said			2
@entity145 , owner of the @entity147 franchise , said in a statement thursday that he 's praying for @entity6 and cooperating with investigators			1
he said he would refrain from commenting on the specifics of what happened out of respect for the @entity102			0
his restaurant is one of @entity155 's around the country in the @entity158 - based chain			2
@entity94 said he will wait for the police investigation to finish before determining what legal action to take			2
the chemical , also known as sodium hydroxide , comes in both liquid and powder form			0
the one the worker added to the tea was a powder , @entity94 said			0
the chemical also is in products such as @entity171 , said @entity172 , professor of chemistry at the @entity173			0
' it would start dissolving your insides , ' he said			0
doctors are trying to determine if it caused any tears in @entity6 's esophagus or stomach , @entity94 said			1
questions : the family 's attorney , @entity94 , holds a photograph of @entity127 and @entity6 during a news conference last week			1
he said the restaurant told him an employee had confused the two powders the woman lives in the @entity63 suburb of @entity192 with her husband of 47 years , @entity194			1

@entity194 and the couple 's children are by her side at the hospital , praying for her recovery , @entity94 said			0

the restaurant has remained open since the incident , said @entity220 , @entity221 manager at the @entity222			0
