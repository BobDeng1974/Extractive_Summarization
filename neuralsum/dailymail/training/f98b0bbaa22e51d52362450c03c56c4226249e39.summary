@entity1 winner @entity0 insists rugby union is no more dangerous in the professional era than it has ever been			1
the 35 - year - old former @entity5 fly - half suffered more than his fair share of time in the treatment room during an illustrious career which drew to a close at the end of last season			1
but at the end of a week which saw national coach @entity15 lose back row @entity16 having already faced up to the absence of fellow forwards @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 for the autumn internationals , @entity0 is confident a greater reliance on sports science will protect players , provided they act responsibly themselves			1
@entity0 receives attention during @entity5 's @entity31 match against @entity32 in 2008 @entity0 pictured with the @entity1 in @entity33 on friday speaking at an event in @entity33 a year to the day before the city hosts its first fixture of the @entity1 2015 , he said : ' i do n't necessarily believe there is a great deal more injury going on now since professionalism really kicked in during the late 1990s			1
most of it is contact injuries which ca n't be avoided			1
the ones you avoid are the ones where you have got to say , ' we ca n't accept this '			2
you ca n't have guys missing seasons because they are n't being looked after properly , pulling muscles in training and those sort of things			2
' there is that , but you ca n't change the fact that guys are going to get bigger			2
the problem is not so much they are getting bigger , it 's that the bigger ones can run faster			2
that is the issue , because that is what creates the power			0
' we need to make sure that guys are well looked after			0
you have got to listen to players and try to balance up this pressure to succeed all the time			1
@entity5 's @entity0 kicks a penalty during extra time in the 2003 @entity1 final ' that 's difficult when you have got teams that are suffering relegation issues , teams that are fighting for titles and players coming back from injury			1
' you want to say , ' just play this game for us , you 'll be all right and if you can just do this one , we will give you two weeks off '			0
' it 's a difficult one to fight because i have been in that situation several times and i would always choose to play			0
but you love rugby and you think , ' i might not get this chance again '			1
' but now i am retired , i am just so glad that i can walk around happily , and i know that i can still go to the gym and i can get on a bike and i can run around a little bit			0
' you never know what that next knock is going to mean , so the player has to be responsible as well , enough to say , ' look , i am not actually feeling good , this does n't feel right ' because that 's the only way that people get the right feedback , if you speak honestly			0
' @entity0 , who was sidelined by a succession of serious ankle , shoulder , knee and groin injuries during a 17 - year - playing career capped by the drop - goal which clinched the 2003 @entity1 , admits retirement has brought some relief from the pressures top - class rugby put on his body			1
@entity0 insists rugby union is no more dangerous in the professional era than it has ever been however , he is not sorry to see the back of the powerhouse runners - and those from @entity120 and @entity121 in particular - who at times left him clasping at fresh air in his latter days at @entity124			1
he said : ' that was one of the reasons , other than the pressure , why i gave up in @entity129			0
i was pretty glad to get out of the way of some of these guys			0
' some of the wingers over there are incredible			0
they run at you and you get prepared for the biggest collision of your life and then as you go for that , they then dance around you and run off somewhere else and you think , ' what am i supposed to do ? '			0
' that was the no - win situation i am kind of glad i do n't have to face anymore			2
