the wanderings of polar bears are of particular interest to scientists studying the effects of global warming			1
and now a tool allows people to watch polar bears as they pad across the ice of @entity10 , @entity11 , from the comfort of their homes			1
the @entity14 shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area			1
click on a polar bear to view its details ... by clicking on a bear in the interactive map , you can see what date it was collared , how many cubs it has , its weight and the distance it has travelled			1
there is also an option to sponsor the bear			0
the map , created by @entity35 - based @entity34 , can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years , as water temperature are believed to have risen			1
‘ we ’ve discovered some incredible things about polar bear movement patterns while they are on the ice , such as the fact that a single female bear can travel more than 2,485 miles ( 4,000 kilometres ) in a single season , ’ said @entity34 ’s @entity40			0
sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in the bears ’ southern range			1
as the bears spend longer periods without food , their health declines			0
unhealthy bears can lead to lower reproduction rates - and local extinction			0
scientists have found the main cause of death for cubs to be either lack of food or lack of fat on nursing mothers			0
for every week earlier the ice breaks up in @entity10 , bears come ashore roughly 22 lbs ( 10 kg ) lighter and in poorer condition			2
many ecologists fear that polar bears face an uncertain future as they rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn when food is hard to come by			1
sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in @entity10			1
as the bears spend longer and longer periods without food , their health and strength declines , which in turn means less cubs and the prospect of extinction			0
while the future seems bleak , scientists insist that there is still time to save the large mammals , which is key to understanding changes happening in the @entity105			0
the organisation said that by tracking polar bears they will better understand how the population is faring			2
‘ most of what we know about polar bears we know from capturing them and then releasing them alive at the site of capture , ’ they said			2
by clicking on a bear in the interactive map , you can see what date it was collared , how many cubs it has , its weight and the distance it has travelled			1
there 's also an option to sponsor the bear ‘ capture efforts repeated regularly over multi-year periods also allow for an estimation of reproduction and survival rates , along with estimations of population size			0
’ each spring and fall , scientists put new satellite collars on a small number of bears to follow the bears ’ movements , habitat use , fidelity to areas , and the survival of their cubs			0
sensors also allow scientists to detect how much time the bears spend in the water , which is important in reference to arctic sea ice loss			2
collars are designed to fall off on their own in 14 months			0
scientists collar only female bears because male polar bears ’ necks are as wide as their heads and collars slip off			2
‘ for me , it ’s not only exciting to make use of technology in research right now , but it ’s exciting to imagine what might be possible in the future , ’ mr @entity40 said			0
