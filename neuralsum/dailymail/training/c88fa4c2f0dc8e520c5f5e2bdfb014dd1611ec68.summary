a midwife with more than 20 years ' experience may be able to return to her position despite being sacked for telling a woman in labour that she would ' get the baby out with a knife and fork '			1
@entity8 , a senior nurse at @entity9 , was dismissed after the foul - mouthed rant in which she also told the patient : ' i 've been a midwife for 20 f * * * * * * years and no f * * * * * is telling me how to f * * * * * * care for a f * * * * * * woman in labour '			1
mrs @entity8 , who had worked at the hospital since 1993 , admitted charges brought by the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and agreed to be subjected to certain sanctions for three years			1
@entity8 , a nurse at @entity9 ( pictured ) , was dismissed after the foul - mouthed rant however , an @entity21 panel this week rejected the provisional agreement and ruled that mrs @entity8 should face a fresh hearing because the case ' although serious , was at the lower end of the scale of misconduct '			1
it means that while she initially faced working under sanctions for three years due to her behaviour , she may be able to return to midwifery work as normal if given permission to do so by the panel			0
the tribunal heard that mrs @entity8 had returned to work at the hospital following an absence when she launched the tirade on june 14 , 2012			2
the @entity43 agreement told how the patient recounted mrs @entity8 ' slurring her speech and behaving erratically '			1
the patient was not named in evidence of the case , but was instead referred to @entity49 the judgement read : ' @entity51 refers to the registrant recounting a previous patient who had a hypnotist as their birth partner			0
' she refers to the registrant then becoming animated and saying to her and her birth partner that she " had been a midwife for 20 f * * * * * * years and no f * * * * * is telling me how to f * * * * * * care for a f * * * * * * woman in labour "			2
' the patient refers to her shock that a health professional would use this language in a clinical area			0
' she also recounts feelings of concern when the registrant said to her " i will get your baby out with a knife and fork "			0
the matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing with the panel from the @entity21 ( above ) mrs @entity8 , who also admitted failing to ensure that patients wore name bands , keeping timely notes , and using a drug to induce a patient before it had been prescribed , admitted ' her actions fell seriously short of what would be expected of a registered midwife ' and that the language had been ' entirely inappropriate '			1
the @entity21 said there was no evidence to suggest any harm was caused to any of the patients in her care on june 14 , 2012 and that mrs @entity8 had displayed remorse and insight into her behaviour			2
panel chair @entity99 said : ' [ the panel ] was satisfied that a member of the public in full knowledge of the circumstances of the case , and being aware of the insight and remediation demonstrated , would not consider a finding of impairment necessary to uphold the reputation of the profession and maintain proper standards			0
' in all the circumstances , the panel was unable to endorse the @entity43 agreement in relation to the finding of impairment			0
' since may , 2013 , mrs @entity8 has worked as a nurse at @entity9 's @entity120			1
the panel said it did not consider there was a ' real risk ' of her behaviour being repeated			0
mrs @entity8 , who had worked at the hospital for more than 20 years prior to the tirade of abuse , admitted charges brought by the @entity21 and now faces a disciplinary hearing over her conduct the matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing at a future date and if cleared , mrs @entity8 may be able to return to her position as midwife			1
a spokesman for @entity9 said : ' following a comprehensive management investigation , the @entity9 can confirm that , whilst no direct patient harm was found to have been caused , the midwife in question was deemed to have displayed serious and significant failings in her professional duty of care			2
' this investigation resulted in her dismissal from @entity9 women 's in december 2012 and the @entity9 also referred its findings to the midwife 's professional body , the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			2
' @entity9 is dedicated to providing safe , effective and compassionate care to all our women , their babies and their families			0
' any incidents that may impact on our ability to deliver those high standards are dealt with in a prompt and appropriate manner			0
