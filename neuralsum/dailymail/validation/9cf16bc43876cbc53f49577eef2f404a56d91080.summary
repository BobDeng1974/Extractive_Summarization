it ’s nearly time for @entity2 to make an emotional walk to the ring and fight @entity5 on march 28			1
he has the world at his feet again and i ’m looking at fights against the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in the summer and then the winner of @entity14 and @entity15			1
but it was so nearly game over for @entity2			1
i remember being sat next to his bed in the hospital in @entity21 and i did n’t know if he would fight again			2
i think it ’s hard for you or i to imagine to what he has been through since that horrific knife attack			2
but this guy is special			0
@entity5 is going to face a fighter in @entity30 who has only thought about fighting for the past six months			1
it has been hard on @entity2 – he won a world title and what was supposed to be his moment has been spent recovering from that attack			1
it ’s been a nightmare			0
@entity2 with his world title in september as he began his recovery from being stabbed in the leg the challenge – and it is a big challenge – will be handling himself in the right manner on the night			1
everyone wants to see how he comes back physically from what happened			0
but how will he cope with the emotions ? he will be in his own city , defending his title after all that frustration and pain			0
there is a lot that can go wrong in those circumstances			0
but @entity2 is different to normal people			1
the night he won his world title against @entity57 in @entity58 , the stakes were so high			0
he was fighting in @entity57 ’s backyard after having so many title shots postponed because of injury			0
a normal person could easily have been swallowed up by that pressure – the rest of us were properly nervous			0
i was there in his dressing room looking at him for a sign of how he was feeling			0
my dad walked over to @entity2 just before he put his gloves , grabbed his arm and said to him : ‘ this is your time , do n’t let this moment pass			1
' i went outside the dressing room and my dad was smiling			0
he said to me : ‘ that boy is barely breathing			0
he is about to fight for the world title in @entity79 and his pulse is so low			2
’ the @entity30 fighter lands a punch on @entity57 on his way to becoming world champion in august 2014 i am telling you , this guy has ice in his veins			0
he has been stabbed in the leg and could have died			2
now , a few months on he is fighting to retain his world title			0
people will doubt him but i wo n’t			0
that is why i will make the biggest fights possible for him if he comes through this next challenge against @entity5			1
i have already made contact with @entity10 ’s people and also @entity11 ’s representatives			1
@entity10 is a legend and that would be a huge fight and @entity11 has been a world champion			1
@entity12 is also keen and a quality fighter			1
any one of those guys in @entity30 in june would be a very big fight			1
after that , i would love to see @entity2 fight @entity14 or @entity15			1
after those two fight on may 2 , the winner and @entity2 will be the only world champions in the welterweight division			1
it would be a great unification match			0
of course , the fight the whole country wants to see is @entity2 versus @entity115			1
@entity115 ’s team told us the fight would happen one day but why not on june 13 at @entity119 ? we ca n’t wait forever for them			1
all @entity2 can do is take care of his own business later this month			1
it ’s a challenge but he always comes through			0
@entity2 is putting together his final training preparations before fighting @entity5 later this month another fight everyone is desperate to see is @entity126 versus @entity127			1
talks are underway between me and @entity131 ’s @entity130 , who look after @entity126			1
@entity127 is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on – we just want to make this fight			1
of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money			0
they will talk with their broadcaster and see what ’s on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible			2
after that , we can push negotiations on			0
i ’m not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - i would be happy for a 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the winner			2
if you really fancy it i ca n’t see a problem with that			0
we can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight – and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially			1
if we can all reach an agreement , then i would love to make this fight in june			1
we ’d be happy to fight in @entity168 if the numbers were right , but likewise @entity170 would be brilliant and so would the @entity171 in @entity172			2
there is a long way to go but who would n’t want to see this fight ? @entity127 ( right ) joins @entity126 in the ring after he beat @entity178 in @entity168 last month i was disappointed to lose the purse bids for @entity181 - @entity180 after some long negotiations with @entity180 ’s team			1
we backed our man to a tune of $ 2.1m but they put in a huge bid of $ 3.1m			0
i ’m confident @entity181 gets the victory regardless of the location and make history in the process			2
i am hearing rumours that the fight will be on april 24 in @entity194 but we back @entity181 to get the win			2
@entity196 is back in the @entity197 after his foray into @entity199			0
do n’t ask me how he came to be involved in the @entity201 film , but what a great opportunity for him			0
we will be talking in the coming days about his options , but rest assured after beating @entity206 last time out , he will be in a world title fight next time			2
we are looking at all four of the cruiserweight world champions			0
@entity211 , the @entity212 champion , is keen and appeals to us as well			0
but we would fight any of @entity214 ( @entity216 champion ) , @entity217 ( @entity218 ) or @entity219 ( @entity220 )			2
all are quality fighters and i have had good feedback on all options so watch this space			0
we are heading for a brilliant battle of @entity228 lightweights this summer			1
golden boy @entity229 was brilliant again in beating @entity230 in @entity228 at the weekend and @entity231 survived a huge scare against @entity233 on the same card			1
he was knocked down but got up and perforated @entity233 ’s ear drum to win			0
they are both huge draws in the city and now i am going to make the fight between them for this summer			1
they are a great mix. @entity231 ’s family is known all over @entity228 – they have a fruit and veg stall in the middle of the city and @entity247 is full of beans			1
@entity229 is already an @entity249 , the boy with an @entity251			2
@entity231 celebrates his win over @entity233 at the @entity253 on march 7 above all else , they are tremendous fighters			1
it will really divide the city			0
i am looking at the @entity257 and @entity258 , probably for a date in @entity260			0
many people would have @entity229 as favourite but how can anyone underestimate @entity231 ? this will be a huge night			1
i would like to say here how relieved i was to hear that @entity266 is ok after being taken to hospital following his defeat against @entity269 in @entity228 at the weekend			2
he looked in a bad way but has been given the all - clear , thankfully			0
it reminds you how tough this sport is and , for me , it reinforces that above all else these guys ought to get the paydays they deserve			0
people say that fighters should ignore the money and just get fights made – it is easy to say when you are not the one putting your health on the line for your living			2
fight for titles and fight for glory , of course , but let ’s remember what these athletes put themselves through in the process .			2

it *'s* time to judge what @entity2 is made of when he makes his *comeback* from being stabbed
i want to make summer fight with @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity12 if @entity2 beats @entity5 on march 28
but june 13 at @entity119 works if @entity115 wants to talk
then we want the winner of @entity15 and @entity14
talks have started over @entity126 vs @entity127
i will make @entity229 vs @entity231 in @entity228 in *mid-july*
