competitors on @entity1 – the popular @entity3 programme in which four houseproud people judge one another ’s homes – generally abide by an unwritten rule			0
it states that when the show is over , all agree it was a fair contest and the winners deserve the £ 1,000 prize			2
but nothing would persuade @entity15 and @entity16 , from near @entity17 in @entity18 , to agree			1
@entity16 , 34 , who appeared on the show on may 20 last year , says they lost only because ‘ the two people who won gave everyone else rubbish marks ’			2
this may sound like sour grapes , but given the effort and ingenuity that went into the couple ’s extraordinary @entity30 - themed home , filled with high - tech luxuries 007 would be proud of , their angst is understandable			1
@entity15 and @entity16 filled their @entity18 home with high - tech luxuries that @entity30 would be proud of @entity15 , 54 , a builder and developer , bought the building that stood on the site – an unprepossessing office block – shortly before the couple got together in 2009			1
he did n’t give much thought to it before they set off on a two - year , round - the - world trip , so it was in @entity46 that he finally sketched plans for a wildly futuristic home			2
‘ i had seen some wonderful modern houses when i lived in @entity54 a few years back , ’ he says , leading the way up the drive as the electric gates shut behind us			0
‘ i ’d also seen showpiece new homes like @entity56 and @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , where all the football stars live , so i had a general idea of what i wanted			0
’ @entity64 slate and @entity66 oak in the exterior walls give a hint of opulence , but it is when you cross the threshold that you see what this house is all about			0
couple ( pictured , @entity16 ) spent less than £ 1million building the house and are confident a buyer will snap up the property for its asking price of £ 1.45million a spiral staircase twirls upwards , and mirrors in the style of the @entity30 logo , etched with welcome to @entity86 ( a play on @entity30 film @entity89 ) , create an 007 vibe			1
we turn into the kitchen , with its white central island and enormous units @entity15 bought for £ 35,000 at a @entity95 show			1
then he leads us into the drawing room			0
the high - tech house is called @entity86 , a play on the @entity30 film @entity89 which starred @entity100 as 007 ‘ seeing the old offices was surreal , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity103 were left on the tables , coffee cups were half drunk , jackets had been left on the chairs ; there were even personal files left behind			0
it was like taking over the @entity110			0
’ upstairs , the master bedroom has everything but a bond girl in situ , while the children ’s rooms – for @entity118 , one , and @entity119 , two – lead on to a terrace enclosed by unbreakable glass			1
but the room where you can most easily see @entity30 relaxing with a shaken - not - stirred cocktail is the nightclub			1
with a karaoke machine , kitchen , disco lights and wood - burning fireplace , this room attracted the most attention on may the @entity1			0
mention of it brings a bond - villain smile to @entity15 ’s lips			2
‘ it was funny , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity16 must have spent two grand on entertaining the crew and competitors			2
she hired a white grand piano , brought in cocktail waiters and caterers , the lot			0
the prize was half that , and then she came third behind a terrace house and a man whose house was a kind of @entity150 ’s grotto			2
’ nevertheless , creating this 7,000 sq ft home has been a shrewd investment			1
@entity15 picked up the site ‘ for a song ’ and spent less than £ 1,000,000 on the build			1
one offer of the full asking price of £ 1,450,000 has fallen through , but he is sure it wo n’t take long to find a buyer for his @entity30 fantasy - house with its gardens and acre of paddocks			1
‘ since the recession , the government has encouraged people to build on brownfield sites , ’ he says			0
‘ there are still lots of unused office blocks			0
’ @entity86 is for sale at £ 1,450,000 with jackson - stops.co.uk , 01625 540340 .			1
