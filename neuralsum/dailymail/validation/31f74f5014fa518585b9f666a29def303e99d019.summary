@entity0 has been plotting @entity2 ’s survival mission for the past fortnight from him home in @entity4			1
the new boss has revealed that he was waiting for the @entity2 to sack @entity6 and was surprised it did not happen sooner			1
indeed , in the wake of @entity2 ’s 4 - 0 defeat to @entity11 on saturday there were reports that @entity0 was set to take over , despite this being some 48 hours before @entity6 was dismissed			1
reports in @entity4 suggest @entity0 was surprised his predecessor @entity6 was not sacked sooner @entity6 was sacked after @entity2 were beaten 4 - 0 at the @entity16 by rivals @entity11 @entity0 said @entity17 ( left ) will have to play despite not training in the week as the squad is small the @entity19 said : ‘ i expected they would do it ( sack @entity6 ) earlier , but they did n't			1
‘ @entity6 was a coach who is very self - focussed			1
they were looking for someone with experience , a guy who knows what it 's about			2
for this short time they did n't want to take the risk to get an inexperienced coach			2
’ @entity0 will take charge of the team for the first time at @entity36 tomorrow and , with his new club just one point above the @entity40 drop zone , he has revealed his stark message to the players			2
‘ as i said to the players , it ’s quite simple			0

‘ with this club , this stadium , you can not play in the lower league			0
i think they realise how important it is			0
