@entity1 chairman @entity0 ruled out making a deal with @entity3 after the election @entity6 will not go into a coalition with @entity3 if his party fails to win a majority at the general election , it was claimed today			1
@entity0 , the @entity1 party chairman , publicly ruled out a pact with @entity13 ’s party , saying ‘ we are not going to do pacts and deals with @entity3			1
’ he conceded it would be ‘ an incredibly close election ’ , with the polls showing the @entity1 and @entity21 neck and neck and a high probability of another hung @entity25			1
the @entity26 have not ruled out another coalition with the @entity28 if they emerge the largest party , but fall short of the 326 seats required for an overall majority			1
but recent analysis suggests that even with the support of the @entity28 , who are set to lose around half their seats in may , they may still fail to win enough seats to form a government			0
@entity3 , who currently have two mps , could win as many as five or six seats in may , including one for mr @entity13 who is standing in the @entity1 - held seat of @entity43 in @entity44			2
mr @entity0 this morning gave a speech highlighting the ‘ chaos ’ which would come with a future @entity21 government , especially if it went into @entity46 with the @entity47 , who are expected to take at least a dozen @entity21 seats in @entity50			2
asked if he would rule out a @entity46 between the conservatives and @entity3 , he said : ‘ i can rule [ it ] out , we are not going to do pacts and deal with @entity3 , we are looking for an overall majority ’ he said the only poll which mattered was on election day , in 97 days ’ time , and said there would be many voters still undecided as the public tend to think about an election ‘ until the last ten days ’			1
‘ we have seen the polls close and i ’m the first to concede this is going to be an incredibly close election ’ he said			1
‘ with the @entity1 you know what you ’re getting			2
‘ you ’re getting a competent government who is serious about running the economy , serious about reducing the deficit and eventually producing a surplus			0
with any of the other choices , you are going to get a large degree of chaos			0
’ @entity77 today dismissed mr @entity0 ' claim that the @entity26 would not go into coalition or enter into a ' confidence and supply ' deal mr @entity13 said last year that he could form a tactical alliance with the @entity26 or @entity21 if his party wins a string of seats in may			1
under a so - called ‘ confidence and supply ’ deal , his mps could agree to support key measures such as the @entity91 , but the party would not enter into a formal @entity46 or hold ministerial posts			0
mr @entity6 has promised £ 7.2billion of tax cuts if he wins a second term – by raising the level at which people start to pay income tax from £ 10,500 to £ 12,500 and increasing the salary level at which people start to pay the higher 40p rate of tax from £ 41,865 to £ 50,000 by the end of the @entity25			0
the prime minister had suggested he would start to cut taxes in his first year , although the deficit will not be eliminated until 2018 at least			0
but mr @entity0 would not be drawn on this yesterday , saying : ‘ the commitment is by the end of the next @entity25 and the timing will of course be dependent on the economic performance of the @entity112 economy			0
’ but he added : ‘ it ’s absolutely do - able and i think we ’ve got the economic credibility to show we can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit in this @entity25 and in the next one			0

@entity1 chairman said ‘ we are not going to do pacts and deals with @entity3 ’
but @entity0 conceded it would be ‘ an incredibly close election ’
