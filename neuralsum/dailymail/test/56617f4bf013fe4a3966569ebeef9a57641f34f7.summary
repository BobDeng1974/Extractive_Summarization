@entity0 , pictured , is alleged to have sexually assaulted young men in the 1970s and 1980s in children 's homes in @entity4			1
his alleged victims could bring civil claims against him lord @entity0 - the @entity9 peer accused of molesting young boys in the 1970s and 1980s - could be tested by experts to prove he has dementia as part of civil claims brought by his alleged victims , a lawyer has said			1
the family of the 86 - year - old politician has been told he will not face child abuse charges because of his memory problems , but he could still face civil action from complainants			1
legal firm @entity22 are representing several people looking to take private action against @entity0 , with police having identified 25 people who say the @entity9 peer attacked them			2
each could claim up to £ 100,000			0
@entity0 has been accused of preying on young boys at three @entity30 care homes between 1969 and 1989 , with prosecutors arguing there is ' overwhelming ' cause to charge the former mp with 22 sex attacks on nine victims - the youngest aged just 10 at the time			1
@entity38 , head of the abuse team at @entity22 , told @entity40 at @entity42 newspaper that they were investigating the prospect of having @entity0 examined by third - party expert witnesses			2
' i have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that , ' he said			2
' it is something we could consider doing			0
it would depend on the detailed evidence that is available about his medical condition but , potentially , there is provision in the civil law for us to do that			0
' the director of public prosecutions @entity65 when she decided not to pursue the charges of historic sex abuse			1
she said there was ' no public interest ' in prosecuting @entity0 because of his dementia , adding that his illness made him unfit to plead - amid accusations of a 45 - year cover - up over his alleged actions			1
in the same month his @entity88 office was raiding by police the deeds to his £ 2million house were transferred to his children			0
lawyers are questioning the extent of his dementia ms @entity94 admitted that @entity0 should have been prosecuted on three separate occasions - in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 , but botched investigations each time meant he escaped a prosecution			2
the @entity99 has been accused of double standards , after a @entity102 investigation revealed that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010 , including 10 in the last year			1
@entity0 voted in the @entity106 210 times between his @entity109 's diagnosis and the end of 2013 , leading some to suggest he could have been prosecuted if authorities had acted sooner			0
his alleged victims will be seeking compensation if evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered			2
the family of @entity0 say he is innocent			0
however , this has been made more difficult since @entity0 transferred ownership of his @entity119 flat , estimated to be worth around £ 2million , in march 2014			0
the transfer took place in the same month that police raided the politician 's office in @entity88 director of public prosecutions @entity125 has come under fire for refusing to prosecute @entity0 after saying his dementia would make him unfit to plead - admitting he should have been prosecuted before @entity22 represents 168 of @entity129 's victims and 10 of former @entity131 mp for @entity133 @entity132			1
mr @entity38 said he believes it is ' outrageous ' that allegations of sex abuse are only being investigated now , adding that the transfer of @entity0 's assets would not put off the clients from pursuing legal actions			1
' the question i would ask is : if he actually has dementia , on what basis does he have the capacity to transfer ownership of assets ? ' he said			0
there appears to be a contradiction between saying on the one hand that ' he has dementia ' and on the other that he has been able to effect a transfer of assets			0
' if there 's evidence that the transaction has been done to avoid potential creditors that is something we could challenge			0

no *criminal* charges against 86 - year - old but alleged victims could sue
extent of *disgraced* peer 's dementia could be examined as part of cases
*veteran* politician accused of historic sex abuse dating back to 1969
