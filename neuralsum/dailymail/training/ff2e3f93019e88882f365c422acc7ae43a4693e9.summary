pacemaker implantation involves inserting a small battery - operated device into a patient 's chest , which emits regular electrical pulses that help to keep the heart beating regularly			1
the contractions of the heart muscle that pump blood around the body are triggered by electrical pulses			2
should those natural pulses be disrupted for any reason , resulting in an abnormal heartbeat or arrhythmia , a pacemaker may be fitted			1
common causes of arrhythmia include sick sinus syndrome , where the heart beats abnormally slowly , atrial fibrillation , where it beats abnormally fast , or a heart block , where the pulse that triggers the contraction of the heart muscle is either delayed or @entity1 is having a pacemaker implanted today the small metal box is attached to one or more wires - or pacing leads - that run to the heart			1
it contains a battery , pulse generator and tiny computer circuit that converts energy from the battery into electrical impulses which then flow down the wires and stimulate the heart to contract			2
the relatively straightforward implantation process is carried out under local anaesthetic , meaning the patient is awake throughout the procedure			0
typically the generator is inserted beneath the skin near the collarbone , and attached to a wire that is guided through a blood vessel to the heart			0
the procedure , which usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes , is one of the most common types of heart surgery , and most people are well enough to leave hospital the day after the surgery			0
