by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 the nation has n't reached a major tournament since 1976 , but the @entity3 finally have something to shout about with countryman @entity5 reaching the @entity7 final on tuesday night			1
barring injury , @entity5 will become only the fifth @entity9 to play on the grandest stage of @entity12 football after @entity13 came through 5 - 0 on aggregate against @entity15 at the @entity16			1
@entity13 can win their 10th @entity7 in @entity17 , but will the @entity9 shine ? here 's how the others fared ... off to @entity17 : @entity5 ( third right ) celebrates after @entity13 's first goal in @entity22 on tuesday night @entity24 - @entity23 , 1975 the @entity26 - born midfielder was in @entity28 's xi for the defeat by @entity15 in @entity30 in 1975 , and it did n't take long for him to make his stamp on the game			1
with the sort of challenge which would have you sent off four times over these days , @entity34 's fourth - minute attack on @entity35 was described by @entity40 as ' the most brutal foul i think i have ever seen			2
his leg was a mess , and it was eight or nine months before he could play again			2
' @entity23 lost 2 - 0 despite dominating the match , thanks to late goals from @entity48 and @entity49			0
stamp : @entity34 made his impact in the game early on with a thumping challenge on @entity35 @entity56 - @entity55 , 1984 , 1985 the deadly finisher was a winner in 1984 as @entity55 beat @entity59 on their own turf on penalties , with @entity56 slotting home @entity55 's third spot kick in a 4 - 2 shoot - out win			2
he was part of the team that won the 1981 final against @entity13 in @entity30 , but never made it into the match - day squad			1
he played in the 1985 final in @entity71 against @entity72 , remembered for the 39 people killed by a collapsed concrete wall after trouble in the ground			0
he went to @entity72 in search of more of the same with @entity79 clubs banned from @entity12 competition after @entity71 , but returned after just a season			0
victory : @entity56 ( back row , second right ) celebrates @entity55 's 1984 @entity7 final win over @entity59 @entity87 - @entity86 , 1999 , 2008 , 2009 and 2011 the most decorated @entity3 player of all time , the legend played a big part in both of @entity86 's @entity7 final wins , and both were as dramatic as they come			1
the wing wizard helped @entity23 get to the final with goals against @entity72 in the semi-final and three goals in the group stage , but it was his mishit in the final minutes at the @entity101 against @entity15 that lives longest in the memory			0
his hashed effort fell to @entity104 , who equalised for @entity23 before @entity106 's winner			0
in 2008 , he scored @entity23 's sixth penalty in a 6 - 5 shoot - out win over @entity109 in @entity110 , coming on as a substitute in the 87th minute			0
he lifted the trophy alongside @entity113			0
@entity114 became his nemesis , losing in the final in @entity117 in 2009 and then @entity118 in 2011			0
night to remember : @entity87 holds the trophy aloft with @entity113 after his second @entity7 triumph @entity121 - @entity55 , 1977 a two - time winner alongside @entity87 , @entity121 was victorious in consecutive years with @entity55 in the late 70s			1
@entity121 started at left - back in the @entity125 ' 3 - 1 win over @entity126 in 1977 in @entity117 , but was on the bench for the 1 - 0 win over @entity129 the following year at @entity118			0
a memorable banner was unfurled by @entity55 supporters in @entity117 read ' @entity132 , made the @entity133 , now he 's @entity134 ' in reference to beating @entity136 and @entity137 on their way to the final			2
jubilant : @entity121 celebrates the 3 - 1 win over @entity126 in @entity117 @entity5 - @entity13 could he be the best ? he has a long way to go to catch up with @entity87 in terms of medals , but @entity5 could easily surpass his @entity7 haul if this becomes the @entity13 side that finally lives up to expectations in @entity148			1
he 's scored five goals in @entity148 this term , and having scored the winner in the @entity153 earlier this month , the next step up is to grab the all - important goal in @entity17			1
the stage is set for the most expensive player on earth			0
at last : @entity5 ( background ) could be part of a @entity13 side winning their first @entity7 in 12 years			1

@entity5 's @entity13 take on @entity162 in the @entity7 final in @entity17
@entity5 will become only the fifth @entity9 to play in a @entity7 final
