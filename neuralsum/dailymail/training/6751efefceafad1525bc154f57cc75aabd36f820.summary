a draft from the @entity2 @entity1 may require porn actors to use condoms on shoots -- not too surprising for an industry laden with @entity8			1
a bill called @entity10 , which requires condoms on porn shoots by law , is currently stalled in the @entity14			1
however , the new 21 - page draft may also require actors to have sex during porn while wearing safety goggles			1
the @entity3 claims goggles will avoid semen from entering the eyes , a body part susceptible to diseases such as @entity25 and @entity26			2
safety goggles may be required on porn sets to prevent actors from getting @entity8 salon reports that according to @entity3 's deputy chief of health @entity35 , barrier methods such as condoms and eye protection are already technically required on porn shoots			1
few porn companies adhere to those standards			2
if the new guidelines are deemed mandatory , there may be a trial period in which actors can ditch the ' barrier method ' during oral sex			0
the safety rules would be reconsidered again in 2018 and either kept or discontinued			0
@entity47 reports that @entity48 is the only mainstream porn production company that requires condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse			1
@entity35 of @entity3 claims that condoms are technically already mandatory on porn sets but that almost no one adheres to the rules porn insiders are not thrilled with the new safety laws and some think the draft regulations are trying to rid the porn industry all together			1
@entity60 , ceo of the fetish site @entity62 told @entity30 that the draft regulations ' basically criminalize the production of porn			1
' he even told salon that he 's thinking of selling @entity62 's @entity68 porn palace named the @entity69			1
he said he 'd ' have to invest in a warehouse in @entity71 or @entity72 , ' to produce his porns			0
unfortunately , porns that use protective barrier methods during sex do n't sell as well as porns that do n't			0
one porn actress @entity78 told @entity47 , i would n't mind using condoms more			1
it 's just not what people want to see			0
' the porn industry started using condoms more after a 2004 @entity25 outbreak , but after porn sales went down , condoms came off , reported @entity89			2
the huffington post reports that @entity91 , a trade group representing the adult film industry , is opposed to laws requiring condom use because it may stop required @entity8 testing for actors			2
actors currently test every 28 days or more			0
while the draft guidelines do n't require regular testing , they do require that employers provide hepatitis b , hepatitis a , and hpv vaccinations to actors			2
the guidelines also require that studios , ' provide for post exposure prophylaxis ' and that they provide counseling			0
some porn actors are forced to pay for their own testing so the new law may alleviate some financial strain and force companies to take responsibility for their talent 's health			0
the draft also says that porn shoots will have to instill new post shoot clean - up requirements such as disposable materials and plastic coverings			1
on the one hand , the new law promotes health and safety to workers put in health - threatening conditions			0
on the other hand , the porn industry in @entity2 may die out all together .			0
