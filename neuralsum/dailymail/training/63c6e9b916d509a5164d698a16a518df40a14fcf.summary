bankruptcy behind it , @entity1 's atmosphere swirls with the promise of better days			1
@entity6 can only hope that the city 's good fortune trickles down to him and the 10 other residents of a tent city that 's sprouted in the shadow of a resurgent downtown where rental occupancy is close to full and restaurants and shops are doing brisk business			1
@entity6 and others in this makeshift community of seven tents — believed to be the only tent city in @entity1 — say they have nowhere else to go			1
' by us being out of bankruptcy , they can see that you got people out here that 's struggling , ' said @entity6 , 51			2

all told , about 16,200 of @entity1 's 680,000 residents — almost 2.4 percent — are believed to be living on the streets or in temporary shelters — and that does n't account for other types of homelessness , such as teens going from friend to friend and families living in motels			1
by comparison , only about 1 percent of @entity67 's more than 800,000 residents are homeless			1
but @entity67 is on much firmer financial ground than @entity1 , which shed $ 7 billion in debt during bankruptcy			2

like others sheltered only by layers of warm clothing beneath canvas tents , @entity6 ' hustles ' because he ca n't find a steady job			2
he accepts handouts and makes a few bucks directing fans into downtown parking lots before sporting events			0
he said he helped start the tent city about two months ago , with others joining later			1
camped out : @entity6 , pictured , @entity114 and others in this makeshift community of seven tents say they have nowhere else to go ' it 's quiet and you really do n't get bothered by too many people , ' said @entity6 , who also lives with his girlfriend and has been homeless for four years			1
he is n't a fan of the rescue mission : ' the last time i was there , i got bedbugs			0
hopefully , i can find a shelter somewhere that 's presentable and me and my girl can go and make a stay for the winter			0
' @entity131 , operations manager of the @entity133 's @entity132 , said his group has dropped off coats at the tent city that can be used as sleeping bags			1
