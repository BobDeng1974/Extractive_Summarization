by @entity1 reporter published : 17:18 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:32 est , 30 september 2013 after rooting out thousands of white - owned farms , @entity2 is now targeting ‘ foreign ’ trees for the axe			1
indigenous trees can stay , but firs , pines and eucalyptus that were planted by early white settlers to remind them of their distant homes are now being pulled up			2
but the policy has nothing to do with the politics of president @entity15 , or his black empowerment law meant to reverse the entitlements of the white - led rule of the past			0
alien : species such as the pine tree , above , are being uprooted by the @entity23 because they drink too much water in the rough : pine trees are popular with golf course designers who create wooded areas , as shown in this @entity31 course royal @entity33 club manager @entity32 said a program to cut down ' alien ' trees and replant trees ' indigenous ' to @entity2 such as the acacia and msasa varieties is under way , and will take 20 years to complete			1
so far , nearly 60 gnarled and elderly ' foreign ' trees have been removed and more than 300 local trees and shrubs have been planted in their place			2
foreign eucalyptus , or gum trees , most of them over 100 years old , are set for the chainsaw , said @entity32			1
' if we are to retain water , these trees need to come down ' @entity32 said			1
nearby pine trees also make the soil acidic and ' there is also the threat of falling debris from the old trees ' he said			2
the early settlers , mainly @entity59 , were homesick regions and golf gave them solace			2
they planted imported trees and shrubs in @entity65 , as @entity2 was known before independence in 1980			0
@entity67 , the queen ’s grandfather , played on the course in 1929 , bestowing the royal title on the club			1
but the last of the hardy , long - living foreign trees he saw are being cut down now			0
royal connection : the course took its regal name after @entity67 , above , played there the first settlers felled the indigenous trees on the course and wild animals that once roamed there disappeared too			1
experts have been called in for the replanting exercise that requires careful planning			0
every hole has trees planted in ways to make the game more challenging , according to @entity32			0
' a player has to contend with the trees if he hits the ball out of the fairway ' he said			0
the purple blossoming jacaranda tree , a native of @entity96 and @entity97 brought to @entity98 by early missionaries , will be spared at @entity33			1
it has become synonymous with @entity2 ’s ' spring ' season because it blooms at winter ’s end			0
@entity103 trees , a member of the local acacia species that grows in dozens of @entity98 varieties with different hues and shapes , are the indigenous trees of choice at the golf club			1
the course is home to more than 100 species of birds , many of which migrate thousands of kilometers to the southern hemisphere every year , he said .			0

' @entity120 ' trees suck up too much water , according to @entity33 golf club
the replanting *process* will take 20 years , course manager says
the @entity128 *'s* grandfather , @entity67 , once played at the course
