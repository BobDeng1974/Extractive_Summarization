@entity0 was facing a backlash within his own @entity2 today after softening his opposition to a new @entity5 treaty he vetoed last month			2
@entity6 confirmed that the work and pensions secretary @entity7 and @entity9 secretary @entity8 had both raised concerns at this morning ’s weekly @entity2 meeting about mr @entity0 ’s apparent change of heart in @entity14			0
the prime minister was also attacked by @entity17 leader @entity16 in the @entity18 this afternoon after he made a statement to explain why he has given the green light to the @entity22 countries using the @entity23 to police a new ‘ fiscal compact ’			1
objections : minister @entity7 , left , who led previous @entity27 rebellions over @entity5 , today objected to @entity0 's apparent @entity29 u-turn mocking mr @entity0 's claim he vetoed last month 's treaty , mr @entity16 said : ' with this prime minister a veto is n't for life , it 's just for @entity36			1
' updating mps on the latest @entity39 ( @entity29 ) summit , the @entity34 said the eurozone debt crisis was having ' a chilling effect ' on the @entity43 economy and he told the @entity18 : ' i went to the @entity39 last december prepared to agree a treaty of all 27 countries , but only if there were proper safeguards for @entity43			1
' i did not get those safeguards so i vetoed that treaty			0
' @entity50 scoffed with laughter as mr @entity0 continued : ' as a result , eurozone countries are now making separate arrangements outside the @entity29 treaties for strengthening budgetary discipline , including ensuring there are much tougher rules on deficits			1
' twenty - five of the 27 @entity29 countries agreed yesterday 's @entity14 deal , with just @entity43 and the @entity62 failing to opt in			1
distance : @entity0 and @entity63 were close last year , bottom , but were some distance apart last night ( top ) but mr @entity0 said the @entity43 would allow the institutions to be used to monitor the new rules , having previously said the @entity68 and the @entity23 could not have responsibility for monitoring deals agreed outside the full @entity29			1
today , the prime minister said the new agreement sets out new roles of the @entity68 and the @entity23 , adding : ' the new inter-governmental agreement is absolutely explicit and clear that it can not encroach on the competencies of the @entity29 and they must not take measures that in any way undermine the @entity29 single market			2
' we will watch this closely and if necessary we will take action , including legal action , if our national interests are threatened by the misuse of the institutions			0
' mr @entity7 , who led @entity27 rebellions over @entity5 in the @entity87 years , questioned the legality of the move , which mr @entity0 ruled out last month			2
mr @entity8 said the @entity29 should be focusing on improving trade and competitiveness rather than trying to force through new treaties			0
@entity27 @entity50 last night accused mr @entity0 of backtracking in order to ‘ appease ’ his @entity95 deputy @entity94 , who was infuriated by his tough stance last month			2
@entity27 @entity97 accused the prime minister of ‘ waving the white flag ’ – and compared him to mr @entity87 , whose government was torn apart by infighting over @entity5			2
the prime minister yesterday said he would now only block the move if @entity43 ’s national interest was directly ‘ threatened ’			0
but he pointed out that @entity43 remains outside the deal , which forces @entity22 countries to adopt tough austerity measures			2
labour leader @entity16 , who has refused to say whether he would have signed the treaty last month , said the prime minister ‘ seems to have sold us down the river on a lot of things ’			0
@entity114 compared the @entity115 to his predecessor mr @entity87 after he agreed eurozone countries could use the @entity23 to police the rules of their new fiscal compact to prop up the single currency			1
@entity43 diplomats have negotiated changes in the wording of the treaty which they believe will ensure that the @entity23 is not used to meddle with the single market , which @entity43 is signed up to			2
but the @entity27 leader in the @entity128 issued a withering press release after a meeting with the prime minister , saying he had no choice but to agree to the plans because mr @entity94 wanted the treaty to go ahead			0
in favour : deputy prime minister @entity94 has been an advocate of the @entity29 treaty @entity137 said : ‘ there is no doubt that the government ’s position has altered since the december summit			1
‘ i blame a combination of appeasing @entity94 , who is desperate to sign anything the @entity29 puts in front of him , and the reality that this pact is actually quite hard to prevent			0
’ today @entity16 said mr @entity0 lost the opportunity to defend @entity43 ’s interests in negotiations when he walked out of talks on the new treaty last month			1
mr @entity16 told @entity154 : ' if you walk away from the negotiating table , it is very hard to secure a good deal for your country			1
' he went into these talks saying his real worry was about financial services and how that would be affected if other countries went ahead			0
he has secured no extra protections for financial services			0
' mr @entity0 was monitored yesterday by a member of mr @entity94 ’s staff – a symbol of the distrust between the coalition partners on @entity5 after mr @entity0 ’s veto caught the deputy prime minister by surprise			0
@entity27 backbencher @entity97 said : ‘ we saw how popular @entity0 was in the opinion polls after he used his veto			1
we do n’t want @entity0 to go down the road of waving the white flag			0
‘ this will define whether he ’s seen as a @entity180 or a @entity181 , and i ’m afraid the comparison will be with @entity87			0
’ @entity27 mep @entity183 said : ‘ december ’s “ veto ” turns out to be nothing of the kind ; at best , it is a partial opt - out			1
@entity43 had asked for concessions in return for allowing the other member states to use @entity29 institutions and structures for their fiscal compact			1
‘ no such concessions were forthcoming , but we have given them permission anyway			0
’ privately @entity43 officials made clear that they think the fiscal compact is unwise and will lock smaller @entity5 countries in a @entity200 - imposed financial straitjacket			2
mr @entity0 received a small boost when the @entity62 decided not to back the fiscal compact , leaving @entity43 in a minority of two rather than one			1
@entity200 backed down yesterday over plans to impose a @entity14 economic commissioner on @entity207 to force it to cut spending .			0
