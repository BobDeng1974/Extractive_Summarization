by @entity0 a mother says she will have to take eight buses to get her four - year - old to a school located just two miles away			1
@entity5 , 38 , is unable to drive her son to school because she suffers from a brain condition , while her husband @entity9 , 42 , works full time			1
and she says the route to @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , which runs across fields and rivers , is too dangerous to walk			1
@entity5 , 38 , with son @entity16 , four , ( right ) and and @entity17 and sons @entity19 , four , and @entity20 , nine months , says she will have to take eight buses to school and back instead , mrs @entity5 , who works in shop , says she will have to take eight buses each day to take and collect her son @entity16 from school			1
the journey will involve catching the 168 and 189 from @entity26 to @entity27 , or the 410 and 168 from @entity26 to @entity28 to @entity27			0
mrs @entity5 , who works in a shop , said : ‘ it is going to be really difficult to get @entity16 up and ready for school in the morning - and it will mean his day lasts from about 7am to 5pm			1
’ she said she applied for @entity16 ’s place at @entity33 - where his siblings , father and grandfather went - early			0
the school is just a five - minute walk from her home in @entity40 , @entity26			2
the route shows the journey across fields and rivers from mrs @entity5 's home in @entity40 to @entity11			1
she had hoped to get a place at @entity33 so she was shocked when the council contacted her after the deadline date and told her she needed to submit her application			0
after sending what she says is a second application , she was told the bad news that @entity16 would n’t be able to attend the desired village school			0
she said : ‘ my husband works full time so he ca n’t do the school run and i am unable to get my driving licence because of my condition , which means i faint unexpectedly			2
‘ technically the school is only two miles away from our house , but that route means we would have to walk across fields and over a river			1
it just is n’t safe			0
‘ it could be really dangerous , especially in the winter as there is no public footpath or street lighting and if i had to go on my own to pick him up i would n’t feel safe			0
’ @entity5 , 38 , with son @entity16 , four , and her husband @entity9 , 42 , can not drive because of a brain condition @entity73 , deputy director of children ’s services for @entity76 , said there had been an unusually high demand for places in the area this year			2
he said : ‘ we are aware that a number of parents in @entity26 have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this			0
‘ this year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year			0
‘ we will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home			2

@entity5 has to take her son to @entity11
the @entity13 school is just two miles from her home , but she can not drive
walking means crossing fields and rivers
so mrs @entity5 , who works in a shop , will have to take eight buses
