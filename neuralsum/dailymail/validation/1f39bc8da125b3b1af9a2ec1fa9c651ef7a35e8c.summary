a bird that was long thought to have gone extinct has been rediscovered in @entity1 after a team of scientists used a recording of the species ' distinctive call to track it down			1
the @entity7 ( chrysomma altirostre altirostre ) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in @entity1 in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether			1
but a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in @entity1 's central @entity16 in may last year , according to their report published in the latest edition of @entity19			1
re-discovered : the @entity7 which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in @entity1 the scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along @entity1 's mighty @entity28 river , now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast @entity31 nation			1
at one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station , the team heard what they thought could be the babbler 's call			2
they then used a recording of a @entity7 from the @entity42 subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself			2
@entity45 , from the @entity44 , told @entity46 he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey , which was also carried out with members of the @entity49 and @entity1 's @entity50			1
' it was unbelievable , ' he recalled			0
' we played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds			0
like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them , they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call			0
' further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs			0
but researchers warned that the bird 's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on @entity1 's few remaining grasslands			1
' this discovery not only proves that the species still exists in @entity1 but that the habitat can still be found as well , ' @entity74 , director of @entity49 's regional hub in @entity76 , said in a statement			1
' future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them , ' he added			0
birds fly over the @entity88 in @entity16 , @entity1 , where @entity7 was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct @entity45 said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small , ' around 50 - 80 hectares ' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby			2
he added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in @entity101 , @entity42 and @entity102			0
his team now hope to conduct dna tests to decide if it is a separate species			0
@entity1 's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011			2
it has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country 's generals were			0
@entity1 has more species of bird than any other country in mainland @entity119 , with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted .			1

was last spotted in @entity1 in *1941,and* was thought to have died out
scientists used a recording of its distinctive call to rediscover species
@entity131 proves bird and habitat both still exist in @entity1
