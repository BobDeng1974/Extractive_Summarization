by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 18:56 est , 13 june 2013 @entity1 has blundered into controversy again – by flogging antiques from her free home in @entity5			0
the furniture is her own , but photographs of it in her @entity10 advertisements were clearly taken in the grace and favour apartments provided for her husband @entity13 , speaker of the house of commons			1
and it appears that buyers of 43 - year - old mrs @entity1 ’s unwanted stuff were invited into the houses of @entity5 to pick up their purchases			0
up for auction : @entity1 , the speaker 's wife , sold £ 1,600 of antiques in an @entity10 blitz just weeks before she was handed a £ 100,000 bill for libelling a @entity27 peer on @entity28 ad : this two - seat sofa auctioned by @entity1 went for £ 480 , and clearly shows the @entity32 carpets and grand fixtures			1
she also asked for collection in person from @entity36 controversial : @entity1 with her commons speaker husband @entity13 , whose @entity5 flat she was using as a backdrop for all the adverts a spokesman for the @entity42 last night made clear that none of the items sold by @entity45 and mrs @entity1 was @entity5 property , and insisted there were no security issues over buyers being invited into the @entity32			1
but keen observers of the misadventures of mrs @entity1 – nicknamed ‘ @entity53 ’ by her many critics – will be curious about her motives for suddenly selling ten pieces of furniture at cut prices to raise more than £ 1,600 in a two - week auction frenzy			1
she is certainly in need of ready cash			0
last month she disastrously lost a libel claim brought against her by @entity27 peer @entity62 , after she sent a tweet to her 56,000 followers falsely implying he was a paedophile			2
although she could have admitted she was at fault , she fought the case and lost , ending up with a bill for damages and costs thought to total more than £ 100,000			1
and even her 50 - year - old husband , with generous £ 142,000 - a - year pay , plus expenses , and without the need to pay for a family home , will struggle to cover that			2
the controversial £ 45,000 taxpayer - funded refurbishment of their apartment at the @entity81 four years ago may also mean that some of their own furniture had become redundant			1
mrs @entity1 has been a fanatical user of @entity10 for years – to a similar extent to fellow political wife and keen bargain hunter @entity87			0
those she has bought from and sold to offer almost universal praise in miss @entity91 ’s @entity10 ratings – although in march a seller offering a @entity95 light for £ 70 caustically said of her : ‘ fails to contact or complete sale			2
unreliable , @entity98 and pompous in her messaging ! the antique furnishings were put up for sale in april , shortly before she was hit with her libel bill			1
feedback : one customer was very keen to buy some of the furniture up for sale , but was left unhappy with the contact he had with mrs @entity1 @entity10 sale : speaker 's wife was selling items like this sofa on @entity10 weeks before she lost her high - profile libel case with @entity62 , which will cost her £ 100,000 grand : the @entity116 live in a grace - and - favour flat in @entity5 but it is not clear if buyers were asked inside to see the items they were buying auctions : all these items ( top left to bottom right ) were sold , including one piece she said was worth £ 2,250 but sold for £ 250 argument : the old oak items were auctioned by the @entity116 because they would ' not work ' in their new house mrs @entity1 was so eager to sell that she let an 1890 oak dresser go for just £ 250 – despite claiming than an antiques dealer gave it a valuation of £ 2,250			1
also sold for £ 480 was a @entity134 sofa , clearly pictured beside a grand fireplace in the @entity136 ’ @entity5 residence			0
she said in her @entity10 advertisements : ‘ i ’m selling lots of quality antique and period - style furniture			2
must be collected from central @entity142 , near @entity143			0
’ and mrs @entity1 also made a clear reference to the £ 935,000 six - bed 1980s @entity147 - side townhouse in @entity148 , south @entity142 , she and her husband bought in january			2
mrs @entity1 wrote that the : ‘ antique and period - style furniture just wo n’t work in the new , modern house we bought recently			1
’ the @entity116 are understood to have planned to let their modern @entity148 house for £ 5,000 a month – although westminster - watchers believe mr @entity154 fears losing his prestigious commons role after the 2015 general election			1
his fellow @entity27 are believed to have scant regard for him			0
@entity10 sellers have also told of how they have sold their own second - hand goods to mrs @entity1 , commenting that they were amazed to have her turn up at their homes in a rented van to collect her purchases			2
problems : lawyers for @entity27 peer @entity62 said he had suffered ' unnecessary pain ' as a result of the court case while mrs @entity1 said the litigation had been a ' nightmare ' - but she lost couple : mrs @entity1 is able to live in the @entity32 thanks to her husband @entity13 's job as @entity175 she has spent more than £ 4,000 on @entity10 since february			1
one surprised seller said : ‘ it was a bit surreal to have the speaker ’s wife standing in my hallway			0
’ last night a spokesman for the @entity32 said : ‘ the items sold by @entity45 and mrs @entity1 were their own belongings			0
‘ and there are no concerns about security , as all visitors to the parliamentary estate , including those to the @entity116 ’ home in @entity175 ’s @entity42 , undergo strict search procedures as a condition of entry and are restricted as to where they may go on the estate			0
’ the @entity116 had a £ 45,000 refurbishment of their @entity5 apartment within weeks of arriving there in 2009 , all at taxpayers ’ expense			0
tv appearance : @entity1 hugs former pop star @entity203 on celebrity big brother in 2011 , an appearance which her husband was said not to approve of prime postcode : the grand fixtures and fittings inside @entity5 gave away that the seller was @entity1			0

two - week blitz came just before losing £ 100,000 libel case to @entity62
flogged £ 1,600 of items using her husband 's commons flat as backdrop
but one @entity10 *member* called her : ' @entity98 and pompous in her messaging ! '
she was selling because items ' wo *n't* work in the modern house we bought '
*bercows* had purchased £ *1m* house and also bid for new furniture on @entity10
they deny asking buyers to collect items at @entity81 was security issue
