what are the chances of this happening ? you set up a time - lapse camera in the hope of getting some minute - by - minute shots of the ever - changing beauty of autumnal @entity7			1
instead , you capture the clearest snap ever taken of a giant , @entity11 - style beastie , so close you can almost see it smiling			1
add to that the fact the photograph was taken and tweeted by the firm that makes the clever automatic camera responsible for the shot , and it becomes a matter on which even a partial @entity35 jury surely would not be able to agree			1
yet there are some intriguing elements to this , the alleged first picture of @entity47 , the @entity49 version of the famed @entity11			1
it was taken on an @entity52 camera on a tripod at the @entity55 lake shore at @entity56			2
@entity57 , who provides photographs for the company , claims she wanted to get a sequence of nature and wildlife shots taken throughout the day			2
when the camera content was examined on wednesday , it appeared she might have got more wildlife than she bargained for			0
the dinosaur - like creature was apparently captured swimming or paddling into the distance before disappearing			0
‘ at first i thought it might have been a swan or a goose , as i was looking at the image quite small on my smartphone , ’ said @entity57 , 24			0
‘ i ’m open to suggestions as to what the creature could be – i ’m just glad i put the camera in the right place at the right time			0
’ yesterday the company said it had examined the images and insisted they had not been altered			0
a famous photo allegedly showing the @entity11 was taken in 1934 , but was later said to be a fake the legend of the creature attracts millions of tourists to @entity11 , @entity35 's second largest body of water @entity7 - the largest natural lake in @entity87 - is situated about 40 miles from the @entity35 border with tongue firmly in cheek , marketing executive @entity89 said : ‘ at first , we thought it was a swan or goose , or on closer look , a larger animal like a horse with a saddle pack or something			1
‘ whatever it is we will leave it to the experts			2
’ a spokesman for the firm insisted : ‘ it certainly looks real			0
it ’s ridiculous , but we ca n’t offer any logical explanation			0
’ he said the camera took shots every few minutes , so all the images were scrutinised to see if they revealed anyone putting something in the water or taking it out afterwards			2
but there was nothing – not even a sighting of @entity118 trying to lead @entity11 home .			1

*referendum* *campaign* has seen banks tell of plans to leave @entity35
now a picture taken at @entity7 appears to show @entity11 in the water
however , with vote next week , timing of picture is somewhat suspicious
