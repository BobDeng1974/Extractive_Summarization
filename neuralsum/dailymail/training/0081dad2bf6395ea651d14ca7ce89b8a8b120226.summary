one man carried out the vandalism while two friends looked on before they left the memorial lying on the pavement in @entity13 town centre			1
shortly afterwards an older man took it home			2
the culprits are likely to be ordered to apologise to relatives of the victims , while the plaque – which was recovered at the weekend when the alleged thief was arrested – will be put back in place at a ceremony			1
father 's anguish : @entity26 and his son on holiday , a year before @entity25 was killed at the age of 12			1
the plaque ( right ) put up in memory of @entity25 and the other victim @entity32 , 3 , was ripped down in a drunken prank there was outrage last month when the bronze memorial to two victims of the 1993 blast – 12 - year - old @entity39 and three - year - old @entity32 – went missing			1
but a breakthrough at the weekend after the release of @entity43 images led to its recovery and the arrest of the suspects			0
on saturday , police arrested a 57 - year - old man in the @entity50 area of @entity13 , where @entity25 ’s family used to live , and recovered the memorial			1
they also released photographs showing three young men hanging around the plaque on the night it vanished			0
shortly afterwards , the men handed themselves in and confessed that two of them , aged 27 , had stood by and watched while their 28 - year - old friend took it off the wall			1
bombing victims : @entity32 , aged three , and @entity39 , 12 , who were killed in the blast in @entity13 in 1993 he abandoned it on the pavement , before it was allegedly taken home by the 57 - year - old around 6am			1
the older man was released on police bail after being arrested for ‘ theft by finding ’ , while the 27 - year - olds , from @entity13 , were released without charge			1
@entity25 ’s father @entity73 , 65 , is being consulted on what action should be taken against the 28 - year - old from nearby @entity76			1
mr @entity39 and community representatives will also be consulted about whether the 57 - year - old should be prosecuted			1
it is the second time @entity13 memorials have been targetted			0
just last month , @entity82 @entity81 , 25,was jailed for 18 weeks after he was caught red handed trying to steal another plaque commemorating the @entity39 , @entity32 and the 54 people hurt in the @entity5 attack			1
the @entity13 bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in february 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the @entity93 town			0
stolen : this is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the @entity5 blast was placed in the second attack , @entity100 received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in @entity104			1
in the event , there were two blasts , in litter bins outside @entity109 and @entity110 , within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion			0
@entity32 was killed almost instantly and @entity39 was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine			1
more than 50 other victims were injured , with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass			0
the bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren			0
speaking after it was discovered missing , @entity39 's father @entity73 , 65 , said of the thieves : ‘ even if they are really hard up it is without any justification			2
blast : the scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a @entity109 store and a @entity136 's ‘ it really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters			0
‘ it leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in , in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered			0
they did not give a moment 's thought to the significance of what they had just stolen			0
’ his wife @entity161 , 54 , said : ‘ it ’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind			0
@entity25 and @entity32 had so much to live for and i wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought			1
‘ it is a sign of the times , i suppose , but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day			0
’ the bombings triggered a campaign for peace , with @entity39 and mrs @entity183 – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between @entity187 and @entity188			2
they set up a @entity190 in the town and played an active role in the @entity193 , for which mr @entity39 was given his obe in 2004			2
tragically , the parents of @entity32 never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast			1
@entity32 ’s father , @entity199 , 69 , died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days			2
memorial : this @entity202 runs down @entity203 , @entity13 , in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 @entity5 bomb blast the boy ’s mother , @entity207 suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son ’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart			1
the bronze plaque , which depicts the course of the @entity217 as it flows through the @entity13 , reads : ‘ the central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in @entity203 in 1993			1
young people helped the artist with the design work			0
’ @entity226 , @entity227 mp for @entity228 , said : ‘ this is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other @entity13 people who were injured in the bombing			0
‘ @entity13 is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it did n’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace			0
but these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves			0
’ @entity242 , conservative mp for @entity243 , said : ‘ i am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped			0
’ @entity245 was 22 when she and her 29 year - old fiance @entity246 were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb			1
they suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim @entity39 ’s mother , @entity161			2
there has been a rise in cases of criminals targetting war memorials , lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines for their scrap value			0
each year , at least 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen , worth an estimated of £ 800million			2
campaigner : @entity26 , father of @entity13 bomb victim @entity39 , with former secretary of state for northern ireland dr @entity268			2
he is pictured at a peace centre in @entity13 he set up after his son 's death			0
