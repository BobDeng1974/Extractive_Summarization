@entity0 has heaped praise on @entity3 's resilience after they produced a hard - fought away performance at @entity6 to take all three points			1
@entity9 ' side are now 10 games unbeaten in the @entity11 since a defeat to @entity13 in december , and @entity0 has been impressed with their desire to win			1
' it was ( a proper away performance from @entity3 ) , and a lot of that came from @entity6 , who forced and pushed them back , ' @entity16 's @entity0 said on @entity21 after the match			1
@entity3 are now 10 games unbeaten since the middle of december , when they lost to @entity13 @entity26 ( centre ) fires home to put @entity3 ahead early on in the match at @entity29 's @entity30 is perilous to stop @entity26 's opening goal , as @entity3 went on to beat @entity6 2 - 0 ' what i 've liked from @entity3 , today and midweek ( against @entity35 in the @entity36 ) , is that they were n't at their best in terms of how they 've played with this new system , but they 've fought and got a victory			1
they have n't played great , but they won			0
' in the last few months since that @entity13 game , when things changed - the system , the performances and the results - they 've been superb			0
the last two games they have n't been like that , but they 've won			0
that 's going back to the @entity3 i know when i played			2
every time they play , you think they 're going to keep it tight			0
' even more impressive , @entity3 's defence has been tight away from home			1
the @entity55 have not conceded a goal in the @entity11 away from @entity57 since the aforementioned defeat to @entity13 in the middle of december			2
@entity9 has taken his team to two points away from fourth place and the @entity63 @entity0 ( left ) and @entity64 were complimentary about @entity3 's performance ' when you do n't play well , you rely on your defenders , and i think that 's five clean sheets now , away ... the best since 1985 , ' @entity0 continued			1
' i ca n't believe they 've broken a defensive record and i 'm not involved in it ! 30 years we 're going back ; that shows how good it is , and i 'm not involved in it			0
' @entity79 was chosen in @entity3 's starting line - up for the game at @entity29 's ; a bold decision from @entity3 boss @entity9 , but one that paid off			1
former @entity83 striker @entity64 was alongside @entity0 in the @entity21 studio , and he was impressed by the 19 - year - old			1
@entity87 wheels away in celebration after netting @entity3 's second goal 15 minutes from time @entity91 struggled to get into the game , and was in the shadow of @entity79 , who impressed ' one of his mistakes , he got caught ball - watching , but he did his work really well , ' @entity64 told @entity21			1
' today he had an amazing performance			0
he was n't [ doing ] step - overs and nutmegs , but he showed maturity in the game at an early age			0
' he knew at one point that he needed to tuck in			0
it 's the way he did it , to show that he could cover his back three			0
he never gave up , he always worked hard for his team - mates , and that 's how you earn respect			2
@entity79 is a young player that @entity0 will have come into contact with at @entity3 in his final year as a professional			1
after joining from @entity116 in 2012 , the winger began his rise to the @entity3 first team , and @entity0 was also impressed with his performance against @entity6			1
@entity0 and @entity64 were impressed by the performance of @entity3 's 19 - year - old winger ( left ) @entity79 ( left ) takes the ball past @entity6 's @entity123 during the @entity11 match at @entity29 's ' i 'm not criticising @entity91 , but he 's a Â£ 20million signing and he had to come off because he was finding it difficult			1
this young lad 's ( @entity79 's ) understanding of the game ... a young wide player is the one player in football that a manager will always mistrust			2
he 'll always look at a big away game , and think " i 'll take the young wide player out "			0
' now , he 's playing in the wing - back position			2
the fact that he 's stayed on , and the other fella ( @entity91 ) has had to come off			0
it 's not about going forward today , he virtually played at right - back			2
his understanding is brilliant , and long may it continue			0

@entity26 and @entity87 *scored* as @entity3 beat @entity6 2 - 0 at @entity29 's to move two points from fourth place
@entity0 praised @entity3 's resilience , as they fought to victory
@entity0 and @entity64 were also impressed by @entity79
@entity3 are now 10 games unbeaten in the @entity11
