by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 26 june 2013 a gay immigrant who was jailed for eight years after a series of ' extremely violent ' attacks will not be deported because he is now straight			2
@entity4 successfully argued he should stay in @entity5 because ' his sexual orientation was transformed from homosexual to firmly heterosexual '			1
the @entity8 was sent to prison at @entity10 in @entity11 11 years ago for two counts of @entity13 after he lost control after a series of homophobic comments were made			2
changed man : @entity4 will not be deported after he went from gay to straight , despite being jailed at @entity10 ( pictured ) for eight years in 2002 but after his release from jail in 2007 he was no longer gay , and married a @entity5 woman and they had a child together			1
angry : @entity25 @entity24 said the decision by judges to allow the @entity8 to stay in @entity5 was ' perverse ' at the same time he applied for asylum , which was rejected because he had shown ' no remorse ' for his crimes			1
but after launching an appeal using @entity33 human rights rules , he successfully argued that being kicked out of the @entity5 would deny him the right to a family life			1
the @entity36 then appealed the decision but incredibly mr justice @entity38 backed @entity4 instead of the government , despite admitting his story that he went from gay to straight lacked credibility			2
@entity25 mp @entity24 has called it a ' perverse decision to allow a dangerous foreign criminal to stay in our country '			0
' as far as i 'm concerned the human rights rules and laws in our country and our judges are both as daft as each other , ' he said			1
' the combination of the two gives us these ridiculous judgements			0
' it is these cases that prove we need top scrap it			0
it seems that the only people who seem to use it are prisoners and illegal immigrants			0
' the @entity36 said cases like this one is ' precisely why we are looking to change the law in the new @entity68 this year '			0
excuse : foreign criminals have frequently used @entity33 human rights law to prevent them being deported it came as yesterday an illegal immigrant who was jailed for beating his children was told he can not be deported because it would breach his right to a family life			1
@entity77 , 49 , was sentenced to two years in prison for kicking and punching his two sons and a daughter			0
but an attempt by the @entity36 to have him deported following his sentence has been rejected because he is a changed man and now has a good relationship with the children he attacked .			0

@entity4 was jailed after attack *prompted* by homophobic *abuse*
@entity8 was released after four years and ' fell in love ' with @entity5 woman
also applied for asylum , which failed until he used human rights laws
@entity96 argued to judges ' his sexual orientation was transformed '
