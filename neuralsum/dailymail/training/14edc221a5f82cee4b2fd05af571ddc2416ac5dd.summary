she said : ‘ if mr @entity235 had been charged before as reported , it would be very unlikely that he would be sitting in a public place brazenly doing what he had been accused of ? ’ mrs @entity26 also found it hard to believe he would have been caught with child porn images because she knew him as such a skilled computer programmer			0
she said : ‘ all his work that i have seen him carry out previously was meticulously passworded			0
' i find it very hard to believe that if there were any pornographic images , as has been claimed , that he would be so naive as not have password protected them and made it very difficult to access especially in the circumstances described			0
’ mr @entity10 appears to have held down a number of different jobs , being variously described by locals as a web designer , it consultant and he once even helped to organise the launch of @entity141 ’s polo clothing range			0

‘ he ’s been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill he never paid			0
‘ he ’d fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in @entity6 when he was spending £ 50 a day on drink			0
‘ he was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money but i never saw him misbehaving			0
