@entity0 may be irritated about @entity2 's exhausting pre-season programme , but the @entity3 can thank his lucky stars that he is no longer manager of @entity5			1
@entity6 complained last week that his side 's commercial responsibilities in touring the @entity9 were ' not very positive preparation ' for a @entity12 season			0
but he may wish to spare a thought for some of his former charges			0
@entity5 's tour of the @entity9 looks set to be the most gruelling of the lot , with some of their players not even getting the chance to sleep on the tour			1
the club will play a friendly against @entity46 , and finish with a fixture against the @entity48			1
the latter being the headline attraction of the tour , @entity5 are not prepared to do without their big names , and have demanded that their @entity34 stars return from holiday to spend just one day in the @entity55			1
that means that the likes of @entity35 , @entity39 and @entity40 face a nightmare 34 hour trip			0
leaving @entity60 at 10am on wednesday 6th august , they will be back in the city by 8pm the following day			0
the players will arrive in the @entity9 , play the match , and leave for @entity60 again without so much as an overnight stop			2
of all the @entity34 latecomers , only @entity38 has been spared the gruesome round trip , but only by virtue of the fact that he is already on holiday in the @entity9			1
pre-season schedule : @entity72 will manage @entity5 against @entity46 and the @entity48 @entity48 with worries about @entity5 's usually poor @entity75 form , forcing an energy sapping trip such as this one on the players certainly seems rash			1
but just as @entity0 has found to his chagrin at @entity2 , the ' commercial activities ' of a club come before the welfare of the players in pre-season			0
for @entity5 , this summer is a huge opportunity to try and break the @entity9 market			2
they are set to open a new offices in @entity88 during the tour , and will be looking to capitalise on the @entity34 success of the @entity9 national team under former @entity5 player @entity92			1
there has already been one setback for @entity5 's pr machine , though , with chief executive @entity96 unable to take part in the tour , having been denied a visa			2
the @entity9 consulate in @entity101 has admitted that there is a „ global problem “ with the visa system at the moment			0
six of @entity5 's youth players have also been affected , and are now unable to join the squad as planned			0
@entity108 ready for @entity9 trip selfie time ! @entity27 looks on as a fan takes a photo of the @entity113 international at @entity60 airport			0

@entity5 set for gruelling tour of @entity9
@entity60 's @entity34 winners will return from holiday to spend just one day in the @entity55
@entity101 champions set to take on @entity46 and the @entity48 all stars
