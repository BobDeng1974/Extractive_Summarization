maybe it was that monotone @entity1 voice			2
maybe it was his bloke - down - the - pub approach to introducing @entity7 ’s coverage of live football			1
or maybe it was just the fact that he brought us the @entity13 from @entity14 last summer while wearing an unflattering pair of shorts on @entity17			0
the news that @entity19 has been rather unceremoniously dumped by his employers is unlikely to plunge the country into national mourning			1
@entity19 , who has been replaced as @entity7 's lead football host , pictured in west @entity24 on friday @entity19 sports shorts and flip flops while presenting @entity7 's live @entity13 coverage in @entity14 last summer at best , he was television @entity28			1
but the people who were turned off by his chummy — some would say irritating — style in the studio seem to be far greater in number than those who were n’t			1
essentially , @entity19 always appeared to lack what was required to carry off such a key role			1
he possessed neither the suave composure of @entity39 or the presence and professional input of @entity42			0
it takes more than a stint on @entity45 and @entity46 to achieve that			0
he took to jabbering at his expert studio pundits , oblivious to @entity50 ’s death stares and the fact that no - one was laughing at his jokes or cared in the slightest that he supports @entity55			0
former @entity56 midfielder @entity50 ( centre ) left @entity7 prior to last summer 's @entity13 in @entity14 @entity58 and @entity19 both work for @entity59 , with @entity19 being handed an expanded role last summer there is nothing wrong with trying to establish a rapport with your guests and viewers , but @entity19 seemed to want a little too much of the limelight			1
his move from the @entity59 to front @entity7 ’s coverage of @entity71 football and @entity73 internationals in 2010 always felt like a bad plan , not least because it briefly exposed us to his replacement @entity77 on @entity78			2
@entity77 found a new home and no doubt @entity19 will as well			2
he will be back and we should wish him well until then			0
after all , far worse crimes have been committed on our television screens in the name of sport			0
and as the 47 - year - old follows his fellow @entity87 departees @entity88 and @entity89 into the studio sunset , all we ask is that he takes those shorts with him .			0

@entity19 leaving @entity7 is unlikely to plunge country into mourning
people were turned off by his chummy and irritating presenting style
he also seemed to want a little too much time in the limelight
