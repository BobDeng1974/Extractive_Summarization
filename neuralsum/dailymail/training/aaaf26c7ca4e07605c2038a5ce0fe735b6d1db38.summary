by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 and @entity4 captain @entity3 was sensationally sent off for the first time in his career as the @entity7 were held to a dramatic draw by @entity9 in a pulsating derby at @entity11			1
@entity3 was shown a red card for an uncharacteristic headbutt on @entity9 full - back @entity14 eight minutes from the end of a tense and keenly - fought match , with his side leading 24 - 18			1
@entity9 took advantage of the extra man to score an equalising try through loose forward @entity23 two minutes later and , although both sides failed with late drop - goal attempts to break the deadlock , that is the way it stayed			1
seeing red : @entity3 walks after being sent off at @entity11 the point was enough to take @entity2 back to the top of the @entity31 but the talking point was the dismissal of @entity3 , who was awarded the mbe in the @entity35 for services to rugby league			2
two opportunist tries from second rower @entity39 were the highlight of a high - tempo game that flowed from the first whistle and was marred only by referee @entity45 's insistence on over-use of his video assistant			2
@entity9 drew first blood through skipper @entity49 , touching down after his winger @entity50 had palmed the ball back from @entity53 's high kick , but a knock - on from the re-start by winger @entity55 put his side under pressure			1
@entity7 scrum - half @entity58 had a try ruled out by video referee @entity61 before the home side struck with two tries in quick succession			1
right winger @entity65 outjumped his opposite number @entity50 to touch down @entity68 's towering kick before substitute forward @entity69 scored with his first touch after left - wing pair @entity72 and @entity74 had both kept the ball alive superbly from @entity3 's kick			0
@entity55 made amends for his earlier error by creating the space for former @entity2 second rower @entity80 to go over for an equalising try and the visitors would have been back in front but for some heroics by @entity86 , back from a five - match ban			0
first the full - back pulled off a trysaving tackle on @entity14 and then forced a handling error from @entity53 over the line			0
it seemed which ever side had the ball were destined to score and @entity39 was the next to do so , forcing his way past a trio of defenders on a solo run to the line and juggling with the ball before grounding it			0
@entity3 kicked his third conversion to make it 18 - 12 but the scores were tied once more seven minutes before the break when @entity9 substitute @entity106 proved unstoppable from 10 metres out to score his first try of the season with his first touch			1
there was no let - up to the action in the second half as play continued to swing from end to end			1
@entity2 were indebted once more to @entity116 after he halted a break by @entity9 's livewire hooker @entity118 and they were relieved to see @entity50 's try disallowed by @entity61 for obstruction in the build - up by @entity49			1
when it was the @entity7 ' turn to attack , the ever - dangerous @entity74 was twice bundled into touch by @entity125 at the corner and prop @entity127 was held up over the line. , @entity2 had another escape when @entity23 could only get his finger tips to the ball from @entity49 's kick and they were in luck when @entity39 scored his second try to regain the lead on 58 minutes			2
@entity74 's grubber kick on the last tackle rebounded off @entity125 and @entity39 twice hacked the ball forward before diving on it just centimetres from the dead - ball line			0
@entity3 's fourth goal restored his side 's six - point lead and his drop - goal attempt that would have made the game safe was charged down			0
it was to be @entity3 's last contribution as he was dismissed for his rush of blood , but there was no end to action			0
two consecutive penalties enabled @entity9 to pile on the pressure and it paid off when @entity23 took @entity157 's pass to charge through a gaping hole in the @entity2 defence			2
@entity53 kicked his fourth goal to tie the scores and @entity162 and @entity53 both failed with one - point attempts to win it .			0

@entity4 skipper shown red card for a headbutt
@entity9 *snatched* a draw in the final minutes
the score was level at 18 - 18 at half - time
