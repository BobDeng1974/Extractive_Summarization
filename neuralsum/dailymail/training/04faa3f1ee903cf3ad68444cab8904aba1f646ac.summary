the four - month ban imposed on a senior @entity2 official for making a sexist remark to a female referee has once again exposed the outrageously lenient treatment given to former referee @entity6			1
@entity2 vice-president @entity7 was suspended by an @entity2 regulatory commission after telling referee development officer @entity9 : ‘ a woman ’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field			1
’ may , the partner of the @entity16 ’s youngest referee , @entity15 , had asked @entity7 about the possibility of officiating in the @entity18			0
@entity6 was slapped on the wrist and attended a diversity training programme for his racist comment @entity7 told her she ‘ would n’t be able to handle it ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s nothing against you personally but all the time i ’m alive , a woman will never referee in my league			1
’ in contrast @entity6 , who remains chairman of the @entity2 referees committee and is on the @entity33 referees committee , was just slapped on the wrist and told to attend a diversity training programme after telling black @entity2 colleague @entity36 : ‘ you look rather tanned , have you been down a coal mine ? ’ it is understood @entity7 plans to appeal against his sentence and will cite the way the @entity2 handled @entity6 ’s racist comment			1
some on the @entity2 council claim there is one rule for a high - profile figure such as @entity6 and another for those lower down the @entity2 pyramid			2
the @entity2 say no - one complained after the @entity52 incident , so it was dealt with in - house , while a complainant in the @entity7 case led to the setting up of a judiciary panel			2
the most likely outcome from monday ’s @entity59 task force meeting on the dates of the @entity61 is a recommendation for november and december			2
there is no chance of @entity33 ’s january - february preference winning acceptance after @entity59 president @entity67 and @entity69 president @entity68 agreed that the @entity61 must not impact on the @entity70			0
and a @entity61 in april / may will not be much cooler than a june tournament			0
@entity67 ( right ) is set to agree that the @entity72 in @entity73 should be played in november / december @entity74 are notorious for cheerleading over their key rights coverage — when does gushing host @entity78 ever admit to showing a really bad @entity16 game ? so it ’s a worrying new development that the five - year extension to @entity74 ’s @entity83 rugby autumn international series contract also includes a top - level sponsorship of the @entity85			1
no surprises that @entity88 ’s trigger - happy owner @entity87 took commercial advice from @entity90 , director of trading at @entity91 , which went into administration with the feared loss of 2,400 jobs			0
meanwhile , @entity97 ’s rash promise to @entity88 fans that he would buy back @entity100 from @entity102 property developer @entity101 for £ 15m has hit problems over raising a bank mortgage			0
scalpel blunted by @entity61 @entity110 , having appointed former @entity107 ceo @entity106 as their commercial chief , are expected to join @entity107 , @entity111 and @entity112 in following the @entity114 ‘ scalpel ’ approach of dividing up sponsorship opportunities around the world			0
but the @entity114 blueprint does not necessarily work for a national governing body — the @entity2 are still looking for an @entity121 sponsor despite having brought in @entity122 , former global sales manager at @entity123 , at the start of the year to help apply @entity114 techniques to secure it			1
the @entity2 are still looking for a sponsor for the @entity121 , which @entity112 won last season in their fight against the secondary online ticket market , which is already offering @entity133 seats at vastly inflated prices , @entity129 2015 have produced a clever video apparently showing @entity136 in familiar knees - bent , hands - clasped penalty kick pose			1
the figure turns out to be someone who ca n’t kick a rugby ball , with the message : ‘ it ’s not always easy to spot a fake			0
’ accountants @entity146 , who have made their reputation in the sports industry with their annual football rich lists based on turnover — the financial reality is actually far more complex — are predicting a @entity155 @entity154 franchise would be worth £ 102m a year to the @entity155 economy.but that figure can only have been plucked out of the air when it is not known when or if @entity155 will field an @entity154 team .			0

@entity6 was given a slap on the wrist for his racist comment
but @entity7 has been banned for four months for a sexist remark
the @entity61 in @entity73 in 2022 set to be held in november / december
the @entity2 are struggling to find a sponsor for the @entity121
