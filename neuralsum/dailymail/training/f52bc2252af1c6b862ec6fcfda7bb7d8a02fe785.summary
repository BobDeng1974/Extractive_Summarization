' we know our clothes affect other people 's impressions of us , ' professor @entity68 told the @entity73			1
' now research shows what we wear affects us too			2
' putting on different clothes creates different thoughts and mental processes			0
' my book aims to make people more aware of this , to understand how changing their clothes can change their mood and their thoughts			0
' in the study , she gathered a group of students and asked some to wear a superman t - shirt			1
she wanted to know if heroic clothing would change how students thought			0
surprisingly , she found that not only did it make them more confident , but it also made them actually think they were physically stronger			0
‘ when wearing a @entity27 t - shirt the students rated themselves as more likeable and superior to other students , ’ she explained in a release from the @entity14			1

this and other research *appears* in her new book mind what you wear
