a defence of his crown will be a priority for @entity6 hero many clouds next season , and trainer @entity8 has also floated the possibility of a rematch with his @entity12 conqueror @entity13 in @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
that race in november has already been identified as a likely target for @entity19 and , even allowing for a rise in his handicap mark , many clouds would receive weight from his rival			2
with 11st 9lb on his back , @entity26 ’s mount carried the biggest weight to victory on saturday since @entity30 won his second @entity6 in 1974 at under 12st			1
many clouds , winner of saturday 's @entity6 , is shown off during a parade in @entity34 on sunday fans line the streets to pay their well - wishes to the @entity6 winning horse has @entity39 finally found his nemesis in @entity41 ? @entity42 , a @entity44 supporter , and @entity45 have had a regular bet on whose team will finish highest in the @entity48			1
@entity8 , who ensured the retiring @entity39 did not sign off with @entity6 glory , said : ‘ we have had double or quits , but i have never had to give him anything ! ’ @entity8 ’s desire to return to the @entity55 — the 2014 @entity14 winner who also came sixth in the @entity14 — rather than prioritise the @entity14 , is influenced by the fact that with a weight ceiling of 11st 10lb , the gelding will have to carry only an extra pound			1
@entity8 said : ‘ he has nothing to lose by going for the @entity14 as there is no point me protecting his handicap mark over hurdles			2
but , having said that , and having seen all the novices that @entity72 has , we might just train him for the @entity6 and if @entity13 goes for the @entity14 , it would be a very interesting option			2
’ the training centre of @entity34 in @entity74 was packed on sunday to welcome its first winner of the £ 1million @entity77 ’s - sponsored race since @entity79 ’s @entity78 20 years ago			0
among the well - wishers at @entity41 ’s @entity82 stable , where 1938 national winner battleship was trained , were flat trainers @entity85 and @entity86 as well as @entity8 ’s brother @entity87 , best known as one of the jockeys to ride the great @entity90			2
@entity26 , the first to ride back - to - back winners on different horses since the 1950s , having landed the race 12 months ago on @entity94 , was in action at @entity96 , where he was unplaced in one ride , but @entity99 owner @entity98 , who also owns the @entity101 and @entity102 , as well as a third @entity6 winner that he bought for only € 6,000 ( £ 4,350 ) , flew in by helicopter from his @entity106 home			1
many clouds held his nerve over the closing stages ahead of @entity39 who was riding @entity110 winning jockey @entity26 ( left ) and @entity111 owner @entity98 ( right ) celebrate after victory the resurgent @entity8 , eighth as a jockey on @entity115 in @entity117 ’s @entity116 , had saddled four previous national runners but none had finished			1
he joked : ‘ my record was s * * * — it could only get better			0
’ fifth - placed @entity121 will also be looking to return to @entity122 next year , but not , of course , his jockey @entity39			0
he is expected to return to action at @entity125 on wednesday and now has only 11 possible racing days until he retires after @entity128 ’s seasonal finale meeting on april 25			0
one of the most memorable sights at saturday ’s race was @entity131 becoming a temporary flag man to help wave the field around the @entity134 on the second circuit			0
@entity136 , who was down on the landing side of that fence , suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung but was showing good signs of recovery on sunday			0
@entity26 , right , celebrates after winning the @entity6 horse race aboard many clouds @entity8 celebrates a victory for @entity146 and has already turned his attentions to next year two horses died at the meeting , @entity149 ’s seedling on saturday and @entity153 ’s @entity152 winner @entity150 , was put down on sunday because of injuries sustained in a fall in friday ’s @entity158			1
but a third @entity6 with no fatalities since the fences were given softer cores is proof that welfare changes have made a difference to the track			0
that is underlined by the fact that in that time , in all races over the fences , there have been 395 runners and only one horse has suffered fatal injuries as a result of a fall .			0

trainer @entity8 already has one eye on the 2015 @entity6
many clouds romped to success at @entity122 in saturday 's big race
and the winning horse is in ' @entity182 ' , according to @entity8
