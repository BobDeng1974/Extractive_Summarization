and now scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of why the small burrowing rodents put on such a noisy and enthusiastic show that sees them throwing their paws in the air with a squeak			2
black - tailed prairies dogs use ‘ jump - yip ’ displays that resemble a @entity3 wave to gauge how reliable their neighbours are at looking out for predators and to stop them being eaten , according to new research			1
in the display , the rodents jolt upright , throw their heads back and paws up while making a ' wee - oo ' sound in the display , the rodents jolt upright , throw their heads back and paws up while making a ‘ wee - oo ’ sound			1
biologists at the @entity34 , @entity35 , said the animals , which are native to the grasslands of @entity38 , use the displays to work out how responsive their neighbours are to the threat of predators , such as crows , hawks and coyotes			2
the burrowing rodents create mounds ( pictured ) which they use as look - out posts			0
scientists had thought that the ' jump - yip ' display was an elaborate ' all clear ' signal , but professor @entity51 and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around professor @entity51 from the department of biological sciences at the university , said the animals are effectively testing the levels of vigilance of their colony and adjust their behaviour according to how much they can rely on their neighbours ’ awareness of potential predators in their environment			1
the displays are contagious , resulting in a ripple of ' jump - yip ' movements he also said the displays are contagious , resulting in a ripple of ‘ jump - yip ’ movements			1
‘ this fits beautifully with work on primates , including humans , which suggests that contagious displays – like yawning – provide a window into the mind of others , suggesting of course , that species probing the minds of others are aware that they are distinct from those individuals			0
that is to say , they are consciously aware , ’ professor @entity51 said			0
‘ prairie dogs foraged less when individuals were less responsive to their jump - yip display , suggesting they use jump - yips to actively probe the awareness of their neighbours , ’ he added			1
before this study , published in @entity101 , scientists had thought that the display was an elaborate ‘ all clear ’ signal , to tell a colony it is safe from predators			1
but professor @entity51 and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around			0
now the team ’s research claims to have resolved decades of speculation as to what function these unique visual and auditory displays serve among prairie dogs			0
the findings suggest another way that sociality allows animals to forage effectively in the face of high predation risk , taking into account not only the number of individuals above ground within their social group , but their current state of awareness , professor @entity51 explained .			0

prairie dogs jolt upright , throw their heads back and paws up while making a ‘ wee - oo ’ sound known as a ' jump - yip ' display
some scientists *previously* claimed the *combination* of sound and movement was a signal to tell the colony it is safe from predators
