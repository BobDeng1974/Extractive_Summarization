under the @entity6 plan , which @entity7 could change , the active - duty @entity2 would shrink from its current 522,000 soldiers to between 440,000 and 450,000			1
that would make it the smallest since just before the @entity1 entered @entity4 in 1940			1
the proposal is based around both spending concerns -- as well as president @entity14 's promises to end two different long - term military campaigns			1

" the @entity2 is not standing still			0
the @entity2 is doing many , many , many things in order for us to shape the future environment and prevent conflict around the world			0

" but he has also said that we have to face the realities of our time			2
we ca n't escape tough choices			0
he and the chiefs are willing to make those choices , " @entity61 said .			0
