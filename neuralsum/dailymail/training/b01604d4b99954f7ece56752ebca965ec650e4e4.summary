@entity1 's transfer dealings may extend into @entity2 for the first time this january , although the @entity5 boss was bemused by suggestions he is about to bring an @entity7 to east @entity8			1
the @entity5 ' squad is the only one in the @entity10 made up entirely of @entity12 and @entity13 players , with @entity1 previously acknowledging the club did not have the scouting network in place to cast their net on to the continent			1
that changed last month when former @entity20 and @entity22 scout @entity21 was hired to take up the role of @entity12 and international scout as one of last season 's promoted clubs bid to adapt to life in the top flight			1
@entity5 boss @entity1 is considering the possibility of dipping into the @entity2 transfer market @entity5 's squad is made up of @entity12 players - including @entity35 and @entity36 ( pictured ) @entity1 brought in eight @entity12 and @entity13 players during the summer transfer window ' it 's well documented we were behind the curve with regards the recruitment system , ' said @entity1			1
' we had one but we were n't going into @entity2			2
now we are venturing over there			0
' that does n't mean we are going to sign anyone but we are beginning to get the background and trying to get depth of knowledge that 's needed in recruitment			0
' but there 's no guarantees ; they do n't just grow on trees out there			0
' there 's this misconception that you go into @entity2 and there 's thousands of players who are all brilliant for the @entity10			1
' we still have to define the ones that are right , we still have to align them with the team and what fits the team moving forward			0
' while branching out into those avenues could see a host of new players linked with a move to @entity72 , @entity1 scoffed at the one potential new recruit who was suggested as a possible target			2
@entity75 has been linked with a move to @entity72 but @entity1 revealed he did not know the player @entity75 , a 20 - year - old attacking midfielder plying his trade in @entity79 , was mooted as a player @entity5 were keen on this week , which came as a surprise to @entity1			1
' who is that ? that 's news to me , ' he added			0
' it would be highly unlikely that ( our scouting ) goes that far afield			0
we 're starting off building a base in @entity91 , going into @entity2 as the first marker and if and when there 's time to go beyond that , we 'll see			2
but certainly not at the moment , no. ' @entity1 baulked at the fees commanded by @entity12 - based players over the summer and there could be a chance that he taps into a market which may offer cheaper alternatives when the transfer window reopens			1
that could prevent him from finding the same frustrations as he found last summer , with the @entity5 manager knowing january bargains will be hard to find closer to home			2
' the @entity12 market has been a lot more unpredictable and a lot higher than it has been historically , ' @entity1 said			1
' it 's always been thought of as higher than going into @entity2 , which is why there are so many players from further afield coming into the @entity91 game , particularly at the @entity10 level			1
we 've found that it has been very , very tough			0
' i ca n't see it going backwards			0
with the new tv deal , everyone tells me that 's going to go up			0
there 's every chance the fees , contracts , wages , will go up in turn			0
it 's a tough challenge for us as a club			2

@entity5 's squad is made up entirely of @entity12 and @entity13 players
@entity1 could tap into @entity2 market after bringing in new scout
