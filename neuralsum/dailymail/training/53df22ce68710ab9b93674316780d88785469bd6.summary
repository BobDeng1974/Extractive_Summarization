seventy years ago today @entity1 's first front - line jet fighter - the @entity22 - took to the skies at the height of the @entity4 almost 4,000 @entity5 were built and they were exported to serve with countries around the world the @entity22 was the @entity26 ’ first operational jet , with sorties starting in july 1944 with @entity28			1
designed by @entity30 , the prototype took off in secrecy from @entity32 in @entity33 on march 5 , 1943			0
meteors were first based at @entity35 in @entity36 but were soon moved to @entity37 in @entity38 , closer to the action above occupied @entity40 and ready to intercept the dreaded @entity42 @entity41			0
the aircraft was quickly sent up to combat the menace of v - 1 flying bombs , pilotless pulse - jet projectiles that were the forerunners of today ’s cruise missiles			2
they were fired from the continent to later crash to earth over southern @entity51			0
with a top speed of more than 400mph , @entity5 notched up their first ‘ kills ’ of v - 1s in august 1944			2
initially created as a single - seater , pilots used to piston - engined , propeller - driven aircraft had to quickly get to grips with their new @entity11			1
many aircrew would be instantly taken by the lack of the spinning propeller they were used to seeing at the front of their spitfires and @entity68 fighters			0
they were also amazed at the quieter engines – at least from the cockpit ; the noise outside being deafening to bystanders			0
by 1949 dual controlled @entity11 were being produced which enabled flying instructors to ease the transition from propeller to jet aircraft			1
by the end of the war 16 @entity79 squadrons were equipped with @entity82 and soon after the @entity84 version was flown , which was 170mph faster than its predecessor			1
by 1951 there were 20 @entity79 squadrons flying the @entity22 and it became one of the best - loved aircraft in the air force inventory			1
by the end of the war 16 @entity79 squadrons were equipped with @entity82 and soon after the @entity84 version was flown , which was 170mph faster than its predecessor legendary post-war test pilot @entity100 , in his memoirs @entity97 , described his first impression of the new jet fighters as a poor one , saying the low - powered early variants ‘ often seemed touch and go whether they would take off or not ’			1
but he grew to appreciate the aircraft ’s qualities as it developed into a fine flying machine			0
' after the noise of orthodox ' planes , they seemed to slide through the air in an uncanny , effortless silence , ' he said			2
for a short while after the war @entity117 's @entity11 were the best - performing aircraft in the world and were an export success , being ordered by air forces across the globe			1
@entity100 described it as a ‘ wonder plane ’			0
‘ it had the fastest speed and climb , the best manoeuvrability , and the highest ceiling of any production aircraft in the world , ’ he said			0
today only a handful of @entity11 remain in airworthy condition			1
one is flown as a trials aircraft by @entity1 firm @entity138 , which makes ejection seats for airforces around the world			0
another flies in @entity144 two are looked after by the @entity19 , at the @entity19 museum			1
besides its @entity150 training machine , the museum formerly known as @entity147 when based at @entity148 operates a rare nf.11 night fighter which was one of the first vintage jets to be flown in private hands			0
@entity19 , which operates as a charity , is due to open its doors to the public on good friday , march 29			1
it will be the biggest visitor attraction to open in the south west since the @entity160 in 2003			0
refuelling @entity11 aircraft at @entity162 in @entity163			2
by 1951 there were 20 @entity79 squadrons flying the @entity22 and it became one of the best - loved aircraft in the air force inventory boasting 25 aircraft , some of its aeroplanes are regular attractions at airshows across @entity1			1
some will be available for paying passenger flights			0
group captain @entity176 , the chief executive of the @entity19 said : ‘ @entity179 is one of the most iconic of all @entity1 aircraft and paved the way for generations of jet fighters			2
here at the @entity19 we operate the last flyable example of the @entity187 as well as a two - seat @entity150 trainer variant			1
the aeroplane was built in 1949 , making it the oldest flyable @entity1 jet in the world			2
’ @entity193 , chairman of the @entity194 , explains the charity was set up in 2012 to ensure the continued operation of the @entity11 and several other classic @entity1 aircraft in the skies over the @entity1			2
he said : ‘ keeping meteors and other survivors of this era flying is our key objective			0
it is vital that these aircraft are not lost overseas and can be an inspiration to future generations of pilots and engineers			0
they really are the last link to an era when @entity1 ruled the skies			0

4,000 @entity11 were built and exported to serve with countries around world
this month one of last @entity11 still in airworthy condition will take to the air
will mark opening of museum at @entity19 - formerly @entity79 @entity20
