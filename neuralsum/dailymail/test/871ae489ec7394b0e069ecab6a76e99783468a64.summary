a resurgent @entity0 sees no reason why @entity2 can not win this year 's formula one world title race			1
following a torrid campaign with the team in 2014 , @entity0 finally has a car to his liking at @entity2 this season , with the @entity9 looking far more like his old competitive self			1
only qualifying issues have denied @entity0 better results so far this term , with the 35 - year - old knocking on the door of his first podium place for 19 months after finishing fourth in the last two races			1
@entity0 finished fourth at the @entity18 in @entity19 on sunday @entity2 have proved more competitive in the first three races of this season than they were last year at the @entity18 on sunday , @entity0 was reeling in team - mate @entity22 and may well have claimed third but for a late safety car			1
although @entity22 and @entity0 were comfortably adrift of @entity25 duo @entity24 and @entity26 at that stage , the @entity9 is confident @entity2 can catch and regularly beat their @entity29 rivals			1
' i do n't see a reason why not , ' said @entity0			1
' we have made big gains and we will continue to make big gains during this year			0
' obviously everybody will improve , so it depends what the rest are doing , but we are definitely going the right way and doing the right things			0
' it is about being patient			0
we need time , we can not make miracles overnight			0
@entity22 finished on the podium for the third time this season at the @entity18 ' @entity22 showed we can win ( in @entity47 last month ) , but it depends as one circuit may be better for one team and the next could be a different story			1
' we just need to be up there when something happens to them , or the conditions change , but i really feel on speed we will get there to regularly beat them			0
' @entity0 recognises , though , he needs to do better in qualifying on saturday if he is to thrust himself into the hunt for the title			2
an error at the @entity64 resulted in @entity0 starting sixth , and although he passed @entity66 duo @entity65 and @entity67 on lap one , he could do no more			2
@entity0 sees no reason why @entity2 can not challenge for the title this season ' after my mistake fourth was more or less maximum , ' added @entity0			1
' i probably could have tried ( to pass @entity22 ) at least , but there was a safety car at the end			2
it is what it is			0
' after what happened on saturday we at least gained some positions and we had a pretty good car			0
' but we are not happy			0
we have to make saturdays more correct as it gives you bigger chances and an easier life in the race			2
' it does n't help when you put yourself in a more difficult position for the race , especially one where it is never easy to overtake			0

@entity2 finished *disappointing* fourth in the *constructors* ' *standings* in 2014
they improved this season and are second to @entity25 after three races
@entity22 won the second race of the season in @entity47 last month
@entity0 sees no reason why @entity2 can not challenge for the title
