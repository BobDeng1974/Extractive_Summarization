by @entity0 a scientist struck down by malaria seven times is leading the search for new drugs - to stop transmission of the deadly disease			1
dr @entity8 , of @entity9 , has completed what she describes as a ' herculean study ' into the roles played by enzymes as the malaria parasite develops in the body			1
dr @entity8 , born and brought up in @entity17 , @entity18 , said : ' this latest study identifies how protein phosphatases regulate parasite development			1
dr @entity8 , of @entity9 , has completed what she describes as a ' herculean study ' into the roles played by enzymes as the malaria parasite develops in the body ' our research provides a systematic functional analysis for all the 30 phosphatases in @entity31 - the parasite responsible for causing malaria			1
' these enzymes work in tandem with the protein kinases identified by the same team in a complementary study carried out in 2010			0
' dr @entity8 , who now leads her own malaria research laboratory at @entity9 , added : ' if we can find out what proteins are essential for these parasites to develop and divide , maybe we can target those proteins and arrest them with drugs or vaccines			1
' malaria remains one of the most deadly scourges of the developing world - killing up to one million people and causing disease in 300 to 500 million people every year			1
in humans the deadliest form of malaria is caused by the single cell parasite plasmodium falciparum			0
disrupting the life cycle of the malaria parasite could save the lives of millions of people			0
malaria parasite development and cues controlling it is still not fully understood			0
what dr @entity8 ’s team is trying to do is understand the basic developmental biology of these parasites			2
dr @entity8 ’s new research was carried out in collaboration with the @entity73 ’s @entity72 ( @entity74 ) in @entity75 , together with colleagues at @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity75 and @entity79 in @entity80			2
malaria remains one of the most deadly scourges of the developing world - killing up to one million people and causing disease in 300 to 500 million people every year			1
pictured is a red blood cell infected with malaria dr @entity88 , head of the @entity89 , said : ' inhibitors of protein kinases are already used in treatments for other diseases and there is growing interest to develop phosphatase inhibitors as drugs			0
' identifying the key kinases and phosphatases in the parasite life cycle will define the targets for drug development to treat human malaria and prevent its transmission in communities by the mosquito			0
' dr @entity8 added : ' interestingly , out of the 14 genes that could be knocked out , six were found to be crucial for sexual development and hence could be drug targets for parasite transmission to and from the mosquito			2
' the race to uncover new vaccines and more effective drugs to treat disease and block malaria transmission is becoming ever more important			0
' @entity117 , professor of @entity118 and director of research in the @entity120 at @entity9 , said : ' despite being a small research group , @entity8 ’s lab packs a powerful punch and they are really putting @entity124 on the world map for malaria research			2
' dr @entity8 's findings have been published in the journal @entity129 and @entity130 .			0

dr @entity8 had malaria seven times as a child while living in @entity17 , @entity18
she is now leading the search for new drugs to stop transmission of disease
research *focuses* on role played by enzymes as parasites develop in body
disease remains one of the deadliest in the world killing a million a year
