' the equipment brought in to reduce the risk of breakdowns broke down itself			0

' there was a sequence of small events that escalated in the way that they did			0
' the quality of information that was provided to passengers was not adequate , he admitted			0
ms @entity95 added : ' the cumulative effect was massive disruption which affected thousands of people over a very busy holiday period			0

by the evening of @entity6 the project was already six hours behind after new equipment dsigned to prevent breakdowns failed			2
failures : poor planning , equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the @entity6 train chaos , including a crush at @entity40 ( pictured ) , a @entity1 report found the @entity1 report said last week : ' the equipment failures were unexpected , due to the provision of new hardware that had been bought specifically to reduce the risk of breakdown			1
' however this new hardware had not been tested in the railway environment before deployment , and t not reliable when put to use			0
' services which did manage to run on december 27 that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed , while suburban @entity40 station failed to cope with the crowds			1
some services were ushered into @entity23 by staff waving red and yellow flags			1
@entity1 admits that there was no choice but to send passengers to the ' entirely unsuitable ' station at @entity40			1

" any other decision would have caused even more discomfort for passengers			0
" meanwhile at @entity39 's @entity26 station , while the physical work was completed on time , safety validation work that should have taken two hours instead took ten			1

the bonus could have been as much as Â£ 135,000			0
