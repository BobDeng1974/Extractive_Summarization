@entity1 secretary @entity0 maneuvered one of @entity4 's richest liberal philanthropies into contributing $ 13 million to enroll @entity4 , a group founded by a former @entity8 @entity7 staffer to drive up insurance enrollment numbers under the @entity10			1
a report issued monday by the @entity12 shows what @entity14 members of @entity16 ave anticipated learning since 2013 : that @entity0 called a total of five organizations a year ago and urged them to help @entity20 reach its goals			1
one call went to the ceo of the @entity24 , which made $ 3 million and $ 10 grants to the group after hearing her request			1
that amount was a dramatic increase from the $ 150,000 it had contributed the previous year			2
the foundation , known for bankrolling gun - control , diet - control , anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco campaigns , improbably insists that that the decision to award the money was ' not made in response to the secretary 's call			1
' @entity41 ( @entity42 ) stood alongside a smirking @entity8 on april 11 as her successor @entity43 ( r ) was presented to the public			0
@entity0 allegedly pressured corporations and one philanthropy into donating to a @entity48 group founded by a former @entity7 aide @entity20 president @entity51 ( c , in yellow , shown at a 2013 ' get covered ' event ) was the @entity7 's deputy chief of public engagement , and the @entity56 's deputy executive director , before leading the @entity10 cheerleading group dr. @entity58 , president and ceo of the @entity24 , made $ 13 million in commitments to enroll @entity4 after a phone call from @entity0 @entity0 also asked the tax - preparation giant @entity62 for funds , but that company decided against giving			1
three more calls from @entity0 went to @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 – all companies @entity70 regulates			2
the independent @entity12 report concluded that @entity0 sought ' nonfinancial support ' from them for @entity20 , ' such as technical assistance			1
' @entity76 sen. @entity75 told @entity77 that ' @entity0 ' shake - down of the very health companies her department regulates is a gross abuse of government power			2
' ' after putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in @entity10 spending , ' said the hard - charging @entity14 , ' a full investigation is needed to account for all the money wasted and the need to fundraise from the health industry			1
' others in the @entity91 had equally harsh words			0
' i have said all along that @entity10 is a complete disaster , ' @entity94 @entity93 rep. @entity93 told @entity77			2
' now we learn it ’s so bad that @entity98 attempted to solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up			0
' @entity93 pointed to @entity10 alternatives like the @entity104 , a @entity91 - sponsored alternative plan that he called ' patient - centered ' and ' market - based			2
' ' the evidence could n’t be more clear that @entity10 just does n’t work , ' he said			2
@entity91 sen. @entity111 's office was more biting , with spokesman @entity112 writing that his boss ' hopes that the next secretary of @entity70 will not ask the entities she regulates to support the president ’s allies			0
' @entity0 is on her way out after a lackluster @entity10 program launch and a series of missteps that included meltdowns in front of congressional committees			1
her successor , current @entity7 budget chief @entity43 , is expected to be confirmed in may			0
but @entity0 has clung to the assertion that she has always had the legal authority to ask for donations to outside groups that support president @entity8 's agenda			0
' @entity10 is a complete disaster , ' said @entity131 rep. @entity93 , complaining that @entity0 had to ' solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up ' enroll @entity4 ? @entity10 hit the march 31 finish line with a contested bit of good news , but spent most of its first six months in the @entity140 's version of after - school detention @entity0 ' tenure at @entity70 was marked by flailing performances before @entity16 and a tendency to underperform in her role as @entity10 's quarterback			1
@entity70 's office of general counsel told @entity0 in february 2013 , @entity12 wrote , that she was permitted to ' encourage members of the public to support certain organizations assisting @entity4 to enroll ' in @entity10 coverage			1
the written legal advice , which stopped short of saying she had the authority to pressure corporations or private foundations , came after her call with the @entity24			0
snark : a spokesman wrote @entity161 sen. @entity111 ' hopes that the next secretary of @entity70 will not ask the entities she regulates to support the president ¿ s allies ' @entity0 dismissed the idea last year that she was shaking down organizations to help a politically favored nonprofit			2
' if they felt pressure , they misunderstood , ' she told a @entity172 in june 2013 , according to the @entity173			0
' i ca n't answer what they felt			0
' she also insisted that she ' could legally solicit funds from anybody regulated by our office , ' but claimed – in contradiction to monday 's report – that ' i chose not to do that			0
' in 2013 @entity70 officials told @entity16 that @entity0 was the only federal government employee to solicit money for @entity20			1
but according to monday 's @entity12 report , @entity7 deputy assistant for health policy @entity187 teed up the conversation for @entity0 with a @entity24 employee in 2012			1
@entity12 reported that the foundation said @entity187 ' estimated that @entity20 or other similar national enrollment organizations would likely need about $ 30 million to finance a national outreach effort ' for @entity10 enrollment			1
' @entity24 told us that the official also indicated a hope that @entity24 would provide a significant financial contribution to support such efforts , ' but did not name a specific price tag			0
months later , with the @entity8 administration 's permission , the foundation 's ceo announced the $ 10 million grant to enroll @entity4 during a @entity7 meeting of liberal foundation executives			1
' the @entity24 also committed more than $ 834,000 in 2010 and 2011 to create @entity20 , which spun off from the progressive @entity208			1
in 2012 @entity209 deputy director @entity51 left the administration to become @entity20 's president			0
she was previously the deputy executive director at the @entity56			0
it 's this sort of revolving - door politics , practiced on both sides of the aisle , that has @entity14 lawmakers steamed			0
' the conflict of interest is hard to avoid , ' said @entity76 rep. @entity220 , addressing @entity0 ' approach of companies she was in charge of regulating			0
' our government and government officials should be held to a higher standard than this , and the @entity4 people deserve better			0

*outgoing* health secretary insists she was legally authorized to ask businesses she regulated for help with funding for @entity20
*republicans* are upset about the appearance of *ethical* *impropriety*
