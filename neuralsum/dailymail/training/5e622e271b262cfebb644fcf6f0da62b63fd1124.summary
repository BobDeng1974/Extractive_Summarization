justice should not be this expensive			0
so i thought we will fight this for everybody - it 's not just for me , i 'm doing it for you			0
i do n't want anybody ever going through this			0

i really lost my ability to focus and concentrate			2
i did not know what the book was about anymore , ' @entity3 said			1
