@entity0 would have left @entity1 with a warm - tingly feeling yesterday			1
it had nothing to do with the mid-march sunshine , however			0
it was because of @entity8 striker @entity7			1
this clash was billed as a straight shoot - out between @entity12 strike hopefuls @entity7 and @entity14 frontman @entity13			1
@entity7 celebrates as he takes his tally to 26 in all competitions so far this term @entity7 heads past @entity18 to give @entity8 the lead over @entity14 at @entity1 @entity12 manager @entity0 was at the game to cast his eye of @entity12 's next generation of strkers @entity13 reacts after missing an opportunity during the @entity26 derby on saturday @entity27 @entity7 24 16 @entity13 25 15 @entity28 28 12 @entity29 24 10 the @entity8 striker won the battle at a canter			1
that 's not a slight on @entity35 , who also would have impressed @entity0			2
but when the @entity12 manager names his squad for the games against @entity41 and @entity42 on thursday , in @entity7 he has a striker who has every hallmark of an international footballer			2
for @entity35 , the jury is still out			0
@entity7 was , essentially , the difference between the two teams at @entity14			2
it would n't have come as surprise to @entity14 boss @entity50 , who played an influential role in nurturing the striker in the @entity54 academy			0
@entity8 striker @entity7 celebrates as his goals keep @entity8 in the hunt for a top four finish @entity14 star @entity13 is denied from adding to his impressive goals tally by a save from @entity61 @entity14 striker @entity13 watches as his shot beats @entity61 only to crash off the crossbar ' he has polished himself , i was fortunate to have worked with him , ' said @entity50			1
' would i pick him for @entity12 ? yes , i would - but the way i 'm going ... ' two goals against @entity14 took his tally for the season to 26			1
that 's a record you simply can not ignore			0
the only question for the @entity12 manager now is if he utilises the striker in the @entity75 qualifier against @entity41 or ease him in during the friendly against @entity42			0
his first goal against @entity14 showed great bravery , risking a hefty blow to the head to glance home @entity82 's free kick			2
his second showed great composure , skipping round @entity86 before finishing into an empty net			0
but his goals only tell part of the story			0
@entity7 's heat map ( right ) in the opposition half showed he posed a greater threat than @entity35 ( left ) twice he showed excellent vision to set up marauding right - back @entity97 with goal scoring opportunities , executing both passes with unerring accuracy			1
had it not been for @entity18 's heroics in @entity14 ' goal , @entity7 could easily have had four by the time @entity106 blew the final whistle			1
after yesterday , @entity0 will be chomping at the bit to get his hands on @entity7 later this month			2
@entity7 doubled @entity8 's lead in the second half after rounding the keeper to slot into an empty net click here for all the stats from the game , including @entity7 's second goal ( below ) @entity35 has the good grace for congratulate @entity8 keeper @entity61 for his saves the @entity12 boss , perhaps , wo n't be as eager to draft @entity35 into his plans			1
this was by no means a poor display from the @entity14 striker , who himself could easily have had four goals himself yesterday			0
likewise , his goal line clearance to deny @entity128 spoke volumes for his desire and work rate			0
but @entity7 won this battle of the future @entity12 strikers			1
he won it hands down			0
@entity13 's time may come			0
but the time , for @entity7 , has arrived			0
