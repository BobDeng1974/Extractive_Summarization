marine biologists are working to uncover what caused several thousand @entity3 squid to wash ashore along the @entity5 shoreline on sunday			2
thousands of squid carcasses are littering the 12 mile stretch of coastline from @entity9 to @entity10 , where the high tide may have had something do to with the sea creatures essentially committing mass suicide			1
the general public is advised by scientists not to touch or eat the squid , as they may contain dangerous toxins			1
thousands of @entity3 squid washed up on @entity5 beaches sunday in a mass stranding that is a mystery to marine scientists the general public are advised not to touch or eat the squid as they may contain dangerous toxins scientists including @entity27 believe the squid may have consumed toxic algae @entity27 , a graduate student at @entity31 ’s @entity30 , told @entity34 ’s @entity33 affiliate that she saw people trying to put the squid back in the sea , only to watch them return to the beach			1
‘ they do n’t see the shore very often , ’ @entity27 said			0
‘ so it might just be that they do n’t understand what ’s going on around them , and they ’re just trying to get away and do n’t realize that if they swim towards the shore , they ’re going to run out of water eventually			0
’ scientists from @entity31 said the squid were predominantly juveniles as adult @entity3 squid can grow up to six - feet long and 100 pounds			2
they added that the squid were probably conceived and born in @entity55 , but were unable to navigate their way out to open waters			0
tests have shown that the stranded squid were well - fed from feasting on smaller market squid and cannibalizing each other , which is normal behavior for the creatures			0
sunday ’s phenomenon marks the third squid stranding in the past six weeks , from @entity5 to @entity67			1
marine biologists are currently analyzing the contents of the animals ’ stomachs to see if they ingested something that might have disoriented them			0
one theory under consideration is that the squid were disorientated after consuming toxic algae			1
‘ it is possible that the squid are ingesting these zero toxins or getting them through their food which is causing them to be disorientated and swim unto the beach , ’ said @entity27			2
thousands of squid carcasses are littering a 12 mile stretch of coastline from @entity9 to @entity10 sunday 's phenomenon marks the third squid stranding in the past six weeks scientists have found traces of domoic acid , a toxin produced by algae , in some of the beached squid , but the findings are so far inconclusive			1
@entity3 squid have not been observed in the @entity55 waters for a few years , making recent events all the more suspicious			0
some scientists attribute the phenomenon to this year ’s @entity101 weather patterns , which could have attracted them to the cooler climates of @entity103 and @entity105 ’s coast			0
conservation of the @entity3 off the coast of @entity105 is not a major concern because the squid can reproduce in mass numbers			0
the conservation of the @entity3 squid is not a major concern as squid reproduce in mass numbers video : squid carcasses wash up on @entity5 beaches			1

a 12 mile stretch of @entity5 coastline is littered with squid carcasses
scientists believe the squid may have become disorientated after consuming toxic algae
the public is advised not to touch or eat the squid
this is the third such stranding in the area in the past six weeks
