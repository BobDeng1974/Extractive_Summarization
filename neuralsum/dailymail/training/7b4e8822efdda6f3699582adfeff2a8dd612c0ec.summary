you may have noticed that the voices of politicians seem to change as they rise up the ranks			1
now scientists claim that being in a position of power can fundamentally change the way you speak and other people can pick up on these vocal cues			1
they say that the cues - such as talking more loudly with less variation in pitch - tell people who is really in charge , regardless of what an individual is saying			0
here , @entity23 , who famously underwent voice coaching , is pictured ‘ our findings suggest that whether it 's parents attempting to assert authority over unruly children , haggling between a car salesman and customer , or negotiations between heads of states , the sound of the voices involved may profoundly determine the outcome of those interactions , ’ psychological scientist @entity25 of @entity26 said			2
dr @entity25 and her team had long been interested in non-language - related properties of speech , but it was former @entity45 prime minister @entity23 that inspired them to investigate the relationship between acoustic cues and power			0
‘ it was quite well known that @entity23 had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative , powerful persona , ’ she explained			0
‘ we wanted to explore how something so fundamental as power might elicit changes in the way a voice sounds , and how these situational vocal changes impact the way listeners perceive and behave toward the speakers			2
’ to find out , dr @entity25 , @entity63 , also of @entity26 and @entity64 of @entity65 , designed two studies			0
in the experiment , ' high status ' individuals tended to make their voices go up in pitch slightly			1
powerful people had more monotonous voices without as much variety in pitch as more lowly workers			1
their voices also varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low - power roles			2
generally speaking , powerful people speak louder than others			1
the study found that listeners naturally pick up these cues to work out people in positions of authority			2
in the first experiment , they recorded 161 college students reading a passage so they could record their natural acoustics			0
the participants were then randomly assigned to play a specific role in a negotiation exercise , according to the study , published in the journal @entity97			0
students assigned to a ‘ high rank ’ were told to go into the negotiation imagining that they either had a strong alternative offer , valuable inside information , or high status in the workplace			1
alternatively , they were also asked to recall an experience in which they had power before the negotiation started			0
low - rank students , on the other hand , were told to imagine they had either a weak offer , no inside information , or low workplace status , or they were asked to recall an experience in which they lacked power			0
the students then read a second passage aloud in character , as if they were negotiating with an imaginary adversary and their voices were recorded			0
all the students involved in the experiment read the same opening , which allowed the researchers to examine acoustics fairly , because the contents of the passage remained the same			0
powerful individuals ( exemplified by @entity129 ) tended to go up in pitch in the experiment , as well as become more monotonous in tone			1
they also varied more in volume than the voices of people acting as less powerful people in the experiment comparing the first and second recordings , the researchers found that the voices of students assigned to high - power roles tended to go up in pitch , as well as become more monotone - with less variable in pitch – and varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low - power roles			1
‘ amazingly , power affected our participants ' voices in almost the exact same way that @entity23 's voice changed after her vocal training , ’ said professor @entity64			2
while @entity23 's voice got deeper overall thanks to voice coaching , the researchers told @entity161 that it got higher pitched in ' power situations '			1
' that is different from a voice being generally high or low pitched , ' they explained			0
' or to put it another way , even if speaker a 's voice is generally lower pitched than speaker b 's voice , both speakers can increase their pitch to the same degree in a high power situation			2
' and the students ' vocal cues did n't go unnoticed			0
a second experiment with a separate group of college students revealed that listeners , who had no knowledge of the first experiment , were able to pick up on these power - related vocal cues to determine who did and did not have power			1
listeners ranked speakers who had been assigned to the high - rank group as more likely to engage in high - power behaviours and they were able to spot whether a speaker held a position of power or not , with ‘ considerable accuracy ’			2
echoing the findings of the first experiment , listeners tended to associate higher pitch and voices that varied in volume , with powerful people			1
they also associated louder voices with higher power			1
‘ these findings suggest that listeners are quite perceptive to these subtle variations in vocal cues and they use these cues to decide who is in charge , ’ professor @entity64 said .			0

scientists from @entity26 in @entity211 claim that being in a position of power can fundamentally change the way you speak
they say people easily pick up on these vocal clues too
experiment found that powerful people have more monotonous , higher pitched voices than people with less powerful roles
high status individuals ' voices also tend to be louder , the experts said
