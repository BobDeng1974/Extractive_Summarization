by @entity0 many people will know the familiar nag of ' when are you going to find yourself a nice partner and settle down ? ' but most would simply shrug it off			1
one woman however grew so tired of being pestered about settling down that 14 years ago she decided to fabricate her own family			1
@entity8 has been photographing her imaginary life with mannequin husband and mannequin child - from proposal , to wedding , to family holidays - ever since			1
the @entity16 photographer , 42 , presents her work in a funny , thought - provoking and undoubtedly challenging picture series called the playing house project : life once removed			1
she was sick of people 's unrealistic expectations from herself and from life in general - but in particular that of women and marriage			1
' people said : " you 're such a nice girl , why are n't you married ? " she writes			1
' no one actually used that out of date word , but , what they were driving at was that i was a " spinster " , and i got tired of hearing about it			0
even my mother must have thought she was setting me straight when she said : " @entity48 , there 's nobody perfect out there			1
you just need to pick somebody , if you 're going to settle down " ' i snapped back , ' @entity52 ! it 's not like i can go out and buy a family ! i ca n't just make it happen ! " but then , i found a way			0
i bought a beautiful family â€¦ of mannequins			0
i decided to start a photo project out of the @entity60 i 'd capture with my new @entity61			0
' @entity8 gets up after sleeping in on a lazy sunday morning , beside her imitation husband as part of her 14 year self - portrait photo series @entity8 enjoys a @entity67 breakfast at @entity68 with her imitation husband while on holiday ( l ) and in front of the @entity71 , with her imitation family @entity8 was raised in the @entity73 in @entity74 , which made a lasting impression			1
it provided her first experience in the idealisation of family , and the glorification of the role of women as mother and homemaker			1
these influences have come together in shaping the focus of her subject matter			0
the external pressures of culture , and the internal pressures she placed on herself to fit into the expectations of that culture , built up over time , until she decided to do something about it			0
the artist employs satire and importantly humour in her work , because she feels that it is crucial to the digestion of what might be perceived as a ' bitter pill of social criticism '			1
' my own home was the backdrop for the first images , ' she explains			0
' over the next decade , scenes of an idyllic home life eventually extended into a series of holiday greetings , as a satirical response to annual family photo cards			1
however , the project took a turn after taking them on a road trip			0
i saw the potential in shooting in public			0
' seeing me work with the mannequins is such a peculiar and funny thing to witness , that people are immediately disarmed			2
as soon as that happens , their mind is open and impressionable			2
' using humor , paired with shock , allows my message to penetrate , and the work can have greater impact			0
the aim is to get people to reconsider their stubborn allegiance to traditional life expectations			1
' @entity8 poses with her imitation husband for a mock wedding portrait outside of a local chapel ' the term perfect is no longer used to describe what we 're all striving to be			1
now it is called fulfilled , ' she says			0
' but for women , the path to fulfillment is not through one thing , it 's through all things ; education , career , home , family , accomplishment , enlightenment			2
if any one of those things is left out , it 's often perceived that there 's something wrong with your life			2
' we are somehow never enough , just as we are			0
even if we do have a finger in each of those pies , there is never enough time to do any of them to our satisfaction			0
we are constantly set up by our expectations to feel as though we are missing something			0
' i thought it was high time to call this nonsense out publicly , because this notion of insufficiency is not just about me , nor exclusively about women in regards to marriage			2
it 's about anyone whose life does n't look the way it " should "			2
' rarely does anyone 's life turn out the way it was expected , and if by some miracle it does , what they expected is n't what they thought it was			2
' i 'm simply trying to get people to open up their minds , and quit clinging to outdated assumptions of what a successful life looks like			1
i want people to lighten up on each other , and themselves , and embrace their lives for who it 's made them , with or without the mrs. , phd			2
or @entity201 attached to your name			0
' in a moment of crisis @entity8 reunites with her imitation family for their annual holiday photo , after a trial separation in @entity210 @entity8 bends to kiss her imitation daughter goodnight			1
her project @entity212 is a satire of the the image of a ' @entity216 '			0
