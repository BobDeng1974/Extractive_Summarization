by @entity1 reporter published : 05:40 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 30 august 2013 the lives of @entity6 agents may have been put at risk by a @entity10 journalist ’s possession of top - secret documents stolen from the @entity13 government , a senior @entity3 adviser has warned			2
documents seized from the reporter ’s boyfriend , @entity15 , were so sensitive that agents have since had to be moved to protect their lives			0
@entity19 , deputy national security adviser at the @entity20 , went on the record to warn that ‘ lives may be put at risk ’ if the documents fall in to the wrong hands			0
mr @entity26 was registered blind after suffering two strokes			1
his walking stick is slightly reflective , which is why perhaps members of the public mistook it for a weapon court papers released yesterday also revealed the incredibly lax security used around the material , with mr @entity15 apparently carrying a password for some of the computer documents written on a scrap of paper			1
security sources also said that , as a result of the theft , codes for tens of thousands of sensitive documents have had to be changed			0
details of the chaos caused at the highest levels of @entity6 ’s security and intelligence agencies by the leaks emerged in official court submissions about material seized from mr @entity15 , the boyfriend of @entity10 journalist @entity54			1
mr @entity15 , 28 , who is @entity55 , was detained at @entity56 on august 18 as he passed through the airport on his way from @entity59 to @entity60			1
he was found to be carrying nine hard disks and memory sticks including secret files leaked by former @entity65 analyst @entity64 , and was questioned for nine hours before being released			0
mr @entity15 ’s detention under terrorism powers provoked outrage from civil liberties groups			1
but the newspaper ’s initial story described him only as mr @entity54 ’s boyfriend , and made no mention of the fact that he was carrying secret material or that the @entity10 was paying for his flights			2
despite only decrypting one third of the material , police have already discovered 58,000 classified documents , many marked secret or top secret			2
mr @entity26 was walking down the street on his way to meet friends when he was attacked			1
he was handcuffed by police before they realised their mistake he received treatment at hospital shortly after the incident in a statement to the @entity89 , mr @entity19 said the material was likely to contain details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks , personal data about agents at home and abroad and ‘ other intelligence activities vital to @entity6 national security ’			1
the release of the information could pose a ‘ direct threat to the life of @entity6 government employees ’ , as well as threaten the lives of their families			0
mr @entity19 warned the judges – who granted additional powers to the police to examine the classified material – that the information that had been decrypted ‘ has had a direct impact on decisions taken in regard to staff deployments and is therefore impacting operational effectiveness ’			1
he wrote : ‘ the material seized is highly likely to describe techniques which have been crucial in life - saving counter-terrorism operations , and other intelligence activities vital to @entity6 national security			0
the compromise of these methods would do serious damage to @entity6 national security , and ultimately risk lives			0
’ a police officer demonstrates the @entity128 stun gun which releases 50,000 bolts of electric current when fired he added : ‘ a particular concern for @entity132 is the possibility that the identity of a @entity6 intelligence officer might be revealed			1
’ @entity136 , the government ’s communications headquarters , and the police are using a large amount of resources to decrypt and process the material , mr @entity19 said			1
he warned of the urgent need to identify what other material is on the hard drives ‘ to assess the risks to sensitive intelligence sources and methods , and the threat to intelligence agency staff should their identities or details of their operational tradecraft be obtained by hostile actors ’			0
mr @entity19 said the @entity10 ’s publication of details from the documents had already caused ‘ real and serious damage ’ to national security			2
@entity162 , the editor of the @entity10 , branded his claims ‘ unsubstantiated and inaccurate ’			0
he said : ‘ @entity10 took every decision on what to publish very slowly and very carefully and when we met with government officials in july they acknowledged that we had displayed a “ responsible ” attitude			2
‘ the government ’s behaviour does not match their rhetoric in trying to justify and exploit this dismaying blurring of terrorism and journalism			0

@entity26 was *tasered* in the street after police mistook his walking stick for a weapon
mr @entity26 is registered blind after suffering two strokes
