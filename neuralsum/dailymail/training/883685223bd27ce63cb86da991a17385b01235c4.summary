housing staff from @entity7 found the @entity8 roaming around the bottom floor of the property in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , when they went to evict the tenant following complaints from neighbours			1
the carpets were muddied and covered in droppings , and rooms were so full of boxes of junk that officials could not get into them			1
this little piggy stayed at home : this is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty it is thought the pig had been kept at the house for a year			1
officials also found a dog at the property			0
one resident living in the same road said : ' i saw the man with the pig when it was tiny and he just had it in his hands outside the front of his home			1
' i thought it was one of those micro-pigs which would n’t grow			2
' @entity51 think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 some residents reported smelling urine around the property when the weather was warm			1
two @entity63 ponies were known , by the @entity64 , to have previously been kept in the small back garden			1
another resident said : ' he used to chuck stuff outside in the middle of the night and once i saw laminate flooring soaked in poo and urine piled up outside the home			0
' @entity74 , which manages council housing in the city , said the tenant was an ' excessive hoarder ' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all			1

council officials are now trying to trace his whereabouts			2
@entity74 had been trying to get access to the property since september last year when the first complaint was made of a pony being kept in the rear garden and a pig being inside			1
