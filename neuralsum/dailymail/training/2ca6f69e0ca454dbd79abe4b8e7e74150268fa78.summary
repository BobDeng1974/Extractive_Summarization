by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 29 march 2013 a mother - of - two has won almost £ 10,000 in damages from cosmetics firm @entity3 after she was unfairly dismissed after being told ' if you wish to have a family life then this is not the job for you '			1
@entity9 told an employment tribunal she felt pressured into working 60 - hour weeks despite only being contracted for 40 - and said the firm 's ' hypocritical ' treatment of her flew in the face of its slogan : ' @entity3 - the company for women			1
' the tribunal , in @entity18 , found that she was unfairly dismissed from @entity20 and that the firm covered up evidence of ' bullying ' when investigating her grievance			1
she has been awarded almost £ 10,000 in damages			0
tribunal : @entity9 has won almost £ 10,000 in damages from cosmetics giant @entity3 after being unfairly dismissed			1
the tribunal heard her line manager made derogatory comments towards her the 46 - year - old , of @entity31 , @entity18 , had worked at @entity3 for nine years and says that initially she ' absolutely loved ' her job			1
she spent five years working for the company on a freelance basis as a sales representative			2
but in 2008 , mrs @entity9 , who has two boys now aged 18 and 13 , became employed by @entity3 as an area manager on a permanent contract - and that was when the problems began			1
she said : ' i had been number one for sales in my area , i was good at my job			0
i really believed in @entity20 as a company , and i loved the products			0
' i was told that i 'd be working around 40 - hours a week in my new position			1
however , pretty much as soon as i started i was told i needed to work 60 - hour weeks if i wanted to reach my targets			1
' in august 2011 , with the recession in full - swing , she , along with other area managers working for the company , failed to meet some of her targets			1
she was called to what she was told would be an informal ' chat ' at a hotel but was shocked when she turned up and discovered it was in fact a meeting held to discuss her performance			0
mrs @entity9 had assumed the meeting would be held in private , but was distressed when it was conducted in the foyer of a busy hotel in full view of guests			1
the tribunal ruling states : ' the background to the complaint of unfair dismissal was the conduct of ms @entity72 in relation to the complainant			2
' we considered that the former must have known that the discussion on august 2 would amount to a concern meeting			0
colleagues : mrs @entity9 with her former line manager @entity72 ( left )			1
she claims staff made derogatory comments about miss @entity72 and the comments were never revealed to her ' however , her failure to notify the claimant in advance of that fact or to arrange a more private venue than the main reception area of a large hotel accorded with the respondent 's usual practice in these situations			0
' the tribunal accepted the meeting itself did not amount to bullying on that occasion , but mrs @entity9 says it was at this point that she claims she was told that if she wished to have a ' family life ' with her partner and two boys then the job was not for her			1
she said : ' after the meeting i started to feel really ill , i went to see a doctor who told me if carried on working , i was in danger of having a stroke			2
my blood pressure was sky high			0
' i felt i had no choice but to go off sick			2
' she put in a formal grievance about her treatment that same month and colleagues of her line manager @entity72 were asked to give feedback about her ( miss @entity72 's ) performance			2
one member of staff described miss @entity72 as : ' @entity120 , some managers are frightened of her			0
' problems : mrs @entity9 , pictured when she worked for @entity3 , had worked at @entity3 for nine years and says that initially she ' absolutely loved ' her job until she was handed a permanent contract and struggled to meet targets the colleague added : ' she has no respect or consideration for work , life balance			1
she can have an aggressive manner on the phone			0
she tells managers to work nights and weekends			0
' she is unapproachable and untrustworthy and lacks empathy			0
' there were also number of positive comments including one response from a staff member which said : ' allows you to make your own mistakes then supports you afterwards , available at any time ' and added that she is ' no pushover and does n't make things personal '			0
however , the majority of responses were negative			0
despite a number of meetings between @entity20 and mrs @entity9 the nature of some of the feedback about miss @entity152 was never revealed			1
she was repeatedly told there was no evidence of bullying , but only some ' development ' issues			2
in february 2012 mrs @entity9 resigned , as she said she felt she was being misled by @entity3 and had no choice			1
the tribunal panel ruling stated ' the matter , to adopt a cliché , was to be swept under the carpet			2
' the claimant - who , so far as they knew , was not aware of the results of the anonymous questionnaire - was to be told , as before , that there were some ' development ' issues which were being pursued with ms @entity72 but there was no evidence of bullying			1
' that was simply not the case			0
' mrs @entity9 was awarded £ 9,500.88 in compensation after the ruling in january this year , but said that she has been left in debt after being forced to resign from her £ 333 a week job with @entity3			2
she represented herself throughout the hearing and said she was ' terrified ' but happy with the outcome , after which @entity3 's barrister shook her hand			0
after the tribunal , which concluded in january , a spokesperson for @entity3 said : ' as the company for women , @entity3 believes in treating our @entity189 and employees equitably , with fairness and respect			2
' we have a firm commitment to fair play and equal opportunities and as a company our commitment sits at the heart of everything that we do			0
' whilst we can not comment on individual cases , we are naturally very disappointed at the tribunal 's outcome			0
