@entity1 manager @entity0 wants to see sin - bins brought into the @entity3 to help referees avoid sending off players incorrectly			1
the former @entity7 manager called for an improvement to refereeing standards last season and the issue came to a head last weekend when @entity14 boss @entity13 criticised referee @entity15 and @entity0 hit out at @entity16 after @entity1 's draw with @entity18			1
@entity0 sees the introduction of technology as a good thing for the game , and also endorsed the idea of a time - keeper after @entity26 's late equaliser against the @entity1 on sunday â€“ while favouring a plan to trial sin - bins			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 believes the introduction of sin - bins will help out referees @entity14 manager @entity13 ( right ) has frequently queried the standard of refereeing this season ' in terms of sin - bins , i certainly would ( trial them ) , ' @entity0 said			1
' if you ' re talking about a soft yellow and whether or not it should be a sending off i think that 's a sin - bin			2
' there are times when a player does n't really deserve to be sent off			0
with ten minutes in the sin - bin , they come back on and ( while they 're off ) the opposing team has got the chance to take advantage			2
' and @entity0 also felt that the impact of suspensions felt by soft red cards was not always in the benefit of the side facing the red - carded player			2
speaking at a @entity59 event and discussing of using sin - bins , @entity0 said : ' the player does n't get banned , he does n't miss the next game			1
' it might be less of an advantage to that team ( their opponents ) to miss the next game so you do n't really gain any advantage from it			0
' former referees chief @entity68 also confirmed that he had discussed the idea with representatives from the @entity71 about the idea			0
@entity0 also backed the introduction of a timekeeper after @entity26 's equaliser against @entity1 former referees chief @entity76 added his voice to calls that sin - bins should be given a test ' yellow cards are reducing the interaction between players and referees , ' @entity68 said			1
' a referee should be saying ' i want an improvement on your behaviour , will you do that '			0
@entity91 ( @entity71 technical manager ) favours sin - bins			2
whether it 's in the conference or somewhere else , it should be tested			0
' @entity0 also supports the introduction of video replays and proposed the idea of a ' two challenge ' system , similar to the system used in tennis			0
under that ruling , managers would be given two opportunities per game to refer a referee 's decision to a video replay if they disagreed with the original judgement .			0

he believes it will help them stop sending off players incorrectly
