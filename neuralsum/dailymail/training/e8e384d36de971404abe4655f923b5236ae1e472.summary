by @entity0 hundreds of teachers are spending all or part of their time on union work , costing taxpayers £ 15million a year			1
some union representatives are paid teaching salaries of up to £ 70,000 yet many have not taken a class for years , a survey has shown			1
their salaries are paid by local authorities and schools receive no extra money to cover for the union reps – meaning they have less to spend on educating pupils			1
conflict : @entity19 has been at war with teaching unions over pay and pensions under the system , trade union officials can take ‘ reasonable ’ paid time off for union work , known as facilities time , such as representing members in employment disputes			1
but the definition of what is reasonable is wide open to interpretation			0
now the @entity33 is to investigate the issue at a time when education secretary @entity19 is effectively at war with the two biggest teachers ’ unions over pay and conditions			1
the @entity33 said it was taking action due to demands by local authorities and headteachers and insisted the timing was coincidental			2
a source said : ‘ the view is by the end of the year we will be issuing robust advice			0
’ the situation has also created vast differences in the amount of money being diverted to union causes			2
the @entity33 , headed by @entity19 , has said it will issue robust guidance on the issue @entity59 survey of public funding for all unions last year found @entity62 , which has 1.1million residents , spends £ 458,000 for ten full - time equivalent education reps			1
yet @entity65 , with a population of 1.5million , diverts around £ 144,000			0
the study suggested that , overall , at least £ 14.5million is spent on more than 427 full - time equivalent posts each year			0
official figures have never been compiled			0
@entity71 general secretary @entity70 has said that the representative are essential schools minister @entity73 yesterday signalled at least half of union reps ’ time should be spent teaching			1
‘ it is reasonable to expect all trade union representatives in schools to spend the majority of their working hours carrying out school - based jobs			0
‘ they should not be spending all their taxpayer - funded time out of the classroom			2
’ the @entity33 said there were no plans to change the rules but said it was necessary to clarify how they are implemented			2
it added : ‘ a large number of union representatives are paid as teachers but do not spend any of their contracted time teaching			1
‘ this creates additional work for the very many hardworking teachers across the country			2
' some of these local , regional and national union representatives have not taught in a school for many years			0
' this represents a significant cost to the taxpayer of many millions of pounds			0
’ the @entity71 and @entity105 , which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them , have been holding regional strikes over issues including payrise caps , the introduction of performance - related pay and changes to pensions			1
two more are planned next month before a national walk - out nearer the end of this term			0
@entity71 general secretary @entity70 said union reps were essential for maintaining good relationships between employers and employees			1
she added : ‘ we will of course take part in the review to present the excellent case for maintaining facilities time			2
’ @entity128 , of the @entity129 , said : ‘ it is not for the government to specify how unions should organise themselves			0
’ @entity133 of the @entity134 ’ @entity59 said : ‘ the schools budget should be spent on educating our children , not subsidising unions			0

survey shows hundreds of teachers spending time on union work
@entity33 says it will investigate the claims
