she was the daughter of a @entity2 rector but the young @entity3 used to dream of being a soldier , spending her childhood galloping through the countryside while pretending she was fighting in battle			1
twenty years later , when war broke out for real across @entity16 , the adult @entity9 enlisted for the army in @entity11 , one of the allied countries , and in the process , became the only @entity18 woman to see front line action			1
now @entity9 's amazing story is to be told in a @entity22 radio documentary on @entity23 tonight as part of its @entity25 at @entity27			2
a postcard showing sergeant - major @entity3 , the only woman to fight on the frontline in @entity25 she lived an extraordinary life , even by today 's standards ; battling against the odds to achieve her dream of fighting as an equal alongside men			1
and it was n't just the art of ' soldiering on ' in which she saw herself as an equal to her male companions : drinking , smoking , racing cars and shooting - all still very much masculine pursuits were considered fair game to @entity9			1
surprisingly her background would not have suggested such maverick spirit			2
born in 1876 in @entity45 , @entity9 was the youngest of eight children			2
the family , headed by her rector father @entity48 , moved to @entity2 when she was nine years old			1
she had a typically middle - class childhood that included a governess and stint at finishing school , but rather than dreaming of steady life with a husband and children , @entity9 always yearned for adventure			2
according to @entity58 , @entity9 's biographer : ' women in those days were supposed to lead lives of demure respectablity which included tea parties and playing tennis			2
it could be very dull , particularly for someone like @entity9 who was a tomboy			2
' @entity9 loved being in the army , saying ' i never loved anything so much in my entire life			1
' this photograph was taken in @entity70 in 1919 after training as a stenographer in @entity72 , @entity9 used her wages and a legacy from a rich uncle and headed off to explore the world			2
she worked as a secretary in @entity78 , camped in @entity79 in @entity80 and , even , while working her way across @entity82 , shot a man in self - defence			2
@entity9 was 38 years old when @entity18 declared war on @entity86 in 1914 , living in @entity72 with her 15 - year - old nephew @entity87 and her elderly father			2
she signed up to be a volunteer with the ambulance service and within eight days was on her way to @entity11 with the first volunteer unit to leave @entity18			1
at first , she worked with the @entity93 but soon enlisted in the @entity11 army - one of the few in the world to accept women			1
she soon moved up the ranks , becoming corporal and then sergeant - major , and did n't shy away from the action			0
while engaged in hand - to - hand fighting , @entity9 was wounded by a grenade while helping to defend her position			1
she was rescued by a lieutenant in her company who risked his life to crawl out under fire to drag her back to safety			0
one of the guys : sergeant - major @entity3 inspecting her troops for her exceptional bravery under fire , she was awarded a medal and made headlines around the world , but it had come at a price - shrapnel had shredded the flesh of her back and the right side of her body from shoulder to knee			1
her right arm had been broken and badly lacerated			1
once recovered , she rejoined the men in the frontline trenches , fought alongside them as they regained the country they had lost nearly three years before , and survived @entity129 influenza			1
says @entity58 : ' they called her a ' brother ' , as as an honorary man			0
she was a good soldier , starting the war as a private and had made sergeant - major by end of war			0
' she adds : ' @entity11 was the only country that allowed women to do anything they wanted during the war they had more freedom than anywhere else partly because the @entity11 did n't know what to make of these women and their need was so desperate			1
' when the war ended she remained in the army , saying : ' i never loved anything so much in my life			1
' but in 1922 when she was demobilised , @entity9 found it hard to readjust			0
‘ i felt neither fish nor flesh when i came out of the army , ’ she said			1
‘ the first time i put on women ’s clothes , i slunk through the streets			0
’ she drifted between @entity156 and @entity11 for several years but then found love in the shape of @entity159 , a handsome , educated ' @entity160 officer ' , 12 years her junior , who had served as one of her sergeants			1
the @entity11 army was one of the few to accept women and @entity9 felt at home with the other soldiers they married in 1927			1
two years later , they moved to the new kingdom of @entity173 and there they stayed			0
but with tensions once more brewing , neither were to enjoy a peaceful life			0
the @entity178 invaded in april 1941 and four days later , aged 65 , @entity9 pulled on her uniform and marched off to fight			1
within days , though , her old war wound put an end to her plans			0
it took only 11 days for the @entity86 to defeat the @entity173 army and occupy the country			2
@entity9 was imprisioned by the @entity186 - the @entity86 political police - and was freed after a week , but had to report to a @entity186 officer every week			0
sadly her beloved husband died of heart failure in 1941			0
after the war @entity9 was left alone and penniless			0
however undeterred she moved to stay with her nephew first in @entity193 and then @entity194 - now @entity195 - where at the age of 70 she raised local hackles by drinking and smoking with the black peasant population			2
always a maverick : even before @entity9 was raising eyebrows with her unconventional behaviour the young soldier : the 15 - year - old @entity9 looked demure but was a tomboy at heart she finally returned to @entity2 and took to using an electric wheelchair to travel between the local villages			1
she would set off , white hair streaming behind her , as she pushed it to its full speed			0
increasingly nostalgic for the war , she lived for the annual gathering of the @entity213 , for whom she was a heroine			0
after a brief illness , she died at @entity215 and @entity216 on 24 november 1956 of ‘ obstructive jaundice ’ , aged 80			0
she had renewed her passport shortly before she died , still dreaming of places to see and trips to take			0
according to her biographer @entity58 , @entity9 was even more modern than women are today in a sense			0
' she let nothing hold her back			0
she did what she wanted to do and she was proof that women could do whatever they wanted			0
' i think she helped shift the perception of what women could do			0
she really pushed the boundaries			0
' a documentary on @entity3 will be aired on @entity23 today as part of the @entity22 ’s @entity234 series .			1
