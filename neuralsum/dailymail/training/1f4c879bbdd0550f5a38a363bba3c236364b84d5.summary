by @entity0 for @entity1 an internationally - acclaimed medic and his team of workers showed a ' cynical disregard ' for the @entity6 by working just half their contracted hours in a scam which cost taxpayers £ 1.1m			1
the four top health experts , all from @entity11 , were employed by @entity13 hospital in @entity14 on full - time salaries to provide expertise on operating heart and lung machines during operations			1
but the fraudsters billed the hospital for 14,000 hours that they never worked - while ' arrogantly flitting ' across other @entity6 trusts in @entity11 making ' truck loads of cash ' as private contractors			1
their scam became such a cash cow that they secretly referred to the hospital as ' @entity32 ' and set up a ' bonus points ' in which they rewarded themselves for successfully carrying out the con			1
@entity36 , pictured left , and @entity38 , pictured right , were two of the four fraudsters who conned £ 1.1m out of the @entity6 in a ' systematic , well - planned ' scam in which they worked just half their contracted hours ' leader ' @entity38 , 41 , a highly respected perfusionist who is published widely in academic journals , alone billed the @entity6 for more than £ 400,000 of work that was never done			1
all four defendants - all of whom were directors at a private company in @entity11 at the time - have now been jailed for a total of nine years for the ' systematic , well - planned ' scam			1
@entity38 was jailed for three years while his co-defendants - @entity36 , 36 , @entity53 , 51 , @entity54 , 41 - were all handed two - year terms			1
they all worked as perfusionists - blood circulation specialists who operate heart and lung bypass equipment which keep patients alive during heart surgery			2
the shamed medics were convicted by a jury in july this year after a 13 - week trial of one count of conspiracy to defraud the @entity6 between 2007 and 2011			2
judge @entity67 branded @entity38 the ' leader ' of the fraud , saying there was ' no doubt ' his involvement was ' greater than your co-directors '			1
he said : ' this was a systematic , well - planned and organised and executed deception by all of your over a significant period of time - four years , or so , in total			1
' while taking a salary from the @entity6 for a 37 - and - a - half hour week , you worked elsewhere at other hospitals during @entity6 hours			1
you all four gravely abused the trust placed in you			0
' it 's awful to see people of your education , previous good character and achievements convicted of these kinds			0
i feel these offences were motivated purely by greed			0
' the court heard that the four medics - who were directors at @entity95 ( @entity96 ) - were contracted between 2007 and 2011			1
they were employed to provide clinical perfusion services to manage heart and lung machines during cardiac surgery at @entity13			0
but they failed to work their contracted hours , instead opting to make extra money at other hospitals , mainly @entity104			1
the four top health experts , all from @entity11 , were employed by @entity13 hospital in @entity14 , pictured , on full - time salaries but ' arrogantly flitted ' across other @entity6 trusts in @entity11 making ' truck loads of cash ' during the four - year period , the fraudsters were overpaid by about £ 420,000 , the court was told			1
the private work they charged for at other hospitals while they should have been at @entity13 gave them a further £ 700,000			1
@entity118 was told how a series of damning e-mails led to the downfall of the medics			0
the defendants reminded each other in emails about doing ' face shows ' , which meant turning up to work every so often to stop staff becoming suspicious about their whereabouts opening the case earlier this year , prosecutor @entity130 told jurors : ' this is in many respects a sad case			2
it involves one of the perfusion medical teams at @entity138 engaging in a fraud			2
' they provided significant services to the public and were rewarded by a salary but it was not enough			0
' they started to earn more by doing less and engaging in activities which stole from their employer , the public purse and from you			0
' in one of the crucial e-mails , @entity38 warned that care needed to be taken with the amount they were billing the @entity6 ' so as not to draw attention to the number of people we have doing nothing '			2
in may 2010 , he also referred in an e-mail to how one of his team would ' continue to make us truck loads of cash paid for by @entity32 '			1
one , sent by @entity38 to other defendants , revealed he tried to avoid @entity6 work ' unless it 's going to make cash / make our lives easier '			1
and in another damning e-mail clements sent to @entity172 , she said : ' look at ' @entity173 ' and the manipulation that we go through there to make it run without highlighting people are missing			0
' that 's why when you are there you make sure you talk to everybody you are high profile so you are noticed ! ' @entity184 was arrested by detectives as he arrived to attend a meeting at @entity138			2
mr @entity187 , mitigating for @entity38 , said he had a seriously ill young daughter who requires round the clock care for a chronic lung condition			2
@entity38 has also had to resign for a variety of highly respected roles within the industry and is highly likely to struggle to find work within the ' small community ' when he leaves prison			1
he said : ' his career as a perfusionist is over - the destruction of that career in my respectful submission is utter and complete			2
' @entity204 , @entity205 , on behalf of @entity53 , told the court : ' she was a high - class perfusionist , whatever the circumstances , she is a loss to the profession			0
' she is a loss to the general public who will no longer be treated by her			0
she has lost her reputation - she has lost her good character			0
' @entity215 , for @entity36 , from @entity11 , said it was a ' most unusual fraud case ' in that the defendants had not achieved an easy life and were ' still working all the hours that @entity219 sends '			0
@entity220 , for @entity221 , from @entity222 , said his client did not play a leading role in the scame			0
he now lives ' quietly ' with his elderly mother in @entity227 and will never work within the industry again			0
all the defendants were banned from holding directorships of companies for four years			0
two other junior colleagues from @entity96 charged with the same count were acquitted at the trial			0
after the hearing @entity235 , head of the @entity236 at @entity237 , said : ' from day one , @entity38 and his associates set out to defraud the @entity6 of hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
' the time , effort and planning that they were willing to put in to their criminal activities reaped them considerable rewards - until @entity237 caught up with them			2
' ' these custodial sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and will act as a powerful deterrent to others			0
' there will be a proceeds of crime hearing at a later date .			0

experts were paid full - time salaries for 4 years at @entity138 , @entity14
they did *n't* work 14,000 of the contracted hours for which they were paid
instead , they raked in private fees by ' arrogantly flitting ' across other trusts
even set up ' points ' scheme to reward themselves for carrying out scam well
plot orchestrated by @entity38 , who *boasted* of ' truck loads of cash '
@entity277 said it was a ' systematic , well - planned and executed deception '
