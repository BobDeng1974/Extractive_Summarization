many managers will get six - figure payoffs when they are made redundant by @entity2 published : 19:39 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 20 march 2013 @entity5 executives facing the axe are in line for bumper redundancy payoffs – and could walk back into @entity10 jobs within a month , it has emerged			1
sir @entity11 wrote to staff whose posts will go as part of the health reforms explaining that they can be rehired by the @entity5 after four weeks			1
many managers are set for six - figure payoffs when they are made redundant next month			1
some are expected to receive more than £ 450,000			0
sir @entity11 wrote to staff whose posts will go as part of the health reforms explaining that they can be rehired by the @entity5 after four weeks however , sir @entity11 has urged them to wait at least six months before returning to work to avoid ‘ reputational damage ’ to the @entity5			1
yesterday it also emerged that 400 managers currently employed by the @entity5 earn more than the prime minister , who is on £ 142,500			2
@entity28 mp @entity27 , who obtained the figures , said : ‘ i accept that a person in a position of responsibility will need to be properly remunerated			0
‘ but for 400 managers to be paid more than the prime minister who has responsibility for running the country is ludicrous			0
’ but the revelation that those being made redundant could walk straight into new jobs – at a time when the @entity5 is under unprecedented financial pressure – is sure to fuel anger among patients			1
the letter is also further evidence that sir @entity11 is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the @entity5			1
it states : ‘ i would ask these individuals to be mindful of this and of the possible reputational damage to themselves and to the @entity5 should they seek to gain paid employment or consultancy work in the @entity5 soon after they receive their redundancy payments			2
’ already sir @entity11 is suspected of presiding over a regime whereby hospitals routinely fiddle their figures and whistleblowers – such as @entity59 , who said he was sacked as chief executive of @entity61 because of a row over an 18 - week non-emergency waiting list target – are discouraged from speaking out			1
last night @entity28 mp @entity65 said : ‘ the tone of this letter does very little to persuade anyone who has concerns that sir @entity11 is encouraging a culture of cover - ups			2
‘ it confirms exactly what has been behind all the problems we have seen with the @entity77 scandal			0
the reaction is always to try and bury bad news			0
’ @entity59 , former chief executive of the @entity56			0
he claims he was sacked because of a row over an 18 - week non-emergency waiting list target on april 1 , thousands of managers and staff employed at @entity84 will be made redundant when these bodies are axed as part of the @entity5 reforms			1
yet many will be re-employed by new , gp - led groups or recently - formed organisations such as the @entity92 or @entity93			0
even so , the @entity5 is expected to spend more than a £ 1billion on their redundancy packages , with thousands of staff in line for six - figure sums			1
this is despite the fact the @entity10 is trying to save money , with hospitals rationing non-urgent treatments and slashing nursing posts			0
@entity105 , of the @entity106 ’ @entity104 said : ‘ it speaks volumes of the culture embodied by sir @entity11 that senior staff at the @entity5 are handed such huge pay - offs even if they may return only months later			1
‘ the @entity5 is overly bureaucratic with too many pen - pushers handed jobs for life			2
cutting this bloated bureaucracy is vital but unnecessarily generous pay - offs will undermine efforts to trim the fat			0
‘ ministers have forced the @entity5 to spend millions on managers ’ pay - offs at the same time as thousands of nursing jobs are being axed			2
it ’s a shameful waste of resources			0
’ under @entity5 rules , managers will be given one month ’s redundancy pay for every year they have worked			2
one , sir @entity127 , the chief executive of @entity128 and @entity129 , is reportedly set for a package worth £ 465,000 .			0
