the @entity76 slid 10 points , or 0.6 percent , to 1,681.55 and the @entity79 composite dropped 10 points , or 0.3 percent , to 3,771.48 there is a simple reason why the budget battle — and , more importantly , an upcoming fight over the debt ceiling — are so crucial : the credit of the @entity3 is the bedrock that nearly every other investment is built upon , largely due to the assumption that the nation will always pay its debts			1
' the concern is government has become so polarized that if it can not pass ( a budget ) , there 's a greater chance that the debt ceiling battle will go to the brink or possibly lead to a default , ' said @entity110 , global equity strategist with @entity112			2
monday 's decline adds to what has been eventful september for investors			2

' it slows down activity on companies that depend on federal contracts			0
' some investors think a shutdown may be a positive event in the long - term			0
the political pressure from a shutdown could force politicians to get down to business and negotiate — particularly on the issue of the debt ceiling			0
' this may be good thing in the long run because it may lead to compromise , ' said @entity178 , chief strategist at @entity179			0
treasury secretary @entity180 said last week that the government would run out of borrowing authority by roughly oct. 17			0
the last time the debt ceiling issue came up in august 2011 , it led to @entity76 's downgrading the @entity3 ' credit rating and the @entity74 went through nearly three weeks of nauseating triple - digits moves almost daily			1

essentially all market sectors could see a reaction to a shutdown , with industries tied to the pace of economic growth - like energy and financials - seeing outsized impacts			0
the defensive sector ' will feel an immediate impact since its biggest customer is the @entity3 government , ' said @entity240			1
