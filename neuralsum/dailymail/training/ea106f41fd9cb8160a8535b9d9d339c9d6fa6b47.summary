a group of soldiers who served with sgt @entity2 all agreed that he was a deserter , before angrily spelling out how they would have ' died for someone who then simply left '			1
sgt @entity2 was captured by the @entity7 in @entity8 in june 2009			1
he was freed in exchange for five @entity7 mujahideen being held in @entity11			1
one , @entity27 , said : ‘ [ @entity2 ] did not serve with distinction			1
that ’s a spit in the face to everyone who joined the @entity32 and anyone who died looking for him			2
’ he added : ‘ here is the thing			0
when you ’re in combat does n’t matter , left , right , @entity40 , @entity41 , whatever you want to be			0
he ’s my brother , he ’s my brother , he ’s my brother			0
we ’ll all ride together , we ’ll all die together			0
i do n’t know how he felt about us but we would all die for him and he left			0
’ the soldiers are demanding that @entity2 tells his side of the story , saying that he owes it to them and the @entity47 people			1
six of sgt. @entity2 's former platoon mates are shopping proposals for a book and movie manuscript that are fiercely critical of the former prisoner of war team leader @entity54 said @entity2 had asked him a number of questions a short time before his disappearance that , in retrospect , make it apparent that @entity2 had been planning to leave			1
@entity2 asked him , for example , how much of a cash advance he could get and how to go about mailing home his personal computer and other belongings			1
he also asked what would happen if his weapon and other sensitive items such as night vision goggles went missing			0
he said he told @entity68 that , as any soldier would know , that would be ' a big deal '			0
' at the time ... it was n't really alarming ' to hear @entity2 ask about those things , @entity54 said			2
' yes , it was a kind of off - the - wall question , ' but the notion of a fellow soldier running off during the night seemed so far - fetched as to not be possible , he said			0
@entity54 said that crucial missions were cancelled while the platoon searched for him			0
demanding answers : @entity2 's team leader @entity54 said the @entity47 people are owed an explanation about the exchange in this image taken from video obtained from @entity86 , which has been authenticated based on its contents and other @entity91 reporting , sgt. @entity2 , right , stands with a @entity7 fighter in eastern @entity8 in enemy territory : a @entity7 fighter speaks to sgt. @entity2 in eastern @entity8 he said he feels strongly that @entity2 should face trial for desertion , but he said it is less clear that he should be blamed for the deaths of all soldiers killed during months of trying to find him			1
he said he knows of at least one death on an intelligence - directed infantry patrol to a village in search of @entity2			2
more broadly , the mission of his entire unit changed after @entity2 's disappearance because it began to incorporate efforts to pursue clues to his whereabouts			2
' those soldiers who died on those missions , they would not have been where they were ... if @entity2 had never walked away , ' he said			1
' at the same time i do believe it is somewhat unfair for people to say , " it is @entity2 's fault that these people are dead			1
" i think that 's a little harsh			0
' the exchange has become a toxic issue for president @entity23 with republicans saying the swap is ' putting a price ' on @entity47 soldiers and will lead to more kidnappings			1
@entity68 , who is now aged 28 , is being treated at a @entity47 military hospital in @entity129 before he flies back home to a growing row and many unanswered questions about what actually happened to him			2
on monday , @entity136 chairman @entity135 said that he planned to hold hearings on the matter and get to the bottom of what happened			0
he added that he felt the president ‘ broke the law ’ because he did not consult @entity143 about the release of inmates of @entity11 , as he is obliged to do so under the 2014 @entity146			2
@entity148 senator @entity147 , @entity149 , also said : ‘ now we make deals with terrorists			0
and the question going forward is , have we just put a price on other @entity47 soldiers ? ‘ what does this tell terrorists , that if you capture a @entity47 soldier , you can trade that soldier for five terrorists we ’ve gone after ? ’			1
