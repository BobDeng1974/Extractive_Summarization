‘ it was difficult in the first half , ’ said @entity49			0
‘ it was wet and we were playing into a fairly strong wind and i thought we did a pretty good job in the first half			2
with 20 minutes to go , we got ourselves into a pretty strong position where we should try to kick on and probably get a few more tries but we did n’t manage that			0
‘ we lacked a bit of composure in their 22			0
we were down there often enough but we were n’t good enough to get another few tries			2
that has been an issue for us			0
