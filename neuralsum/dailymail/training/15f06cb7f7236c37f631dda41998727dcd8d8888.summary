@entity0 could move a step closer to landing the permanent @entity4 manager 's job with victory over @entity6 on friday			1
@entity7 has guided the @entity8 to four wins from seven matches since taking over on a caretaker basis from the sacked @entity12 last month			1
chairman @entity13 has a five - man committee to advise him over the club 's next managerial appointment , with names such as @entity18 and @entity19 thought to be on the shortlist along with @entity7			2
@entity0 ( above ) has four wins from seven games since becoming caretaker manager at @entity4 former @entity24 manager @entity18 ( above ) has also been linked with the vacancy at the @entity27 club but while @entity28 , @entity29 mull over the options , @entity7 has quietly gone about transforming a side who had collected just one point from their previous seven @entity35 games under @entity12			1
one player benefiting from the former @entity4 defender 's spell in charge is @entity40 , whose late equaliser secured a dramatic 3 - 3 draw at @entity43 on tuesday			2
the 22 - year - old told the club website : " we just had the desire to at least come away with something			0
we took a point - yes , we wanted it to be three , but it was n't a defeat so it means we can build on that going into the @entity6 game on friday			0
" you ca n't keep getting a win , a defeat , a win , a defeat - you 've got to keep the momentum going so it 's really important we did n't get a defeat on tuesday			0
we 've got a lot of games coming up , so hopefully we can carry on			0
" @entity40 ( right ) is desperate for @entity4 to continue their improvement against @entity6 @entity7 will hand a late fitness check to defender @entity68 , who missed out in midweek through illness , while captain @entity70 will return to the starting line - up to face his old club			1
a point would lift @entity4 out of the relegation zone for the first time this season , while @entity6 are looking for a win which would move them to within a point of leaders @entity81			1
but @entity83 boss @entity82 is well aware of the stark contrast between @entity12 's confidence - drained team and the in - form side he will face at @entity87			2
@entity70 ( right ) is set to return to @entity4 's starting line - up at home to @entity6 on friday " i saw them in one of the last games under @entity12 , ( a 1 - 0 defeat ) at home to @entity95 , and at that time they were struggling , there was no mentality , nothing in the team , " he said			1
" then i saw them against @entity102 at home and it was another team completely - they won 4 - 0			0
so it 's going to be a very tough night for us , especially because it 's a proper derby			0
" the visitors will be without suspended midfielder @entity109 , while winger @entity110 and six - goal top scorer @entity111 are injury doubts .			0

@entity7 has improved @entity4 's results since taking over in *temporary* role
he has four wins from seven since stepping in after @entity12 sacking
a draw against @entity6 would lift them out of the relegation zone
