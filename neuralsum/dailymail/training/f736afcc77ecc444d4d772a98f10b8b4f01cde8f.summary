by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 17:31 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:32 est , 18 december 2013 house majority leader @entity4 has rented his @entity6 apartment from a tanning bed lobbyist			1
the perpetually - tan @entity8 from @entity9 has repeatedly denied that he has ever gone to a tanning salon			1
it has long been known for years that @entity4 has rented his two bedroom basement apartment in @entity6 from @entity13 , a lobbyist			2
hot property : @entity4 pays $ 1,600 in rent for a 2 - bedroom basement apartment in @entity6 that is owned by a lobbyist now it has been revealed that one of the groups that @entity13 represents is the @entity21			1
the @entity22 reported the connection between @entity13 and the tanning booth group but @entity4 's ties to @entity13 were originally reported by the @entity26 in 2006 when he was the @entity4 and president @entity27 was in office			2
connections : @entity4 has known lobbyist @entity13 ( pictured ) for years ever since the @entity9 @entity8 met @entity13 's wife @entity30 in the 1990s at the time , @entity4 's spokesman stressed that though @entity4 had known @entity13 's wife , @entity30 , since the 1990s , their friendship had never been used to enhance his lobbying interests			2
' @entity13 does not lobby @entity4 on any issue and has not lobbied him on any issue during the time period in which @entity4 has been renting the property , ' @entity4 's then - spokesman @entity35 told @entity40 in 2006			0
one of the new high - profile clients that @entity13 has taken on since then was the @entity21 , and they hired @entity13 ’s company , @entity42 , to represent them for $ 90,000 earlier this year			0
they undoubtedly wanted the company to fight for their interests when it was revealed that the @entity47 includes a proposed 10 per cent sales tax against tanning beds			1
in reference to the newfound , @entity13 told @entity22 that there has never been any salon - style bed in the house where @entity4 rents			0
' there is not nor has there ever been a tanning bed in the residence ! ' @entity13 wrote in an email			0
in spite of @entity4 's unseasonable complexion - and this new connection to tanning enthusiasts - he has repeatedly denied ever using such a contraption to get his unusual glow			1
the perpetually - tan @entity8 from @entity9 has repeatedly denied that he has ever gone to a tanning salon this is not the first time that @entity13 and @entity4 have had overlapping interests as @entity42 has represented a number of clients in the restaurant industry			1
they would have been especially interested in the @entity74 - of which @entity4 was one of the co-sponsors			0
though @entity4 ’s spokesman may deny the role their personal relationship has influenced whatever work they have done together , those connections are a major selling point for the company itself			0
‘ at @entity85 , we specialize in forging business and government relationships for our clients , ’ the company ’s website states .			0

@entity4 has repeatedly denied using tanning beds
now it is clear he does have a connection to the industry , however , as it has been revealed that his *landlord* represents their interests
