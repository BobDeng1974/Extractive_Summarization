@entity0 's are at war with a group of elderly patrons who spend sunrise to sunset hogging booths at one @entity7 restaurant , often sharing little more than a small bag of fries between them			1
staff at the branch in @entity14 , @entity11 are becoming increasingly frustrated with the @entity16 pensioners who pass hours gossiping at the window - seat tables amid piles of newspapers but buying very little - with a few admitting they do n't even like the food			1
management have been forced to call police to move on the ever - evolving group as they are driving away business			1
some customers have asked for refunds because there is nowhere to sit			0
a @entity0 's branch in @entity14 , @entity11 was at odds with group of elderly @entity31 in january whom they said hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little the @entity36 in @entity14 where the elderly patrons have frustrated the restaurant chain by taking up all the seats , often for hours at a time @entity39 , 64 , who was enjoying a coffee , fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in @entity0 's , told @entity45 that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go			1
she said : ' it is open so early and stays open until after dark when it 's late			0
it 's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together			0
' the battle between the pensioners and @entity36 has escalated over the past few months with the police receiving four 911 calls since november about the group			2
a police source told @entity45 that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems			0
however the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again			2
police could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and the restaurant requested , but hope the matter could be worked out before that stage			2
the @entity36 's in @entity14 is the popular hang - out spot for some of the elderly @entity16 community in the area it appears that the group of men , and some women , are drawn to the @entity36 on the corner of @entity81 and @entity82 , because it offers a convenient meeting spot from their homes			2
however beyond these reasons , many can not explain why they love to meet at @entity36 so much			0
the elderly @entity31 ' allegiance to the neon - lit branch is especially peculiar as there are other options available to the chatty seniors			0
the @entity92 in @entity14 offers breakfast and lunch for the elderly every day			0
many eat meals at the center - then head for @entity0 's			1
president of the center @entity101 told @entity45 that he provides coffee and snacks for the senior citizens from 8.30am to 5pm every day but ' they do n't come '			2
however @entity39 told @entity45 that the senior center was not open for long enough to suit her and her friends ' needs			1
@entity109 offers the @entity16 community breakfast and lunch daily			0
they have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the @entity36 's battle the elderly people sometimes alternate with a @entity116 nearby on @entity117 which has more space and community boards inside for customers in @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity16			1
@entity123 , who owns the @entity0 's franchise , said in a statement : ' i 'm sure you can imagine any business would find this situation to be difficult when customers prevent other customers from enjoying the restaurant			1
' we continue to work to resolve this situation and create an environment so customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so			0

staff at the branch in @entity14 , @entity11 are becoming increasingly frustrated with the pensioners who are driving away business
it is *unclear* why the seniors love @entity0 's so much when they have a senior center nearby with 25c coffee
police have moved patrons on *...* who walk around the block and return to the same seats
