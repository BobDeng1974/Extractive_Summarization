by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:32 am on 15th july 2011 an obsessed tv producer who hounded a former classmate for eight years was branded ' the stalker who would n't stop stalking '			2
@entity7 , a freelance producer for @entity8 , has been convicted of breaching a restraining order for the third time			1
he was jailed for four months last year for a previous breach			2
he googled therapist @entity12 more than 40,000 times in one year , broke into his victim 's car and made hundreds of late - night phone calls to her home			2
@entity7 and @entity12 leaving @entity18			1
he was jailed last year for stalking her @entity7 , 36 , of @entity21 , north - west @entity20 , first developed an unhealthy obsession with mrs @entity12 while they were students at a college in @entity25 , @entity26			1
after repeatedly telling him to leave her alone , she heard nothing more until she received a dinner invitation from him ten years later - which she declined			2
a few months later , in december 2003 , @entity7 was spotted jogging on the spot outside mrs @entity12 's home and began spending more and more time around her workplace			1
after his arrest , a police search of his computer revealed he had mrs @entity12 's wedding photographs and a @entity40 aerial map of her home			2
he had also paid for background searches to be carried out on both her husband , @entity44 , and her father , and had posed as a prospective parent at the nursery her daughter attended			2
@entity12 was stalked for 8 years by @entity7 a restraining order was put on him in 2006 , which he breached the following year			1
he was jailed for sixteen weeks in january last year for a further breach , but he went on to breach it again and has now appeared before a court for the fourth time			1
the original order banned him from going to her home address , her parents ' address or within a mile of her work after she told the court she felt like a ' sitting duck '			1
she said she suffered a miscarriage , developed an eating disorder and had to move home five times as a result of her ordeal			2
on february 1 this year @entity7 entered the exclusion zone again on the same day a court dismissed a civil case brought by the stalker against his victim , who he claimed had waged a @entity76 ' hate campaign ' against him			1
@entity12 lives in @entity77 , north @entity20 , with her husband and daughter giving evidence from behind a screen at @entity18 , mrs @entity12 said she left her office on @entity83 , @entity84 , and walked to her car parked in @entity86 nearby on her way to pick up her son from nursery - a routine she followed the same time most days			1
the 36 - year old said : ' halfway down i felt a car slowly driving next to me			2
i was on the phone to my husband to tell him about the results of the case and felt the car next to me			0
' i walked over and was shocked			0
i could see mr @entity7 looking at me			1
i recognised his car and i recognised him			0
he was right by the kerb and i was on the pavement right next to him			0
' i shouted to my husband , " i have to go " , because i wanted to take a picture of him on my phone			0
but he saw me and drove off			0
i rang staff at my work because i was shaking			0
' it was slow enough for him to stop and look at me			0
he gave me a very strange smirk			0
' @entity7 claimed that while he was aware he was going through the exclusion zone , it was the easiest route for him to reach @entity110 , where the legal proceedings were taking place , and it was a chance encounter			1
nevertheless , @entity114 , prosecuting , said it was simply an attempt to force mrs @entity12 to court so he could see her			0
speaking when @entity7 was originally jailed for the breach she said : ' this is a case of the stalker who will not stop stalking			1
this is a man who has a history of harassing @entity12			0
he is an intelligent young man who knows what he is up to			0
' if you have an obsession with someone , bringing them to court is one way of seeing them , of coming into contact with them			0
' it is another form of stalking			0
make sure she is there and have contact with her			0
she thought there was a restraining order in place to protect her			1
' we have a young man who is without regard for the order and with every intention of keeping up his campaign of harassment against @entity12			1
it is a case of " chip , chip chip "			0
' @entity7 is to be sentenced next month .			1
