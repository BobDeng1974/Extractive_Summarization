' @entity18 enjoyed a fairytale finish to his one - day career , hitting a team - high score of 74 in front of a record crowd of over 93,000 and making bowling changes that led to immediate wickets			1

he 's been an aggressive captain on the field , sets aggressive fields			0
he 's got to be somebody that we 'll definitely miss , ' @entity3 paceman @entity71 told reporters			2
