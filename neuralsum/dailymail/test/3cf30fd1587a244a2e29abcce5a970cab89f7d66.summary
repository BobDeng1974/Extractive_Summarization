@entity0 was devastated when his sister , @entity1 , died in a car crash when she was just 32			1
only a year before , he had walked her down the aisle to give her away to her husband , @entity4 , from @entity5 , then aged 33 , who seemed equally bereft at the loss of his wife			1
@entity0 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , believed @entity1 had died in a tragic accident that happened in @entity13 , @entity14 , in 1994			1
@entity4 had drugged his wife at their home in the @entity14 village of @entity25 , where they had settled after their wedding , before taking her for a drive			1
he then deliberately crashed their car and , after making his own escape , set it on fire so @entity1 had no hope of survival			1
last year @entity1 's story was turned into an @entity37 drama starring @entity38			1
and now @entity0 has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister 's death , which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later			1
' the fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away , the flames were leaping 20 , 30 feet , it was just ridiculous , ' @entity0 reveals on the latest episode of @entity53 's @entity52			2
' a very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of @entity1			2
there was n't much left of her , poor love			0
' @entity0 said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister , a qualified nurse , had lost her life in just terrible circumstances			1
@entity1 and @entity4 pictured on their wedding day in 1993 , the following year he murdered her he had no reason to suspect @entity4 , who @entity1 had met at a party , had drugged and then burned her alive			1
@entity1 had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993			2
@entity0 recalls : ' he seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted			2
he was a sort of @entity73 type character			0
' he said he and @entity4 consoled one another at the funeral and @entity0 believed he was suffering just as much as he was			1
' he did n't say a lot at the funeral , he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well , ' he said			0
' we were all standing round the graveside , in my right hand i was holding on to @entity4 's left hand			2
' i was in floods of tears , and i looked at @entity4 , and he , he was also in floods of tears			2
and that more than anything else convinced me that it had been a genuine accident			0
' for years @entity0 continued to believe the car crash had been accidental , and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings , they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different			1
@entity97 , pictured on @entity53 's @entity52 , was @entity4 's second wife			2
he attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to @entity1 's death @entity0 lost touch with his brother - in - law when @entity4 moved to @entity102 - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again			1
he married @entity97 and they had son together			0
unbeknownst to @entity108 , he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to @entity1			1
@entity108 also appears on @entity53 's @entity52 and reveals how it felt to be drugged			0
she said : ' these episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet , my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred , i would stagger around as if i was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep			0
' she could n't believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming			0
' these events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me , they were always at the weekends , never inconveniently when i had to be able to go to work , ' she said			0
then in circumstances similar to @entity1 's death , in 1999 she was driven by @entity4 to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy			1
it seems @entity4 could have been about to commit murder again - until he was interrupted by a phone call from @entity108 's concerned parents			2
@entity108 recalls how @entity4 was angry that the call had woken her up and urged her to ignore it but she persuaded him to drive her home so she could see her father			2
@entity4 then fled while @entity108 learned some shocking truths from her parents			2
@entity4 pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder ' we discovered that he 'd opened up a private mail box , he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced , ' she said			1
' there were enquiries to real estate agents back in the @entity160 and @entity161 area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the @entity53 with his infant son			0
at the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies , which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death , and they had my signature forged on them			1
' chillingly , they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and @entity108 is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day			0
@entity4 went on the run back to the @entity53 while @entity108 reported him to the @entity102 police			0
after investigating , they urged @entity14 police to reopen the case into @entity1 's death			0
the lead officer in the case was @entity187			0
he said : ' the original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in @entity102			0
at that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with			0
' @entity108 pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against @entity4 during the trial in which he was dubbed ' the black widower ' however , it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove @entity1 's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge @entity4			1
by then , he was back living in @entity14 and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history			0
in may 2011 , after a long running trial during which he was dubbed ' the @entity210 ' , @entity4 was found guilty of murdering @entity1 , attempting to murder @entity108 and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate			1
now aged 55 , he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years			0
' i think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes , and the fact that he feels no remorse , that it was all premeditated and , given the opportunity he was about to do it again , ' said @entity108 , who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial			0
@entity0 , who had to wait 21 years to get justice for @entity1 , said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again			1
@entity0 says @entity1 's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives he said : ' if anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them , because we could all be living next door to the next @entity4			1
' it was an experience that did nearly destroy me and it nearly destroyed my family but thank @entity247 it did n't and thank @entity247 over a period of time we 've managed to put the pieces back together and move on			0
' @entity53 's @entity52 continues with @entity252 murdered my sister on sunday 12 april at 9pm , only on @entity254			0
