by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 25 april 2013 @entity1 looks set to become the new @entity3 prime minister after being asked to form a government by president @entity5			1
the 46 - year - old nephew of former prime minister @entity7 's long - time chief of staff @entity8 , would be the youngest @entity3 prime minister in 25 years			1
the formation of a government would bring an end to two months of political impasse in @entity3 after an inconclusive election back in february			2
the new government , which could take office in a matter of days , would be backed primarily by the rival centre - left and centre - right groupings , which had refused to cut a deal in the wake of the election			2
leader in waiting : @entity5 , left , has called on @entity1 , right , to form a government in @entity3 @entity25 , deputy leader of the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , is considered a moderate and is close to former party leader @entity27 , who resigned at the weekend after rebels sabotaged him in the voting for a new president , which ended with @entity5 being re-elected			1
@entity25 said yesterday that his party would back any government committed to tackling the ' social - economic emergency ' and enacting serious political reform , including changes to a dysfunctional electoral law considered largely responsible for the two - month long political stalemate			0
in february 's general election , the centre - left narrowly won a majority in the lower house but failed to win control of the @entity44 and was not able to form a government			2
hopes that the deadlock would soon be over have given a further boost to financial markets , with the yield on 10 - year @entity3 government bonds dropping below four percent and the spread , or risk premium , over @entity55 bonds narrowing			2
breakthrough : @entity1 talks to the press after meeting with president @entity5 where he was asked to form a government and end the country 's political deadlock @entity3 's economy has been the most sluggish in @entity64 for more than a decade and mired in a deep recession since the middle of 2011 , with no recovery in sight			1
former prime minister @entity7 's @entity69 ( @entity69 ) party , @entity25 's @entity26 and the centrist @entity73 movement of outgoing premier @entity74 have all said they will cooperate with whomever @entity5 chooses			1
outgoing : former prime minister @entity74 has said that he would co-operate with whoever the president picked as his replacement mr @entity7 said after meeting @entity5 : ' given the crisis the country finds itself in , the country needs a strong , a durable government that can make important decisions			1
' @entity5 hit out at @entity3 's political parties on monday when he was inaugurated for an unprecedented second term , berating them for their ' irresponsibility ' in prolonging the political stalemate for nearly two months			1
he threatened to resign unless the parties agreed to cooperate and find some middle ground on reforms			0
@entity25 's party has been most hurt by the political impasse and the stability of the next government could be threatened given the hostility among many in the party to any deal with @entity7 , their enemy for almost two decades			0
deep internal divisions worsened when former @entity26 leader mr @entity27 was unable to make a government deal with either @entity7 's centre - right or the shock new third political force , @entity107 's @entity106			1
and mr @entity7 has capitalised on the centre - left 's woes			0
one poll gave the centre - right a clear lead of around eight points			0
the anti-establishment @entity106 , which won a quarter of the vote and speaks for millions of @entity3 disillusioned with an entire political class , told mr @entity5 it would sit in opposition and may support specific reforms			0
the @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , a partner of the @entity26 in the february election , and @entity7 's allies in the @entity123 also said they would not join a coalition led by mr @entity125			0
all smiles : @entity7 has capitalised on the damage the political impasses has caused to the centre - left with one opinion poll showing the centre right eight points ahead			0

@entity26 deputy leader @entity1 asked to form government
he will be @entity3 's youngest prime minister in a quarter of a century
