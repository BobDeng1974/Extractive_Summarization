forget your rivalries between @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 on the pitch			2
off it , the battle to be broadcast between those in the @entity9 remains as cut - throat as ever			0
@entity11 and @entity13 's announcement of 25 live fixtures between december 2 and @entity15 means we have our diaries at the ready , but which matches are worthy of being pencilled in ? @entity19 promises to be far from dull for @entity20 , @entity3 and @entity22 fans , but those at @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 may feel aggrieved to find themselves losing out			1
fixtures scroll down for every game 's date and time between december 2 and january 1 @entity11 will show 16 live games over the festive period , including the @entity33 on december 21 @entity13 will show nine live matches over the festive period , including @entity3 vs @entity35 @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity38 will lead @entity11 ' coverage during the @entity41 period 5 - @entity3 5 - @entity20 5 - @entity22 4 - @entity42 4 - @entity4 3 - @entity43 3 - @entity2 3 - @entity44 3 - @entity45 3 - @entity35 2 - @entity46 2 - @entity47 2 - @entity48 2 - @entity49 2 - @entity50 1 - @entity51 1 - @entity52 0 - @entity24 0 - @entity25 0 - @entity26 as the @entity9 elite soak up the viewing figures , fans of @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 have been dealt a particularly bad hand			1
they are the only clubs to be snubbed by @entity13 and @entity11 , closely followed by @entity51 and @entity52 with one game apiece			0
@entity3 , current favourites to win the @entity9 ahead of reigning champions @entity2 , find themselves joint top with @entity20 and , slightly surprisingly , @entity22			1
@entity61 - never one to shy away from the spotlight - appears to have gotten the better of rival manager @entity63			0
the ' @entity64 ' and his side verse @entity22 , @entity48 , @entity50 , @entity44 and @entity35 in their five tv fixtures			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , find themselves on the box just three times when they face @entity43 , @entity52 and @entity49			2
that wo n't help season ticket holders , however , given all those matches are at the @entity73			0
@entity74 and @entity75 have fared better than @entity63 , too			0
the managers of @entity42 and @entity4 have four live matches apiece , including against each other at @entity79 on @entity11 on december 21			2
in the red half of @entity82 , though , manager @entity80 best get used to @entity11 and @entity13 cameras being present to capture - and scrutinise - his every move			0
@entity22 have a hectic @entity41 period on the box , taking on @entity44 , @entity22 , @entity35 , @entity48 and , surely the pick of the lot , @entity4 at @entity89 on december 14 , won by @entity11			1
it seems the most undesirable fixtures fall on a monday , though , with @entity91 among the victims			0
@entity80 's @entity20 find themselves on tv five times during the @entity41 period @entity3 manager @entity61 ( right ) is on tv once more than @entity42 boss @entity74 ( left ) @entity20 vs @entity4 ( sunday , december 14 , @entity11 , 1.30pm ) @entity22 vs @entity49 ( sunday , december 21 , @entity11 , 1.30pm ) @entity35 vs @entity3 ( thursday , january 1 , @entity13 , 5.30pm ) he and his team travel to @entity44 , @entity47 go to @entity43 , @entity3 make their way to @entity48 and @entity45 have @entity4 all on monday nights , making it difficult for away fans with long journeys home afterwards			1
as for @entity22 , under - fire manager @entity104 may not welcome the additional pressure , particularly in games against @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity20 and an @entity43 side looking to recapture their @entity109 - chasing form of last season			1
schadenfreude ? perhaps , but the @entity33 against @entity49 on a dominant day for @entity11 on december 21 means late @entity41 shopping should be avoided			2
@entity13 look to have won the bragging rights for @entity114 and @entity15 , however			0
they snag the majority of games on both prime days , including a tasty @entity20 vs @entity22 clash and a @entity119 derby between @entity35 and @entity3			1
