' addiction is n't any ordinary monster , ' @entity16 wrote in journal entries shared with the @entity74			2
' it 's like a giant octopus weaving its tentacles not just around you but through you , squeezing not hard enough to kill you , but enough to keep you from feeling until you try to get away			0

' pills were the new best friend , ' @entity16 said			2
' @entity125 is the enemy now			0
' @entity16 's mother says she thought the change in behavior was due to a divorce she 'd been going through with @entity16 's father - she did n't suspect drugs			1

' teens have this idea that prescription drugs are safer because you do n't think your parents or the police can tell , but the danger is that these drugs can kill you on your first try			1
there 's no recreational oxy user			0
' @entity103 has used the tragedy of losing her daughter to spread the word about the dangers of prescription pain medication , as well as lobbied the @entity179 for stricter laws about prescription pain medication			2
' we do n't have a recovery story , but we want others to have it , ' @entity103 said			0
@entity33 's film focuses on a girl named ' @entity156			0
' there are many differences between the character of @entity156 and @entity16 - @entity156 injects her drugs while @entity16 typically snorts hers - but the story of the pain caused by addiction is representative of many stories in southern @entity5			1
