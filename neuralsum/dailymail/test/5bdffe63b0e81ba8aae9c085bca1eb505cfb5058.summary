for decades , sheds have a been a place that men build at the bottom of the garden so they have a place to be alone			2
in the book ' @entity7 , ' the author @entity6 called the wooden buildings a " male necessity " - somewhere were they could do some woodwork , pot some plants or even just read the newspaper in peace			0
but now the female sex and demanding a place at the bottom of the garden to call their own - a she shed			1
but while most men might be content with a leaky old shack made of rotting timber , female customers are looking for a home away from home			0
they are commissioning sheds in a range of styles from beach huts and gypsy caravans to mock @entity40 pavilions with tiled floors			1
instead of a few upturned apple boxes and an old wireless , the new she sheds are being decked out with @entity46 rugs , cushions , chandeliers and coffee tables			0
some have gone one step further and installed a diner in theirs , complete with working jukebox and fifties - style restaurant booths			0
