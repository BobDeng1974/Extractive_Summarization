by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 18:40 est , 1 september 2012 firm stand : a source says the @entity3 does not want titles changed the @entity3 wants moves to scrap the word ‘ @entity8 ’ from awards such as the obe and @entity11 to be put off until after her reign , it was claimed last night			1
it follows a @entity16 bid to replace ‘ @entity8 ’ with ‘ excellence ’ in the titles of the honours because it is a ‘ jingoistic relic of @entity21 ’s colonial past ’			1
the moved was resisted after @entity23 @entity22 threatened to veto a @entity25 review of the honours system in protest			2
they insisted that there should be no change until at least 2017 , the 100th anniversary of the creation of the @entity11			2
a senior source told @entity33 that the @entity3 believes honours should stay the same , and any future changes should be dealt with when prince @entity36 accedes to the throne			1
‘ i have been told that her view is , “ if it really must be changed , can you please wait until i am no longer @entity41 ? ” ’ said the source			0
@entity42 last night said : ‘ we have no comment on speculation as to @entity3 ’s views on the continued inclusion of the word “ @entity8 ” in the honours system			1
’ senior @entity23 mp @entity50 , chairman of the @entity52 , which investigated the honours system , said last night : ‘ if this is the @entity3 ’s view , it is personally understandable			1
' an “ @entity60 ” sounds wet and is the kind of thing that must make her heart sink			0
it would have been unthinkable when she ascended the throne and would have had her father and grandfather spinning in their graves			1
’ ' her father would turn in his grave ' : the queen , seen here with prince @entity73 yesterday , has indicated that a change should be avoided at any cost whilst she sits on the throne mr @entity50 said prince @entity36 should have the final say if similar reforms were proposed when he succeeds the @entity3			1
‘ whatever changes are made in the future , the views of the sovereign must be paramount and take precedence over those of politicians , ’ he said			0
mr @entity50 said he favoured retaining ‘ @entity8 ’ , but added that if it were to go , it could be changed to @entity88			1
‘ the transition from the @entity8 to the @entity90 is one of the greatest achievements of the @entity93 and to recognise that in awards would be much more in keeping with the tradition and heritage of the honours system , ’ he added			2
@entity11 : ' @entity11 ' would become officer of @entity21 excellence ' sharp divisions opened up during a @entity52 inquiry into the honours system over whether ‘ @entity8 ’ should remain in the @entity11 – which includes , in order of seniority , the @entity11 or @entity11 ( knight commander or @entity106 ) , @entity11 ( commander of the @entity109 ) , @entity11 ( officer of the @entity109 ) and @entity11 ( member of the @entity109 )			1
@entity111 @entity16 mp @entity110 said the order , created in 1917 , was an outdated ‘ relic ’ of the ‘ jingoism of a country at war ’			0
he said that it should be replaced by ‘ excellence ’ – or renamed the @entity119			2
however , conservatives refused to agree to the idea and threatened to pull the plug on the entire report			0
mr @entity110 and fellow @entity16 mp @entity124 issued their own rebel ‘ minority report ’ in protest			0
the @entity3 has a direct personal link to the @entity8 : her father , @entity129 , was the last @entity130 , losing the title in 1947 when the country was granted independence			1
the hardline decision by mr @entity50 ’s committee to block any change – or even a review – into the matter marked a u-turn			2
when the same committee studied it before the last election , it questioned the continued use of the word ‘ @entity8 ’			2
in its latest report , mps said they had heard ‘ mixed evidence ’			0
former @entity16 chancellor @entity150 told the inquiry : ‘ we do not have one [ an empire ]			0
we are making someone a commander of the @entity109 and we are in no position to offer him such a command			0
’ but @entity156 , the @entity157 in the @entity158 , pointed out that when the obe was created , the statutes made it clear that for any changes to take place , the order would have to be closed and a new one created			0
the report concluded : ‘ we do not recommend any changes ahead of the order ’s centenary in 2017			0

@entity3 wants change *postponed* until prince @entity36 ascends the throne
change from @entity8 to excellence would ' have her father and grandfather spinning in their graves '
