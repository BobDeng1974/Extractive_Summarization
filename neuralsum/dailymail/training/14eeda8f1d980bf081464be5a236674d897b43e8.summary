amid the post-match excitement of wednesday night ’s stunning @entity4 victory in @entity5 , @entity0 suggested @entity6 are now among the best teams in the world			1
in @entity10 and even in @entity5 itself , there will be many who disagree			2
certainly this year ’s @entity4 has seen the very worst of @entity14 ’s team at times			1
when they have been bad , they have been horrid			2
in four games against @entity19 and @entity20 , for example , they won once			2
big results can turn seasons , though , and , for perhaps the first time under @entity14 , @entity6 now have a very big @entity25 result behind them			1
@entity0 scored in the second half at the @entity27 as @entity6 secured their place in the last 16 @entity0 fired in from long range in the 60th minute as @entity6 secured a crucial 2 - 0 victory to advance into the last 16 the 2 - 0 victory in the @entity27 not only completed a remarkable back - from - the - brink story that began with @entity35 ’s two late goals against @entity36 in their penultimate group game , it will have given them a little of the self - belief that can carry teams an awful long way in knockout competitions			1
‘ i ’ll be biased , of course , but for me we have one of the best teams in the world , ’ said @entity0 , scorer of @entity6 ’s first goal on wednesday			1
‘ we just have to show it now			2
‘ i think , when you go through , with all the difficulties we had , it ’s a miracle			2
we had only two points after four games			2
‘ but we did it and we can go as far as possible			2
we just have to be lucky in the draw			2
’ as @entity0 spoke , team - mate @entity56 stood nearby and expressed his own wish that @entity6 avoid the big @entity59 teams in the draw for the last 16 of the competition			1
@entity61 added a late second for @entity6 as they moved into the knockout stages ‘ i prefer anyone else , ’ said @entity56			1
‘ i do n’t want any one of them			2
the later you play a @entity59 team , the better , no ? ‘ they ’re all so good that , if you get one , you may as well get one of the others			2
it would be a difficult draw			0
but every team that gets through now , they ’re difficult			0
‘ no matter who we get we have to be 100 per cent and have to get a little luck too			0
’ @entity56 ’s candour was interesting and it ’s hard to disagree with the rationale			0
@entity6 , on the evidence of the season so far , would appear to be some way behind the likes of champions @entity84 and @entity86 , who knocked them out last year			1
@entity14 ’s team remain fundamentally hard to judge			0
as modest as they have been at times this season , they showed a resilience not always associated with them against @entity20 and we saw performances from central defender @entity95 and midfielder @entity96 to suggest they may finally be growing into life at their new club			1
@entity56 is keen on avoiding a @entity59 side in the next round of the @entity4 @entity35 and @entity102 were among the players missing for @entity6 against @entity20 with injured players to come back at various stages over the coming weeks , there is much to suggest that @entity6 will get better			1
but can they realistically expect to compete with @entity108 ’s best and overhaul @entity107 at the top of the @entity110 ? ‘ i just think you want too much from us , ’ said @entity0 , peculiarly			1
‘ like you said , if you qualify for the next stage of this , and you are just three points behind @entity107 , when a week ago everyone was comparing them to the @entity118 from @entity119 , everyone saying they were unbeatable and stuff like that , then it means we are not that bad			1
‘ the thing is last season we were smashing every team 6 - 1 , 6 - 0 , 5 - 0 , but everyone has studied all the teams , it ’s not the same any more			0
‘ and you have a couple of injured players and a couple of key players who are not at their best so , you know , we just show that as a team we can perform			0
’ ‘ i think it was really important to perform without three or four of our main players			0
‘ any other team would struggle so it was important			0
we have made a lot of progress in the past few weeks			0
@entity6 manager @entity14 smiles after a job well done for his team at the @entity27 ‘ it ’s been three weeks where we have performed really well , like we did at this time last year			1
it ’s maybe a coincidence that it was at the same period last year that we produced our best results			0
‘ but it was important to perform , it was important to go through , because of the ambition of the squad and the club			0
we did it as a team , that ’s the most important thing			0
’ @entity6 now have six wins from six games			1
performances recently against teams such as @entity161 and @entity162 in the @entity110 have been convincing and a visit to @entity164 offers further opportunity to bolster new - found belief			0
certainly they will miss @entity35 , while it will be interesting to see if @entity169 ’s suggestion that @entity102 may struggle to find a way back into the team is borne out			1
it would be surprising if it is			0
what is perhaps more important is that @entity6 now have a statement @entity25 result behind them			1
every team — every manager — needs one			0
from here , anything can happen			0
asked how good @entity6 can be , @entity0 was circumspect			1
‘ i do n’t know , ’ he said			0
‘ when we are able to have all of these players available , we will see how good we are			0
’ @entity6 keeper @entity183 is hoping his team can finally reach their potential after four seasons in @entity108			1

@entity0 and @entity61 goals secured a place in the last 16 of the @entity4 for @entity6
@entity6 *bounced* back from an awful start in @entity192 to qualify
@entity183 is hoping @entity6 can finally come of age in @entity108
