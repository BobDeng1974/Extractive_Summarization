by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 18 september 2013 free school meals are to be extended to all infant pupils in @entity4 at a cost of £ 600million a year			1
@entity6 will announce today that from next september an extra 1.5million children will qualify for the meals , regardless of their parents ’ income			1
the deputy prime minister will tell the @entity13 conference that the policy – which will save even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child – was his price for agreeing to @entity20 plans for a tax break for married couples , worth about £ 150 a year			1
treasury sources said it would be funded through spending cuts elsewhere , but critics questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all young children , while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better - off			1
one senior @entity20 said it was ‘ an appalling waste of £ 600million of taxpayers ’ money ’ and a ‘ deal done on the back of a fag packet ’			1
mr @entity6 ’s announcement at 5pm came only two hours after treasury chief secretary @entity62 had told the conference : ‘ there ’s no spending bonanza around the corner			2
’ currently , free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families			2
extending them to all reception , year one and year two pupils is part of what the @entity13 called a ‘ straight up and down deal ’ with the @entity76 that will mean them agreeing to a similar sum to be spent on a tax break for married couples			1
tour : the deputy pm visited the school in @entity84 near @entity85 ahead of his announcement on free meals , which will only apply in @entity4 mr @entity6 will tell delegates in @entity85 : ‘ my ambition is that every primary school pupil should be able to sit down to a hot , healthy lunch			2
‘ over the course of a year , families spend over £ 400 on lunch money for each child			1
i am determined to do all we can to help put money back in the pockets of these families			0
have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others , with a tax break for married couples			1
a tax break for some , funded through the taxes of others			1
‘ that tells you everything you need to know about their values			0
we , however , will help all families in these tough times , not just the kind we like best			0
’ but @entity20 sources dismissed the idea of a ‘ deal ’ over marriage tax breaks , pointing out that the @entity124 struck in 2010 committed the @entity13 to abstaining on that issue			1
healthy : mr @entity6 will argue that pupils who have school meals are healthier and achieve more academically learning : pupils who eat a free school meal were two months ahead of children who did not in pilot schemes visit : mr @entity6 was joined by wife @entity24 on meeting children at @entity135 , in @entity84 near @entity85 announcement : the @entity13 conference draws to a close in @entity85 on wednesday restaurateur @entity139 proposed free school meals in a review for the government earlier this year			1
mr @entity139 , co-founder of the @entity144 chain , said : ‘ i am in @entity145 right now , and frankly i cried when i heard			0
this is ground - breaking stuff			0
’ but former @entity148 welfare minister @entity147 said the money could be better spent on support for disadvantaged children before they reached school age			2
‘ if one was looking for ways to ensure every child fulfils his potential , this would fall early in the debate , ’ he said of the meals policy			2
‘ this has more than a little of the smell of 1950s political gravy about it			0
’ in pilot areas where free school meals have been extended to all , including @entity167 and parts of @entity169 , students were found to be on average two months ahead of peers elsewhere			2
quite the likeness : a bust of @entity6 is finished by a 3d printer at the @entity175 stand at the @entity176 at the @entity177 in @entity85 @entity178 , of the @entity180 think - tank , said : ‘ there was me thinking we had huge public borrowing			0
' the poorest children are already eligible for free school meals – the main beneficiaries of this new universal benefit will be middle and upper - income households , who really do n’t need a public subsidy			0
’ @entity192 , of the @entity193 ’ @entity191 , blasted the move as a ‘ conference gimmick ’ , while @entity196 , of the @entity197 , said : ‘ this is an enormously bad use of public money			0
’ however , @entity201 ’s director of @entity203 poverty , @entity204 , said : ‘ this will have a huge impact on the lives of tens of thousands of children in @entity4			0
for many children , a school meal will be the only decent hot meal they get			0
’ the @entity212 said pupils of all ages should qualify , adding : ‘ children do not stop being hungry at seven			0
