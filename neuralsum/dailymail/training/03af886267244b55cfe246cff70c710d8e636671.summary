@entity1 ceo @entity0 has come out as gay for the first time , declaring his sexual orientation is one of the ' greatest gifts @entity7 has given me '			1
mr @entity0 , 53 , said he had been open with many people about his sexuality for years but wanted to maintain a level of privacy in the public sphere			1
however , in a first - person article for @entity14 , he said he hopes coming out will inspire people to insist on their right to equality - and that is ' worth the trade - off with my own privacy '			2
the declaration makes mr cook the highest - profile business ceo to have come out as being gay			1
' being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day			2
' it ’s made me more empathetic , which has led to a richer life			0
' he added : ' if hearing that the ceo of @entity1 is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is , or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone , or inspire people to insist on their equality , then it ’s worth the trade - off with my own privacy			2
' part of social progress , mr @entity0 explained , is understanding that a person is not defined by singular characteristics like their sexuality , and urged readers to remember that he is also engineer , an uncle , a nature lover , a fitness nut , a son of the @entity66 , a sports fanatic , and many other things			1
but he conceded that he is part of a minority that could greatly benefit from his support			0

@entity79 , he said , ' has changed so much since i was a kid ' and is moving towards equality , something helped by brave public figures that had come out and changed public perceptions			2
mr @entity0 , pictured at @entity85 on june 29 , said coming out was n't ' an easy choice ' because he guarded his privacy but ' if hearing that the ceo of @entity1 is gay can help someone , then it 's worth the trade - off with my own privacy ' a tweet from mr @entity0 on june 29 congratulating his thousands of employees who part in the gay pride parade nonetheless , with laws still in place across the @entity79 that make sexuality a sack - able offense , he said being gay has given him a ' deeper understanding ' of what it means to be a minority			1
it had also made him more confident in his own identity , helped him ' rise above adversity and bigotry ' and to develop the ' skin of a rhinoceros ' that it takes to run a company like @entity1			2
the motivation to write this article was inspired by the pictures on his office wall of @entity114 and dr @entity115 , who said : ' life ’s most persistent and urgent question is , " what are you doing for others ? " ' while not considering himself an ' activist ' , mr @entity0 said he realizes how much he had benefited from the ' sacrifice of others ' so knew he needed to speak out			1

the company , he said , holds up dr @entity115 and @entity114 as icons for that ideal			0

' all it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that i ’m doing my part , however small , to help others			0

speaking about how former ceo of @entity178 became the first person at a @entity181 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay , mr @entity170 said there 's a ' corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going public			1

then co-host mr @entity165 piped up , saying , ' i think @entity0 is fairly open about the fact he ’s gay at the head of @entity1 , is n’t he ?
