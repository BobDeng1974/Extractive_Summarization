from stockpiling extra cash to possibly authorizing advances to customers who rely on federal benefit payments , banks are working out how to help customers cope should the federal budget impasse not be resolved by next week			1
currently partially curtailed , all federal government activities will come to a complete halt in nine days should @entity9 and @entity10 not come to a budget agreement that includes raising the debt ceiling			2
with the government expected to run out of money october 17 , many @entity13 are nervous about what the impact will be to them , and banks are taking steps to make sure customer needs are met			1
working from a playbook : a number of banks are working out contingency plans to help customers should federal benefit payments halt next week as a result of a full government shutdown an unidentified bank began upping cash reserves at retail branches by at least 20 per cent last week , according to a senior banking executive who spoke to the @entity33			1
the extra cash is likely coming from financial institutions such as @entity35 and @entity36 selling government bonds , the @entity33 reported			1
this action is a strong signal that @entity41 ’s faith in @entity42 is diminishing			0
that same bank is also planning to ensure customers ’ who rely on payments from @entity47 or similar programs will be able to overdraft their accounts without incurring fees , the executive further divulged			1
interest - free cash advances are also being considered in the event benefit payments are delayed , the executive noted			1
endangering the masses : banks are fielding many concerns from customers and are working to ensure customers are affected as little as possible part of what the @entity61 referred to as a ‘ playbook , ’ the measures were first conceived in 2011 as a government default loomed in the waning days of summer			1
stockpiling cash at retail banking branches is being done should customers decide that stuffing money in mattresses is better than leaving it in accounts no longer insured by the @entity71			2
the @entity71 insures up to $ 250,000 worth of deposits			0
should the borrowing limit not be raised , the @entity13 government ’s obligations will exceed its ability to pay , forcing the government into a first - ever default			1
let 's make a deal : president @entity81 signaled a willingness to make concessions during a tuesday news conference most experts agree that a breach of the debt ceiling would lead to grave consequences , including a freeze in credit , severe drops in securities markets , and a global economic downturn as bad – if not worse - as 2008 ’s @entity94			0
failure to raise the debt ceiling would lead to a ‘ very , very severe recession with no obvious way out , ” @entity96 chief economist @entity95 told the @entity101			0
‘ not only might the economic consequences of default be profound , ’ the @entity108 wrote last week in a report , ‘ those consequences , including high interest rates , reduced investment , higher debt payments , and slow economic growth , could last for more than a generation			0
’ despite these dire predictions , some in @entity113 are taking a laissez - faire approach to resolving the issue			0
extra cash : many banks are fearful that customers will withdraw increased amounts of cash to sit on should the government default ( though pictured here , there is not indication @entity124 is taking such action ) @entity128 @entity10 @entity127 has compared economists to weather forecasters			1
' economists , what have they been doing ? they make all sorts of predictions , ' mr @entity127 said			0
' many times they ’re wrong , so i do n’t think we should run government based on economists ’ predictions			2
' @entity142 @entity10 @entity141 said global financial markets would stabilize , should a default occur			0
president @entity81 , in remarks tuesday from the @entity146 , signalled a willingness to compromise , admitting he ’d be open to a short - term budget while a longer - term solution is worked out			0
‘ we recognize , ' mr @entity81 conceded , ' that there are going to have to be some compromises between the @entity9 position and the @entity10 position			0
’ the government has nine days to avoid a potential economic calamity , but the nation ’s banks are not standing idly by during another looming default .			2

@entity13 banks are preparing contingencies in the event of a @entity13 government default
some banks are stocking at least 20 per cent extra cash in the event of a run on deposits
others are considering allowing no - fee overdrafts to @entity47 payment *reliant* customers
