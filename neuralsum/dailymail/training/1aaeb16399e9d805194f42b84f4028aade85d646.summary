by @entity0 last updated at 1:46 pm on 12th december 2011 scientists used to believe that @entity2 permanently turned ' one face ' towards the @entity4 - with one side scorchingly hot and the other cold			2
a @entity2 ' day ' was believed to be the same as the planet 's year			0
but radar scans of the planet revealed that this was n't the case - the planet wobbles round three times for every two circuits it makes round the sun. why the planet had escaped the ' tidal locking ' of the @entity4 's gravitational pull - the same force that makes our moon face one way towards the @entity23 - had been a puzzle			0
now scientists have fingered a likely culprit - a huge asteroid			0
@entity2 , as seen from @entity28 : now scientists believe that the tiny planet 's wobbly orbit could be due to impact with an asteroid big enough to leave a ' basin ' in its surface the tiny planet is so close to the sun that it should be tidally locked to the sun - such orbits are ' highly stable ' , say scientists			1
now scientists believe an asteroid impact may have ' pushed ' the planet into its current wobbly orbit			0
the study , published in the journal @entity43 , says that the planet 's unusual orbit could have been caused by an asteroid impact so huge that it left a basin in the planet 's surface			2
the scientists , led by @entity51 , speculate that the wobble could be caused by ' large , basin - forming impact event ' - potentially , the planet 's odd orbit could be explained by hollows detected in its surface			1
@entity2 is the innermost planet in the solar system - and it would make sense for the tiny planet to be ' tidally locked ' to the sun , with one ' day ' being the same as the planet 's ' year '			1
but it is n't - and scientists have been puzzled as to why @entity68 's messenger spacecraft is currently in orbit around the planet , and has already provided far ' fuller ' scans of the surface , than the last visitor , @entity28 , which flew past in 1975			1
@entity28 10 only captured partial views of the surface			0
@entity51 and her colleagues are hopeful that @entity79 , which continues to orbit the planet , will unearth a likely crater that could explain why the planet orbits as it does			0
the messenger probe captured the first ' full day ' image of @entity2 's surface earlier this year - could one of the impact craters shown be the reason the planet ' wobbles ' round the sun ?			1

tiny planet should be ' tidally locked ' to sun , say scientists - with one face permanently facing *inwardsm* , like our @entity97
@entity101 orbit caused by ' large , basin - forming impact event '
@entity68 's messenger probe may unearth likely impact points , say scientists
