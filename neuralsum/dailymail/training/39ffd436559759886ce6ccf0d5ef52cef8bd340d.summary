by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if it ’s any consolation to @entity3 , the man he will face in the suffocating heat of @entity6 a week on saturday touched down in @entity7 in the early hours on friday with enough problems of his own			0
@entity10 ’s @entity9 have not won in seven games since beating the @entity12 in @entity13 in september			1
even for a country renowned for coming to the boil slowly before major tournaments , it is a worrying scenario			0
‘ @entity24 ’ was the main headline in the @entity19 after wednesday ’s shock 1 - 1 draw with @entity22 , ranked 112th in the world			1
video : scroll down to see @entity27 's reaction to @entity9 's drab draw with @entity22 down but not out : @entity27 falls to the floor during @entity9 's draw with @entity22 ‘ same @entity9 before the @entity32 , one goal and a draw even against @entity22 ’ declared @entity31			1
‘ where will victory come from ? ’ was the simple question on the front page of @entity37 with a picture of @entity27 with his eyes squeezed shut			0
a more pertinent question might be : where will the goals from ? plenty to think about : @entity10 's side have not won in seven games , leaving @entity27 frustrated much depends on @entity27 but the @entity49 know enough about their combustible striker to realise that is dangerous , not least because rumours persist that the former @entity54 man is struggling with a groin problem			1
@entity3 is certainly not the only one wrestling with issues over his strikers			0
@entity10 ’s decision to omit @entity60 from his squad and include @entity62 has sparked a national debate			2
of his others front men , @entity64 is considered too inexperienced and @entity67 unpredictable			0
dejected : @entity67 is slumps on the deck after @entity9 were helf by @entity22 @entity70 , arguably @entity9 ’s strongest area , has been hit by the broken leg suffered by @entity73			1
@entity10 has been forced to ditch his 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 formation — with @entity73 sat behind the front two — and go back to the drawing board			2
on wednesday , he tried 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 for the first time but it clearly did not work , with @entity9 ’s midfield failing to get forward to provide enough support for @entity27			1
@entity9 have been here before , underachieving before a @entity32 only to find their form at the right time			2
but the pain of an early exit in @entity85 four years ago is too fresh for their fans to take anything for granted			0
reason to be cheerful : @entity3 prepares his @entity91 side to face an @entity49 team in turmoil			0

@entity10 's struggling side are without a win in seven games
@entity9 have *n't* won since beating @entity12 in @entity13 in september
@entity9 held to *embarrassing* draw with lowly @entity22 on wednesday
