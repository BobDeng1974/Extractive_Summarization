by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 23:48 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 05:43 est , 2 september 2012 a @entity3 teenager has struck a blow for female equality by becoming the first girl in the state to play football as a quarterback alongside her male classmates			2
@entity11 has long been training with the boys , and on friday she had her moment of glory when she took the field towards the end of a game for @entity18			1
the 17 - year - old 's school was winning 31 - 14 when she entered the arena with just a few moments left			1
a state first : many females have played football in @entity3 , but only one has assumed the role of signal - caller a historical hand - off : @entity11 becomes the first female in the storied history of high school football - crazed @entity3 to play quarterback with the crowd cheering , ' @entity11 ! @entity11 ! @entity11 ! ' and her proud parents looking on , she closed out the contest with a hugely symbolic hand - off			1
afterwards @entity11 said : ' i have always wanted to play football ever since i was a little kid			1
parents said , " it was too rough for you			2
" ' i have nothing to say - i am just out here to prove myself , i am just going to prove by doing on the field			1
' her mother talked of her joy at seeing the girl achieve her dream			2
' my heart starts racing so excited for her and for all this attention for her today , ' @entity50 told @entity53			0
' she has these great abilities and i knew she could do this			0
i just wanted her to be able to prove it			0
' history made : @entity11 takes the field for her high school team in the final seconds of her team 's friday contest @entity62 : @entity11 's mom said she had never had a doubt that her daughter could do anything to which she applies herself the 17 - year - old is a backup quarterback for the @entity68 , in @entity69 , @entity3 , near @entity70			1
the teen has been practicing with the team since may and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the @entity68 game on august 24 , calling plays and completing two passes , a sign that more field time could be in the cards during the upcoming season			1
unfortunately , the game had to be called off early , with 2:43 remaining , due to heavy lightening in the area and the @entity68 lost to @entity84 , 35 - 20			1
' i could n't take the smile off my face , ' she told the @entity89 about her field play last week			0
' the other players have been great			0
after the game , they shook my hand and said it was great i was playing football			0
' a basketball star in her own right , @entity50 was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained , her natural talent for the sport became evident			0
@entity68 football coach , @entity101 , observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born			1
warm up tosses : @entity106 readies herself for her big moment before the game , which her school won 31 - 14 no special treatment : @entity50 's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship , insisting that she has to hold her own football in @entity3 is like a religion			1
the @entity118 has been a breeding ground for @entity121 greats like @entity122 , @entity123 and current up - and - comer @entity125 qb @entity124			1
the state is joined by @entity127 and @entity128 in producing the most @entity121 players			0
though high school football has seen female participation in the past , most have been in spots like kickers , receivers , defensive backs and offensive linemen ( or linewomen )			0
rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team			1
logistically speaking , @entity50 joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room			1
she changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room , on the other side of her school			0
off the field : @entity11 ( left ) says her older sister @entity150 ( right ) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys ' she does n't ask for any special treatment , ' coach @entity101 said about his no - nonsense approach to incorporating @entity50			1
' she 's not trying to show anybody up , she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way , that 's on him , not on her			1
' ' she 's got to walk in the middle of [ the football huddle ] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do , ' the coach added			1
state records show a total of 523 female floridians have taken to the field in high school football since 1973			0
in 2011 , a total of 36 girls played for teams across the state			1
' we 've had girls in @entity3 that had the ability to [ play quarterback ] , but they never have , ' @entity177 , a @entity3 high school football analyst , told the @entity89			0
' you have to give her credit			0
i 've never seen anything like this before , ' he said			0
leader : as qb , @entity11 has had to earn the respect of her teammates ' they better listen to her ... and they do , ' her coach said @entity11 said her older sister , @entity150 , thinks she is crazy , but ' i just think this is so much fun , ' she said			1
' i 've played flag football since the fourth grade			1
scoring on boys is really fun , just to see their reactions , see the coaches get mad			0
i 'll be nervous , yeah			0
but this is like any other game			0
you just have to get in the zone and play			0
' despite @entity11 's enthusiasm , her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries			1
as a veteran athlete , the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team , including a broken nose , a broken finger and multiple concussions			2
' i 've often joked that i wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on , ' @entity222 , @entity11 's mother , said			1
' she 's no weakling and i think i have confidence after seeing her strength			2
but of course my greatest fear is injury , ' the concerned mom added			0
and her mom is n't the only one concerned for her safety			0
@entity236 lineman @entity235 said that having a girl on the team makes the defensive line feel like they need to step it up			2
from the court to the field : the 17 - year - old high school senior got her start on the basketball team ' i see her like a sister and you would n't want nobody to hurt your sister , ' @entity235 said			1
' since she 's a girl , you do n't want her to get hurt , ' @entity235 said			2
' we want to have more protection for her			0
' coach @entity101 has assured her parents that she 'll have minimal field time , and would only be brought in to play when the game is going favorably for the team , to avoid unnecessary roughness			2
with all the fanfare surrounding her athletic pursuits , the teenager insists that it is n't all about sports to her			0
‘ as important as playing basketball is in my life , school and my education are a priority , ’ she wrote in her profile on a local sport 's recruiting website			2
adding that her motto is ‘ work and train hard , both on the court and in the classroom			0
it is as important to take care of your body as it is your mind			0
' despite her tough - guy approach on the field , @entity11 is n't afraid to show her girly side			1
after her momentous field time in a preseason contest last week , her coach encouraged her to take off her helmet to greet the crowd as she exited the field ' coach , my hair 's all messed up , ' she said in protest			2
' do n't worry , ' he said ' you just played football			2

@entity11 , 17 , played in a fourth - quarter *mop* - up role in her team 's winning effort on friday
