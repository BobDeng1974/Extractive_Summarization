by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 14 june 2012 when @entity2 went into sudden labour at home , she must have been just a little concerned that the only person to hand was her five - year - old son , @entity5			1
but the youngster proved a more - than - able replacement for a midwife when he not only helped to deliver his newborn brother , but saved his life as well			1
after comforting his mother through the birth , calling for help and bringing towels to swaddle the baby , he jumped into action when @entity18 was n't breathing and untangled the umbilical cord from around his neck as his mother revived him			1
' my little superhero ' : @entity24 with her five - year - old son @entity5 , who helped to deliver his baby brother @entity18 ( centre ) when she went into sudden labour at their home in @entity31 mrs @entity2 has dubbed her eldest son her ' little superhero ' for his bravery and quick - thinking under pressure			1
the 28 - year - old , from @entity31 , @entity37 , said : ' i really believe @entity5 helped to save @entity39 's life			2
if he had n’t unlooped the cord from around his neck , i would have had to try to do it myself on my own and we would have lost valuable time			0
' @entity39 was choking and @entity5 knew just what to do			2
i 'm so proud of him , he was so calm and collected			0
he was absolutely fantastic and i completely underestimated him			1
' @entity2 described how all through her pregnancy , @entity5 had been excited to meet his new brother or sister so it was no surprise that he was so helpful when the time came for him to deliver his new sibling			1
leapt into action : as well as comforting his mother during the birth , @entity5 helped save his newborn brother 's life by untangling the umbilical cord around his neck she said : ' he came with me to buy all the baby clothes and all the equipment and he came with me to all the scans			1
he was so excited to find out he was getting a little brother and he picked the name @entity39 himself			0
' he was my little helper around the house and whenever i got stressed he would say , " calm down , mummy			0
' after a normal pregnancy , @entity2 felt her first contractions on tuesday , may 8 , following a party with one of @entity5 ’s friends at a local children 's centre			1
on returning to @entity2 's stepfather @entity76 's house , she felt her first contraction and they steadily continued every 10 minutes			2
telling her mum , @entity79 , 48 , that the labour had started , @entity76 took @entity2 home to change while her mother gathered her things from her own house nearby			1
the plan was for @entity76 , 61 , to pick everyone up and drive to the hospital before returning home with @entity5 to await news of the birth			2
loves him to bits : @entity5 has an even stronger bond with his baby brother and is always showing him off at this point , said @entity2 , no one was worried as the hospital had told them they had plenty of time			1
@entity2 said : ' as i was speaking to the nurse over the phone , my contractions jumped from every 10 minutes to every six minutes , but she said not to worry and to ring her back in an hour			2
' i 'd had quite a straightforward labour with @entity5 so we were all expecting this one to be much the same			2
nevertheless i still wanted to head into the hospital as soon as possible			0
' @entity5 had a bath and so did i , but as my stepdad was getting him into his pyjamas i felt my waters break on the stairs			2
i told him to hurry and get my mum , who only lives down the road , and to come back as fast as he could			0
' feeling like she needed the loo , @entity2 went to the bathroom			2
but when she saw bleeding she panicked and called for @entity5			0
in a flash , the little boy had run to get her phone and as @entity2 dialled @entity5 waited for his grandmother to pick up			1
but then all of a sudden , @entity2 was holding her newborn son in her hands			0
helping him into this world : @entity2 said @entity5 had been excited to meet his new brother or sister all throughout her pregnancy @entity2 said : ' @entity5 was comforting me the whole way through and got towels to wrap the baby in			1
' i could hear mum over the phone saying , " yes , we know , mummy ’s having a baby " and i remember @entity5 replying , " no , the baby ’s here ! the baby 's here ! " ' unfortunately @entity39 was not breathing and @entity2 , using sheer instinct , sucked his mouth and nose to clear it			1
the baby started to breathe , but then began to choke as the cord had become looped around his neck			0
@entity2 said : ' i said , " oh no , @entity5 , the cord ! " and he asked me first if he was allowed to touch it and then quickly untangled it from around his head			1
' from where i was sitting on the bathroom floor , hunched against the sink , i would n’t have been able to do it myself with just one hand free			0
i really believe he helped to save his life			0
' at that moment @entity2 ’s parents arrived and soon after the paramedics followed			0
after a little wait , the midwife also arrived , allowing @entity79 to cut the cord			0
@entity2 said : ' although @entity5 took her place as my birthing partner , she was glad that she still got to do that while @entity5 went and had a look at the ambulance with the paramedics			1
' @entity5 absolutely adores his little brother and when i take @entity39 out he stands there proudly , showing him off			1
they would always have had a bond as brothers but i think it ’s been made stronger by the face @entity5 helped him into the world			0
' to think that at the age of just five he was able to help his mum have a baby and then jump in and help save him like that is amazing			0
' i ’ve always been so careful to drum into what to do if there ’s a fire , what do to in an emergency , when to call 999 but he remembered everything			0
' i think @entity5 might have a future ahead of him as a midwife , but when i asked him he said no , he wants to be a policeman			0

@entity5 only person on hand , but he proved a cool head under pressure
comforted his mother then stepped in when his brother was n't breathing
@entity2 : ' he was absolutely fantastic and i completely underestimated him '
