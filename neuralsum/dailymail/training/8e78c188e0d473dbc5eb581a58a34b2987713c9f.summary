by @entity0 she captured the nation 's attention for all the wrong reasons in december 2008 when she claimed she had been in a seven year long extra-marital affair with celebrity chef @entity6			1
but now @entity7 - who touted herself as a professional mistress after indulging in multiple affairs ( she counts @entity10 among her conquests ) - says she is the ' worm that turned ' after setting up a @entity13 to help woman prevent their husband cheating			1
and controversially , 43 - year - old @entity7 's top tip for wives to ensure the fidelity of a husband is to stop spending so much time in the kitchen and act more like their mistress			1
as a well - known mistress , @entity7 has set up an online help forum called @entity26 to coach women on how to to become their husband 's mistress @entity7 , who is not married herself but is currently dating ( ' only single men ! ' ) believes that men ’s needs are actually very simple , and if women are smart enough , they can satisfy them and stop infidelity creeping into a relationship			1
' it ’s all about " the skills "			0
i call it the @entity40 rule : men need to eat , @entity43 , and @entity44 , ' she says in an exclusive interview with @entity46 ' give them those in abundance and you might just get a monogamous husband.related ] ' yes , it is controversial that i founded this organisation as a well - documented other woman			1
but who better than someone who has been on the inside of infidelity for so many years ? ' i did n't want to be that person anymore			2
i see it as a way of trying to give something back to the world , to try to make up for so many of the wrongs i have done , ' she said			0
@entity7 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , established @entity13 , an online advice forum , after the success of her @entity72 show @entity71 , which followed her on her mission to rescue women caught in the despair of an extra marital affair			1
@entity7 then appeared on hit @entity77 show dr @entity78 and took five mistresses on the show with her to discuss their livelihood ; the show proved to get the best ratings of the entire series			1
@entity7 says she is a changed woman - and despite claiming to have slept with @entity6 ( who , for the record , said of the claim : ' did i have a torrid seven year affair with her ? did i f * * * ! ) now says she sees the school as a way to make up for the wrongs she has done after her success over the pond , she moved back to @entity68 and set up @entity13 , a non-profit making organisation ( ' you ca n't ask women in despair for money ' ) , after hearing from so many wives asking for her advice			1
she now receives a constant flow of emails from wives in despair who worry that their husband is cheating and are desperately seeking tips on how to stop it happening			2
speaking about her latest venture , she said : ' @entity13 found me			2
i was working on my show @entity71 over in @entity72 which highlighted the topic and i had so many wives contacting me for advice			1
@entity7 answers women 's questions when they fear that their husband is having an affair or simply want to spice up their marriage to stop their husband cheating ' the school is geared towards making today ’s marriages more successful and to ultimately lessen the divorce rates , and the subsequent demise to our society ’s structure			1
' any marriage or committed relationship needs daily maintenance and nurturing - people just do n't seem to realise that			0
' marriage should be likened to a high powered job , once you land that job you know you need to show up daily , put a huge amount of effort into your role in order to keep it - and prosper within it - otherwise there is always the risk that someone may come along and take it from you			1
' therefore , if more people treated their marriage as they do their job , more marriages would last the lifetime they are supposed to			0
' @entity7 maintains that she has a hawkeye when it comes to spotting the signs of cheating - and she wants to point them out to other women before it 's too late			1
the self - proclaimed relationship guru maintains that it 's the men who bury their heads in the sand , those who join the gym , change their routine and influences are those having affairs , and she is keen to open women 's eyes to this			2
' do n't allow space in your marriage for other women to walk into , ' she adds			0
her main advice to women is : do more in the bedroom than the kitchen			2
stay up late at night to see how his day went			0
be affectionate and be a good listener			0
' i 'm not a trained professional but i can relate and i know how men lie ; i 've got secrets and tips			0
' her long term plan is to turn her online venture into a physical school for women to engage in self - image lessons , learn communication skills and even fitness tips			2
i believe that the whole @entity190 has to bond together to beat these cheats right out of the sheets , ' she says			0
' a lot of men should worry because i am here to beat the cheats			0
' ' i am here to wake other women up and teach them not to be a mousewife , ' she adds			0
and if all else fails , there ’s always @entity13			0
