the chaps ' view - by @entity1 one of the great mysteries of mankind — and i mean mankind — may have been solved			1
scientists from @entity7 have measured 15,000 penises in 16 countries			1
this work has allowed them , after feeding the findings into computers , making boffinish statistical adjustments , twiddling knobs and squinting at graphs , to announce an average size for chaps ’ undercarriage			1
that , in turn , has been seized on as having psychological significance			1
apparently , we men are now less likely to have a nervous collapse about our own shortcomings			1
@entity1 says that @entity26 ’s 16th century statue of the naked @entity27 ( pictured ) , can sometimes be a source of fun for being a ' tiddler ' we have not been told the logistical ins and out , if that is the term , of this ground - breaking global operation			1
the research demanded at least two readings ( one at ease , one standing to quivering attention ) for each handsome specimen			1
were the laboratory assistants who took the data dreary , middle - aged men speaking in the monotones of @entity46 ( the know - it - all creation of the comedian @entity48 ) ? or were they busty , sultry ladies with husky larynxes and widening eyes ? to what level of exactitude were the measurements taken ? what instruments were employed — school rulers , tape measures , laser micrometers or ( ouch ) cold , industrial calipers ? while we ’re about it , exactly how , in 16 languages , do you say ‘ sorry to interrupt your busy day , monsieur , but would you mind dropping your drawers so that my pouting assistant @entity66 can take the bore and length of your old man ’ ? but back to the conclusions			1
dr @entity72 , the fine body of a man who led the psychiatrists from @entity76 ’s , has announced that the average length of an erect penis is 5.16 in			1
typically , it sounds more in @entity81 centimetres — 13.12 cm. the figure shrivels to 3.6 in when the member is in a state of genial repose			2
if we can place this in context , the late @entity87 ’s spotty schoolboy character @entity86 fretted that his ‘ thing ’ rose to a mere 4.3 in , something that gave the poor lad hours of angst , while the once accepted norm , at least of myth , was nearly half as much again — the old ‘ six inches of proud @entity97 manhood ’			2
@entity26 ’s 16th century statue of the naked @entity27 , sometimes a source of fun for being a tiddler , may not have been so unusual after all			2
you may think it peculiar that i dwell on these matters , not least for what i am about to say : i seriously doubt that many blokes are much concerned by these readings			2
i do not mean that they will not have been interested and amused by yesterday ’s news reports			2
indeed , i bet most of us , when we read the @entity113 , discreetly did some thumbwork to try to work out what 5.16 in looks like , and then had a rough gander below decks to see how we fared by comparison			2
but will men have been psychologically affected ? does size matter to us as it is said to matter , particularly to our wives and girlfriends ? or is this yet another attempt by the medical / psychiatric world to create collywobbles where previously few existed ? dr @entity72 said his findings would ‘ help doctors reassure the large majority of men that the size of their penis is in the normal range ’			1
he said he would ‘ use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position ’			1
another doctor disclosed that some men , poor fellows , suffer from something called body dysmorphic disorder , which can cause a person to have a distorted view of how he looks			1
apparently , this is a serious source of anxiety to some gents , who become convinced they are laughably tiny			2
one does not wish to downplay the gravity of body dysmorphic disorder , which no doubt exists			2
one naturally has sympathy with those who may worry that they have been given short commons in the trouser department by the @entity161			2
but is this perhaps a case of publicly employed scientists going to expensive lengths to investigate a not particularly widespread problem ? is male appendage size quite possibly a false hoo - hah created by society ? it has been said that the late @entity170 @entity171 ( pictured ) had physical difficulty with one of her early husbands , so enormous was his manhood there may be extreme cases of smallness or vastness , where it can create disharmony between men and their sexual partners			1
the late @entity170 @entity171 had physical difficulty with one of her early husbands , so enormous was his manhood			2
wide as a beer can , apparently			2
in the rock music world there was a falling out between @entity188 and @entity189 after @entity190 made public remarks about @entity189 being a little chap			2
and what are we to make of the vast codpieces that bed - hopping @entity195 had made for his suits of armour ? real need or a figment of @entity201 ’s imagination ? only his six wives could have told us			0
but does any of that truly justify a research operation of the size ( dread word ) just carried out by these @entity208 medics ? there was a famous falling out between @entity189 ( pictured ) and fellow @entity211 , @entity212 , after @entity190 made remarks about @entity189 's manhood and anyway , are women really so concerned with measurements ? is there not something more important than size — namely , love ? for millennia , the male member has occupied a curious place			1
immediate riposte : yes , mate , between your legs ! but please , let the class pipe down for a few moments			0
in ancient civilisation , penises were considered to have mythical significance linked to male power and eternity			1
at @entity234 , there is an ancient @entity236 mural of the fertility god @entity237 walking around with the most tremendous todger , as long as a trombone			0
well played , that man			1
closer to home we have the @entity243 in @entity244 , cut into a hillside with his @entity246 riding high			0
the eternity aspect of this symbolism is easily explained and the ability to sire offspring could bestow power , for the more sons you had , the better you were able to defend your household			0
but those were primitive concerns			0
the correlation between penis size and power in the modern era , even 200 years ago , is less persuasive			1
for this information , we can thank a cruel pathologist who allegedly removed his ‘ item ’ after his death and pickled it in formaldehyde			0
it was later auctioned in @entity269			0
@entity270 knows if the object in that jar , indeed , belonged to the 19th century @entity274 emperor , but it was used against him posthumously as a way of diminishing his reputation			0
how trivial and cheap , to mock a great man after his death in such a fashion			1
even if he was on the ‘ petit ’ side , @entity280 was a mighty general with unarguable power			1
from the sublime to the ridiculous , that silly oaf @entity285 suffered something similar when he was caught having an affair with his typist a few years ago			0
i recall a front page of the @entity292 that featured an illustration of a cocktail sausage			0
however , the mockery did not do his reputation harm			0
if anything , it made the one - time deputy prime minister more popular			0
@entity300 , @entity301 ( pictured ) has also been the subject of much speculation thanks to the numerous photos of him advertising underwear last year , a statue of peacocking footballer @entity308 was unveiled in @entity309			0
necks were clutched and faces fanned when it was first shown to the public because the shorts featured an implausibly large bulge			0
our own @entity301 has been the subject of speculation after his numerous poses in underpant adverts			0
he claims he has never stuffed socks down his front to create a bigger impression			0
but if he did , would it matter ? shrinks might say so , but i am unconvinced			0
men know there is not much they can really do to alter the equipment fate has given them			1
women can increase or decrease the size of their busts by visiting a plastic surgeon , but medical science offers men much less chance to vary their dimensions			1
similarly , despite all those baldness cure adverts , there is not much they can do to stop their hairlines receding			0
you just have to accept it and get on with life			0
a statue of footballer @entity308 ( pictured ) was unveiled in @entity309 last year and caused public shock because the shorts featured an implausibly large bulge @entity86 may have agonised about this subject , but he was created by a woman			0
i simply do n’t believe , even in this age of explicit advertisements with endless commercial emphasis on sex , that blokes give much thought to their willy size			1
i attended boarding schools in the @entity359 and barely recall anyone mentioning how well hung they were			0
we did have one boy who was nicknamed ‘ chopper ’ , but that was because he was a notoriously dirty tackler on the football field			0
did we size up one another in the communal showers ? not that i recall			1
mind you , i have always been short - sighted and in showers you naturally have to remove your spectacles			0
if i had been interested in seeing how @entity372 measured up , then i would have had to peer down quite close for a proper gawp , and i ’m not sure that would have been appreciated			1
for all i know , @entity372 is now running a bank and earning millions of pounds a year — a big player one way or another .			0
