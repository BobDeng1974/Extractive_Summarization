@entity1 ' most famous cougar has ' left the building ' after taking up residence in an unsuspecting family 's crawl space			2
the mountain lion , known as p - 22 , left the @entity8 home in the early hours of tuesday , having created quite the media circus in the affluent @entity11 suburb			1
his departure was announced on @entity14 by the @entity15 , which tweeted ' the cougar has left the building ' at 9.28am			2
new home : the lion - known as p - 22 - was found by workers in the crawl space at midday on monday courageous : on tuesday morning , after the cougar 's signal moved away from the area , a couple of brave animal welfare officers decided to conduct a thorough search of the area under the @entity8 home gone : luckily for them , p - 22 had moved away overnight , and was moving back towards the park ' likes ' : the incident has made @entity33 even more famous , with another 1,400 people liking his @entity36 page the lion usually lives in nearby @entity38 , but on monday was discovered in the crawl space of @entity40 and @entity42 's home by an unsuspecting alarm technician			1
' he came out white as a ghost , ' @entity45 's @entity44 told @entity47			0
the house was soon surrounded by a host of media outlets - including a circling helicopter - while a live stream meant @entity1 ' residents could keep an eye on animal services ' attempts to move the lion			1
but @entity58 was not prepared to be moved , despite being poked gently with a long prod â€” which only led to welfare officers temporarily losing the pricey @entity62 camera they 'd attached to the end of it that fell off			0
welfare officers then attempted to fire a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space with hopes that at least the noise and commotion would scare him out , a tactic that often works with coyotes			0
next , they fired small bean bags , the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control , toward the cat			0
resident : the beautiful animal may have been living in the crawlspace for some time before being discovered rescue : attempts to get the lion to move out - including firing tennis balls - were unsuccessful none of it worked , so they asked everyone to clear the area , in the hope that p - 22 might move on his own accord			2
and the tactic worked : the mountain lion , who crossed two freeways when he travelled from the @entity96 to the park more than three years ago , was gone when they returned in the morning			1
but even though the animal 's tracking device - fitted some years ago - was no longer sounding in the area , it was decided it was still best to double check the area was cougar - free			2
so a couple of brave souls entered the crawl space just to make sure			0
fame : @entity33 is best - known for being pictured in front of the @entity11 sign in 2013 hiding : it is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in @entity114 , but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the @entity8 hills luckily for them , @entity33 was heading home - and the most recent tweets reveal he was heading deeper into @entity38			1
' @entity124 adventure is ( literally ) behind him , ' @entity122 's wildlife department tweeted			0
it is n't the first time @entity33 has been the centre of attention , however			1
after he arrived in the 4,000 acre park , @entity130 photographer @entity129 set about trying to capture his picture - finally managing to photograph him walking in front of the @entity11 sign in 2013 , making p - 22 an overnight celebrity			1
indeed , the big cat - who survived mange and a meal of rat poison to become apparently healthy again just last year - even has a @entity36 page in his honour , which has got more than 1,400 more ' likes ' since his recent appearance on tv			0
beanbags : the animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion live feed : the incident has created quite a furore - with people watching it unfold live on television ( pictured )			0
