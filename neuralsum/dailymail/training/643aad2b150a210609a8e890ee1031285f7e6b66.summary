with nearly half of all suicides in the @entity5 military committed with a privately owned firearm , @entity0 and the @entity1 are moving to implement policies that will discourage at - risk members of the armed forces from retaining their personal weapons			1
as suicides continue to rise in 2012 , the @entity12 officials are developing a suicide prevention campaign , part of which will encourage friends and family of the potentially suicidal to convince the soldiers to give up their weapons			1
the @entity1 ’s move would be hugely controversial as some lobbyists may construe it as gun control			1
concern : almost half of all suicides in the @entity5 military are committed with a private firearm , not service weapons gun rights groups – along with many service members themselves - are likely to oppose any policy which could seem to limit a citizen ’s private ownership of a firearm			1
‘ this is not about authoritarian regulation , ’ said dr @entity33 , the assistant secretary of defence for health affairs			0
‘ it is about the spouse understanding warning signs and , if there are firearms in the home , responsibly separating the individual at risk from the firearm			2
’ dr @entity33 said the campaign would also include measures to encourage friends and family of at - risk soldiers to remove possibly dangerous prescription drugs from their homes , but declined to provide any further details			1
another significant step is the fact that @entity0 appear willing to implement legislation which would allow mental health counsellors and commanders to discuss the issues of privately owned weapons with the troops			1
the measure would amend last year ’s legislation , that prohibited the @entity12 from collecting information from members of the armed forces about lawfully owned , personal firearms			0
the measure was part of the @entity72 and was backed by the @entity73			2
the @entity73 claimed the provision was in response to efforts by defence officials to maintain records of all firearms owned by their personnel			2
the new amendment , which is part of the defence authorisation bill for 2013 , has been passed by the @entity83 but not the @entity84			0
it would allow mental health experts and commanders to ask service members about their private firearms if they have ‘ reasonable grounds ’ to believe the soldier is at ‘ high risk ’ of harming himself or others			2
trauma : @entity0 are taking steps to prevent at - risk soldiers from retaining their private weapons the @entity73 are wary over the moves , and have said that , although they are happy for the commanders to ask questions of those they are concerned about , the commanders should not be confiscating firearms			1
‘ we ’re ok with the commanding officer being able to inquire , ’ said @entity105 , a spokesman for the @entity73 , ‘ but they ca n’t confiscate			2
’ senator @entity109 , an @entity111 @entity110 who sponsored the 2011 restrictions , said he would support the new amendment ‘ if it clears up any confusion			0
’ ‘ this is a national tragedy that @entity0 , all branches of @entity1 and numerous outside organizations have been working together to solve , ’ mr @entity109 said			1
the @entity84 is not expected to take the bill until after the general election			0
suicides in the @entity5 military rose rapidly between 2005 and 2009 , and reached 285 active service members , along with 24 reservists in 2009			1
opposition : gun rights lobbyists are likely to oppose any policy that would result in the confiscation of weapons the numbers plateaued in 2010 and 2011 , but the 2012 figures look set to exceed those of 2009 , according to the @entity132			1
as of last month , 270 active - duty service members killed themselves this year alone , and half were from the @entity135			2
more than six out of 10 military suicides are by use of firearms , and nearly half of those involve privately owned guns			0
guns are also the most common method of suicide among young males across the country			0
when troops are identified as high risk , commanders have the authority to confiscate their service weapons , but under current legislation they can not ask them to hand over their personal firearms			1
the rising figures are of greater concern to the military staff considering the efforts from the suicide prevention campaign			1
@entity159 , a helicopter pilot , killed himself in 2005 between deployments in @entity161			0
his wife , @entity162 , said he felt unable to seek help			0
she said : ' he was so afraid of how people would view him once he went for help			0
' ' he thought that people would think he was weak , that people would think he was just trying to get out of redeploying or trying to get out of service , or that he just could n't hack it			0
in reality , he was sick			0
' he had suffered injury in combat and he had also suffered from depression and let it go untreated for years			0

@entity1 and @entity0 to back policies encouraging the separation of at - risk soldiers from their private weapons
suicide rate among @entity5 military staff rising again in 2012 , almost half of those committed with personal firearm
likely to spark opposition from gun rights groups such as @entity73
