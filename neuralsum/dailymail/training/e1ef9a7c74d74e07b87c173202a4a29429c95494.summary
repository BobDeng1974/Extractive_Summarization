@entity0 and @entity1 will need little reminding that the clock is ticking relentlessly on their careers			1
the @entity7 champion is turning 27 and playing in the third round of the @entity9 , while his predecessor will be back at home with his rapidly expanding family , having lost early at his main preparatory event for the @entity14			2
@entity0 has no celebratory plans , just the focus of taking on @entity18 @entity17 for a place in the last eight , a match he earned with an impressive 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 victory yesterday over @entity23 ’s @entity22			1
brit of all right : @entity0 will face @entity17 in the third round in @entity27 after beating @entity22 up for the battle : @entity0 was in good form as he attempts to put together a decent run ahead of @entity7 @entity1 ’s visit to the eternal city turned out to be brief , mounting a third - set comeback before ceding a late match point to lose 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to @entity36 @entity35			1
the great @entity38 ’s career is far more advanced than @entity0 ’s and afterwards he dwelt on how much a defeat can hurt him these days , especially at such a contented time when his twin boys have just arrived			2
‘ at this time i know how much a defeat hurts and how much it does n’t , when it ’s good when it hurts and when it ’s not			0
this one is totally ok if it does n’t hurt , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i tried everything ; you ca n’t do more than that on the court			0
sure , it was n’t fun leaving the court , walking through the corridor and thinking what happened out there , so maybe i was angry and disappointed and frustrated but then i was like : “ ok , let ’s just do the press conference and go home , let ’s not waste too much more time			0
” ’ yellow peril : @entity22 was soundly beaten in @entity9 by the @entity66 no 1 on wednesday heading home : @entity1 departs after losing in three sets to @entity36 @entity35 it was a particularly painful reverse for @entity1 , 32 , who led 6 - 5 in the tiebreak when @entity35 pulled out a freakishly good forehand passing shot			1
two more points and @entity1 was off to the airport where a private jet got him home for bathtime			2
@entity0 ’s @entity14 prospects will start to look a whole lot rosier if he can beat @entity17 , a left - hander against whom he holds a 5 - 0 record			1
having fallen to a listless defeat in @entity83 last week , he cut a totally different figure , calmly handling atrociously windy conditions and playing smartly within himself for a creditable win against the world no 31			0
@entity0 was also unrecognisable from the player who met the same opponent a year ago in the same round , having to pull out at a set all with back problems that forced him out of @entity93			1
he has come here without any specialist physio in his team			0
like @entity1 , he was also reflective about the passage of time			2
relief : @entity23 's @entity99 celebrates as he comes through a tough test against @entity36 's @entity101 ‘ birthdays for me are not the same as when you ’re 12 years old , really			1
i do n’t look forward to them , ’ he said			0
if i go home for a couple of days ( before @entity93 ) i ’ll do something			0
no girlfriend or family or friends here this year ... well , not that i know of			0
maybe they ’ll surprise me			0
’ a win for @entity0 over @entity17 will probably see the @entity114 go on to face @entity99 in the quarters			1
the @entity116 laboured again on wednesday night , but ultimately saw off @entity36 @entity101 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 2 .			1

@entity66 no 1 wins 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 in his @entity119
@entity0 plays left - handed @entity18 @entity17 in third round
@entity1 loses to @entity35 in three sets
@entity99 survives a tough test from @entity101
