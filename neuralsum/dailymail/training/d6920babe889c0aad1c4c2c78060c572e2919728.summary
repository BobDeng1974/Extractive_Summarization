whether @entity29 ( @entity28 ) is going to be up for that remains to be seen , ' said @entity0			2
' it is very difficult nowadays			0
there is a lack of world class strikers and midfield players which control the game , express themselves and that is what i think they miss. they have some good players but they do n't have a special player			1

if you win two or three games in this league and it can turn around			0
the strikers have to start scoring goals , i think then the team can feed off that			0
