by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 31 july 2012 after a marathon campaign the former principal oboist from the @entity2 has proved he was unfairly sacked			2
now judges at the @entity5 have urged the warring woodwind section of the company to return to harmony after they ruled that @entity10 ' @entity9 was unfairly dismissed			0
talented mr @entity9 , 63 , was sacked after 34 years in the ranks of the @entity2 on grounds that the sound of his instrument did not ' blend ' with the rest of the orchestra			1
clash : @entity20 ( left ) was unfairly dismissed , following long term difficulties with @entity22 ( right ) he was made to go through auditions to prove that his instrument was acceptable to the orchestra			0
but the musician claimed his career with @entity2 began to wane following a personality clash with former musical director , @entity22			1
after long - term ' difficulties ' in the relationship between the oboeist and mr @entity22 , mr @entity9 had satisfied assessors , including the then music director , that his ' intonation ' and ' emission of sound ' came up to scratch during auditions			2
@entity38 has finally proved he was unfairly dismissed however , he continued to face criticism of his perceived shortcomings in ' ensemble ' situations and the ' blending of sound ' between his instrument and the orchestra			0
his dismissal came after the @entity2 said that aspect of his playing could not be tested by audition with a pianist to accompany him but only in ' full ensemble conditions '			0
although the @entity2 purported to follow the disciplinary procedure laid down in its handbook , it did not comply with the opera â€™s agreement with the @entity56 , which was designed to protect musicians from ' too subjective an assessment ' of their artistic performance			1
the judge , sitting with @entity61 and @entity62 , said it was ' inevitable ' that it would be found that the disciplinary procedure to which mr @entity9 was subjected for his perceived artistic failings was ' procedurally unfair '			1
@entity65 said : ' to subject mr @entity9 to the handbook disciplinary procedure , minus the requirements of oral , written and final warnings , was procedurally unfair , even if the concern was to save him from additional stress			1
' after today 's decision the case will now return to an employment tribunal for the amount of compensation payable by the @entity2 to mr @entity9 to be assessed			2
however , after pointing to the massive cost of three previous contested hearing , lord justice @entity76 said : ' i hope that the parties will give active consideration to the possibility of a negotiated settlement , if necessary through mediation '			0
after ruling that the disciplinary procedure followed lacked the element of objectivity that would have made it fair , the judge concluded : ' it was not a reasonable response to the problem that had arisen ... i consider that a finding of procedural unfairness is inevitable '			1
battleground : the @entity96 serves as an arts center and housed the @entity2			0

@entity38 , 63 , sacked from orchestra after more than three decades
