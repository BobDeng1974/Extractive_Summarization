clicking ' like ' on @entity1 is constitutionally protected free speech and can be considered the 21st century - equivalent of a campaign yard sign , a federal appeals court ruled wednesday			1
the 4th @entity5 @entity4 in @entity6 reversed a lower court ruling that said merely ' liking ' a @entity1 page was insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection			1
exactly what a ' like ' means – if anything – played a part in a @entity16 case involving six people who say @entity19 sheriff @entity18 fired them for supporting an opponent in his 2009 re-election bid , which he won			1
the workers sued , saying their first amendment rights were violated			2
like it or not : a federal court has ruled that ' liking ' something on @entity1 is constitutionally protected free speech @entity18 said some of the workers were let go because he wanted to replace them with sworn deputies while others were fired because of poor performance or his belief that their actions ' hindered the harmony and efficiency of the office			2
' one of those workers , @entity40 , had ' liked ' the @entity1 page of @entity18 ' opponent , @entity42			2
@entity5 district judge @entity43 in @entity44 had ruled in april 2012 that while public employees are allowed to speak as citizens on matters of public concern , clicking the ' like ' button does not amount to expressive speech			0
in other words , it 's not the same as actually writing out a message and posting it on the site			2
@entity43 acknowledged that other courts have ruled that @entity1 posts are constitutionally protected speech , but he said in those cases there were ' actual statements			0
' simply clicking a button is much different and does n't warrant @entity63 protection , he wrote			0
in his ruling , @entity43 acknowledged the need to weigh whether the employee 's speech was a substantial factor in being fired			1
but the judge wrote that the point is moot if ' liking ' something is n't constitutionally protected speech			0
@entity73 : the 4th @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity16 made the ruling wednesday			1
it stemmed from a suit filed by employees of a sheriff who were fire after hitting ' like ' on his opponent 's page during an election the three - judge appeals court panel disagreed , ruling that ' liking a political candidate 's campaign page communicates the user 's approval of the candidate and supports the campaign by associating the user with it			1
in this way , it is the @entity94 equivalent of displaying a political sign in one 's front yard , which the @entity98 has held is substantive speech			1
' the case was sent back to the lower court			0
@entity1 and the @entity102 , which filed friend of court briefs in the case , applauded wednesday 's ruling			1
' this ruling rightly recognizes that the @entity63 protects free speech regardless of the venue , whether a sentiment is expressed in the physical world or online , ' @entity111 , director of the @entity112 , said in a written statement			0
' the @entity114 does n't distinguish between ` liking ' a candidate on @entity1 and supporting him in a town meeting or public rally			0
' an attorney representing @entity18 , the sheriff , did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment , nor did an attorney representing the employees .			0

the 4th @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity16 gave its ruling wednesday
' *internet* equivalent of displaying a political sign in one 's front yard ' : the case has its roots in a sheriff 's *decision* to fire workers who ' liked ' his political opponents
