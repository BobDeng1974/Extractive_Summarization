excavations of a colossal fortress built by @entity2 have uncovered the palace 's dramatic entrance way			1
the arched entrance and corridor , built around 20 years before the birth of @entity8 , leads to a vestibule or lobby covered with coloured frescoes			1
the palace was built after @entity2 defeated the @entity13 , originally from @entity14 , and decided to build a town and palace on the site 10 miles ( 16km ) south of @entity18 to celebrate his victory			1
the main feature of the entryway is a corridor with a complex system of arches spanning its width on three separate levels the discovery was made by by the @entity23 's @entity22			1
it was part of a wider dig that is ongoing at the @entity26 site in the @entity26			2
the main feature of the entryway is a corridor with a complex system of arches spanning its width on three separate levels			1
thanks to the supporting arches , the 65ft ( 20 metre ) long and 19ft ( 6 metre ) wide corridor has been preserved to a height of 65ft ( 20 metres )			2
@entity23 archaeologists , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , said : ‘ the corridor was built as part of @entity2 's plan to turn @entity26 into a massive artificial volcano - shaped hill , a vast and impressive monument designed to commemorate the architect - king			1
@entity26 is a hill , situated in the @entity26 ( pictured )			0
between 23 and @entity58 , @entity2 constructed a fortress , palace and small town on the cone - shaped mound and was later buried there			1
@entity2 died in @entity64 in spring 4 bc and was said to have been buried on the site @entity2 ( illustrated ) was born around @entity66 and was governor of @entity68			1
he was appointed @entity69 by the @entity71 senate @entity26 is a hilltop fortress situated in the @entity26			0
between 23 and @entity58 , @entity2 constructed a fortress , palace and small town on the cone - shaped mound , and was later buried there			1
@entity2 was born around @entity66 and was governor of @entity68 until @entity76			2
the @entity77 then conquered @entity78 , which was under @entity71 control at the time , and @entity2 fled to @entity18			1
he sought refuge in @entity81 , where his mother was said to have been originally from , and was later appointed @entity69 by the @entity71 senate			0
with @entity71 support , he took back the kingdom three years later , and began building the fortress a decade after that			0
archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors and consisted of four towers - believed to have been where @entity2 lived - as well as frescoes , an aqueduct , elaborate mosaic floors and corridors connected by archways			1
the site is the highest peak in the @entity78 desert , stretching 2,450ft ( 758 metres ) above sea level			0
according to biblical accounts , when news of @entity8 ’ arrival reached the king , he was said to have felt threatened and ordered all newborn babies in @entity106 to be killed			0
the @entity107 portrays him as a tyrant that would stop at nothing to keep his throne			0
in @entity114 , the gospel wrote : ‘ when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in @entity106 , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men			0
’ there were even accounts that the king killed three of his own sons , out of fear of losing his crown			0
however , few other historical accounts of this massacre have been reported			0

his body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress , which archaeologists claimed to have uncovered in 2007 ( pictured right ) @entity2 died in @entity64 in spring 4 @entity58 of an illness dubbed ‘ @entity146 ’ , which is thought to have been a combination of cirrhosis of the liver , hypertension , and diabetes			1
his body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress , which archaeologists claimed to have uncovered in 2007			2
however , last year , experts ruled this location out because the tomb was too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious , large scale architectural projects			0
experts at the time also said the said the building where the tomb was said to have been found has an awkward layout with two staircases above the tomb , and is not symmetrically aligned with the rest of the complex , which would have been a design faux pas not fit for a king			2
they also believe that the ruler , known for his expensive taste , would not have settled for a coffin made of local stones			0
the original palace vestibule , blocked when the corridor became redundant , was also exposed ( pictured )			2
this room was decorated with painted frescoes and also showed signs of the rebel occupation during the @entity179 of 66 to 71 bc. these signs included jewish revolt coins and crude temporary structures ‘ during the course of the excavations , it became evident that the arched corridor was never actually in use , as prior to its completion it became redundant			0
' experts believe that when @entity2 became aware of his impending death in @entity192 , he decided to convert the hilltop complex into a memorial mound and royal burial monument			2
‘ whatever the case , the corridor was backfilled during the construction of the massive artificial hill at the end of @entity2 's reign , ' continued the archaeologists			1
‘ the upper section of a new monumental stairway stretching from the hill 's base to its peak , constructed during the course of this building phase , appears to have been built over it			0
’ the palace was built after @entity2 defeated the @entity13 and decided to build a town on the site 10 miles ( 16km ) south of @entity18 ( marked ) to celebrate his victory the original palace vestibule , blocked when the corridor became redundant , was also exposed			1
the discovery of official clay seals ( pictured ) may prove there was a ruler , or at least government activity , in the region during the 9th century @entity58 for centuries , scholars have either dismissed @entity225 and @entity226 as mythological figures , or disputed the era in which they ruled over the @entity229 , as told in the @entity107			2
but the discovery of six official clay seals may finally prove that there was a ruler in the region during the 9th and 10th century @entity76 although the bullae do n't directly reference @entity225 or @entity226 , they do suggest the presence of a government and political activity during their respective supposed reigns			0
this room was decorated with painted frescoes and also showed signs of the rebel occupation during the @entity179 of 66 to 71 bc. these signs included jewish revolt coins and crude temporary structures			0
in addition , the excavations in the arched corridor also showed evidence of the @entity252 period that took place between 132 and 136 bc. this included a series of hidden tunnels dug on the site by the rebels as part of the guerrilla warfare they waged against the @entity262			1
the archaeologists said : ‘ supported in part by wooden beams , these tunnels exited from the hilltop fortress by way of the corridor 's walls , through openings hidden in the corridor			1
‘ one of the tunnels revealed a well - preserved construction of 20 or so cypress - wood branches , arranged in a cross-weave pattern to support the tunnel 's roof			0
’ @entity278 , director of @entity280 's @entity279 , added : ‘ in the future , the excavation of the arched corridor will allow visitors direct access to the @entity26 hilltop palace - fortress , in the same way that @entity2 entered it two thousand years ago			1
‘ there are also plans to provide tourists with direct access to the structures on the slope , the @entity293 and the @entity294 , via the earlier monumental stairway , to the hilltop @entity297			0
