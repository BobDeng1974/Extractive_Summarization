@entity2 volunteers are being trained to deal with the aftermath of a ' marauding terrorist gun attack ' like the one which left 164 dead in the @entity17 city in 2008			1
most will be trained to treat battlefield casualties over the next four years			2
however , body armour and initial guidance has already been given to small teams of ambulance and fire crews in key areas			1

' the government has to prepare for the worst and we also need to be certain that lessons are learnt from previous terrorist attacks at home and abroad , ' the department told @entity36			2
' where specialist ambulance crews may be asked to respond to incidents involving firearms , it is necessary that they receive proper training and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment			0
' the move , which according to one military source was designed to replicate protection given to the army , was applauded by former terrorism czar @entity47 as a ' very sensible precaution '			0
worst - case scenario : a victim of a gun attack lies on a hospital bed at the @entity53 in @entity7 , @entity17 , in november 2008			1
@entity17 medics had to treat the dying and injured in perilous conditions disaster zone : a policeman stands guard after shootings at a railway station in @entity7			1
the response to the atrocities was far more like going into battle it harks back to the days of the troubles in @entity67 when bullet - proof jackets were used by ambulance staff at the height of the conflict			0
however , this is the first time the equipment has been given to medics on the mainland			0
the atrocities , which had been planned for a long time in advance , involved 10 co-ordinated bombing and shooting assaults by @entity80 on hotels and restaurants in the country 's largest city			2
@entity85 has been warning hotels , restaurants and financial companies about the possibility of copycat attacks in @entity8			0
on the front line : paramedics are afforded a reasonable amount of protection when dealing with dangerous incidents , but the government believes this should go a step further amid terror threats to @entity8			0
