by @entity0 published : 10:08 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 26 june 2013 ever bumped into a friend when you 're not looking your best or when you 're just not in the mood for a chat ? well there is now an app to help you avoid these awkward social situations			0
the @entity8 is for other people app uses location - based social networking site @entity11 to track any friends who have checked into locations nearby			1
these locations are then plotted on an ' avoidance map ' and users can make sure they keep their distance			1
the map also produces green ' safe ' areas where a user can be alone branded an ' experiment in anti-social media ' , the app calculates how far away a user must be to avoid their friends			1
@entity37 points on the map indicate the 20 most recent places that friends have visited and the time of their @entity11 ' check - in '			2
green areas denote ' optimally distanced safe zones ' around the user 's local neighbourhood to avoid any unwanted encounters			0
ironically , perhaps , for people seeking to avoid any social interaction , users of the app must be a member of @entity11 social network			0
the name of the app is taken from a line in @entity56 's ' @entity21 ' and was created by @entity57 , a student at @entity59 's @entity58			0
@entity57 says that his app is : ' partially a satire , partially a commentary on my disdain for " social media " and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with social anxiety			1
' in a promotional video that shows @entity57 navigate @entity70 with his app and explain his hatred of social media , he says : ' i had to sign up for a social media site and talk to people to get them to be my friends on that site so i could avoid them '			1
@entity59 student @entity57 ( pictured ) named the app after a line from @entity56 's ' @entity21 ' and describes it as a commentary on his disdain for social media the concept has managed to achieve the exact opposite of social network @entity11 's mission , which is to connect people so they can meet friends , find and recommend places to hang out			1
however , the antisocial app does rely on a user 's friends using @entity11 to check - in to venues , so there is still a chance that a user could meet friends who are flying under the radar			2
it is questionable as to whether the solitary user achieves social isolation as they continually have to check on their friends ' locations to ensure that their ' safe zone ' is up to date			0
@entity57 is considering adding more data from social media sites in the distant future , such as @entity105 's geo - tagged tweets and @entity107 's check - ins			2
this would enable users to have more secure safe zones and avoid unwanted meetings , according to @entity112 .			0

app uses location - based social networking site @entity11 to track friends
' avoidance map ' shows friends ' locations and ' safe zones '
app was *designed* by a @entity70 student as a commentary on his disdain for social media
