taken by geoscientist @entity7 - often from aircraft - some of the images are so dramatic they could even be mistaken for works of modern art. the beauty of the natural erosion process was captured by mr @entity7 as part of a personal project spanning four years in areas of @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21			1
patchwork : this image , captured from an aircraft by geo - scientist @entity7 , shows a scenic village near the town of @entity27 , in @entity18 surrounded by fields clouds : above the clouds near @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity19			1
mr @entity7 has used his expertise in studying rocks and land forms to show how environmental forces effect our landscapes @entity39 : winter on @entity41 in @entity32 , @entity19			1
the scientist captured the beauty of the natural erosion process as part of a four year project which took him around the world light : sunset on @entity41			1
mr @entity7 from @entity50 , @entity32 , sometimes went up in a helicopter to shoot the effects of erosion greenery : the grey outline of a dead pine tree stands out amongst a sea of green near @entity59 in @entity32			2
trees and other forms of foliage play a key role in shaping the look of many of the landscapes in the collection one photo appears to show the complex structure of a block of white marble			0
in fact the image is a close - up of sediment flow in an alpine creek in @entity27 , @entity18 , created by the movement of the river and a light breeze			2
to shoot the effects of erosion on the planet , mr @entity7 , from @entity50 , @entity32 , often used helicopters or aircraft with his brother - in - law , @entity85 , 45			1
contrast : @entity87 in the @entity88 near @entity89 in @entity32			0
the remains of trees form an island in the middle of the blue green water red layers : these intricately layered rock patterns were formed by ancient sand dunes in @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 contrasts : the vivid blues , green and browns of a @entity105 tributary near @entity31 in @entity32 are captured from above stunning : what could be mistaken for swirling cloud cover or even sea foam is actually a close - up of sediment flow in an alpine creek in @entity27 , @entity18 rugged : a tiny @entity113 village is seen perched on the edge of a valley near @entity116 , in @entity20			1
the landscape was formed by a mix of natural forces branches : a tributary of the @entity105 sends sediment rich water towards the @entity123 near @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity19 other times he even hiked up mountains overlooking the vistas he was chasing in order to capture the desired shots			2
some pictures in the collection show how other natural factors , such as trees , shape the @entity6 's landscapes			0
the impact of human activity on the look of the planet is also revealed in a stunning image of the patchwork of agricultural fields surrounding a @entity18 village near @entity27			1
deep : looking down the steep valley towards the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148			0
the floor of the valley is highlighted by a coat of lush green vegetation delicate : this image shows fluffy snow pillowed on the riverbed near @entity89 in @entity32			0
the whiteness of the snow contrasts with the crystal clear water ice and snow : flying over @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity19			2
the image , taken from a plane , shows what appear to glaciers amidst the snow - covered peaks erosion : @entity170 carved by the erosive power of water in @entity147 , @entity148			0
the foliage that has grown over the rock has mixed with the dramatic crevices slopes and caves to give this landscape a distinctive appearance patterns : meandering streams and dendritic flow patterns intersect with animal trails in the mountains of @entity27 , @entity18			0
the lack of heavy vegetation shows the landscape in stark relief mountains : coastal mountains shot from on board a helicopter near @entity89 in @entity32			0
mr @entity7 's photographs capture the drama of many of @entity6 's most inhospitable environments			0

taken by geoscientist @entity7 , *29* , they show impact of erosion and other environmental forces on planet
