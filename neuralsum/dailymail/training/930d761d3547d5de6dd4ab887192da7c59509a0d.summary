a tiny horse who suffers from a rare form of dwarfism has become an internet hit after his owner posted a video of him on @entity7			1
at just over 20 inches tall , @entity8 is a third of the size of an average horse - but what he lacks in size he makes up for in personality			1
as a result the five - month - old horse has a 500 - strong following on @entity7 and his owner , @entity18 , has written a book about him			1
' he is almost like a dog , he would rather be with me than with a herd of horses or even with his mama sometimes			0
' ' he follows me around and runs in and out of the horse trailer - if he can find something to get into , he 's going to get in to it			2
' when he 's not causing trouble around ms @entity18 's farm in the @entity50 @entity49 , @entity8 loves nothing more than a good cuddle			1
she said : ' when i 'm here i can just spend my time sitting on the ground with him and he 'll stay with me until i make him get up - he just loves attention			0
almost famous : @entity8 's antics inspired ms @entity18 to write a book about his adventures small stead : because of @entity8 's condition he is likely to develop arthritis and heart problems happy couple : ms @entity18 said : ' when i 'm here i can just spend my time sitting on the ground with him and he 'll stay with me until i make him get up - he just loves attention			1
' keeping cool : @entity8 wears a peaked cap as a fan leans in to pat his face feisty : @entity8 is said to be mischievous , ' if he can find something to get into , he 's going to get in to it ' ' a lot of the time when i come home and get out of the car , he is stood there waiting at the gate and i have to stop what i 'm doing and love him for a little while - he just ca n't resist			1
' ms @entity18 was surprised at how quickly @entity8 became an online star , with his @entity7 account getting 90 visitors within 30 days of being activated			1
she said : ' people were just falling in love with him right away			0
they all want to take him home or buy him - but of course i would never sell him			0
