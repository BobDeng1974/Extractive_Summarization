for almost a century , the pile of dusty old bones lay untouched and unappreciated in a darkened recess of a museum store			1
but now , it has emerged from the shadows after scientists realised it belonged to an undiscovered species of deadly prehistoric super-predator – the blood - biting @entity10			1
the creature , which revels in the @entity13 name of @entity14 , would have terrorised the warm @entity16 seas around the @entity18 coastline around 165million years ago			2
@entity19 : the creature resembling a hybrid dolphin and crocodile has been identified by scientists examining fossil remains discovered more than a century ago the new research makes it one of the world ’s oldest known ‘ super-predators ’ – carnivores that can feed on prey as large , or larger , than themselves			2
the toothy beast , described in the latest issue of the @entity32 , was a marine crocodile measuring up to 30ft long that looked part shark and part sinister dolphin			0
its partial skeleton , including a jawbone and teeth , has been stored by the @entity41 at the @entity42 ever since it was discovered by an amateur palaeontologist in a clay pit near @entity45 in the early twentieth century			0
its significance was overlooked for years until a team of experts led by the @entity50 examined the creature and identified it as a possible ‘ missing link ’ between a group of ancient marine crocodiles and modern - day killer whales			1
dr @entity56 , of the @entity50 ’s school of geosciences , who led the study , said : ‘ it is satisfying to be able to classify a specimen that has been unexamined for more than 100 years , and doubly so to find that this discovery improves our understanding of the evolution of marine reptiles			1
’ he said that , at the time the creature lived , much of @entity67 was covered by a shallow sea , creating a chain of differently sized islands			0
@entity14 lived in this shallow sea , along with numerous other marine reptiles , including pliosaurs , plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs			0
@entity75 : the partial skeleton of the creature had lay for almost a century at the @entity41 , in @entity42 , before scientists made the discovery dr @entity56 added : ‘ giant pliosaurs were even larger than the @entity10 , so they might have feasted on the formidable species			1
‘ as its name suggests , however , @entity10 would have been swift in the water , so it likely could have out - swam possible predators and used the swimming prowess to capture its own prey			1
’ he indicated that @entity10 most likely evolved into an even more stealthy marine predator with very large and numerous teeth and a mouth that could open extremely wide			2
dr @entity92 , palaeontology curator at @entity41 , said : ‘ little research has been done on this specimen since it was first listed in 1919			0
it is comforting to know that new species can still be found in museums as new research is carried out on old collections			0
‘ it is not just the new species that are important , but an increase in our understanding of how life evolved and the variety of life forms that existed 163million years ago in the warm @entity16 seas around what is now @entity18			0
