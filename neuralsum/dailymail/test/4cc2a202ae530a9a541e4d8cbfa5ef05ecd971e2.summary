' most visas for @entity20 require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in @entity20 migration law , ' the spokeswoman said			1
' the health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in @entity20 would likely result in significant costs on the @entity20 community			1
' the visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement			2
' ms @entity5 , a single mum and nurse in the @entity1 town of @entity7 , has lived in @entity20 with her son since 2007			1
she says it is the only place he knows , and he only knows @entity72 @entity22 has lived in @entity20 since 2007 , when she arrived in the @entity1 town of @entity7 - a single mother wanting to become a nurse , in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby			1

' coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment , ' she said			0
ms @entity5 also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country			1

' i have received so many messages from mums of children with @entity167 ; it 's very prevalent in @entity20 , ' ms @entity5 said ' as a mother of a child with @entity167 , i know it is n't a disease you have to cure , but one you have to manage			1
' @entity9 is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence			2
' the idea that he ca n't contribute because of his condition is just wrong			0
people with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things ; he just needs to be given a chance			0
' ms @entity5 is sad , not angry , that the @entity13 does not understand @entity167 , and says that her son deserves a chance due to @entity9 's autism , even minor changes to their routines troubles him , meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy			1
' @entity9 notices any change to his routine			0
even if i drive him a different route to school , he 'll notice and react with a tantrum			0
but once you calm him down he 's fine			0
' but if we 're asked to go back to the @entity27 , we 'd have to start from scratch			0
