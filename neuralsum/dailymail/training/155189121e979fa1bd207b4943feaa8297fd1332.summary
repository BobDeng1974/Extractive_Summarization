by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:41 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 9 august 2013 ad vans warning illegal immigrants to ‘ go home ’ are to be investigated by the advertising watchdog			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) has launched a probe after 60 complaints were lodged over the concerns that the ads were ‘ reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past ’			1
the @entity15 is also being investigated after claims that posters boasting of ‘ 106 arrests last week in your area ’ were misleading			1
investigation : the @entity15 's ' @entity23 ' vans are to be probed by the @entity24 after receiving 60 complaints vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘ go home , or you 'll be picked up and deported ’ toured six @entity29 boroughs last month			1
the move caused a major coalition row , with @entity36 dems @entity34 and @entity37 accusing the @entity38 of trying to stoke up a ‘ sense of fear ’			1
but the @entity15 and @entity41 insisted the scheme was ‘ working ’ and the hotline had received calls			2
migrant groups , @entity47 politicians and unions also reacted angrily to the campaign and dozens of complaints were made to the advertising watchdog			1
the @entity6 has launched now a formal investigation			2
a spokesman said : ‘ complainants have expressed concerns that the ad , in particular the phrase ' @entity57 ' , is offensive and irresponsible because it is reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past and could incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multicultural communities			1
row : @entity47 's @entity67 accused the government of ' offensive stunts ' ‘ separately , some complainants have challenged whether the claim “ 106 arrests last week in your area ” is misleading			2
‘ they 've also challenged whether it is misleading because it implies arrest is the automatic consequence of remaining in the @entity79 without permission			2
we will publish our findings in due course			2
’ however @entity38 treasury minister @entity84 staunchly defended the campaign , which could be rolled out nationwide			1
he said : ‘ it is a trial and the purpose of the trial is to see what is the result			0
‘ it is quite right that we are looking at ways to tackle illegal immigration			0
’ the @entity6 's probe is in addition to another investigation by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) into a wave of immigration checks across the country			0
the @entity96 launched the probe after it was claimed that the spot checks - conducted at transport hubs up and down the country - were being carried out by border officials purely on the basis of ethnicity			0
@entity47 ’s shadow immigration minister @entity67 said : ‘ this is another embarrassing blow to a government which continues to fail to deal with immigration			0
‘ with more people absconding at the border and fewer illegal immigrants being returned , @entity111 and @entity112 ca n't even get the basics right , stumbling from one shambles to another			0
‘ you 've got to question the government 's competence			0
we need effective action on immigration not offensive stunts			0
’ @entity126 , former chief executive of the @entity127 , said it was possible to find and remove illegal immigants and appear tough on immigration without being ' nasty '			0
but backbench @entity38 mp @entity131 said if the pilot is effective it should be rolled out across the country			1
' if this works and people voluntarily go home because of it who have been afraid to go forward before because they have been worried about getting arrested and if it does anything to tackle the evil criminal gangs that bring people here unlawfully then it 's a good thing , ' he told the @entity144 .			0
