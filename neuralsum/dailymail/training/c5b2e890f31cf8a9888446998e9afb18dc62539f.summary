@entity1 rivalries die hard between the @entity2 and the @entity3 - particularly when it comes to bagging the best spots by the pool on holiday			1
but in a twist on the stereotype , a new poll suggests that tan - thirsty brits are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than @entity2 holidaymakers			0
but , as if to restore the balance of the world , statistics show that one in 10 @entity2 think it is ok to wear socks with sandals			0
happiness is ... @entity3 are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than @entity2 holidaymakers , even though more @entity2 ( 20 per cent compared to 12 per cent of @entity3 ) @entity2 holidaymakers also spend more , drink less and travel to more exotic destinations during their precious down time , although a worrying 10 per cent still think it 's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals , even in blisteringly hot weather			1
according to the survey by comparison website @entity32 , @entity2 will spend an average of £ 1,582 on their main family holiday this year , 23 per cent more than penny - pinching @entity36 who will spend around £ 1,291			1
@entity2 holidaymakers will also be enjoying a longer break than their fellow @entity36 travelers , spending around 12 days away , compared to 10 , and they 're also more likely to squeeze in an additional short - haul trip during the year			1
and while 50 per cent more @entity2 will be hoping to travel to far - flung destinations such as @entity41 , and @entity42 in the @entity43 this year , twice as many @entity3 as @entity2 ( 32 per cent versus 14 per cent ) will be making do with a staycation			1
when it comes to drinking on holiday , however , there is no competition			0
around 25 per cent of @entity36 holidaymakers admit to drinking more while on vacation , compared to just nine per cent of our more restrained @entity2 neighbours			2
good style never takes a holiday : 10 per cent of @entity2 still think it 's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals , even in blisteringly hot weather and with diet and exercise high on the agenda at this time of year , it seems that the @entity2 enjoy healthier holidays than their @entity36 counterparts , with over a third admitting that the chance to be more active is a motivating factor when choosing a family break			2
@entity67 , travel expert from @entity32 said : ' despite the fact that @entity3 get better value for money on their holiday purchases , it ’s interesting to see that @entity2 are more adventurous in their holiday choices			0
@entity3 tend to talk about @entity2 holiday habits in jest , but instead , they could do well to take a leaf out of the book of their @entity80 cousins			2
come fly with me : @entity2 holidaymakers tend to travel further afield than their @entity36 counterparts home is where the heart is : while 50 per cent more @entity2 than @entity3 will be sunning themselves in far - flung destinations such as @entity41 , and @entity42 in the @entity43 , 32 per cent of @entity3 will enjoy a staycation ' if you ’re considering following in the footsteps of @entity2 holidaymakers , it ’s worth doing your research to find out what would suit you best			1
' you can pick one of the new @entity94 services opening up the @entity96 islands of the @entity97 - great for walking , whale watching and sunbathing			0
' or why not try an active holiday in a long - haul destination such as @entity102 with an organised ascent of @entity104 , a restful beach break in the @entity107 paradise of @entity108 or perhaps a fly drive to the @entity111 states of @entity112 or @entity113 , home to @entity115 and the film set for tv cult classic @entity117			0
