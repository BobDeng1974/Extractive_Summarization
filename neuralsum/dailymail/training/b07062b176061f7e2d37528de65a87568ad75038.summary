by @entity0 a strange morphing ‘ skin ’ , which looks like it may be alive , could one day be adorning the surface of cars to make them go faster			2
the @entity7 material , developed by scientists in @entity9 , uses the same technique that makes golf balls cut through the air faster and straighter			0
at low speeds , a golf ball ’s dimpled surface reduces its aerodynamic drag in half			1
however , at higher speeds , the effect reverses			0
the ability to change the surface of the @entity7 skin in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior this has meant that high - speed vehicles have n’t been able to use this trick to their advantage , but now a team of @entity34 researchers believes they have a solution			1
they have created @entity37 , or @entity38 - a material with a two - layer skin that changes its shape in real - time			1
the inner layer is flexible silicon , wrapped in a stiff outer layer			1
when a vacuum sucks the air out of the hollow surface , the movement of the flexible and rigid layers creates dimples in the skin			1
while a ball with a dimpled surface has half the drag of a smooth one at lower speeds , at higher speeds that advantage reverses			2
@entity34 created the ' smorph ' material to take advantage of this behaviour ( pictured ) the ability to change the surface in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior			1
this is the affect that causes smooth plums to dry into wrinkly prunes			0
to mimic that process , @entity34 made a hollow ball of soft material with a stiff skin , then extracted air from the hollow interior to make the ball shrink and its surface wrinkle			1
at a certain degree of shrinkage , the surface can produce a dimpled pattern that ’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties			2
the aerodynamic properties of dimpled balls can be a bit counterintuitive : you might expect that a ball with a smooth surface would sail through the air more easily			2
the reason for the opposite result has to do with the nature of a small layer of the air next to the surface of the ball			2
the irregular surface , it turns out , holds the airflow close to the ball ’s surface longer , delaying the separation of the boundary layer			1
this reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the main cause of drag for blunt objects			1
' numerous studies of wrinkling have been done on flat surfaces , ' says @entity117 , an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering			0
' @entity120 is known about what happens when you curve the surface			0
how does that affect the whole wrinkling process ? ' the answer , it turns out , is that at a certain degree of shrinkage , the surface can produce a pattern that ’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties			2
the irregular surface holds the airflow close to the ball ’s surface longer			1
this reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the primary cause of drag for blunt objects			1
because the surface texture can be controlled by adjusting the balls ’ interior pressure , the degree of drag reduction can be controlled at will			0
' we can generate that surface topography , or erase it , ' professor @entity117 says			0
' that reversibility is why this is pretty interesting ; you can switch the drag - reducing effect on and off , and tune it			0
' the football being used at this year ’s @entity157 , for example , uses a similar effect ; so do some track suits worn by competitive runners			0
but in other uses , the ability to alter a surface could prove useful : for example , many radar antennas are housed in spherical domes , which can collapse catastrophically in very high winds			0
a dome that could alter its surface to reduce drag when strong winds are expected might avert such failures , professor @entity117 suggests			1
the technology could one day be used on the surface of high - speed vehicles , such as this @entity175			2
researchers believe it will help reduce a vehicle 's drag another application could be the exterior of cars , where the ability to adjust the texture of panels to minimise drag at different speeds could increase fuel efficiency , he says			0
@entity190 , a professor of materials research and engineering at the @entity193 at @entity193 who was not involved in this work , says , ' it represents a delightful example of how controlled processes of mechanical buckling can be used to create three - dimensional structures with interesting aerodynamic properties			0
the type of dynamic tuning of sophisticated surface morphologies made possible by this approach would be difficult or impossible to achieve in any other way			0
' the irregular surface holds the airflow close to the ball ’s surface longer improving aerodynamics			1
the football being used at this year ’s @entity157 ( pictured ) uses a similar effect			0

@entity38 has an inner layer of flexible silicon wrapped in a stiff outer layer
when a vacuum sucks air out , the movement creates dimples in the skin
these dimples can hold the airflow closer to the ball ’s surface for longer
this reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball
@entity34 hopes it could help reduce drag for cars , *planes* and other vehicles
