elephants are often seeing travelling single file , using their trunk to hold onto another mammal ’s tail in front of them			1
but one young elephant decided to go it alone , when it walked alongside its herd and even broke their chain			2
captured at @entity14 , the video shows keepers assisting six elephants along a path – five of which walk in single file			2
the baby elephant can be seen walking alongside its herd , which travel in a single file line as the first three elephants move from the shot , the fourth – a smaller elephant – is flanked by a baby			1
it stops to dawdle as it reaches the grass and uses its trunk to pick something up off the floor before setting off again			0
finding itself in between the last two elephants as it begins walking , the young mammal ’s back gets in the way and causes the link to break			0
the baby elephant stops to dawdle and picks something up from the floor with its trunk it then rather cheekily forces its way into the line at the expense of the huge – and rather understanding – elephant behind it			1
uploading the video to @entity51 , the filmmaker wrote : ‘ we had just come out of the bear ’s exhibit at @entity14 when we saw elephants being led by zookeepers along the road , it was so amazing and unexpected			0
‘ i quickly grabbed my camera to take photos and managed to get a video of them holding each other ’s tails , i had never seen elephants hold their tails in a line before , it was quite remarkable			0
the baby elephant goes to start walking once more and manages to break the elephant chain with its back ‘ the little baby elephant was constantly stopping or running off to the frustration of the other elephants , it was hilarious to watch him being put in his place			1
