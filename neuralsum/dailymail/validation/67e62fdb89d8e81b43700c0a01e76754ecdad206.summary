a drug dealer will be paid compensation by the government for the injuries he suffered in a high speed crash , despite being found with cannabis on him to sell - after a ruling by judges at the @entity9			1
@entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , was left with long term disabilities and personality changes after the @entity15 he was in , driven by an acquaintance , crashed in 2006 near @entity17			1
@entity18 , a father of four , had to be cut free from the wreckage of the crash by firefighters and a football sized portion of cannabis - worth around £ 1,000 - was found in his jacket			1
the @entity27 had initially refused to pay @entity18 any compensation because he was caught in a criminal act , namely the sale of cannabis			1
senior judges at the @entity34 have ruled that the government must pay costs and compensation , likely to run into millions , to a man severely injured in a car crash who had cannabis			1
judges said a @entity44 law that allowed insurers to refuse paying people involved in crime compensation contravenes an @entity49 directive however senior have ruled that the @entity44 policy of refusing to compensate accident victims who have been knowingly involved in crime contravenes @entity49 directives concerning motor insurance			1
they have ordered the @entity27 to pick up the bill for the breach			0
the government must now pay around £ 180,000 of @entity18 's expected £ 250,000 costs as well as pay him compensation for his multiple injuries , a sum that is likely to run into millions because of the extent of his injuries			1
@entity18 had ' gone for a spin ' with his acquaintance , @entity68 , who lost control of the £ 80,000 @entity72 sports car at high speed after trying to overtake on a bend in november 2006			1
the car crashed into a @entity77 people carrier			0
the @entity15 then ended up in a garden and hit a tree			0
its roof and passenger door had to be cut off to remove @entity68 and @entity18 from the wreckage			0
@entity18 suffered severe head injuries and brain damage with nine weeks loss of memory , and multiple fractures and internal injuries , and a changed personality			2
a fireman found a package of cannabis hidden in @entity68 's sock and , when @entity18 was pulled out of the car , a block of 240 grams of herbal cannabis fell from his bomber jacket			1
@entity68 was jailed for 10 months at @entity98 in 2007 after admitting dangerous driving and possessing cannabis			0
mr @entity101 said : ' readers might think : there must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim			0
there is not ' however , no action was taken against @entity18			0
@entity18 attempted to sue his friend for damages for his injuries , but his claim was thrown out by judge @entity114 at @entity115 in january 2011			1
his claim against car insurers @entity118 and the @entity119 after the policy was declared void , was also thrown out because the judge ruled that the car journey was for the collection and transportation of illegal drugs for subsequent re-sale and was a joint enterprise			2
the judge also ruled that his claim should be dismissed because he was engaged at the time together with mr @entity68 in conduct ' sufficiently anti-social that public policy prevents him from pursuing a claim arising out of it			0
' @entity18 , who was a vocational tutor for students interested in mechanics , had sought a multi-million - pound award to pay for the lifetime of care he will need			1
officials claimed they were covered by the ' crime exception ' enforced by the @entity119 ( @entity140 ) bans insurance being paid to those who ' knew or ought to have known ' that a vehicle in which they are travelling is being used ' in the course or furtherance of a crime '			0
in december 2011 three appeal court judges dismissed @entity18 's appeal saying he would , or should , have known the @entity15 was being used for ' the furtherance of crime '			1
however his solicitors then launched a claim against the government for breach of the 2009 @entity156 which , in the interests of standardisation , allows no exclusions			0
it was claimed that the insurers ' exclusion clause in @entity44 law was incompatible with this @entity165 directive			1
lawyers for @entity18 claimed the breach was sufficiently serious that he was entitled to what is known as ' @entity171 ' damages			2
sitting at the @entity172 last year , mr @entity101 ruled that the crime exception conflicted with the @entity156 and the @entity174 should have ensured uniformity			2
the court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely ' scene setting ' and not the cause of the accident			0
mr @entity101 said : ' i conclude with little hesitation that the @entity174 's breach is so serious that ... it must pay compensation to mr @entity10			1
the law is clear , the @entity27 is in serious breach of it , and there must be judgment for mr @entity10 '			2
he added : ' many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against @entity196 in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise			2
' the understandable reaction might be : there must be some rule of public policy , reflecting public revulsion , which bars such a claim '			0
but he concluded : ' the short answer is that there is not '			0
at the latest hearing at the @entity9 , three senior judges unanimously rejected an appeal by the @entity174			1
@entity212 , sitting with @entity213 and sales , today ruled that mr justice @entity101 was right and dismissed the @entity174 's appeal			0
the @entity174 was refused permission to appeal further to the @entity218 and was ordered to pay a £ 138,000 in interim costs			2
that is only a first instalment on @entity18 's legal costs bills which are likely to exceed £ 250,000			2
the amount of damages now payable to @entity18 has yet to be finally assessed but , given the severity of his injuries and the extent of care and support he will need in the future , it is likely to to run well into seven figures			1
@entity235 and @entity236 had been in the people carrier at the time of the crash , with their three children			0
all suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only £ 20,000 between them .			0

@entity10 was travelling in @entity15 with his friend in november 2006
@entity247 lost control and crashed car , leaving @entity18 with disabling injuries
when *rescued* @entity18 was found with ball of cannabis to sell on him
@entity18 , who now needs care , later tried to sue the car 's *uninsured* driver
insurers refused *due* to clause excluding vehicles involved in crime
but senior judges ruled exclusion clause is in breach of @entity49 motor laws
as a result @entity196 must pay costs and compensation for the breach
@entity275 is likely to run into millions for long term care of *41* - year - old @entity18
