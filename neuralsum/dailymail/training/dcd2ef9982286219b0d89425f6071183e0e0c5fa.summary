by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 11:19 est , 5 july 2012 claims : @entity2 claimed her husband , accountant @entity3 , ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind ' sham debts ' to friends and a son from his first marriage the estranged wife of a multi-millionaire claimed today he faked bankruptcy to dodge a divorce payout as she begged a court to protect ' financially weaker spouses ' in break ups			1
@entity2 claimed her husband , accountant @entity3 , ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind ' sham debts ' to friends and a son from his first marriage			1
mr @entity3 , 56 , who denies the accusations , declared himself insolvent with debts totaling £ 2.3million , four months after his wife - who his 20 years his junior - filed for divorce in june last year			2
however , his wife ’s barrister , @entity26 , claimed all but £ 400,000 of that is owed either to his adult son from a previous marriage or to two ' friends '			0
he told the judges : ' the husband has relied in his bankruptcy on at least £ 1.9million of sham debts allegedly owed by the husband to his own son , @entity38 ( from a previous marriage ) , and two friends			1
' it is the wife ’s case that most , if not all , of what @entity38 claims to own is in fact held by him for his father , and his father can call on it whenever he wants			0
' telling the judges that mr @entity3 also claims his half of the former matrimonial home is beneficially owned by his son , mr @entity26 said			2
' this is a case of a true pater familias who owns all the family wealth no matter in whose name it is held			0
' in the absence of the sham debts , the husband would not have been balance sheet bankrupt because he would have remaining assets of at least £ 1.6million			2
venue : the hearing , at the @entity62 , followed an appeal by mr @entity65 against a judges order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be heard before a divorce judge , rather than a specialist commercial judge ' the husband had made a thinly veiled threat that he would make himself bankrupt and that , in doing so , he knew exactly what he was doing			1
' the husband and his creditors are , on the wife ’s case , perpetrating a fraud against her , an innocent third party in the bankruptcy ... none of that is surprising but neither is it fair or just , ' the barrister added			0
the hearing followed an appeal by mr @entity65 against a judge ’s order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be heard before a divorce judge , rather than a specialist commercial judge in the @entity92			1
asking for the issue to be decided by a family judge , mr @entity26 said the i'nquisitorial ' nature of the divorce courts would subject mr @entity3 ’s financial dealings to deeper ' scrutiny '			0
lord @entity99 allowed the husband ’s appeal at the end of a half - day hearing , with reasons to be given at a later date			0
mrs @entity2 ’s bid to have her husband ’s bankruptcy annulled will now be heard by a @entity110 judge , separately from her financial claim in the divorce courts			1
both hearings are expected to go ahead later this year .			0

@entity2 begged judges to protect ' financially weaker spouses ' in divorce *battles*
she claimed her husband , accountant @entity3 , hid his money behind ' sham debts ' to friends and a son
case will now be heard by a specialist bankruptcy judge rather than a divorce judge
