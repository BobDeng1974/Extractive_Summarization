@entity35 police have been combing scrubland 300 yards away from the villa where three - year - old @entity38 disappeared in 2007			1
the area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine			2
it was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen walking in the direction of the site on the night that @entity38 was last seen alive			1
more equipment : as evening approached , detectives brought in more equipment to examine the area search : @entity7 detectives will reportedly search sewers this afternoon as the team continue to use radar equipment ( pictured ) to explore the coastal scrubland of @entity30 in @entity23 's @entity61 region examining the scene : @entity35 police officers discuss how best to progress earlier today aerial surveillance : a drone is employed to help examine the site from the sky the scrubland is one of three separate locations which will form part of the extensive search operation			1
on tuesday sniffer dogs led their police handlers to a pit concealed by bushes			0
the shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was covered with wooden planks , a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of earth			1
the thick surrounding overgrowth was cleared with chainsaws and mowers before spades were used to raise the cover , which is thought to have been in place for years			0
officers could be seen removing evidence in a wheelbarrow before carrying several closed bags away for further tests			0
area : the force has identified 41 areas of work in the region seven years after @entity38 disappeared police continue to dig and patrol with dogs in a bid to find clues connected to @entity38 's disappearance search : the advanced radar detection equipment has been flown in to scour the plot of land map : the search site is 300 metres from the apartment at the @entity22 resort in @entity30 and the tapas bar her parents were dining at and close to where a suspect was seen with a girl in his arms on the night she was abducted in may 2007 a local source said : ‘ the discovery of the hole came as a surprise			1
police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay things			0
’ elsewhere on the site , sewers are being analysed by @entity35 detectives using micro cameras and fibreoptic cables			1
@entity136 and @entity137 ( pictured speaking to press shortly after @entity38 's disappearance ) are bracing themselves for ' significant news ' but are not in @entity23 , reports claim the complex system of unused piping was installed as part of failed plans to build a hotel on the land before @entity38 disappeared			1

the seven - year - old @entity159 springer spaniels – @entity160 and @entity161 – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time			0
in the past they have uncovered bodies more than 20 years after they disappeared			0
and a @entity35 company whose experts have in the past worked to identify bodies after the 9/11 and 7/7 terrorist attacks has sent some of their forensic archaeologists and anthropologists to @entity23 to help with the case			0
the work is due to run at least until the weekend , and last night local sources said that @entity7 has applied for a seven - day extension to the dig. the search comes after @entity182 ordered a reinvestigation of the @entity38 case in 2011			2
