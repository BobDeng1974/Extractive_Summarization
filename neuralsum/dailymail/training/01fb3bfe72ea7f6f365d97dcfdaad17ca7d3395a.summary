the meteor fireball exploded over the @entity8 in february causing a shock wave that smashed windows , damaged buildings and injured 1,600 people			2
a 600kg rock , believed to be one of the largest pieces of this meteorite , is currently being exhibited at the @entity16 in the @entity17			1
the chunk was recovered from the bottom of @entity23 , some 60km west of @entity3			1
the meteorite exploded over @entity25 in february 2013 the chunk was recovered from the bottom of @entity23 , some 60km west of @entity3 , following a recovery operation last week			1
the meteorite broke up into multiple pieces as it entered the atmosphere , scattering space debris and creating a shock wave estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity32 atomic bombs			0
live footage on @entity4 tv showed a team pull out a 1.5 - metre - long ( five - foot - long ) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special casing while it was still underwater			1
a meteor fireball , pictured , crashed into @entity4 in february , it was part of a 656 - feet wide asteroid called 2011 @entity44			1
@entity46 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the @entity51 asteroid that regularly crosses passed earth as it orbits the sun @entity3 , 900 miles east of @entity54 and close to the @entity56 border , took the brunt of the impact a meteor that blazed across southern @entity8 in february was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			2
more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity32 atomic bombs , as it landed near the city of @entity3			0
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity68 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			1
much of the meteor landed in a local lake called @entity71			0
other than the latest find , scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from @entity23 since the february 15 incident			1
however , only five of them turned out being real meteorites			0
the rock broke up into at least three large pieces as scientists began lifting it from the ground with the help of levers and ropes			2
the scale itself broke the moment it hit the 570 - kilogramme ( 1,255 - pound ) mark			0
‘ the rock had a fracture when we found it , ’ one unnamed scientists told the lifenews.ru website in a live transmission			2
‘ it weighed 570 kilogrammes before the pieces fell off			0
and then the scale broke , ’ said the scientist			0
‘ we think the whole thing weighs more than 600 kilogrammes , ’ he said			0
the @entity101 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from @entity23 since the february 15 incident			1
the station cautioned that only four or five them turned out being real meteorites			0
last week , scientists recovered what could be giant chunk of the @entity3 meteor from the bottom of the lake it crashed into in the @entity8 , @entity4 the meteor fireball that crashed into @entity4 in february was part of a 656 - foot wide asteroid called 2011 @entity44			1
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity68 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			1
six fragments of the meteorite have already been handed over to @entity122 in @entity123			0
in august , @entity125 satellites made the unprecedented measurements of the meteor which is thought to have released 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed @entity32			0
@entity46 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the @entity4 town of @entity3 , where the meteor landed , and claim it came from the large @entity51 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity68 as it orbits the sun. they added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitational pull of the planets and the sun , or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit			2
satellite data from @entity125 has revealed that that four days after the bolide explosion , the faster , higher portion of the plume ( red ) had snaked its way entirely around the northern hemisphere and back to @entity3 in @entity4			0

the chunk was recovered from the bottom of @entity23 last week
it is now on display at the @entity163
