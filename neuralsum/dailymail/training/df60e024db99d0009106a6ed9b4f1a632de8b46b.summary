the @entity6 says @entity1 expressed ' strong condemnation ' of @entity5 ' attacks on @entity3 and again supported @entity3 's right to defend herself but implored @entity2 to abide by a permanent ceasefire between his country and the terrorist group			1
@entity1 's call with the the world leader followed @entity3 's rejection on friday of a new ceasefire agreement with @entity5 negotiated by @entity19 secretary of state @entity18			1
afterward , an @entity3 news report quoted ' voices ' from the latter leader 's cabinet describing @entity18 as ' completely capitulating ' to @entity5 and ' negligent , ' and a top @entity3 journalist compared @entity18 to a space alien - characterizations that had the @entity1 administration ' fuming ' on monday , according to the @entity27			1
he went on to say @entity18 would be ' responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled ' if his actions resulted in an escalation of @entity3 military aggression			2
' @entity18 is n’t anti-israeli ; on the contrary , he ’s a true friend to @entity3 , ' @entity34 wrote			2
' but his conduct in recent days over the @entity41 cease - fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events			0
' it ’s as if he is n’t the foreign minister of the world ’s most powerful nation , but an alien , who just disembarked his spaceship in the @entity61			0
' fighting resumed between @entity3 and @entity5 on sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary ceasefire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day			1
appearing on @entity68 's @entity67 on sunday morning , @entity2 reaffirmed his country 's refusal of @entity5 ' ultimatum and chastised his enemies ' violation of previously agreed upon ceasefires			1
' @entity3 is doing what any country would do , and certainly what the @entity19 would do , ' @entity2 said			1
the @entity6 says @entity1 called the @entity3 @entity78 that afternoon and told him ' ultimately ' a long - term solution ' must ensure the disarmament of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of @entity41			1

' as of sunday , more than a thousand @entity87 had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured , according to @entity27 nearly four dozen @entity3 soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed			0
in excerpts of an interview with @entity5 leader @entity99 that aired on @entity100 on sunday and monday , @entity96 told @entity101 that ' the world has two choices ' - to help @entity5 ' peacefully ' remove @entity3 from the @entity104 and the @entity41 or ' we will expel this occupation from our land			1
' ' we are not fanatics			0
we do not , actually , fight the @entity112 because they are @entity112 per se - we fight the occupiers , ' he said			0
@entity5 will keep fighting the ' occupiers , ' he said , until it is victorious			2
' i can die because of @entity3			0
i can not live under the occupation			0
the occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine , ' he said			0
' so every single @entity87 can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom			0
' @entity99 danced around whether @entity5 would ' coexist with the state of @entity3 ' if @entity126 had its own state before telling @entity128 , ' when we have a @entity87 state , then the @entity87 state will decide on its policies , ' adding that the ' @entity87 people can have their say , when they have their own state , without occupation			1
' @entity138 secretary general @entity137 said today that both @entity2 and @entity99 were ' morally wrong ' for allowing the death and destruction to continue and the two men need to show ' compassionate leadership ' by ending the armed conflict			2
he joined @entity1 and the @entity144 in calling for ' an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease - fire , ' saying that ' @entity41 is in critical condition			1
' @entity137 also said @entity3 's retaliation against @entity5 raises ' serious questions about proportionality			2
' his statement follows a @entity152 resolution last week approving an international investigation into @entity3 for potential war crimes in @entity41			0
@entity19 senator @entity155 , a @entity156 , said on sunday that he would ' condemn ' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on @entity3			2
' the @entity152 report is a joke , ' @entity155 said in comments reported by @entity163			0
' the @entity138 is becoming anti-israeli , anti-semitic			0
' will they ever forgive him ? : one @entity3 journalist compared @entity18 to a space alien after he failed to successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire between @entity3 and @entity5 last week throughout @entity3 it was secretary @entity18 who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary			1
@entity174 columnist @entity173 called @entity18 ' an ongoing embarrassment , with the characteristics of a snowball			0
' ' the further he rolls , the greater the embarrassment , ' @entity173 said			0
@entity3 tv reporter @entity178 ran a report citing government officials who framed @entity18 as ' incapable of handling the most basic matters			2
' the @entity27 said monday that @entity1 administration officials said on background that by ridiculing @entity18 , @entity3 ministers ' crossed a line ' and relations between @entity3 and the @entity19 may never be as close as it once was as a result			1
in on the record comments deputy national security adviser @entity188 came to @entity18 's defense			0
' @entity3 has no better friend , no stronger defender than @entity18 , ' he told @entity27 the comments about @entity18 are ' people leaking things that are either misinformed , or attempting to misinform , ' he claimed .			2
