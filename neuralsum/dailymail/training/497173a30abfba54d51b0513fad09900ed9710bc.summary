as much as 44billion tons of nitrogen and 850billion tons of carbon could be released into the environment as permafrost thaws over the next century , @entity1 government experts warn			2
the release of carbon and nitrogen in permafrost could make global warming much worse and threaten delicate water systems on land and offshore , according to scientists from the @entity13			2
it comes after the @entity15 last week warned of record levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			1
a glacier on @entity21 , @entity22 : melting permafrosts such as these threaten to release billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , accelerating climate change , a new study has warned billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere are likely to be trapped for centuries with far - reaching impacts for all life , it was warned			1
but the latest figure suggests levels of carbon could double in 100 years , meaning that the increase in global temperatures will be likely to accelerate			1
the previously unpublished nitrogen figure is useful for scientists making predictions with computer climate models , the researchers say , while the carbon estimate adds credence to other studies with similar findings			2
' this study quantifies the impact on @entity52 's two most important chemical cycles , carbon and nitrogen , from thawing of permafrost under future climate warming scenarios , ' said @entity13 director @entity56			0
he does n't look too worried : @entity58 of the @entity59 holds permafrost sample from about 2m depth , the likes of which @entity13 analysed ' while the permafrost of the polar latitudes may seem distant and disconnected from the daily activities of most of us , its potential to alter the planet ’s habitability when destabilised is very real			0
' to generate the estimates , scientists studied how permafrost - affected soils , known as @entity74 , thaw under various climate scenarios , reporting their findings in the journal @entity78			0
they found that all @entity74 are not alike			0
some have soil materials that are very peaty , with lots of decaying organic matter that burns easily – these will impart newly thawed nitrogen into the ecosystem and atmosphere			1
other @entity74 have materials that are very nutrient rich – these will release a lot of nitrogen into ecosystems			0
however , all @entity74 will contribute carbon dioxide and likely some methane into the atmosphere as a result of decomposition once the permafrost thaws – and these gases will contribute to global warming			1
@entity22 's extreme northern territories have been devoid of forests for millions of years			0
but the forests could be about to return , thanks to changing global temperatures , according to research at the @entity101 , which suggests the freezing temperatures may mellow just enough to see the return of the ancient forests which once surrounded this icy area			0
@entity106 , of the @entity101 's @entity107 , presenting his findings at the @entity109 in @entity110 , said : ' according to the data model , climate conditions on @entity21 will be able to support the kinds of trees we find in the fossilised forest that currently exist there , such as willow , pine and spruce			0
' i 've also found evidence of a possible growth of oak and hickory near the study site during this period			0
' although it would of course take time for a whole forest to regrow , the findings show that our grandchildren should be able to plant a tree and watch it grow			0
' ' the scientific community researching this phenomena has made these international data available for the upcoming @entity139 , ' said study lead @entity140 , @entity13 research soil scientist			0
' as permafrost receives more attention , we are sharing our data and our insights to guide those models as they portray how the land , atmosphere , and ocean interact			1
' last week the @entity15 's @entity151 reported that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had reached 390.9 parts per million ( ppm )			1
that constitured a 40 per cent increase on the 280ppm in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution began			1
other greenhouse gases are also on the rise and are contributing to the warming caused when the trap heat that would otherwise escape into space			1
methane levels rose to 1831 parts per billion which are 159 per cent higher than in pre-industrial times while nitrous oxide rose to 324.2ppb , about 20 per cent up on historical levels			1
the increases mean that about 30 per cent more heat was trapped in the earth ’s atmosphere last year than it was in 1990			2
rising carbon dioxide levels are considered to be having the most serious impact on global warming and is calculated to be responsible for 85 per cent of the extra trapped heat .			2

comes after @entity15 *agency* last week warned greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had reached record levels
