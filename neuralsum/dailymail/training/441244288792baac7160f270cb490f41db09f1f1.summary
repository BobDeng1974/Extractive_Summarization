by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:54 est , 26 february 2014 these birds , butterflies , beasts and bugs are among hundreds of species which have become extinct in @entity9 over the last 200 years			1
wildlife experts have today launched the largest ever online portal of information about the incredible 421 species which have disappeared from our country since 1814			1
the @entity16 , which is behind the @entity17 , hopes that by publicising this issue they can help prevent a further loss of biodiversity			1
they once roamed the forests and grasslands of @entity32 , but are now extinct in @entity9 , @entity33 and @entity34 and numbers in @entity25 are critically low with less than 100 remaining ' it ’s so easy to think of species extinction as something that happened decades ago in @entity9 , but year upon year we continue to lose species , at a rate which is far higher than would occur naturally , ' said @entity42 , director of the trust			1
' sometimes the list of extinct species names can seem rather dry and scientific so this project aimed to find as many pictures as still existed of these species , to give a fitting testament to the role they played in lighting up our countryside , and highlighting the tragedy that these lights have now gone out			0
' the red - backed shrike became extinct in 1988 due to habitat loss , agricultural intensification and egg collecting			0
these birds , butterflies , beasts and bugs are among hundreds of species which have become extinct in @entity9 over the last 200 years the black - backed meadow ant became extinct in 1988 due to urban development and inappropriate land management the world is currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction event , with species disappearing as a result of habitat loss , intensification of agriculture and pollution , as well as other human activities			1
@entity9 ’s lost species include ants , bees , beetles , butterflies , dragonflies , fish , fleas , fungi , mammals , moths , shrimps , spiders and wasps			1
the plant @entity95 ’s @entity94 was once found at a site in @entity97 , but in the 19th century it was drained for development and has never again been seen in this country			0
@entity101 ’s @entity100 , which was only ever found in @entity9 , has become globally extinct following changes in water quality as its one known site			2
the @entity105 atriplicis or orache moth became extinct in 1905 due to the drainage of fens			0
the @entity16 aims to remove 50 species from the edge of extinction in the @entity112 by 2050 through effective conservation strategies			1
the @entity114 or pig 's ear fungus became extinct in 1927 due to habitat loss and degradation in @entity121 times the large tortoiseshell butterfly was widespread in southern @entity9 , but it became extinct in 1953 due to @entity123 elm disease , which eradicated the main larval food source			2
the black - backed meadow ant became extinct in 1988 due to urban development and inappropriate land management			0
the great auk ( left ) was a flightless bird which grew up to 85cm tall and became globally extinct in the mid- 19th century			0
the dainty damselfly ( right ) , which has a blue body , was once found in @entity132 but severe flooding in 1953 destroyed its breeding sites in @entity121 times the large tortoiseshell butterfly was common in woods in the south of @entity9			2
but the beautiful insect has since suffered a severe decline and is now extinct in the @entity140			0
causes of decline include climate change and @entity123 elm disease which eradicated its main larval food source			0
it is now found in mainland @entity32 , northern @entity146 and western @entity147 the @entity16 has now launched an online database with information and images of @entity9 ’s lost species			1
' if we continue to allow these extinctions to occur , this country will soon be bereft of the biodiversity that remains , ' added @entity42			0
' we hope the website will raise awareness and knowledge about conservation issues in this country , and inspire people to become more involved in protecting their local biodiversity			0
@entity162 became extinct in 1968 due to human disturbance , inappropriate use of burning for land management , the natural succession of heathland vegetation and high grazing levels the great yellow bumblebee ( left ) was once found across @entity170 , but habitat loss and agricultural intensification have caused its range to contract , and it became extinct in @entity9 in 1981			2
@entity174 ( right ) , a type of beetle , became extinct in 1925 due to a decline of juniper , its host @entity180 became extinct in 1882 due to changes in land management			0
the @entity16 , which is behind the @entity17 , hopes that by publicising this issue they can help prevent a further loss of biodiversity the @entity187 rosacea ( left ) became extinct in 1960 due to overgrazing and pollution			1
@entity190 became extinct in 1928 ' one of the primary aims of the @entity16 is to prevent this list from getting any longer			2
' we believe that by both raising awareness about the tragic extinctions that have already occurred and focusing our work on the very rarest species in the @entity112 , we can prevent further losses from occurring			2
' the @entity16 aims to remove 50 species from the edge of extinction in the @entity112 by 2050 through effective conservation strategies .			1
