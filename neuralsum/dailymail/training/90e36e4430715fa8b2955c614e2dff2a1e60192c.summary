by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 14 may 2013 shrouded in secrecy : translators working on @entity4 's new novel @entity5 were banned from discussing the plot and made to work in an underground bunker to keep the text a mystery it is a scene that could have come out of one of @entity4 's own novels - 11 people confined inside an underground bunker keeping a closely - guarded secret from the rest of the world			1
however , instead of a mystery to be solved by @entity4 's hero @entity19 , this was the reality for translators toiling over the @entity23 author 's latest tome			0
such was the publisher 's desire to release @entity4 's new novel @entity28 in several languages on the same day , the translators are said to have found themselves cooped up in a high - security basement working seven days a week until at least 8pm			1
the @entity32 translation of @entity28 is ' hell ' , and it would be hard to imagine a more devilish existence then that of the linguists , who were tasked with reading the new novel day and night			1
the chosen 11 were banned from taking mobile phones into the windowless bunker at the @entity40 headquarters of @entity42 publishing house , @entity41			1
their laptops were nailed down to their workstations and the translators , from @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity42 , were only permitted to access the internet via a solitary supervised shared computer , according to newspaper @entity53 on sunday			1
security surrounding the project was so tight that although the translators were allowed to eat their meals at the @entity41 staff canteen , each was given a cover story to conceal what they were really up to between february and april 2012			2
when not in use the prized manuscripts were stored in safes , guarded as tightly as the valuable artworks depicted in @entity4 's popular mystery thrillers			0
the plot of @entity28 has been shrouded in secrecy , but is believed to make repeated references to @entity28 , the first part of epic poem @entity71 , which depicts the narrator 's journey through hell			1
publishers were so scared that the translators might pirate the text before the publication date each of the 11 was banned from discussing the plot , forced to sign in and out each time they entered the bunker and to keep a record of all their activities , including cigarette and meal breaks			2
going globall : the new novel by @entity4 , above , being released on may 14 in @entity32 , @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity48 , @entity89 , @entity42 and @entity91 versions @entity42 translator @entity92 told magazine @entity93 , which is also published by @entity97 family - owned @entity41 , that there was initially ' distrust ' among the group , although by the end of the ordeal the bunker had a ' playground atmosphere '			1
a @entity47 translator , @entity105 added that the experience had enabled the linguists to immerse themselves completely in the text			0
foreign versions of @entity32 language books have usually been published after the originals , causing publishers to lose money			0
the blog , love @entity49 books , has stated that @entity4 's last novel , @entity116 , had already climbed to number two on the country 's bestseller list by the time the @entity49 version was released - one month after the @entity32 edition hit the shelves			0
inferno will instead be published on may 14 , and released in @entity32 , @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity48 , @entity89 , @entity42 and @entity91 versions on the same day			2
big screen hero : @entity126 , right , has played @entity4 's hero @entity19 , in the film version of novels the @entity23 , which also starred @entity130 , left it is the fourth of @entity4 's books to feature symbology expert @entity19 , who was portrayed by actor @entity126 in the film versions of previous novels , @entity23 and @entity136			0
according to the description of the novel on @entity139 , @entity28 is ' set in the heart of @entity141 , where @entity19 is drawn into a harrowing world centred around one of history 's most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces			2
' he has said of the new book : ' although i studied @entity28 as a student , it was n't until recently , while researching in @entity151 , that i came to appreciate the enduring influence of @entity154 's work on the modern world			2
' with this new novel , i am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm , a landscape of codes , symbols , and more than a few secret passageways			0
' the 48 - year - old 's books have previously been translated into 52 languages and as of last year had sold more than 200 million copies combined , while the @entity126 films have taken around Â£ 800 million			0
