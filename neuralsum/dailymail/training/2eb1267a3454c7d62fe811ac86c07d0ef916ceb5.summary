@entity0 has given the clearest indication yet that he will quit international football following his @entity4 snub at the hands of @entity7 coach @entity6			1
@entity0 was left out of the squad this summer because @entity6 claimed that he did not play as well for his country as he does for @entity10			1
the player ’s @entity13 girlfriend @entity11 responded on @entity15 saying : ‘ f * * * france and f * * * deschamps ! what a s * * * manager ! ’ it was the latest international disappointment for @entity0 who was left out of @entity7 ’s 2010 @entity4 squad and then banned for three - games for verbally abusing a reporter at @entity26			1
‘ yes , i ’ve made the decision , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i took it a while ago but i ’ll say it when the time is right			2
it ’s not something you can just announce on @entity15			2
‘ i did n’t win anything with the national team so it ’s more easy to take this decision than if we ’d just won something			2
when you play for a big club and you play lots of games , it ’s easy to come to this decision			1
‘ maybe during the international breaks i can stay and work a little bit more			2
all the players who played the @entity4 and have lots of games during the season with their national teams can get tired and pick up injuries , that kind of stuff			1
so i think i will be fresh			0
‘ even before the summer , during @entity26 i had a lot going on			0
personally it does n’t affect me but it affects my family			0
they live in @entity7 , they read the press and stuff like that			1
by your side : @entity0 's girlfriend stuck up for him when the midfielder was left out of the @entity7 squad ‘ i live in @entity73			1
i ’m fine with everything they said and i ’m used to it			0
but for my parents it ’s really hard			0
i want to make them happy and the national team does n’t make me happy			2
’ asked if he would rather have been at the @entity4 in @entity81 this summer than having a rest after helping @entity10 to win a @entity84 and @entity85 double last season , @entity0 replied : ‘ no , i ’m quite happy with my holidays			1
‘ it ’s always good to have a long summer break but you have to find a good balance – too long is not good			0
when i came back i suffered a little injury but i ’m quite fresh and i just need more games to be ready for the start of the new season			0
‘ i ’m excited about the new season			0
the @entity84 will be really hard because every team has bought quality players			0
so it ’s really exciting and we are looking forward to the start of the season			0
’ last eight : @entity7 reached the @entity4 quarter - finals without @entity0 before they were beaten by @entity101 not a fan : @entity6 claimed @entity0 plays better for @entity10 than he does for @entity7			1

@entity0 will make an *announcement* soon about his international *future*
