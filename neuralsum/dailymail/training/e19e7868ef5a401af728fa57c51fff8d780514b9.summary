by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 11:16 est , 2 january 2014 a new test that can establish whether smokers are lying about their habit has been developed			0
the saliva test can show whether a person has smoked within the last three days			2
the test could be used by doctors who are trying to help their patients give up the habit , as well as by health insurance companies working out their premiums			0
a test which can tell if a person has smoked a cigarette has been developed by the @entity16 the @entity18 test was created by researchers at the @entity16			1
it requires the person taking the test to spit into a cup and the person conducting the test can then dip the test into the saliva			1
it works by detecting cotinine in saliva – this is a breakdown product of nicotine			1
it can not establish how many cigarettes a person has smoked , as people smoke different types of cigarettes and in different ways			2
however , it shows how much nicotine a person has consumed in the last three days			0
as a result , the test will be positive if a person is using nicotine replacement products , even if they have completely stopped smoking			1
the test requires a person to spit into a pot and their saliva is then tested for a breakdown product of nicotine while this could lead to a false positive result for cigarette use , it could also help people establish how much nicotine they need to take to enable them to quit			1
the test gives a positive or negative result within one minute , but takes six minutes to provide a clear picture of a person ’s nicotine consumption			1
it can pick up passive smoking but the reading would be so insignificant the colour change on the test would not be detectable with the human eye			0
the results show whether a person has consumed nicotine within the last three days - it can also picked up passive smoking but the colour change would be so small the human eye could not detect it dr @entity78 , honorary senior research fellow at the @entity16 , said : ‘ smoking is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases , such as respiratory diseases , cardiovascular disease and diabetes			0
‘ it also causes blood pressure to rise and is linked with high cholesterol levels			0
’ the @entity18 test is now being used as part of the @entity90 free @entity89 programme to verify non-smoking in their policy holders , so they can qualify for relevant incentives			2
it is also available to any other people or organisations that want to use it .			0

the @entity18 test requires people to spit into a cup so their saliva can be tested for a breakdown product of nicotine , *called* cotinine
it ca *n't* tell how many cigarettes a person smoked but shows level of nicotine consumption - test will be positive if they use nicotine replacement
it gives a positive or negative result within a minute - takes five or six minutes for an *accurate* reading of the level of nicotine consumption
