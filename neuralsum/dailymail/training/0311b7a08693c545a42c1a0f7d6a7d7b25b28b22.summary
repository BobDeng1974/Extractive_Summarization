@entity1 's bid to regain his world title ended in failure after a thrilling toe - to - toe clash with @entity5 in @entity6			1
the @entity8 bantamweight displayed his trademark grit and determination in the principality but was eventually undone by the @entity13 's class			1
and at just 24 , the @entity15 des etoiles crowd may have witnessed the unearthing of a new star in @entity18 as he won on all three scorecards			1
@entity1 's ( right ) bid to regain his world title ended in defeat against @entity5 ( left ) @entity1 falls to the floor during the @entity23 world champsionship fight at the @entity15 des etoiles @entity1 , 10 years his opponent 's senior , won the @entity26 title four days before last @entity27 with a battling performance against @entity29 in @entity30			1
his first defence , against @entity32 , was a non-event after @entity32 was cut in the second round and the fight ruled a technical draw			0
@entity1 , who spent his youth in @entity38 before turning his life around , was aggrieved when @entity40 was awarded a split - decision victory in @entity42 in june			2
but the new champion immediately vacated to return to super-featherweight , leaving the title vacant			0
@entity18 , backed by the powerful @entity47 promotional outfit and with an impressive amateur pedigree , had won his first 21 fights as a professional with 12 of his last 13 opponents bringing winning records to the table			1
and the first round set the tone for the rest of the fight as neither man let up during a fast and furious opening three minutes			0
but it was the @entity60 who stamped his authority in the second session , flooring @entity1 with a straight left			2
he recovered well , however , and the pair spent the remainder of the round head to head like rival stags			0
after another three minutes that could have been fought out in a cupboard under the stairs , @entity18 took a step back in the fourth stanza , found his range and punctured @entity1 's defence			1
@entity1 showed a flicker of recovery in the 10th session but was unable to land a knockout blow on @entity18 the @entity81 then let his frustrations get the better of him in the fifth , slamming his right hand into @entity18 's groin , leaving him writhing around on the canvas in pain			1
but @entity1 had his best spell of the fight as it reached the halfway point , a spell of pressure late in the session enough to halt his slide			0
neither man was showing signs of tiring and although the smaller of the two , @entity18 was more than matching @entity1 in the strength department			1
and the longer the fight went on , the more his quality began to tell			0
boxing at range , he let his hands go before slipping off , leaving @entity1 grasping at thin air			0
even when he was dragged into a dog fight , @entity18 more than held his own			0
@entity1 showed a flicker of a recovery in the 10th session but he quickly returned to the back foot and must surely have realised by now that he needed a knockout to regain his title			2
not that @entity18 's winning position meant he took his foot off the pedal in the last round , however , as both men served up a finale worthy of the fight 's opulent setting			2
the judges are all in agreement after the final bell with scores of 116 - 11 twice and 118 - 110 .			0
