by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 4 november 2013 a four - year - old girl is battling a disease that means her tiny bones could shatter at the slightest knock			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , @entity7 , suffers from @entity9 ' cell histiocytosis , which affects just one in 200,000 children			1
@entity5 was diagnosed after she broke her arm in a minor fall and now doctors are hoping to be able to cure her with chemotherapy			1
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity15 ) suffers from @entity9 ' cell histiocytosis a rare cancer - like condition which affects just one in 200,000 children in the @entity21			1
she was diagnosed after breaking her arm her mother , @entity15 , said : ' it was a typical fall , but when i thought about what happened it just did n’t add up			1
@entity5 fell on soft grass so the impact should n’t have broken her arm			1
' at first , consultants feared @entity5 had cancer			1
her mother , a biomedical scientist at a @entity33 hospital , recalled the moment she was ushered into a room by doctors			0
she said : ' they asked me to come into this room and i kept thinking it was n’t right			0
' they thought @entity5 might have cancer and over the next few days we lived at the hospital as they did loads of tests			1
' what followed was an anxious wait as @entity5 went through a series of mri scans and biopsies only for consultants to realise she did not have cancer after all			1
the condition has left @entity5 with very brittle bones meaning her mother has to keep a constant eye on her in case she knocks herself and breaks a bone but her mother 's relief was short - lived as doctors soon broke the news that @entity63 was instead suffering from @entity9 ' cell histiocytosis			1
the condition develops when the body has too many @entity68 ' cells - these normally develop to protect the skin but when there are too many present they can move around the body causing damage			1
the disease can affect the bones and organs and can cause a range of symptoms from loss of appetite to bone pain and a rash			2
the condition has a high survival rate and can be treated with chemotherapy as the chemotherapy drugs help to destroy the excess @entity9 ' cells			1
@entity5 ( pictured with her aunt @entity86 , left , and mother @entity15 , right ) is now having chemotherapy in an attempt to destroy the excess @entity9 ' cells which are damaging her bones when doctors examined @entity5 they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body , including in the back of her skull			1
her family is now praying her chemotherapy treatment is successful specialists believe @entity5 may have been born with the condition - leaving her little body a ticking time bomb and doctors amazed an accident did not happened sooner			1
ms @entity5 said : ' breaking her arm was a blessing in disguise			1
' we would have been none the wiser and she could have done far more serious damage because her bones are being eaten away			2
' @entity109 is not technically a cancer , but it behaves like a cancer and it can be treated with chemotherapy			2
it is named after dr @entity9 who first described the cells in the skin from which the disease develops			0
@entity9 ' cells are normally only found in the skin and major airways			0
in people with @entity109 , the cells are abnormal and are found in other parts of the body including the bone marrow , lungs , liver , spleen and lymph glands			2
when they are present in these tissues they can cause damage			0
@entity109 is divided into two groups - single - system @entity109 which just affects one part of the body , such as the bones , and multi-system @entity109 which affects more than one part of the body			1
about 50 children in the @entity21 develop @entity109 every year - it is more common in boys than girls			0
symptoms include poor appetite , irritability , bone pain , a rash , hearing problems , breathing difficulties and jaundice			0
single - system @entity109 may disappear on its own without treatment			0
multi-system @entity109 is usually treated with chemotherapy as it can help destroy the @entity109 cells			1
80 to 90 per cent of children with @entity109 make a full recovery			0
source : @entity156 when doctors examined @entity5 they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body , including in the back of her skull			1
her mother must now constantly watch over her as she could suffer a break from the slightest knock			0
she can no longer join in with playtime games and is also prone to infection			0
@entity5 is undergoing an 18 month course of chemotherapy and has a tube fitted in her chest to administer a drug cocktail doctors have devised to fight the disease			2
she would have had regular biopsies but these were halted when doctors grew concerned @entity5 ’s bones may fracture as they tried to take tissue samples			2
@entity5 's aunt , @entity86 , 39 , always attends her chemotherapy sessions			2
she said : ' @entity180 scares @entity5 so much and fighting the fear is a massive thing			0
' @entity5 has her own unique way of getting through the sessions - with a little help from her favourite pop star @entity186			2
@entity86 said : ' @entity5 can be a bit of a diva and she loves @entity186 , so on the way to the hospital we always sing " diamond " and by the end @entity5 is saying " i can do this "			0
' but there is no knowing whether the chemotherapy will work and the steroids she is prescribed have changed @entity5 ’s personality			2
@entity86 said : ' they give her terrible mood swings			0
we laugh about it and call her a little monster , but it ’s been hard for her school friends who ’ve had to quickly learn about her condition			0
' @entity86 , a mental health nurse , has thrown all her efforts into fundraising for @entity209			0
she said : ' it ’s just my way of getting through things			0
@entity15 was , and still is , in a state of shock but she raised over £ 3,000 when she skydived in september			0
' @entity5 is due to start her next round of chemotherapy this month			2
her family is praying the treatment will work and , for now , are trying to keep life as normal as possible .			0
