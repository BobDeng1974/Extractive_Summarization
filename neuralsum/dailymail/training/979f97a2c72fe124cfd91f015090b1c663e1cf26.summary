@entity0 , says @entity1 , could be wiped out by asteroids – and we ’re not taking the threat seriously @entity1 is n’t a man to mince his words			1
he famously described the belief that the world is 6,000 - years - old as ‘ b * * * * * ks ’ and those who think the planet would end because of the @entity13 calendar as ‘ morons			1
’ but , lately , something far more serious has been weighing on the mind of the @entity18 physicist			2
@entity0 , he says , is at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we ’re not taking the threat seriously			1
‘ there is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us , ’ professor @entity1 told @entity24			1
in fact , the @entity29 had a ‘ near - miss ’ only a few months ago			1
‘ we did n’t see it , ’ says the 46 - year - old			1
‘ we saw it on the way out , but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out			2
’ the bus - sized asteroid , named 2014 @entity41 , came within 38,300 ( 61,637km ) miles of @entity29 in march - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet			1
and it was n’t the only one threatening @entity29			0
@entity48 is currently tracking 1,400 ' potentially hazardous asteroids ' and predicting their future approaches and impact probabilities			2
the threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity53 has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact			1
the threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity53 has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			1
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity1 tells @entity24			1
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it			2
’ for instance , earlier this year @entity72 researchers revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching @entity29 with nuclear weapons			1
the @entity78 team outlined their vision at a @entity48 conference , and say they would need just a weeks ’ notice to launch if the system were developed			2
but ideas such as this are n’t progressing fast enough , says @entity1			1
‘ i think its human stupidity we need to worry about			1
no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			0
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity1 tells @entity24			1
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it ’ dramatic proof that any of these can strike @entity29 came on 15 february last year , when an unknown object exploded high above @entity97 , @entity98 , with 20 – 30 times the energy of the @entity100 atomic ‘ it ’s the way we behave , but also just the way we do n’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could			1
’ ‘ we just do n’t			2
i mean , you can see it by the figures			0
we spend virtually as much on it as everyone else , which is sod all			0
’ last year , global spending on government space programs dropped for the first time in almost two decades			2
the @entity114 now spends nearly £ 300 million ( $ 500 million ) on civil space programmes , while the @entity72 , invests $ 38.7 billion ( £ 23.3 billion ) on its space budget			0
professor @entity1 says this is not nearly enough			1
highlighting something known as the @entity120 equation , he said the time is ticking for humanity			0
the equation was thought up by dr @entity120 to bound the terms involved in estimating the number of technological civilisations that may exist in our galaxy			0
although @entity48 is monitoring the skies , no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			0
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity1 tells @entity24			1
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about that ’ in it , he claimed that the time it would take for a technological civilisation to self - destruct would be around 200 years			1
‘ that might not be a bad estimate , actually , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ if you think about it , we almost did it with the @entity147			0
‘ we may almost be doing it again			0
it ’s not clear , the way we ’re dealing with the environment			0
‘ but we ’ve been close to wiping ourselves out , only a few hundred years after we became a technological civilisation			0
’ and it ’s not just asteroids we should worry about , climate change and artificial intelligence are also key concerns			1
the only way to deal with it is to spend more money on research and education , to improve our , he says			2
professor @entity1 is currently working to inspire the next generation of scientists with his involvement in science summer school in @entity167 ( @entity168 ) in @entity169 , @entity170			1
he says our best hope of mitigating threats such as these is to actively pursue more knowledge , bridge the skills gap in science and engineering and increase our spending on research			2
it ’s not just asteroids we should worry about , climate change and artificial intelligence are also at the top of the astrophysicist 's list			1
' conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with , ' said @entity1			2
' look at humans ’ ‘ i mean , you are talking about the far future			2
and things you say about the far future often sound fantastical			0
but [ the threat of artificial intelligence ] is a legitimate question			0
‘ if you think the brain is basically a computing device , but a very complicated one , then presumably it operates according to the known laws of physics and therefore you should be able to simulate them			0
‘ what do you do ? it ’s an ethical dilemma			0
conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with – look at humans			0
’ his views echo that of @entity206 - founder , @entity205 , who earlier this year said that the threat of artificial intelligence is more severe than nuclear weapons			1
‘ ultimately i would say , it ’s about not being so myopic			0
we know quite a lot about nature , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ let ’s say we ’re the only civilisation in the @entity216 , which is possible			0
‘ if you were to sit there from that perspective , to say , how would we rearrange our affairs to protect ourselves because we are the only intelligent civilisation in the galaxy , it would n’t be like this … right ? ’ the date of @entity29 's potential destruction has been set at 16 march 2880 , when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet			1
researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart , but somehow remains intact on its @entity29 - bound trajectory			0
they believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as @entity239 - and although this is considered a major breakthrough , scientists still do n't know how to stop it			0
the discovery was made by researchers at the @entity246 ( @entity246 ) , @entity247			0
previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction			2
the asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles ( 15km ) a second relative to the @entity29			0
it is due to swing so close to @entity29 it could slam into the @entity258 at 38,000 miles per hour			0
it is estimated that if 1950 @entity261 were to collide with the planet , it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of @entity264			0
although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent , this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids .			0

professor @entity1 says we recently had a ‘ near - miss ’ with a large asteroid
no one knows when next one could be . it ' could be tomorrow , ' says @entity1
engineers are working to mitigate threat , but progress has been slow
as well as asteroids , threats to humanity *include* @entity285 and climate change
‘ it 's human stupidity we need to worry about , ' claims professor @entity1
he says threats can be prevented through research and education
