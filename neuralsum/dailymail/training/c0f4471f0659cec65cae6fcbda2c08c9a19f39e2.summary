shocking evidence shows four in 10 people returning to their jobs after treatment have been unfairly treated - a 50 per cent rise in three years			1
patients are being denied time off for medical appointments , passed over for promotion or feeling abused by their employer or colleagues			1
despite the recent introduction of the @entity22 which should protect workers with cancer , some felt so harassed they quit their jobs , claims the charity @entity25			1
it commissioned a @entity27 of @entity29 adults who returned to work after cancer treatment which found around one in 10 could not continue in their job as a result of discrimination			1
one in eight said their employer failed to make reasonable changes to enable them to do their job			2
the survey of 168 adults found 37 per cent of people returning to work after cancer treatment experienced some kind of discrimination from their employer or colleagues			1
this figure jumped from 23 per cent in 2010			0
the poor practices included hassle over time off for treatment , failing to be considered for promotion and being given unfair workloads by bosses or work colleagues			1
over 100,000 people of working age are diagnosed with cancer each year in the @entity29 almost half of those who are working when diagnosed with cancer have to make changes to their working lives after cancer , with around four in ten changing jobs or leaving work altogether			0
@entity25 said employers must reform their attitudes as an ageing workforce means growing numbers will be diagnosed before retirement			0
chief executive @entity70 said ' employers are risking prosecution by flouting their legal responsibility to protect people living with cancer from unfair treatment and stigma at work			1
unfair : one in eight said their employer failed to make reasonable changes to enable them to do their job ( file picture ) ' there needs to be far more understanding of cancer and how the effects of treatment may impact on people returning to work			2
going back to work after treatment can be very isolating especially if someone has been off for a while and has lost confidence or contact with colleagues			2
' as our population grows and ages , and the retirement age rises , cancer will become an increasingly common issue for employees and their managers			0
' it 's vital they are equipped to help people with cancer stay in work			0
it is n't difficult and it is likely to be cheaper and easier than recruiting a replacement or defending a discrimination claim			2
' @entity113 , 46 , from @entity114 , was diagnosed with a blood cancer in 2010 , said ' when i told my employer that i 'd been diagnosed with cancer and asked to have some time off for treatment , i was given the sack			1
the poor practices included hassle over time off for treatment , failing to be considered for promotion and being given unfair workloads by bosses or work colleagues ( file picture ) ' they said they could n't employ someone who was not a hundred per cent committed			1
it was a shock as i had a very successful career , and a fulfilling life			0
' i took them to an employment tribunal through a solicitor			0
but it was costing so much i had no money left to fight for my legal rights			0
' i was paid a financial settlement			0
it was n't a lot , and it 's gone just trying to keep the bills paid			0
it 's been a most soul destroying experience and i have never felt more alone than now , trying to regain my place in society with a new job			0
' @entity25 is calling for employers to fulfil their obligations to people returning to work after cancer treatment under the @entity22			1
these could include making reasonable changes to their work environment or hours and ensuring they have a back to work plan			0
the charity is also calling on the government to address the lack of specialist back - to - work services for cancer patients in the @entity29 such as counselling , physiotherapy and occupational therapy .			2
