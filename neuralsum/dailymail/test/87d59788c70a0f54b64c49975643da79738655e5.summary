the @entity0 , the oldest knockout football competition in the world , is set to be rebranded as the @entity3 in a new £ 30million sponsorship deal in a move that will upset traditionalists , the @entity0 are understood to have secured a three - year contract with @entity8			1
the deal , due to be rubber - stamped by the @entity0 board on thursday , is believed to be worth at least £ 10million a year — but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144 - year - old competition			1
@entity14 won last season 's @entity0 competition , which will be rebranded the @entity3 @entity17 will face the holders @entity14 in this season 's final at @entity21 renaming it the @entity3 is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous ‘ in association with @entity27 ’ agreement , which was worth £ 9m annually			1
but the @entity0 , after a highly embarrassing season without any @entity3 backer that has put huge pressure on their commercial department , needed to offer more to attract a significant sponsor to the table			2
the hunt proved hugely difficult even after the @entity0 revamped their sponsorship team to bring in expertise honed at @entity38			0
and it needed a bit of luck to attract @entity8 , who have a massive sports sponsorship portfolio across the world that includes @entity14 ’s stadium and kit			0
emirates have big money to spend after deciding last november not to renew their £ 30m - a - year @entity49 sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 @entity50 with the corruption allegations surrounding those tournaments said to be a consideration			1
and @entity8 are no longer involved , either , in the tender for a @entity56 airline sponsor , allowing the @entity0 to offer a major football sponsorship alternative			2
@entity58 - based @entity8 have their arch @entity60 airline rivals @entity61 as @entity63 ’s kit and stadium sponsors			0
but @entity63 foresee no problems with an @entity3			0
@entity17 beat @entity66 in their semi-final to deny @entity68 ( centre ) the chance of a final trophy the new @entity0 deal with @entity8 will also allow for a further six subsidiary sponsors for the competition , with @entity27 , @entity75 and @entity76 already signed up			0
and the ambition is for the whole @entity0 sponsorship portfolio to be worth £ 20m by 2018			1
the @entity8 deal , likely to be officially announced nearer to the @entity0 final on may 30 , is also well - timed for the @entity0 ’s commercial department with the new chief executive @entity82 arriving at @entity21 next month .			0

@entity0 is set to be named @entity3 as part of sponsorship deal
it is understood @entity0 have agreed a three - year sponsorship deal with airline
