the @entity1 plane looks like the drones that fly over @entity3 - but the $ 715 million vehicle is designed to fly over @entity6 's largest moon , @entity7 , a body that has fascinated scientists because of its thick , cloudy atmosphere			1
the @entity1 probe is built to take 3d photos of the surface , to help scientists build up a picture of the planet 's geology			1
at the end of its mission , the 120kg aircraft would dive down to the surface and attempt a landing on @entity7 's dunes			0
the $ 715 million @entity1 probe is an unmanned @entity24 similar to the probes used over @entity3 - and the 120kg aircraft would be uniquely well suited to life soaring through the thick atmosphere of @entity7 the probe would be equipped with a horizon imaging camera - and would roll in flight to capture full images of cloud banks floating above the planet scientists believe that @entity7 is uniquely suited for heavier - than - air craft - the moon 's gravity is relatively low , but its atmosphere is thick , which would mean that a heavier than air craft such as @entity1 could stay airborne for longer			1
the moon is thickly shrouded in clouds , and scientists are intrigued about what lies beneath			0
unlike a balloon - the rival method proposed for missions to @entity1 would allow scientists to precisely control its altitude , and build up a library of 3d images of the surface and @entity7 's weather			2
@entity7 is bigger than our own @entity53 and even the planet @entity55			2
the temperature at @entity7 's surface is about -178 178 degrees centigrade			0
the $ 715m price tag for the mission includes the aircraft plus a rocket and lander to deposit it on the surface of @entity7 the project did not make @entity67 's most recent round of funding , but @entity69 and his colleagues maintain that a heavier than air aircraft is the most realistic method of exploring @entity7 the 120kg aircraft will be powered by a generator which creates heat from plutonium - 238			1
when it 's sending data back to earth , the aircraft will go into a glide to conserve power the @entity1 would be much nimbler than a balloon , and would use its plutonium - powered generator to stay on the ' day ' side of @entity7 to make the most of its photographing time			1
it would go into a glide to save power whenever it was sending images ' back home			0
' like earthly aircraft , it would have a ' safe mode ' where it would remain steady in @entity7 's atmosphere when necessary - ensuring it did n't come to harm if its communication link broke			0
@entity96 would be just 120kg - in @entity7 's atmosphere , it would be able to glide for long periods @entity69 , a scientist at a @entity98 designed the concept with a team of 30			2
@entity1 did not make @entity67 's last round of funding - although the $ 715m price tag includes a delivery system to get it to @entity7			1
@entity69 remains hopeful that interest in @entity1 is high , and that he can make the next round of funding			0
he is insistent that a heavier - than - air craft is the best way to explore the thick atmosphere of @entity7 - and that a balloon would not do the job .			0

plutonium - powered craft *weighs* just 120kg
moon bigger than ours - and bigger than @entity55
$ 715m project would take 3d photos of surace
