by @entity0 published : 15:54 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 15 march 2012 the @entity1 began yesterday with its most tragic day for six years			1
three horses were put down after suffering serious injuries			1
spectators and tv viewers watched in horror as the first , @entity7 – who had been the favourite to win his race – broke a hind leg at a hurdle			2
the horse ’s distress was witnessed by millions in tv footage as he was pulled up			0
tragic : @entity17 , pictured here in 2009 , died after breaking a hind leg on the opening day 's racing of the @entity1			1
two other horses were also killed heartbreaking : @entity23 , 13 , right , suffered a serious injury today and had to be destroyed			1
the horse is pictured here in 2008 another runner in the same race , @entity23 , was also destroyed after sustaining a similar injury			1
officials later announced that a third horse , @entity31 , was to be put down after falling in the 2½ - mile novice chase – the final event of the day			1
the tragedies infuriated animal rights groups			2
one , @entity36 , warned that the ground was ‘ dangerously firm ’ and claimed races ‘ should never have taken place ’			1
of the event that claimed the lives of @entity42 and @entity23 – the seven - furlong cross-country handicap chase – a spokesman for the group said : ‘ rather than take the precautionary step of calling off the race , officials risked the lives of the horses , and two paid the ultimate price			1
’ the claims were vigorously denied by race organisers last night			1
they said the course and its obstacles had been inspected several times to ensure that it was safe			0
‘ it was watered and it was deemed perfectly fine to race on by the course inspector , ’ a @entity61 spokesman said			2
the deaths are sure to reignite debate over whether horse - racing is an unnecessarily cruel sport			0
before yesterday ’s deaths , nine horses had been killed at the @entity1 between 2007 and 2011			2
in 2006 , 11 horses were killed , including six on one day			2
three of those came after the novice chase			0
critics say the @entity1 puts horses under enormous pressure due to its big , noisy crowds and frenetic atmosphere			2
fury : animal welfare groups have reacted angrily following the deaths of the three horses on the first day 's racing at the @entity1 they also warn that many of the races feature too many horses , making it difficult for the animals to judge their jumps			1
however , race organisers say they take horse safety ‘ very seriously ’ – and that campaign groups such as @entity36 are not welfare organisations , but ‘ extremists ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity61 said : ‘ like most competitive sports , racing carries risks			0
no one wants to see valuable and valued racehorses killed and injured			0
‘ it is regrettable that three horses suffered accidents where the injury was not treatable and so euthanasia was the proper and humane option			0
‘ racecourses , horse - racing trainers and the sport ’s regulator are not complacent about these risks , and recognise there is still more to do , including both on - going improvements and scientific research , to further reduce these risks			0
’ @entity36 said they planned to hold a protest at @entity1 today to remind racegoers of ‘ the heavy price paid by horses ’ at the event			0
a spokesman for the group said : ‘ more horses have been killed at @entity125 than at any other in the country over the past five years – a little - known statistic that the owners of the course will not be keen to share with the paying punters			1
’ the @entity1 is not the only racing event to have come under scrutiny in recent years			0
five horses were killed at last year ’s @entity136 meeting – the highest death toll since 1997			0
the @entity138 was criticised for ‘ barely mentioning ’ the deaths , ‘ concealing ’ the grim reality of horse - racing and presenting a ‘ dishonest , sanitised picture ’ of the sport to boost overseas sales of the footage			0
at the time , the @entity146 denied taking part in any ‘ cover - up ’ and said its presenters always gave an update on the condition of horses injured in a race .			1

@entity17 , @entity23 and @entity31 all died on the course which has claimed the lives of nine horses in five years
animal aid claims the race in which two of the horses died should never have taken place because the ground was too firm
