by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor more than one in six of @entity5 ’s most troubled families have been released from a ‘ cycle of despair ’ , the government claims			1
some 22,000 of the so - called ‘ @entity9 ’ families have been turned around , with children back in school , crime cut and thousands of parents back in work			1
it follows ministers demanding an end to the ‘ it ’s not my fault ’ culture which allowed up to 120,000 problem families to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives			2
families , like those headed by @entity25 in the tv show @entity9 , cost the country £ 9billion - a - year @entity28 launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in @entity32 and other cities in @entity5			1

ministers set a target of helping 120,000 families by 2015			0
at the £ 448 million scheme 's half - way stage the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) today said town halls were working with 62,000 families to reduce youth crime and truancy or help get jobless adults back to work			1
more than 22,000 families have been classed as turned around : with children back in school , levels of youth crime and anti-social behaviour significantly reduced and over 1,400 adults in continuous work			1
community secretary @entity66 said the ' no nonsense ' approach of the scheme was working the statistics also showed that 92,000 families have now been identified by councils as meeting the criteria for the payment - by - results programme			2
@entity75 has already turned more than half of its 930 troubled families around and @entity80 almost half of its 810 , the @entity51 said			1
communities secretary @entity66 said : ‘ i am delighted that our programme is already helping half of our target of 120,000 troubled families at its mid way stage			2
‘ councils are making great strides in a very short space of time , dealing with families that have often had problems and created serious issues in their communities for generations			0
‘ these results show that these problems can be dealt with through a no nonsense and common sense approach , bringing down costs to the taxpayer at the same time			0
’ under government criteria , a troubled family is one that meets five out of seven criteria : having a low income , no one in the family who is working , poor housing , parents who have no qualifications , where the mother has a mental health problem , one parent has a long - standing illness or disability , and where the family is unable to afford basics , including food and clothes			2
many of the seven are beyond the control of the families themselves			0
head of the troubled families programme @entity130 said : ‘ this programme is getting to grips with families who for too long have been allowed to be caught up in a cycle of despair			2

’ @entity28 launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in @entity32 and other @entity5 cities sir @entity148 , chairman of the @entity149 , said : ‘ improving lives goes to the heart of what councils do , and the troubled families programme has built on the excellent work councils were already doing to better co-ordinate support across the public sector for families who need it			1
‘ the progress being made by local authorities vindicates @entity163 's decision to put councils at the centre of this programme and demonstrates the huge difference councils can make in this area when given the necessary powers and adequate resources			0
‘ focusing money on tackling root causes of problems rather than treating symptoms provides a better deal for the public purse and for the people we are trying to support , and is vital if we are to make public services sustainable in the long - term			0
‘ the success of the @entity183 programme should serve as a lesson to the rest of government in the savings and improvements to public services that can be achieved by adopting a community budget approach to delivering other local services			0
