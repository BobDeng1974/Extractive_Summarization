but the @entity6 looks set to ruffle @entity8 feathers with its latest commission			2
the gallery has awarded coveted hanging space to an artist whose back catalogue includes this raunchy painting of a pregnant @entity15			1
@entity16 , 25 , was crowned @entity17 and his work will be hung at the @entity6 his previous work includes this imagined portrait of a pregnant @entity15 wearing a leopard print bra , done partially in spray paint @entity16 , 25 , was crowned winner of the @entity25 competition last night			1

mr @entity16 won with an oil painting of @entity36 war veteran @entity35 @entity34 , who won the @entity37 in 2005 after saving fellow soldiers from two ambushes			1
the competition ’s judges – including @entity6 director @entity42 - described the work as ‘ magnificent , bold and accomplished ’ and it will hang in the gallery for a week			1
but it is his earlier works that are likely to raise eyebrows			0
earlier this year , the former graffiti artist from @entity49 – who used to make a living painting model trains for his father ’s business – completed a rather less flattering portrait of the @entity15			1
he won for this portrait of @entity37 winner @entity55 which the judges called ' magnificent ' mr @entity16 with the @entity37 winner			1

as part of his prize , mr @entity16 has been awarded a £ 10,000 commission to paint double - booker prize winning author @entity76			1

but speaking ahead of the final @entity25 episode he did shed some light on his unconventional artistic background			0
he said : ‘ i like to listen to hip hop on my headphones while i ’m working			0
the music helps me to focus and it goes hand in hand with the whole underground culture of graffiti art. mr @entity16 said listening to hip hop as he works helps him to ' focus and it goes hand in hand with the whole underground of graffiti art ' ‘ i started out learning to do graffiti writing when i was a teenager			1

he added : ‘ i generally paint my subjects from photos rather than from life			0
i like to capture them in moments that reveal their personalities rather than in formal poses			0
‘ it is a dream come true to have one of my paintings in the @entity6			0
it is the perfect start to my career			0
’ mr @entity16 – who has a degree in fine art - has now started work on his portrait of mrs @entity76 , best known for her historical novel @entity129			1
