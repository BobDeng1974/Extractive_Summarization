a subterranean cycle and walking network using @entity3 's abandoned @entity2 is being proposed			1
the @entity4 would be lined with kinetic paving , which uses friction from cycle tyres and shoes to generate electricity to power the project			1
although the plan may look unlikely it won the @entity13 at the @entity14 last night , presented to designer @entity15 by mayor @entity16			1
the route could run under central @entity3 from @entity18 in the east to @entity20 in the west with docking stations for the capital 's ' @entity24 ' scheme dotted along the tunnels			1
@entity46 , co-director of @entity47 , says ' now that @entity3 has reached the highest level of population in its history we need to think creatively about how to maximize the potential of our infrastructure			0
' the adaptation of surplus and underutilized tube and rail tunnels could provide a quick and simple addition to our infrastructure network			0
' @entity15 designers also believe that there could be room for a network of shops and businesses and even space for an underground park			0
tunnels would not be the only spaces used , with former telephone exchanges , stations even and reservoir chambers part of the plans			0
new use : the empty tunnels and other spaces could be used for businesses , events and even public art to generate money connectivity : the focus would be on a main tunnel running from @entity18 in the east to @entity20 in the @entity86			1
the route would also be linked to existing and new bridges architect @entity89 said : ' @entity15 's proposal brings back an ignored part of the city through the collective efforts of its citizens			2
by harnessing the kinetic energy of every one 's footsteps , a whole new urban space is unlocked underneath the city			0
' this self - sustaining approach to urban infrastructure is key to a carbon - neutral community , and @entity3 could lead the world once again in merging tradition with innovation to create a better future			2
' @entity108 would also offer new sites for pop - up businesses , exhibitions , retail and event space to generate money .			0

the @entity4 may look unlikely but it has won a prestigious design award given by @entity16
@entity118 could run under central @entity3 from @entity18 to @entity20 - linked to new and existing bridges
paths for cyclists and walkers lined with kinetic paving - using friction from tyres and shoes to generate energy
