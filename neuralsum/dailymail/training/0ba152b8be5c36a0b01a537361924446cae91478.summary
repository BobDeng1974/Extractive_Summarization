by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 10:31 est , 16 january 2014 @entity2 offered our men platform heels and string vests , while @entity7 pushed woolly pants , fur gilets and ' manty - hose ' ( that 's tights for men , by the way )			0
if we thought @entity14 would be any kinder , we were wrong			0
on day one of the @entity19 fashion week , @entity17 designer @entity16 presented an eclectic collection seemingly inspired by ladies hats , circus @entity22 , tapestry , sportswear , eccentric @entity27 folklore and an ironic take on the @entity30 headdress			1
@entity32 - style headgear with fastened @entity34 straps topped off tailored jackets and tight , bright leggings , finished with high - top trainers			2
mismatched stripes and clashing colours and fabrics featured heavily			0
a cloche - style hat with @entity34 strap tops off striped , @entity22 ensemble for @entity45 ( l ) and in another colourway ( r ) many headpieces and hats featured spray painted feathers with silly and serious messages on the first day of @entity14 men 's fashion week @entity16 's message for @entity55 / 14 was clear : stop racism			1
the message was spray - painted in red across the largest , oversized headdress of the collection - a white feathered @entity30 - inspired piece shaped into what could be perceived as a middle finger			1
it could be a dig at @entity66 designer @entity65 , whose pre-fall 2014 collection featured models wearing @entity30 - inspired headdresses in @entity70 last month			1
is @entity16 having a dig at @entity65 ? designer caused controversy for pre-fall 2014 @entity66 range featuring @entity30 - inspired headdresses @entity16 appears immortalised on an applique jumper - complete with fringing beard @entity16 accepts praise at the end of his eccentric show yesterday feminine touches like baby pink and ruffles peeked beneath the loud and proud two - pieces painted faces intercepted big beards , crop circle haircuts and bouffants political posturing aside , @entity16 's sense of humour and style shone through			1
in @entity93 - style outlandishness the desginer flaunted feminine touches like baby pink and ruffles , peeking from beneath colour - clashing two - pieces and fuzzy outerwear			0
his portrait was even immortalised on an @entity101 © jumper complete with fringed facial hair			0
once he had shown his collection the designer , 57 , came out to take a bow , looking as eccentric as his collection with his full bushy beard , orange top and high - top trainers			2
a model 's painted face blends into his bomber jacket - inspired cartoonish top - topped off with sheepskin jacket an aerial view of the collection in full , reminiscent of tapestry , sports , the circus and kitsch @entity27 folklore meanwhile , @entity122 designer @entity121 for @entity125 's men 's @entity45 collection also turned heads in @entity14			1
scrunched - up shirts covered in multicoloured paint splashes and iridescent foil quilted jackets were just some of then outlandish designs presented from the avant - garde fashion house			2
some models even appeared to silently mock each other 's outfits - even though they were wearing exactly the same			0
paint explosions and iridescent foil quilted jackets graced the catwalk at @entity121 for @entity125 men 's @entity45 @entity122 designer @entity121 for @entity125 's men 's @entity45 collection in @entity14 today			0
