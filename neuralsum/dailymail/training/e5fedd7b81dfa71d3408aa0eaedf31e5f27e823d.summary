thirty - five years after the genocidal rule of @entity3 's @entity2 ended , a un-backed tribunal on thursday sentenced two top leaders of the former regime to life in prison for ' extermination , inhumane acts and attacks against human dignity '			1
the regime 's 1970s terror period left close to two million people dead			1
the historic verdicts were announced against @entity16 , the regime 's 83 - year - old former head of state , and @entity19 , its 88 - year - old chief ideologue - the only two surviving leaders of the regime left to stand trial			1
@entity54 said both men were guilty of ' extermination encompassing murder , political persecution , and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer , enforced disappearances and attacks against human dignity			1
' there was no visible reaction from either of the accused , both of whom have denied wrongdoing			2
the rulings can be appealed , but @entity54 told the court that ' given the gravity of the crimes ' both would remain in detention			2
the case , covering the forced exodus of millions of people from @entity3 's towns and cities and a mass killing , is just part of the @entity87 story			1
nearly a quarter of the population — about 1.7 million people — died under rule of the @entity2 through a combination of starvation , medical neglect , overwork and execution when the group held power in 1975 - 79			2
tribunal spokesman @entity98 called it ' a historic day for both the @entity87 people and the court			2
a young @entity87 woman looks at the main stupa in @entity104 , which is filled with thousands of skulls of those killed during the @entity108 regime a tourist looks at human skulls of genocide victims at the @entity112 , formerly the most notorious @entity2 prison , in @entity42 former @entity2 leader @entity108 talks to a journalist in a hide - out in @entity3 - he died in 1998 the @entity2 , the communist ruling party in @entity3 between 1975 and 1979 , was responsible for the deaths of almost two million people , through executions , torture and starvation			1
its leader , @entity108 , was determined for society to be transformed into classless agricultural communism – at any cost			2
city dwellers were marched into the countryside to become farmers in labour camps , with those refusing to move shot dead and their homes burned to the ground			2
factories , schools , banks and even hospitals were shut down and the population denied medicine			0
many died through starvation – after all , most people from cities had no idea how to fend for themselves in the countryside and farmers were often too terrified to help them adapt			0
some died through exhaustion , because the regime severely overworked those tending the land			1
many were tortured and executed for being ‘ enemies of the regime ’			1
anyone with links to the former @entity87 government , filmmakers , writers and indeed anyone deemed to be intellectual deserved to be put to death in the eyes of @entity159 even simply owning a pair of glasses could prove fatal , because as far as the regime was concerned , it meant that books were being read instead of hard labour being carried out			1
religion was outlawed , so @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 were also executed in huge numbers			0
the victims have waited 35 years for legal accountability , and now that the tribunal has rendered a judgment , it is a clear milestone			0
' many have criticized the slow justice , however , and its cost			0
the tribunal , formally known as the @entity179 in the @entity180 and comprising of @entity87 and international jurists , began operations in 2006			0
it has since spent more than $ 200million , yet it had convicted only one defendant — prison director @entity185 , who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011			0
the current trial began in 2011 with four senior @entity2 leaders ; only two remain			1
former foreign minister @entity190 died in 2013 , while his wife , @entity192 minister @entity191 , was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia in 2012			1
the group 's top leader , @entity108 , died in 1998			1
@entity16 has acknowledged that mass killings took place			1
but testifying before the court in 2011 , he claimed he was just a figurehead who had no real authority			0
he denied ordering any executions himself , calling the allegations a ' fairy tale			0
' instead , he blamed @entity108 for its extreme policies			0
@entity19 , who is known as brother no. 2 for being @entity108 's trusted deputy , had also denied responsibility , testifying in 2011 that @entity212 forces — not the @entity2 — had killed @entity87 en masse			1
' i do n't want them to believe the @entity2 are bad people , are criminals , ' he said of those observing to the trial			1
' nothing is true about that			0
' because of the advanced age and poor health of the defendants , the case against them was divided into separate smaller trials in an effort to render justice before they die			0
both men now face a second trial that is due to start in september or october , this time on charges of genocide , @entity230 said			1
that trial is expected to take years to complete			2
survivors of the regime traveled from across the country to witness the historic day , filling several hundred seats available to the public at the tribunal			2
after the verdict was read , many said they felt mixed reactions and questioned if any punishment could fit the crimes committed by the @entity2			0
' the crimes are huge , and just sentencing them to life in jail is not fair , ' said 54 - year - old @entity251 , who spent years in hard labor camps building dams and working in rice fields			0
his brother was killed during the @entity2 era ' but what can i do ? i just accept the verdict , ' he said , but then added : ' even if they die many times over , it would not be enough			0
' a female survivor , 58 - year - old @entity265 , said she felt a sense of relief that justice was finally served , even if it was generations late			0
' i have been waiting for this day for many years , ' said the woman , whose husband and several other family members were killed during the @entity2 reign			0
' now , for the first time , my mind feels at least some degree of peace			0

@entity16 was the regime 's former head of state , @entity19 its chief ideologue
@entity297 said they were guilty of ' extermination encompassing murder '
both men , in their 80s , now face a second trial on charges of genocide
