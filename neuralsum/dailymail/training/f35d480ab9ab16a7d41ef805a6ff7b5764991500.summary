by @entity0 last updated at 3:42 am on 30th january 2012 they were the underground military bases where @entity2 and the @entity3 prepared for what might have been during the @entity5			1
now the @entity6 , a 265,000 square foot complex encompassing nuclear bunkers used in the @entity5 , can be seen by a wider public audience after they were unveiled during a rare open day			1
the bunkers near @entity12 , @entity13 , were constructed during @entity14 originally for use by @entity16 under the @entity18 ’s @entity17			2
eerie : the now empty tunnels were formerly occupied by @entity2 , military officials and the @entity3 until the @entity5 ended in the early 1990s hideout : the tunnels were originally built for machine workshops in @entity14 , but became strategy bunkers as tensions grew in the @entity5 war rooms : the kitchen of the canteen in the tunnels , which underwent a £ 1m renovation in the late 1980s code named @entity31 , the tunnels were originally built to @entity16 could use them to produce aero engines and components			1
although mainly used for machine workshops and storage , the secretive facility was given a second lease of life during the @entity5 when officials took it over fearing a nuclear attack			0
new rooms , equipment , water and other utilities were installed inside the tunnels as it became a base for the @entity47			0
working ladies toilets were another feature of the @entity5 bunker shown to the 60 visitors during the @entity52 water works : a hot water dispenser in the bunker still has the same shine it did several decades ago preserved : a trust of local people in @entity13 helped save the bunker from redevelopment after it was sold in 1993 during the @entity5 itself , mps , army officials , the @entity3 and local police were among those who would use the underground complex to run exercises in case @entity66 was attacked			2
in the late 1980s the government extensively renovated the bunkers at a cost of around £ 1,000,000 , but as the @entity5 ended in the early 1990s the site was eventually sold off			1
once the site was privately sold , plans emerged to turn it into a residential and commercial park			0
however , the facility was saved after residents formed the @entity77 and helped fight its redevelopment .			0

@entity6 were constructed in @entity14 but became @entity5 hideouts
military complex was almost *demolished* after @entity5
site covers 265,000 square feet and had £ 1m renovation in 80s
