by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 is now less popular with voters than the @entity6 party , a new poll shows for the first time			1
there has been a ‘ noticeable shift ’ against the prime minister in recent months , according to polling by former conservative donor @entity10			1
the @entity6 party has also been damaged by recent rows over gay marriage and @entity15 , with only one in four voters now believing mr @entity3 ’s party is united			1
popularity : voters are now feel more favourable towards the @entity21 than @entity3 personally , reversing a long - term trend that saw the prime minister outpoll his party months of @entity6 in - fighting has hit the party ’s reputation with voters while also tarnishing mr @entity3 ’s own standing			1
strategists had argued that the prime minister was more popular with the public than the conservative party as a whole			1
it was seen as a key rebuttal to those in the @entity6 party who calling for a change in direction or even a change in leader			1
but the polling shows that 22 per cent of those questioned said they were more favourably disposed towards the @entity6 as a whole while only 18 per cent were more positive about mr @entity3			1
lord @entity10 said it was the first time this had happened in his polling			1
he blamed the @entity6 setbacks on the party putting people off by ‘ talking amongst ourselves ’ about peripheral issues like @entity15 and gay marriage rather than focusing on voters ' core priorities			1
he issued a warning to the party 's leadership that there was ‘ no time to waste ’ , and said it was vital for chancellor @entity62 's spending review later this month to show that @entity21 are doing what the public want from them			0
in particular the @entity21 have lost ground on key issues like crime , immigration , welfare reform and the economy over the early months of this year			0
overall , 37 per cent of those questioned said they would vote @entity73 , 27 per cent conservative , 15 per cent the @entity76 @entity75 and 9 per cent @entity77			2
switch : voters are now more favourable towards the @entity6 party generally than @entity3 , polling by @entity10 shows although the @entity73 received the best reaction words : pollsters asked were asked which words they most associated with the three party leaders here it gives @entity88 's party a comfortable 10 - point lead , but lord @entity10 noted that this was ‘ not much of a score for an opposition party expecting to sweep to power in 23 months ' time ’			1
mr @entity88 was hugely out - polled by the @entity73 , by 38 per cent to just 10 per cent			0
a majority still said they would prefer to have mr @entity3 than mr @entity88 in @entity96 , and the prime minister and @entity62 retained their lead over mr @entity88 and shadow chancellor @entity99 as the best team to manage the economy			1
a @entity73 candidate in a key target seat has criticised the party 's leadership			0
@entity106 , hoping to over-turn a 3,500 @entity6 majority in @entity108 , complained that under @entity110 in 1997 the party was able to capture ' a very broad electorate '			2
speaking at a meeting of the @entity114 think tank progress , she said the party had to do more to explain what it would do in government			0
' we ’ve got to both oppose and propose an alternative			0
' the leader of @entity121 also questioned the party 's economic strategy with shadow chancellor @entity99			2
she added : ' we ’ve let the @entity21 and others get away with blaming @entity73 for the economic crisis , and we urgently need to counter that			0
' the government 's lead over @entity73 on the economy widened by several points if deputy prime minister @entity131 was named in the question as one of a three - man team alongside mr @entity3 and mr @entity62			1
writing on the @entity137 website , lord @entity10 said : ‘ the prime minister 's @entity15 speech ( in january ) was supposed to clear the decks and allow us to talk about the things we were elected to do			1
so much for all that			0
‘ my poll shows the last six months to have been a missed opportunity to make progress on all the things that will determine who wins in 2015 ... this is the price we have paid for spending half a year talking amongst ourselves			0
’ for the @entity21 , the first half of the year was ‘ a time of stagnation that we could hardly afford ’ , said the @entity6 peer , adding : ‘ the spending review later this month makes it all the more necessary to show we are doing what people expect of us			2
there is no more time to waste			0
’ voters were asked whicvh words and phrases they associated with the three party leaders			2
mr @entity3 was branded ' out of touch ' but also a leader who ' stands up for @entity76 '			1
mr @entity88 is seen predominantly as ' weak ' and ' out of his depth ' , while mr @entity131 is ' weak ' , ' out of his depth ' , and ' out of touch '			0
the poll found that only 28 per cent of voters see the conservatives as ‘ united ’ , against 48 per cent for @entity73			0
some 38 per cent trusted mr @entity3 and mr @entity62 to manage the economy , compared with 33 per cent for @entity88 and @entity99			2
but 40 per cent trusted mr @entity3 , mr @entity62 and mr @entity131 with the economy , against 26 per cent for the @entity73 team , suggesting that @entity77 influence on the coalition 's economic policy is welcomed by voters			2
of those questioned , 24 per cent said they were satisfied with the job mr @entity3 is doing as @entity139 , and a further 33 per cent say they are dissatisfied but would prefer to have him in @entity96 than mr @entity88			0
only 30 per cent would rather see the @entity181 in @entity182			0
some 40 per cent said they expect a @entity73 government after the next election , while 29 per cent forecast a @entity6 government , 13 per cent another @entity6 - @entity77 coalition and 18 per cent a @entity73 - @entity77 pact			2
