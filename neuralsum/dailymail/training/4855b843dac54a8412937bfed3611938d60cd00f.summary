savers could soon be able to switch current accounts within five days instead of seven			1
last year ministers cut the time limit from 30 days to a week			1
more than 1.2million people , frustrated with rock - bottom interest rates , switched banks as a result			0
now the chancellor may reduce the time limit to five days in his @entity10 next wednesday , according to @entity11			1
chancellor @entity12 , pictured , is believed to be considering reducing the length of time it takes to swap a bank account from seven days to just five in a bid to encourage competition for savers the @entity20 could also extend its ‘ switching guarantee ’ to small businesses with a turnover of up to £ 6.5million			1
the guarantee is currently restricted to firms taking less than £ 2million			0
a lower time limit is aimed at increasing competition between banks and building societies , in the hope that they will increase interest rates to attract customers			2
rates on instant - access current accounts have been at a record low since july , and show no signs of improving			2
the average is now just 0.42 per cent , below the @entity40 ’s base rate of 0.5 per cent			0
one of the biggest beneficiaries of seven - day switching has been @entity43			0
however , last night its chief executive @entity44 said : ‘ my personal view is [ reducing the time limit ] will not make much difference			1
i do n’t think customers will be any more likely to switch if it takes five days than if it takes seven			1
’ during the first three months of the year , 22,771 savers switched to @entity43 and 11,091 left , for a ‘ net gain ’ of 11,680			2
only @entity54 and @entity55 did better , with @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 all haemorrhaging customers			0
the @entity20 and the @entity61 , which oversees the switching guarantee service , declined to comment on claims that mr @entity12 would make five days the new limit			1
@entity44 of @entity43 , pictured , said cutting two days off the time it takes to change bank accounts will not make any difference among savers			1
last year the time was slashed from 30 days to seven however , it is understood that the mooted changes have met with resistance from several banks , which say there is little evidence to suggest a lower limit would lead more customers to switch			1
@entity78 , of advice website @entity79 , said the publicity surrounding the switching service ‘ seems to have had a positive effect on the competition between key providers ’			0
however , she agreed that ‘ reducing the time taken from seven to five days seems rather pointless ’			2
the @entity87 is already reviewing the current switching service , and will examine whether banks could let customers keep their account number when they move			0
it is expected to report back next year			2
low interest rates for savers have been blamed on the @entity40 ’s base rate – which has stood at 0.5 per cent for six years – and the government ’s @entity97			0
under @entity97 , the government allowed banks and building societies to borrow £ 80billion at cheap rates if they helped homebuyers and businesses			0
launched in 2012 , the policy was designed to reinvigorate the economy after the financial crisis – but savings rates collapsed , as banks no longer needed new current account customers to fund loans .			0

chancellor @entity12 is considering making the change next week
last year he cut the time it takes to switch accounts from 30 days to seven
now he wants to reduce that further from seven days to just five
he is expected to make the *announcement* during his @entity121 *statement*
however , bankers do not believe the change will make any difference
