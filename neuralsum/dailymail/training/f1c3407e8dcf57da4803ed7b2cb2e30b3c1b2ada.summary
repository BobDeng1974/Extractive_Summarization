instead , the injuries rekindled his feelings for his long - lost love – and he has put an advert in his local newspaper asking for her to get in touch			1
mr @entity7 , who lives in @entity33 , said : ‘ i ’m not sure why we broke up			1
i ’ve regretted not being with her my whole life			2
it ’s only when the memories came back that i realised how much			2
‘ she would be 61 now and i just want a chance to get in touch with her			2
i would love to talk to her and know what happened to her			2
‘ she probably got married and maybe she had children			0
all i know is that her mother wrote to me that all her dreams came true			0
’ this picture shows mr @entity7 with his then girlfriend , @entity9 , when they were together in the 1970s the pair were an item for four years when they lived next door to each other in @entity56 , @entity57			1
she visited him once for a three week holiday in @entity11 , but they then lost touch			1
he said : ‘ i was a little bit older than @entity9 - she was 19 and i was 20 or 21 years old			1
‘ we ’d been together for three or four years when i went back to @entity11			1
i did n’t want to go and i was reluctant to leave her			0

and that was the last time i ever saw her			0
‘ i had a couple of relationships but nothing compared to what i had with @entity9			1
i never really got over her			0
’ mr @entity7 was injured in october 2010 when he slipped on a wet patch of road when he was walking between two parked cars			1
he said : ‘ it was the weirdest feeling			0
i was half - conscious and the only way i can describe it was as though my head was a ton of bricks			0
’ he was rushed for an emergency operation to reduce bleeding on his brain and spent three weeks in hospital recovering			0
@entity85 , who worked as a baggage handler at @entity87 , said : ‘ the surgeon told me i might forget things but it was the total opposite			0
‘ i could remember things i thought i had forgotten			0
i could remember @entity9 's facial expressions , the way she used to cover her top lip over her bottom lip when she was shy			2
‘ she was very shy sometimes back then , but i found it quite endearing			0
’ he placed the advert in the @entity98 to track her down last friday			0
he added : ‘ i know she is probably married now , and i do n't want to cause a fuss or anything , but when i stopped hearing from her mother a few years ago , i feared the worst and it would be nice to just catch up with @entity9 and find out how her life turned out			2
