by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 20 april 2013 favourite : @entity1 with his portrait of the queen lawyers for @entity1 have used intimidating and potentially misleading tactics to stop @entity6 from naming the @entity8 entertainer in the investigation in the wake of the @entity12 abuse claims			1
in a series of threatening emails sent to this paper , @entity14 law firm @entity13 warned of the ‘ highly damaging personal consequences ’ in identifying their client			2
they also brandished @entity21 ’s name to declare there was no public interest in reporting the arrest			0
it meant that for more than four months @entity6 decided not to publish mr @entity1 ’s name in connection with the @entity29 investigation			1
as recently as march 30 , @entity32 bottle ’s senior media lawyer , @entity33 , who has acted for @entity34 , prince @entity35 and the @entity36 , warned : ‘ if you proceed then both you and the editor of your newspaper are on notice of the consequences			2
’ in january , @entity13 ’s was asked to confirm if mr @entity1 had been interviewed by police			1
the firm responded by citing cases of @entity46 peer @entity45 and x factor judge @entity47 , who had been falsely linked to sex offences			2
in fact , these cases were crucially different from mr @entity1 ’s because it was true that mr @entity1 had been interviewed by the police			1
and unlike mr @entity1 , neither man had been interviewed or arrested			1
last night mr @entity47 ’s lawyer @entity55 said it was wrong to compare his client ’s case to that of mr @entity1			1
he said : ‘ the @entity47 case i would distinguish because by the time the @entity61 published the story my client had not been contacted by the police			2
but in @entity1 ’s case , as i understand it , he has been interviewed by the police			2
in my view there is a very important distinction there			0
once you reach the point of interview and arrest there has to be a strong public interest argument in publication			0
the fact that @entity6 held back for four months is a credit to you			0
’ mr @entity33 also tried to keep the case secret by warning us that it would be wrong to publish any of his threatening letters which he said were ‘ strictly private and confidential ’			2
on friday , despite the desperate efforts by mr @entity1 ’s lawyers to suppress news of his arrest , mr @entity1 was finally revealed in newspapers as the ‘ mystery ’ celebrity detained by detectives investigating the @entity12 sex scandal			1
without official and cast - iron confirmation from mr @entity1 or the police this newspaper decided not to reveal his name			1
the paper was also influenced by reports that mr @entity1 had been admitted to @entity100 clinic and that publication could endanger his health			1
last night senior lawyers said that media reports were being suppressed in the wake of @entity21 ’s report into media ethics			0
lawyers cited the cases of @entity47 ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) as reason for us not to name mr @entity1 threat : the emails from @entity115 and @entity116 threatening the @entity6 with action if we named @entity1 in the email comparing mr @entity1 ’s situation to @entity45 , mr @entity33 said : ‘ given recent events and by this we refer specifically to the unfounded allegations that were published against @entity45 and the reporting on 29 november 2012 of the settlement of legal proceedings brought by @entity47 ... arising from circumstances where he was falsely accused of criminal behaviour we are very surprised and indeed highly concerned to note the claims to which you refer			1
’ the ‘ claims ’ , in fact , were only that mr @entity1 had been questioned and his house searched			1
the aggressive denials by mr @entity1 ’s lawyers of their client ’s link to the police investigation played an enormous part in preventing the media from naming him			1
it is now known that on november 24 last year police searched his home in @entity146 , @entity147 , and took away computer equipment and other items			0
@entity1 , who has denied any wrongdoing , was first interviewed under caution – but not arrested – over alleged sex offences on november 29			2
on march 28 police formally arrested him			0
two days later mr @entity33 wrote to the managing editor of @entity6 after police had appeared to confirm the arrest to one of our reporters			0
he said : ‘ we note that you state			0
you are intending to do what no other organisation in this country has done and publish that our client has been arrested on very serious charges			0
the highly damaging personal and legal consequences of doing so will not be lost on you			0
’ mr @entity33 dismissed our source , saying that our ‘ actual knowledge is non-existent ’ and that publication was without any public interest which he said was ‘ self - evident ’ from @entity21 ’s report into media ethics			0
mr @entity1 – a favourite of the @entity174 – had been the only high - profile suspect not to have been @entity177 detention follows the arrests of @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			1
@entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity184 have all publicly denied any wrong - doing and gave statements after their arrests			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

lawyers use *furore* over *innocent* peer to to try and gag us
emails to us from lawyers warned of consequences if we published
mr @entity1 , 83 , was arrested last month as part of @entity199
