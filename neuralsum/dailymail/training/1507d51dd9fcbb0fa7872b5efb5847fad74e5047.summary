by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 14 june 2012 scientists have discovered that planets do not need stars similar to our sun in order to form - implying that @entity8 - like planets are much more abundant than first thought			1
the formation of small worlds like @entity8 previously was thought to occur mostly around stars rich in heavy elements such as iron and silicon			1
however , new ground - based observations , combined with data collected by @entity19 's kepler space telescope , shows small planets form around stars with a wide range of heavy element content - and suggests they may be widespread in our galaxy			1
a research team led by @entity27 , an astrophysicist at the @entity28 and the @entity29 at the @entity30 , studied the elemental composition of more than 150 stars harboring 226 planet candidates smaller than @entity34			1
this artist 's conception shows a newly formed star surrounded by a swirling protoplanetary disk of dust and gas			2
debris coalesces to create rocky ' planetesimals ' that collide and grow to eventually form planets @entity27 said : ' i wanted to investigate whether small planets needed a special environment in order to form , like the giant gas planets , which we know preferentially develop in environments with a high content of heavy elements			1
' this study shows that small planets do not discriminate and form around stars with a wide range of heavy metal content , including stars with only 25 percent of the sun 's metallicity			1
' astronomers refer to all chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as metals			0
they define metallicity is the metal content of heavier elements in a star			0
stars with a higher fraction of heavy elements than the sun are considered metal - rich			1
stars with a lower fraction of heavy elements are considered metal - poor			2
planets are created disks of gas and dust around new stars			2
planets like @entity8 are composed almost entirely of elements such as iron , oxygen , silicon and magnesium			2
the metallicity of a star mirrors the metal content of the planet - forming disk			0
astronomers have hypothesised that large quantities of heavy elements in the disk would lead to more efficient planet formation			1
it has long been noted that giant planets with short orbital periods tend to be associated with metal - rich stars			2
@entity98 scientist @entity97 said ' nature is opportunistic - finding pathways we might otherwise have thought difficult unlike gas giants , the occurrence of smaller planets is not strongly dependent on the heavy element content of their host stars			2
planets up to four times the size of @entity8 can form around stars with a wide range of heavy element content , including stars with a lower metallicity than the sun. the findings are described in a new study published in the journal @entity119			1
' @entity98 has identified thousands of planet candidates , making it possible to study big - picture questions like the one posed by @entity27			0
does nature require special environments to form @entity8 - size planets ? ' said @entity97 , kepler mission scientist at @entity19 's @entity126 at @entity127 , @entity128			1
' the data suggest that small planets may form around stars with a wide range of metallicities - that nature is opportunistic and prolific , finding pathways we might otherwise have thought difficult			1
' the ground - based spectroscopic observations for this study were made at the @entity139 on @entity140 in the @entity141 ; @entity142 on @entity143			0
@entity144 in @entity145 ; @entity146 at the @entity147 ; and @entity148 atop @entity149 in @entity150			0
launched in march 2009 , @entity98 searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars , looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by passing , or transiting , planets			0
at least three transits are required to verify a signal as a planet			0
follow - up observations from ground - based telescopes are also needed to confirm a candidate as a planet			0
@entity126 manages @entity98 's ground system development , mission operations and science data analysis			0
@entity19 's @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity128 , managed the kepler mission development			0
@entity98 is @entity19 's 10th @entity170 and is funded by @entity19 's @entity171 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity174 .			0

planets up to four times the size of @entity8 can form around stars with a wide range of heavy elements
the research by the same team of astronomers also led to evidence that rocky worlds like @entity8 could have formed earlier than expected in the universe 's @entity187 , from the @entity189 , said : ' this work suggests that terrestrial worlds could form at almost any time in our galaxy 's *history* . ' you do *n't* need many earlier generations of stars . ' their discovery supports the ' core *accretion* ' model of planet formation . in this model , *primordial* dust accumulates into mile - sized planetesimals that then coalesce into full - *fledged* planets .
