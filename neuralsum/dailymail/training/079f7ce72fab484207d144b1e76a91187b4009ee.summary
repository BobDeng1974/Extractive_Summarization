' everyone in @entity18 is devastated by what happened , especially @entity41 being the captain of the @entity18 football team , ' said @entity2 's midfield colleague @entity0			1
' that goal obviously meant a lot to @entity41 and we 're all behind him			0
it 's been a difficult time for him but to go out there and play like he has done is fantastic			2
' he 's determined as ever and it did n't affect his performance at all			2
he 's done exactly the same in training because he 's a strong guy and personality and he 's been strong all week			2
' @entity3 endured a torrid opening spell when @entity10 's superiority was complete and finally reflected on the scoreline after 15 minutes when @entity58 netted his sixth goal in seven @entity38 games with a sharp shot on the turn			1
but @entity3 levelled 10 minutes later when @entity64 's clumsy challenge on @entity65 allowed @entity2 to score from the spot and @entity68 's side grew into the game after that			1
@entity0 , pictured celebrating alongside @entity2 , praised his captain following his crucial goal ' we did the same against @entity74 , we did n't start that well but we ended up coming into the game , ' @entity0 said			1
' they had a good start but from there i thought it was 50 - 50 and on another day we could have gone on and nicked it on the counter-attack			0
' it was a good point for us and that 's what we needed after beating @entity74			0
' but everyone 's determined and works their socks off here - the back four , midfield , wingers and strikers			0
' everyone in the team knows they 've got to put a shift in or they 'll be off , so every week we need to go out there and perform			0
' @entity3 's fightback means @entity10 have now lost 13 points from winning positions this season but defender @entity104 insists that worrying trait has not damaged dressing - room morale			1
@entity104 ( right ) hopes his side can get back to winning ways when @entity10 host @entity109 on tuesday ' this is football , it always has to go one way , ' @entity104 said			1
' this is a stat that people can talk about but this is the way it can go			0
you just carry on , it 's not the fact of managing the game			0
' we 've just scored early and we should have made it two or three , but we did n't and that 's it			2
' @entity10 are at home again on tuesday night when they entertain a @entity109 side who climbed off the bottom of the league on saturday with a 3 - 2 victory over @entity131			2
' if we play well and win then this result is forgotten about , ' @entity104 said			0
' it wo n't be an easy game but it 's a home game and hopefully we can go one better than this one			0
' our play in the first half was unbelievable and if we 'd finished a couple of those chances we would have been out of sight			0
' we need to capitalise on our chances because at 1 - 0 games are never finished and you have to try and get another one			0
