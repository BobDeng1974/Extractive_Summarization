@entity0 has been accused of demeaning women and pandering to the sleaziest urges of teenage boys with a new advert comparing playing video games to masturbation			1
the online clip , reportedly published to @entity10 's @entity9 channel on friday , features an attractive woman dressed as a doctor who gives an entire monologue of double entendres			1
' i know you 've already done it today , and i bet you really enjoyed yourself , ' says the woman , who for the purposes of this promotional fantasy is identified as dr @entity20			2
' i know you 've already done it today ' : this is the face of the ' doctor ' in the suggestive new @entity25 advert than was apparently published on @entity0 's @entity9 channel then set to private as a backlash grew she pulls off her spectacles , pouts , leans into the camera and breathes : ' how many times did you do it yesterday ? are you afraid you 're doing it too often ? ' in the bedroom under your blankets ? or perhaps you prefer the kitchen or in the toilet ? or do you like it out in the garden ? ' she continues , climbing onto her desk as close - up shots focus on her full lips			1
' you no longer have to feel ashamed			0
everybody 's doing it , because it 's fantastic			1
and now you can keep going all day long			0
do n't you like that ? you do n't even need to stop			0
and if you want to , you could even join me			0
' at the point the punchline is revealed			0
' dr @entity20 ' was n't being sexually suggestive , she was merely talking about a new remote control feature for her @entity56 hand - held games console			1
@entity57 , chief executive of @entity59 and author of the government review on @entity62 said : ' it ’s a sad poor use of advertising using the innuendo and sex sells type of argument ; the advertising industry is capable of doing much better			0
' really good advertising recognises that the way individuals are portrayed in any public space influences the way we behave in our private lives , and therefore that advertising takes a responsible role in protecting the dignity of all people and ensuring that all are treated with equal respect			2
' @entity59 believes that it is not right to sexually objectify a person or base their value solely on their sexual identity at any age			0
' ' problematic ' : commentators have said the advert plays into old - fashioned ideas about video gamers the @entity94 's @entity93 called the themes exploited by the advert ' problematic '			1
' our sexy doctor is pretty clearly designed to entice the straight teen male demographic gaming companies have been pandering to for decades , ' he wrote			1
' the innuendo makes that clear , even if @entity0 subverts it			0
that 's alienating enough , since gaming has struggled so long for inclusivity			2
' and even if the doctor merrily joins in on the fun ( gaming , that is ) , it 's after the fact — she 's a sexy lady first and a gamer second , never fully eroding what the target always is			1
' @entity113 wrote on @entity114 that @entity0 's playstation advertising had gone from ' clever and weird ' to making him ' think of a ship burning faster than it can sink			2
' @entity118 contacted @entity120 @entity119 for comment , but had received no response by the time of publication .			0
