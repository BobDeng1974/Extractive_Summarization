@entity0 have plugged the gap created by the loss of front row pair @entity3 and @entity5 with the capture of experienced @entity8 forward @entity7 from @entity9			1
the 6ft 7in , 17st - plus @entity10 has signed a two - and - a - half - year contract with the @entity12 and will join them as soon as he receives the necessary paperwork after the @entity9 agreed to release him			1
@entity7 , 30 , who has made 200 appearances @entity17 , will link up with his old @entity19 team - mate @entity18 , the new @entity0 captain who on tuesday signed a two - year contract extension , and is a like - for - like replacement for @entity3 , who announced his retirement due to injury last month			1
@entity8 forward @entity7 will move from @entity9 to @entity0 on a two - and - a - half - year deal the @entity9 have agreed to release the 6ft 7in forward and only paperwork delays his start for the @entity12 rovers , who have appointed former @entity31 captain @entity30 as their football manager for 2016 , were further depleted in the front row when they agreed to release @entity34 prop @entity5 for personal reasons			1
@entity7 comes in after the sudden retirement of @entity3 and @entity5 's departure @entity0 head coach @entity38 , who had been linked with a move for @entity10 's @entity19 team - mate @entity40 , said : ' it 's no secret that we 've been short on numbers in the front row after the departures of @entity46 and @entity5 and we wanted to strengthen in that area			1
' our forwards have coped very well in the circumstances but we 've been scouring the market for props and we 're delighted to be bringing in someone of @entity7 's calibre			2
' he 's got a very good pedigree over in the @entity55 and he 's coming here in what should be the prime of his career for a front rower			0
' we 're excited to see him take to the field for us and he 'll be a big part of the squad moving forwards			0
we 've got to go through the necessary process regarding his visa , but we 're hopeful of having him on board in the next three to four weeks			0
' @entity7 , a former @entity70 who was an ever - present for @entity19 in both 2013 and 2014 , said he spoke to former @entity0 hooker @entity72 , who joined the @entity9 at the end of last season , before finalising the move			1
' it 's a new challenge for me to come over there and it 's one i 'm really looking forward to , ' @entity7 said			2
' everybody i 've spoken to has had good things to say about @entity28 and it sounds like a club on the way up			0
' i 've had a brief chat to @entity72 and he spoke very highly of the club , as did @entity3 's dad			2
i played with @entity46 at @entity19 and his old man said how much he 'd enjoyed it over there			0
@entity7 will link up with his former @entity9 team - mate @entity18 , the new @entity0 captain ' it 's a different style of game in @entity91 , it 's not so much about the wrestle and defence like the @entity55 , so i 'm looking forward to a fresh start			1
' i 've been at @entity19 for 10 years now and it 's time for me to be taken out of my comfort zone , but i 'm 30 years old , i 'm an experienced player and i 'm more than confident i can handle the change			0
' i was already thinking of coming over to @entity91 next season , but this was too good an opportunity to turn down			0
' @entity19 have been really good with me , so hopefully i can play a couple more games here over the next few weeks and then get across to @entity0 '			0

@entity3 and @entity5 's sudden departures left huge void
@entity7 is to sign a two - and - a - half - year contract with @entity0
