by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:40 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 17 july 2013 millions of pounds in benefits are to be offered to communities to persuade people to agree to new nuclear power stations being built near their homes			2
towns and villages near eight sites in @entity10 and @entity11 will be offered up to £ 1,000 for every megawatt hour of electricity generated for 40 years			1
it means people living near @entity15 in @entity16 are in line for £ 128million if a new nuclear generator goes ahead			1
cash : communities near new nuclear power stations will receive millions in bribes , including @entity15 in @entity16 ( pictured ) which is in line for £ 128million energy minister @entity22 insisted it is ‘ absolutely essential ’ to recognise the contribution towns and villages make to national energy security by having a reactor built nearby			1
under the package , councils would benefit for up to the first 10 years of operation of a nuclear power plant from a share of the increased business rates revenues that will be generated			0
then during the second phase of the programme there would be annual taxpayer - funded payments between 2030 and 2060 from the @entity38 to communities hosting nuclear power plants			0
mr @entity22 said : ‘ new nuclear will have a central role to play in our energy strategy , providing heat and light to homes across the country			2
energy minister @entity22 said the funding was ' absolutely essential ' ‘ it is absolutely essential that we recognise the contributions of those communities that host major new energy projects			1
‘ this package is in the interests of local people , who will manage it to ensure long - term meaningful benefit to the community			2
‘ it 's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs , investment and use of local services			0
’ community benefits packages have been announced for other controversial energy infrastructure , including onshore wind farms and ‘ fracking ’ for shale gas , but in those cases the developer will pay for them			0
@entity81 , a county councillor in @entity16 , welcome the funds for the area near @entity15			1
he added : ‘ the money is a tremendous asset to our county and will help create jobs and apprenticeships , provide essential improvements like affordable housing and regenerate areas that could really do with financial help			2
construction of the first of a planned new generation of nuclear reactors at @entity15 has stalled as @entity98 and officials have so far failed to agree a price for the electricity which will be generated from the @entity15 site			1
but dr @entity103 , chief scientist at @entity104 , said : ‘ whilst wind farms and even shale gas developers have to pay community benefits , only nuclear stations will get a fat taxpayer subsidy to fund them			0
‘ our entire energy policy is now absurdly distorted by the desperation to prop up @entity98 's faltering @entity115 project , with the government piling the costs on to the taxpayer to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they backed the wrong technology			0
we ca n't go on like this			0

cash on offer for eight sites in @entity10 and @entity11 to agree to new reactors
it could be worth £ 128million for people near @entity15 in @entity16
energy minister @entity22 says money is ' absolutely essential '
