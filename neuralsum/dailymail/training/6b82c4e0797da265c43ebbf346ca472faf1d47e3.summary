there is a real danger of @entity2 becoming the @entity4 ’s greatest striker of all - time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes - per - goal record which even tops @entity7			1
the @entity9 man scored the only goal in sunday ’s derby win against rivals @entity12 – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes			1
it was @entity2 ’s 62nd in the league for @entity9 – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of @entity7 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity9 striker @entity2 has netted 62 @entity4 goals in 6783 minutes in @entity19 @entity2 converts @entity21 's low cross from the left to put @entity9 1 - 0 ahead in the derby @entity2 ( second from left ) is mobbed by his team - mates after giving the hosts the lead against @entity12 @entity7 is widely - regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the @entity4 not only that , the 26 - year - old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992			1
@entity7 – @entity36 ’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 @entity4 games			1
widely - regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era , @entity7 ’s capability of scoring 20 - a - season in double - quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been			2
even superior to @entity17 , who ended his career with more , 260 , but took longer in between strikes to find the net			0
@entity16 ’s trailblazing four campaigns at @entity12 – ignoring the injury - ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes			0
@entity53 ’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal , while the year spent in @entity19 by @entity55 had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes			2
@entity12 skipper @entity58 , on the other hand , has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the @entity4			2
that is n’t a record to be sniffed at			0
it comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes			0
@entity2 ’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half - an - hour more impressive than @entity66 and @entity67 – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced @entity19 football			1
@entity7 comfortably finishes past @entity71 goalkeeper @entity70 in an @entity73 tie @entity2 has a better minutes - per - goal ratio than @entity75 talisman @entity66 ( celebrating at @entity76 ) @entity17 's goals were crucial in @entity78 winning the 1995 @entity4 title ( @entity80 right ) detractors may point to the @entity9 striker ’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named no 1			1
but even last year , when @entity2 spent two months on the sidelines , he was up there with @entity66 and @entity90			2
his manager @entity91 said last december that this season ’s top scorer was a better player than the @entity94			0
‘ @entity66 is a very important striker , but i think @entity2 participates more in the game , ’ @entity91 claimed			1
‘ he has always been a top player and he has always scored goals , but i think at this moment , he has added working for the team without the ball , which is also important for him			0
’ @entity17 scored 260 @entity4 goals , most marked with his trademark celebration the bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play @entity58 is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of @entity53 and @entity107 the @entity108 certainly is n’t wrong – @entity2 contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for			1
there was never any danger of @entity21 ’s centre not ending up nestled beyond @entity114 at the @entity115 this weekend			0
it is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart			0
he rarely needs more than one chance			0
while @entity2 offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders , there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all - time @entity4 list			2
@entity107 , now at @entity131 , was renowned for doing very little in @entity12 games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area , while @entity135 – whose record is only topped by @entity7 and @entity2 – has forever been an impact substitute			1
@entity139 's goalscoring record while at @entity71 puts him among the @entity4 's elite @entity141 ( pictured scoring for @entity142 against @entity143 in 1995 ) scored picture - book goals @entity145 used @entity135 as a super sub - but his minutes - per - goal ratio was exemplary @entity148 often saved @entity12 late on in games after being called from the bench @entity17 was chief penalty taker wherever he played , while @entity139 ’s 20 @entity71 goals tended to come in gluts ( and often from the bench ) before @entity155 sent him packing			1
unsurprisingly , both @entity148 and @entity163 feature , although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair did n’t spend so much time coming back from injuries			0
@entity165 ’s @entity164 makes the list , but his four years at @entity167 from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals , with @entity141 ’s record slightly more impressive			0
of the current crop to surprise , @entity170 and @entity171 both make the top 25			0
whether @entity2 ’s record can be beaten remains to be seen , but it looks doubtful .			2

@entity9 striker pips @entity7 in the charts
@entity2 scores once every 109 @entity4 minutes
@entity66 , @entity53 and @entity67 also high up
@entity135 the surprise name in third place
