teenage winger @entity0 continued his blazing start to his @entity3 career with a hat - trick of tries on his home debut but in - form @entity7 made sure there was no happy return to the @entity10 for @entity11 as they went down 24 - 18			1
the 17 - year - old scored all of his side 's tries to take his tally to eight in just four appearances as @entity11 appeared in front of their own fans for the first time in two months			1
however , the @entity10 is a happy hunting ground for the @entity7 , who have not lost there since 2007 , and they ground out an eighth successive win to maintain their surge up the table			1
blazing start : @entity11 's @entity0 scored a hat - trick of tries during friday 's defeat to @entity7 @entity11 lost scrum - half @entity32 with concussion after only five minutes but @entity35 proved a useful replacement and they opened the scoring with a penalty from teenage stand - off @entity39			1
the visitors struggled most with the wet ball and @entity11 punished a fumble by hooker @entity43 on 17 minutes , with @entity39 kicking the loose ball on for @entity45 to open his account			0
most of the @entity7 fans failed to reach @entity11 because of the closure of the @entity50 but , as their numbers gradually swelled , so their team began to make their presence felt too			1
centre @entity54 collected @entity57 's high kick on the last tackle but was prevented from grounding the ball and @entity11 full - back @entity60 was forced to scramble to deny stand - off @entity61 after he had charged down @entity39 's attempted clearance kick			2
the @entity7 ' first try eventually fell to loose forward @entity64 but the architect was full - back @entity66 with a determined 60 - metre run in which he fended off a host of would - be tacklers to create the position for @entity54 to supply the final pass			2
bridge 's conversion tied the scores but @entity75 edged @entity11 back in front with a penalty before @entity7 struck again in the final minute of the first half			2
@entity57 came up with a perfectly - weighted grubber kick that bounced kindly for centre @entity80 to touch down , with @entity61 adding the goal to make it 12 - 8 at the break			0
@entity61 extended the lead with a penalty early in the second half , clearly sensing that points would be hard to come by in the difficult conditions			0
both sides continued to fritter away possession and @entity11 took full advantage of @entity7 winger @entity93 's knock - on from a scrum on his own 20 - metre line			1
skipper @entity96 got over the line only to lose his grip on the ball but then sent out a superb pass for @entity45 to finish decisively to claim his second try			0
@entity103 's missed kick left his side trailing by two points and they fell further behind on the hour when @entity107 took @entity57 's pass to charge over for the visitors ' third try , to which @entity61 added his fourth goal			0
and there was no way back for the home side when @entity54 split their defence on 66 minutes for @entity117 to get @entity93 over for their fourth try			0
@entity11 made the most of another handling error from the visitors to get @entity45 over for his third try three minutes from the end and @entity103 's touchline conversion cut the gap to just six points but it came too late to affect the result .			0

@entity0 continues *excellent* start to @entity3 career with hat - trick at the @entity10
however @entity11 teenager was on the losing side as @entity7 won 24 - 18
