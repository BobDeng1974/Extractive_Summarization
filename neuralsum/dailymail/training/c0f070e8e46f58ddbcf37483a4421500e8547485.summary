by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is sporting blue lips , courtesy of an ice cream he has just consumed in what appears to be a rather desperate effort to remain awake			1
two coffees and a water have already been demolished , with @entity11 ’s manager admitting he did not sleep well after seeing his side lose to @entity13 at home the previous evening			1
‘ i watched it again , ’ he says			2
‘ i was frustrated because we did n’t perform like we should			2
before i knew , it ’s 4am			2
i must have had two hours ’ sleep			2
’ video : scroll down to watch @entity2 's views ahead of the @entity22 showdown up for the @entity23 ! @entity2 is hoping to upset @entity24 in the @entity23 semi-final showdown at @entity22 @entity2 believes in such detailed analysis			1
he says he studied last season ’s @entity23 final before @entity11 met @entity29 in this season ’s quarter - final , publicly acknowledging predecessor @entity33 ’s contribution in demonstrating how to conquer their super-rich opponents			1
and this week @entity2 was thanking @entity33 again , this time for providing a few pointers in how to beat @entity24			1
having watched @entity33 ’s @entity37 thrash @entity24 3 - 0 last weekend , @entity2 has taken what he can into his preparation for today ’s semi-final at @entity22			1
@entity33 has been hugely supportive , says @entity2			1
‘ i like @entity33 , ’ he says			1
‘ we had dinner soon after i came here			2
he is a very friendly , very helpful man			2
i like to soak up as much information as i can and he is one of the top managers			2
i ’ve studied him very much , was n’t surprised he found a tactic to cause @entity47 problems			2
i was very impressed with how good @entity37 were at the beginning of the game without the ball — to break the rhythm , to deny them space , to counter-attack quickly			1
‘ i was also impressed by how disciplined they were			2
it was good for a young manager to see			2
’ top tips : @entity2 has been taking inspiration from former @entity61 manager @entity33 blueprint : @entity33 's @entity37 side crushed @entity24 3 - 0 in their last @entity65 game @entity2 is not offended by comparisons with @entity33			1
he modestly suggests he would be happy to be only half as successful as the @entity68			2
but the 45 - year - old @entity69 has his own values and beliefs			1
he is his own man ; the product of a very different system to the one that nurtured @entity33			1
in his recent autobiography he writes at length about his upbringing in the @entity80			1
in these pages he told how the @entity82 , the @entity69 secret police , tried to recruit him			1
but it is interesting to hear how much he feels he owes to the government - funded education he received			1
he was just 11 years old when he moved from the family home in @entity88 to an elite sports school in @entity90			2
but , like many boarding - school pupils everywhere , he insists it was the making of them			1
‘ it made me the person i am , ’ he says			2
‘ to survive an elite sports school like that — it provided intense competition from a very young age and i am driven by competition			2
’ @entity100 to head : @entity2 's @entity11 will be overwhelming underdogs against @entity47 's @entity24 at @entity22 as we chat in a @entity11 restaurant , @entity2 recalls stories that would horrify most of us			1
as well as those attempts to recruit him , he says he suspects team - mates , friends , even members of his extended family were already working as @entity82 informants to keep tabs on him			1
‘ you knew people were looking at you , and after you , too , ’ he says			0
‘ you were aware you were being watched , even if you were never sure who it was watching you			2
it could be friends , family members at times , definitely my team - mates — informants			2
you knew you needed to be careful about what you said			0
‘ but when the government has invested time and money in you , they want to make sure you are not looking to leave the country			0
it would have been a defeat for the philosophy of the government to have something like that happen			0
’ against all odds : @entity11 pulled off a major upset by defeating @entity29 in last season 's @entity23 final @entity2 ’s defence of the system — for instance , he insists all those @entity139 and world medals were ‘ not just down to doping ’ — reveals an admiration for discipline and hard work			1
not to mention a scouting system he says was employed by @entity69 football in 2000 when they revolutionised their youth programme			0
‘ a lot of those principles came from @entity80 , ’ he says , while insisting he had no experience of doping in his sport			1
catch @entity24 on the @entity154 's tactics of soaking up pressure and breaking in numbers worked against @entity29 in last year ’s final			1
expect more of the same from @entity2 ’s team			1
exploit wide open @entity160 @entity159 and @entity161 were key figures in last season 's @entity22 upset and are fit after injury			1
@entity2 could have two aces up his sleeve			1
rough them up a @entity169 are a more physical side under @entity2			1
the likes of @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 unsettled @entity29 in the last round and @entity24 could be more susceptible			1
he nevertheless feels fortunate because the fall of the @entity177 enabled him to head west and make a good living — and help him enjoy an enduring love affair with @entity29			0
‘ i consider myself very lucky to have lived 20 years in one system and now more than 20 years in another , ’ @entity2 continues			1
‘ it makes me more rounded			0
my dna is still made from that time			0
also from my parents : normal working - class people			2
‘ some i knew in @entity80 were not so lucky			1
coming to the end of their careers , they were born at the wrong time			0
’ this is the kind of consideration a 45 - year - old @entity2 likes to show his players today			1
‘ i am a communicator , ’ he says			0
‘ i communicate with players all the time			0
i want to know how they feel			0
i want to know how their private life is			0
i want to know so i treat them in the best possible way			0
’ early education : as a player , @entity2 was schooled in @entity80 before coming to @entity29 in 1994 there is a sense of perspective here			1
something that comes , he says , from his experience of serious illness			2
more specifically his battle with non-hodgkin lymphoma 11 years ago			0
‘ it has definitely given me a greater sense of perspective , ’ he says , ‘ because you never know what is around the corner			0
‘ i was 34 and they said i would not make it through @entity216			0
i was protected from that at the time			0
my wife ( @entity218 ) was told but she did not tell me at the time			0
she ’s a very strong person			0
‘ it has made me appreciate more the family time			0
in my job there is not much family time but mine supported me through everything			0
i want to be the best i can be but my family , my children , they are important too			0
’ keeping his family happy was a factor in his decision to move from @entity231 to @entity11 last december			1
ambition was also an element but taking his family back to @entity235 was a further incentive			0
so was the opportunity to work for @entity238			0
danger men : @entity161 ( @entity240 ) and @entity159 have been marked as the players to test @entity24 ‘ i liked what he and the club represented , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ stable ownership , stable finances , a short line of communication			0
and i could be with my family in @entity249			0
‘ before i went to @entity231 there were four interviews			1
with the owner here i went to his house			0
not just about football but about life , and after 45 minutes he said the job was mine			0
“ just do n’t be greedy , ” he then told me			0
’ whatever @entity238 is paying @entity2 , he must consider it money well spent			1
the @entity69 has not just restored stability after @entity263 ’s troubled tenure			0
he has guided them into a play - off position , six points clear of seventh - placed @entity267 with five games left , and he has followed @entity33 in masterminding another astonishing @entity23 run			1
it is also worth noting that the @entity231 side he left is within touching distance of automatic promotion from @entity274			1
‘ my philosophy is to work with young players , @entity277 players , ’ he says			0
‘ the talent is here			0
the players are well educated but they do n’t always get the opportunity			0
i try to identify those players			0
it worked at @entity231 and it is working at @entity11			1
’ not again ! @entity2 does not want a repeat of his @entity22 loss with @entity231 in last season 's play - off final mention of @entity231 does , of course , bring him back to @entity22 and the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity288 in last year ’s play - off final			1
‘ that was not a good memory , ’ he says			0
‘ after all that happened , after the way we missed out on automatic promotion by losing to @entity295 on the last day , i needed a holiday to overcome it			2
the first three days i was just sleeping			0
’ he would hope to sleep better after tomorrow .			0
