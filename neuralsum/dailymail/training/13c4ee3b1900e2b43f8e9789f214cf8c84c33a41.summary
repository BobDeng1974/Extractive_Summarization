by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 5 december 2013 it may not have all the bells and whistles as a brand new @entity4 , or even look particularly pretty , but if all you want a phone for is to make calls and send texts , why not build your own ? created by the co-founder of the @entity12 platform , the wooden handset features a circuit board , a small led display , buttons , a speaker and microphone			1
it can store numbers , make and receive calls , send texts and be used as an alarm clock			1
the basic phone , pictured , has been created by engineer and co-founder of the @entity12 circuit board @entity26			1
it features a display , buttons , speaker and microphone and can connect to mobile networks			1
this means the phone can store numbers , make and receive calls , send texts and be used as an alarm clock @entity39 is a customisable smartphone made up of what 's called ' modular elements ' , or blocks , that can be instantly swapped and replaced			1
if a battery dies , for example , a new one can be clipped into place			0
storage can be upgraded or cameras with different lenses an be swapped in and out depending on the occasion			0
the designs , by @entity52 inventor @entity39 , were recently bought by @entity54 - owned @entity53 as part of @entity56			0
@entity12 is a small open - source platform which comes with a circuit board , and software that tells people how program it			1
it is used to power a variety of electronic devices			0
engineer @entity26 from @entity66 ’s @entity65 helped set up the @entity12 project and has now used it to make a @entity69 feature phone			2
@entity26 has put the blueprints for the phone , as well as instructions on how to program the board on @entity74			2
programmers can either buy a starter pack of basic components , or use the instructions to design and buy their own			0
@entity26 ' version has a wooden casing that is laser - cut using plywood			0
it has a total of 60 components including the board , the speaker and microphone to make calls , an led display and a sim card holder			1
programmers can either buy a starter pack of components , or use @entity26 ' instructions to design their own			0
the original design 's casing is made from laser - cut plywood , pictured the phone is powered by an @entity100 circuit board , pictured			1
@entity12 is an open - source platform which comes with a circuit board , and software that tells people how program it			2
it can be used to power a variety of electronic devices once the three main pieces of the @entity69 phone are built , pictured , they can be slotted together to make the finished phone the particular @entity12 board used in the phone is based on the @entity100 model , designed to let @entity12 - based machines access mobile networks			1
this also means that the phone connects to the internet so people can add their own , larger display if they want to			2
the basic version can make and receive calls , text messages , store names and numbers , and display the time , however , it does not feature apps			1
@entity74 has additionally uploaded the circuit board designs to online firm @entity132 which will print three copies for around $ 60 ( £ 36 )			2
the components and circuit board are protected by a rubber sleeve , pictured , held together by small screws			1
the led display is built into this protective sleeve @entity26 said the total project should cost around $ 200 ( £ 121 ) to complete			2
users will need to pay separately for a sim card and call plan			0
his designs provide a framework but they can be adapted to create a range of different looking handsets , pictured @entity26 said the total project should cost around $ 200 ( £ 121 ) to complete			0
users will need to pay separately for a sim card and call plan			0
he describes the phone as ‘ a difficult but potentially do - able project ’ and his version only works on networks in @entity156			0
however , the phone can be adapted to be used in other countries .			0

@entity69 phone runs on an @entity12 circuit board connected to a mobile network
it features a small led display , buttons , speaker and microphone
casing is made of wood and the board is protected inside a rubber sleeve
the basic model can make and receive calls , send texts and store numbers
