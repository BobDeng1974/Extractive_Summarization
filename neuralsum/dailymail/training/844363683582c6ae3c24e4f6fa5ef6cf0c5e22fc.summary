@entity12 is accused of bringing @entity14 's ' young life to a horrific end ' , prosecutors said on the opening day of his trial in @entity18 , @entity19 , yesterday			1
they have asked jurors to find the day labourer guilty of the first - degree murder of @entity24 teenager , who was found dead in the driver 's seat of her car on june 27 , 2010			1
' this is not a case that is about who , ' defence attorney @entity44 said in his opening statement yesterday , according to the @entity47			1
' this is a case about why			2
it is a perfect storm of tragedy			0
' for two and a half years miss @entity14 's killing remained one of the area 's most notorious unsolved murders			1
despite finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver 's seat , the dna evidence did n't match anyone in the police database			1
a break in the case came only in april 2012 when @entity64 was arrested for stealing three bottles of @entity67 champagne from a @entity69 , @entity19 shop			1
it was n't until last december that investigators matched @entity12 's prints to the dna found on the murder weapon and arrested the man			1
@entity12 's trial for miss @entity14 's murder began yesterday			1
initially , his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed , claiming that the media 's coverage of the investigation tainted their client 's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected			1
@entity18 circuit court judge @entity89 dismissed that claim thursday , saying all of the evidence reported in the @entity47 would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press			1
taken : @entity96 was home for the summer , looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death giving @entity12 a ride @entity96 had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the @entity108			0
she was living with her mother at their apartment in @entity24 , and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed			2
@entity96 was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend @entity115 who lived in @entity117			0
around 2:45 p.m. she decided to go to the @entity118 to get her eyebrows done at @entity120			0
it was while leaving the salon that she first encountered @entity12 , standing outside holding his 1 - year - old daughter			2
@entity12 started his day by going into @entity125 with his daughter to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity3			0
when he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid @entity3 before going to the mall with his daughter			0
according to court documents , by the time he approached @entity96 outside the mall , he was having a ' severe @entity3 intoxication ' and asked the young woman to take him and his daughter to the hospital			0
surveillance footage subsequently shows @entity96 's white @entity136 exiting the parking lot			2
taken for a ride : @entity96 agreed to take @entity12 and his 1 - year - old daughter to the hospital , but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car according to an account given to police by @entity12 , @entity96 accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted			1
' @entity14 did nothing wrong , ' a detective paraphrased @entity12 in a report made after his arrest			1
at this point , @entity12 was hallucinating and believed that @entity96 was going to harm his daughter or call the police , so he acted			2
he took out a butcher 's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a ravine on the side of the road			2
@entity12 ditched the knife and left @entity96 to die , fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof			0
a driver spotted the car at 3:34pm , less than half a mile from the mall and called police			1
when police arrived , they found @entity96 belted into her seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning			1
but police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect			2
severely intoxicated : @entity12 has spent his day traveling into @entity125 to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity3 with his daughter , and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center even though the knife was left in the car , the dna evidence produced no matches in the police database			2
investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe @entity96 had any enemies or was in any trouble			0
they canvassed the area around the mall and collected dna from @entity96 's friends and family , local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall , but again , no matches			0
@entity96 's story was even highlighted on tv show ' @entity200 ' to no avail			0
it was n't until almost two years later that @entity12 was arrested for stealing two bottles of @entity204 at a grocery store in @entity69 , @entity19			1
even then , it took police until last december 10 to make the connection with his prints			0
' [ @entity12 ] was arrested in april for larceny of champagne			0
imagine that ! ' wrote @entity18 police detective @entity213 in an email that day			1
a few days later @entity12 was arrested at his job site in @entity216 , @entity19			0
he said he never told anyone about the killing			0

@entity12 has not yet entered a plea			0
his first day in court is scheduled for august 19 .			0

@entity14 , 19 , was discovered in the driver 's seat of her crashed car on june 27 , 2010 with 13 stab wounds
