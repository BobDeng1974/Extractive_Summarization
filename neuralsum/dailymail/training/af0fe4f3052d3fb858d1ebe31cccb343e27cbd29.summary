scientists have discovered that nature created mechanical gears long before man made cars and bikes - in the legs of a tiny jumping insect			1
the @entity9 bug , a plant hopping garden dweller , has curved cog - like strips of teeth on each hind leg which interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump			1
the discovery proves that gear mechanisms previously thought to be a solely man made invention were in fact first created by nature			0
the @entity9 ' rear legs has curved cog - like strips of opposing teeth hat intermesh , rotating like mechanical gears scientists at @entity29 made the discovery using a combination of body structure analysis and high - speed video			1
‘ we usually think of gears as something that we see in human designed machinery , but we ’ve found that that is only because we did n’t look hard enough , ’ said @entity34 and paper author @entity35			2
‘ these gears are not designed ; they are evolved - representing high speed and precision machinery evolved for synchronisation in the animal world			0
’ each gear on the @entity48 leg is around 400 micrometres long , and there are between ten and 12 teeth on each leg the gears on the opposing hind legs lock together like those in in car gear box to make sure the legs are completely synchronised when they move the @entity56 is fairly common in @entity57 , especially in the southeast , but rarer in @entity59 and @entity60			1
it is found on a range of woody plants , including most common deciduous trees			0
the @entity9 bug , a plant hopping garden dweller , has curved cog - like strips of teeth on each hind leg which interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump			1
the insects legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other , with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second			0
the mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect , and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase			1
each gear tooth on the insect ’s legs has a rounded corner at the point it connects with the other gears to stop teeth from shearing off when they clash , similar to gears on a bike			2
the gears on the opposing hind legs lock together like those in in car gear box to make sure the legs are completely synchronised when they move			0
this is critical for powerful jumps as even a tiny discrepancy in the timing between the legs would see , the little @entity9 spin out of control			0
the legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other , with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second			0
‘ this precise synchronisation would be impossible to achieve through a nervous system , as neural impulses would take far too long for the extraordinarily tight coordination required , ’ said lead author professor @entity103			0
‘ by developing mechanical gears , the @entity9 can just send nerve signals to its muscles to produce roughly the same amount of force - then if one leg starts to propel the jump the gears will interlock , creating absolute synchronicity			1
the mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect , and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase the legs always move within 30 microseconds of each other , with one microsecond equal to a millionth of a second ‘ in @entity9 , the skeleton is used to solve a complex problem that the brain and nervous system ca n’t			1
‘ this emphasises the importance of considering the properties of the skeleton in how movement is produced			0
’ the mechanical gears are only found in the juvenile insect , and are lost when the bug grows into its adult phase			1
it is not yet known why this happens , but scientists think it could be because if one tooth on the gear breaks , the whole mechanism is damaged , and while juveniles can self - repair , any damage in adulthood is permanent			0
each gear on the @entity9 ’ leg is around 400 micrometres long , and there are between ten and 12 teeth on each leg			2
unlike man - made gears , each gear tooth is asymmetrical and curved towards the point where the cogs interlock			1
this is because man - made gears need a symmetric shape to work in both rotational directions , whereas the @entity9 gears are only powering one way to launch the animal forward			2
while there are examples of cogs in the animal kingdom , such as on the shell of a turtle , gears with a functioning role have never been found until now			2
the findings are reported in the latest issue of the journal @entity170 .			0

the @entity9 bug has curved cog - like strips of teeth on each hind leg
these cogs can interlock and rotate like mechanical gears to help it jump
this is the first time that mechanical gears similar have been found in nature
