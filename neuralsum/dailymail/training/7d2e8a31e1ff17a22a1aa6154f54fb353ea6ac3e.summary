three men accused in the latest @entity2 spy case did n't hide behind fake identities and were n't stealing military secrets			1
the evidence even suggests they were annoyed that their assignment was n't more like a @entity9 film			0
their alleged plot to dig up ' economic intelligence ' on possible banking penalties and alternative energy sources may not be the stuff of @entity17 movies , but @entity19 authorities insist the case is proof that @entity2 spying is thriving in @entity19 more than two decades after the end of the @entity23			1
it also shows the time and resources the @entity19 still throws at those suspected of being @entity29 - era spies , using methods developed before many of them were born : listening bugs , hidden cameras and intercepted phone calls			2
authorities say @entity38 's activities , as well as those of his alleged cohorts @entity45 and @entity46 , indicate a continued @entity2 spy presence in the country real threat : @entity19 attorney @entity50 says the threat of @entity2 espionage is real , over 20 years after the end of the @entity23 ' @entity2 spies continue to seek to operate in our midst , ' @entity19 attorney @entity50 warned after the arrests last week			1
@entity2 @entity59 spokesman @entity58 countered by accusing @entity19 authorities of manufacturing a spy scandal as part of its ' anti-russian campaign			1
' @entity65 , a @entity66 professor and former federal prosecutor , said the latest case should n't be taken lightly			0
' we have to be concerned about the economic warfare end of this			1
that 's what worries me , ' she said , noting the recent crippling cyberattack on @entity77 involving the movie ' the interview			0
' she said the arrests might demonstrate that the spy game has changed as countries seek information to poise themselves to attack businesses and the economy			0
' it 's not looking for military secrets			0
that 's almost passe now , ' @entity65 said			0
the case against @entity38 , @entity45 and @entity46 comes less than five years after the arrest of 10 covert agents - a sleeper cell referred to as ' the @entity94 ' by the @entity95 , the foreign intelligence agency headquartered in @entity96 - who led ordinary lives for several years in the @entity19 using aliases			1
all 10 pleaded guilty in federal court in @entity101 to conspiracy charges and were ordered out of the country as part of a spy swap for four people convicted of betraying @entity96 to the @entity107			0
federal prosecutors in @entity109 brought another spy case in 2013 , accusing @entity111 , a naturalized @entity19 citizen from @entity112 who made millions off his @entity114 export firm , of being a secret agent for the @entity2 military			1
@entity111 , who pleaded not guilty , is scheduled to go to trial later this year			0
not everyone views the latest case as a scary new wrinkle in spy tactics			0
' what is interesting about this case , just like the 2010 sleeper spy case , is how little these accused @entity2 spies are accomplishing			2
either the @entity126 is just getting the low - hanging fruit , or the @entity2 foreign intelligence agency is n't doing its job very well , ' said @entity130 , a political scientist at @entity131 , @entity132			2
prosecutors say the latest investigation exposed espionage by @entity136 and @entity46 , who held low - level diplomatic positions , and @entity38 , a @entity139 resident with a valid visa , a position in the @entity101 branch of a @entity2 bank and a @entity145 profile			1
no joke : authorities claim spies like those in this latest case are in the @entity19 to undermine the country 's economic foundations @entity19 prosecutors say that under orders from @entity96 , @entity136 's main duty was to give @entity38 assignments to gather intelligence on potential @entity19 sanctions against @entity2 banks and efforts here to develop alternative energy resources			1
they say @entity45 and @entity46 would analyze the information and report back to the @entity95 behind the walls of a @entity2 office in @entity40 they thought was secure but apparently was bugged			1
in a secretly recorded conversation , @entity46 let down his guard and complained to @entity136 that their work was nothing like ' movies about @entity9 , ' according to the papers			2
' of course , i would n't fly helicopters , but pretend to be someone else at a minimum , ' he said			0
@entity45 griped that he too thought he ' at least would go abroad with a different passport			2
' the court papers also detail demands on @entity38 from @entity95 to come up with questions for a @entity2 ' news organization ' - believed to be @entity181 - to ask about the inner workings of the @entity19 stock market			1
the conversation was an exception to how the pair normally did business , prosecutors said			0
typically , they would speak on the phone in code to set up meetings in outdoor settings , with ' @entity38 passing a bag , magazine or slip of paper to @entity136 , ' court papers said			2
some of the meetings took place near @entity38 's red - brick home on a quiet block in the @entity202 section of the @entity139 , not far from a monolithic high - rise used to house @entity2 diplomats			1
economic warfare ? authorities worry that the presence of spies like @entity38 , @entity136 and @entity46 could undermine the countries economic security @entity38 , 39 , masked this work by posing as a banker for @entity2 's @entity212 , ( pictured ) according to the complaint and the bank 's website neighbors said 39 - year - old @entity38 , his wife and two children largely kept to themselves			1
they recalled a man sitting in a car on the block for hours at a time - in hindsight , they say , probably surveillance - but were surprised when the @entity126 raided the home last monday			0
' i got home from work and saw all these cars , about 10 of them , blocking the street			0
one blocked my driveway , ' said @entity234 , who lives across the street			0
' we did n't know what was happening			0
' a judge ordered @entity38 held without bail			2
@entity46 and @entity136 , whose diplomatic status gave them immunity , have returned to @entity2			1
@entity181 reported that @entity2 diplomats had visited @entity38 in a federal lockup in lower @entity101 and found conditions of his confinement ' satisfactory			2
' a @entity2 spokesman told the news agency that @entity38 ' vehemently denies the alleged offenses			1
' undercover : @entity249 was one of a large @entity2 spy ring arrested in @entity40 and @entity251 in 2010 infiltrated : @entity249 and her fellow spies lived apparently normal @entity19 lives			1
she refused to comment today on the arrest of an alleged member of a new spy ring			0

@entity38 is one of three @entity2 accused of operating in @entity40 to gain ' economic intelligence ' and *recruit*
@entity19 attorneys warn the *discovery* of @entity38 **--** and his cohorts @entity45 and @entity46 **--** means espionage is alive and well
authorities say their alleged activities reveal a continued threat of economic warfare on the @entity19
