the group of people had found themselves stuck in a lift in @entity10 , @entity11 when its doors opened to reveal a brick wall , the management 's way of keeping people from entering the building from the car park			1
one man managed to make a hole in the brick wall with a hammer , but as a young man begins to climb through , feet first , the lift moves			1
a maintenance worker who happened to have a hammer can be seen attacking the wall , causing the others in the lift to panic			0
as soon as there is a small hole in the brick wall , one of the men begins to squeeze through			2

broken : the group of people had found themselves stuck in a lift when its doors opened to reveal a brick wall , the management 's way of keeping people from entering the building from the car park escape route : a maintenance worker , who happened to have a hammer , can be seen attacking the brick wall rescue worker @entity65 told local media : ' it was an extremely foolish thing to do , it was relatively easy to reactivate the lift and override the safety function to move into the next floor			1
' ' it was only by chance that we checked the cctv cameras and realised the was a man stuck in the hole			0
' fortunately , as the man was seen on camera by the rescue team , he managed to climb into the car park through the hole , and the lift can move again			2
mr @entity65 adds : ' he could have been cut in half , we had told them not to panic by shouting down from above and they completely ignored us			0
' the group of ten men and one woman had piled into the lift in the city of @entity10 , but exceeded the weight limit			0
after making a hole in the brick wall , one of the men tries to climb out , but he gets stuck halfway through - just as the lift is ready to move fortunately the man squeezes through and the lift can move up to the next floor and let passengers off the lifts automatic safety function kicked in and it automatically opened at the next floor to let people out			1
unfortunately for the 11 passengers in the lift , the next floor happened to be the basement where building managers had bricked the opening shut to stop unauthorised access to the property			0
building manager @entity114 , 43 , said : ' we wanted to make sure that only people who had come through the main entrance were allowed then to go to the property			0
' we did n't want them coming up from the underground car park			0
' he said they had thought it was easier to simply brick up the entrance rather than reprogramming the lift but had forgotten about the safety function that had delivered the unfortunate passengers to the car park where they faced the brick wall .			2
