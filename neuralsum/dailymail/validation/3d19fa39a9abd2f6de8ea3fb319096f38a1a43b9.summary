children who spend a lot of time playing video games do better at school , an international study has suggested			2
the @entity7 - based @entity6 said there was strong evidence that playing computer games on handheld consoles like @entity12 and @entity13 had ' positive effects on learning '			1
it said many games ' incorporate good learning principles ' and can ' hone problem - solving skills '			1
the @entity7 - based @entity6 said there was strong evidence that playing computer games had ' positive effects on learning ' girls are more likely to get higher marks at school because teachers like them more , an international report has found			1
teachers consistently give better results to girls even when they perform similarly in international tests , the @entity6 said			2
it suggests that teachers have a ' gender bias ' towards girls because they are well behaved and listen in class			0
' girls ' better marks may reflect the fact that they tend to be ' better students ' than boys : they tend to do what is required and expected of them , thanks to better self - regulation skills , and they are more driven to excel in school , ' the study says			0
but this may harm girls ' future career prospects , the @entity6 suggests , because bosses reward people based on what they can do rather than their school grades			2
students who play one - player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics , reading , science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games , the @entity6 said			1
but the evidence shows that playing computer games only helps children at school if they are not competing against other people over the internet			1
boys are much more likely than girls to play computer games – but often get caught up in shoot ' em ups and other online competitions against other players , the study said			1
this means that playing on the computer at home helps girls more than boys			0
the report said : ' the gender gap in video gaming translates into a performance advantage for girls			2
' however , it also warns that the ' addictive nature of gaming ' has its downsides			1
it said : ' students who play video games excessively might not be able to focus on their work at school , may be less willing to spend time on school work at home , might develop sleep problems , and might be less perseverant if there are no immediate rewards for their efforts , like those offered in gaming			1
' today 's shock research comes after @entity98 claimed video games were helping children become ' nicer , kinder and more well - balanced ' than their parents – and was even helping to cut crime			2
students who play one - player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics , reading , science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games the @entity110 mayor ridiculed claims mobile phones and handheld games consoles were turning youngsters into ' lidless lizards '			1
mr @entity98 said he understood people 's concerns when they saw their children ' bathed perpetually in the light of the screen gazing like lidless lizards at whatever depraved and corrupting material they can find '			0
but mr @entity98 said : ' i see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today			0
@entity98 has praised video games for making today 's teenagers more sociable than their parents ' in fact i would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer , kinder , more well - balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were			0
' the @entity110 mayor added : ' and when you consider the very steep falls in crime that we are seeing not just in @entity110 but across the developed world and when you consider that crime is overwhelmingly committed by young men you have to wonder whether there is a correlation - a link between the tech boom and the rise in civility			0
' what do they suffer from , the young men who are so foolish as to get sucked into crime ? anger , low self - esteem , a sense of social exclusion - a feeling that no one much cares about them			0
' and what do they get from these gizmos – endless opportunities for self - expression , communication - the myriad pipette drops of self - affirmation that come with the selfie and the text and the shared video			0
' today 's @entity6 's report also warns against the growing divide between girls and boys in science and maths			1
it blames gender stereotypes and girls ' lack of confidence for putting them off the core subjects			0
the report - using research from international tests in reading , maths and science to examine gender differences in education - argues that parents , teachers and employers all have ingrained ' biases ' that they are passing on to youngsters			1
across the 64 nations examined , women are much less likely to consider careers in science and maths - based subjects and to have the same self - confidence as boys in these areas			0
overall , less than one in 20 girls considers working in science , technology , engineering and maths , compared to one in five boys , despite the sexes achieving similar results in international science tests .			0
