doctors believe a £ 20 test will save many lives by identifying damage to heart cells that they would otherwise have missed a new £ 20 blood test doubles the chance of spotting hidden heart attacks in women			1
doctors believe it will save many lives by identifying damage to heart cells that they would otherwise have missed			2
existing checks are good at picking up cardiac trouble in men suffering chest pains , with a diagnosis rate of 19 per cent			1
however the rate for women is only 11 per cent			0
the new test , which is much more sensitive , produces a 22 per cent rate for both sexes			1
patients whose heart attacks are not detected are more likely to have further - potentially fatal - episodes because they are not given the correct treatment			0
developed by @entity31 firm @entity29 , the test measures levels of troponin , a protein produced by damaged heart cells			1
it detects extra cases in women both because it is more sensitive and because doctors have lowered the threshold for a positive reading in females			0
@entity43 , a @entity44 cardiologist who has studied the test , said : ‘ while similar numbers of men and women attend @entity50 with chest pains , we wanted to know why women are less likely to be diagnosed with a heart attack			1
‘ our findings suggest one reason for this difference in diagnosis rates for men and women is that we , as doctors , may have been using a threshold for troponin testing that is too high in women			2
whether using different thresholds for men and women will lead to more accurate diagnosis and improve outcomes is now being evaluated in a large clinical trial funded by the @entity68			0
’ dr @entity43 based his 22 per cent diagnostic rate on the cases of 1,000 men and women admitted to the @entity73 of @entity74 with chest pain			2
@entity76 , the @entity68 ’s medical director , said the new test took advantage of the fact that the danger level for troponin is lower in women than in men			2
the professor added : ‘ this research has shown that the results of the commonly used troponin blood test are significant at different levels in men and women			1
' when the researchers took this into account , they found that twice as many women would be diagnosed with a heart attack			1
developed by @entity31 firm @entity29 , the test measures levels of troponin , a protein produced by damaged heart cells ( file picture ) ‘ if these results are confirmed in the much larger clinical trial we ’re funding , they suggest that using a high - sensitivity troponin test , with a threshold specific to each gender , could save many more women ’s lives by identifying them earlier to take steps to prevent them dying or having another , bigger heart attack			1
’ high - sensitivity testing was approved by the @entity116 last year but this is the first evidence of the value of gender - specific tests			0
the price of the standard and the high - sensitivity test is the same : £ 20			2
diagnosis of a heart attack is usually based on symptoms backed up by tests			1
patients with chest pain may be given an electrocardiogram as well as blood tests to assess damage to the heart muscle			0
@entity132 , which are found inside heart cells , are released into the bloodstream when they become damaged by lack of blood supply to the heart			1
every year around 110,000 men and 65,000 women in the @entity141 are diagnosed with a heart attack three weeks ago , @entity143 , from @entity74 , collapsed at work with chest pain			1
the 41 - year - old was rushed to the @entity73 where she was diagnosed with a heart attack after being given the high - sensitive troponin blood test with the lower threshold for women			1
@entity143 said : ‘ i ’d been having chest pains for about a month			0
as a working mum , i put it down to stress			0
but last week , as i was walking into work , the pain got much worse and i collapsed , causing my colleagues to call an ambulance			0
‘ i felt a sense of reassurance when i got to the hospital			0
they took my blood and did other tests			0
they thought i ’d had a heart attack			2
' i was treated with a stent to save my life			0
i ’m so grateful that my heart attack was spotted and treated so well			0
’ every year around 110,000 men and 65,000 women in the @entity141 are diagnosed with a heart attack , and women are three times as likely to die from one than from breast cancer			1
the @entity74 research was reported in the @entity178 .			0

existing tests for cardiac trouble in women have diagnosis rate of only 11 **%**
but a new £ 20 blood test produces a 22 **%** rate for both sexes , *experts* say
@entity190 measures levels of troponin protein , produced by damaged heart cells
about 110,000 men and 65,000 women in @entity141 diagnosed with a heart attack each year
women are three times as likely to die from one than from breast cancer
