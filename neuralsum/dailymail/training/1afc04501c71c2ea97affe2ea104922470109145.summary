almost 25 years since the @entity0 came down , deer roaming the @entity4 - @entity3 border still balk at crossing areas where electric fences one lay			1
a study of the animals in the @entity10 national park , in the @entity4 , has discovered that red deer are avoiding the once perilous areas where three parallel electrified fences were patrolled by armed guards - despite the creatures having no living memory of it			1
nearly 500 people died trying to cross the barrier , which isolated the communist world from the @entity21			1
these red deer near @entity23 , @entity4 , still fear crossing the line where the @entity0 once stood a reconstruction of the electrified barbed - wire barrier stands in the nearby @entity27			1
but the original fence was taken down in 1991 - long before the current population of deer were born according to a seven - year study , the invisible border has become instilled in the population , and will be handed down generations			1
@entity35 , a biologist who led the project at @entity4 's @entity27 , said : ' it was fascinating to realize for the first time that anything like that is possible			2
' @entity41 , where the communists took power in 1948 , had three parallel electrified fences			0
many deer were victims of the barrier , which came down in 1991			2
' the border still plays a role for them and separates the two populations			0
' he said the research showed the animals stick to traditional life patterns , returning every year to the same places			0
' fawns follow mothers for the first year of their life and learn from them where to go			0
' biologists who conducted a seven - year study into the behaviour predict it will last for generations scientists conducting research on @entity3 territory reached similar conclusions			1
wildlife officials recorded the movement of some 300 @entity4 and @entity3 deer with @entity74 - equipped collars which sent data to computers			2
' i do n't think it 's a surprising result , ' said professor @entity79 of the @entity80 in @entity81 , who was not involved in the research			0
' these animals are really conservative			0

seven - year study found red deer on @entity4 - @entity3 border do not cross
electrified fence dividing @entity89 from communist world taken down in 1991
none of current deer population were alive when the barrier was up
@entity4 and @entity3 biologists predict behaviour will last for generations
