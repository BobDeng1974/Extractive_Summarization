but their joy soon turns to absolute terror as two masked and bloodied men emerge from behind a photo booth curtain , shouting and screaming at the pair			1
the couple suddenly become wide - eyed , with looks of absolute horror on their faces			0
cameras capture the couple 's reaction prank : the girl screams in terror as the masked men shout at the pair thankfully , however , they were in no real danger			1
they were the victims of a prank by an @entity18 tv station which targeted members of the public trying to get their pictures taken in a photobooth			1
as reported by @entity43 , the innocent victims are filmed from inside the booth as they enter it to have their pictures taken			2
as they begin to pose for the camera , the two masked men appear either side of the booth			2
posing : these two girls happily posed for the photograph , completely unaware of what was about to happen horror : but after the two men appear , their expressions completely change worried : they are pictured banging on the wire fence as the masked men shout at them joke : this is the photobooth which the pranksters used for their stunt gory : this image shows one of the pranksters in a blood - stained t - shirt in some cases , they can be heard screaming ' do you want to die '			1
they also prevent the occupants from escaping by placing a wire fence around it			0
understandably , the booth 's occupants react with absolute terror - with many jumping up and down and screaming			1
and the moment is captured on camera , showing how people react at a moment of absolute terror			0
innocent : this man entered the booth on his own , thinking he was about to have a photo taken terrified : but as the masked men appear , he jumps from his seat in terror			1
the pranksters block the occupant from escaping by placing a chain fence around the booth stunt : this picture shows how the men either side of the booth surrounded it with the fence			2
they even had what appear to be blood stains on their tops perhaps the best example from the prank shows a young man and his friend inside the booth			0
as the two men approach from either side , the man is completely overwhelmed with fear			0
his female friend quickly realises it is a prank , however , the boy jumps up and down screaming in fear of his life , completely unable to calm down for some time			0
good mood : these friends entered the booth happily , looking forward to having their picture taken hilarious : when the masked men appear , the young girl quickly seems to realise it is a prank			1
the boy , however , reacts rather differently funny : as the men push against the wire fence , the youngster jumps up and down , screaming hysterically upset : at one point , the boy is completely inconsolable			0
