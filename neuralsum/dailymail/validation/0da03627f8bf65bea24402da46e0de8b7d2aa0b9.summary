@entity0 and @entity1 will have the chance to impose themselves on @entity4 as @entity6 bid for a fifth @entity8 final victory - and the two openers are hoping they have saved their best for last			1
@entity0 and @entity12 's destructive partnership has only intermittently fired over the past six weeks as @entity6 have nonetheless booked their place in sunday 's @entity15 final against their fellow tournament co-hosts			1
@entity12 , who will have home comforts on the famously huge playing area , made only his second half - century of the campaign in @entity6 's semi-final win over @entity21 in @entity22			1
@entity0 thank the crowd after winning the semi final against @entity21 but it was at the @entity15 where he smashed hapless @entity26 for 135 on @entity27 , and he returns in good heart after his hard - earned 81 against the defending champions on thursday			1
' it was n't my most fluid innings but it was nice to get through that , ' he said			2
' i was under the pump - i had n't scored any runs for a while			2
' i felt like i was playing really well			2
it 's just one of those things - it did n't translate into a hell of a lot of runs lately			2
' but i hope i 'm past that and there 's some more runs to come			1
' @entity0 has had one feast - a career - best 178 against @entity48 in @entity49 - and , by his standards , some famine in the @entity8 so far			1
@entity1 will hope to make an impact for @entity6 in the @entity8 final like @entity12 , playing in the tournament for the first time , he told @entity6 's @entity56 : ' it 's just those easy ' outs ' that are causing a bit of a stir in my mind			1
' @entity0 was caught from a leading edge into the ring field against @entity21 , and added : ' it 's not great to have big edges ( on your bat ) sometimes			1
' but every time i 've come in i 've looked a million dollars , i 've hit every ball in the middle and i 've just got to find a way to get past that ( first ) 10 overs , be clinical and bat deep			2
' the @entity75 need to get their minds right too , of course , to upset the odds			0
they are being portrayed as outsiders but remain the only unbeaten team in the tournament and scored a narrow victory over @entity6 in an epic , low - scoring group match in @entity85 at the end of last month			1
@entity87 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity21 's @entity89 on their way to the @entity8 final @entity6 celebrate their win over @entity21 in the @entity8 semi-final much has been made of @entity6 's home advantage for the rematch , but @entity4 insist they are not fazed			1
@entity99 @entity98 was not supposed to be involved at all until injury intervened for @entity101			0
@entity98 was brought into the squad as a replacement and acquitted himself well for economical figures in tuesday 's semi-final win over @entity106			2
he said : ' this is definitely something i will never forget			0
' as a kid , you grow up pretending to be these [ cricket ] heroes , like playing with my brother out the back and going through scenarios like running in to bowl at a @entity8 final			1
' you have to pinch yourself			0
' i 've been presented with an opportunity which i 'm very grateful for and excited about			0
' fellow seamer @entity119 will take the new ball alongside @entity121 , and is confident - whatever the conditions			0
' we 're not too worried about the size of the ground , ' said @entity119			0
' it 's a dream come true for all the guys			0
as a kid growing up , you either want to be an @entity130 or a @entity4			1
' this is as good as it gets , taking on @entity6 in @entity133 on one of the best cricket grounds in the world			1
' swing is the forte for @entity119 and @entity138 , but attuning to the sell - out atmosphere will be the starting point			0
' there 's going to be a lot of people			0
it 's going to be loud , ' said @entity119			0
' there will be close to 100,000 people screaming			0
' it will be interesting to see what it 's like here			0
' @entity151 's visitors , like @entity153 's hosts , appear set to name an unchanged team with veteran left - arm orthodox @entity155 expected to be fit after all .			0

@entity6 are bidding to win their fifth @entity8 final on sunday
co-hosts @entity4 stand in their way of @entity8 *glory*
