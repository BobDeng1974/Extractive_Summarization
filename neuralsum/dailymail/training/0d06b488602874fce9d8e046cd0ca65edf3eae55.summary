by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 over the next couple of weeks , and especially when @entity4 play @entity5 in @entity6 on june 24 , you will hear a lot about a game played in the same city which is seen as the biggest @entity11 shock of all time – @entity13 1 - 0 @entity4 in 1950			1
in particular you will hear the name @entity15			1
i spent a lot of time researching this particular game for my book ‘ is he all that ? ’ and concluded that while the @entity22 let the national team down , it ’s a result that should never have stood			0
the circumstances of the game render it meaningless in my view and in no way should the result be regarded as the biggest upset in football history			0
disaster : @entity4 goalkeeper @entity32 looks on helplessly as he is beaten by @entity15 horror : sir @entity33 ( right ) played as @entity4 suffered an embarrassing 1 - 0 defeat at the hands of the @entity36 firstly let ’s assess the @entity4 team at that time – they were brilliant			1
in 1948 they went to @entity41 and won 4 - 0 in @entity42 against the double world champions			0
it was so easy that @entity45 stood in the corner with the ball at his feet and combed his hair with his hands as he waited for the well - beaten @entity41 to challenge him			0
but in @entity53 two years later , the pomposity of the @entity22 at that time was so out of control they decided to send @entity45 – comfortably @entity4 ’s best player – to an exhibition tour of @entity57 rather than take him to the @entity11			1
so @entity45 sailed to @entity58 for the first ‘ showpiece ’ game , then took the train to @entity62 for the second match , but he was injured			0
the @entity64 beat a @entity36 national team 1 - 0 , an ironic contrast to what would happen later in @entity6			1
he then flew to @entity53 via @entity68			2
having missed @entity4 ’s first ever @entity11 match - they beat @entity70 2 - 0 - @entity45 then sat in the stands in @entity6 to watch the @entity36 defeat			1
the @entity74 fishmonger @entity73 picked the team in his role as @entity22 selector ( he would later become a @entity79 president )			0
seemingly the main thing the @entity4 manager @entity80 did at the @entity11 was don an apron and teach the chefs at the @entity84 in @entity85 how to fry eggs after they had served up a black and burnt mess on a plate to the players			2
but the @entity22 ’s buffoonery was not the reason this result was a joke			0
three of the victorious players did not have @entity36 citizenship , including the goalscorer @entity97			1
@entity79 allowed them to play on the promise that they would all get citizenship after the tournament			0
however , the @entity36 captain that day @entity103 failed to ever become a @entity13 citizen			1
to make it worse for @entity4 , he was @entity106			1
as a bizarre aside , @entity106 qualified but refused to go to this @entity11 because they had failed to win the @entity107 after a fortunate @entity4 win at @entity109			1
these ‘ ringers ’ were brought in when the @entity13 realised they had a team that was likely to be humiliated at the @entity11			1
in 1948 , when @entity4 went to @entity41 and won 4 - 0 , the @entity36 had lost to the @entity41 9 - 0			1
they had actually been semi-finalists in 1930 and wanted to protect that proud history - not be remembered for embarrassing results			0
so they hunted for good players whether they were @entity13 or not			2
he was found washing pots and studying in @entity117 , and he only met his @entity11 team - mates two days before they travelled to the tournament			0
the goal itself was a joke : @entity123 hit an awful shot - some thought it was a cross – which was one of only two efforts they had in the 90 minutes , and according to most accounts of the game i ’ve read , it hit the oblivious @entity15 on the back of the head and went in			2
@entity33 played in the game and said : ‘ he ( @entity15 ) ducked to avoid the ball			2
’ three - and - a - half years after scoring that goal @entity15 played in a @entity11 qualifier for the country of his birth @entity115			2
so much for being an @entity13 citizen			2
lofted up high : @entity15 is carried off the pitch in celebration but was n't even an @entity13 citizen sorry , you are ? @entity13 skipper @entity103 ( right ) was @entity106 and exchanged pleasantries with @entity146 battler : @entity149 midfielder @entity148 ( centre ) goes up for a header between @entity13 defenders @entity152 and @entity123 ball in hand : @entity32 and @entity33 tried to get @entity4 going but failed in @entity6 confidence : @entity33 and other members of the @entity4 team get fitted for their suits ahead of their flight to @entity85 it was a crazy result , and it is wheeled out as some sort of symbol of @entity149 uselessness when there are far better examples of that from @entity11 history ; the whole 2010 campaign under @entity170 springs to mind			1
it was a lucky win for the @entity36 - their goalkeeper @entity171 literally never kicked a ball in the game , because he was useless with his feet ; @entity4 hit the bar at least five times			1
it was a watershed for the @entity22 ’s superior attitude ( this was the first @entity11 they bothered to enter ) and the @entity36 team had a few ringers			2
even though i believe the result should n’t have stood , and by fielding @entity185 citizens i believe the @entity13 cheated , i am glad that @entity15 is seen as the hero			1
his life ended in tragedy			0
his family were members of the @entity115 aristocracy , and when the dictator @entity193 tightened his grip on the country , his vicious army , the @entity189 , snatched @entity15 as he started a day ’s work at the dry - cleaning business he owned			0
he was taken to @entity198 , the notorious prison where inmates were tortured - sometimes sexually - and murdered			0
it is widely believed that ‘ men were sent there to die ’			0
it was a torture and death chamber , where 40 men were crowded into rooms measuring just a few square feet			0
they ate gruel off the floor , and they drank only the water they were hosed down with			0
one @entity13 journalist said this : ‘ most men do not leave @entity198 ; if they are not beaten to death they die of tuberculosis , dysentery , or having the blood sucked from them by scores of vermin			0
’ his relatives never heard from him again			0
it is believed he is one of the 30,000 or more executed by @entity193 so hail @entity15 as a hero , but bear in mind the context and circumstances of that @entity36 victory over @entity4 in @entity6 in 1950			1
watching on : local @entity53 girls watch the @entity4 team train prior to their opening match against @entity70			1

@entity4 travelled to @entity53 1950 as one of the *favourites* for the trophy
but they were humiliated by the @entity36 , who were rank *outsiders*
goalscorer @entity15 was n't @entity13 and captain @entity103 was @entity106
