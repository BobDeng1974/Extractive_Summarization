these stunning photographs show a @entity2 waterfall that has partially frozen mid-flow			1
the @entity4 , or @entity5 , has attracted thousands of tourists who marvel at the overspilling ice which formed after temperatures plummeted in @entity10			1
the width of the waterfall changes with the fluctuating temperatures and rainfall			2
but it is usually nearly 100ft wide , increasing to more than 160ft during flood season			0
during the deep winter it can be reduced to a fraction of that scale			0
a frigid autumn , a season in which the mercury rarely rises above freezing , has tamed the usually roaring rapids of the largest waterfall on @entity2 's @entity46 , and changed the landscape into a real winter wonderland			1
the river originates in the @entity50 and @entity51 and empties into the @entity53 drain into the @entity54			0
the scene near the waterfall is a real winter wonderland , where plummeting temperatures have seen large sections freeze over the frozen waterfall looks almost like a series of fluffy clouds , and presents a spectacular addition to the landscape by the time the water reaches the @entity4 , it has collected tonnes of fine - grained loess , a mineral - rich silt that has been deposited on land after being carried by the wind			1
the tiny particles are continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel , causing natural dams to slowly accrue			0
these subaqueous dams , which are unpredictable and generally undetectable , eventually burst , releasing enormous rushes of water which course along new flood planes to the sea .			2
