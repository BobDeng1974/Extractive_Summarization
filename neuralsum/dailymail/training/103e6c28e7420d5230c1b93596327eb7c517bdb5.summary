by @entity2 - @entity1 's son and manager published : 18:06 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 17 may 2013 going out on the @entity5 stage and performing your song in front of 200 million viewers — and knowing your country is pinning its hopes on you — is nerve - racking enough			1
but , as @entity14 will undoubtedly discover tomorrow night when she represents the @entity15 in the world ’s biggest song contest , that ’s nothing compared to what happens after you ’ve sung and you wait for the votes to come in			1
if you have three hours to kill , as my father @entity1 had last year , after being first on — waiting while the other 25 contestants sang , then waiting for the votes to come in — then it can be the longest night of your life			1
i was at his side that night and for the exhilarating week we spent preparing for the show in @entity29 , capital of the host country , @entity31			1
@entity1 ( left ) came second to last with his 2012 @entity5 entry ' @entity33 '			1
he said he thinks @entity14 ( right ) can go all the way in the competition this year he ’d been mobbed by fans and given a police motorcycle escort			1
his odds narrowed from 10 - 1 to 2 - 1 second favourite			1
he ’d already sung his ballad , @entity33 , on tv and radio shows in @entity15 and @entity42 , and the feedback had been encouraging			1
even though he ’s been performing for more than 50 years , @entity45 still gets nervous before every show , and that night was no exception			1
he wo n’t allow whistling in his dressing room and he wore a pendant given to him by @entity50 — he calls it his @entity52 ( taking care of business ) necklace — for luck			1
going on first did n’t augur well , according to some seasoned @entity5 experts			2
as commentator @entity58 observed this week : ‘ everyone has forgotten you by the time it comes to vote			2
if @entity1 had gone on later , maybe he would have done better			1
’ but we were @entity5 virgins			0
we ’d hoped starting the show would give us an advantage			0
because of the time difference between @entity29 and the rest of @entity42 , the show was n’t starting until midnight			0
@entity45 would still feel fresh			0
a later slot might have taken its toll on him through @entity69 was our theory , anyway			0
he went on , sang his song and got a standing ovation			0
so far , so brilliant			0
then we went to the @entity73 to sip champagne and watch the rest of the show , while receiving congratulatory texts from friends and family all over the world			1
@entity45 , as usual , had more stamina than the rest of us , and he stayed on his feet for the rest of the show			0
he remained cheerful and positive — even when the bread - baking @entity85 grannies came on and it was clear they were going to make a big impact			1
they ’d get the sympathy vote , but he hoped the points would go to the best song , not the most striking production or staging			0
we would only have had cause to worry if it had been the @entity97 - making @entity96 ! when voting began , we waited expectantly for points to come our way , but there was an ominous silence			2
after the first three countries , @entity45 turned to me and said : ‘ have n’t i got any votes yet ? ’ i ’m not just his loving son ; i ’m his dutiful manager , too : it ’s my job to keep things upbeat			1
‘ no , but do n’t worry because there are still many other countries to vote , ’ i told him			0
after eight countries we still had n’t made our mark on the @entity5 scoreboard — it was clear we were in trouble			0
by the time all the results were in , @entity45 , who had stoically kept his cool , finished second from last — just ahead of @entity119 — with only 12 votes in total			2
i gave it my best shot , and i hope no one in the @entity15 feels i let them down , ’ he said			1
‘ the voting was out of my hands			0
’ with his head held high , gracious in defeat , he did the rounds backstage , congratulating the winner , @entity134 ’s @entity133 , who sang @entity136 ; the @entity137 , who came second with party for everyone ; and every participant on their performance			2
back at the hotel , @entity45 changed out of his tux into jeans and a t - shirt , and — for a man who had just had a major disappointment — he was totally relaxed , though still worrying that people might feel he had n’t done his best			1
there were plenty of laughs , but no recriminations , no what - ifs , no buck - passing			2
@entity45 was still as proud at being asked to represent the @entity15 as he had been three months earlier , when i told him the @entity157 wanted him to do it			1
‘ i ’ve got no regrets , ’ he told me that night after the show			2
‘ i ’d do it all over again if i was asked			0
’ we did n’t get to bed until 6am , and after a few hours ’ sleep we went to a great barbecue on the beach , organised by the @entity157			2
wine flowed , there was lots more laughter and @entity45 even sang songs karaoke - style			1
everyone agreed there was no better voice around			0
when we flew home , the airport was full of well - wishers — they seemed more upset than @entity45 by the result			2
he ’d given it his all			0
after all , we consoled ourselves , it was a song contest , not a general election			0
@entity45 has since recorded a cd of duets with @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , and he has performed in 60 countries around the world			0
not once has he looked back — his motto is ‘ onwards and upwards ’			0
now he ’s sent a letter of good wishes to @entity196 : we ’ve got our fingers crossed for her			0
and @entity45 hopes there is n’t a bunch of bread - baking @entity85 grannies to ‘ totally eclipse ’ her .			2
