by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:51 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 16:01 est , 22 january 2014 @entity3 , the overnight @entity5 success story whose hardscrabble roots and @entity8 - sized abortion rights filibuster made her a household name in june 2013 , is in a sudden downward spiral			1
a day after the @entity12 published a profile of the 50 - year - old state senator and gubernatorial candidate that found problems with her public biography , @entity11 began lashing out at her @entity20 opponent , state attorney general @entity19 , complaining that he had never ' walked a day in my shoes			1
' @entity19 is a paraplegic , confined to a wheelchair from the age of 26 after a tree fell on him during a long - distance jog			1
in her defense , @entity28 , a progressive group that promotes female @entity5 candidates , blasted the handicapped @entity19 for ' running scared			1
' and @entity11 herself tweeted on tuesday that ' the only thing @entity19 & his allies have proven with these desperate attacks is that they do n’t understand these @entity8 stories of struggle			1
' @entity5 candidate for @entity8 governor @entity3 is struggling to explain misstatements in her own biography , and resorted to attacking her opponent , a paraplegic , for never having ' walked a day in my shoes ' @entity8 attorney general @entity46 , @entity20 candidate for @entity8 governor , lost the use of his legs at age 26 in a freak accident , when an oak tree fell on his back as he jogged by ' we ’re not surprised by @entity46 ’s campaign attacks on the personal story of my life as a single mother who worked hard to get ahead , ' @entity11 said in a statement after the @entity62 newspaper published its exploration of her life story			1
' i am proud of where i came from , ' she said , ' and i am proud of what i ’ve been able to achieve through hard work and perseverance			0
and i guarantee you that anyone who tries to say otherwise has n’t walked a day in my shoes			1
' @entity71 , the reporter who started the news cycle with a deep - dive into @entity11 ' life story , insists that he never spoke to @entity19 or his campaign staff for his story			1
@entity71 is regarded as a liberal partisan , and wrote an unflattering 2003 book - length critique of then - president @entity78 and his deputy chief of staff @entity79			2
@entity8 gov. @entity81 is no stranger to public gaffes			2
he will vacate the governor 's mansion after the 2014 election			1
@entity81 surprised abortion - rights defenders when he trumped @entity11 ' filibuster by extending the state 's legislative calendar long enough to pass the bill she opposed @entity11 , who rocketed to stardom in pink sneakers that sustained her through an 11 - hour filibuster aimed at killing new restrictions on abortion clinics , is n't backing down from new punchlines that @entity71 has provided her @entity20 rivals			1
while she has styled herself as a self - made single mother who put herself through @entity103 , @entity71 found that her older husband @entity104 paid most of the bills , including footing her last two years at @entity106 and then her law school tuition			2
he cashed in his 401 ( k ) retirement account and borrowed still more money to cover his wife 's educational bills			0
ultimately their marriage soured , and conservative pundits are finding the timing noteworthy since @entity11 recalled that his ex-wife left him right after he made the final payment on her student loans			2
' it was ironic , he told the @entity12			0
' i made the last payment , and it was the next day she left			0
' @entity71 also found fault with the life timeline @entity3 has promoted for herself , learning that she became a single mother later in life than she has claimed and did n't struggle financially while she completed her education			2
she was 21 – not 19 as her online @entity129 biography claims – when she divorced her first husband			0
she lived in a mobile home with her daughter @entity132 , but only for a few months , it turns out			0
and life became much easier when she married again just a few years later			0
@entity104 's income as a lawyer helped with expenses raising @entity132 and @entity138 , another daughter the couple had together			0
he ended up with custody of both daughters , casting more doubt on @entity3 ' narrative as a professional woman who successfully raised two children			2
she has made these questions fair game herself , @entity71 wrote , because she ' has made her personal story of struggle and success a centerpiece of her campaign ' for governor			1
and ' some facts have been blurred			0
' the shoes : @entity11 ' pink running sneakers made her an overnight feminist icon after she stood for 11 hours straight in opposition to a bill -- which eventually became law -- tightening requirements for abortion providers the shoes : @entity11 ' pink running sneakers made her an overnight feminist icon after she stood for 11 hours straight in opposition to a bill -- which eventually became law -- tightening requirements for abortion providers @entity11 acknowledged to the @entity62 newspaper that her ' language should be tighter ' when telling her life story			1
she admitted that she was now ' learning about ' the dangers of ' using broader , looser language			0
i need to be more focused on the detail			0
' although @entity19 's campaign did n't contribute to @entity71 's story , it came out swinging after it hit newsstands			1
@entity181 , the @entity19 campaign 's communications director , said in a statement that @entity11 is ' trying to hide her past			1
' ' sen. @entity3 systematically , intentionally and repeatedly deceived @entity186 for years about her background , yet she expects voters to indulge her fanciful narrative , ' @entity181 claimed			2
' if voters ca n't trust what sen. @entity11 says , how can they trust her to lead ? ' the conservative punditry website @entity193 snarked that ' a guy who ’s spent nearly 30 years in a wheelchair can relate to struggle , but it ’s telling that @entity196 still thinks they can win a " my life sucked even harder than yours " debate with someone like him			1
' ' sure , he was crippled and needed spinal surgery and extensive rehabilitation and overcame it all to become attorney general of @entity8 , but what hardship is that compared to a woman overcoming young motherhood to attend @entity103 ? ' @entity3 's army : opponents of the right - to - life movement have stood behind @entity11 , putting millions into her coffers in hope of making her governor @entity19 , the @entity20 nominee for governor , has n't spoken publicly about the ' walk a day in my shoes ' slight , but the @entity12 profile 's author insists his story was n't a politically generated hit piece @entity11 faces an uphill climb in her unlikely battle to become the first @entity5 statewide office - holder in @entity8 since @entity225 lost the governor 's mansion to @entity78 in 1994			1
her campaign collected $ 12.2 million last year and had $ 9.5 million banked as of last week			0
but @entity19 has a war chest of $ 27 million amassed for the battle			2
@entity11 has fired back , using the episode as a chance to build her email list and raise still more money			0
' mine is a story about a teenage single mother who struggled to keep her young family afloat , ' she wrote online tuesday			0
' it ’s a story about a young woman who was given a precious opportunity to work her way up in the world			0
it ’s a story about resiliency , and sacrifice , and perseverance			0
' ' and you ’re damn right it ’s a true story			0

@entity3 is becoming a punchline for using ' walk a day in my shoes ' line against @entity46 , the wheelchair - bound attorney general of @entity8
@entity19 and @entity11 will square off for the governor 's job in *november*
*derided* by conservatives as ' @entity261 , ' @entity11 came to national *prominence* with an 11 - hour filibuster to block a law restricting abortions
now a @entity62 newspaper has published a profile of her questioning several parts of the hardscrabble - roots story that formed her political identity
*mistakenly* thinking @entity19 's campaign was behind the story , @entity11 lashed out – and may come to regret her choice of words
a liberal *advocacy* group that promotes female candidates piled on the gaffe - wagon , saying that @entity19 ' is running scared . '
