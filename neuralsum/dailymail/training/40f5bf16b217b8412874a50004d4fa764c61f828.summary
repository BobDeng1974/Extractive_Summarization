@entity1 forward @entity0 has cut short his injury - hit stint in the @entity3 to rejoin @entity4			1
the 25 - year - old prop left the @entity4 after their @entity7 win over @entity8 12 months ago and joined @entity9 on a two - year contract , with an option for a third season with the @entity14 club			1
however , he was sidelined for the first three months of the season with a shoulder injury and missed the end of it after undergoing surgery on the problem for a second time			0
@entity0 ( pictured winning the @entity23 final in 2013 ) has re-signed for @entity4 now he is back with the @entity4 , having signed a three - year deal , with the option of a fourth in the club 's favour , although chairman @entity29 says they have inserted a clause in his contract in case the player fails to make a full recovery from his latest operation			1
@entity0 , who becomes the second @entity1 international to rejoin @entity4 in the last six months following @entity39 ' return from rugby union , said : ' i have enjoyed my time with @entity9 but i felt it was the right time to return to the @entity43			1
' @entity4 was always going to be my first choice and i am really happy that we have been able to agree a deal			2
' i owe a lot to this club having come through the youth system			0
the squad is a bit younger now and i hope to be able to pass on my experience to some of the other players			0
i was at the @entity7 last month cheering the boys on and hope to be back there again next season			0
' @entity0 , who made 111 appearances in his first spell with the club , was wanted by @entity61 , who are looking to bolster their front row after releasing @entity64 and @entity65 in recent weeks , but @entity4 had first option on him			1
they will need to release players to make room for @entity0 under their salary cap and it is thought @entity72 and possibly @entity73 could now be moved on			2
@entity4 coach @entity74 said : ' as soon as i heard that he might be available , i asked ( rugby manager ) @entity76 and @entity29 to see if it was possible and i am grateful that they have done just that			2
' i am pleased also for @entity0 showing loyalty to the club			2
having seen the fans welcome @entity39 back earlier this year , i am looking forward to seeing them give @entity0 a great reception at the @entity85 next season			1
' @entity86 ( pictured celebrating the @entity88 win in october ) is pleased that @entity0 is back at the club @entity4 say @entity0 will miss the start of the new season but is expected to recover from his latest shoulder operation in time to make his return in late february			1
@entity29 said : ' we are aware that @entity0 has had issues with his shoulders in the past which did not resolve with keyhole surgery but he has now had advanced surgery to put them right and our medical specialist advise that statistics have proven the surgery to work in 97 per cent of shoulder cases			0
' as is the case in instances like this , we have put provisions in @entity0 's contract to protect the club against recurrence			0
' we all know that a fit @entity0 is one of the best front rowers in the game and i have confidence in my coaching staff to bring the best out of him again and , hopefully , even more with his shoulder problems fixed			0
' @entity0 had a lot of interest from rival clubs but preferred to be back at @entity4			1
' this is another positive for @entity4 and for rugby league in this country and serves only to vindicate our policy of allowing players to play in other competitions whilst keeping the option available for them to return to the club in the future			0
' with this deal , there will now be a few consequential changes to our squad for the 2015 season to follow			0

@entity0 will enjoy a second spell at @entity4
but the forward will miss the start of the @entity88 season
coach @entity86 is delighted that @entity0 has re-signed
