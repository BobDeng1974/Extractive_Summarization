by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 13:09 est , 9 october 2012 @entity1 – one of the most popular shows on tv – is coming to pc , bringing with him the wondrous fantasy world fans know and love			0
thankfully , @entity10 - winning @entity9 studios are behind the project , and have developed a game that places a strong emphasis on cooperative , pick - up - and - play gameplay			1
pretty : the visuals stay true to the series but have a cartoon - like feel about them @entity1 : @entity19 is free to play on @entity20 , and combines authentic style with striking visuals			1
players can embark on a magical adventure with friends to battle against the evil forces that threaten @entity28			0
we talked to @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , on what fans can expect from the game : take us through @entity1			0
@entity32 : ' we wanted to create a fantasy game for quite some time and it made sense to work with a very good like brand like @entity1			0
' we asked ourselves how we can make a game that is an authentic extension of the show and not an exploitation of the brand			2
' the show is about three things : heroism , fighting off evil creatures and comradery , this being the relationship between @entity50 and @entity1 , or @entity50 and @entity51			0
have you brought characters over from the universe itself , or have you created your own characters ? @entity32 : ' both , we call it @entity58 it takes place in the same universe at @entity61 and therefore you ’re going to meet all those characters			2
' you get quests from @entity1 , @entity50 and @entity64 and interact with them throughout the game			0
' adventure for all : the game is free and can be played at any time on @entity20 what made you want to make this game free to play ? @entity32 : ' we decided a game based on this ip has to meaningfully expand upon it and it can not be just exploitation			1
' the reason we decide to go for a model where you do n’t pay upfront is firstly because we believe the game is good enough to be able to work as a freemium model and secondly because everyone and anyone who wants to try it can play the game			2
' that ’s why the game is on @entity20 - we wanted to make sure we opened up this game to as many people as we can			1
' the visuals speak for themselves , this quite a unique looking game , not something you ’re going to find on the market			0
you ’re not going to find any other game on the platform like this			0
' character customisation is a huge part of this			1
how have you managed to tailor that kind of freedom without it jarring the game universe ? @entity32 : ' because we wanted to make an accessible game we decided we wo n’t have classes , so it ’s not like traditional games where you choose your class and you ’re stuck with it			2
' i did n’t want anyone to feel they ca n’t change their mind and be penalised for their starting choice			0
' work together : you can work through the adventures with any of your friends tell us about cooperative play			1
@entity32 : ' we wanted to combine the good elements of a role - playing game but at the same time is simple enough so somebody who ’s new can instantly pick - up the game			2
we ’ve made a very intuitive control system			0
' what about the game ’s soundtrack ? @entity32 : ' all of our sound effects and music from the game are made by the same people who the music and the soundtrack of the tv show			1
' so , the music is based on what you ’ve heard on the tv show and the sound effects , too			1
when you hear two swords clashing together in the game it ’s actually the same one as the show			0
' any plans for mobile gaming ? @entity153 : ' not at this point , the first release of the game will be on @entity20 only but we are considering a touch version			1
' for more information see : @entity158 follow @entity0 on @entity159 : @ @entity160 and on @entity20 : @entity161 .			1
