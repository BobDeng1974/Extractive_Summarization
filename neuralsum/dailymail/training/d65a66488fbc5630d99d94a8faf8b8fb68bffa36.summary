this is the moment a @entity2 man was exonerated of a murder he did n't commit - 40 years after the killing took place			1
@entity6 was just 17 years old when he was sentenced to death in 1975 after businessman @entity8 was beaten and shot dead outside a convenience store in his neighborhood			1
then going under the name @entity12 , he was jailed alongside his brother @entity13 , then aged 20 , and their friend @entity14 , 19			1
but the case against them unraveled after the prosecution 's star witness , a 13 - year - old , recounted his testimony last year , saying he lied after being pressured and fed evidence by detectives			1
mr @entity14 had served 39 years , the longest ever for a man who was subsequently exonerated			1
mr @entity6 had been released on parole in 2003 after 27 years , and his exoneration yesterday brings to a close a case which the county prosecutor branded ' a terrible injustice			1
' in emotional scenes inside the @entity2 courtroom , mr @entity6 broke down in tears and pumped his fists before judge @entity30 stepped down from the bench to give him a hug			1
comforted by his attorney @entity57 , mr @entity6 told the court that ' this room is lit with the truth			1
' the tragic case began in spring 1975 outside a cut - rate store in @entity63			2
@entity8 , a money - order collector , had just come out of the shop when he was attacked			2
the assailants threw acid in his face , robbed him , beat him , and then used a gun to execute him			0
a green car screeched up to the curb before the attackers jumped in and were driven away			0
officers began their investigations and arrested several suspects , but none of them were correctly picked out during identity parades			0
witness @entity78 , who was aged 12 at the time of the murder of mr @entity8 ( pictured ) , told police he had seen the killings and gave the names of mr @entity6 , mr @entity12 and mr @entity14 however , last year mr @entity78 recounted his testimony , saying he had lied about being at the scene , and had been fed details and threatened by detectives while testifying officers then put out appeals for information and @entity78 , who was aged just 12 at the time , stepped forward saying he had witnessed the crime and knew who the perpetrators were			1
he later told @entity96 magazine : ' i do n't exactly know why i went up to the police at first			0
i think i just wanted to be helpful			0
' you have to understand i was 12 years old at the time			2
i thought i was doing the right thing			0
' in fact , @entity102 had not witnessed the crime , but had been heading home on a school bus in another part of the neighbourhood when he and his friends heard gunshots			0
they raced to the scene in time to see mr @entity8 dying on the pavement , but saw nothing more than that			2
when the case came to court , however , @entity78 was able to testify to having seen the @entity12 brothers and mr @entity14 at the scene of the crime			1
he gave details of the weapon used , the method of execution and the getaway vehicle - but these had all been fed to him by detectives , along with threats to arrest his parents for perjury if he tried to back away from the story , he said later			0
he testified three times at the separate trials - each testimony riddled with inconsistencies that failed to stack up with the others			2
@entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 were 20 and 19 when they were jailed			1
they were released last month aged 60 and 59			0
mr @entity14 served 39 years , the longest ever for a man subsequently exonerated the county prosecutor 's office has said it will not oppose compensation claims by the men , opening up the possibility of a joint payout of $ 4.1million ( pictured , the moment mr @entity14 was told he could walk free ) after spending the majority of their adult lives in jail , brothers @entity6 and @entity13 share a hug outside court as the charges against them are dropped but it was enough to convince three separate juries that the men were guilty , and they were sentenced to the death penalty , which was later lowered to life in prison			1
it was not until april 2013 , following a series of arrests for drug offences and a bout of poor health which landed him in hospital , that mr @entity78 tearfully confessed to his pastor that his evidence had been a lie			2
he later gave a written statement to officials from the @entity174 who passed it to the courts , leading to the three men having their names cleared			0
following the verdicts , county prosecutor @entity179 said his office will not oppose any claims of innocence , clearing the way for huge compensation claims by the victims			0
the trio could potentially claim $ 4.1million between them for a lifetime spent behind bars under @entity192 law that allows those wrongly incarcerated to claim $ 40,000 for each year in jail			2
the prosecutor 's concession seemed to astonish longtime @entity2 civil rights and defense attorney @entity57 , who represented mr @entity6 and his brother			1
he said : ' to recognize an injustice ... it gives me faith and hope in this criminal justice system that good things can come out of it from time to time			0
' since being released in 2003 , mr @entity6 , now 57 , has rebuilt his life			1
he is married to a woman he met in downtown @entity2 in 2003 when she could n't find the right bus and he rode with her to her destination			0
they married the next year after she proposed to him			0
mr @entity6 has called wife lashawn his best friend and greatest supporter			1
in this photo mr @entity6 teaches his brother how to use a smartphone			1
the last time the brothers were together as free men , the cordless phone had not even been invented yet brothers @entity6 and @entity13 embrace after mr @entity6 was exonerated of the murder of @entity8 , bringing to an end a 40 - year case that was described by prosecutors as ' a terrible injustice ' since being released in 2003 , mr @entity6 has rebuilt his life and is now married to @entity227 ( right ) , who he met on the bus			1
he has called her his best friend and greatest supporter he added : ' it 's my hope going forward that we do n't have to wait another 40 years for the next @entity6 , @entity13 , @entity14			1
' it 's my hope from this day on we can stop ignoring what is obvious in the criminal justice system and move forward with peace and love			0
' after the hearing , @entity6 credited @entity240 , a writer for @entity241 , who in 2011 dug into the men 's stories and exposed how justice had been subverted			2
@entity6 said he hoped one day to meet with @entity78 , who is now 52 , so he can tell him he understands what happened and has no ill will toward him			1
@entity6 said his exoneration finally makes him feel free to go anywhere he wants , anytime he 'd like			2
' i can even go back to being @entity12 , but i 'm not , ' he said			0
they killed everything he believed in , everything he ever wanted			0
' i wanted to be something , too			0
i could have been a lawyer possibly			0
i could have been @entity256			0

@entity6 was 17 when he was jailed for 1975 killing of @entity8
given death , reduced to life , with brother @entity13 and friend @entity14
prosecution 's case rested on testimony of 13 - year - old boy @entity78
