by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 5 march 2013 a puppy that was found dumped in the street after all of her hair fell out has been given a wardrobe of jumpers to protect her sensitive skin			1
peaches was just nine - weeks - old when she was abandoned in the street suffering from a painful skin condition , which caused her to bleed when she tried to relieve herself by scratching			1
but after being rescued by @entity16 in @entity17 , members of the public have taken pity on @entity19 , and provided her with a wardrobe full of jumpers , hoodies and towels to help her on a speedy road to recovery			2
@entity27 suffers from a painful skin condition and has been given a wardrobe of clothes to protect her from the elements peaches was rescued by @entity16 in @entity17 and is on the road to recovery @entity35 , centre manager at @entity16 , said : ' @entity32 has got a bigger wardrobe than me ! ' she 's a big fan of her pink hoodie , she 's becoming quite a doll			1
' when @entity27 was found , she was so neglected that her nails were falling out			2
after being left by her owners , she was forced to roam the streets and scour for food to survive			0
members of the public have taken pity on @entity32 , and are donating clothes for her to wear until she recovers it is thought she was left due to her skin condition , which is caused by a mite , which gets into the skin and causes extreme irritation			1
@entity35 said : ' we believe @entity27 was born into a litter which contracted the disease			0
' it 's likely the owners were left with a mother and a litter of puppies who all had the skin condition , and rather than simply treating them , they let the animals get to this horrendous state , before dumping at least one of them			1
' if she had not been rescued when she did , it 's likely @entity32 would n't have survived			0
it 's an extremely painful condition , especially for a puppy			1
' it 's so sad because if her owner had just taken her to a vet when she first picked up the condition , it could have been treated so easily			1
' i have been here 15 years and i have never seen a case as serious as this			0
' peaches was first picked up by @entity76 in @entity77 , where she was due to be put down until @entity16 rescued her			1
taking her straight into isolation to prevent other dogs picking up the contagious disease , staff at @entity16 began to nurse her back to health by bathing her skin with a specialist shampoo			2
' she is being treated with tablets and we have to bathe her everyday , ' @entity35 said			2
' we must wash her with a shampoo which costs £ 60 a bottle , but it means her hair should grow back within a month			0
she has a wardrobe of jumpers and hoodies , including a red @entity98 jersey if she had n't been found when she was , it is likely @entity32 would have died from her condition ' we then have to pat her dry with a towel to ensure we do n't irritate her skin any further			1
' due to her tender loving care , @entity27 is well on the road to recovery and loving her new life			0
@entity35 said : ' given everything she has been through , she is so trusting of us			0
' when she came in she looked so miserable but her personality is starting to come out now and she 's beginning to behave like a puppy - it 's hard to stop her bouncing around ! ' the public have been so kind - they have so far donated more than £ 700 as well jumpers , toys and treats for @entity32			0
' peaches still requires further treatment including having her skin scraped to allow her condition to completely clear up			2
she will then be taken in by a foster home to ' learn how to be a dog ' , before being permanently homed			0
@entity16 has set up a just giving page for @entity32 , where people can donate to help get her back on her feet , here .			0
