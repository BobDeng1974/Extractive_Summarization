by @entity1 reporter published : 02:31 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 04:10 est , 25 may 2012 warning : greeks are being urged to keep their money in the nation 's banks and not to stash their cash at home greeks are being urged to keep their money in the nation 's banks and not to stash their cash at home - as thieves continue to profit from the country 's economic uncertainty			1
police say brazen burglars are making off with hundreds of thousands of euros , on an almost daily basis , as they raid homes where money is hidden in cupboards or under the mattress			1
@entity23 and @entity24 , both 80 , are just one of the many victims targeted by unscrupulous robbers			1
the couple took out € 80,000 and hid it in their home , on the island of @entity32 , because they thought their bank would collapse			1
but days later thieves came in the night			1
@entity24 said : ' we were sleeping			1
the two masked burglars came to our bed and tied us up			2
they robbed us - they did n't leave anything , it was torture			2
' @entity23 added : ' our life is black now			1
they took our life 's savings			2
' no - one knows exactly just how much cash lies stashed in @entity52 homes , secreted in cupboards , at the back of the ice - box , beneath the floor or under the mattress			1
but by any guess it is well in the billions , and burglars are after their share of loot which is both highly portable and virtually impossible to recover			1
@entity52 's debt crisis has plunged it into five straight years of economic contraction , thrown half of its young people out of work and may see it ejected from the eurozone			2
civil disorder : as well as the targeting of homes , there has also been violence on the streets of @entity52 in recent months in the past two years , @entity52 have withdrawn from banks more than € 72billion - or close to € 7,000 for every man , woman and child in the country			1
and much of that has been taken in cash			2
police say gangs who may have once eyed ' hard targets ' , - like the banks themselves , or jewellers - are now going after homes of ordinary people , where there is far less risk and often large stashes of cash freshly withdrawn from savings accounts			2
' many people have withdrawn their money from the banks fearing a financial crash , and they either carry it on them , find a hideout at home or in storage rooms , ' said national police spokesman @entity102			1
he said : ' we urge people to trust the banking system , leave their money there , or at least in a safe place , not hide it at home , where they must anyway take the basic security measures			1
little wonder : but with shares in @entity52 firms plunging , and the nation 's banks having to be bailed out , many think keeping their money at home is the sensible option ' some people do n't even lock their doors and windows			1
' the unexpected bonanza is attracting foreign crime networks , he said , including two from @entity126 @entity125 which police dismantled in recent months , blaming them for 300 burglaries			2
crime is just one hazard for people storing unusually large hoards of cash , most of which are not insured			2
@entity137 , 30 , withdrew his savings of € 8,000 and kept them in his house at @entity140 , a small town 200 miles from @entity141 and known principally for its @entity143 stone bridge and a 13th - century church			1
he said : ' i hid the money in two different places before leaving for a trip			2
when i came back it was all gone			2
they broke into the house through a balcony door and they took it all			2
' we used to sleep outside with the doors unlocked			0
now we do n't feel safe even when we lock up			0
they break into homes , shops , businesses			0
there is a surge in robberies here			0
' in @entity166 , a working class neighbourhood of @entity141 , local people say some thieves have become so brazen they often prowl in broad daylight , even when a family is in			0
' we were sitting on the front veranda chatting when they jumped from the roof to the back yard and got into the house , ' said pensioner @entity176 , 61			0
before he realised what had happened , they had made off with his family 's gold			0
' burglars hear that people are scared and withdrawing money and they hit homes randomly hoping they will be lucky , ' he said			0
' i feel like i 've been naive			0
we always used to leave all the doors open ; we had nothing to worry about			0
' there are tales of savings going up in smoke in fires or , as in one case , being lost when a pensioner withdrew his life savings - then died suddenly , before telling his family where they were hidden			1
theft , though , seems the biggest risk and the crime wave has spread far beyond the big cities into rural areas where robbery was little known			0
according to the central bank , @entity52 withdrew € 72billion from bank accounts between january 2010 and march 2012 , leaving just € 165billion behind			1
since then , withdrawals have accelerated further after an inconclusive may 6 election led @entity210 leaders to talk openly of @entity52 exit from the single currency			0
some of that money was wired abroad and some spent , but much of it was hidden in homes , either in cash or converted to gold			1
if @entity52 leaves the common currency area , any money left in @entity52 banks would probably be turned into drachmas worth a good deal less			0
euros stashed in a box at home would still be euros			1
' people have already taken their money out of the bank			0
the rest are doing it now because they are afraid we will be kicked out of the eurozone , ' said one police officer			0
among cases he said he had come across in the past week : a man reported € 30,000 in cash and gold stolen from a storage room next to his house and an elderly woman had her life savings of € 100,000 stolen from her apartment			1
that woman 's home also happened to be packed full of cartons of long - life milk and boxes of pasta - in case , she explained , the economic crisis led to food shortages			1
stashing cash is as old as @entity52			0
the countryside is dotted with archaeological sites where the ancients squirreled away their silver drachmas to hide them from marauding armies			0
@entity52 museums are rich in treasure whose owners never made it back			0
' hiding valuables - small or larger amounts of coins , golden , silver , even bronze - was very widespread in antiquity , especially in times of war , crisis or difficulty , ' said @entity274 of the @entity275			0
' sometimes the owner would perish and this is how they reached us , hidden in the ground , in holes in the wall , small vases under the floor or leather bags			1
' future archaeologists may yet stumble on some of the buried treasure of the euro zone crisis of 2012			0
a senior banker tells the story of a family on the island of @entity293 who recently visited their local branch , trying desperately to figure out how much their late father had withdrawn before he died			1
not trusting the bank , the old man had taken out his life savings			0
but he had n't told anyone where he hid it			0
his children were searching everywhere , tearing down walls in the house trying to find it , but with no luck .			0

@entity23 and @entity24 , both 80 , had € 80,000 taken from island home
billions of euros hidden in cupboards and under *floorboards* across nation
