a pregnant woman was left with these life - changing injuries after a close friend 's dog mauled her face until it was ' hanging off '			1
@entity5 , 21 , said she feared she and her unborn baby would die when the @entity9 @entity8 dog attacked her as she sat sending a text message			1
the animal leapt up and tore at her face , ripping chunks of flesh from her mouth and cheeks , leaving her needing 60 stitches			2
friends then tried to drag the pet off her and only succeeded when they repeatedly kicked the dangerous dog , which was later destroyed			2
the dog 's owner has become the first in @entity24 to be prosecuted under tough new laws after failing to control the seven stone @entity8			1
@entity5 had to give birth to baby @entity40 - now 15 weeks old - by c - section because doctors felt she may not be able to withstand the pain of a natural birth due to her injuries			1
in a landmark prosecution , the dog 's owner , @entity46 , received a 16 - week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay @entity5 just £ 1000 in compensation			1
