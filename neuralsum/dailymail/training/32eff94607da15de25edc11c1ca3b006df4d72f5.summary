former @entity1 mp @entity0 has finally confessed she has had a facelift , saying : ' i like the way i look and like to keep it that way '			1
the outspoken chick - lit novelist made the admission speaking on @entity10 ’s @entity9 from @entity11 , after nearly three years of repeated speculation about her appearance			1
mrs @entity0 , 41 , had previously refused to say that she had cosmetic surgery while she was working at @entity15 , but told @entity16 last night : ' i had a little tightening in my face ' for ' maintenance '			1
are n't you worried about what example you set ? '			1
responding to the compliments by saying ' carry on ' , mrs @entity0 then denied she was a bad role model adding : ' the desire to look good is not entirely negative '			2
the author had refused to answer the question when a journalist spotted her facial scarring in 2011 because she felt it was ‘ trivialising women politicians based on their appearance ’			1
but now she is no longer a politician , she said she felt she could talk about the procedure , which she claims she did ‘ just for maintenance ’ , because she likes the way she looks and was ‘ very happy ’ with the result			1
plastic surgery addict @entity43 was also on the programme , who admitted having 500 procedures and going into rehab as a result			2
she said her obsession had left her physically and mentally scarred			2
debate : mrs @entity0 was on @entity9 to debate cosmetic surgery , but refused to accept an accusation by @entity16 that she had set a bad example problems : plastic surgery addict @entity43 was also on the programme ( left ) and said her years of surgery and procedures had been damaging mentally and physically in 2011 , mrs @entity0 , now 41 , was asked if she had had a facelift			1
a reporter later wrote of seeing ‘ incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh , they still have tiny lines of scab ’			1
the writer thought it may be evidence of a ‘ @entity71 facelift ’ , a procedure that is known for its short recovery time			1
at the time , mrs @entity0 responded : ‘ my @entity74			1
i ’ve always wondered what i would say the first time somebody asked me this question			1
and without denying it , i ’m going to refuse to answer			2
’ but last night she told @entity16 : ‘ i refused to answer that question , not because i was embarrassed about the procedure but because people are always trying to trivialise women politicians based on their appearance			1
‘ but as i am no longer a politician ... i had it done just for maintenance			1
it was something that i had carefully researched , i picked a very qualified surgeon , i was fully aware of the risks and the rewards '			2
refusal : a reporter wrote of seeing ' incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet and last night the @entity1 told @entity16 : ' i had a little tightening in my face ' marriage : @entity0 with her husband @entity100 , who she moved to @entity11 with after quitting as mp for @entity102 when mr @entity16 said he still did n't understand why she did it , mrs @entity0 replied : ' i like the way i look and i wanted to keep it that way			1
and i 'm very happy with the results			2
' i had a very , very good surgeon			2
the difference is subtle if you get somebody who knows what they are doing			2
' after the show @entity114 got in a row on @entity117 when a member of the public accused her of lying when she was in @entity22			2
' that 's libellous b * * * * * * *			2
a real slander and a slur			2
refused to answer question , ' she wrote			1
' refusing to answer a sexist question is not a denial			0
' row : after the show @entity0 got involved in a row on @entity117 after this user accused her of lying while an mp response : the former mp called the statement ' libellous b * * * * * * * ' denying that she had lied or denied it final statement : the chick - lit author again claimed the original questions asked about her facelift were sexist so she refused to answer it in her column in @entity142 this morning she said that women should be able to ' make their own decisions about their own bodies ' , adding she admired 59 - year - old supermodel @entity146			1
' my anti-ageing idol is @entity146			0
if she 's had work done , you know , so what ? the girl looks absolutely amazing '			0
last year she condemned the ‘ trivialisation ’ of women politicians judged on their appearance			1
the former backbencher , who rose to prominence during @entity159 ’s grilling on phone - hacking by the @entity162 culture committee , used a glamorous photo shoot and interview with @entity165 to make the claim			0
younger than her years : @entity146 looked youthful and toned as she filmed a workout video on @entity169 beach last month , and @entity0 calls the supermodel her ' anti-ageing idol ' ' you do n't trivialise a woman politician based on her ap ­ pearance , ' she told @entity165			1
' as the pieces flowed in the next day , everything i had said was washed away under the fluffy - bunny thing of looks '			0
in august last year she sensationally quit as an mp , saying she could not represent @entity102 in @entity181 because she could not juggle her political and family life			0
mrs @entity0 moved to @entity11 with her three children to live with her second husband @entity184 , who manages rock group @entity185			0
after years of refusing to reveal if she had a facelift , @entity0 has at last admitted she had one			0
but there is still speculation about the exact procedure the former mp had			0
it is believed she had a version of the ' @entity192 ' , which is well known because it is done under local anaesthetic and causes less bruising and noticeable scarring than a full facelift			0
a procedure of this speed , which takes just a few days to recover from , could have allowed mrs @entity0 to have had one during the summer parliamentary recess in 2011			1
after meeting her that year @entity201 interviewer @entity200 said she saw ' incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh ... they still have tiny lines of scab '			0
mrs @entity0 replied to her at the time : i 'm going to refuse to answer your question , because if i did that i 'd become the " minister for mascara "			0
she added : ' my beauty secrets are between me and my various , er , therapists			0
i 'm refusing to answer your question			0
but you should note that i 'm not denying anything			0
' she may have had something similar to the procedure known as the @entity219			0
under local anaesthetic , a small semicircle of skin is cut away where the hair - line meets the ear , exposing the cheek muscle			0
the muscle is then pulled tight and the skin is sewn shut with a running stitch			0
another common version of the quick @entity71 facelift is something called the ' silhouette lift '			0
very fine threads , almost like fishing wire , are inserted under the skin and used to pull up the face via a series of incisions on the scalp			1
there is also the @entity242 , where incisions are made above and around the ear before the flesh is pulled tight			0
it is carried out under general anaesthetic and takes about two weeks to recover from , with patients banned from any strenuous exercise , including sex and housework .			0

refused to comment to journalist in 2011 who asked her about facial scars
she told @entity16 last night : ' ‘ i had a little tightening in my face '
author felt questions about her face previously trivialised women in politics
' i like the way i look and like to keep it that way , ' she told @entity9
