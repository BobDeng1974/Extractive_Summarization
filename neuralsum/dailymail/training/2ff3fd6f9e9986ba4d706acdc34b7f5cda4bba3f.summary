by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed his fears for @entity4 's future as young stars struggle for first team opportunities in the @entity7			1
the @entity11 midfielder , on loan from @entity9 , feels that the influx of top @entity14 talent is a major driving force behind the stagnation of home - grown talent			2
@entity1 , who retired from @entity4 duty with 106 caps after the @entity20 , reflected on his progression through the ranks at @entity23 and believes it is a lot different for @entity26 prospects today			1
if i was the same age now i would n't be anywhere near the @entity46 or @entity11 sides , ' he told @entity47 ' like the other kids i 'd have had to go out on loan			1
' the 36 - year - old , who is @entity46 's all - time leading goalscorer after spending 13 years at @entity52 , acknowledged that coaching facilities are better than ever but there comes a time when players just need games			1
' if it was my boy i 'd think about sending him to @entity46 to have the best coaching from eight to 15 and , if possible , then send him to a club with less resources to try and get him in the first team at 18 , ' he added			2
' @entity64 and i were fortunate we experienced it at a young age			0
but the kids these days get lost			0

' from being talked up he was always having to go out on loan - and where do you go from there ? if the door 's shut , it can stay shut			0
' however , the seasoned midfielder also thinks young players in this country can often get ahead of themselves to make matters worse			0
' then there 's the fact these young lads have to focus and keep their heads when they start to earn very good money , ' he said			0
' they have to realise they have n't made it just because everyone is talking about them at 18			0
' next big thing ? @entity46 youngster @entity77 's development has been stunted at @entity52			1
