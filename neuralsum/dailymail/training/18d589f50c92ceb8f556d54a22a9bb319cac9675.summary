the @entity0 has decided not to penalise @entity1 and @entity2 for their absence from this weekend 's @entity5 @entity4			1
the demise of the two teams over the past week forced the stewards present at the @entity9 to review the circumstances behind their withdrawal			0
with both marques in breach of the sporting regulations which state they are to ' participate in every event with the number of cars and drivers entered ' , the @entity0 naturally had to look into the matter			0
@entity22 team @entity2 has followed @entity1 into administration this season a security guard takes down the @entity26 flag after the @entity1 factory in @entity28 was closed via a statement , the @entity0 has commented that ' in view of the current financial circumstances , the stewards decide not to impose any penalty '			1
in addition , the statement added : ' because of the particular nature of the breach , the matter is referred to the attention of the @entity0 president ( @entity39 )			2
' with the two teams given dispensation by @entity22 supremo @entity45 to miss this race and the next one in @entity47 , the stewards overseeing the race at @entity42 will be faced with the same situation			0
for the first time since the 2005 @entity50 , the race at @entity9 has its lowest number of entries on the grid			0
with only 18 cars present , the stewards have also decided to tweak the qualifying format			0
@entity22 supremo @entity45 has given both teams special dispensation to miss the @entity5 and @entity47 gps @entity0 president @entity39 has questioned financial failings after seeing his calls for a budget cap rejected instead of six cars exiting at the end of each of the first two sessions , it will now be four , ensuring the top - 10 shoot - out remains			1
the @entity0 , meanwhile , has again questioned the financial ' failings ' of @entity22 in light of @entity2 and @entity1 being forced to enter into administration			1
earlier this season @entity39 's plans to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques			2
despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former @entity0 president @entity81 was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to @entity39 's fury			1
now , in the words of @entity81 earlier this week ' the chickens have come to roost ' , with the financial unsustainability of running a @entity22 team leading to @entity1 and @entity2 's woes			2
offering a clear indication the situation has to change , the @entity0 has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes			0
drivers ' championship leader @entity95 ( r ) speaks ahead of the @entity5 @entity4 in @entity97 , @entity98 @entity95 was wearing a necklace featuring an image of @entity102 's ' cars , @entity101 300 @entity103 ' a statement from the @entity0 read : ' looking beyond the end of the 2014 season , these failings again acutely raise the question of the economic balance of the @entity0 @entity22 and justify the position , expressed many times by the @entity0 , in favour of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid or attract potential new entrants			1
' as such , the @entity0 , in close co-operation with @entity120 ( @entity45 's @entity120 ) and the different stakeholders in @entity22 , will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come			2
' many will view the @entity0 's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality .			0

the @entity0 will not punish @entity1 and @entity2 for missing @entity5 @entity4
