@entity0 is determined to prove his worth at @entity2 after returning from a fourth loan spell away from the club			1
many had expected @entity6 to depart the @entity7 after the highly rated @entity9 captain arrived from @entity10 in a Â£ 3.5million deal			1
two years on , though , the @entity13 international remains at the @entity14 , severely restricting @entity0 's match time at @entity2			1
@entity0 had a successful spell at @entity17 and now wants to become first choice at @entity2 @entity6 has kept fellow goalkeeper @entity0 out of the starting line - up at @entity2 since 2012 @entity0 has been forced to leave @entity2 four times on loan to get first team experience the 21 - year - old has spent time on loan during that period with @entity10 , @entity27 , @entity28 and , most recently , @entity17 , but is now back at @entity2 and eager now to usurp @entity6			1
' i want to play games , ' @entity0 said			1
' obviously i had a really good spell at @entity17 , but i 've come back now			0
' i am really going to try and put pressure on at @entity2 and get into the side and get as many games as i can between now and the end of the season , ready for the tournament			2
' the competition @entity0 is referring to is the @entity39 in the @entity40			2
it is a tournament @entity9 approach full of confidence after a qualifying campaign so impressive that manager @entity44 was handed an extended contract until 2017 on wednesday			0
@entity0 's first team appearances since joining @entity2 have been limited ' it is a massive boost for all of us , ' @entity0 said of the news			1
' he has been great for us and we 've got a really good set - up and a really good squad going			0
' there 's a really positive feel about it and it has been a big credit to @entity44 , what he has done and who he has brought in , in terms of @entity59 and other staff			0
' it is brilliant , what he has done			0
the lads are all really enjoying it and really looking forward to the tournament in the summer and hopefully making things pay off			0
' if any extra motivation was required , @entity0 needs only look back to the debacle of 2013 , when the @entity69 fell at the first hurdle and returned home from @entity72 without a point to their name			2
@entity0 spoke of his delight that @entity9 manager @entity44 signed a contract extension ' we 've got a really , really good squad , all pulling in the right direction and all get on extremely well , ' he said - something backed up by the fact he was speaking at the @entity83 in @entity84 , where he was with international team - mate @entity85			1
' that 's massively important , so we 're really excited , we 've got some big games coming up in march			0
' we 're looking to prove ourselves and test ourselves again , leading into the tournament in the summer and hopefully put @entity72 a long way in the past			0

@entity0 has found first team *chances* limited at @entity2
he arrived in 2012 but has had to leave four times on loan for experience
the goalkeeper is now targeting @entity6 's place at the @entity14
