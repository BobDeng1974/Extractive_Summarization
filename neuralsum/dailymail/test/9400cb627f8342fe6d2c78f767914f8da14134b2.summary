@entity6 players @entity0 and @entity5 have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe this is the second time @entity0 has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days the pictures will heap further embarrassment on @entity6 after other recent revelations involving @entity0 sterling on his feet holding a shisha pipe @entity0 , 20 , is battling controversy after the first picture , revealed on sunday , showed him smoking a shisha pipe			1
a video then emerged showing him passing out after inhaling nitrous oxide – otherwise known as ‘ laughing gas ’ or ‘ hippy crack ’			1
the @entity47 international has been the subject of a club probe into why he was taking the legal high			0
but the sight of 19 - year - old @entity52 , who has made his breakthrough into the @entity6 first team this season , will cause even more concern with club officials , who have declined to comment on the latest pictures			1

asked on monday if he will be reminding @entity0 of his responsibilities , @entity6 manager @entity95 said : ‘ i will do			1
he ’s a young kid who has been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class professional — it ’s not just on the field it ’s off the field , but i will speak with him on it and we ’ll move on			0

@entity5 is seen as a potential star at @entity134 after he announced his talent with a sensational display in february ’s @entity138 derby draw at @entity139			1
he had spent the past six weeks on the sidelines with a knee injury but returned to the starting line - up during monday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity81			0

when you ’re a 20 - year - old kid , you make mistakes			0
i did , i ’m sure we all do			0
it ’s just important that he learns from it because @entity0 needs to be on the back pages , not the front pages and that ’s a problem for him in these last few months			1
’ @entity5 pictured during monday night 's win over @entity81 , which kept @entity6 in the top four chase @entity6 manager @entity95 was due to speak to @entity0 to remind him of his responsibilities @entity227 chief @entity226 called for understanding after @entity0 ' made a mistake '			1

it does send a message to young people that if it 's good enough for footballers then it 's good enough for them and that is not desirable			0
' but you have to bear in mind that we ask an awful lot of young players growing up in the public eye			0
many of us look back at things we have done in our teens and early 20s and wish we had n't done them			0
' he 's made a mistake and people are human			0
i am sure this will be a minor blip on his path to a fantastic career			0
