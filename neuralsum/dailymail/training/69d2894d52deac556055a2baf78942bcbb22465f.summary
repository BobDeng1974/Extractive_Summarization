by @entity0 as @entity2 sat eating his picnic lunch among the gravestones of @entity5 in the @entity7 village of @entity8 , inspiration came to him for the opening scenes of @entity10 , in which the convict @entity12 meets orphan @entity14			1
many of the graves in the churchyard – six miles from @entity2 ’s former home in @entity18 – mark the resting places of members of the family of @entity22 , a landowner ’s widow who built nearby @entity24 in 1700 and whose family owned it until 1930			1
today , the beautiful three - storey , four - bedroom farmhouse sitting in grounds of one - and - a - half acres is owned by @entity28 and @entity29 , who fell in love with it the moment they saw it			1
dickensian manor : in the three years since @entity28 and @entity29 bought @entity24 in @entity8 , @entity7 , its value has jumped by more than a third , to £ 825,000 ‘ it was the only house we looked at when we decided to move from @entity40 to @entity7 , ’ says @entity29 , 31			1
‘ we were driving away from the viewing and i told @entity28 to turn the car round , go back and tell the owner to sell it to no one else			2
’ they agreed to pay the £ 600,000 asking price and moved in within weeks			1
it proved a shrewd buy , and in the three years since they bought it , its value has jumped by more than a third , to £ 825,000 , even though they have spent just £ 50,000 repointing the brickwork and improving the turning circle			1
they could have added more value by turning the former servants ’ quarters on the top floor into more bedrooms			2
the reason for the increase in value is the growing popularity of this corner of @entity66 and the improvement in road and rail links to @entity70 and @entity71 , which is just two hours away			2
trains from @entity74 station take just 19 minutes to travel to @entity75 ; the @entity77 shopping centre is 20 minutes away and trains from @entity18 or @entity79 take less than an hour to reach @entity70			2
‘ we can be at our office in @entity70 in 45 minutes , ’ says @entity29 , who , with @entity28 , runs an agency providing off - screen ‘ talent ’ , such as camera crews , directors and runners , to the film and television industry			2
indoor space : the three - floor home has four bedrooms , but the old servants quarter could be refurbished into four more she adds : ‘ we ’re only moving because we need to be nearer to my mother in @entity96 , but a house like this there would cost well over £ 1 million			1
’ the house is quintessentially @entity101			0
its reflection is clear in the pond in the garden			0
the rooms are generously proportioned and plentiful , and the decor is tasteful			0
one of @entity24 ’s other attractions for the @entity109 and their sons , @entity111 , five , and three - year - old @entity112 , was its top floor – 1,400 square feet of space that used to contain servants ’ bedrooms			1
‘ it has n’t been lived in for 100 years , ’ says @entity28			0
‘ at the moment it ’s stripped back to the plaster and has original oak floorboards and timbers			0
there ’s room for four large bedrooms because it has the same footprint as the floor below			0
’ the next owners of the property might not need four new bedrooms as the existing accommodation offers plenty of space			0
the four first - floor bedrooms are all doubles , and on the ground floor is a large reception hall , two sitting rooms and a wide staircase			2
there is also a breakfast / dining room with an @entity143 – this room could be turned into a large kitchen to replace the smaller existing one			0
inspiration : the village of @entity8 inspired @entity2 for the opening scenes of @entity10			1
there is also an attached workshop , utility room and study			0
and it is no surprise to discover that the property has featured on the tv househunting show escape to the country			0
outside , the gardens include an orchard and enjoy views across the @entity7 countryside			1
a marble plaque on an exterior wall of @entity24 records @entity22 as its builder , and the village of @entity8 itself is steeped in history			1
its castle was built in the 14th century and , although most of it is now in ruins , a house within is owned by @entity172 , the television presenter and musician			2
in the opening chapter of @entity10 , @entity2 describes the churchyard where @entity14 ’s parents are buried as a ‘ bleak place , overgrown with nettles ’			1
@entity5 churchyard , however , epitomises the charm and tranquillity of the @entity101 countryside			0
‘ this part of @entity7 is becoming more and more desirable because you get a lot for your money , ’ says @entity28 , 34			1
‘ it ’s a beautiful little village with a great traditional pub. we wo n’t get anything like this where we ’re looking			0
’ ironically , for some buyers , @entity24 ’s rural location may be a deterrent			1
‘ it is in a very quiet spot , ’ says @entity195 , of the estate agency @entity196 in @entity197 , which is selling the house			0
‘ a lot of people either want to live in town or just outside			0
@entity24 is a lot more remote			1
’ however , he adds : ‘ we ’ve had a lot of interest , even though it ’s only just come on the market			0
