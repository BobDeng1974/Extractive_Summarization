it ’s been almost four weeks since the last race in @entity2 and during the summer break i have been able to reflect on the season so far and look ahead to the remainder of this year and even the 2015 campaign			1
i had a review with the team immediately after the last race			1
we went through the grand prix , where i finished fourth after starting from pole position , and looked to see how we can improve in the future			1
given what had happened in @entity2 , there was talk about team instructions , and it was something that we needed to discuss and go through			2
so , we have gone through it , and we now know what we are going to do for the remainder of the year			1
it was important to do that			2
i then went to the factory to discuss next year ’s car as more and more of the team ’s focus is shifting towards what we ’ll be doing in 2015			1
this is normal because you need to get a head - start on that			2
all the engineers were together , so they wanted to ask me questions , and get my opinion and insight for next season ’s design			2
away from @entity23 , i had a really good time off			1
i was on a boat in @entity54 near @entity55 in @entity56 for a week with my best friends			1
we did something called ‘ pizza hopping ’ which you can see on my @entity63 account			0
instead of bar hopping we tried out a number of different pizzas instead , because in @entity55 they have some of the best in the world			0
@entity56 job : i spent part of my summer break ' pizza hopping ' in a bid to track down the world 's tastiest pizzas friends reunited : it was great to spend time with my pals ; i 'm ready and refreshed for the remainder of the year our mission was to find the world ’s best pizza , so we tried out a host of different restaurants			1
it was a lot of fun , and we managed to find the best one at a restaurant called @entity92			0
if you are ever in the area you must check it out			0
it was a crazy , crazy place ; there were so many people at this tiny , random restaurant which is 140 years old			0
it is a phenomenon , and most importantly , the taste was amazing			0
i then spent a week in the south of @entity103 with my wife @entity104 , cruising around , driving a @entity105 together which was really good			1
i managed to get in some training , too			0
i also had my cousin ’s baptism to attend which was awesome			0
i am now a @entity109 and it ’s a very nice feeling as it is the first time , so that was great			1
other than that i spent some time at home in @entity114 getting ready for the next couple of races in @entity2 and then after that the @entity56 @entity26			1
it ’s difficult to take your mind off racing during the summer break , but i managed to completely relax			1
i definitely used my time off to refresh , but now i am ready to be in full - on attack mode for the remainder of the season			2
let me take a selfie : the @entity92 was a crazy place with over 140 years of history to boast taking it to the @entity22 earlier this week , @entity22 was announced as a @entity129 driver for next season			0
i do n’t really know much about him or what he done up to now in his career			0
of course he is very young but we ’ll have to wait and see how it goes			0
he will be only 17 for the first race in @entity136 , but i am not concerned , and i do n’t think any of the other drivers will be , although i am sure it is a topic that we will discuss			2
rookie : @entity22 will make his @entity23 debut next year at the tender age of just 17 - years - old @entity143 's the man @entity144 won his second race of the season in @entity2 last time out and he is definitely among a few drivers who have stood out this season			1
he is doing a good job and it is great to see how he is taking on his four - time world champion team - mate @entity152			2
of course it is surprising just how well he is doing because it was difficult to foresee a driver with limited experience taking on and sometimes beating his more established team - mate and performing in such an impressive way			2
i still expect he and @entity152 at @entity159 and @entity160 to be our strongest rivals for the rest of the year			1
all smiles : @entity144 has been very impressive since he moved to @entity159 from @entity129 reliability is a weakness i am 11 points clear of @entity169 in the drivers ’ championship , but with nine races left i will still be attacking and i am out to win races as it is too early to think about just finishing			1
we arrive at the @entity174 @entity26 and @entity175 for round 12 of the championship			0
every track has suited our car this season and i do n’t expect this weekend to be any different			0
we have got a great @entity182 engine and our car also is also awesome in medium - to - high - speed corners so it should definitely suit us			0
spa is a great track and one of the best on the calendar and with the car i have i am sure it is going to be a great weekend			0
reliability however , is a weakness for us at the moment and it is one of the things that we are focussed on because it needs to be at 100 per cent			1
we are working on it , and we will get there , but there is still a little bit of a way to go before we ’ll be totally happy			0
the team however , ca n’t work any harder because they are already giving it their all ; to do any more than that would be totally impossible			0
sitting pretty : @entity25 holds an 11 - point lead over @entity182 team - mate @entity169 with nine races left @entity208 of the @entity2 @entity26 @entity25 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity211 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity23 mechanics and their families , putting @entity23 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity25 on @entity223 @ nico_rosberg and @entity224 @ @entity225			0

it 's difficult to take your mind of @entity23 , but i 'm *raring* to go for rest of the year
i *'ve* spent time in @entity56 , the south of @entity103 and @entity114 since the last race
@entity169 is 11 points *adrift* , but with nine grands prix left i will still be aiming to win races **...** it 's too early to think about anything else !
reliability is a concern for us **...** we *'re* doing all we can to get it 100 *%* right
