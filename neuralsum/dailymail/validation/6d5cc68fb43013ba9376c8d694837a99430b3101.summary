a pair of stridently coloured slippers , so loud they should have come with earplugs , is proffered by a man in a flapping robe			2
‘ you want ? you buy ? @entity7 , sir ! very , vairree cheap ! ’ i did n’t want , i replied , i would n’t buy			2
i shook my head and walked on quickly			2
however , in this part of the world , refusal to buy is interpreted as a cunning bargaining device			2
obviously i must have wanted a colourful pair of slippers – and my speedy departure simply meant i was hoping to bring down the price			2
a vendor poses with a pair of slippers inside a casbah in @entity21 ( library photo ) he hastened after me , slippers outstretched			2
‘ no , really , ’ i insisted , ‘ i actually already have a nice pair of slippers			2
’ but he would n’t be denied			2
‘ how much you pay , sir ? best price			2
’ a circuit of @entity35 ’s souks , the crowded warren of retailers in the medina to the north of the famous @entity32 , is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience			1
if there is a @entity21 office of fair trading – unlikely , i ’m guessing – its writ fails to extend to the souks , and do n’t even think about going back for an @entity43 - style no - nonsense refund			1
the nearest soul - crushing @entity45 equivalent to the souks that i can think of is that moment of existential despair in @entity49 where you lose your bearings in light fittings and begin to think that you may never find the road out			1
a circuit of @entity35 ’s souks is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience mind you , the mysteries of the souk have always been over-romanticised			1
‘ come with me to the casbah and let ’s make sweet music ’ is generally supposed to be the killer line from the 1938 movie @entity60			0
in it , @entity65 plays jewel thief @entity67 , who uses the city ’s market as a hiding place and becomes entranced by the ravishing beauty of co-star @entity74			1
in fact the line is actually used by @entity79 cartoon skunk @entity77 in the later @entity81 send - up of @entity60			1
where else but @entity84 could a cartoon skunk manage to prove more memorable than @entity65 ? yet it was the success of @entity60 that inspired @entity86 four years later to make the @entity94 movie @entity95 , the first @entity84 film to weigh in against the @entity88 ( one supposes the big studios were hedging their bets on this )			0
the @entity97 resort is huge , with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18 - hole golf course i went to @entity95 , @entity21 ’s largest city , about 15 years ago to see how closely the modern - day place resembled the movie version			1
any similarity , of course , was purely coincidental as the 1942 film was shot wholly within the confines of the @entity107 studio			0
during the film ’s production , it was generally assumed that @entity95 would be a turkey			0
despite the lengthy written introduction at the beginning of the film intended to offer some explanatory historical context , few @entity113 viewers had the remotest idea where @entity95 was and had little grasp of its complicated place in a sprawling global conflict			0
the film focuses on @entity124 ’s attempts to get the necessary exit visas to fly to @entity126 with her husband			0
if this sounds daft , it ’s because it was a made - up device to drive the plot			1
a vip experience awaits passengers who fly into @entity35 and head to resorts such as the @entity97 @entity95 ’s director was handed the script on a day - by - day basis			1
nobody – not even the scriptwriters – were entirely certain what would happen in the end			1
the film struck a chord , however , and regularly tops the list of favourite movies			0
some lines , such as ‘ we ’ll always have @entity147 ’ , are unforgettable			0
some are execrable : @entity94 ’s @entity149 recalling with @entity124 ’s @entity150 the day the @entity88 marched into the @entity79 capital : ‘ the @entity152 wore grey			1
’ there is little in the real @entity95 to summon up @entity94 and @entity124 – it ’s a pretty bleak port : think @entity156 with palm trees			0
it ’s only when i visit @entity35 that i feel like crying : ‘ play it again , @entity160 ! ’ here is to be discovered all the mystery of the casbah along with the exotic heat of the desert and the intriguing mingling of @entity79 and @entity168 cultures – with the croissant set beside the tagine			1
if i had time , i ’m sure i ’d find @entity171 with @entity160 at the piano still burbling : ‘ you must remember this … ’ while it would be curious to enjoy a holiday in @entity35 without being taken to the souk , these days the city centre has become something of an optional extra for a new breed of visitors			1
in the past five years , there has been a substantial building boom in the outer reaches of the city with the construction of several extremely plush stand - alone resort hotels which offer everything you need in one self - contained holiday place			1
the hotel has 135 suites and villas all built in a style that manages to combine the modern and traditional that means you can now enjoy chic @entity35 breaks in cool top - end resort hotels – and your stay does n’t necessarily have to involve a visit to the centre of the city , avoiding slipper - buying jaunts altogether if you prefer			1
@entity35 is now also one of those places that you can enjoy on a cunning fly - cheap , stay - posh basis			1
from the @entity45 , there are now @entity208 and @entity209 flights with return fares from about £ 100 ( often substantially less expensive than competing flights to the @entity212 , for example )			0
and flying into @entity35 – unlike flying into @entity214 – passengers heading for resorts such as the @entity97 , one of the newest and most impressive , have a bit of a red - carpet experience awaiting them			1
a vip services man meets us off the plane and takes us straight to a private lounge , where we are served a mint tea as we complete passport formalities			0
we are then fast - tracked through immigration – pushed in front of a sizeable queue – and into the baggage hall			1
outside , we are met by the hotel driver who takes our bags to a brand - new @entity232 for a 15 - minute drive to the hotel , which lies about eight miles from the centre of @entity35			1
the @entity97 's imaginative kids ’ club features models of lifesize sheep , all woolly and very cuddly on the flight back , the reverse process is so well managed that we go from kerbside to aircraft seat in less than 15 minutes – i ’d go back to @entity35 just for this unwonted delight			1
we were fortunate enough to arrive at the @entity97 just after dark when the resort theatrically dresses up in exotic style			0
driving up to the main hotel building is pure @entity84 , with blazing fire pits and walkways illuminated by dozens of hand - lit lanterns – not so much @entity94 , more @entity252			1
the @entity97 resort is huge , with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18 - hole golf course lined with bougainvillea , laurel , roses and hibiscus shrubs – and shaded by some 4,000 olive trees , many hundreds of years old			1
if you ’re worried about the wisdom of having a water - hungry golf course sitting on the edge of the @entity264 , the resort is at pains to explain that it has been designed with the utmost care for water resources and local vegetation			1
guests can choose from a traditional restaurant or the main restaurant which offers a mixture of cuisines in the daylight , views extend well beyond the golf course across to the @entity277 , which provide a wonderful , shimmering backdrop			0
at night , with clear skies , you sit under a canopy of the brightest stars , a sight it is impossible to grow tired of			0
while it sits on a large site , the hotel itself is not big , with 135 suites and villas all built in a style that manages to combine the modern and traditional			0
and , unexpectedly for a hotel of this sort , the @entity97 is keen to attract families with even very young children			0
there is much to do here			0
the hotel has three pools , with the biggest one vast and stretching the length of the main building – a complex , connected expanse of water that spreads beneath bridges and around curves of the manicured gardens			0
there ’s always a quiet place to swim and sunbathe			0
the spa has an indoor pool , and the fitness centre has a heated outdoor pool perfect for laps			0
perhaps the real tour de force at the @entity97 is the extraordinarily imaginative kids ’ club which would not look out of place at a chic @entity319 members ’ club and features – this is the best bit – models of lifesize sheep , all woolly and very cuddly			2
the spa at the @entity97 has an indoor pool , and the fitness centre has a heated outdoor pool there is traditional local costume for dressing up , arts and crafts , mini tennis courts , stargazing telescopes , and a special children ’s pool			0
during the day you lunch next to the main pool			0
in the evening , you can choose from a traditional @entity21 restaurant offering mouth - watering local cuisine , or you can opt for the main restaurant which offers a mixture of cuisines			2
@entity344 01483 445 685 ) offers seven nights at the @entity97 in a two bedroom @entity346 ( two adults and two children under 12 ) , with breakfast , flights and transfers , from £ 3,868			0
best of all are the rooms , which are all chic , stylish , luxurious and spacious			2
i was able to resist the urge to leave the hotel for a couple of days , but eventually had to answer the siren call of the casbah , where i had my encounter with the slipper - seller			2
as i climbed out of the taxi in @entity35 ’s famously madcap main square , i found myself face to face with a baby goat			1
i had the perfect line ready			0
‘ here ’s looking at you , kid			0

find an intriguing mingling of @entity79 and @entity168 cultures in @entity35
the souk near @entity32 is now an optional extra in the city
