it has taken even more bravery than is needed to climb into the ring for @entity3 , as a devout muslim , to denounce the extremist barbarity which has now brought slaughter to the streets of @entity8 in the perverted name of religion			1
it required greater courage still for this @entity14 hero of @entity16 origin to travel to strife - torn @entity17 to help inspire the rebuilding of the school in which 132 children were among those massacred by militant @entity23 gunmen			0
all sane citizens of this country should be deeply grateful to a young public figure of such risky prominence for so fearlessly distancing himself , and by association much of his @entity4 community , from terror and atrocity			1
@entity3 ( right ) hands a cricket bat over to a @entity16 child in december after a shooting at a school @entity3 ( second right ) prays with soldiers after 134 children were killed at a school in @entity17 people gathered around candles and pens at the @entity45 in @entity8 in support of the victims after the terrorist attack on a @entity50 satirical cartoon magazine so why , despite the example which @entity3 began setting as a teenager at the time of the @entity56 bombing , does his voice remain so isolated in the world of sport in our supposedly @entity14 ? as the threat moves ever closer to these shores with @entity50 cartoonists , journalists , police and democracy itself being gunned down by fanatical jihadists , what do we hear from @entity3 ’s fellow athletes ? silence			1
even from his @entity4 brothers in sport			2
scour their @entity72 handles and what do you find about this assault on our way of life from @entity79 , the @entity81 - born runner who was decorated by the @entity82 for winning a couple of gold medals at the @entity85 , or @entity86 - the cricketer who , like @entity3 , is of @entity16 extract but who took to the field for @entity90 wearing @entity92 wrist - bands			1
@entity93 has positioned himself as a brilliant role model and has spoken out against extremism @entity4 @entity79 has kept quiet since the shootings in @entity8 on wednesday nothing that i can find			1
nothing about horror in @entity8			2
nothing about children being massacred in @entity16 , mr @entity86 ? nothing about schoolgirls being abducted and violated in @entity105 , mr @entity79 ? nothing to help @entity3 raise the standard for @entity14 tolerance and understanding to the level of that set by these giants of world sport : @entity118 , @entity119 : ‘ it saddens me that human beings are suffering and dying at the hands of violent extremists			1
i send my deepest condolences to their families			0
@entity116 does not support terrorism			0
’ @entity123 , master cricketer now @entity16 presidential candidate : ‘ we must unite against such inhumanity to rid our world of terrorism			0
’ cricket @entity86 , who wore a wristband showing support for @entity131 last summer , has also remained silent one of the terrorists fires at the officer at point - blank range - 12 people were killed in @entity8 on wednesday not that @entity136 and @entity86 are alone in failing to add their voices to the hundreds of thousands exorcising the right to freedom of expression , for which ten of the staff of the satirical weekly @entity144 and two members of the gendarmerie sacrificed their lives , by proclaiming in @entity50 : ‘ @entity148			1
’ where is the condemnation of these monstrous acts from @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , even from @entity155 who revealed a modicum of political awareness with his stance on @entity161 independence ? do they really not comprehend their power to exert influence for good ? do they not accept that fame and fortune brings responsibility ? but then what more might we expect from those who exist in such a privileged bubble that they have nothing to say about whether a convicted but still unrepentant rapist should be allowed to return to life as a role model for football - worshipping youngsters ? comfortable with it or not , there is a parallel to be drawn between carnage in @entity8 and denial in @entity184			1
it is to be found in the moral quagmire into which our society is sinking			0
@entity3 ( left ) , landing a punch during his victory over @entity190 in december , has become a role model while governments more feeble than @entity3 wrestle with both their conscience and their fearful dilemma with @entity116 - good and evil - the queue of advocates for @entity197 is lengthening			1
‘ he ’s paid for his crime , ’ they cry			0
‘ it ’s time to give him a second chance			0
’ in charitable work , an office , on the buses maybe - but not in football it is n’t			2
not when the supporters of this despicable man - at his behest or nor - have so vilely persecuted his victim on social media for so long , hounding her from one false identity to another			0
not when his apology for ‘ the effects of that night ’ is so cravenly qualified by a failure to admit his crime and is so belatedly offered only after his rejection by another football club that it is virtually worthless			2
not as the father of his sadly misguided girlfriend funds a legal campaign for a man so wretchedly lacking in remorse that it is hard to see how any father would want his daughter anywhere near @entity197 , least of all in his bed			2
@entity197 , pictured with girlfriend @entity229 , has failed to secure a return to football with @entity184 @entity197 was released from prison in october , with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate this has been not just character assassination			1
this has been terrorism of a deeply disturbing , personal order			0
it is not the @entity72 merchants who have been preventing this unpleasant specimen from returning to employment as a footballer			0
it is his thuggish reluctance to admit to his own wrong - doing			1
just as it was not those @entity50 cartoonists who provoked the killing of themselves with their lampooning of the @entity253 , as the political equivalents of the @entity197 apologists would tell us			1
it was the radicalisation of young @entity258 into ranting , raving , maniacs			0
@entity184 chief executive @entity260 ( left ) and manager @entity261 at @entity262 on thursday should sport join in the taking - of - a - stand against extremist atrocities ? indeed it should , as a daily sports paper in @entity50 so poignantly demonstrated			0
@entity267 ’s front page on the morning after the @entity8 slaughter was filled by this huge score - line : @entity270 0 , barbarite 12			2
so just to be clear : @entity271			0

devout @entity4 boxer @entity3 has publicly condemned the killing of 12 people in @entity8 by extremists
@entity79 and @entity86 have been *conspicuous* by their silence
@entity3 has been setting an example ever since he came to prominence
people calling for @entity197 to return to football are despicable
the convicted rapist has had a thuggish reluctance to admit wrongdoing
