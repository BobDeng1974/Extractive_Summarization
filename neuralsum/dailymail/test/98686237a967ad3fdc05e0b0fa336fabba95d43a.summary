with her mother by her side and nanny @entity3 already in charge of the nursery , the @entity0 wo n't be short of help when the new baby arrives			2
but @entity8 and ms @entity3 are n't the only ones on standby as the birth of the spare to @entity13 's heir approaches			1
waiting in the wings is @entity0 's fiercely loyal inner circle , a mix of school friends , society types and family members such as younger sister @entity20			1
so who 's who ? @entity22 reveals who will be helping the @entity0 as she gets to grips with life as a mother of two			2
@entity27 more than just sisters , the @entity0 and her younger sibling are also best friends who spend as much time together as possible			2

and i think that 's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other , treat each other normally			1
' and that 's sort of kept us all , you know , affixed to the ground			2
' but it has n't been all smooth sailing for @entity20 , who sources revealed has been a cause of concern to her royal in - laws thanks to her high profile			1
as a result , she was not among the godparents chosen for @entity13 , with royal insiders saying it would have piled even more pressure onto her shoulders			0
nevertheless , she has been widely tipped to make it onto the list for royal baby number two - possibly alongside @entity96			0
