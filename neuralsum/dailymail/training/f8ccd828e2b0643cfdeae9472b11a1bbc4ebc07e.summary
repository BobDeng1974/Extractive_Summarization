by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 13:17 est , 29 january 2014 a milestone in electric motoring was hailed today after a car was driven from @entity5 to @entity6 for free			2
the all - electric @entity7 became the first car to complete the 400 - mile journey without spending a penny on fuel or power thanks to a newly - opened network of charging points			1
red dwarf actor @entity15 , who played robotic servant @entity17 in the comedy series , set off from @entity19 with friend @entity20 and made nine stops along way to charge the battery			1
journey : red dwarf actor @entity15 ( right ) set off from @entity19 with friend @entity20 ( left ) and made nine stops along way to charge the battery in their all - electric @entity7 completed trip in 12 hours : each charge took 30 minutes and gave the £ 16,000 car a range of 55 miles inside : the pair completed the trip in 12 hours - three - and - a - half days quicker than it took a @entity36 crew in an electric car in 2011 each charge took 30 minutes and gave the £ 16,000 car a range of 55 miles			1
the pair completed the trip in 12 hours - three - and - a - half days quicker than it took a @entity36 crew in an electric car in 2011			1
a standard diesel car which does 50mpg would have used around £ 50 of fuel - but it was free in the @entity7 thanks to the growing network of complementary charging spots			1
mr @entity20 , 36 , a satellite communications engineer from @entity53 , said : ‘ we wanted to drive to @entity6 to put to bed the @entity36 ’s four day trip of 2011			0
‘ of course the point is that if you will have a leaf as your daily driver , but the odd trip to see granny in @entity62 is a piece of cake now			0
‘ the furthest we went between charges was 53 miles , but the @entity7 will happily do 80 miles			1
we had absolutely no drama and no range anxiety			0
‘ everything worked so well , i described the trip as mundane			0
we would stop for around 30 minutes each time , which gave the car an 85 per cent charge and that is good for more than 50 miles			1
getting around : a standard diesel car which does 50mpg would have used around £ 50 of fuel - but it was free in the @entity7 thanks to the growing network of complementary charging spots driving : the effort by mr @entity15 ( pictured ) and his friend was hailed as a milestone in electric motoring comedy : mr @entity15 played robotic servant @entity17 ( left ) in the long - running series			1
also pictured are @entity87 ( centre left ) as @entity89 , @entity90 ( centre right ) as @entity92 and @entity93 ( right ) as @entity94 ‘ the @entity36 set the benchmark when they did it in four days , but i think electric cars are now a genuine alternative to combustion cars			2
’ @entity15 and @entity20 stopped at the following service stations after setting off from @entity19 : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 ( quick test of new charger ) , @entity108 ( a media stop ) , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , which was the final destination			1
if they were going to do the trip in 11 hours , they would have stopped only at @entity117 , @entity102 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity110 and @entity111 , before reaching @entity6			0
the @entity7 , which is built in @entity118 , now costs from £ 16,000 with government subsidies			2
it has a range of 80 miles and , like other electric cars , it is @entity122 and tax - exempt			2
mr @entity20 now believes that with improving infrastructure and prices dropping , owning an electric car is becoming more sensible by the day			0
he added : ‘ i have a plug - in hybrid and i do about 300 miles a week on electric only and it saves me £ 3,000 a year			0
‘ @entity15 has done over 36,000 miles in his leaf and we met a chap in @entity131 who has done more than 50,000 miles			2
‘ an electric car now makes sense for a lot of people , it ’s only sales reps and road warriors who do a lot of miles that it wo n’t suit , but i do n’t mind stopping for a coffee			0
’ the charge spots were put in by @entity144 and @entity145 and are free to use			0
@entity144 now has charging spots at service stations on the @entity148 , @entity149 and in a number of @entity152 car parks .			0

@entity154 actor @entity15 completed the *challenge* with his friend
@entity7 becomes first car to complete 400 - mile journey for no fuel cost
they set off from @entity19 and made nine stops to charge the battery
