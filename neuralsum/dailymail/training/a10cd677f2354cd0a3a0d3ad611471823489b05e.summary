a film director has documented how his family went bankrupt after his father became obsessed with @entity3			2
@entity5 's father started collecting the cuddly toys in the belief they would make a great investment			1
but the @entity11 family realised there was a problem when , after spending $ 100,000 on the stuffed animals , there was still no return on the investment			1
pictured is his younger brother mr @entity5 has now filmed his family as they talk about the years spent collecting the @entity3 , in a bid to make enough money to send the three sons to college			1
his film , bankrupt by @entity38 , shows how his father 's obsession consumed the family 's activities as they attempted to collect as many as they could			1
surrounded by boxes of the cuddly toys , his father opens the film by telling the camera : ' this is like admitting to a drug addiction , you know , you want to forget it			1
' he goes on to describe how at first his three sons enjoyed collecting the toys , but one by one their interest waned to the point where he only continued to pursue his obsession in the hope it would make a financial return			1
the film - maker 's mother ( pictured ) has said they initially thought they could make a profit on the toys - but they never sold them the family 's home has boxes piled high full of the stuffed toys the @entity3 were first introduced to the public in 1993 , when creators @entity73 , which later became @entity75 , launched its original line consisting of just nine characters			1
over the next few years however hundreds of different types of @entity3 were produced as they gained in popularity			0
the company made an empire worth more than $ 6billion from the toys , boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995			1
at the peak of the collecting craze , many believed the designs which had been ' retired ' would rise in value			2
@entity5 was led to believe the toys were collectibles after he bought the first one , which sparked his obsession			1
the craze however failed to last much longer than 1999 , when @entity75 announced it would no longer be making the toys , and even made a bear called @entity101			2
nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as ebay - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped			2
sellers this afternoon were advertising ' bulk ' lots of @entity3 , which included up to 15 of the toys for just $ 29.99			2
there are however some which have certainly increased in price , including one ' ultra rare ' @entity115 , first edition , which was listed on the site at $ 6,500 this afternoon and had seven watchers			0
he says that is when he started to think : ' well what am i doing it for ? ok , i 'm doing it for a college education , which so far has never taken place because i guess i lost a lot of money			0
' his wife goes on to say how the family were under the impression they could make money from the toys			0
she says : ' probably from about six months from when we started buying them we were able to realise we could buy them then turn around and make a profit on them - although that was the plan , it never happened because we never sold them , we just bought them			0
' mr @entity5 has now told @entity145 how the entire family became wrapped up in the obsession			1
he said : ' it became this all - consuming family activity , filling up any free time that was n’t already earmarked for school or our youth hockey teams			0
' he even says one of his friends had to go to hospital because he ate too much @entity157 in a bid to gather the @entity3			0
he said the first @entity38 were bought when his younger brother @entity159 was with his parents in @entity161 where he saw one of the toys and wanted one			0
his father was then told they were collectors items , which led the family into the obsession over the next few years			0
but now he says he has little hope of ever seeing the money spent on the toys again			0
he said : ' the plan going in was for them to pay for our college tuition , but it became pretty clear that was n’t going to happen for us			0
' maybe by the time our kids graduate high school they ’ll have made a comeback			0
' mr @entity5 's father was told the toys would become valuable , but the family are still waiting for them to be in fashion again			1

@entity187 began collecting toys hoping they could fund sons through college
but they realised *mistake* after no return from spending $ 100,000
now @entity5 has made a short film documenting the obsession
