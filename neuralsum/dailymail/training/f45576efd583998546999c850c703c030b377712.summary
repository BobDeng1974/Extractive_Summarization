a 17 - year - old has created a line of snap - on underwear for those who struggle to put them on the normal way - one leg at a time			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity9 , @entity10 , came up with the idea for her line , @entity13 , when she had to wear a large leg brace for 13 months			1
after being forced to wear itchy @entity16 undergarments made by her mother , she learned to sew and started making her own snap - on underwear			1
' it 's nice to know you can have a pair of underwear that you can put on after surgery that 's not too bad , ' @entity20 told @entity26			1
the brace gave her the idea for her line of snap - on underwear , @entity13 snap on , snap off ! no guts no glory underwear come in three colors ( red , black and white ) and retail for $ 20 each @entity20 was born with a rare disorder called hemangioma that caused vascular tumors to grow in her right tibia , preventing healthy leg growth			1
by the time she was 13 , her right leg was misshapen and a full two and a half inches shorter than her left			1
the week after she graduated eighth grade , @entity20 underwent a seven - hour surgery to correct the growth , and was forced to wear a @entity54 , a four - pound brace with large pins going directly into the leg bone			1
the brace would stay on more than a year - and , @entity20 , who 'd previously filled her spare time with tennis , took up sewing instead			2
she said the frame eventually started feeling like a ' part of ' her			2
' it can be tough at times with everyone always staring at your frame but what i came to learn is that people are intrigued by the frame			0
i had more guys coming up to me and asking me all about it because they thought it was " so cool , " ' she says on her website			0
' everywhere i went i heard incredible stories , and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on ' ' i met many interesting individuals who had faced all kinds of challenges in the past but you would never know it			0
i met an outstanding baker with only three fingers , a woman who had a tree fall on her in a storm and many others			0
everywhere i went i heard incredible stories , and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on			0
' @entity20 even met former secretary of state @entity97 , who lifted up his pants leg to show her his own brace			2
heavy metal ! @entity20 had to wear her @entity30 for 13 months , and said it eventually started feeling like ' a part ' of her the long and short of it : before her surgery , @entity20 's left leg was two and a half inches taller than her right , due to a rare disorder that caused vascular tumors to grow on her right tibia the frame eventually came off - and her leg had successfully responded to all the treatments			1
' it was a long journey but well worth it as i gained 2.5 inches and am now back on the tennis courts ! ' she said to @entity120			1
@entity20 initially thought only others with @entity122 would be interested in her snap - on underwear , but realized there could be a larger interest after a followup operation			0
she overheard a patient next to her , who 'd just had a scoliosis surgery , getting a lecture about how she could wear only snap - up pants			2
' snap , snap is all they have to do			0
no bending at all , ' she reportedly told her mother			0
right now , @entity20 is offering no guts no glory underwear in two styles , three colors ( red , black , and white ) and three sizes ( small , medium and large )			0
they retail for $ 20 each .			0
