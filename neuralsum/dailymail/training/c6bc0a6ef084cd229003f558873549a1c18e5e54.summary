in a country as highly populated as @entity3 , examples of noteworthy driving are not difficult to find			2
but while high speed crashes and overturned lorries are commonplace , the relatively innocuous act of parking a car rarely makes the news			2
but two incidents this month highlight the extremes of parking in @entity3			2
while one man was filmed effortlessly squeezing his large 4x4 into a space only a few inches larger than his vehicle , @entity13 footage showed another making a complete hash of reversing out of a parking bay - crashing into the neighbouring vehicle a staggering 15 times before speeding off			1
@entity22 : without needing to correct his manoeuvre , @entity23 was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle ridiculous : the driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less skilled parking technique in the first incident , filmed in the city of @entity34 in @entity36 province , 31 - year - old @entity23 was seen parking his bright orange @entity38 in exceptional style			1
without needing to correct his manoeuvre , mr @entity23 was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle			1
the sublime parking had nothing to do with luck however , as the stone groove is actually outside mr @entity23 's home , giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap			1
the driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less rehearsed approach to parking			2
earning him the dubious accolade of the country ’s ' worst driver ' , the unnamed man was caught on @entity13 taking 10 minutes to simply reverse out of a parking bay			1
while doing so he managed to hit the car next to him a staggering 15 times			2
effortless : filmed in the city of @entity34 in @entity36 province , 31 - year - old @entity23 was seen parking his bright orange @entity38 in exceptional style ease : @entity23 's parking had nothing to do with luck , as the stone groove is actually right outside his home - giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap not a scratch : mr @entity23 was able to park his large 4x4 in the tiny space in a single impressive manoeuvre the footage , taken earlier this month in @entity79 , a city of around two million people in the east of the country , shows the hapless man trying dozens of bizarre angles and manoeuvres to get out the bay			1
had he simply reversed backwards out of the space , he 'd have avoided any bumps or scrapes			0
after eventually getting out of the parking space , the man was seen speeding away from the scene without making any effort to let the unfortunate driver of the neighbouring car know what he 'd done			1
he was later tracked down by police officers , who contacted local car dealers to find his identity			0
officers confiscated the man ’s licence on suspicion of being involved in a hit and run , pending further penalty measures , according to the @entity106			0
mirror , signal , massacre : the footage shows the hapless man trying dozens of different angles to get out the man , who had only been driving for two months , has been called ' reverse brother ' by @entity3 social media users he speeds away without making an effort to let the driver of the neighbouring car know what he 'd done the man , who had only been driving for two months , has been called ' reverse brother ' by @entity3 social media users , who wondered how he passed the driving test in the first place			1
' did he buy the licence , or what ? ' one said			0
bribing officials to obtain a licence is a common practice in @entity3			0
@entity3 ’s roads are notoriously dangerous			0
according to the @entity133 around 200,000 people are killed in crashes every year - the leading causes of death for people between 14 and 44 years of age			0
@entity3 has about 85 million passenger cars plying its roads , about 40 per cent fewer than in the @entity141			0
yet 67,759 people died in road accidents in @entity3 in 2009 - more than double the number in the @entity141			0

@entity23 , 31 , parked his bright orange car in exceptional style
managed to squeeze into tiny gap outside his home in @entity34 , @entity3
reversed into parking space in a single manoeuvre without any hassle
elsewhere in @entity3 , @entity13 captured a driver struggling to pull out of bay
