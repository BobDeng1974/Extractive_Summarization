by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 13:47 est , 8 november 2013 rising from the ashes of 9/11 , the new @entity2 tower has punched above the @entity5 skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country			1
@entity9 has it ? a committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting friday to decide whether a design change affecting the skyscraper 's 408 - foot needle disqualifies it from being counted			1
disqualification would deny the tower the title as the nation 's tallest			2
but there 's more than bragging rights at stake ; 1 @entity2 stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks , and the ruling could dim the echo of @entity31 's founding year in the structure 's height			2
without the needle , the building measures 1,368 feet			1
tallest towers : @entity37 , formerly known as the @entity37 , in @entity38 on march 12 , 2008 ( left ) and @entity39 in @entity5 on september 5 , 2013 ( right ) topping out : the 104 - floor @entity39 beats out 110 - floor @entity37 - but only if its spire is deemed admissible what 's more , the decision is being made by an organization based in @entity38 , whose cultural and architectural history is embodied by the @entity46 - formerly @entity37 that would be knocked into second place by a vote in favor of the @entity5 structure			1
' most of the time these decisions are not so controversial , ' said @entity52 , an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit @entity54			2
the 30 members of its @entity56 are meeting to render a judgment behind closed doors in @entity38 , where the world 's first skyscraper appeared in 1884			2
the committee , comprising industry professionals from all over the world , will announce its decision next week			2
to the point : a committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in @entity38 to decide whether a design change affecting @entity39 's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted the question over 1 @entity2 , which remains under construction and is expected to open next year , arose because of a change to the design of its tower - topping needle			1
under the council 's current criteria , spires that are an integral part of a building 's aesthetic design count ; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not			1
the designers of 1 @entity2 had intended to enclose the mast 's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel			0
but the developer removed that exterior shell from the design , saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair			0
without it , the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna			0
according to the architecture firm behind the building , @entity101 , the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment , but it will also be topped with an led beacon that will fire out a horizontal blaze of light visible from 26 miles away - a feature that has been described as a crowning beacon of hope			0
contention : the 110 story , 1,450 - foot @entity37 is in competition with the 104 - story , 1,776 - foot ( including spire ) @entity39 , a skyscraper built at the site of the 9/11 attacks @entity52 said the committee might consider amending its height criteria during the friday meeting - a move with much broader implications that could force a reshuffle in the rankings of the tallest buildings in the @entity128 the matter were n't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good - natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one - upmanship between @entity5 and @entity38			1
but 1 @entity2 is a monument to @entity31 resilience admired well beyond @entity136			0
' i do n't think anybody 's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower , ' said 31 - year - old software developer @entity141 , who works across the street from the @entity37			1
' not only is it going to be the tallest building ; it 's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of @entity31			1
it 's a marvel of engineering			0
' from great heights : @entity151 , five , looks down from the glass balcony called @entity153 , suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the @entity37 's 103rd floor @entity37 ' we take our hats off to them out here in @entity38 and the @entity160 , ' said @entity161 , chairman and chief executive of @entity163 , the firm that manages the @entity37			1
' and we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world			0
nobody 's looking at this like a competition			0
' still , the @entity46 has a central place in @entity38 's history , speaking to the city 's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 @entity176 and its history of creating architectural marvels , said @entity179 , an archivist at the @entity180			2
@entity101 , headquartered in @entity38 , also designed the @entity46 , which opened as @entity37 in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity186 , had knocked it from the top spot			1
and the @entity46 can still claim to get visitors up higher : the highest occupied floor in the 1,450 - foot ( not including antenna height ) , 110 - story @entity37 is still higher up than that of the 104 - story 1 @entity2			2
rising from the ashes : @entity39 , built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the @entity2 in @entity5 at the @entity46 ' 103rd floor thrill - seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as @entity153 that extend outside the building 's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet			1
in @entity5 , the debate was upsetting to @entity203 , a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29 - year - old firefighter son , @entity204 , in the terrorist attack			0
' you know what ? i think it 's a ridiculous argument			0
it does n't matter to me what height it is , ' he said			0
' you know , my son 's not going to walk back in that door again			0
and that 's the big thing			0

@entity38 - based @entity54 meet today to decide if @entity39 will be named tallest building in @entity31
a design change to the building 's spire may disqualify the building from competition
without the spire , it measures 1,368 feet - shorter than @entity38 's @entity37 at 1,450 feet
the council will announce its decision next week
