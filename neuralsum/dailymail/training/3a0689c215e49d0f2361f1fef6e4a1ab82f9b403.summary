by @entity1 reporter published : 01:44 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 08:35 est , 8 january 2014 a bombshell report released tuesday sheds new light on why authorities in @entity6 have named former @entity8 star - and accused killer - @entity9 a suspect in the 2012 double - murder of two men outside a @entity14 night club			1
the new developments - detailed in a search warrant released in @entity17 in @entity18 - indicate that authorities believe that the june 17 murder of @entity20 is in someway related to the double - murder of @entity22 and @entity23 , who were fatally shot outside of the @entity24 in @entity14 on july 16 , 2012			1
according to the warrant , police say @entity9 and friend @entity27 - who later sued @entity9 , claiming that he shot him in the face last february - were at the @entity24 on the night of the double - murder			1
connection ? @entity9 , who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in june , was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive - by shooting in @entity14 in 2012 also at the club that night were @entity36 and @entity23			1
it previously has been reported that @entity9 and his friends fought with @entity36 , @entity23 and their friends prior to the shooting			1
however , there is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently released warrant , which was first obtained by the @entity46			0
according to the warrant , authorities believe @entity9 and @entity27 were in a silver suv that circled the block outside of the @entity24 , apparently waiting for @entity36 and @entity23 to leave			1
when the men left with their friends about 2:30 a.m. , the silver @entity50 pulled up next to the gray @entity53 were in and someone opened fire			0
the warrant does not specify whether authorities think @entity9 was the trigger man			2
the warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the double - murder after a detective investigating @entity20 's death - who also investigated the murders of @entity36 and @entity23 - remembered seeing @entity9 at the @entity24 while reviewing surveillance footage from the club taken the night of the murders			1
victims : @entity23 , left , and @entity22 , right , were killed after getting in an altercation in a club last year scene : the men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on july 15 , 2012 seized : police took an suv similar to one seen at the scene from @entity9 's uncle 's house additionally , authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the @entity80 nightclub - where @entity9 and @entity20 had been seen arguing two days prior to @entity20 's murder - who claimed to have information indicating that the @entity20 murder and the double - murder at the @entity24 were related			1
according to the warrant , @entity80 security guard @entity86 called the @entity89 police department on june 22 - just days after @entity20 's murder - and said someone had ' accidentally spilled the beans ' about the connection between the three murders in front of him			1
the combination of the tip and the detective 's recollection of seeing @entity9 at the club where @entity36 and @entity23 were murdered caused authorities to reopen the investigation into the double - murder			1
since the case has been reopened , investigators have seized the murder weapon in the double - homicide and @entity9 's silver @entity50 , which was towed from a home in @entity18 , @entity108 owned by @entity9 's uncle			1
the investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the @entity24 taken from the night of the double - murder that shows @entity9 and @entity27 entering the club immediately after the victims			1
according to the warrant , @entity9 had two drinks and then left 10 minutes later			0
further , it shows @entity9 and @entity27 leaving a parking garage near the club in the silver @entity50 about 1:30 a.m. - about an hour prior to the shooting - with @entity9 in the driver 's seat and @entity27 sitting in the front passenger seat			1
it 's unclear what @entity9 and @entity27 did next , but when @entity36 and @entity23 left the club about an hour later , the silver @entity50 was seen back in the area and captured by surveillance cameras at the parking garage			1
the suv was then seen circling the block near the victims at a slow speed in the lane closest to the sidewalk			0
at 2:32 a.m. , @entity14 police received a call about shots fired outside of the @entity24			0
@entity36 and @entity23 were killed			2
another man was injured in the shooting			0
witnesses told police that the vehicle from which the shooter fired was a silver @entity143 suv with one man driving and another in the backseat			0
other witnesses gave descriptions of the assailants that were similar to those of both @entity9 and and @entity27			2
evidence recovered at the scene led authorities to believe that the weapon used was either a .38 - or .357 - caliber pistol			2
in june , police found a .38 - caliber pistol in the trunk of a car driven by @entity161 , who crashed the car in @entity163			0
@entity161 reportedly told authorities some football players had been in her car and may have left the gun in her trunk			0
she currently faces three illegal firearm charges			0
@entity9 , who signed a five - year , $ 40 million deal with the @entity8 just a month before the alleged double - murder , has been held without bail in the county jail since he was charged with @entity20 's murder on june 26			1
