@entity0 are on course to whitewash @entity2 in their @entity4 series despite some late - in - the - day resolve from the tourists			2
declaring their second innings on 319 - 5 , @entity0 set a fanciful target of 449 that looked even more improbable when @entity2 lost @entity12 four runs into their chase on day four			1
but @entity15 ( 43 not out ) and @entity14 ( 26 no ) got the visitors to 71 - 1 at the close , meaning @entity0 will at least have to dig deep to wrap up a 3 - 0 clean sweep			1
@entity0 batsman @entity19 ( above ) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against @entity2 a fourth test hundred from rising star @entity19 did for them in @entity22 on saturday , the 23 - year - old posting a fourth century in only @entity24			1
he was unbeaten on 131 when his side were called in , having done more than enough damage			0
resuming on 23 without loss , @entity0 were keen to crack on and so they did , despite @entity30 going for 15 , edging @entity31 behind			0
@entity0 batsman @entity19 ( above ) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against @entity2 that brought @entity19 to the crease and he and @entity34 put on 113 for the second wicket in just over 30 overs			1
@entity34 , a first - innings centurion , made a well - crafted 65 before he was cleaned up by @entity38			0
@entity39 joined @entity19 and they added a 50 stand , before he went for 30 , the second man to nick @entity31 to the keeper			0
@entity44 added 17 and departed to @entity45 , but it mattered little as @entity19 continued , reaching his hundred off 156 balls			0
@entity0 's @entity34 plays a shot as the hosts made their way to 319 - 5 before declaring @entity51 made a rapid 46 from 30 balls alongside him but after he went , the captain was in no mood to see @entity55 build a stand and soon called his men back in			1
@entity19 ended with 131 from 189 balls and was soon celebrating with his team - mates in the field as @entity61 trapped @entity63 leg before for a five - ball duck			2
@entity15 and @entity14 at least made for a more comfortable night 's sleep , but the writing appears to be on the wall .			0

@entity0 set @entity2 a target of 449 to win after declaring on 319 - 5
@entity19 scored an unbeaten 131 for the hosts of just 189 balls
it was the 23 - year - old 's fourth *ton* in only his 12th test
@entity2 closed the day on 71 - 1 after @entity12 went for a duck
@entity15 and @entity14 *steadied* the ship but face an uphill *struggle* to stop @entity0 *claiming* a 3 - 0 series win
