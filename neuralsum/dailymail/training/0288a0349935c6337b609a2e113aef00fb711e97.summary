by @entity0 last updated at 10:22 am on 15th december 2011 @entity1 : environment secretary @entity2 announced two test areas will be selected and allowed to slaughter badgers animal rights groups have hit out at government plans to allow badger culling			1
plans for the trials in two secret locations were announced today by environment secretary @entity2 in a bid to try and eradicate @entity13 tuberculosis in cattle			1
for six - weeks next year marksmen will be licensed to shoot badgers in the two specific areas before experts decide whether the slaughter of badgers is rolled out more widely across @entity21			2
mrs @entity2 told the @entity22 that she wished there was an alternative but an oral vaccine for the disease is ' years away ' and injections were difficult to administer to wild badgers which needed to be trapped first			1
there are approximately 190,000 badgers in @entity21			2
the move was condemned by @entity32 , with one mp saying the thinking behind the move was ' bad science ' founded on greed			2
@entity39 mp @entity38 said : ' should n't a clarion call , gone out from this @entity43 today to all the right thinking , compassionate people in this country to frustrate this cruel and unnecessary slaughter of animals			0
' is n't it right that this is founded on greed and bad science by the nasty party ? ' while @entity53 mp @entity52 agreed saying shooting the countryside creatures would not eradicate @entity55			1
speaking in the commons he said : ' could she be quite clear with the @entity43 what level of mortality she expects shooting to achieve , because the very clear advice that we received ... was that shooting would not achieve a level of mortality high enough to make any difference to the disease at all			0
' ' we ca n't just do nothing ' : environment minister @entity2 said her decision had n't been easy the two areas have yet to be selected but mrs @entity2 said the culling will lead to a reduction of 16 per cent in bovine @entity55			1
this claim was violently refuted by animal rights groups			0
the @entity75 has recorded a version of the 12 days of @entity77 showing how 12 furry badgers will be shot , five cows will still be sick and four farmers will still be angry , three mps still confused and one vaccine still unused after the trial			1
@entity83 , the charity 's senior parliamentary adviser , said : ' we , and so many others , have been telling the government for years that this cull is not the answer to the problems with bovine tb but they are just not listening			1
' we feel like we are banging our heads against a brick wall for ages			0
so we have decided to sing about our frustrations instead			0
' and @entity96 said the evidence slaughtering badgers would eradicate bovine @entity55 is ' spurious at best			1
' a spokeswoman told @entity100 : ' evidence that a mass slaughter of badgers would reduce levels of @entity55 is spurious at best			1
the spread of bovine tb is , however , conclusively linked to the movement and intensive rearing of cattle in the meat and dairy industries , which ignore the fact that these sensitive , intelligent animals are subjected to exhaustion , pain , boredom , loneliness and fear			2
' but mrs @entity2 refuted the claims , saying this afternoon : ' i know there is great strength of feeling on this issue but i also know that we need to take action now before the @entity55 situation deteriorates even further			1
’ nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in @entity21 last year alone because of bovine tb , with the cost to the taxpayer set to top £ 1billion over the next ten years			2
the problem is particularly bad in west and south - west @entity21 , where nearly a quarter of all cattle farms were affected by the disease during 2010			2
both trials are expected to cost £ 500,000 in each of the designated areas for the pilot			0
the cost will be split between the @entity140 and @entity141			0
at risk : if the scheme rolls out 190,000 badgers could be at risk of being shot , regardless of of they are carrying the disease mrs @entity2 said the areas are expected to be around 300 sq km , double the minimum area required for licences to be granted			1
the @entity151 said it was ' clearly very disappointed ' and would consult lawyers to decide what action could be taken			0
bovine tuberculosis ( @entity155 ) is a chronic , contagious disease which can affect all animals including dairy cows			2
due to the seriousness of the disease , farmers take great care to minimise the risk of their cows catching it			0
research has shown that one of the major causes of infection in cattle is through contact with infected badgers			2
at the moment farmers can only try to stop contact between badgers and dairy cows , including ' badger - proofing ' farm buildings and feed stores			2
and @entity180 executive director @entity179 , himself a vet , said mrs @entity2 's decision appeared to be in ' clear breach ' of the @entity185 and amounted to ' institutionalised cruelty '			1
' for @entity141 to blindly push ahead with a pilot badger slaughter , despite compelling scientific evidence that it will be ineffective , hugely damaging to local populations and cruel , is an absurdly misguided decision , ' he said			0
' @entity191 are supposed to be a protected species so plans to decimate them surely can not be reconciled with an international convention on wildlife conservation			0
' mrs @entity2 said the government were ready for any legal challenges and saying minsters had a ' copper - bottomed approach to it '			1
both trials are expected to be delayed until after the @entity202 because of a heavy police presence is thought to be required to protect the public			0
a report by the @entity206 had found there were feelings of ' panic , stress and emotional devastation ' for farmers and their families as they repeatedly had to send cattle to slaughter , she told the @entity22			0
farmers want to see a policy to control badgers to tackle a problem they say is one of the greatest threats currently facing beef and dairy farmers ' in the meantime we can not just do nothing , ' mrs @entity2 added			1
' this terrible disease is getting worse and we have got to deal with the devastating impact it has on farmers and rural communities			0
@entity234 president @entity233 said : ' today is another massive step forward in achieving our end goal of a healthy countryside - both for badgers and for cattle			0
' i commend @entity141 for introducing these two pilot areas to confirm the effectiveness , humaneness and safety of controlled shooting			0
' we must tackle this terrible disease , a disease that sees tens of thousands of cattle destroyed each and every year			0
the most recent science shows badger controls are absolutely necessary , together with cattle controls , to get on top of @entity55			1
' no other country in the world has successfully tackled this devastating disease without first addressing the reservoir of @entity55 in the wildlife			1
' ' i think we would all agree that we need to stop the disease spreading further , to bring it under control and ultimately eradicate it			1
evidence tells us that unless we tackle the disease in badgers , we will never eradicate it in cattle			1
' no country in the world that has @entity55 in its wildlife has been able to eradicate it in cattle without addressing it in the wildlife population			1
' ' nevertheless , we still see a useful role for vaccination , particularly in the future			0
' she said badger control licences would be issued by @entity21 to farmers and landowners under the @entity276 1992 to carry out culling at their own expense			2
applicants will have to meet strict conditions to ensure the culling is carried out safely and humanely , with each licence covering a minimum area of 150 sq km over at least four years			0
the farming industry will be invited to come forward with a selection of two areas for the pilot and then they will be able to apply for a licence .			0

environment secretary @entity2 said trial is necessary to control bovine @entity55
outraged @entity75 been preparing for the bad news for months and recorded a version of the 12 days of @entity77 showing effects of culling
@entity96 condemn evidence culling badgers would eradicate @entity55 as ' spurious at best '
@entity180 ( @entity299 ) say the cull lacks ' *legitimate* purpose '
