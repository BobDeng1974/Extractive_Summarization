he 's known as the ' @entity1 ' , the ' @entity2 ' and dr @entity3 uses more of both than any other dermatologist on the planet			1
but @entity3 is n't just about the injectables			1
he made a name for himself in the beauty naturals world by pioneering the use of green tea in skincare , and has his own beauty range ( boasting products with names like ' @entity17 ' ) to prove it			1
still , it 's his cosmetic work and the invention of what has been dubbed the ' @entity21 ' that has brought hundreds of women in pursuit of eternal youthfulness to his door - a-list celebrities among them			1
the botox baron : dr @entity3 pioneered the use of injectables , and also green tea although @entity3 is evangelical about the anti-ageing power of green tea , he 's no slouch when it comes to using injectables on himself , and controversially , argues that cosmoceuticals should be used to prevent wrinkles as well as deal with them once they appear			1
' as far as procedures go , [ you should start considering them ] in your mid to late 30 ’s , ' he says			2
' in terms of prevention , it is never too early to begin cosmetic procedures and treatment			1
' one of the first to use fillers and @entity50 , @entity3 , who first set up shop in 1982 , was instrumental in getting the substances approved for cosmetic use in the @entity55			1
initially billed as an alternative to surgical cosmetic procedures , injectables have since become an industry in their own right , with spending on them going up by a staggering 784 per cent in the last decade alone			1
so was he expecting @entity50 to be such a success ? ' i did , ' he replies , enthusiasm in his voice			2
' i saw its potential when i first started using it			1
' i marbled the results upon initial use and knew it was going to be one of the most innovative , influential procedures to be performed			2
not that @entity3 is resting on his laurels			1
despite his love for the wrinkle - freezer , he 's casting around for something new , despite not being totally convinced by the results he 's had thus far			2
ideal : devotees of the new new face want the radiant youthful looks of @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 new : dr @entity3 's new cc cream launches in the @entity87 next month exclusively at @entity88 ' the newest form of botox to be approved in the @entity55 is @entity91 which has a lower amount of protein mixed in with the toxin , ' he muses			1
' it remains to be seen whether it differs substantially from the presently available forms			2
' @entity50 or @entity91 , the reason for the success of @entity3 and his ' @entity21 ' is the result			1
unlike traditional cosmetic surgery , ' new , new face ' treatments should leave you looking fresh - faced , radiant and recognisable , albeit considerably younger			1
so at what point should you start ? according to @entity3 , although treatment for preventing wrinkles can never begin too soon , you need to wait until you actually have some before bringing out the big guns			1
' if you have no lines , you are too young , ' he says			0
' i feel that there is no " right age " to start considering @entity50 as it is based more on a patient ’s biological age rather than their chronological age			0
' for example there are women in their 20 ’s with a lot of sun damage who are showing signs of aging who might be a candidate for it when at the same time there are women in their 40 ’s who do not have fine lines or wrinkles yet			0
he 's also wary of overdoing it and is rumoured to have turned actress @entity83 away when she asked for more botox than he deemed necessary			2
' it definitely is possible to have too much @entity50 , ' he reveals			0
' if you use too much , you can create a very unnatural look , and you can also create a heavy brow effect if you over-botox the forehead			0
' how about women who want to avoid injectables altogether ? what should they be doing ? once again dr @entity3 has some advice			1
' the most important thing is to apply sunscreen every day - minimum of @entity147 , come @entity148 , ' he says			0
' try to avoid the sun whenever possible			0
a teaspoon of sunscreen should be used for the face , and an additional teaspoon should be used for each arm			0
' @entity155 should be re-applied when you are exposed to the sun for prolonged periods of time			0
apply peptide cream at night and antioxidant cream daily , ' he continues			0
' exfoliate the skin once or twice a week , depending on skin type and lastly , apply eye cream morning and night			0
' dr. @entity3 ’s new @entity167 mat beauty balm , £ 34 , launches next month and will be available exclusively at @entity88 big business : the use of cosmetic fillers and @entity50 has increased by 734 per cent over the last decade from a super-smooth forehead to gently plumped lips and a fresh - faced glow , @entity171 is all about looking like you , only better and younger			1
@entity83 and @entity84 , both of whom look like improved versions of their younger selves , are the ideal			0
forehead : smooth and wrinkle - free , usually achieved with the help of @entity50 injections eyes : wide and @entity187 - like with no deep creases in between			0
this can be created by injecting filler into the lower eyelids			2
nose : straight and feminine			0
@entity193 of @entity195 's nose is currently the most requested model			0
lips : full and slightly turned up , although not too much : trout pouts are definitely out @entity199 : plump and youthful			0
this is created by injecting filler just below the cheekbone , which adds anti-ageing volume .			2

dr @entity3 first started working on cosmetic jabs in the 1990s
today he uses more botox and filler than any other dermatologist
he also *researched* green tea benefits and uses it in his beauty range
