@entity5 , 18 , is so interested in technology - and , specifically , @entity3 products - that he writes in his spare time for website @entity9			2
in four weeks alone , the teenager correctly predicted seven out of eight announcements that the tech giant then made at the @entity13 in @entity14 on monday			1
inside track : @entity15 correctly predicted seven out of eight announcements that @entity3 then made at the @entity13 in @entity14 on monday by any reporter 's standards , that is some hit rate , especially when his eighth prediction has not been proven incorrect and could still come true			1
but when you consider that @entity5 is attending high school in @entity23 , it is fast making him something of a celebrity as @entity3 fans seek out a reliable source for what lies in store			0
on may 11 , @entity5 claimed that @entity3 would announce that its forthcoming @entity31 operating system would ditch @entity32 and replace it with its own in - house 3d version			0
that same day , he said the @entity34 would include web versions of @entity3 's @entity37 apps			0
on may 14 , he predicted the @entity39 - based firm would revamp its 15 - inch @entity40 with an ultra-thin design , retina display and super-fast @entity43			1
predictable : @entity45 , senior vice president of @entity46 at @entity3 , demonstrates turn - by - turn navigation in @entity31 using @entity48 during the @entity13 eight days before the @entity13 , on june 4 , he predicted that @entity3 would introduce its voice - activated @entity48 control system on the @entity50 ; that @entity51 would be integrated into @entity31 ; and that the firm would introduce an revamped line of @entity54			1
and a day later , he claimed @entity3 would update its @entity55 after two years without an update			0
all of the above were proved to be correct when @entity3 top executives took the stage at the @entity13 on monday			1
the only prediction yet to be proven , was @entity5 's may 15 claim that @entity3 is working on @entity62 and imacs with retina @entity64 , this could still be correct			0
