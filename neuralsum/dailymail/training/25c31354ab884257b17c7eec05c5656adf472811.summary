wasting police time : a woman called 999 because her ice cream lacked enough chocolate sprinkles a woman dialled 999 because she was sold an ice cream without enough chocolate sprinkles and told police : ' it does n't seem like much of an emergency - but it is '			1
@entity8 has released the audio and admitted they found the plea to the emergency services ' unbelievable ' because someone in danger could have been trying to get through			1
the caller contacted them while arguing with the owner of an ice cream van because she was unhappy with what she was served			1
during the minute - long call , the indignant woman told the operator : ' it does n't seem like much of an emergency but it is a little bit because i 've ordered an ice cream and he 's put bits on one side and none of the other			1
' he 's refusing to give me my money back and saying that i 've got to take it like that			1
' in the minute long call , she says : ' hello i 'm sorry to ring , i know it does n't seem much of an emergency but i 'm at an ice cream van and i 've ordered an ice cream , yeah ? ' and the person has basically he 's given me the ice cream and put the bits on one side , none on the other			1
' i said can you do it properly please and he 's like that " no , no " he 's not doing it properly			2
' i said ok fine then can i have my money back and you can keep your ice cream and he is refusing to give me the money back and saying i 've got to take it like that			1
' at this point the frustrated 999 caller interjects and tells her : ' its not really a police matter , it 's a civil matter			2
' the unapologetic woman still presses the operator and asks : ' how do i deal with this ? ' it was the latest in a string of crank calls to the 999 services across the @entity72 in recent months			2
only on monday the force had a call from a homeowner who wanted to report a rat in her kitchen			0
and last year police released a recording of a man who dialled police to complain about a prostitute 's looks after meeting her outside a hotel			2
another caller sought help from emergency operators after forgetting her @entity90 password , while a man dialled 999 to ask how to dial the 101 non-emergency number			0
a separate ' emergency ' call was made by a member of public reporting a spiritual healer as a fraud , while another asked police ' to come out to frighten his sister			0
' other bizarre calls included a man phoning to claim to have found a hair in his food at a fast food restaurant			0
she is then told to contact @entity107 or trading standards to which the woman replies : ' how do i contact them then because i 'm standing outside the van right now			0
' the call ends shortly after the call handler tells her : ' try the internet ...			0
this is a 999 life or death emergency line			0
' @entity8 's @entity120 team tweeted from their account on sunday : ' 999 call from adult female who was reporting an ice cream vendor for not putting enough chocolate sprinkles on her cone ... # unbelievable ' today chief superintendent @entity127 , head of the force 's @entity128 , warned time - wasters that their calls could cost lives			1
he added : ' each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but , if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency , then a minute is a very long time to wait			0
' i can not stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only , for guidance this is defined as : a crime is in progress , someone suspected of a crime is nearby , when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened '			0

@entity8 releases ' unbelievable ' audio of *row* by ice cream van
she begs : ' he 's refusing to give my money back . how do i deal with this ? '
