by @entity1 reporter a key element to attending any football game is getting to the stadium hours in advance to grill food and drink beer in the parking lot			1
but anyone attending the @entity10 in @entity11 next year will have to go without the traditional , pre-game festivities - the @entity13 announced today that there will be no tailgating allowed at this year 's big game			1
' you will be allowed to have food in your car and have drink in your car , ' committee chairman @entity17 said at a news conference on monday			0
' and provided you 're in the boundaries of a single parking space , you 'll be able to eat or drink right next to your car			0
however , you 're not going to be able to take out a lounge chair , you 're not going to be able to take out a grill , and you 're not going to be able to take up more than one parking space			0
and it 'll all be watched very carefully			0
' no tailgating for you : the @entity13 has banned tailgating at next year 's @entity10 in @entity11 but the tailgating buzzkill is n't the only rule the committee is imposing for the @entity10 - how fans get to the february 2 game also will be regulated			1
the game is expected to draw an estimated 80,000 people			1
but the stadium will only allow about 13,000 individual parking spaces			1
the solution : the committee will charter buses to shuttle fans from nine locations throughout the region to the stadium - at $ 51 per person			1
and that 's after fans have , in many cases , already shelled out thousands of dollars to attend the game			2
no parking : in addition to tailgating restrictions , the stadium will only offer 13,000 parking spots for an estimated 80,000 fans and do n't think about taking a cab or car service to the game - no vehicles will be allowed near the stadium on game day without a parking pass			1
' nobody 's going to be dropped off by black car , ' @entity17 said			0
' you can have a black car , a green car , a white car , a red car as long as you have parking , and the car needs to stay on the premises the entire time			0
' so maybe you 'll just park further from the stadium and walk , right ? wrong			2
' you can not walk to the @entity10 , ' @entity17 said			2
' you can get your hotel to drop you off at one of the @entity81 locations or get the shuttle to take you to a @entity84 location , but you can not walk			0
' @entity17 said he expects about 75 percent of ticket holders will use public transportation to get to the game , and that the reduced parking capacity is the result of a larger security perimeter needed around the stadium for a game as high - profile as the @entity10			1
@entity10 committee chairman @entity17 and other organizers have dubbed this year 's game the ' public transportation @entity10 ' hosting the @entity10 in the @entity99 area is a rare occurrence and has required a lot of logistical planning by city , state and league officials regarding both transportation and security			1
it has been dubbed by organizers as ' the public transportation @entity10			0
' @entity109 , the commissioner of the @entity110 , said ' the department will suspend all construction before the week of the game and planned to staff @entity10 media day and game day at the same level it does for a weather emergency ' with the goal of keeping traffic on highways and bridges moving smoothly			2
a february blizzard - which is n't uncommon in the northeast - could potentially throw that plan off the rails			0
but it would make for an exciting game .			0

the @entity10 committee also has set restrictions on how people get to the game
fans will not be permitted to walk to the stadium
only 13,000 parking spaces will be available for an estimated 80,000 fans
