this has resulted in @entity0 launching a desperate $ 500,000 ( £ 320,000 ) online appeal for donations to fund his retrial			1
accused : @entity8 and @entity0 have been ordered to return to court for a retrial for the murder of @entity20 student @entity18 , pictured the computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for ' legal expenses ' but added he would donate anything raised above the target ' to a research foundation '			1

' i 'm deeply concerned not just for the issue i 'm facing and most of you already know about , but also because i do n't have resources anymore to fight this injustice			0
' i badly need to be able to hire experts , when needed , or pay my attorney fees , documents fees , and so on when the new appeal will start			2
' i hope to not bother you , but i need your collaboration to face this ordeal			0
otherwise i do n't want to forced to give up just for financial reason			0
' i hope you will understand			0
i 'm just asking if you , buddies , know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation			0

however a sizeable proportion of that was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including @entity14 's high flying @entity144 who is said to have the highest fees in the country			0
on his @entity114 page he invites potential donors to help him out via a page called @entity150 , and on it he adds : ' this new trial will take other ( sic ) six or seven years more with witnesses , transfers , documents , experts and everything will be discussed all over again			0

i 'm no longer in a position to fund a trial which could last another two years			2
' they never once stopped chatting			0
it 's astonishing they are allowed to even talk to each other , let along see one another , considering they are both suspects in a murder trial ' witness ' witnesses will have to be reheard and there is a good chance that new forensic tests will have to be carried out and as such experts and consultants will have to be paid			2
' we are both very grateful for the high attention that has been paid to this case by his lawyers @entity144 and @entity194			0
' as of yesterday , 54 people had donated with the largest amount being $ 1,000 from an anonymous donor and the total standing at more than $ 4,500			2

miss @entity92 's body was found in november 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with @entity45 in @entity160 , a central @entity14 town popular with foreign exchange students			0

in the 74 - page cassation ruling , the @entity216 judges said they ' had to recognize that he ( @entity241 ) was not the sole author ' of the crime , @entity14 news agency @entity244 reported			0
the judges though said he was the ' main protagonist '			0
decision : @entity14 's judges have ruled that the possibility that @entity18 died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again they said the new appeal process would serve to ' not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime , but to possibly outline the subjective position of @entity241 's accomplices '			1
