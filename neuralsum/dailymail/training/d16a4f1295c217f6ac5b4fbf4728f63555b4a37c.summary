mr @entity0 said he supported devolution across the @entity14 , but warned sweeping powers could not be extended to @entity2 without a ‘ fair ’ settlement for @entity4			1
tories fear @entity7 could make capital out of any perception that @entity4 will lose out if @entity2 gains the power to set its own spending , taxes and welfare policy – or so - called devo max – in return for staying in the @entity14 , ahead of a potentially damaging by - election in @entity33 next month			1
@entity7 is tipped to win its first @entity35 seat in the @entity37 town in a contest triggered by the defection of @entity41 former conservative mp @entity40			0
mr @entity11 and the other party leaders have vowed to allow @entity2 to keep the @entity20 in perpetuity – which means the amount of money given by the @entity46 to @entity2 works out at £ 1,600 a head more than @entity4			2
mr @entity0 also hit out at the financial settlement , known as the @entity20 , which means taxpayers in @entity4 subsidise those north of the border mr @entity0 said yesterday that mr @entity11 and @entity50 had ‘ panicked ’ in making generous promises to the @entity2 government , on behalf of @entity4 taxpayers , after a ‘ lacklustre ’ start to the referendum campaign			1

they ’ve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years			0

i think what most @entity4 people want is a fair settlement			2
’ he suggested having days in the @entity72 when @entity2 , @entity73 and @entity74 mps do not attend – effectively an @entity4 parliament but without a new building			2
but he added : ‘ i ’m going to write today to all 59 @entity2 mps and i ’m going to say to them in the spirit of finding a fair settlement for the @entity14 , will you please commit from today not to take part in debates or votes in @entity35 on @entity4 devolved issues			1

mr @entity11 this morning , as a last - minute measure yet again , has decided to put @entity95 in charge of a committee to try to cobble together a solution … i think we need a proper , open debate			0
