by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 10 june 2013 planes powered by cow flatulence , luggage that floats on air and planes that harness passenger body heat could all one day be a possibility - if the engineers of tomorrow get their way			1
these are some of the shortlisted entries of the global @entity11 ' @entity12 - created to find eco-efficient ways that aviators can develop their fleets of planes in the future			1
each team will now present its ideas to a panel of @entity11 judges in @entity22 for a chance of winning £ 25,500 ( € 30,000 )			1
the team said that heat - sensitive material in cabin seats could be used to capture and store the energy from passengers			1
this energy could then be used to power the onboard electronics and reduce how much energy flights use an artist 's impression of what @entity40 , @entity42 from @entity44 's floating luggage hold could look like			0
the hold would be fitted with air jets , similar to those seen on air hockey tables			0
this would help airport workers slide luggage on and off planes more easily the shortlisted entry from @entity54 in @entity44 was floating luggage			2
using the principles of air hockey tables , the @entity56 entry involved retro - fitting a plane 's cargo hold with ' super-light sliding sections '			2
the sections would blow air that would make the cargo and luggage hover slightly off the ground			0
this would help airport workers to quickly , easily and safely load and unload luggage			0
@entity54 claim the technology could help passengers get their bags 30 per cent faster			2
the technology could also be fitted to the inside of planes to reduce the weight caused by the luggage in the hold , which in turn could reduce the amount of fuel used			1
@entity54 claim that their floating luggage technology could help passengers get their bags 30 % faster			2
it could also potentially be fitted to the inside of planes , to reduce the weight caused by the luggage in the hold , which in turn could reduce the amount of fuel used planes powered by cows , or more specifically , cow flatulence was submitted by @entity90 from @entity91			1
the plans would create a sustainable fuel that puts liquefied methane gas into ' specially - created supercooled pods ' that sit next to the engines			2
the team claim this solution could reduce co2 emissions by 97 per cent			2
@entity100 from @entity101 put forwarded the idea of a shape - shifting engine that would help reduce noise			1
the materials move and change shape when an electric current is applied to them			0
the team explained that the plans would involve ' a simple engine modification made from special shape - shifting materials can change airflow through the engine '			1
luggage floating on air - @entity54 from brazilusing the principles of air hockey , the cargo hold is retro - fitted with super-light sliding sections to enable workers to quickly , easily and safely load and unload luggage			0
passengers could get their bags 30 % faster and can start their holidays @entity124 powered by cows – @entity90 from @entity128 sustainable fuel solution puts liquefied methane to use in specially - created supercooled pods that sit next to the engines			1
the solution could reduce co2 emissions by 97 per cent.shape - shifting materials that help reduce noise – team @entity136 from @entity138 simple engine modification made from special shape - shifting materials can change airflow through the engine and reduce noise @entity142 - powered hybrid engines – team @entity144 from @entity145 - shaped rechargeable batteries drop into the cargo hold , helping to power efficient hybrid engines – only the required number of batteries are loaded dependent on mileage , optimizing the plane ’s weight			1
in a short - haul flight , this solution could save up to 60 per cent of fuel , which reduces up to 40 per cent of @entity158 body heat powering cabins – @entity27 from @entity161 a resting human body can be efficient – heat energy from specially - embedded heat - sensitive material in cabin seats captures energy from passengers			1
this energy could be used for onboard electronics , reducing the energy requirements for the flight			0
by changing the airflow , the amount of noise created by plane engines could be reduced			0
the battery - powered hybrid engines , from @entity175 @entity144 , would use rechargeable batteries fitted to the cargo hold			1
they would help the engine run on a mix of battery power and fuel and make the planes more power efficient			0
the team claim that only the required number of batteries would be loaded into the hold , dependent on mileage and this would ' optimise the plane ’s weight			0
' according to @entity144 , during a short - haul flight , its solution could save up to 60 per cent of fuel			0
this could also reduce up to 40 per cent of co2 emissions			0
finally , the human body heat powering cabins were submitted by @entity27 from @entity28			1
@entity136 from @entity101 submitted the idea for quieter engines			0
their plans involve making modifications to engines by adding shape - shifting materials			1
they could change the direction of airflow and make the engines more efficient and less noisy the shape - shifting materials that @entity136 want to put into plane engines can move and change shape when an electric current is passed through them			1
these materials could them change the airflow within the engines and reduce the amount of noise they make the team explained that even a resting human body can be efficient and heat energy from specially - embedded heat - sensitive material in cabin seats could store this energy from passengers			1
this energy could then be used for onboard electronics , reducing how much energy the flights would use			0
each team will now travel to @entity11 headquarters in @entity22 to compete for the £ 25,500 prize and present their ideas to a panel of judges			1
they were each assigned an @entity11 mentor to support their projects as well as an @entity11 expert in their chosen field			1
the competition was backed by the @entity240 ( @entity240 )			0
@entity241 , executive vice president engineering at @entity11 and @entity243 , said : ' these future - focused and disruptive concepts prove that engineering is n’t just about technical skills – it ’s about having an innovative mindset and a creative approach			1
@entity249 from @entity91 put forward the idea of planes being powered by methane gas			1
the pods shown in green on the left - hand image , and purple on the close - up , right - hand image would be fitted next to each engine			0
the pods would be temperature controlled to keep them cool and could turn liquefied methane into engine fuel ' but for our industry to succeed in making aviation carbon neutral by 2020 , we need a constant source of fresh and inventive ideas from the innovators of today and those of tomorrow			0
' our future solutions are here right now – and through projects like @entity243 , we are helping them to become a reality for the future			0
' he continued that such innovation may also be under threat from a skills gap that could be hitting the economy hard			0
team @entity144 from @entity175 suggested putting rechargeable batteries , pictured in green underneath the front and back of the plane , into a plane 's cargo hold to create power - efficient hybrid engines			2
the team claim that only the required number of batteries would be loaded to a planed dependent on mileage , optimising the plane 's weight companies face a shortfall of 40 million of the skilled workers needed by 2020 and beyond , with aerospace likely to suffer , along with motor and the medical equipment sectors			0
dr @entity300 , director of the @entity301 and @entity302 at @entity240 , said : ' if we ca n’t find ways to inspire a generation of engineers with varied skills , this is going to be a principle obstacle for growth in our slowly recovering global economy			2
' a recent @entity312 shows a marked shortage of engineers in many countries			0
an artist 's impression shows what @entity144 's rechargeable batteries may look like being fitted to an @entity11 plane			2
the @entity175 engineers behind the idea claim the technology could save up to 60 % of fuel during a short - haul flight , which reduces up to 40 % of @entity158 emissions ' although the general number of engineering students is increasing worldwide , the proportion who enroll in engineering , as compared to other disciplines , is concernedly dropping			2
' we need hands - on challenges like @entity40 to motivate young innovators about the potential of engineering in helping to find practical solutions to issues the world may face in the near future			1
' fly your ideas is part of the future by @entity11 , the company ’s vision of sustainable air travel in 2050			2
the winning team will be announced at an award ceremony in @entity352 on 14th june			1
