last year , @entity1 coo @entity0 encouraged all females on planet earth to achieve greatness with her book ' @entity5 ' - but managed to make most of us feel slightly pathetic in the process with her personal tales of achievement			1
this year , @entity11 life coach @entity10 comes to the party with a slightly less daunting variation on the theme			1
her newly launched book playing @entity16 , which has already received high praise stateside , promises to equip women with the practical tools to ' quiet self - doubt , find their voice and identify their dreams '			1
it 's no small promise but one which women 's leadership expert @entity10 believes is achievable			1
playing @entity16 , she says , is about helping women find their voice			1
reach for the sky : playing @entity16 by life coach @entity10 encourages women to ' quiet self - doubt , find their voice and identify their dreams ' ' five years ago , i began to see a pattern in my work : women with tremendous talent , ideas and aspiration often did n’t see their own brilliance , ' she says			1
' too often , they were sitting on their big ideas rather than sharing them , holding back their most provocative questions rather than asking them			0
' this is n't only a book for high - flying businesswomen , the ideas are as relevant to stay - at - home mums as they are for @entity48			2
it includes advice on how to quieten your inner critic , embrace fear and communicate with power			0
the author also believes we need to unleash our naughty schoolgirl in order to play big and has dedicated a chapter on how to drop ' good schoolgirl habits ' , like not showing off			1
but self - promotion , she points out , is a tricky balancing act for women			2
' research shows that women incur social costs for advocating for themselves too strongly ; they are seen as less likable by those around them , especially by other women , ' she says			0
' yet studies also show that women who do n’t advocate for themselves at all are not seen as competent leaders			0
there is a tricky middle ground to find			0
' playing @entity16 , by @entity10 ( left ) , is aimed at stay - at - home mums and @entity48 alike so how do we find this illusive point between allowing ourselves to be overlooked and coming across big - headed ? @entity10 's first piece of advice is to drop the idea of ' self - promotion ' and think about the concept of visibility			1
' when you shift the frame to visibility , you ’ll notice it ’s not all about you			0
instead , it becomes about making your work and ideas available to those who can utilize them , ' says @entity10			2
she also advises telling the whole truth			0
' women tell many little lies - lies of omission - about their accomplishments ' she says			2
' for many women , it ’s helpful to think about “ telling the whole truth ” rather than about self - promoting , ' traditional schooling gives women many important skills , but it does n’t teach many of those most essential for leadership , ' she says			2
' as women transition from student mode to career , they must add to their tool kit : the ability to challenge authority , the ability to improvise , the ability to draw on and trust what they already know and the ability to make their work visible to others			0
' the author has won praise from high - profile women including @entity125 , who describes the book as ' inspirational '			1
another fan , author of @entity128 , @entity129 , says of the book : ' i hope it will empower legions of women to step into their greatness			1
i could n’t be happier about this publication			0
' so what are you waiting for ? ... greatness awaits .			0
