by @entity0 @entity1 appears like a black hole in a sea of light in this remarkable @entity6 satellite image of the isolated communist state			1
taken at night on january 30 from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) this picture shows @entity1 almost completely devoid of lights			1
in stark contrast to the south of the image @entity14 is shown bathed in light as is @entity16 to the north both clearly visible bustling with energy			0
the image , taken from the @entity9 earlier this year , shows @entity1 as a swathe of dark ground between @entity16 in the north and @entity14 @entity1 - which is ruled by supreme leader @entity24 - is almost completely black appearing to show a distinct lack of power or energy supply			1
the only exception is the country 's capital @entity31 to the south east of the nation which is illuminated by city lights			1
however the rest of the country - which has a population of 24 million - is pitch black looking almost like a sea between @entity14 and @entity16			2
the @entity41 website commented on the photograph : ' @entity1 is almost completely dark compared to neighbouring @entity14 and @entity16			2
' the darkened land appears as if it were a patch of water joining the @entity46 to the @entity47			0
' its capital city , @entity31 , appears like a small island , despite a population of 3.26 million ( as of 2008 )			1
the light emission from @entity31 is equivalent to the smaller towns in @entity14			2
' coastlines are often very apparent in night imagery , as shown by @entity14 's eastern shoreline			0
but the coast of @entity1 is difficult to detect			0
' these differences are illustrated in per capita power consumption in the two countries , with @entity14 at 10,162 kilowatt hours and @entity1 at 739 kilowatt hours			2
' illuminating : only @entity1 's show - piece capital city of @entity31 appears bright against the darkness the image was released today as it emerged @entity24 was rumoured to be expecting his second child after his wife appeared in public in a maternity dress			1
speculation mounted after onlookers noticed @entity71 wearing what appeared to be the same loose - fitting outfit she wore before the birth of their daughter in late 2012			0
@entity24 , 31 , who is believed to also have a daughter with another woman , will be desperately hoping for a male heir to continue the family 's dictatorship			0
