@entity0 has worked diligently to get her figure back to peak condition since the birth of her second son in may , and the results speak for themselves			1
but while the 27 - year - old 's earlier physical transformations have largely been down to hard work in the gym , this time round @entity0 has had a bit of a helping hand at a local clinic			1
the @entity15 wife of @entity16 has revealed that she has been undergoing 3d lipo - a £ 999 treatment that claims to melt fat away			1
slimmer frame : @entity0 has been displaying a more svelte figure lately and now she has revealed the secret behind it : @entity25 lipo the mother - of - two revealed on @entity27 : ' started my 3d lipo course today @ @entity30			1
thanks girls , enjoyed the treatment xx '			2
her message , which has since been deleted , was retweeted by the @entity15 - based salon and uploaded to their @entity37 page			1
the treatment , which is on offer exclusively at @entity40 in @entity0 's northern hometown , is also favoured by fellow @entity42 , @entity43			1
it combines @entity45 , which converts fat cells into liquid which can then be naturally drained by the body 's own filtration system , as well as a body sculpting treatment called @entity51			1
revealed : the mother - of - two revealed on @entity27 : ' started my 3d lipo course today @ @entity30			2
thanks girls , enjoyed the treatment xx ' , which @entity56 salons uploaded to their @entity37 page speaking to @entity57 , @entity58 , joint salon director of @entity40 , where @entity0 has been receiving the treatment , said : ' @entity0 heard about the system through our other clients in her circle of friends			1
' she contacted us about it and we invited her in for an in - depth consultation about what she wanted to achieve			0
hotting up : the 3d system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat , which is excreted through the liver			2
it also helps tighten the skin , claims @entity58 who has the device in her salon ' she 's been coming in for about four weeks now for the full treatment			1
' the 3d system heats skin up to 41 degrees and melts the fat , which is excreted through the liver			2
it also helps tighten the skin			0
' the new system , which claims to give ' instant results ' of 5 - 6cm loss per session , also maintains that there is no downtime			2
dr @entity90 , cosmetic doctor at @entity91 , said : ' in recent months we have seen the emergence of many non-invasive treatments such as this one			0
' however , since this is a non-invasive procedure , which does not involve physically extracting the fat from the body , the operator does not have much control over how much fat is removed			2
' with procedures where the fat is physically removed however , such as @entity106 liposuction , the surgeon has control over where , to what extent and how much fat is removed			0
the areas can also be contoured with extraction techniques			0
' it is necessary to ask the question , " if fat is not actually being removed from the body , where is it going ? " blitz : the mother - of - two recently revealed she uses @entity120 - a fat - blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach tweet tweet : @entity0 tweeted about using the machine , which was recommended to her by personal trainer , @entity126 ' i would also advise that patients who , like @entity0 , have recently given birth , wait some time before opting to undergo any form of procedure which seeks to target body fat			1
' with pregnancy , weight gain is an inevitability and so the body needs time to re-adjust after birth			0
' diet and exercise are , first and foremost , the most important methods of weight loss post-pregnancy			0
in time , a cosmetic procedure to target stubborn areas of excess fat may well be suitable , but i would advise the patient to wait until their weight has stabilised before undergoing such a procedure			1
' this is n't the first time that @entity0 has experimented with weight loss methods to shift the pounds			1
in june she revealed that she got in shape for a friend 's wedding by embarking on a gruelling juice diet and has also admitted to using @entity156 - a fat - blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach after giving birth to baby @entity160			0
pregnant : @entity0 ( pictured here just before giving birth to @entity160 in may ) has certainly got her figure back @entity162 , 47 , had @entity163 because he said he ' did n't have time to exercise '			1
the businessman from @entity166 , who has two children , had 11 treatments which cost £ 45 a session			2
he told @entity57 : ' i used to be 17st and dropped two stone after changing my diet and cutting out carbs			0
but i still had fat around my middle that i could n't shift			0
i could n't restrict my diet anymore and as i 'm always working , i did n't have time to exercise			0
@entity162 , left , said @entity163 helped him banish his love handles			0
pictured right , his stomach before ( top ) and after treatments ' so i tried this instead as each session does n't take long and it 's not an invasive procedure			0
' since having the treatment , @entity162 said his waist measurements have shrunk from 44/46 inches to 34 inches			0

@entity0 tweeted about first session of the fat melting treatment
costs £ 999 for eight sessions and clinic claims no *recovery* time needed
