but then , most wives do n’t have a footwear collection worth $ 1million ( £ 640,000 )			1
hedge fund manager @entity11 is suing his ex-wife , @entity12 , for 35 per cent of all the shoes she owns , claiming she kept them hidden as they thrashed out a $ 3.25million ( £ 2m ) divorce settlement			1
surrounded : @entity17 with some of her 1,200 pairs of designer heels			1
she claims it was an obsession bordering on illness @entity12 and her daughter admiring the collection substitute for love : mrs @entity17 said ' there was such a lack of emotion and love in my relationship that i filled that void with shopping ... i could n't stop ' mr @entity11 alleges she hoarded the 1,200 pairs – more than half of which are by @entity37 – in a ‘ secret room ’ in their exclusive apartment			1
but mrs @entity17 , a professional poker player , branded her ex-husband ’s move as harassment , said he must have known about the shoes – and vowed to ‘ fight him all the way ’			1
the couple , who have three children together , split up in 2009			0
mr @entity11 remained in their $ 7.4million apartment , which he has since sold for a $ 200,000 profit			2
last year , however , he lost a reported $ 7million on the gold market			2
he has now filed the lawsuit against his ex-wife			1
it states : ‘ in the summer of 2011 , @entity0 became aware that @entity12 owned and failed to disclose an extensive … collection of @entity37 shoes … and other high - end designer shoes			1
@entity12 is working on her new shoe website , @entity59 , which was inspired by her new boyfriend @entity60 ‘ @entity61 trusted his wife and was not inspecting his home to try to find inventory or “ secret rooms ’ ’			0
’ the collection is indeed vast and includes 700 pairs of @entity68 , costing from $ 700 to $ 4,000			1
that , combined with her reputation as a @entity73 poker player , has made mrs @entity17 something of a celebrity in the @entity76 she has appeared on television to discuss her shoe habit , and is starting to design her own range of footwear			1
the 42 - year - old ’s devotion to @entity37 is such that she has described his creations as ‘ fine art ’ and even has a tattoo of one of his heels			2
the collection includes dozens of pairs of strappy silver sandals , black kitten heels and leopard print pumps , all in her own size seven ( @entity96 size 4 )			1
@entity12 and her staggering collection have featured on @entity98 and the today show mrs @entity17 ’s most expensive shoes are a pair of black and white cowboy boots once owned by @entity103			1
she keeps them in a glass cabinet of their own with a framed picture of the actress on the wall above , although she refused to reveal how much they cost			0
she now lives in a luxurious house near @entity112 with her two youngest children @entity114 , 17 , and @entity115 , 15 – and has four storage areas around the property for all her footwear			0
the main closet , which can only be entered using a numerical keypad , is 12ft by 8ft and has eight racks , each full of shoes , going from the floor to the ceiling			2
a second room also has a numerical keypad and is 4ft by 5ft			0
there is also a separate rack in another room , where she keeps her formal shoes , and another cupboard for the remainder			2
@entity17 with her boyfriend @entity60 , 36 and part of her shoe collection @entity12 's collection features 700 @entity37 heels ranging from $ 400 - $ 7,000 a glitzy pair of @entity37 heels are one of @entity12 's favourites mrs @entity17 claims she has always funded her habit with her poker winnings , although by some counts she has won only $ 500,000 during her six years in the game			1
she said : ‘ there are shoes that i do n’t even remember buying			0
i ’m so short of space i had to give a couple of hundred pairs away			0
‘ sometimes i pull a pair out that i do n’t remember and feel like i got a pair of shoes for free			0
’ she added that it would be ‘ ludicrous ’ if she had actually kept her habit a secret from her husband when they shared the apartment in @entity160			0
‘ i ’m shaking my head over this whole thing , ’ she said			0
‘ he is saying he did n’t know the closet in our master bedroom existed			0
’ @entity11 believes the value of the collection may entitle him to hundreds of thousands of dollars more in their divorce settlement new home : mrs @entity17 has moved into this new home in @entity112 , @entity173			1
her shoes are in special closets that require a pin code to enter asked if she has become addicted , she said : ‘ i do n’t have an addiction to shoes because they ’re a want , and definitely not a need			0
