a gay couple has won the right to be recognised as the legal parents of twin boys after the surrogate mother they paid to carry them disappeared			1
the woman , believed to be living in the state of @entity7 , @entity8 , handed over the boys last year without giving her formal consent to the handover			2
the couple arranged to pay a @entity14 clinic £ 17,000 to become the children 's parents under a commercial surrogacy agreement in 2010			1
but after the babies were born in @entity8 the following year , the surrogate mother did not formally give consent for them to be treated as the @entity23 couple 's children			1
application : the couple , who can not be named , went to the @entity26 in @entity27 to obtain parental orders after they failed to trace their children 's natural mother the men were in a legal limbo until tuesday , when mr justice @entity34 granted them ' parental orders ' after hearing that they had taken ' all reasonable steps ' to find the anonymous donor			1
it is believed to be the first time that a court in @entity43 or @entity44 has made such an order without the consent of a birth mother			2
the couple , who can not be named for legal reasons , have been bringing up the babies since their birth in july 2011 and now have the authority to continue			0
the judge said that there were lessons to be learned after hearing how the couple entered into the surrogacy agreement with the clinic and the mother in 2010			1
an ' anonymous @entity8 egg donor ' was selected and one of the men was the ' genetic father '			0
the judge said the couple agreed to pay about £ 17,000 for the ' entire package of treatment and costs '			1
before the twins were born , the couple ’s lawyers wrote to the director of the clinic pointing out the need for the surrogate mother to give consent to parental orders			1
the director replied that the clinic ' would be happy to be of help '			0
the judge said after the boys were born , the couple received a document purportedly signed by the surrogate mother and a doctor			1
the woman is believed to come from the state of @entity7 , the capital of which is @entity14 ( pictured ) the document said the surrogate mother had no objections to the provision of the boys ’ exit visas			1
mr justice @entity34 said the couple ' assumed responsibility ' for the babies two days after their birth and left @entity8 without the surrogate mother giving signed consent to parental orders			1
the judge said one of the men emailed the director of the clinic setting a ' deadline ' for the production of the mother ’s signed consent			1
three days later they received a package , purportedly from the director , containing a sheet of paper with an ' obscene gesture ' printed on it			0
the couple then asked an ' inquiry agent ' to try to find the surrogate mother - but without success			2
in his ruling , the judge said : ' it is a very important element of the surrogacy law in this country that a parental order should normally only be made with the consent of the woman who carried and gave birth to the child			2
' the reasons for this provision are obvious			0
a surrogate mother is not merely a cipher			2
' she plays the most important role in bringing the child into the world			0
she is a " natural parent " of the child ... ' the act of carrying and giving birth to a baby establishes a relationship with the child which is one of the most important relationships in life			0
' it is therefore not surprising that some surrogate mothers find it impossible to part with their babies and give consent to the parental order			2
' the judge continued : ' i accept that these applicants have taken all reasonable steps to obtain the woman ’s consent			0
' if it is correct that she is living in the state of @entity7 , then she is one of many millions of women living in that state and there is in my judgment no realistic hope of finding her			0
' i accept that it is not the applicants ’ fault that they found themselves in this position			0
' i am satisfied that they reasonably believed that the clinic and its staff would behave responsibly			0
' it seems that they and the twins have been badly let down			0
