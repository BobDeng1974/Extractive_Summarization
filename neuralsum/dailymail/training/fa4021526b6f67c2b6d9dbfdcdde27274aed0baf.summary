his daughter , who is now 25 , says the attack never happened - and that she lied because her drug - addict mother forced to beat her unless she said her father abused her			1
@entity12 , who has battled the courts to release her father ever since recanting her accusations the following year , penned a series of apologetic letters to him			1
scroll down for @entity26 ' mistake ' : @entity28 , who is now 25 , said she falsely accused her @entity10 veteran father of raping her as a nine - year - old because her mother threatened to beat her if she did n't but now it appears her father has lost his review and after a thorough investigation , the @entity34 has determined that @entity9 was not wrongfully convicted			1
' i ’m absolutely devastated , ' said alleged victim @entity28 , who first told her story to @entity38 in august			1
' my father did n’t rape me , and i do n’t know why they just wo n’t believe me			1

' one of the individuals interviewed by the state committee sent @entity93 a letter saying the report contains ' misleading and inaccurate quotes , ' and an expert he hired sent @entity93 a letter calling the committee ’s rejection of @entity12 ’s recantation ' unscientific			2
' battle : @entity9 , pictured in prison , tired to use apologetic letters written by his daughter to secure his release but failed in his attempt the district attorney association ’s report lists various reasons to support its conclusion that @entity83 is guilty : - a judge evaluated the same evidence 15 years ago and has already decided the recantation was n’t credible			1

- most of all , the report claims that despite @entity12 ’s insistence that she was n’t raped , her story is not credible , saying she ' can neither explain why she falsely advanced such a horrible allegation , nor why she adhered to it for so long and repeated it to so many different people			1
' @entity141 , @entity9 ’s original trial attorney in 1999 , is quoted extensively in the @entity143 report , suggesting that @entity9 might be guilty and that the case against him was strong			2

according to ms @entity28 her mother threatened to beat her if she did not ' tell me the answer that i want to hear '			1
she said she told her mother her father had molested her to avoid being beaten , even though it was n't true			2
@entity9 was taken in for questioning on october 29 1997			2
there was no definitive forensic evidence to prove @entity12 had been raped , but the little girl and her mother 's story - together with some suspect answers @entity9 provided during questioning - were enough for officers to charge the father of five			1
he refused a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole in six years , and within a year was sentenced to up to 40 years following a trial by jury			0

@entity249 said that he believed @entity12 ’s recantation , say there was ' no corroborative evidence of the alleged abuse			0
' he cited the lack of psychological trauma , the consistency of her recantation over time , and the lack of grooming of the alleged victim by the perpetrator			0
' “ to a reasonable degree of medical certainty @entity266 ’s recantation of her allegation her father sexually abused her when she was 8 years of age is not only credible but true , ' wrote @entity249			0
' the basic scenario leaves more than reasonable doubt that the child was sexually abused by her father			0
