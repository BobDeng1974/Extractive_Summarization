a teenage boy who stood before his @entity2 church and made a heartbreaking plea for someone to adopt him has finally found the loving family he has always craved			1
@entity6 only , 16 , had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars			1
three years after his emotional plea at @entity13 in @entity14 he has finally found a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven - year - old when she became his caseworker			2
on april 22 she will officially become @entity6 's mother			1
she admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family , but she said it was worth it			1
since august , @entity6 has been spending weekends with @entity24 and her daughters , @entity41 , 21 , @entity28 , 17 , and with her adopted son @entity29 , who is now 14			1
then in december , going took the steps to begin the adoption process and @entity6 moved with the rest of the family into a larger home			1
since then there have fights and tables have been flipped , but in the end everyone loves one another , and she is prepared for the challenges			0
' i 'm okay with messy and difficult , ' she told the @entity55			0
' you just have to have your armor on all the time , but it 's more than worth it			0
and every day things get a little bit better			0
' @entity6 became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church : ' my name is @entity6 and i 've been in foster care since i was born			1
i know @entity71 has n't given up on me , so i 'm not giving up either			0
' he then said : ' i 'll take anyone			0
old or young , dad or mom , black , white , purple			0
and i would be really appreciative			0
the best i could be			0
' @entity6 only , 16 , has been adopted by his old case worker , @entity24 going in @entity2 ( above )			1
she has known the teen since he was seven years old			0
@entity6 had been in the foster care system his entire life @entity6 ( above ) captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a @entity14 church congregation for a family to ' love him forever ' most of all , @entity6 said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever '			1
millions of people around the country soon heard about @entity6 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by @entity93 on @entity94 , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in @entity96 and his family			1
that is until @entity6 got into a fight with one of the other children , and the minister sent him back to @entity2 , and back to live in the foster care system			2
after @entity6 returned , people kept asking going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months			2
' that boy spent his whole life in the system , that 's what went wrong , ' she said			0
making matters worse , @entity6 and miss @entity24 , as he calls her , did not speak when he came back to @entity2			0
@entity6 had cut himself off from other people , playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year			0
@entity6 only ( pictured above with @entity24 going at the church where he made his speech in 2013 ) was adopted by a minister in @entity96 but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister 's children going says she had begun to call him numerous times , but he always hung up the phone			1
then , one night last july , @entity6 called up miss @entity24 and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy			2
' do you remember what i asked you before ? ' he said			0
' well , how do you feel about adopting me now ? ' for the first time since he had asked , going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear			0
the 52 - year - old case worker has three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer @entity6 's case worker , which made the process easier			1
from august through december he started spending more and more time with the family , a perfect fit as he was already close to going 's adopted son @entity29			2
then , in december , going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting @entity6			2
@entity6 only ( pictured above in church three years ago ) called and asked miss @entity24 if she would adopt him last july @entity6 got his first bedroom , his first set of siblings , and , most importantly , the one thing he had been hoping for all along			0
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity6 said to going last december			2
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' @entity6 officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers			1
after 16 years @entity6 was finally home			2
what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when @entity6 stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well			1
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity6 ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december			1
