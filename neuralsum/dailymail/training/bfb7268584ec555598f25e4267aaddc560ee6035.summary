by @entity1 reporter if history tells us anything , when a white person dresses in blackface for any reason , it will almost always end in some sort of racially insensitive disaster - especially if you 're a politician , an actor , or , in the case of @entity15 , a school board member in @entity16			1
a photo surfaced last week that shows @entity15 , the @entity18 representative to the @entity19 , dressed as @entity21 tennis phenom @entity20			1
according to @entity15 , the outfit was for a @entity23 she went to nearly five years ago			1
@entity15 's costume is complete with a tennis racket , a poofy black wig and a pink tennis outfit - as well as a brown turtleneck presumably to represent @entity20 ' dark skin and brown face - paint reminiscent of @entity31 in @entity32			2
blackface : @entity16 school board member @entity15 wore this ' @entity20 costume ' to a @entity36 party about five years ago blackface is often deemed offensive because of its implied stereotypical caricature of @entity21			1
@entity41 associate professor @entity40 explained why blackface is almost always deemed offensive in an article published on the website @entity46 ' blackface minstrelsy first became nationally popular in the late 1820s when white male performers portrayed @entity21 - @entity21 characters using burnt cork to blacken their skin			0
wearing tattered clothes , the performances mocked black behavior , playing racial stereotypes for laughs , ' @entity52 wrote in her article			0
recently , @entity60 personality @entity61 earned some negative headlines when she attended a @entity23 dressed in blackface , and @entity66 @entity65 assemblyman @entity64 also was criticized when a photo of him in blackface was discovered by the media			2
and on wednesday , @entity15 became the latest to be criticized for what many consider to be an offensive costume when an article was printed in the @entity73 that showed her in her @entity20 costume			2
colleagues say @entity15 does n't have a racist bone in her body , but agree that the costume was not the best choice ' there was absolutely no ill - intent , ' @entity15 told @entity82 on friday			2
' i am an avid tennis fan and player ( i play several times a week )			0
@entity20 is my favorite player			0
' the photo , which appeared on her @entity87 page , was removed after the image was published by the newspaper and the public began to weigh in on her choice of costume - she says she removed the photo because of the ' increased media attention			0
' @entity96 , who also is a member of the school board , says he spoke with @entity15 and believes that she truly regrets the photo			1
' i would n't have done it , ' said @entity96 in an interview with @entity82 , calling the costume a bad choice			0
' i do n't think there is a racist bone in her body , ' he added			0
@entity15 is running for re-election to her post on the school board , and @entity96 thinks the photo may have emerged now as her opponents are trying to discredit her candidacy .			1
