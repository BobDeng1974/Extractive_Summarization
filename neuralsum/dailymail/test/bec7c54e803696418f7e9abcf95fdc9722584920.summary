@entity0 will be onto a winner no matter what happens on saturday night			1
the 30 - year - old arrived in @entity4 on a crest of a wave , a newly crowned world champion eager to lap up the first defence of the title he won so superbly before @entity10			1
and his future took the most unexpected of twists on friday night after @entity14 @entity13 , the undefeated former @entity15 middleweight champion , failed to make required 160 lbs weight ensuring the battle at the @entity18 will have no title on the line			1
@entity0 ( left ) lines up with ( @entity22 ) @entity23 , @entity24 and his opponent @entity13 in @entity4 @entity0 's bout on saturday will no longer be a title fight after @entity13 failed to make the 160lb weight @entity0 was hoping to make his first defence of the @entity15 middleweight title he won against @entity31 last year @entity0 works out with trainer @entity32 at the @entity18 ahead of his showdown with @entity13 @entity13 says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line @entity13 , who had been out for a year , initially hit the scales at 161.9 and despite a quick run and hope session on the treadmill saw him register 160.6 , it was not enough			1
naturally , the @entity43 still wants to impress , especially with the event screened live on @entity45 to an expected audience of millions			1
yet when the bells goes , he knows nothing can destroy his own title dream			1
' he came back onto the scales and in the end it was just too much for him to lose , ' said trainer @entity32			2
' you can lose three pounds in a short space of time but it did n't happen			2
@entity0 still has to go out and do a job			1
' i think he knew he was n't going to make the weight but he still tried			1
he lost 0.8 of a pound knowing that he was n't going to make it			2
he tried his arse off			2
' he could n't make it			2
that 's not our problem			2
all @entity0 can do is his job			1
and his job is to make weight professionally			1
to be fit , strong and ready for everything that can happen in this fight – and he is			1
' ' i am still happy that i can fight @entity0 but it is disappointing , ' added a dejected @entity13 who had not fought for a year after vacating his belt to tend to his dying uncle , a factor which clearly worked against him when aiming to reach the desired fighting weight			1
' i did n't want to let down any of my fans or family who wanted me to get my title back			1
this wo n't effect my confidence			2
nothing will break me and i will always stay in the eye of the storm			2
' the @entity43 took his world title chance by beating @entity31 for the @entity15 middleweight title the 30 - year - old admits he may have retired from boxing had he not beaten @entity88 in june last year @entity0 celebrates his world title win in december providing @entity0 comes through unscathed , @entity91 's @entity90 is the mandatory challenger - while a lucrative fight against @entity94 legend @entity93 is also a potential option			1
it was two hours of unexpected drama but no matter – it simply means @entity0 has even longer to bask in the spotlight			1
what a difference 10 months makes			2
last summer 30 year - old @entity43 was struggling to get a shot at the big time			2
the end of his career was lurching into view			2
trainer @entity32 sat the man from @entity108 down and laid it on the line			0
if @entity88 was n't beaten , and beaten well , it could have been time to call it a day			0
not only was @entity88 superbly put to the sword , he then went on to scoop the big one			0
a brilliant flurry of right hands in @entity116 before @entity10 sent the previously unbeaten @entity31 crashing and the new @entity15 middleweight champion of the world was crowned			1
it was just desserts for an underrated fighter who chiseled his inner grit , strength and dynamism on the mean streets of @entity127 under the legendary guidance of @entity129 in his famous @entity131 gym			0
on saturday comes the chance to take another huge bite out of the @entity134 and back up promoter @entity136 's claims that the @entity43 warrior is a superstar in the making			0
@entity13 , who boasts a record of 31 - 0 with 22 ko 's says his 12 months out of competitive action have seen him adopt a new found freshness and desire which should ensure one hell of a tussle at what should be a rocking @entity18 in @entity147			1
there is a permanent glint in his eye			0
@entity0 , though , is ready			1
' @entity151 ( left ) , pictured with @entity152 , has not been beaten in 31 professional fights @entity0 's next fight could be a lucrative contest against legendary @entity94 @entity93 ( right ) ' i have lived and fought in the @entity14 for years so this holds absolutely no fears for me			1
some fighters from the @entity160 may look at coming to the @entity161 and be thinking what a big platform it is and that could weigh on their mind , ' he said			0
' i do n't have those problems			0
@entity127 was a tough school to learn my trade			0
the gym was a ' kill or be killed atmosphere			0
' there was no regard for reputation and you had to prove yourself every day			0
' i have fought in tough gyms before but this was the toughest			0
it 's not just about the technical aspects , people there are trying to knock your head off			0
' i was the @entity183 of the gym but it has helped me become the fighter i am			0
there would be young lads ready to have a go but i took it all			0
competition like that breeds success			0
' i am sure he has trained well but activity is an important thing for a fighter and could be a factor			0
i am not banking on him being rusty but when you are fighting and making weight regularly , everything comes more naturally			1
being as active as i have been is an advantage for me			0
' if it had n't gone to plan against @entity88 we would have had to make some tough decisions			0
boxing is a hard game and it 's tough way to make a living			0
i am so proud to be an @entity43 from @entity108 defending my title in @entity4			1
' it does n't get much better than this			0
' @entity215 ( right ) has been holed up with @entity0 in @entity216 ahead of the big fight on saturday holing up with @entity32 in @entity216 has got @entity0 in tune for the biggest night of his life			1
' looking back , did i think it was going to happen for him ? no , ' admitted the man who helped @entity222 become world champion			0
' i knew he would be able to win a title but it 's whether or not that opportunity would have ever come up			1
' the pressure of him achieving something has been lifted and he 's expressing himself like never before			0
it 's a joy to watch .			0
