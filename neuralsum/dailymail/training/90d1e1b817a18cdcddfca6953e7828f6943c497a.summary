but demonstrating the more positive power of social media , in august a @entity23 teenager who tweeted about planning to commit suicide was helped by concerned internet users from all over the world - potentially saving her life			2
and now new research has shown that @entity7 reflects trends in suicide surprisingly accurately and as such could be harnessed as a preventative force			2
researchers at the @entity34 , @entity35 , found the number of ‘ suicidal tweets ’ in each area strongly correlated with the real suicide rate			1
they examined millions of tweets in @entity41 over a three month period and found the rate of worrying tweets in each state strongly correlated with that states actual suicide rate			0
the researchers found 37,717 troubling tweets , which mentioned suicide or key words associated with bullying which is known to be a risk factor , from 28,088 users over the three months			1
