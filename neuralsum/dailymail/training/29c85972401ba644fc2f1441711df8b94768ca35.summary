by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 5 september 2012 @entity1 has launched an extraordinary attack on @entity3 and claimed that she is ‘ getting too thin ’			1
the tv show host said that the @entity3 needed to put on some weight - or she might not have her as a guest on her new programme			1
@entity1 also renewed her attack on her former employers at @entity11 and said she should have been ‘ more circumspect ’ about working with the company			1
her comments about the @entity3 are likely to cause outrage at @entity15 which granted her extensive access to the royal family during a recent special for @entity19 , where is a special correspondent			1
battle of the @entity21 : @entity1 ( right ) said that the @entity3 ( left ) would be her dream guest but then went on to criticize her figure she made them during the filming of the first episode of her new chat show @entity28 in response to audience questions about who her dream guest would be			1
@entity1 said that @entity3 would be her choice but there was one issue : ‘ i think she 's getting too thin			1
’ @entity3 reportedly lost 10lbs and went from a size eight to a size six in the weeks before her marriage to prince @entity40 in order to fit into her wedding dress			1
she was reportedly on the @entity43 which limits those on it to just protein like fish during the first , most brutal stage			0
this is not the first time @entity3 ’s weight has come us as other commentators have raised concerns she may be getting too thin , especially if she wants to have a baby			1
uncharted access : @entity1 had a tour of the royal gardens during her earlier interview with prince @entity40 ' too thin ' : @entity3 's weight has been a topic of constant talk as she lost an alleged 10 pounds before her wedding the @entity62 has also been sensitive to weight issues since 1995 when princess @entity64 publicly admitted that she suffered from bulimia and made herself vomit after eating			1
when interviewer @entity66 asked her what the @entity67 thought of her problems , @entity64 replied : ‘ they thought it was a waste of food ’			0
speaking to @entity73 , @entity1 also laid into @entity11 again where she hosted the @entity74 for five years before leaving under acrimonious circumstances			2
@entity1 had claimed that working there left her she felt ‘ constrained ’ and that departing was like being ‘ liberated ’			2
in her latest interview she said : ‘ ultimately i 'm very proud of the work i did , but really tinkering with the format of a newscast might have been more difficult than initially thought by everyone			0
rare : the princes grant infrequent interviews so it was considered a ' get ' when @entity1 was able to sit down with both royal audience : during the jubilee , @entity1 met the @entity88 at a garden party ‘ in hindsight i probably should have examined that more carefully : could you really change the format in a way that it would capitalize on my particular skill set , which is doing interviews , interacting , being more spontaneous , being a little more casual			2
former love : @entity1 split from her 17 - years - junior boyfriend @entity98 in december ‘ nobody has a crystal ball , but i wish i 'd been a little more circumspect about the possibility of doing that			2
’ @entity1 - who is famous for her controlled public image - added that even though she expects her chat show guests to open up , she will not be doing so herself			1
she said : ‘ only when it 's relevant and only when it 's a natural part of the conversation			0
‘ if we 're talking about dating over 50 , i might say what my attitude is about it			0
i 'm not going to talk about the date i had the night before			0
‘ i want to talk about my own experiences , but i do n't want to overshare			0
’ one of those experiences was her five - year relationship with @entity98 , a man 17 years her junior			0
they broke up in december of last year , but the stigma of older women dating younger men has clearly stuck with her			0
in the same @entity73 article , @entity1 is quoted talking with @entity124 winner @entity123 who is currently dating a much younger man after splitting with her long - time partner @entity126			2
' i wonder if that bugs you as much as it bugs me , ' @entity1 said of the fact that their is no true male equivalent for the addage ' cougar ' that both women had been labeled with for their respective relationships			0
they settled on ' sugar daddies ' in the end .			0

@entity1 said her ultimate guest on her coming show would be @entity3
comments over the @entity3 ' weight will likely anger @entity148 *representatives* because @entity1 was granted *unbridled* access to them during the @entity150
