so where would you start ? you have been thrust into the role of @entity4 manager and your first task is to fill the void created by @entity8 ’s departure to @entity9			1
sitting in the club bank account is £ 75million and you are free to go and spend it			1
with supporters clamouring for a new hero , you will assume you need to find a replacement with a similar standing to @entity8 , someone who screams box office			2
how about @entity18 , then ? fresh from a positive @entity20 and winning the @entity21 with @entity22 , his class as a striker can not be questioned			2
when he recovers from the ankle ligament damage that cost him a place in @entity42 ’s @entity20 winning - squad , there is no doubt he deserves a place in @entity47 football ’s ‘ a ’ list			0
others would have to be considered			0
why not @entity49 , a striker who deserves to be playing in front of a bigger , more passionate crowd than @entity52 's ? @entity53 from @entity54 , maybe ? @entity55 , or even @entity56 ? were @entity4 to land any of the aforementioned players , the news would be huge , the fee would be massive but , more than anything , the deal would represent a shift in a policy that goes back to the days of @entity64			1
@entity4 , in the main , do not raid big clubs to sign big names – they identify talent and turn them into stars			1
fitting the @entity70 : @entity64 's way of developing talent is still practised at @entity4 that has always been the preferred way			2
@entity75 may have become a dual @entity27 later in his career but he arrived at @entity77 in 1971 as an unheralded rookie from @entity79 , all fierce determination and boundless enthusiasm			0
playing in a fine team , having a desire to squeeze every last ounce of his ability and benefitting from the guidance of two uniquely gifted managers helped propel him to stardom			0
@entity75 blossomed on @entity90 , he did n’t come as the ready - made package			0
similar sentiments apply to many others			0
@entity94 had been brilliant for @entity95 but moving to @entity4 , where he crowned his first season with the goal that retained the @entity21 , enabled him to scale completely new heights while dramatically enhancing his reputation			2
packing a punch : @entity75 lands a right hook on @entity103 captain @entity102 in the 1974 @entity104 you can go on reeling off examples : @entity107 and @entity108 ; @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity8 – all had @entity4 to thank for providing the stage to bloom			1
none first wore a red shirt at the peak of their powers			0
it has never been @entity4 ’s way to do , say , what @entity122 have done and buy @entity124 for in excess of £ 30m with huge wages from another @entity47 powerhouse and it certainly wo n’t be the way under @entity129 , as the ethos and economics do n’t match			1
so while the idea of going out and bidding for a name that would get plastered all over the back pages sounds romantic to supporters , there is little chance @entity137 , his transfer committee or @entity129 will consider doing just that			1
forward thinking : manager @entity137 shares the philosophy of the clubs and its owners @entity137 , for one , knows exactly what he is looking for in the players he signs			1
last summer , when the window was closing , he was considering his options when the name of a @entity21 winning player was put to him during a casual discussion			0
he nodded his head about this player ’s ability and pedigree but then asked the question : ‘ would he now want to run through a wall for you every day ? ’ that is what @entity137 wants : youth , energy , hunger ; players with desire to get to the top and keep improving on the way , players such as @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity168 – a player whom @entity165 extensively scouted last season – and @entity167			2
new arrival : @entity177 midfielder @entity171 has joined from @entity178 on the radar : @entity181 's young @entity180 striker @entity167 is on @entity137 ' shortlist of course there is respect for the big names , those who have been around and seen all there is to see , but @entity137 is a manager who , primarily , wants his squad filled with individuals who are careering towards their peak , not those who are established and already had that experience			1
‘ the idea is to have that squad in place by the end of august and it is going to be a really exciting time for us , ’ @entity137 said recently			2
we ’ve got a lot of young players who will have gained from the experience last season			0
i ’m looking forward to seeing the development of the team			0
’ which is why , then , he will take a measured approach to spending that @entity8 bounty , rather than just heading for the names that only vast , vast sums could buy			1
@entity4 set to seal double signing			0

@entity8 has left @entity4 to join @entity9 for £ 75million
@entity53 , @entity34 and @entity18 among big names to be linked with @entity215
@entity4 have *traditionally* bought small and *concentrated* on development
owners @entity129 and manager @entity137 share that philosophy
