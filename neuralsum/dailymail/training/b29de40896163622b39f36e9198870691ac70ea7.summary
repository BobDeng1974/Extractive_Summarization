by @entity0 @entity1 are keeping a watching brief on @entity4 goalkeeper @entity3			1
@entity1 goalkeeping coach @entity5 was in the stands for @entity4 's win over @entity8 10 days ago where 26 - year - old @entity3 kept a clean sheet			1
the @entity10 1 was the subject of strong interest from sir @entity13 a year ago but the upturn in @entity16 's form meant a £ 12million bid was put on ice			2
no 1 target : @entity1 have revives their interest in @entity4 goalkeeper @entity3 safe hands : @entity1 want @entity3 as competition for current goalkeeper @entity16 flying : @entity1 have also targeted a move for @entity26 defender @entity25 ( right ) no interest : contrary to reports , @entity1 are not considering a swoop for @entity8 's @entity30 @entity31 and @entity32 also showed interest in @entity3 but the player has made it clear he will only leave if he has a chance of playing regular first - team football			1
@entity1 are not unhappy with @entity38 but want better quality and improved competition in every position for next season			0
@entity38 is not being pushed enough by @entity43 and @entity1 will weigh up options ahead of the summer			0
@entity4 would want around £ 15m if they sold but have @entity46 keeper @entity45 to call on should @entity3 go			1
push : @entity1 want a serious challenge to @entity16 's position as no 1 @entity38 and @entity51 goalkeeper @entity50 have been linked with @entity52 in @entity54 media reports over recent days as @entity55 considers bringing in a younger keeper for either @entity57 or @entity58			1
meanwhile , @entity1 , who are signing @entity62 midfield prospect @entity60 , 16 , will hand trials to two footballers from @entity65			0
the 16 - year - olds @entity67 and @entity68 were spotted by local scouts as part of @entity1 's soccer schools in @entity72			1
@entity1 are also keen to bring in at least one new centre back this summer to replace @entity74			2
they would prefer experience , hence scouts looking at @entity25 at @entity26 and @entity13 of @entity76 but @entity77 does not intend to pursue interest in @entity8 's @entity30			1
@entity52 defender @entity79 was someone they considered earlier in the season but they are not alone			1
the 27 - year - old , has been linked with @entity31 also and is close friends with @entity4 winger @entity85			1
@entity79 's brother @entity86 confirmed to @entity87 at the weekend that @entity89 clubs had been in contact			2
' out of respect for the club , i will simply say it is an @entity89 club , ' said @entity86			0
' there are some very interesting offers , but @entity79 is at a club where he wants to be			0
the world 's best , in his eyes			0
and so we must say '' thank you very much for your interest , but no ''			0
' @entity8 are showing interest in @entity107 full back @entity105			1
the 19 - year - old is another product of @entity107 's academy and signed a four year contract last summer			2
while most eyes have been fixed on the progress of @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity112 has steadily developed into one of the @entity119 's outstanding prospects and has established himself in the @entity121 squad			2
he has been at @entity107 since the age of eight alongside the likes of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 and is holding down the right - back berth ahead of competition from @entity129			2
@entity8 are weighing up replacements for @entity131 as contract talks rumble on and @entity112 is ticking most of the boxes			0
@entity134 : @entity107 's 19 year - old right - back @entity105 ( right ) has impressed @entity8 this season adventurous : @entity112 has shown a natural instinct to get forward and join in on @entity107 attacks @entity139 defender @entity138 is attracting more @entity119 scouts by the week			1
@entity1 have been watching the 21 - year - old since last summer , @entity8 and @entity141 have also been at @entity139 games while @entity32 saw him in action for @entity145 against @entity146 last week			1
there are reservations about whether the 6ft 3in defender , who can also play left back , is quite ready for the @entity119 but , in watching him , eyes have also been drawn to his team - mates at @entity139			1
side - by - side : @entity138 ( left ) challenges @entity153 in a friendly for @entity145 against @entity146 no nonsense : @entity138 has been attracting interest from @entity1 , @entity8 , @entity32 and @entity141 they outclassed @entity158 in their recent @entity160 tie winning 6 - 1 on aggregate and the reputations of young midfielders @entity164 , 23 , and @entity165 , 21 , plus forwards @entity167 , 24 , and @entity168 , 21 , are fast developing			1
newcastle are particularly keen on @entity170 winger @entity168 with @entity171 watching in recent weeks and several clubs have watched @entity173 @entity167 on his way to 21 goals this season			0
however , he would struggle to gain a work permit			0
@entity179 scout @entity178 watched @entity181 striker @entity180 at the weekend			1
the 25 - year - old did n't disappoint as he scored a hat - trick in @entity181 's 5 - 1 win at @entity185			2
@entity179 are weighing up all options for the summer and , with relegation still a possibility , wanted to check whether @entity180 could step up a few levels			1
@entity179 missed out to @entity190 in the bidding for @entity192 from @entity193 18 months ago and @entity180 has been likened to the 27 - year - old @entity192 in terms of style and goalscoring record			2
reinforcements : @entity179 boss @entity198 has sent his scouts to look over @entity181 striker @entity180 @entity200 and @entity201 were also represented on saturday to see @entity180 take his season 's tally to 24 goals in 28 games			1
@entity180 wants to break the 30 - goal barrier before the end of the season and has been ruing a broken hand which ruled him out for 11 games earlier in the season			0
@entity179 are also showing interest in @entity190 's @entity213			2
the 25 - year - old @entity215 midfielder has been in and out of the starting line - up this season but is eager to play his part in their promotion push before taking stock of his future in the summer			0
@entity222 are continuing to watch @entity224 teenage striker @entity223			0
scouts were present as the 15 - year - old , who made his first team debut last season , played for @entity229 in their 5 - 0 @entity231 defeat against if @entity232			0
asked about @entity223 's performance , @entity234 coach @entity233 told @entity236 : ' he was completely cooked			0
it was a pity that he could not show a bit more , we heard that @entity222 were here and looked at him			0
' i hope they follow him for a long time , because today i think he was a bit taken aback by the gravity of the moment			0
' there has been much written and talked about him recently , and it 's not so easy to handle			0
' admiring glances : @entity251 are keen to bring @entity31 left - back @entity252 in the summer elsewhere , @entity251 remain keen on @entity31 defender @entity253 , 28 , and @entity255 goalkeeper @entity254 , 26 , is out of contract at the end of the season and has yet to be agree a new deal .			1

@entity1 are watching @entity4 goalkeeper @entity3
@entity26 's @entity25 and @entity76 's @entity13 are also under consideration for *defensive* reinforcements
@entity79 , of @entity52 , has turned down the option of moving to the @entity119 , reportedly to @entity31
@entity8 are interested in @entity107 right back @entity105
@entity139 defender @entity138 has been watched by scouts of @entity1 , @entity32 , @entity8 and @entity141
@entity179 are watching @entity181 striker @entity180
