’ with militias loyal to the @entity46 making frightening inroads in @entity25 , it is feared that jihadis could enter @entity19 by boat hidden among migrants			2
minister @entity0 , of the centre - right @entity52 party , said the solution has to be found in @entity4 : ‘ we must resolve the problem at its origin			1
there are two paths , stabilise @entity25 and create refugee camps in @entity4 so that the screening is done there , and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the @entity19 countries			1

’ @entity1 is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in @entity19			1

’ a pilot project in @entity88 is under discussion , she said			0
