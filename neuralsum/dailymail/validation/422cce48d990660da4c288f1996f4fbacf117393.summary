@entity0 , a popular custom online map tool used by companies including @entity3 and @entity4 , has created a new set of maps that are out of this world			1
the amazing maps of @entity9 were made using data from @entity11 and @entity13 spacecraft			1
they are in high - resolution , and allow users to zoom in to the surface and see key features across the red planet			1
scroll down to use both maps @entity21 - based @entity0 have created interactive maps of the surface of @entity9			1
they use data from @entity11 and @entity13 spacecraft to create the high - resolution detailed maps			1
the @entity28 map , shown , uses black and white imagery taken by the @entity30 on the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) the maps are named @entity33 and @entity34 , and were created by data analyst and mapping strategist @entity37 at @entity0			2
in december 2014 it was announced an instrument on the @entity40 had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface			0
the discovery , reported in the journal @entity48 , followed studies of gas samples by @entity40 's @entity51 ( @entity51 ) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis			0
‘ we love space , and we think it 's amazing how much detail is mapped of our distant neighbour , ’ said @entity55 on their website			0
‘ that 's why we 're using @entity0 's tools to make it possible to explore @entity9 from anywhere			2
’ the @entity28 map uses black and white imagery taken by the @entity30 on the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , provided by @entity11 and @entity67			0
@entity11 ’s @entity31 was operational in orbit around @entity9 from 12 september 1997 to 2 november 2006			2
it was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet , including its atmosphere and surface			0
data from the @entity31 mission has been used to identify landing sites for rovers and landers on the surface			2
the whole surface of @entity9 is then rendered in high - resolution , with landing sites and geological features on the surface highlighted			1
@entity11 ’s @entity31 , illustrated , was operational in orbit around @entity9 from 12 september 1997 to 2 november 2006			0
it was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet , including its atmosphere and surface one of the most interesting is @entity86 , an enormous dormant volcano that is one of the largest mountains in the solar system , measuring 16 miles ( 25 kilometres ) tall			1
a second map called @entity92 uses vectorised hillshades and contours from digital elevation models of @entity9 to visualise the surface			0
this uses information from the @entity99 an instrument that was also on board the @entity31			0
it also uses data from the @entity104 on @entity13 ’s @entity105 , which has been in orbit around @entity9 since christmas day in 2003 and is still operational today			2
one of the most interesting features that can be seen is @entity86 , a huge dormant volcano that is one of the largest mountains in the solar system , measuring 16 miles ( 25 kilometres ) tall a second map called @entity34 , shown , uses vectorised hillshades and contours from digital elevation models of @entity9 to visualise the surface			1
this uses information from the @entity99 an instrument that was also on board the @entity31			0

@entity21 - based @entity0 have created interactive maps of the surface of @entity9
they use data from @entity11 and @entity13 spacecraft to create the high - resolution detailed maps
on the surface can be seen features including the huge dormant volcano , @entity86
and the landing sites for the various spacecraft that have made it to the surface can also be explored
