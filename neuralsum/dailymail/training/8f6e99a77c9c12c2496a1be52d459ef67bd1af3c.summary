@entity1 actor @entity0 has joined growing calls for @entity3 to investigate a bizarre ' jelly doughnut ' shaped rock on the @entity7 surface			1
@entity0 asked @entity3 about the strange @entity7 rock found by @entity9 via @entity10 during a press conference on the opportunity rovers latest discoveries - asking mission controllers if they had ruled out ' @entity7 rock throwers '			1
mission controllers responding by saying @entity0 's theory was ' unlikely '			0
an strange rock , seen here on the left image , mysteriously appeared in front of @entity9 in the beginning of the month			2
an @entity24 writer claims it ' grew ' there and is demanding @entity3 investigate further @entity0 asked asking mission controllers if they had ruled out ' @entity7 rock throwers ' in the mystery over the jelly donut rock ' we 've got another question from @entity10 , this one from @entity0 , ' @entity3 spokesman @entity30 said , according to @entity33			1
' he 'd like to know if you 've ruled out the @entity7 rock throwers in the case of the jelly doughnut			1
' @entity7 rover lead scientist @entity37 of @entity38 responded , saying ' i think @entity7 rock throwers are unlikely , though we 'll keep our eyes open for those			2
' ' we did actually have another scenario which we 're still thinking about			0
' it 's the ' smoking hole in the ground hypothesis ' as i 've called it			0
' we can not yet rule out the possibility with certainty that there was n't a freshly formed impact crater nearby , and that this is a piece of stuff that was thrown out by a small impact			2
' a controversial science writer has already filed a lawsuit against @entity3 for their failure to investigate whether a rock seen on @entity7 is in fact an alien lifeform			1
last week the rock mysteriously appeared in front of the @entity9 , even though the same spot was empty a few days before			1
it is believed the rock , which is made up of manganese , suplhur and magnesium , suddenly appeared after it was dislodged by a meteorite or even the rover itself			2
opportunity landed on @entity7 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			2
instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years			0
the rover is currently at ' @entity73 ' at the rim of @entity75 on @entity7			0
the rover has n't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet			2
during its time on @entity7 , the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals			2
their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water			2
but author @entity93 , who writes on a wide variety of subjects - including books theorising that life on @entity98 has its roots in outer space - rejects such mundane explanations			1
the lawsuit , filed in a @entity102 court , is aimed at @entity3 and requests that it ' perform a public , scientific , and statutory duty which is to closely photograph and thoroughly scientifically examine and investigate a putative biological organism '			1
@entity108 reports that @entity93 has blasted the rock theory , since his examination found ' the same structure in miniature was clearly visible upon magnification and appears to have just germinated from spores '			1
in other words , it grew there			2
the suit adds : ' the refusal to take close up photos from various angles , the refusal to take microscopic images of the specimen , the refusal to release high resolution photos , is inexplicable , recklessly negligent , and bizarre			2
' he alleges that @entity3 have not investigated the spore - rock closely as they trying to gut planetary exploration programmes and serve corporate interests			1
he added : ' the only other exploration is that @entity3 's rover team is outrageously negligent , obscenely incompetent , shockingly ignorant about basic biology and prone to magical thinking			1
' lead @entity135 scientist @entity37 recently told a @entity3 event : ' we are as we speak situated with the rover 's instruments deployed making measurements of this rock			1
' we 've taken pictures of both the doughnut and jelly parts , and the got the first data on the composition of the jelly yesterday			1
' it 's like nothing we 've ever seen before , ' he said			0
' it 's very high in sulphur , it 's very high in magnesium , it 's got twice as much manganese as we 've ever seen in anything on @entity7			0
' i do n't know what any of this means			0
we 're completely confused , and everyone in the team is arguing and fighting ( over what it means )			0
' the discovery led @entity3 last week to issue a @entity7 status report entitled " encountering a surprise "			1
' ' opportunity encountered a slight surprise -- a rock had appeared in the images that had not been there before. , ' @entity3 said in a statement			1
a panoramic image of the @entity7 area named ' @entity174 , ' showing ' @entity175 ' and the surrounding plains of @entity177 on @entity7 taken by the @entity9 ' this target that has been named ' @entity179 ' and its origin has been the target of much speculation			0
' it will likely be the target of considerable investigation over the next few days ' ' we saw this rock just sitting here , ' said @entity37			0
' it looks white around the edge in the middle and there ’s a low spot in the centre that 's dark red - it looks like a jelly doughnut			1
' the rover , which landed on @entity7 in 2004 , has n't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet			0
but a photo taken on @entity201 ( january 8th , or the 3,540th @entity7 solar day since the opportunity rover landed ) shows a rock that was n't visible in previous photos taken on @entity206			1
astronomers at the @entity208 in @entity102 , who maintain the rover camera database for @entity3 , have named the ‘ donut - sized ’ rock @entity179			1
mr @entity37 said the rock may be @entity7 rock that was blown out of the ground by a meteoroid impact and landed next to the rover			0
another theory is that the rock previously got stuck in a rover wheel and finally fell into its current position , according to a report in @entity221			0
‘ [ the rock ] obligingly turned upside down , so we 're seeing a side that has n't seen the @entity7 atmosphere in billions of years and there it is for us to investigate , ’ mr @entity37 said			1
opportunity landed on @entity7 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			0
10 years later , and it is still active on the red planet ‘ it 's just a stroke of luck			0
’ opportunity has been on @entity7 for 10 years , despite being designed for a 90 @entity206 mission a @entity206 , one @entity7 day , is slightly longer than an @entity98 day at 24 hours and 37 minutes			0
its mission has been extended several times as it continues to make new and profound discoveries about the red planet			0
in december 2012 , for instance mission scientists announced that @entity9 was exploring a special spot on the rim of @entity75			0
the area , known as @entity245 , was found to contain clay minerals , implying that the area was exposed to water billions of years ago .			0

photo from january 8 shows a rock that was n't visible in previous images
rock *nicknamed* ' jelly doughnut ' - and found to have unique *properties*
but an @entity24 writer claims @entity3 have not investigated it *properly*
@entity93 claims the ' rock ' is alive and grew on the spot
he has filed a lawsuit demanding @entity3 investigate his claims
