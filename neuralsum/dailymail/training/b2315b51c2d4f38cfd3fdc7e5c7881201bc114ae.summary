police said revelations about @entity2 had encouraged other victims of sexual offences to come forward violent crime surged by 16 per cent last year and rape levels are at their highest ever level , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the number of violent attacks reported to police was 699,800 – almost 2,000 every day			1
there were also 24,043 rapes and 48,934 other sexual offences recorded by police in the year to september 2014 , the @entity11 said			1
in total , sexual offences rose 22 per cent			1
@entity19 officials put the rise down in part to the ‘ @entity2 effect ’ , with the revelations about the paedophile and other high - profile figures encouraging victims to come forward with crimes that previously went unreported			1
the @entity11 figures come at the same time as a separate set of statistics , from the @entity31 , revealed an 11 per cent fall in crime to seven million incidents			0
the result of the survey , which questions around 35,000 households , is the lowest estimate of crime since it began in 1981			0
homicides in @entity39 and @entity40 were at their lowest level since 1977 , at 482			0
it is thought the @entity11 findings on sexual offences may also have been influenced by better recording by the police – who have been under greater scrutiny following a row over claims they had been fiddling figures			1
the @entity11 figures are issued quarterly , with the previous release showing around 22,000 rapes in the year to june , which was then the highest level on record			2
there were 5,401 obscene publications and protected sexual material offences recorded by the police in the year to september , a 36 per cent rise			1
this is largely due to an increase in offences related to the making and distribution of indecent photographs , including those of children , via the internet or mobile phones			2
the @entity11 said police claim to be giving more attention to child sexual exploitation and this is likely to have led to more of these offences being identified			1
in the year to september the police recorded almost 500 rapes a week – or some 24,043 over the 12 months overall , police recorded crime showed no change from the previous year – at 3.7million offences			1
the @entity78 has introduced a new code of ethics which included changes to crime recording			0
it came after watchdogs raised fears that police were not logging offences properly			2
chief constable @entity87 , the national policing lead for crime recording , said the spike in crime ‘ is largely due to a renewed police focus on the quality of recording and a greater willingness from victims to come forward ’			1
it said there were seven million crimes in the 12 months to september – down from 7.9 million in the previous year			2
this is the lowest level of crime in 30 years			0
@entity100 this morning welcomes the fall in crime			0
he said : ' it 's encouraging to see that crime is at its lowest level since records began in 1981			0
the police are doing a great job			2
' until recently , police - recorded crime figures had been showing year - on - year reductions			1
the stagnation in the overall figure comes after concerns were raised about the poor quality of the way police record crimes , prompting the @entity116 to remove the figures ' official gold - standard status			2
the home secretary has overseen a fall in crime despite cutting the police budget by 20 per cent since 2010 the @entity31 , which measures people 's experience of crime , revealed an 11 per cent fall in crime crime prevention minister @entity126 said : ' police reform is working and crime is down by more than 20 per cent under this government , according to the independent @entity31			2
' there are now 2.4 million fewer crimes per year than when the coalition government took office , and crime has fallen 63 per cent since its peak in 1995			0
this is good news for a safer @entity39 and @entity40			0
' in 2013 , the home secretary commissioned @entity136 to carry out an inspection of police crime recording in all forces , and expects chief constables and police and crime commissioners to act on its recommendations			0
' we are already seeing the benefits of @entity136 's scrutiny in more accurate crime recording			0
in addition , more victims of sexual offences and violent offences are coming forward - this is something we welcome			1
' we have also transferred responsibility for crime statistics to the independent @entity11 , introduced a new crime outcomes framework to provide greater transparency and abolished ' one - size - fits - all ' performance targets			0
under this government , the police have one aim : to cut crime			0
