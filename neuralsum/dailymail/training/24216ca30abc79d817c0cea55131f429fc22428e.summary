you ’d think the last thing a fence that for years has had hundreds of bras hanging on it needs is support , but that ’s the case for the @entity6 in @entity7			1
for the past two years thieves have been stealing the bras off the fence , and in recent months there were regularly none to be seen on it at all			1
however , those who want to see the local tourist attraction remain are jumping out of their cups with anger			1
tired of being taken for boobs , the @entity17 page has been updating its followers with tip - offs on who the thieves are			1
no one has been arrested by police yet , but the page is now asking its supporters to return to the fence with their ‘ pre-loved ’ bras to help recreate the attraction			1
at one time hundreds of bras floated in the breeze at @entity6 one of the venture ’s most vocal supporters is @entity35 , who owns the @entity37 business			2
the bra fence sits directly opposite her place of work , but she has no problem with it at all			2
‘ generally the bras are taken at night , but on tuesday , during the day , some local people took the 30 or so bras that were put there recently , ’ she explained			1
‘ i saw them and have a good idea who they are			0
i ’m sure these people could be prosecuted by the police for theft , but we do n’t want to make too much of a stir out of it			0
‘ so instead we ’re going to put up hundreds all at once so it ’ll be very difficult for the thief or thieves to take them all down			0
it ’ll be a beautiful big spectacle			0
but as time went on thieves have taken more and more of them in recent years supporters of the tourist attraction always put more bras up when they got stolen but today the thieves have had their way and there are no bras to be seen at all some locals get caught in the act of stealing bras and the photograph of their raid is posted on @entity17 ‘ and that ’s why we started this campaign on @entity17 for people to send us their ‘ pre-loved ’ bras so we could get as many of them as possible			1
’ ms @entity35 also explained that many people hung bras on the fence because it meant something to them			1
members of the @entity17 page have even offered a reward for anyone who can identify the thieves ‘ visitors have come here and hung bras on the fence of their loved ones who may have passed away , ’ she said			1
‘ it means these thieves are stealing something that has got a lot of sentimental value for someone			0
but the thieves do n’t care about this at all			0
' in the good old days you would be able to see bras all the way up the road the site has been a controversial tourist attraction for years			1
it all began in 1999 when some passers - by began attaching bras to the fence – to this day no one knows why			1
but it soon became very popular and over the years the bras hanging on the fence grew to hundreds			2
people from all over the world visiting @entity7 would go to the @entity122 just to tie their bra to it			2
people have travelled from all over the world to tie their bras to the fence at @entity122 however , the busty tourist attraction split locals			1
some welcomed it as it brought tourists to the area and put the @entity122 on the map			0
others though , felt it was an eyesore and potential hazard to drivers using the road			0
many who hung bras on the fence did so because it held some sentimental value to them it was for this reason that in 2006 , after discovering the fence rested on public road reserve , the local council determined the bra fence was a ‘ traffic hazard ’ and ordered the bras to be removed from the fence			2
in 2010 however , a layby was put in so tourists and visitors could safely pull over and take photographs			0
but in the past two years , the bra snatchers have returned with a vengeance , and mrs @entity35 wants to teach them a lesson			2
today there 's nothing to be seen , but supporters say that is all going to change soon ‘ they ’re basically just spoilsports			0
i mean it ’s pretty childish to resort to doing this			0
but it ’s time we showed them that no matter what they do we wo n’t just sit back and let them away with it , ’ she said .			0

since 1999 visitors from all over the world have tied their bras to the *quirky* tourist attraction
in the past two years thieves have stolen the bras leaving nothing at all to be seen on the fence
members of the @entity17 page have started a campaign to bring back the bras
local people have *disagreed* for years over whether the site is good for the area or just an eyesore
