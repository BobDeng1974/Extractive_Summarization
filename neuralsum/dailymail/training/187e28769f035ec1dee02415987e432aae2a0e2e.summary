by @entity0 last updated at 9:35 am on 13th december 2011 @entity1 is a 22 - year - old honors college student studying psychology in @entity3 while @entity4 is seven years old and goes to school in @entity6			1
but this pair have one very special thing in common - at the time of their births they were both the tiniest babies to have survived			1
not only that but their lives were saved following their early births by the same doctor			2
@entity1 is 4ft8 " but suffers no long - term health complications despite weighing just 9.9oz at birth dr @entity19 of @entity20 , who resuscitated both children has now released a report based on his experiences to help answer the question - when do premature babies reach a point when they are likely to survive ? his report looked at @entity1 , born in 1989 weighing 9.9 ounces , which was then the world record ; and @entity29 , whose 9.2 - ounce weight at birth in 2004 remains the world 's tiniest			1
both of them could fit into the palm of an adult hand at birth and required intensive medical intervention			1
they were delivered by cesarean section more than a month early because their mothers had developed severe pre-eclampsia , dangerously high blood pressure linked with pregnancy			2
both babies were hooked up immediately to breathing machines with tubes as slender as a spaghetti strand slipped down their tiny airways			2
before the births , both mothers were given steroid drugs to speed up growth of the babies ' immature lungs			2
even so , @entity54 and @entity1 were on breathing machines for about two months , and hospitalised for about four months			1
@entity1 had mild brain bleeding , common in tiny babies but with no lasting effects apart from asthma			1
her father @entity60 said that at just 4ft8 " tall , his daughter 's main problem was finding clothes to fit her			2
@entity54 is also expected to develop normally			0
my how you 've grown : @entity4 weighed a record - breaking 9.2oz at birth , but was pictured happy and healthy a year later			1
she is expected to develop normally however dr @entity19 was keen to point out that these were extreme cases and should not be considered as a ' bench mark '			0
' these are such extreme cases , ' he said in the report published in @entity73			0
he added that although they were both the equivalent size of an 18 - week - old foetus , @entity54 was nearly at 26 weeks gestation , while @entity1 was at almost 27 weeks			1
this meant their lungs and other organs were mature enough to make survival possible			0
therefore the report highlights a sometimes overlooked fact : gestational age is even more critical for survival than size			0
dr @entity19 and his co-authors said most newborn specialists consider babies born after 25 weeks of pregnancy to be viable - likely to survive - and so they should receive medical intervention if necessary to breathe			0
younger babies are generally in a ' gray zone , ' where intervention is n't always so clear cut			0
in @entity97 , doctors have lowered that threshold - the gestational age - to 22 weeks			1
normal pregnancies last about 40 weeks			0
dr @entity101 , from the @entity102 estimates that about 7,500 @entity104 babies are born each year weighing less than 1 pound , and that about 10 per cent survive			0
' what is the real age of viability ? no one knows , ' said dr @entity109 , neonatology chief at @entity110 and @entity111 in @entity112			0
@entity1 's father is also stumped as to why his daughter survived			1
' i do n't know why , we were just extraordinarily lucky , ' mr @entity115 said .			0

@entity1 , 22 , weighed 9.9oz at birth , while @entity4 weighed 9.2oz
