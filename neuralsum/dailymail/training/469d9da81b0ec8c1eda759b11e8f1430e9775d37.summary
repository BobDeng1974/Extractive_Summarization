by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:06 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:23 est , 11 december 2013 with young children inevitably set to ask a barrage of questions about @entity6 this @entity7 , a team of scientists have created a fun guide that attempts to at least answer a selection of them			1
it was created by the founders of @entity17 @entity16 @entity15 and @entity18 who teamed up with economists from the @entity20 and @entity21 ( @entity22 )			0
they worked out that , based on official population figures , there are 1.6 billion children worldwide set to be visited by @entity6 this year			1
using official global population figures , the @entity17 @entity16 @entity15 and @entity18 and the @entity20 and @entity21 have attempted to calculate the science of @entity6 , pictured left			1
they worked out that 1.6 billion children will need presents globally this year based on population figures , @entity6 will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children			1
this requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies			1
with an average of 2.5 children per household , @entity6 will need to make 640 million stops on @entity42			2
each child needs 80cm of wrapping , which would stretch 1.5 million miles			1
the total number of presents would set @entity6 back £ 279.27 billion			1
prior to the big night , @entity6 needs to store all these presents in a warehouse			0
assuming each present average out at 0.008 m3 , the warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double - decker buses			0
but thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the @entity56 , @entity6 does have 32 hours to work with			0
the researchers estimated that @entity6 will therefore have to visit 5,556 homes every second on christmas eve to make sure every child gets a gift			1
with an average of 2.5 children per household , @entity6 will need to make 640 million stops on @entity42			2
if he eats milk and mince pies at each of these addresses , he will consume a total of 150 billion calories in just one night - 60,000 times his daily recommended intake			1
assuming each of the 640 homes he visits gives him a 200ml glass of semi-skimmed milk and one mince pie , @entity6 will have drunk almost 130 million litres of milk by the time he ’s finished his deliveries - enough to fill over 50 @entity78 swimming pools			2
he will also have eaten nearly 40,000 metric tonnes worth of mince pies			0
to work off this extra weight , @entity6 would need to walk 1.3 billion miles , which is 54,000 times around the circumference of the earth			2
according to the @entity85 , @entity6 's elves will use 80cm of wrapping paper for each child , which would stretch 1.5 million miles and the total number of presents would set @entity6 back £ 279.27 billion			1
he would also need to store these presents in a warehouse that covers the same space as 240,000 double - decker busses the @entity17 experts assume each elf can wrap a present in exactly 10 seconds and at that speed wrapping two presents for every child would require 3,000 elves to work eight hours every day for an entire year to get the job done			2
furthermore , if @entity6 gave two presents to each child the elves would need to use an average of 80cm of wrapping paper for each gift – which works out at a staggering 1.6 million miles of paper			1
if two metres of wrapping paper costs @entity6 99p , this will cost a total of £ 1.27 billion			2
based on these calculations , @entity7 gifts will cost @entity6 £ 279.27 billion this year - £ 30 billion more than the gdp of his home country of @entity115			1
that would be enough to go around the world 60 times and is more than six times the distance between the @entity56 and the @entity120			0
the researchers estimated that @entity6 will have to visit 5,556 homes every second this @entity42 to make sure every child gets a gift			1
if he eats milk and mince pies at each of these addresses , he will consume a total of 150 billion calories in just one night - 60,000 times his daily recommended intake prior to the big night , @entity6 would need to store all these presents in a warehouse , and assuming each present averages out at 0.008 m3 , the warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double - decker busses			1
although this release has been designed as a tongue - in - cheek promotion for the fair , @entity141 , the chief executive of @entity142 , said : ‘ with @entity7 on its way , we thought that calculating the ‘ science of @entity6 ’ would be a great way to get young people , parents and even @entity6 himself thinking about how important science , maths , engineering and technology are			0
@entity155 , a @entity22 economist , added : ‘ as our calculations confirm , the organisation and commitment which @entity6 and his elves display every year is incredible			0
‘ @entity7 must be really hard work for @entity6 and the whole team at the @entity161 ; i ’m sure they enjoy @entity163			0
’ in addition to the @entity17 's figures , @entity164 has calculated the disk space required to back up @entity6 ’s list			2
based on the world population data for under - 14s , taken from the @entity172 @entity171 , @entity164 worked out @entity6 would receive an estimated 1,843,868,987 letters this year			0
if each @entity7 letter takes up an estimated @entity175 when uploaded as a scanned copy , it would take up @entity177 of data each year			0
letters from @entity181 's children would take up the most room with @entity183			0
@entity184 comes in second taking up @entity185 and @entity186 sits in third place taking up @entity188			0
the @entity16 comes in at number 32 on the list , taking up @entity191 of data .			0

fun *infographic* attempts to *explain* the science behind @entity6 and his elves
based on population figures , @entity6 will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children
this requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories
each child needs 80cm of wrapping , which would stretch 1.5 million miles
the total number of presents would set @entity6 back £ 279.27 billion
