@entity1 ceo @entity0 took our a full page newspaper advertisement on sunday to apologize yet again for the company 's handling of the @entity7 outbreak in @entity8			1
in the advertisement printed in sunday 's editions of the @entity11 and @entity12 , mr @entity0 says the staff at @entity14 are ' devastated ' and ' deeply sorry ' that they were n't able to save @entity18 ebola ' patient zero ' @entity19			1
mr @entity19 was initially misdiagnosed by the hospital and sent away with a prescription for antibiotics , despite telling staff he had recently arrived in the country from @entity7 - stricken @entity25			1
he passed away on october 8 , 11 days after returning to the hospital a second time			1
' based on what we already know , i can tell you that many of the theories and allegations being presented in the media do not align with facts stated in medical record and the accounts of caregivers who were present on the scene , ' he said			0
it was previously reported that nurses at the hospital were wearing the wrong protective gear for the first few days of mr @entity19 's treatment , leaving their necks and wrists exposed			1
mr @entity36 does admit , however , that @entity7 protocols were not ' fully deployed ' by the time mr @entity19 was admitted a second time and that ' we made some mistakes in handling this very difficult challenge			1
' ill : @entity14 nurses @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) contracted the disease in the days after mr @entity19 's death			1
the hospital is still investigating what led the two nurses to catch @entity7			2
ms @entity41 is now being treated at the @entity73 in @entity74 , while ms @entity42 is being treated at @entity75 in @entity76 ' in short , despite our best intentions and skilled medical teams , we did not live up to the high standards that are the heart of our hospital 's history , mission and commitment , ' mr @entity36 wrote			1
since mr @entity19 's passing , mr @entity36 says the hospital has been instituting new guidelines should another @entity7 case present itself			1
he says staff are not being trained on how to put on and take off protective clothing and that a ' buddy system ' is helping them follow @entity7 procedures			0
they have also made changes to their medical records system which will better help diagnose the disease			2
' our prayers are with mr @entity19 's family , ms @entity41 and ms @entity42 , their families and the @entity7 victims around the globe , ' mr @entity36 says			1
mr @entity36 's apology follows the release of @entity14 medical records which show the hospital 's protective protocols were ' insufficient ' in dealing with an @entity7 outbreak			1
the @entity110 has pointed to lapses by the hospital in those initial days			0
and @entity19 's medical records show heightened protective measures as his illness advanced			1
but either because of a lag in implementing those steps or because they were still insufficient , scores of hospital staffers were put at risk , according to the records			2
the hospital 's protective protocol was ' insufficient , ' said dr. @entity124 of the @entity125 , who was part of the @entity110 team that investigated the first recorded @entity7 outbreak in 1976			1
' the gear was inadequate			0
the procedures in the room were inadequate			0
' ' insufficient ' : this file photo , shows a copy of @entity19 's medical records from @entity14 , provided by @entity19 's family			1
experts say the records show that protective protocols were not sufficient to deal with the @entity7 outbreak @entity19 's medical records , provided by his family to @entity144 , show @entity41 , the first @entity145 nurse to be diagnosed with @entity7 , first encountered the patient after he was moved to intensive care at 4:40pm on september 29 , more than 30 hours after he came to the @entity148 nearly 27 hours later , @entity140 , a second nurse who contracted the disease , first appears in @entity19 's charts			1
because doctors and nurses are focused on logging the patient 's care , they may not always note their own safeguards in the medical records			1
in @entity158 's first entry , she makes no mention of protective gear			0
when she logs again the following morning , she specifically mentions wearing a double gown , face shield and protective footwear , equipment she mentions again in later entries			0
in the first apparent mention of @entity167 — identified by just her first name in another nurse 's notes — she is said to have worn personal protection , including a hazardous - materials suit and face shield			2
it 's unclear whether those initial interactions with @entity19 represent the time at which a breakdown in protection led to the infections , or whether such lapses persisted during the remainder of the patient 's 11 - day stay			1
at least 70 workers are named in the records as being involved with @entity19 's care in that period			2
@entity145 health hospital workers gathered on thursday to say goodbye to ms @entity41 , as she left the hospital for further treatment at @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity74 dr. @entity193 , the @entity110 director , told lawmakers during a congressional hearing thursday that he did not know how the nurses got infected , only that ' possible causes ' had been identified			0
in comments a day earlier , he gave a clue : ' for the first several days of the patient 's stay , before he was diagnosed , we see a lot of variability in the use of personal protective equipment			0
' because @entity7 has an incubation period of up to 21 days , those who cared for @entity19 at the start of his second hospital stay will not be considered safe from infection until monday			1
those with him at the time of his death will not emerge from monitoring until october 30			0
@entity19 first arrived at @entity215 on september 25 but was sent home			2
when he returned by ambulance at 10:07am on september 28 , he was sicker and probably more contagious			0
@entity218 noted immediately upon his intake that he had recently arrived from @entity25			0
five minutes later , a nurse notes that he is in a room and had ' put on airborne precautions			0
' nine minutes after that , @entity19 is seen by a doctor who writes that @entity7 is a possibility and notes that he ' followed strict @entity110 protocol ' by being ' masked , fully gowned and gloved ' when treating @entity19			1
the doctor makes no mention of eye protection such as goggles or a face shield , which are considered basic equipment in @entity7 guidelines issued by the @entity110			2
there is also no initial mention of foot coverings , which are suggested when such patients have diarrhea or vomiting , as @entity19 did , according to the records			0
it is also not clear when @entity19 was safely isolated , though the records refer to him being in an ' isolation room ' in the @entity148 on september 29			0
numerous entries in the records of @entity19 's stay at the hospital — both in the er and later in intensive care — make note of precautionary measures			1
many other entries are silent on the issue , and the mention of hazardous - material suits does not appear in @entity19 's records until after his diagnosis is confirmed on september 30			2
hospital officials say @entity19 was immediately put in isolation in a private room and that staff adhered to @entity110 guidelines on protective gear , even though those guidelines changed during the course of @entity19 's stay			2
' from our review of the medical records , interviews with clinical staff and clinical observation , our use of personal protective equipment was compliant with @entity110 guidelines , ' hospital spokesman @entity265 said saturday			2
dr. @entity275 , a member of @entity145 governor @entity277 's newly appointed infectious - disease task force , said the issue was not protocols , but preparation			0
' i think the problem is there was n't enough time to do training , ' she said			0
the hospital has denied the allegations of several of its nurses who anonymously aired concerns through a statement issued by the @entity292 union			0
among their complaints : that @entity19 was kept for hours in an area of the emergency department where seven other patients could have been exposed ; that a nurse supervisor faced resistance from higher - ups when she said he should be moved to an isolation unit ; and that even after the patient was isolated , hospital workers came and went from his bedside without proper protection , then walked through halls that were not properly cleaned			1
' if any of those allegations — let alone more than one — are correct , if they are valid , then obviously his whole hospitalization put health care workers at risk , ' said dr. @entity312 , an infectious - disease specialist at @entity314			0
a half - dozen doctors and nurses make notes in @entity19 's chart during the first 24 hours of his stay in the @entity148 as his first night at the hospital fades into the following morning , his condition worsens			1
a doctor notes he is suffering and deteriorating			0
at one point , he asks for a diaper because he 's too exhausted to get up			0
the records do not reveal what happened once hospital staffers left @entity19 's bedside			2
walking through the hallways , interacting with other staff and patients , removing protective gear and any other physical motions — even as seemingly minor as rubbing an eye or scratching an itch — before being properly sanitized could have led to further infections .			0
