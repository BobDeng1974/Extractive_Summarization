@entity0 has dropped the strongest hint yet that it is planning to introduce subscriptions for video content			1
the plan was revealed in fragments of code in the latest update of the @entity0 app - and comes after claims the @entity11 - owned site could introduce the new paid - for model as early as this spring			1
the move is being viewed as an aggressive move by the world 's most popular streaming video site to compete directly with traditional television services for viewers and advertisers			1
get your credit cards ready ... fragments of code in the latest @entity0 's mobile app update offer the strongest hint yet that the online streaming video service is set to introduce subscriptions for paid - for content the code , unearthed by @entity31 operating system fan blog @entity29 , seems to describe a function in the app which tells users they can only subscribe to or unsubscribe from paid channels from their desktop or laptop computers			1
it reads : ' you can only subscribe to this paid channel on your computer			2
' and : ' you can only unsubscribe from this paid channel on your computer			2
' the discoveries have not yet been confirmed , but the messages apparently hidden within the code appear to back up reports last month that claimed @entity0 would soon begin asking users to pay to access some content			1
the company has held talks with several video producers , asking them to submit applications to create for - pay specialist channels , according to @entity58			2
the first such channels could be available at @entity60 and @entity0 is expected to charge between 60p ( $ 1 ) and £ 3 ( $ 5 ) a month			1
in addition to episodic content , @entity0 is also considering charging for content libraries and access to live events , a la pay - per - view , as well as self - help or financial advice shows			1
benefit to content creators : @entity0 ceo @entity70 has talked about the website 's potential to provide second - or third - tier cable networks with a more direct channel to their passionate viewers @entity0 , has been moving to add professional - grade video programmes to the vast archive of amateur - produced , home - shot videos that have made the site so popular			1
twitter executives have vowed the introduction of a new advertising model will not lead to users seeing more adverts on the website - yet			0
@entity88 users already sometimes see paid - for tweets among the posts from people , organisations and companies they have chosen to follow			1
but the microblogging site 's new @entity94 ( application programming interface ) will let advertisers better tailor their campaigns to relevant members of @entity88 's 200million active users			0
@entity101 launched similar technology in 2010 , helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $ 3billion the following year			0
as speculation grows that @entity88 will follow @entity101 with a stock market float , it seems the company 's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential			0
@entity88 product manager @entity111 told the @entity112 there would be ' no direct impact on the user experience ' , merely that the service 's users should see ' more relevant and better ads '			0
she did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown , but insisted the company took users ' experience ' really seriously '			0
currently all content is available to consumers for free and is supported by advertising that appears alongside the videos			0
@entity0 has hinted in the past that it was considering offering subscription - based paid content			1
at a media conference last year , ceo @entity70 talked about the potential to poach second - or third - tier networks having trouble building big enough audiences on cable to command subscription fees from distributors			2
internet distribution , the thinking goes , would give some of these networks a more direct line to their passionate base with lower costs			0
' if we have a subscription model , then absolutely that 's something that becomes possible , ' said mr @entity70			0
' we have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models , ' a @entity11 spokesman said , in a statement			2
' the important thing is that , regardless of the model , our creators succeed on the platform			0
' there are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions , so we 're looking at that			0
' @entity0 is treating paid subscriptions as an experiment , much like video rentals when it began in 2010			1
the initial group of channels will be small , estimated at about 25 at the outset .			0

find backs up speculation that @entity0 plans paid - for channels by spring
move would bring it into *competition* with *satellite* and cable services
@entity11 - owned firm has solicited bids from several production companies
channels expected to cost between $ 1 ( 60p ) and $ 5 ( £ 3 ) per month
