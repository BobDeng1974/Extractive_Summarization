@entity0 fears @entity1 could come back to haunt @entity2 on saturday			1
the @entity4 and @entity5 star was deemed surplus to requirements by @entity8 in the summer and sold to their @entity10 rivals			1
@entity2 could leapfrog the @entity11 in the table with victory at @entity14 , but former @entity15 fears the worst			1
@entity1 has enjoyed a storming start to the season for his new club and country @entity1 has scored 10 goals in 21 games so far this campaign for @entity4 and @entity5 ' in terms of @entity2 , they miss the energy that @entity1 once gave them in attack , ' @entity0 said in the @entity28			1
' my view has not changed : he should not have been sold and recently i have felt that @entity2 have looked a bit pedestrian going forward			2
as a @entity2 fan i am a little concerned for them going into saturday ’s game			2
' aside from @entity35 at his very best , @entity2 lack a central midfielder capable of linking play and getting the best out of their forwards			0
@entity1 will come up against former @entity14 team - mate @entity41 at the weekend ' they need that individual who can pass the ball forward , play one - twos and bring the strikers into the game			1
that kind of playmaker – a @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity50 – is vital to any side			0
they are the brains of the team and without them the forwards can struggle			0
' much will be made of @entity1 ’s first game against the club at which he grew up			0
the immediate assumption will be that @entity1 is nurturing some grievance against @entity2 at being sold and will want to prove a point			1
' i do n’t see it that way			0
@entity1 will want to play well because he would want to anyway , regardless of the opposition , and from what i see and hear he is very happy at @entity4 and with his move to @entity69			2
' @entity70 will always score goals - @entity71			0
