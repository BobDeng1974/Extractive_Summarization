by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor former @entity3 official @entity2 refused for a second time on wednesday to testify about her role in a scheme to target conservative organizations that applied for tax - exempt status during president @entity10 's first term in office			1
@entity2 risks arrest if she is found in contempt of @entity14			1
the @entity15 ruled on june 21 , 2013 that @entity2 , formerly in charge of the @entity3 's @entity18 office , waived her right to invoke the @entity20 during a may 22 hearing when she insisted in a lengthy opening statement that she had done nothing wrong			2
wednesday 's continuation of that hearing was a brief affair , with @entity28 chairman @entity27 rep. @entity27 adjourning it after @entity2 cited the fifth amendment again and refused to answer questions			1
i can see no point in going further			0
' i have no expectation that mrs. @entity2 will cooperate with this committee , and therefore we stand adjourned			0
' after angry objections from ranking @entity44 rep. @entity57 , @entity27 cut off his microphone , told @entity2 , ' you 're released , ' and said , ' we 're adjourned			1
' @entity57 continued to complain loudly without the aid of a microphone			0
the @entity63 published video of the exchange , titled ' @entity57 goes ballistic			0
' the fifth amendment to the @entity67 guarantees that @entity2 ca n't be compelled to testify against herself			2
but with the committee ruling that @entity2 's statements in may disqualified her from leaning on that right , she becomes subject to arrest if she continues to refuse to answer questions – either as leverage to force her to comply , or simply as punishment for thumbing her nose at @entity14			1
house speaker @entity75 , an @entity76 @entity46 , seemed to support a contempt cititation as a last resort , telling reporters wednesday that he would ' wait for a report from chairman @entity27 about what happened or what will happen			1
but at some point i believe that she has to testify , or she should be held in contempt			2
' tea party activists have insisted that during the 2010 election year , the @entity3 placed some of their nonprofit groups on hold for more than three years while liberal organizations were quickly given tax - exempt status four separate @entity94 rulings have confirmed the right of @entity14 to incarcerate @entity1 for contempt , although it has n't been done in more than 75 years			1
a july 2007 @entity97 spells out the process : ' the individual is brought before the @entity15 or @entity100 by the sergeant at arms , tried at the bar of the body , and can be imprisoned in the @entity106 jail			1
' in june 2012 the full @entity15 voted to hold attorney general @entity107 in contempt after he refused to hand over documents relating to the botched @entity111 gun - running sting			1
@entity107 was n't arrested , largely because he heads the federal law enforcement agency that would be responsible for taking him into custody			0
@entity2 's lawyer @entity114 has played a cat - and mouse game with committee @entity46 for the past week , at first saying she faced death threats and would n't appear , then offering to produce her at a sworn deposition , and at one point saying she would only answer questions if she were immune from prosecution			1
@entity124 , national coordinator of @entity125 the vote , a conservative group that claims it was targeted by the @entity3 , the @entity128 and other agencies , said wednesday that ' when an alphabet soup of government agencies descended on and investigated me and my family , i did n't have the option of doing what @entity2 did today			2
i had to submit to invasive and aggressive investigations despite the fact that i had done absolutely nothing wrong			0
' the sideline spat between @entity27 and @entity57 quickly became the talk of @entity141 on wednesday			2
@entity2 refused to testify for the second time , opening her up to the possibility of a contempt charge from @entity14 @entity57 , a @entity147 @entity146 , tried to prolong the hearing with what he said was a ' procedural question ' – but then proceeded to make a statement			1
@entity27 , the @entity46 firebrand from @entity152 , cut off his microphone			2
' mr. chairman , you can not run a committee like this , ' @entity57 shouted as @entity27 stood to walk out of the hearing room			0
' if you will sit down and allow me to ask a question – i am a member of a @entity14 ! i am tired of this ! ' ' you can not just have a one - sided investigation , ' @entity57 continued while @entity46 staffers left			1
' there is absolutely something wrong with that , and it is absolutely un-american			0
' @entity27 returned to tell @entity57 , ' we had a hearing			0
i gave you an opportunity to ask your questions			0
' ' i do have questions , ' the @entity146 said , raising his voice again as @entity27 left to address a waiting phalanx of reporters			0
' chairman , what are you hiding ? '			0

the one - time head of the @entity1 tax authority 's branch *overseeing* nonprofits wo n't testify about a years - long scheme to target conservative groups
@entity14 has the power to hold her in contempt , try her and imprison her in the @entity106 jail
that power has n't been used in more than 75 years but used to be common in *bribery* and other cases
after the @entity46 chair of the @entity38 quickly adjourned wednesday 's hearing , his @entity44 *counterpart* went ' ballistic '
