the jam - packed venue was expecting a lot from this a-list - adored duo , who just continue to impress season after season - and their latest offering did n't disappoint			2

roll on next summer : @entity4 continue to impress season after season - and their latest offering at @entity1 today did n't disappoint overall impressions : the dungaree - style jumpsuit ( left ) and flatforms continue to reference the @entity34 , while fisherman - style pants ( right ) pay tribute to backpacker days in @entity38 light - as - air dresses and skirts in the sheerest of contrasting layers are made for sexy summer nights , while one black knee - length dress with a split at one side will be easy day - to - night favorite for the @entity49 set			2
the @entity51 pant , too , with its tie waist is a luxe take on fisherman trouser - a dose of nostalgia for those who may have adopted the louche ' backpacker chic ' look while traveling the beaches of @entity38 as a student			0
accessorize all areas : almost every look was completed by one of the design duo 's new handbags anyone for cricket ? the plunging v - neck sweater promises to be a favorite in store next spring there was a sporty feel in the form of buttoned - up polo shirts and cricket jumpers with the deepest of v - necks , and the @entity34 influence that has been so strong over the past summer looks set to continue into next : it certainly lent a fun , youthful edge with crop tops , sharply - tailored overalls and flatform sandals			1
though it was a spring / summer collection , there was still plenty of outerwear in the form of blush leather duster coats and a coral blazer with a to - die - for cut - out back - it makes sense : these boys are from @entity95 where summer does n't necessarily mean warm weather			0
but of course it will be the release of @entity4 's latest accessories that will set the cash registers on fire - round white sunglasses and easy - to - walk - in booties and sandals are instant cool for the wearer - even if they are n't a catwalk model			0

slouchy satchels and compact totes will fit fashion editors ' paraphernalia nicely - and the average woman 's too			1
a star - studded front row comes as little surprise at @entity4 , and before the show , the attention was largely on @entity141 editor - in - chief @entity140			1
front row faces : @entity143 ( left ) and @entity144 ( right ) were among the guests at @entity4 today family affair : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) take their bows after the show			1
