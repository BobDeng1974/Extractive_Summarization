@entity0 - accused of planning a ' @entity2 - style ' terror attack has denied a hammer , knife and flag he was carrying was a terrorist ' tool kit ' that would be used to kill a soldier or politician a teenager accused of plotting a ' @entity2 - style ' murder has denied a 12in knife and a hammer in his rucksack were a terror ' tool kit '			1
@entity0 , 19 , was arrested in an east @entity18 street last august carrying the blade and hammer along with a black flag and had earlier researched the location of @entity23 bases in the south east of the capital , a jury has heard			1
his @entity27 trial was told that he turned to @entity28 early in 2014 and was arrested after he showed his ex-girlfriend his weapons , described one of @entity2 's killers as a ' legend ' and told her he would ' kill soldiers '			1
after his arrest last year , @entity0 told a security officer that he had been on his way to kill a @entity41 soldier at an army barracks when he was stopped , jurors have heard			1
but at his trial today , @entity44 , defending , asked @entity0 whether the flag , hammer and knife he was carrying could be correctly described as a ' tool kit ' and he planned to use the flag once he had beheaded a soldier or member of the government			1
the defendant replied : ' that 's not what i was going to do			0
' @entity0 told the jury he was ' kicked out ' of his home after his @entity60 parents found out that he had converted to @entity28			1
initially he turned to the @entity61 for help , before he fell in with members of an extreme group called @entity65 - or @entity66 - who gave him money , clothes and a place to stay			1
they invited him to a meeting in the basement of a @entity75 halal sweet shop and then he went on demonstrations organised by the group			1
talking about the discussion he had heard about sharia law , he said : ' when i heard it , i thought it was extreme what they would do to someone when they steal or commit a sin			0
i did not share those views at all , what sharia law does			1
for example , a theft under sharia you have your hands cut off			0
' but the court heard that afterwards , he posted on @entity97 : ' sharia law on its way on our streets			0
we will implement it , it 's part of our religion			0
' asked why he did that , he said : ' i did not believe it			0
i wanted to fit in with these people because they were giving me places to stay and they did not like moderate @entity28			2
' the jury have been shown the 12in knife found in @entity0 's back pack when he was stopped by police he insists the knife and a hammer found on him were not going to be used in a terror attack on a soldier at the time he was arrested in june last year on an unrelated matter , police found a ripped up letter in his jeans pocket in which he wrote about mounting an attack on a @entity41 soldier and expressed the desire to die a martyr			1
but he told jurors : ' i was ranting and raging about the situation in @entity130 countries which was described in these talks			0
i did not believe it at all			0
i was ranting out of anger			0
' @entity0 told the jury that he did not disagree with what happened to @entity136 but he had told police that he would not do it himself			1
he went on to say that he carried the black flag with him because he could get texts to go to an @entity66 demonstration at short notice			2
the court heard after he bought the flag at one of the protests , he posted on @entity97 : ' i have got my black flag			2
i 'm going to rock it everywhere i go in the @entity149 ' face			0
' but the defendant , who had been a @entity130 for just three - and - a - half months at the time of his first arrest , said he believed public preaching was the way to achieve sharia law in the @entity41			2
he denied styling himself as @entity156 after one of @entity136 's killers , saying the @entity130 first name meaning ' fighter , a warrior ' suited his character because he used to do boxing and wrestling			0
@entity0 's lawyer put it to him that he would use the flag after he had committed the attack			1
he denied this @entity0 said he was only ' ranting and raving ' about extremism to fit in with a group who were offering help mr @entity44 asked : ' at any time were you planning a terrorist attack on military personnel or a member of the government ? ' @entity0 replied : ' no. ' mr @entity44 had earlier told the jury : ' it 's not illegal to be offensive			1
in fact only recently we saw heads of state in @entity184 marching to defend the right to be offensive in the wake of that atrocity that happened there			2
' our prime minister went there and said it 's quite right people have this right			0
we have this right in this country			0
that 's the beauty of rights - they apply to all of us			2
' we have the right to be offensive			0
we all have the right to have an interest in gore and grisly stuff			0
we have the right to have undoubtedly repulsive views , some of which he has expressed			1
' he is not on trial for his views			2
he is on trial because the @entity211 bring a charge to say that he was going to behead a @entity41 soldier despite the fact there is not one shred of evidence to show he carried out a reconnaissance mission and , you bet , if there was , they would know			2
' the lawyer added : ' he is not on trial for the murder of @entity2			1
he is not on trial for his opinions , as repulsive as you may find them			0
' @entity0 , of @entity61 , south @entity18 , denies a charge of preparing an act of terrorism on or before august 20 last year			1
the trial continues and was adjourned until tomorrow			0
