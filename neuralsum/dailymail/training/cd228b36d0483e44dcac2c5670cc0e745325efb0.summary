having seen @entity2 sign three of the most outstanding players from the last @entity4 , some @entity1 fans could be forgiven for feeling their big rivals have stolen a march on them this summer			1
but the club have spent around £ 127million on transfers and sporting director @entity9 has brought in six new faces doubling - up in positions where a club legend - @entity12 and @entity13 – needed replacing			0
the headlines have largely been written by @entity2 but if @entity1 can get @entity16 and @entity17 on the pitch and keep them there ; ensure that signing two ‘ first - choice ’ keepers does n’t mean war on the training ground ; and squeeze the best out of @entity25 ( who has stayed ) and @entity27 ( who has come back ) then this could still be their strongest group since 2011			1
both are good with their feet as well as their hands , have experience in top leagues and , at 31 and 22 , have years ahead of them – @entity50 more than @entity47			1
the only doubt concerns the wisdom of buying two keepers of similar standing who will both want to play all the time			0
@entity2 played @entity63 in the cups and @entity65 in the league last season but the former suffered from a lack of continuity and played poorly in the @entity71 final			0
defensively they have at least finally signed an out - an - out centre - back in @entity73			2
there are concerns about the ongoing injury problems that meant he joined the club and headed straight for the treatment room but if he gets fit and stays fit there is little doubt his intelligence , distribution and aerial ability will make him an asset			0
the slightly less physical demands of @entity88 will suit a player for whom the 90 - minute intensity of the @entity91 was beginning to take its toll			2
@entity93 will also reinforce @entity1 ’s famously under - resourced defence			1
he has pace to burn and having started his career as a left - back he could play on the left of a back three should @entity100 go 3 - 4 - 3 this season			1
the @entity101 signed from @entity102 will be 31 this october and @entity16 will be 29 in november			1
but experience is what @entity1 need defensively as they wait to see how younger players such as @entity106 and @entity107 develop			2
safe hands : @entity47 makes an acrobatic save during a friendly defeat to @entity112 side @entity111 experienced : @entity93 ( left ) will take no time to adapt to @entity88 after joining from @entity102 the big plus with @entity93 is that he does not need to adapt to a new league			1
and neither does @entity36 who joined from @entity38 aged 26 and has been impressive in pre-season			0
taking set - pieces and releasing forwards with the passes that , as an occasional starter , @entity25 will also still be able to provide			0
@entity36 was the outstanding midfielder in @entity88 last season and it looks good business			1
which just leaves the biggest piece of business @entity1 have done this summer – bringing in @entity17 for £ 75m			2
his current ban has supporters ’ excitement on hold			0
but if the @entity130 allows him to return to ‘ football - related ’ activity he will be presented at the @entity132 and can begin to get acquainted with the other two thirds of what @entity1 hope will be an explosive front three to leave even @entity2 ’s @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 trio in the shade			2
will it work ? @entity17 showed with his second goal against @entity143 in @entity144 at the @entity4 what he can do running the right channel and @entity147 is happy on the left			0
and both will get their chance to play more centrally when @entity151 drops deep so there is no reason why it wo n’t			0
when @entity151 does n't play @entity17 will play through the middle and @entity156 will be given a chance to impress out wide			0
@entity17 also brings an intensity that @entity1 have missed in the last three seasons and like @entity161 and @entity36 his career lacks silverware giving @entity1 back the desire they lost with a squad bloated by having won so much in such a short space of time			1
they have spent more than their rivals			0
and with @entity17 banned , @entity16 injured and @entity93 admitting to liking the occasional cigarette when he joined , and evidently neither @entity172 nor @entity173 , it would be easy to say they have not got their money ’s worth			1
but when the squad is written down in black and white , it ’s hard to see where the gaps are			0
@entity50 / @entity47 @entity183 / @entity182 / @entity181 / @entity180 @entity36 / @entity184 / @entity186 / @entity185 @entity147 / @entity27			1

@entity1 have already signed six new players since the arrival of @entity100
@entity17 , @entity36 and @entity16 among arrivals
@entity194 *giants* have also signed two new *goalkeepers* - @entity47 and @entity50
defender @entity93 bought from @entity88 rivals @entity102
@entity100 's squad looks string ahead of the new season , with two *talented* players in every position
