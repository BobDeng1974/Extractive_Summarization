the @entity1 's top court ruled today that @entity2 and @entity3 did not commit genocide against each other 's people during the bloody 1990s wars sparked by the break - up of the former @entity9			1
the @entity10 said @entity2 forces committed widespread crimes in @entity3 early in the war , but they did not amount to genocide			1
the 17 - judge panel also ruled that a 1995 @entity17 offensive to win back territory from @entity19 also featured serious crimes , but did not reach the level of genocide			1
presiding judge @entity23 of @entity24 ( fourth from right ) opens the @entity10 session in @entity26 , @entity27 before ruling that @entity2 did not commit genocide in @entity3 during the bloody wars sparked by the break - up of the former @entity9 in the 1990s @entity3 's justice minister @entity30 ( left ) shakes hands with his @entity2 counterpart @entity32 prior to a session of the @entity10 in the @entity26			1
the 17 - judge panel also ruled that a 1995 @entity17 offensive to win back territory from @entity19 also featured serious crimes , but did not reach the level of genocide today 's decision was not unexpected as the @entity1 's @entity9 war crimes tribunal , a separate court also based in @entity26 , has never charged any @entity19 or @entity3 with genocide in one another 's territory			1
@entity10 chief judge @entity23 said both sides had committed crimes during the conflict , including forcible displacement , but that neither had proved genocide , which ' presupposes the intent to destroy a group , at least in part '			2
but he added : ' the court encourages the parties to continue their co-operation with a view to offering appropriate reparation to the victims of such violations , thus consolidating peace and stability in the region			0
' the case had been described by @entity2 foreign minister @entity61 as perhaps one of the ' most important events ' determining his country 's relations with @entity3			0
anticipation : a photographer waits for the judges to enter the @entity10 in @entity26 , @entity27 @entity69 had dragged @entity70 before the @entity10 in 1999 on genocide charges linked to the war in @entity3 during the bloody break - up of the former @entity9			1
@entity2 was accused of ethnic cleansing as a ' form of genocide ' in the town of @entity78 and other areas , leading to large numbers of @entity3 being displaced , killed or tortured and their property destroyed			2
about 20,000 people died in the conflict , one of several bloody wars that shook the @entity86 in the 1990s			0
@entity78 was captured after a three - month - long attack by the @entity9 army ( @entity89 ) and @entity2 rebels			0
after its fall , about 22,000 non-serbs were expelled , and about 350 people from the @entity78 region are still reported missing			0
@entity70 responded with a counter-suit in 2010 , saying about 200,000 ethnic @entity19 were forced to flee when @entity3 launched a military operation to retake its territory in 1995			0
following @entity69 's counter-offensive , called @entity101 , the proportion of ethnic @entity19 in @entity3 shrank from 12 percent to four per cent			0
@entity70 was outraged in 2012 when @entity101 's @entity3 military commander , @entity102 ( above ) , was acquitted on appeal before the @entity26 - based @entity104 for the former @entity9 @entity2 ultra-nationalist leader @entity105 walks with his para-military group near the @entity3 town of @entity78 in 1991 where @entity2 was accused of ethnic cleansing as a ' form of genocide ' @entity70 was outraged in 2012 when @entity101 's @entity3 military commander , @entity102 , was acquitted on appeal before the @entity26 - based @entity111 ( @entity111 )			1
' the irony is that @entity3 ... which with its forceful separatism , triggered an avalanche of the horrid civil war in the former @entity9 , is accusing someone else of genocide , ' @entity2 said in a statement as the case was being heard last year			1
the cases were part of the long legal fall - out from the break - up of @entity9 into seven states in wars that lasted eight years and left more than 130,000 dead in @entity127 's worst conflagration since @entity128			2
the @entity1 tribunal for the former @entity9 , which also sits in @entity26 , has long since ruled that genocide was committed in @entity131 , where more than 8,000 @entity133 men and boys were killed when the @entity1 ' safe haven ' of @entity136 fell to @entity138 forces in 1995			2
in an earlier ruling from 2007 in a case brought by @entity131 , the @entity10 found that @entity2 was not responsible for genocide , but that it had breached the genocide convention by failing to prevent the massacre in @entity136 .			0

@entity10 said @entity2 committed widespread crimes
but the 17 - judge panel has ruled that they did not amount to genocide
@entity10 also *rejected* @entity2 claim that @entity3 committed genocide in 1995
*allegations* stem from wars sparked by break - up of @entity9 in 1990s
