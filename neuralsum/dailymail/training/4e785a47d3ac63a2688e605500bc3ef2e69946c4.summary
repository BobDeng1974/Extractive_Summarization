he died from carbon monoxide poisoning the moment @entity6 stepped into her ten - year - old son @entity7 's bedroom one cold morning , she knew immediately that something was terribly wrong			1
' @entity7 was usually up before me , keen to get to school , but that morning there was n't a sound , ' says @entity6 , 36 , from @entity14 , @entity15			1
the previous evening @entity7 , a keen footballer with a cheeky smile , had been watching tv and playing on his @entity18 when @entity6 popped her head round the door to say goodnight			2
he had seemed his normal self - but that morning he was lying with his face to the wall and did n't stir when she called him			2
' i thought he was joking at first but i went to touch him and he felt frozen , ' she recalls			2
with her heart hammering , @entity6 called an ambulance and her mum			0
' a million things were going through my head - i did n't know if he was dead or alive			0
the ambulance operator asked me to check for a pulse and a heartbeat , and i thought i heard one but it must have been my own heart pounding away			0
' within minutes paramedics arrived			0
@entity6 , who was 27 at the time , then received the awful news that @entity7 - her only child - was dead			0
' when an ambulanceman came downstairs and started to say , " i 'm sorry ... " i just said , " i know "			0
we were so close - i was just devastated			0
' he was my whole family , and at that point i could n't envisage how i would carry on			0
you put your child to bed thinking it 's the safest place in the world but that night it was n't			2
' overcome with grief , she could n't understand why @entity7 had died			2
the paramedics mentioned that gas could be involved and told her she could n't return to her home			0
then later that afternoon the coroner 's office called to say blood tests had shown carbon monoxide in @entity7 's bloodstream			1
carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas produced when fossil fuels , including gas , oil and solid fuels , do n't burn properly because appliances are faulty or poorly ventilated			1
so instead of combining with oxygen to make water vapour and carbon dioxide , the gas creates soot and carbon monoxide			1
cases peak in winter when the heating is on and doors and windows are closed			0
it does n't have to come from your own house to be lethal			2
for , as the inquest into @entity7 's death heard , carbon monoxide had leaked from a faulty boiler in a neighbouring house			1
' when i found out i was furious - i 'd looked after my home and my son , ' says @entity6			0
' the neighbour had only been in the house six weeks			2
i could n't talk to her much because she did n't speak good @entity90 , but she must have been devastated to find the fumes had killed @entity7 while her children were fine , despite the danger			2
she 'd put her trust in the landlord to maintain the property			0
' each year , at least 4,000 people are treated in hospital for the effects of breathing in carbon monoxide and around 40 @entity101 die , according to the @entity102			1
however , there is growing evidence that official figures for carbon monoxide deaths are too low : in @entity107 , which has a similar size population , around 100 carbon monoxide deaths are recorded each year , making it the largest cause of death by accidental poisoning			1
@entity7 's mother @entity6 , from @entity14 ' forty deaths may be on the low side , ' says dr @entity117 , a @entity119 gp who is backing the @entity121 - be alarmed ! campaign			1
' it 's possible some people 's deaths are wrongly attributed to conditions such as a heart complaint			2
the problem is we do n't routinely test for carbon monoxide during post-mortems in this country			1
' when carbon monoxide is breathed in , it displaces oxygen from the bloodstream			1
as a result , healthy tissue starts to die and the brain and heart ca n't function properly			0
if just 0.5 per cent of the air we inhale is carbon monoxide , it can be fatal within a minute or two , according to the @entity145			1
' people can be exposed to different levels of carbon monoxide and respond differently , but some develop long - term problems without anyone ever determining that it was carbon monoxide that caused them , ' says dr @entity117			1
at lower doses it can cause long - term health complaints such as headaches or heart failure ( because the lack of oxygen makes the heart work harder ) - these often go unlinked to carbon monoxide			1
' prolonged exposure over time can cause coronary heart disease , angina and heart attack , ' says dr @entity117			0
' it can also cause brain damage , causing confusion , memory and co-ordination problems ; or it can cause problems in pregnancy , including low birth weight and stillbirth			0
' if a patient complains of nausea and headaches which disappear when they leave the house , that should be a red flag - these symptoms can occur after exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide over a long period , though if you are exposed to low levels enough times it can eventually kill you			1
' sometimes the symptoms may be confused with a viral infection - even by doctors			0
the carbon monoxide that killed @entity7 was thought to have built up to a fatal level in just one evening			1
after he died , in 2004 , @entity6 threw herself into campaigning to warn other families			2
she now runs the @entity199 , which campaigns to improve gas safety and raise awareness of carbon monoxide			1
because you ca n't see , smell or taste carbon monoxide , the only way to tell it 's there is a carbon monoxide detector			1
these are small sealed boxes , like a smoke alarm , that cost about Â£ 15			0
experts recommend having one in every room with a heating appliance that can emit carbon monoxide , though some people also put them in bedrooms			1
a recent survey found that 35 million @entity101 do n't have a carbon monoxide alarm at all			1
' many people die in their sleep , which is why people should buy audible alarms that will wake them up , ' says dr @entity117			2
from october 1 last year , new legislation in @entity227 made it compulsory to fit a carbon monoxide alarm when any new fossil - fuelled heating appliance is installed			1
alarms are also a legal requirement in new homes in @entity233			0
although new appliances are less likely to be faulty , they can cause problems if wrongly installed			0
but dr @entity117 , and others , want more stringent @entity101 - wide legislation			0
as well as having a carbon monoxide alarm , checking heating and cooking appliances before winter is vital , say experts			1
deaths and hospital admissions peak in winter when appliances are working harder			0
after @entity7 died , in 2004 , @entity6 threw herself into campaigning to warn other families ' appliances can emit carbon monoxide if birds have nested in a chimney and blocked it , or ivy has grown over an external flue , ' says @entity253 , a director of the @entity254 and @entity255 , the trade association representing gas detection companies			1
' even covering all four rings of your gas hob with jam - making pans can cause a problem			0
' elderly people who block vents to prevent draughts , or stay close to a poorly ventilated gas fire , can be at risk - and people with heart or respiratory problems may be vulnerable to lower levels of carbon monoxide			1
@entity6 was so devastated by @entity7 's death that she has never returned to the house where he died			1
' i did n't even want the furniture , ' she says			0
' it changed my life totally			0
if i 'd had any other children i 'd be paranoid - how could i put a baby or child to bed knowing what happened to @entity7 ? ' now people come up to me in the street to say they heard me speak and bought a detector , which went off - so warning them saved their lives			0
' i just do n't want any other family to have their life torn apart the way mine was			0
