researchers have revealed the ' superlanguage ' they believe @entity3 people living in @entity4 15,000 used to communicate			1
the @entity6 study shows many of the words , such as i , you , we , man and bark are still in use today - and found there was even a word for mother			1
the researchers even show that complete sentences could still be understood today			1
where @entity4 's language came from : the ' common words ' point to the existence of a linguistic super-family tree that unites seven major language families of @entity26 , shown here the first common language ? researchers found these common words could be used across @entity4 15,000 years ago researchers believe the findings show a linguistic ' common language ' allowing different groups to communicate			1
using statistical models , professor of evolutionary biology @entity34 and his team predicted that certain words would have changed so slowly over long periods of time as to retain traces of their ancestry for up to ten thousand or more years			1
' we discovered we could predict a rate of evolution for words , ' professor @entity34 told @entity48			1
' there was a small subset of words that evolved so slowly over time they might last up to 20,000 years			1
' you realise , golly , i might be able to predict words that link these families , and we found these 23 words that have a common ancestor			1
' the 23 words , which include @entity59 , @entity60 , to spit and worm , would have sounded very different , says professor @entity34			2
' the words would not sound exactly the same , but they would be recognisable , or in a form that we could easily learn to recognisable			2
' the words for mother , for instance , sound like mama or something similar			2
' if we were to sit round a campfire , we could have a basic conversation			2
' previously linguists have relied solely on studying shared sounds among words to identify those that are likely to be derived from common ancestral words , such as the @entity78 pater and the @entity80 father			2
a difficulty with this approach , the team said , is that two words might have similar sounds just by accident , such as the words team and cream			2
to combat this problem , professor @entity34 's team showed that a subset of words was used frequently in everyday speech , are more likely to be retained over long periods of time			0
the team used this method to predict words likely to have shared sounds , giving greater confidence that when such sound similarities are discovered they do not merely reflect the workings of chance			0
' the way in which we use a certain set of words in everyday speech is something common to all human languages , ' said professor of evolutionary biology @entity34 from the @entity6			0
' we discovered numerals , pronouns and special adverbs are replaced far more slowly , with linguistic half - lives of once every 10,000 or even more years			0
' as a rule of thumb , words used more than about once per thousand in everyday speech were seven to ten times more likely to show deep ancestry in the @entity26 super-family			0
' the research shows they each probably stem from a common language ancestor			0
' as words evolve they change , such as p to f transition , which change over time			0
' professor @entity34 called for more research into common languages			0
' the fact we can find these ancient links should encourage us to do more of it			0
' we can test interesting questions about human migration and evolution through these links			0
' a common language : the @entity139 , which led to humanity being forced to speak different languages , according to the @entity142			0
researchers now say they have reconstructed an early common @entity141 language in addition to @entity141 , the language families shown in the map above include : professor @entity34 's previous research on the evolution of human languages has built up a picture of how our 7,000 living human languages have evolved - with the ' proto - @entity155 ' language that was the common ancestor to about 700 contemporary languages that are the native tongues of more than half the world ’s people			1
professor @entity34 and his research team have documented the shared patterns in the way we use language and researched why some words succeed and others have become obsolete over time			1
this is done by using statistical estimates of rates of lexical replacement for a range of vocabulary items in the @entity141			0
' the search for ever deeper relationships among the @entity177 ’s languages is bedeviled by the fact that most words evolve too rapidly to preserve evidence of their ancestry beyond 5,000 to 9,000 years , ' the researchers wrote			1
' on the other hand , quantitative modeling indicates that some ' ultraconserved ' words exist that might be used to find evidence for deep linguistic relationships beyond that time barrier			0
' our results suggest a remarkable fidelity in the transmission of some words and give theoretical justification to the search for features of language that might be preserved across wide spans of time and geography			1

researchers uncovered language @entity3 people used to communicate - with many of the words still in use today
believe ' superlanguage ' may have existed so different groups could communicate
*experts* say we could ' hold a simple conversation ' using the language .
