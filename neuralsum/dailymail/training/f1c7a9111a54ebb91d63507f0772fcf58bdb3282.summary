@entity1 ’s hopes of winning the @entity2 were fading last night after his leadership came under heavy fire from his own party			1
the embattled @entity7 leader faced a new crisis as the party ’s biggest private donor joined the withering attacks on his @entity13 policies			1
and mr @entity1 was described as looking ‘ haunted ’ because he knew that his party was on course to lose the election , according to the editor of @entity19 ’s leading @entity7 - supporting magazine			1
his credibility was further eroded as it was revealed that : the new pressure on @entity1 over his controversial vow to reverse @entity13 reforms came from millionaire businessman @entity32 , the brother - in - law of former minister @entity33			1
mr @entity32 backed the attack on the policy made by former labour cabinet minister @entity36 last week , exposing rifts within the party			1
the tycoon said @entity7 was wrong to decry the increasing involvement of the private sector in the @entity13 , adding : ‘ i agree with @entity36 – if you look at the @entity45 model , they have a much greater mix of public and private provision			1
’ mr @entity32 , the chairman of consumer goods giant @entity49 , gave @entity7 £ 1.65million in 2013			2
he also condemned mr @entity1 ’s plan to use a mansion tax to provide much of the extra £ 2.5billion a year he plans to inject into the @entity13			1
‘ i am not convinced of the case for a tax on expensive properties , ’ he told @entity52			0
‘ and it certainly should not be hypothecated for the @entity13			0
it would be much better to introduce extra council tax bands and spend the money on local needs , such as affordable housing			0
’ @entity1 faced another devastating critique from @entity63 , editor of the left - leaning @entity66 magazine , who said @entity7 knew it was heading for defeat in may – but had no idea how to stop the rot			1
writing in today ’s @entity52 , mr @entity63 says @entity1 is at war with his campaign chief @entity72 , shadow chancellor @entity73 has ‘ all but given up ’ on the party leader , and shadow health secretary @entity74 is busy promoting his own leadership ambitions			1
the mood of @entity25 is ‘ not so much one of despair , it ’s worse than that – resignation , ’ says mr @entity63			0
@entity7 appeared to be ‘ willing itself to defeat			0
the party knows it is losing an election that it should be winning , and does n’t know what to do about it			0
’ mr @entity63 says ‘ haunted ’ @entity1 has ‘ grown distrustful of colleagues ’ adding : ‘ there are splits over strategy between @entity1 and @entity72 , and between @entity1 and @entity91			2
balls has “ all but given up on @entity1 , ” i was told by a friend of the @entity73			0
’ mr @entity63 says @entity1 is ‘ decent and intelligent ’ and could yet scrape home with more seats than the @entity96 – though not achieve an overall majority – but only thanks to @entity19 ’s voting system which favours @entity7			1
a measure of the anxiety in @entity1 ’s inner circle is the claim that they have already discussed how to prop up his leadership in the event of defeat on polling day , in a series of so - called ‘ war gaming ’ sessions			1
‘ a group of @entity1 ’s advisers have talked through what to do if they wake up on may 8 and @entity115 is still @entity116 , ’ said an insider			1
‘ they know @entity1 ’s @entity119 enemies are waiting to strike and their plan is to buy time by arguing that @entity115 will be in a very weak position if he fails to win an outright majority			1
@entity1 ’s people will say that @entity115 may be unable to form a new @entity13 and there could be a second election very soon			1
‘ if that happens , they will say that @entity7 needs stability , not a divisive leadership contest lasting months , and that @entity1 would provide that stability			2
’ @entity1 ’s hopes of winning the @entity2 were fading last night after his leadership came under heavy fire from his own party further signs of @entity1 ’s embattled position emerged from reports of an election ‘ pep talk ’ he delivered to @entity119			1
according to one witness , he said : ‘ i know they will be coming for me and i am ready for it			0
even the liberal @entity140 appears to be losing the faith			0
first , on tuesday ’s @entity143 , @entity142 skewered shadow health secretary @entity74 over his @entity13 policy			0
then on yesterday ’s today programme on @entity146 , @entity147 , who once used the term ‘ we ’ on air to describe @entity7 , repeatedly likened mr @entity1 ’s efforts to the party ’s doomed 1992 campaign during a challenging interview with @entity155			1
’ some thought he was referring to growing attacks on him by former ministers such as @entity36 , who served in @entity159 ’s government and backed @entity160 in the 2010 @entity7 leadership contest			2
a source close to @entity1 said : ‘ he is very angry at the number of @entity7 politicians who are prepared to criticise him publicly			0
’ one senior @entity7 mp pointed the finger of blame at @entity170 , who enraged @entity1 by criticising the mansion tax			2
‘ the sniping against @entity1 [ @entity1 ] has all the hallmarks of a @entity170 campaign , ’ said the mp			2
‘ @entity1 despises him for what he said on the mansion tax			0
@entity170 can not get over the fact that @entity1 has turned his back on his precious @entity7 project			2
’ friends of @entity170 said it was ‘ nonsense ’ to suggest he was behind a campaign to undermine @entity1			2
one mp , a long - standing ally of @entity1 , said : ‘ you sometimes wonder whether these @entity185 actually want us to win the election			2
maybe they would rather @entity1 loses so they can say “ we told you so ” and replace him with another @entity185			0
’ @entity1 became a laughing stock when his clumsy attempts to eat a bacon butty slavered in ketchup were captured on camera			0
and it appears that his shadow chancellor is n’t quite prepared to forget the embarrassing incident			0
yesterday @entity73 tweeted the ‘ bliss ’ of finding a ‘ cafe which does proper bacon sandwiches ’ after two hours of canvassing @entity199			0
his post triggered a tsunami of sarcastic comments , including , ‘ can you eat it without looking like an alien ? ? ? ? ’ and ‘ you are n’t giving the other @entity1 lessons in eating a bacon sandwich are you ? ’ in the end , mr @entity73 joined in , pointedly revealing he had ordered ‘ bacon on a big bap , no sauce … ’			0
