by @entity0 @entity1 pictured with his then - wife @entity2			1
the couple separated in 2012 @entity1 has broken his silence over the prescription drug dependency that plunged his life into chaos , forcing him to check into a rehabilitation centre for a five - week program			1
the former @entity11 champion , who became dependent on the sleeping pill @entity13 , says the 2012 breakdown of his marriage to @entity2 had taken a ' physical , mental and emotional ' toll on the 33 - year - old			1
@entity1 had taken @entity13 at the @entity17 in @entity18 on friday 21 february when he was photographed in his underwear and with a singlet pulled down around his waist in the hotel 's reception			1
witnesses at the time described the swimmer as appearing disorientated , and said the he was asking if anyone had seen his four - year - old son , @entity28			1
@entity1 also had @entity28 's twin sister @entity29 with him			1
describing the events that led to the incident , @entity1 says he had visited a doctor who 'd prescribed him sleeping pills because he felt like , ‘ the wheels were falling off ’			1
‘ i had seen a doctor because i needed a rest , i was exhausted , ’ he told @entity35			0
‘ there was so much on my plate and the wheels were falling off			0
‘ i was n't getting any sleep			0
i ’d sleep for 45 minutes and wake up and need to do something for a couple of hours and then go back to sleep and i was anxious and sleep - deprived ... so he gave me the @entity13			1
' the first time i ’d taken it in quite some time was that friday night			0
the now - infamous picture of @entity1 in his underwear in the foyer of @entity18 's @entity17 ' i sleep in my singlet and briefs so that ’s what i was wearing			1
then i jumped into the lift , it was empty , and as i was going down i thought : " jeez , i ’m not going to walk out into the foyer " , so i took off my singlet and wrapped it around me , put @entity29 down , and there was a security guard right near the lift			0
i yelled out to him and he came over and i told him what was going on and it was literally minutes and they found ( @entity28 ) , on a different floor			2
that medication was still affecting me at that point because i did n't take it until late in the evening			0
' it later emerged the 33 - year - old had developed a reliance on the powerful sleeping pill during the latter stages of his swimming career			1
he said the public scrutiny following the breakdown of his marriage had seen him ' white - knuckling ' for more than a year , before he finally admitted he needed help			1
this week he completed an intensive five - week stint in an @entity86 treatment facility			1
he 'll now move in with his parents for a unspecified period of ' supervision ' as @entity1 adjusts to normal life again			2
the three - time olympic gold medal winner is considered one of @entity94 's finest athletes ' i ’d been talking to my mum and dad and i ’d said things to dad for probably 12 months prior to that saying i do n’t feel like i ’m coping that well anymore with so many different elements of my life and being on my own , ' he told @entity35			2
' it was really difficult and i was white knuckle all the time , and i ’d always push myself through it and physically , mentally , emotionally it really started to take its toll on me			2
' @entity1 blamed the toughness instilled in him as an @entity11 athlete for the delay in seeking help			2
he said he had been trained to never reveal a weakness , and it was a mentality that stayed with him long after his @entity11 career ended			0
‘ i 've been an athlete since i was four years old and every moment from there on ’ til i was 28 was about pushing through , overcoming , push the pain away , get on with it , ' he said			0
‘ but when it came to something emotional , you just learnt to suppress it			2
to actually stop and assess for a second , you did n't do it			0
you just get on with it and just execute what you have to do and you kind of get to a point where you probably ca n’t keep going like that			0
‘ i was of that psychology in every part of my life			0
that was my approach and it ’s probably good as an athlete , but not so good in every other part of your life			0
