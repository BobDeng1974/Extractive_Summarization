by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 06:12 est , 25 june 2013 an undercover policeman revealed last night that he took part in an operation to smear the family of @entity5			2
@entity6 said his superiors wanted him to find ‘ dirt ’ that could be used against members of the murdered teenager ’s family			1
the spy said he was also tasked with discrediting @entity5 ’s friend who witnessed the stabbing and campaigners angry at the failure to bring his killers to justice			0
@entity6 said senior officers were afraid that anger at the failure to investigate the teenager ’s racist killing would spiral into disorder on the streets			1
they had ‘ visions of @entity41 ’ , whose beating at the hands of police led to the 1992 @entity45 riots , he said			2
@entity46 has this morning urged @entity25 to launch a probe into what happened			1
' the prime minister is deeply concerned by reports that the police wanted to smear @entity5 's family and would like the metropolitan police to investigate immediately , ' a @entity50 spokesperson said			1
the revelations mark the most extraordinary chapter so far in the sorry history of @entity25 ’s jaw - dropping undercover operations			1
@entity5 was the victim of a racist murder in 1993			2
it was one of the highest profile racial killings in @entity62 history the whistleblower is one of several to come forward to reveal deeply suspect practices by those ordered to infiltrate political protest groups from the 1980s onwards			2
yesterday @entity5 ’s mother @entity67 said being targeted by an undercover officer was the most surprising thing she had learned about the marathon inquiry			2
she said : ‘ out of all the things i ’ve found out over the years , this certainly has topped it			0
‘ nothing can justify the whole thing about trying to discredit the family and people around us			1
’ the news will further inflame critics of covert policing of activist groups and raises questions over whether a police review will flush out all malpractice			1
’ the 20 - year - old operation was revealed in a joint investigation by @entity90 and @entity91 ’s dispatches being broadcast tonight			0
@entity6 posed as an anti-racist activist during four years he spent living undercover among protest groups following @entity5 ’s murder in april 1993			1
the former officer said he came under ‘ huge and constant pressure ’ to ‘ hunt for disinformation ’ that might be used to undermine those arguing for a better investigation into the murder			0
he now wants a full public inquiry into the undercover policing of protest groups , which he labelled ‘ morally reprehensible ’ in the past			2
he said : ‘ i had to get any information on what was happening in the @entity5 campaign			0
‘ they wanted the campaign to stop			0
it was felt it was going to turn into an elephant			0
throughout my deployment there was almost constant pressure on me personally to find out anything i could that would discredit these campaigns			2
’ mr @entity6 joins a number of whistle blowers who infiltrated protest groups for the @entity22 @entity6 was also involved in an ultimately failed effort to discredit @entity122 , a close friend of @entity5 who was with him on the night he was murdered			1
the former spy trawled through hours of @entity124 from a demonstration to find evidence that led to mr @entity122 being arrested and charged with violent disorder in october 1993			0
however , the case was thrown out by a judge as an abuse of the legal process			0
family : @entity5 's mother @entity67 and ex-husband @entity134 , @entity5 's father the spy monitored a number of ‘ black justice ’ campaigns , involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody			1
but he said his handlers were most interested in any information he could gather about the several groups campaigning over the death of @entity5			1
although @entity6 did not meet the @entity5 family , he passed back ‘ hearsay ’ about them to his superiors			1
mrs @entity151 said she was always baffled why family liaison officers were recording the identities of everyone entering and leaving their household following her son ’s murder			1
she said the family had always suspected police had been gathering evidence about her visitors to discredit them but had no ‘ concrete evidence ’			1
in 1997 , @entity6 argued that the @entity22 should ‘ come clean ’ over the existence of its undercover operation to sir @entity29 and his inquiry			1
but commanders opted for secrecy and claimed it was for the public good as there would be ‘ battling on the streets ’ if the public ever found out			0
@entity6 was a member of a covert unit known as the @entity175			1
set up to combat protests against the @entity177 in 1968 , the @entity175 was funded by the @entity178 to operate under the radar for four decades			0
using the undercover alias @entity180 , he worked between 1993 and 1997 infiltrating a group named @entity183			0
he said he was one of four undercover officers who were also required to feed back intelligence about the campaigns for justice over the death of @entity5			1
the now disbanded unit has already been struck by controversy after its spies fathered children with their targets			0
an external investigation of past undercover deployments is being undertaken by a team of officers led by @entity199 chief constable @entity198			2
@entity200 monitored a number of ' black justice ' campaigns , involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody mr @entity122 always suspected he was a victim of a dirty tricks campaign by police			1
in an interview six years after the murder he said he felt the police ‘ investigated us more thoroughly than they investigated the boys ’ – referring to those behind the killing			0
@entity217 , the former home secretary who in 1997 ordered the inquiry that led to the @entity5 , said he was stunned			0
he said : ‘ i should have been told of anything that was current , post the election of @entity222 ’s government in early may 1997			0
but much more importantly , [ the ] @entity29 inquiry should have been told			0
’ @entity224 , @entity22 commissioner between 1993 and 2000 , said he was not aware any information had been withheld from sir @entity29			0
a @entity22 spokesman said : ‘ the claims in relation to @entity5 ’s family will bring particular upset to them and we share their concerns			1
’ these revelations and others about undercover police officers are contained in the book undercover by @entity239 and @entity240			2
