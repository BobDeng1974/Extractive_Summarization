@entity0 was accused of ' offensive ' behaviour ' touching on racism ' by a @entity4 community leader yesterday after banning journalists from a place of worship			1
the @entity9 leader visited the @entity10 – a @entity4 temple – during a campaign tour of the @entity12 on wednesday			1
but his team banned national media journalists from the event – despite the fact that @entity10 are traditionally open to all			1
worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the @entity9 leader , who had donned a red head - covering to comply with @entity4 customs			1
but even one of the @entity4 journalists was allegedly asked to leave @entity9 's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions			1
@entity39 , an adviser to the @entity40 who attended the visit , said the attitude of the @entity8 's team went against the ethos of his faith			1
he said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a @entity29 are always open to all			2
and he suspected the @entity9 leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head - covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was ' offensive , even touching on racism '			1
he told the @entity57 : ' the whole thing was very carefully stage managed			0
they said there will be no cameras whatsoever , they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a @entity29			1
some of the party officials were downright rude			0
' my children , who are three and six , were ushered out of the way			0
the whole thing did not feel right			0
' it was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended			0
you do n't do that in a @entity10 – usher people around			0
' the incident will increase concern about the ' controlling ' nature of @entity9 's election campaign , in which the @entity83 and members of the public are kept at arm 's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the @entity90			2
public visit : @entity92 at the @entity93 in @entity94 mr @entity39 said he suspected mr @entity0 was trying to ingratiate himself with the @entity4 community but was ' worried about the reaction of non-sikhs ' if he was seen in the headgear at the @entity99 and @entity29			1
' there 's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the @entity4 community , ' he added			1
' they wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a @entity29 – but that he did n't want the publicity to go any wider			0
' mr @entity39 , whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten - point @entity110 , said it was disappointing that mr @entity0 had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about @entity9 's stance on @entity4 issues			1
he added : ' @entity9 told the media it was a private visit , but that 's nonsense			1
was he going there for prayers ? of course not – it was part of the campaign			0
' @entity9 dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers			2
but it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent mr @entity0 creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run - up to the @entity130			2
he has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past , including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year			2
labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader			2
@entity142 broadcast footage on wednesday evening showing the doors of the @entity10 being closed after mr @entity0 entered			2
only an official @entity9 photographer was allowed inside , and pictures were not released to the national media			1
the only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper			0
it showed that once inside , mr @entity0 took off his shoes and donned a red head - covering known as a ramal			2
he was also presented with a traditional orange scarf , or siropa , which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries			0
broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused			0
but mr @entity0 held a brief press briefing for three journalists from the @entity4 media on @entity9 's battlebus			1
they were told they could each ask one question , which was agreed in advance			0
but a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question			0
he was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the @entity93 in @entity94			0
a journalist from the @entity4 media asked mr @entity0 if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the @entity93 in @entity94 ( file picture used ) @entity182 , secretary of the @entity99 and @entity29 , which co-operated with @entity9 over the visit , insisted worshippers were not offended by the event			1
he added : ' it went smoothly and we felt it was a success			0
' we were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but i would n't say anyone was upset or offended by it			0
' the row risks provoking cynicism about mr @entity0 's motives			1
electoral experts believe @entity200 's 500,000 @entity4 could play a key role at next month 's election			2
a @entity9 spokesman said : ' it is ridiculous and untrue to say that @entity0 did not want to be pictured at the @entity29			2
' the visit was widely covered by the national and @entity4 press and many worshippers took pictures inside with @entity0			1
' to respect worshippers in the prayer hall , @entity0 gave press interviews , including with the @entity40 , outside the temple			1
' but mr @entity39 said the visit contrasted with a visit by @entity92 in february to the @entity29 , adding : ' people who were there said it was very different			0
he was more relaxed and people could come and go , which is strange because you 'd think the prime minister would have much tighter security			0
' mr @entity92 also visited the @entity93 in @entity94 in 2013 .			0
