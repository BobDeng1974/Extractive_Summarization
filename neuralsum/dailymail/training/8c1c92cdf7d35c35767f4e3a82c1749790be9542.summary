by @entity1 reporter published : 13:42 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 14:54 est , 2 july 2012 in a shocking turn of events @entity2 has conceded her spot in the 100 meters rather than race against training partner @entity7			1
the two tied for third at the @entity9 in @entity10 nine days ago			2
the top three finishers earn a spot on the team			1
@entity2 notified @entity14 on monday of her intention to withdraw			1
too close to call : @entity2 ( bottom ) and @entity7 both cross the finish line for the @entity19 trials with a time of 11.068			1
the race is decided by when their torsos cross the line , and the picture showed a tie her agent , @entity27 , already made it known that @entity2 would not participate in a runoff monday night to break a third - place tie at the @entity32 track trials			1
in an email sent through her agent to @entity14 , @entity2 said : ' i understand that with this decision i am no longer running the 100m dash in the @entity19 and will be an alternate for the event			1
' @entity14 president @entity40 said the organization is ' disappointed ' @entity2 had a change of heart			1
@entity43 will now race in both the 100 and 200 in @entity44			1
@entity2 did n't qualify in the 200 , but is eligible to run in the @entity19 400 - meter relay			1
' the situation has been difficult for everyone involved , ' @entity43 said in a statement			0
' i had accepted the @entity14 decision and was prepared to run at 5 p.m. i wanted to earn my spot on this team and not have it conceded to me so i share in everyone 's disappointment that this runoff will not happen			1
all i can do now is turn my focus to @entity44			1
' @entity43 sailed to victory in the 200m on saturday night			2
@entity2 , just left of @entity43 , did not finish in the top three in that @entity2 only reluctantly agreed to the runoff			1
she believed she won on the track fair and square nine days ago			1
' in my heart of hearts , i just feel like i earned the third spot , ' she said sunday			2
' i almost feel like i was kind of robbed			2
' @entity2 leaned across the finish line and looked up to see her name on the scoreboard in the third spot behind winner @entity71 and runner - up @entity72			1
the 22 - year - old @entity2 even took a celebratory lap around the track , waving an @entity32 flag			1
she received a medal and held a news conference			0
then , she found out about the dead heat from reporters			0
the thrilling @entity19 athletic heat which ended in a tie had the world talking as it was unprecedented			1
the two female sprinters involved in the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss of a coin , but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead			0
battle : the track timer had initially named @entity2 , right , as the winner before officials reviewed the results ' i was pushed into a corner			1
they said if you do n't make a decision , you give your spot up			2
i work too hard to just give my spot up			2
i had to say it was a runoff			0
' the controversy in the 100 overshadowed the entire trials simply because @entity14 had no protocol in place to deal with a dead heat			2
@entity14 officials quickly scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure			0
the athletes had a choice between a runoff or a coin flip			0
they chose to settle matters on the track , not with the flip of a quarter			0
' they both feel they deserve a spot on the team and they 're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a competitive fashion , ' @entity14 president @entity40 said on sunday			2
' i think it 's good for the sport and it 's good for them to show their level of competitiveness and passion and drive for what they 've been working so hard to accomplish			0
' the bottom line is that this is , in my opinion , the best way to be able to resolve this issue			0
' disbelief : the two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women 's 100m @entity19 team the resolution was delayed for eight days because their coach , @entity145 , wanted to wait to make a decision until after 200m on saturday			1
@entity43 won turned in a personal - best time of 21.69 seconds , the fourth - fastest by an @entity32			2
' i did n't get to really enjoy it , ' @entity43 said			0
' as soon as i came off , that 's the first time that i actually thought about the process			0
of course , i was n't thinking i wanted to do a coin toss , but that 's the first time i sat down and went through things in my head			0
' once this is over , i 'll be happy about it			0
' after two races and six rounds , both will be running with fatigued legs - so much so that @entity43 said she wo n't take any chances			0
if she steps into the blocks and does not feel right , she will pull out of the competition			0
' we 're both not feeling our greatest , ' @entity43 said			0
for @entity2 , there is also an emotional component			1
' i went to bed so happy and then i woke up to do something i do n't want to do at all , ' @entity2 said			2
' if it 's in the best interest of someone 's job or the sport , that 's what i 'll do			0
' support : the two women have the same trainer and contracts with @entity181 anxious : @entity43 ( right ) is keen to compete in the @entity19 100m even though her main event is 200m as for their friendship , @entity43 said it has not been affected by the situation			1
they both train under @entity145 and were practicing starts together leading up to the 200m			0
' there 's never any question about any of that , ' @entity43 said			0
since @entity43 had already earned a spot in the 200m , there was speculation she might simply concede the 100m to @entity2			1
but @entity43 said the 100m is vital to her preparation for the 200m , where she 's a favorite to win @entity19 gold			1
' people may wonder , " what in the world ? @entity208 ( of @entity209 ) ran 10.70 and you 're nowhere close to that , " ' @entity43 said			0
' but it 's about making my 200m better and giving it my all			0
' the runoff is a boon for track and will be shown on @entity219 in conjunction with the network 's coverage of the swimming trials			2
' this will reintroduce people to the sport and showcase world - class athletes and great competition , ' newly hired ceo @entity224 said .			0
