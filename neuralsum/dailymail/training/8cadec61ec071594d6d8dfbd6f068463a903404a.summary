@entity0 is adamant @entity1 wo n’t be leaving @entity2 next month — despite @entity3 weighing up an £ 8million offer for the star defender			1
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 have all been linked with moves for the 23 - year - old , who still has two years remaining on his contract			1
@entity13 understands , however , that @entity3 boss @entity14 will be the first to step up to the plate with a bumper offer for the player next month			1
@entity14 wants a centre - back and @entity3 are willing to pay £ 8million for @entity1 @entity8 and @entity9 have also asked about the 23 - year - old , but he prefers @entity3 irrespective of what bids come in , @entity0 believes keeping the defender focused for the remainder of the campaign will no longer be an issue			1
@entity26 was omitted from the squad which drew at @entity28 in the first game after the august window closed , giving rise to the notion he was angling for a move south			2
but @entity0 foresees no such problems if bids are now rejected – due to the @entity38 ’s contentment with life in @entity40			1
‘ he ’s worth a lot of money , ’ said the @entity41			2
‘ but i am very calm			2
@entity1 is enjoying his football , playing well and when i speak with him he ’s happy here			1
he is such an important player for us			2
’ asked , in the event that a bid is turned down , he might need to again drop @entity1 from his side at the start of february , @entity0 was insistent			1
‘ i think he has learned a lot from this , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s not the first time a player has been affected			0
‘ others have been through these things as well			0
he came from the @entity62 finals with @entity41 two years ago and played so badly for @entity63			0
i have never seen him so bad because his mind was somewhere else			0
‘ you can see a bit of that in ( @entity69 ) @entity68 now , as well			0
if he can get his mind right , the goals will come again			0
@entity8 and @entity9 have also asked about the 23 - year - old @entity26 ‘ if you think too much about uncertainties , about what you ’re going to earn , it takes energy out of what you ’re going to do on the pitch			1
but @entity1 learned from what happened in the summer and he knows that if he ’s good enough things will happen			2
and this is the way he wants to do it - but now he ’s enjoying football and that ’s the most important thing			2
’ @entity2 face @entity80 , @entity82 and @entity83 in three high - profile knock out games early in the @entity86 with the two - legged clash with the @entity89 giants the toughest of the three			1
and @entity0 believes the exposure @entity1 will gain from playing in a game of such importance is such that it can only increase his chances of a more eye - catching transfer at some stage in the future			1
‘ he is a very good player now but he can be a world - class player , ’ the @entity2 manager opined			1
‘ that ’s a good opportunity to show yourself but you do this over time			0
‘ teams now will not see you in one game and then buy you , that ’s over			0
‘ then see you 10 or 15 times and you need consistency			0
your levels have to be very high especially in defence because they need people they can rely on			0
‘ that ’s something i think he has done better now than earlier in the season			0
