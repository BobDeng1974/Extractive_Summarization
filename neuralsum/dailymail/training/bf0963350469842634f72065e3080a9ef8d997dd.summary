@entity0 completed their @entity2 preparations with victory over @entity4 after two late goals in @entity6			1
@entity8 's visitors held their own for 80 minutes but saw their brave resistance broken by substitutes @entity11 and @entity13			1
both men had started on the bench , along with @entity17 star @entity16 , but all three were needed to stop the party atmosphere falling flat			0
late breakthrough : @entity0 took the lead through @entity11 ( left ) in the final 10 minutes			1
@entity11 is seen celebrating with @entity21 job done : @entity0 's @entity25 ( left ) , @entity23 ( second left ) and @entity24 ( right ) celebrate their second goal , scored by @entity13 ( no 8 ) heading for victory : @entity11 nods the ball over @entity4 goalkeeper @entity30 to set @entity0 on course for victory in @entity6 as with @entity4 's 1 - 0 defeat in @entity35 last week , it was a performance @entity8 could take heart from - not least after a pair of first - half free - kicks that might have given his side the lead			1
but it was still another loss and a fourth successive outing without scoring			0
as it was , @entity4 almost ended their drought in the opening seconds , when the ball fell kindly for @entity51			2
the @entity53 striker managed a clean connection from 25 yards but @entity55 was well placed to make the save			0
that aside , @entity0 dictated the pace and looked to starve their opponents of possession			2
for @entity4 , only @entity62 ' tireless running kept his side 's heads above water , with the captain covering every inch of grass and stifling a handful of attacks with timely challenges			2
battle : @entity0 's @entity73 ( r ) vies for the ball with @entity4 's @entity62 attempt : @entity0 's @entity75 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity4 's @entity78 @entity79 was leading the back - line well too , with @entity0 's selection of flicks and tricks yielding nothing better than a free - kick harshly given against goalkeeper @entity30 for handling outside the area			1
indeed , it was @entity4 who went closest to breaking the first - half deadlock from a pair of free - kicks won by the industry of @entity94 - starting for the first time - on the right wing			1
brother @entity97 's 20th - minute header , from @entity99 's tempting delivery , was destined for the net had @entity55 not made a smart save			0
@entity101 went direct in the 38th minute , whipping a shot to the near post where @entity55 again scrambled the ball to safely			0
@entity105 : @entity4 's @entity106 ( @entity107 ) vies for the ball with @entity0 's @entity109 behind you : @entity0 's @entity111 ( right ) chases @entity62 for all their territorial superiority , @entity75 's scuffed effort was the best @entity0 could do in response			1
as the hour mark approached , @entity73 saw what appeared to be a cross veer towards the top corner and thought he had scored until @entity30 backtracked and clawed to safety			0
moments later , @entity16 made his belated arrival and was almost gifted a bizarre winner when @entity97 's clearance cannoned off him and needed a sprawling save from the alert @entity30			0
@entity73 should have scored moments earlier but headed against the post after @entity129 's flick left him with a six - yard finish			0
the strength of @entity0 's bench eventually told , @entity16 's chipped through - ball teeing up @entity11 for the headed opener 10 minutes from time			1
he appeared to be marginally offside , but the result was sealed with a second when @entity13 raced into space before depositing a clinical low strike across @entity30 .			2

substitutes @entity11 and @entity13 settle @entity2 warm - up in last 10 minutes
@entity4 boss @entity8 can take heart from performance
@entity0 drawn with @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 in @entity147
