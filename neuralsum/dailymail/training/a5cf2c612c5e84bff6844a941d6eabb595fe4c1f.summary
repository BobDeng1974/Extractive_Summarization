@entity1 scientists have captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm , by studying the blue fluorescence that travels cell - to - cell until the whole organism is dead			1
researchers from the @entity10 and the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) likened the spread of the blue glow travelling through the worm 's body to that of the @entity17 , stalking death			1
they believe that the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people and perhaps even lead to an increase in life expectancy			1
the worm is pictured on the right is glowing bright , signalling that it is closer to death than when it was photographed on the left professor @entity34 said : ' together the findings cast doubt on the theory that ageing is simply a consequence of an accumulation of molecular damage			0
' when individual cells die , they trigger a chemical chain reaction that leads to the breakdown of cell components and a build - up of molecular debris			0
the molecular mechanisms of this are reasonably well understood at a cellular level but we know much less about how death spreads throughout an organism at the end of its life			0
in worms , the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm			1
the study , published in @entity65 , reveals that this fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling			2
professor @entity34 from the @entity72 at @entity73 , who led the study , said : ' we ’ve identified a chemical pathway of self - destruction that propagate cell death in worms , which we see as this glowing blue fluorescence travelling through the body			1
' it ’s like a blue @entity17 , tracking death as it spreads throughout the organism until all life is extinguished			2
' we found that when we blocked this pathway , we could delay death induced by a stress such as infection , but we could n’t slow death from old age			0
' this suggests that ageing causes death by a number of processes acting in parallel			0
' the mechanisms involved are similar to those that are active in mammals , confirming that the worm can provide a useful model to understand cell death in people			2
in worms , the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm ( pictured )			1
this fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling the source of the blue fluorescence was previously thought to be a substance called lipofuscin , which emits light of a similar colour and has been linked to ageing because it accumulates with increasing molecular damage			2
however , scientists now think another molecule called anthranilic acid is the source of the blue hue and the study shows that lipofuscin is not involved			0
professor @entity34 said : ' together the findings cast doubt on the theory that ageing is simply a consequence of an accumulation of molecular damage			0
' we need to focus on the biological events that occur during ageing and death to properly understand how we might be able to interrupt these processes			0
' the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people @entity143 , of @entity73 , is an expert on biomarkers			1
