the view may be spectacular , but this is one hotel that is definitely not for the faint - hearted			2
anyone booking in will need a head for heights and nerves of steel as they will be spending the night suspended on the side of a cliff up to 200ft off the ground			0
it 's called ' cliff camping ' and if you 're an adrenaline junkie prepared to fork out up to £ 500 a night for the experience , it could just be your perfect holiday			1
guests will spend the day rock climbing before abseiling down at sunset to a ledge bed hung on the side of a cliff on the @entity40 coast			1
despite the precarious position a hot dinner will be served with a stove hung off the side of the ledge and a full @entity22 breakfast the next morning			1
while toilet breaks are encouraged prior to the abseil down anyone caught short can be escorted back up the cliff or experienced climbers can take their chances from the ledge			1
sweet dreams : guests spend the day rock climbing before abseiling down at sunset to a ledge bed hung on the side of a cliff not for the faint - hearted : despite the hefty price tag , the ' portaledge hotel ' has already had plenty of takers a hot dinner is served with a stove hung off the side of the ledge and a full @entity22 breakfast the next morning bad weather is catered for with ledge covers to keep the rain off and help is always on hand with an experienced ' portaledger ' on an adjourning ledge			1
organisers @entity71 have two locations where they use the ledge , on the sea cliffs on @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and a cliff close to @entity79			1
@entity80 , from @entity71 , said : ' i have climbed extensively in @entity82 and over there it is quite common to camp on the side of cliffs during long climbs			0
' we decided to bring this concept here but not just for serious climbers , i wanted it for anyone who wants to do something different and has a head for heights			0
' we did a couple of trial runs at the end of last summer and they went really well			0
we will launch properly this spring			0
' i think this is something people will want to try but will want to do it with someone with experience and expertise to give them that reassurance			2
bad weather is catered for with ledge covers to keep the rain off and help is always on hand with an experienced ' portaledger ' on an adjourning ledge while toilet breaks are encouraged prior to the abseil down anyone caught short can be escorted back up the cliff or experienced climbers can take their chances from the ledge lights out : a one night stay is £ 450 for one person , or £ 500 for a couple ' initially it can be strange on the ledge but after a few minutes people relax and enjoy the experience			1
' we already have people signed up for the summer and even people who have bought these trips as @entity132 gifts			0
' a one night stay is £ 450 for one person , or £ 500 for a couple			0
additional interest has been fuelled after a pair of @entity137 completed what had long been considered the world 's most difficult rock climb , using only their hands and feet to ascend a 3,000ft vertical wall on @entity143 , the forbidding granite pedestal in @entity145			2
@entity146 and @entity147 became the first to free - climb the rock formation 's @entity149 , a feat that many had considered impossible			2
it took them 19 days and they spent nights sleeping on the side of the cliff which has got more people interested in high altitude camping .			0
