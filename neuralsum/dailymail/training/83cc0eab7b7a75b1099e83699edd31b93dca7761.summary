@entity12 initially did n't make the team after falling ill during trials and was the first person cut from the team			2
sister @entity13 says she started planning to give up her spot on the team as soon as she figured out her twin was sick			1
' i was real disappointed when i heard that she was getting sick , ' @entity13 said			2

' she 's having a great year , and i think when you care enough about someone you 're willing to make that kind of sacrifice , ’ ' @entity13 said			2
so on their ritual post-competition hike , @entity13 broke the news to @entity12 that she would n't take the spot on the team , and that @entity12 would be going in her place as the person who placed just below her			1
of course , @entity12 put up a fight			0
