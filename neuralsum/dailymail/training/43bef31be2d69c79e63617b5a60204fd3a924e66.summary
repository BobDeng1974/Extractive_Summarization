four years ago , @entity0 was hit by one of the worst economic crisis in history with concerns about social unrest and the country 's possible departure from the eurozone keeping holidaymakers away			0
with tourism being the country 's biggest industry , the country seriously suffered , but the mood here is changing			0
tourism will be up 20 per cent next year and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010			0
and now , luxury hotels are opening their doors down south to draw in the kind of crowds you 'd see splashing the cash in @entity25 in a high - end revamp they hope will inject some serious glamour into the country			0
back in business : tourism will be up 20 per cent next year in @entity0 and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010 with hoteliers hoping to redefine the south as the @entity34 ' we want to transform the @entity36 into the @entity34 @entity34 , ' says a local taxi driver , who had been out of work for eight months before securing a job as one of the new hotel 's private drivers			1
' we want this area to be a luxurious haven of choice for the world 's jet set , vip and celebrity clientele , ' he adds			0
and they 're not off to a bad start			0
@entity52 , a global beach club brand , has opened in @entity54 , a picturesque fishing village a few hours from @entity56			1
you may not have heard of @entity54 but that 's kind of its appeal			1
the eastern @entity62 region is a favourite among @entity56 weekenders , royals , footballers and @entity34 shipping heirs , who use the remote location as a relaxing getaway , making it the perfect home for the newest addition to the @entity52 family			1
new opening : @entity76 has opened a super trendy hotel in @entity54 , a picturesque fishing village a few hours from @entity56 room with a view : each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the @entity85 waters and a ' floating bed ' @entity52 was the brainchild of @entity88 , who became the largest @entity90 's franchise owner in the @entity91 in the 80 's			1
tragically , the billionaire 's daughter @entity92 was killed in a car accident			0
@entity88 decided that , rather than mourn his daughter ’s passing , he would celebrate her life for years to come			0
in 1997 , after a complete renovation , @entity98 was opened			2
the venue and its sister properties all over the world are a continuing homage to @entity104 and the @entity76 brand is meant to exemplify all that she was as a person ; beautiful , fun - loving , a trendsetter and cutting edge in every way			1
fast forward twenty years and you 'll find the famous beach clubs in eleven destinations worldwide , including @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , with @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity120 resorts to follow			2
with it 's all - white decor , infinity pool and super cool vibe , @entity124 - a totally converted 1970s building spanning 8,000 square metres - is a place to see and be seen			2
forget trying to wangle a sea view room upgrade because each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the @entity85 waters , as well as personalised mini bar , ' floating bed ' and @entity133 + @entity134 toiletries			0
well , if it 's good enough for mrs @entity137 ! @entity137 has been in @entity0 this week with @entity34 culture minister @entity138 , after meeting him in his office in @entity56 as she begins advising the government on its bid to reclaim the @entity143 marbles who need a shared pool ? each one of the suites on the ground floor comes with its own private pool and the balconies light up by night by night , the balcony lights turn purple , the @entity153 's beats subtly ramp up and the headboard lights dim to suit your mood ; and that 's just the standard rooms ( which start at £ 235 a night )			1
elsewhere in the 5 * hotel , there 's suites with private pools , rooftop terraces and personal jacuzzis			2
health and fitness play a key role here - you want to look and feel good sunbathing next to @entity54 regular , supermodel @entity172 , after all			1
the spa offers massages and facials using @entity177 products and next summer will see the opening of every woman 's dream hangout - a martini manicure bar			0
fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel 's jetties			2
you can reward your hard work in @entity191 , the hotel 's central restaurant offering a vast array of mouthwatering salads , gourmet burgers and the brand 's iconic sushi dragon			2
next summer , the resturant will offer gourmet dishes to suit the more sophisticated palette - think deconstructed @entity200 , sprinklings of caviar and plenty of lobster foam			0
famous fans : queen @entity206 of @entity207 , left , has visited and @entity208 once hosted the now iconic @entity76 white parties and often parties at the @entity211 beach club get in shape : fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel 's jettys ( or you can just lounge out there on a sunbed if you prefer ) for a more laidback vibe , head upstairs to the resort 's roof terrace , @entity225 , which offers delicious pan asian cuisine and fresh and fruity cocktails set to the sound of a live house @entity229 if you can tear yourself away from poolside posing and champagne spray parties ( the world record for bottles of champagne sprayed stands at an eye - watering 2,000 ) , a 20 - minute boat trip to the island of @entity233 is well worth it			1
a car - free island , @entity233 is home to trendy bars , delicious fish eateries ( we loved @entity250 ) , and cool clubs			2
after dark , you 'll find @entity34 shipping heirs partying the night away - and a 24/7 water taxi service back to the mainland beats rushing for the last tube in @entity256			1
yacht owners and local celebrities rest their heads at the @entity260 , which recently celebrated its 100th birthday , and designer @entity262 loves it here so much , he makes the toiletries			0
so who can you expect to sprawl out on a sunbed next to in one of @entity0 's hip hotels ? @entity208 is a fan of @entity76 ; in fact , the famous ' white parties ' , which celebrate the start of the season , have been hosted by her			1
coming soon : the spa offers massages and facials and next summer will see the opening of every woman 's dream hangout - a martini manicure bar drinks with a view : the resort 's roof terrace , @entity225 , offers delicious pan asian cuisine and fresh and fruity cocktails set to the sound of a live house dj by night eye candy : @entity288 , left , and supermodel @entity172 both love @entity54 prince @entity290 's godfather @entity289 , the exiled @entity289 , has a holiday home and yacht here , and his sister , the former @entity293 , loves the area too			1
her son , @entity296 of @entity207 , and his wife @entity297 @entity206 have holidayed here			2
@entity298 , @entity299 and his @entity301 girlfriend , @entity300 , are rumoured to love the super exclusive @entity302 , a ten minute drive from @entity54 - and it 's not hard to see why			1
the 38 - suite resort boasts a yoga studio looking out to undulating olive groves , a private beach club and a staggering 598 columns inspired by the architecture of @entity311			0
seeking privacy ? fear not , each pavilion suite has a private pool , housekeeper and in - house chefs who can conjure up delicacies using honey from the local bee keeper and wine from the winery down the road			0
but this calibre of service comes with an a-list price tag ; a night at @entity302 will set you back 1,600 euros per night			0
while a weekend on the ' @entity34 ' does n't come cheap , who can resist panoramic views of the @entity329 , cobalt blue waters and the chance of seeing @entity288 in his speedos ? eat well , live well : the brand 's famous sushi alligators , left , make up the menu and you can burn it off in a seaside personal training session on one of of the hotel 's jetties			1
