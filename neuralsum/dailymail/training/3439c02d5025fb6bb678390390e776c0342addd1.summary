by @entity1 reporter they look for all the world like a collection of flowers bursting into life			0
yet in fact , these are microscopic crystals grown in a @entity10 laboratory			1
measuring just microns across , they were created to assemble themselves a molecule at a time			1
the researchers have created a variety of structures resembling different flowers to create the flower structures , @entity19 and his colleagues dissolve barium chloride ( a salt ) and sodium silicate ( also known as waterglass ) into a beaker of water			1
carbon dioxide from air naturally dissolves in the water , setting off a reaction which precipitates barium carbonate crystals			0
as a byproduct , it also lowers the ph of the solution immediately surrounding the crystals , which then triggers a reaction with the dissolved waterglass			0
this second reaction adds a layer of silica to the growing structures , uses up the acid from the solution , and allows the formation of barium carbonate crystals to continue			1
the team say the work , carried out on glass slides , is able to control the process of crystal growth so precisely it can create curved and delicate shapes , that do n't resemble the cubic or jagged forms normally associated with crystals			1
' rather , fields of carnations and marigolds seem to bloom from the surface of a submerged glass slide , assembling themselves a molecule at a time , ' the team say			0
' for at least 200 years , people have been intrigued by how complex shapes could have evolved in nature			0
' this work helps to demonstrate what 's possible just through environmental , chemical changes , ' said @entity19 of the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) and lead author of the paper in the journal @entity76			1
by simply manipulating chemical gradients in a beaker of flui the team was able to create different ' flowers '			2
the shape of the crystals depends on a reaction of compounds that are diffusing through a liquid solution			0
the crystals grow toward or away from certain chemical gradients as the @entity35 of the reaction shifts back and forth			2
the conditions of the reaction dictate whether the structure resembles broad , radiating leaves , a thin stem , or a rosette of petals , the team say			0
a red coral on top of a green spiral created on a glass slide by the team bluebells in the lab : the researchers can controls the crystals to produce leafs and stem shapes ' it is not unusual for chemical gradients to influence growth in nature ; for example , delicately curved marine shells form from calcium carbonate under water , and gradients of signaling molecules in a human embryo help set up the plan for the body , ' they say			1
' you can really collaborate with the self - assembly process , ' says @entity19			0
' the precipitation happens spontaneously , but if you want to change something then you can just manipulate the conditions of the reaction and sculpt the forms while they 're growing			0
' increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide , for instance , helps to create ' broad - leafed ' structures			2
reversing the ph gradient at the right moment can create curved , ruffled structures			2
@entity19 and his colleagues have grown the crystals on glass slides and metal blades ; they 've even grown a field of flowers in front of president @entity144 's seat on a one - cent coin			0
increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide helps to create ' broad - leafed ' structures @entity19 and his colleagues have grown the crystals on glass slides and metal blades ' when you look through the electron microscope , it really feels a bit like you 're diving in the ocean , seeing huge fields of coral and sponges , ' describes @entity19			2
' sometimes i forget to take images because it 's so nice to explore			0
' @entity10 biologist @entity160 has shown that bacteria living in colonies can sense and react to plumes of chemicals from one another , which causes them to grow , as a colony , into intricate geometric patterns			1
replicating this type of effect in the laboratory was a matter of identifying a suitable chemical reaction and testing , again and again , how variables like the @entity35 , temperature , and exposure to air might affect the nanoscale structures			1
the team can control every aspect of the process to build the tiny flowers the researchers created vast ' fields ' of the microscopic miracles			1
