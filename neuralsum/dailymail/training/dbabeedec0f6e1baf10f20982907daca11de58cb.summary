by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 4:23 pm on 25th november 2011 the @entity3 movement , which promises disruptive flash mobs , consumer zombies and carol singing over the course of today 's sales , seems to be no match for the consumer might of thousands of bargain hunters who have turned up at stores in force			1
the group , which has formed on the back of the @entity19 protests , hopes to persuade shoppers to buy local and turn their backs on mega retailers			2
but at @entity24 in @entity25 , just four activists chanted ' boycott @entity27 ' and ' stop supporting big corporations ' as around 9,000 people queued to shop at the landmark department store this morning			1
occupy black friday : just four activists attempted to dissuade 9,000 @entity27 's shoppers from bargain - hunting in @entity25 early this morning diluted effort : the largely uncoordinated efforts of the mini-movement have so far proved to be no match for the 152 million shoppers predicted to hit stores this weekend stores across the @entity40 continue to brace themselves for potential unrest as protesters from the @entity19 movement urge people to either forgo the annual retail frenzy , or to support smaller , local stores			1
while there is little evidence of direct action so far today , each mini-protest promises some kind of surprise action on the day after @entity52 , which marks the traditional start of the holiday shopping season in the @entity40 but with thousands of shoppers turning out to find great deals this holiday , it looks as though @entity40 retailers are set to attract the @entity59 's predicted 152 million shoppers over the course of the holiday			1
happy camping : shoppers camp out at @entity65 for @entity3 in @entity66 , @entity67 camping for bargains : shoppers wait for midnight at a @entity65 store at @entity71 , @entity72 waiting for goods : these shoppers erected themselves a canape to shelter from the elements ready : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 ( left to right ) sit outside their tents while camping out outside the @entity65 store waiting for when the store opens at midnight in @entity85 , @entity86 while shoppers camped outside stores in eagerness , groups going under the names occupy @entity3 and @entity92 said they would focus efforts on @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , though the net covers most major name retailers			1
their actions are uncoordinated but hold similar themes of supporting small businesses while criticising the day 's dedication to consumption and the shopping frenzy that fuels big corporations			1
in @entity109 , protesters said they would drive to @entity95 stores to protest with other @entity19 groups from around @entity112			1
@entity113 is offering a ‘ really , really free market , ’ where people can donate items they do n't want so others can go gift shopping for free			1
demonstrations : protesters are driving to @entity95 stores to protest with other @entity19 groups on friday boredom : these shoppers in @entity71 , @entity72 are among thousands willing to sit out and wait for deals elsewhere the 75 - person encampment in @entity126 , @entity127 , planned to send ‘ consumer zombies ’ to wander around in silent protest of what they view as unnecessary spending			1
in @entity134 , protesters are planning to serenade shoppers with revamped @entity136 about buying local			1
fears that shoppers camping out for @entity3 deals may secretly be @entity140 demonstrators have prompted some stores to demand tents are removed			0
the annual tradition of bargain hunters hoping to be first in line is thought to be the perfect pretext for the anti-capitalist protesters to set up a permanent encampment outside businesses			2
one of the stores - @entity65 in @entity151 , @entity72 , claimed that having tents in front of the store is a liability issue			0
but , as this has not been the case in previous years , those now forced to huddle up with only blankets and each other for warmth , are convinced the protests have caused the change of heart			0
the @entity163 , @entity164 , group plans flash mobs at three malls in an attempt to get people to think about what they 're buying			1
‘ we did n't want to guilt - trip people at a mall , ’ @entity173 organiser @entity171 said			1
‘ we wanted to get at them in a playful , friendly way , to support local businesses			2
’ protesters say the movement should not take away money and seasonal jobs from the working - class majority it purports to represent			2
they want the corporations to be the focus of any protests			0
but organisers do hope their actions drive people to reconsider shopping at national chains and go to small locally - owned stores instead			1
that may not fly with small businesses wary of any association with the movement , which presents itself as pushing back against corporate power			0
‘ if you ask , a lot of small business owners identify as business owners , not specifically small business , ’ @entity199 , of the @entity200 , said			0
‘ i would like to believe there is a silver lining , but i do n't picture a frustrated consumer that ca n't get into a box store turning around and going to a small business			1
i see that person going home			0
’ online shopping : staff at an 800,000 sq ft @entity217 centre in @entity219 process orders as they prepare their busiest time of the year as @entity3 begins in @entity40 and @entity221 follows in the @entity219 trying to shop exclusively local neglects economies of scale , job specialisation and other benefits that big , multi-state corporations can bring , said @entity228 economist @entity227			1
' i do n't picture a frustrated consumer that ca n't get into a box store turning around and going to a small business			1
i see that person going home ' @entity199 , @entity200 ‘ do n't punish yourself by not shopping where you can get the best deal - that 's foolish , ’ he said			1
small businesses are not necessarily better employers in terms of wages , benefits , opportunities for advancement and other measures , said @entity251 public policy research expert @entity249			0
he calculates small ‘ mom - and - pops ’ , which he defines as businesses with fewer than 10 employees , account for nearly 80 per cent of employer firms in the @entity40 , but only about 11 per cent of the jobs			0
it 's all good : a joke sign is seen at an entrance to the @entity261 camp last month , with protesters asking shoppers to occupy something besides door - buster sales and crowded aisles of big - box stores crazily busy : people shop at the @entity269 for @entity3 sales in @entity25 last year ‘ sometimes we romanticise small business - and i say this as a small business owner myself - so that it skews some of our debates about economic and labour policy , ’ mr @entity249 said			1
‘ it does n't mean they are n't important			2
it just means that larger businesses tend to create a lot more value - added per job , ’ the principal of public policy research firm @entity277 said			0
' do n't punish yourself by not shopping where you can get the best deal - that 's foolish ' @entity227 , @entity228 the protests are largely focused on shopping areas in affluent suburbs home to big chain stores			1
as with the entire movement , the protests bring with them a litany of causes			0
in addition to protests of big chains , causes include clothes made from animal fur , @entity298 's , homelessness and , in @entity300 , the low gambling taxes paid by casinos			2
the formula is ideal for the occupy protests - many of whom have faced evictions from large - scale encampments in recent weeks			2
with a large number of people in a confined space , the @entity3 protests present one of the earliest tests for the movement in its new , fragmented iteration			2
sales : a woman looks at a @entity325 display in @entity25 - the city where the @entity327 began most protests plan to make a point and move on - a strategy they have implemented in some cities with targeted marches for specific causes since the camps were broken up			1
' sometimes we romanticise small business - and i say this as a small business owner myself - so that it skews some of our debates about economic and labour policy ' @entity249 , south by @entity345 ‘ it 's not about specific occupation camps anymore , ’ said protester @entity346 of @entity347 , @entity86			0
‘ it 's more of , you know , real awareness of what 's going on in our government			0
’ another shop local movement , @entity357 , was started last year to encourage people to shop at small businesses on the day after @entity3			1
but the occupy groups are underwhelmed as this movement was started by @entity362			0
last year , small retailers that accept @entity362 saw a 28 per cent increase in sales volume on @entity357 from the same day the year before , the company says			0
‘ it 's just another example of the banks and @entity140 trying to take the very real desires of working people to have a humane economic system and twisting it to their ends , ’ said @entity368 of @entity369			2
camped out : @entity80 , left , in @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity378 , right , with his son @entity379 in @entity380 , @entity381 , are ready for the @entity65 sales @entity383 , 30 , of @entity384 , @entity385 , knows well the trappings of @entity3			0
' look , some people have printed out the deals two weeks ago			0
we 're not getting to them			0
while we would like to dissuade the folks camping out and " occupying " @entity95 , they 've already made their mind up			2
we 're looking for the shoppers on the fence ' @entity383 , @entity384 a former @entity65 employee , she would watch troves of wild - eyed shoppers kick , claw and scrape their ways to holiday deals and is now coy with the details of the @entity384 protest			0
‘ there are some plans i ca n't talk about , ’ she said , but added the focus will be on people who have not made up their minds			1
