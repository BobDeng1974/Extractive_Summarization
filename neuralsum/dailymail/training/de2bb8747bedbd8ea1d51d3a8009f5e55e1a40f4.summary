by @entity1 - potter published : 17:00 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 05:48 est , 16 december 2012 it surely was n’t what she – or the publisher who stumped up a £ 400,000 advance – expected			1
but @entity8 ’s party - planning book has struggled to sell after attracting an avalanche of unkind reviews blasting its advice as ‘ glaringly obvious ’			1
if she is disheartened , however , ‘ @entity17 ’ is n’t showing it – and has even launched a tireless book - signing blitzkrieg in an attempt to turn things around			1
recipe for success : @entity8 signs one of many cut - price copies of celebrate her work ethic is hard to fault : @entity24 one day , @entity25 the next – and that ’s where we witnessed her irresistible , full - on charm offensive first - hand			1
whether the well - heeled villagers of @entity32 need to be taught how to pass the parcel , play conkers or sit on a hay bale is , of course , a moot point			1
but the @entity38 of @entity40 ’s 29 - year - old sister clearly believes they do as she hustles for sales in her charming local pub , @entity43 , two miles from the family ’s £ 4.85 million seven - bedroom manor house			1
and as £ 20 copies of @entity22 fly out of the door , who can argue with her ? she is a trouper , standing behind the bar for almost four hours , signing for the faithful as she sups stoically on a pint of iced water			1
‘ a whole five pounds off , ’ she tells me winningly , leaping through the hatch to pose for a picture			2
‘ and signed , too			1
the woman next in line buys six signed copies , then hurries for the door			1
‘ right , ’ she says gleefully , to no one in particular			2
‘ these babies are going straight on @entity63 for £ 40			2
’ discounted : @entity8 presented a signed copy to @entity65 on sunday reporter @entity66 her dour partner replies : ‘ i do n’t know if it ’s worth it , love			1
they ’re going for £ 4 a time in @entity72 ’s			2
’ the book is , like its author , pretty , slight but engaging			1
‘ how is your sister ? ’ i ask , enquiring after @entity81 ’s acute morning sickness			2
‘ oh , she ’s doing much better , thank you , ’ she says			2
how are books sales going ? ‘ oh , tolerable , you know			1
’ @entity8 obligingly nestles beside me , a petite hand in the small of my back			1
she is , frankly , impossible to dislike , and – next to @entity90 – the most flirtatious person i have ever met			2
flicking her hair like a show pony , she could flirt with a brick wall			2
‘ is n’t this fun ? ’ she gushes			2
‘ i adore this pub. everyone has been so kind			0
would you like a pheasant goujon ? it ’s my own recipe			0
’ was writing the book hard work ? ‘ awfully , ’ says @entity8			1
‘ but so worth it			0
i love being an author			0
this was my dream job			0
’ the @entity106 are clearly at home here			0
this is , after all , where @entity8 learnt to cook , working in the kitchen during her gap year as a ‘ ciabatta roll maker ’			1
@entity8 ’s parents – who are bestsellers , with their @entity116 business worth £ 30 million – have come out to support the cause			1
@entity118 , 63 , guards the bar , stolidly drinking red wine			0
@entity121 , 55 , works the room like a pro , matching her husband glass for glass			0
@entity121 spots me , standing alone , and barrels over chummily , tottering slightly on expensive heels			0
‘ i ’ve been having hot flushes , ’ she says , randomly			0
‘ are you local ? ’ ‘ no , ’ i tell her			0
‘ i ’m from @entity131			0
’ celebration : @entity8 , left , pictured at the launch of her book celebrate , right , in october this does n’t go down at all well			1
‘ ah , ’ she says			0
‘ i must go and talk to a friend of mine over there			0
’ she wanders over to the corner of the bar to pet a spaniel puppy			0
staff come round proffering canapes inspired by the book – @entity8 ’s pheasant goujons and what look like @entity147 smeared with cream cheese – but both are largely ignored			1
@entity8 is the star attraction			1
the other hit – apart from @entity8 ’s celebrated derriere , encased tonight in a green frock that sits slightly oddly with her @entity155 collar – is the ‘ @entity157 ’ list			1
support : @entity8 's parents @entity121 and @entity160 were at the book signing as a handsome woman of a certain age tells me , petting her labradoodle : ‘ @entity166 is especially good			1
the book ’s worth it for that recipe alone			2
’ she has a point			0
it is undeniably moreish : brandy , ginger beer , lime juice and @entity175 bitters			0
moreover , at £ 5 , it ’s possibly the cheapest thing on the menu			0
@entity8 is a game old sort and does n’t take herself too seriously , happy to highlight a parody twitter account called @ pippatips that offers such advice as : ‘ enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle			1
’ but she is at pains to point out that any guide has to cover the basics , writing in the spectator : ‘ if i were to write a cookery book , i would be compelled to say that , to make an omelette , you have to break at least one egg			2
actually , that ’s not a bad idea			0
or maybe i should write a sequel and call it @entity195 ? now that could be a bestseller			0
’ she also revealed that her father has a penchant for festive fancy dress : ‘ a couple of @entity211 ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit			0
’ but here he opts for herringbone jacket , navy slacks and tan shoes			0
the locals – all dressed identically , the men at least – mob him and his wife			0
the @entity106 are the rock stars of @entity32			1
the book signings finally dry up			2
@entity8 stands at the bar – still beaming like a professional ice - skater – until all the @entity224 head off home			1
in their wake , the pub empties like a bathtub			2
the barman murmurs : ‘ it ’s the busiest we ’ve been since the @entity232			0
’ only @entity121 ’s spaniel chum is left , tucking into a tray of cold goujons .			0

@entity8 signed discounted copies of her book at a pub in @entity32 , @entity25
' @entity17 ' has launched a tireless book - signing blitzkrieg in an attempt to turn struggling sales around
