by @entity0 the ancient @entity1 believed that when a person died , parts of their soul known as ka – a body double - and the ba – a person ’s personality - would go to the @entity10			0
and now a tomb with a remarkable painting of the afterlife has been uncovered			1

discovered : a tomb dating back to around @entity15 with a remarkable painting of a funerary procession ( pictured ) and the afterlife has been uncovered			1
here , the guard 's three sons make offerings to their seated parents			1
@entity29 's title can be read and a monkey ( top left ) perhaps indicates that the guard was married - although it could be a pet the ancient @entity1 afterlife is one of the earliest known recorded belief systems in history			1
people believed that when a person died their soul known as ka - or body double - and the ba - their personality - would go to the @entity10			0
while their soul stayed in the @entity41 , @entity42 - the god of the afterlife - demanded work in return for his protection , which is why you often see farming scenes inside tombs			1
statues were placed in tombs to serve as substitutes for a person			0
in order to reach the afterlife , a person had to have a pure heart as well as recite passwords , spells and forumlae from the @entity61			0
people believed that in the @entity65 truths the heart was weighed and if it was lighter than the @entity68 feather , they could pass on - or be destroyed by a demon			0
@entity70 and the sarcophagus was a requirement for being able to access the afterlife and the @entity74			0
the ' opening of the mouth ' ceremony was of importance as well as the presence of objects such as jewellery to keep a body safe on its dangerous journey			0
the tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries , @entity1 antiquities minister @entity84 said			1
@entity90 , professor of @entity91 at the @entity93 ’s @entity92 ( @entity94 ) deciphered hieroglyphs for @entity96 and said that the guard 's name is @entity29			1
while his name might be common at the time , he was of high rank , shown by the elaborate tomb and its expensive bright blue decoration			0
the tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of the afterlife and several inscriptions			2
it measures 12 metres long and six metres wide and was discovered by @entity110 ’s @entity109			0
it can be dated back to the end of the @entity114 period , which is named after the eleven kings with the name @entity117 , who ruled in the @entity118 to the @entity119			2
@entity120 , of the @entity110 said the tomb contains ‘ very nice inscriptions ’ of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased			1
professor @entity125 said that is ' remarkable ' that the full height of the wall is preserved , which is ' very unusual ' for this type of open courtyard tomb			0
the structure was found near another one dating back to the same period , which belongs to the head of the army			1
it was discovered in the previous excavation season			0
the tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries , antiquities minister @entity84 said			1
in this image , the guard ( right ) is adoring @entity42 ( left with the crook ) , shown as he is placing his palms towards the god			0
offerings of food - perhaps loaves ( which look a bit like doughnuts ) , water in a vessel with a spout and meat , can be seen on a table the site , pictured , was uncovered in @entity16 , around 18 miles ( 30km ) south of @entity18 , according to @entity1 's @entity19 that tomb is larger but much of what remains is mud bricks as ' most of its stone blocks were stolen and many of them are in museums all over the world , ' said mr @entity120			1
because of the blocks , archaeologists had long known that the tomb of the messenger existed , although it was not uncovered until recently			2
one panel shows the god of the afterlife @entity42 and with other figures processing with objects integral to the body 's wellbeing for eternal life			2
another panel pays tribute to the guard in life , showing his three sons offering him items such as incense and a monkey can be seen , which might have been a pet			2
@entity191 spell out the man 's title as ' chief of people who look after writings of the army , ' professor @entity90 explained			2
@entity198 of the @entity110 said the tomb contains ' very nice inscriptions ' of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased			1
the central part of the image is drawn as if it were a shrine and bears the name of the guard - @entity29 on the bottom of the ' frame '			2
the god of the underworld , @entity42 , is pictured on the right of the panel in a shrine and the guard is offering him incense and water the tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of what could be the afterlife			1
the blue colouring was difficult and expensive to produce , indicating that @entity29 was of high social standing			2
here , his charioteer brother beings offerings to place on the blue table , which is already laden with loaves , lotuses and a dangling milkpot one of the wall decorations is drawn as if it was a shrine and bears the name of the guard - @entity29			1
despite being an important bureaucrat , it is not known if his name appears on other contemporary monuments , but as @entity236 was ' excavated ' by early @entity237 in the 18th century , there is a chance that artefacts that fit with the tomb will turn up in museum collections			0
' once a tomb emerges lots of museums find they have a bit here and there - but @entity29 is not particularly well known at this point , ' professor @entity90 said			2
many tombs have images of processions which show family members carrying objects needed in the afterlife , such as intense and water			0
@entity29 's brother , @entity258 , who was a charioteer , carries a teapot - like vessel containing water , as the ancient @entity1 believed people needed a clean heart to be granted eternal life			1
a standard bearer from the army follows closely behind , although it is hard to tell whether the objects will be used to prepare @entity29 for his journey , or whether the scene is from the afterlife			1
' the grammar of the inscriptions makes it unclear if people are dead or not , ' professor @entity90 explained			0
' it 's hard to know if this is a funeral of the afterlife			2
there 's a deep continuity between this life and the next			0
' @entity16 was the necropolis for the ancient @entity1 city of @entity284 and site of the oldest known pyramid in @entity1			0
