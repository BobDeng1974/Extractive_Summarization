' i looked down and saw a big lump on my wrist			0
my body went into survival mode , and at the time , i did n't feel pain			0
' the 25 - year - old revealed the emotional toll a random attack took on her in 2010 , when she was left with head and wrist injuries her attacker was eventually jailed for four years , but the incident left her with both physical and emotional scars that would see her struggle in her next competition and only take out third place			1
the professional athlete was told by her doctors that she would have to spend the following six weeks , just before her next competition , out of the water			2
' i lost my rhythm â€¦ i realised it was going to take more than just natural talent and intuition to win this world title , ' she said of her time in @entity73 in 2011			1
