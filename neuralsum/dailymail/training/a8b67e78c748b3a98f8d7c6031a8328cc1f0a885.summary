by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 10:10 est , 7 september 2012 thousands of teachers have voted to go on strike over the ' erosion ' of their pay and working conditions , it was announced today			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) said its ballot of members had shown that 82.5 per cent were in favour of walkouts , with a turnout of 27 per cent			1
members also voted for industrial action short of strikes , with 91.6 per cent in favour , the union said			1
the result raises the threat of huge disruption to schools later this term			2
threat : thousands of teachers have voted to strike , unions revealed today @entity8 general secretary @entity28 said : ' the @entity8 is left with no option but to take action to protect the well - being of our members and restore their rights to do their job thoroughly and properly			1
' teachers are being undermined by a government whose almost daily criticisms and erosion of working conditions and pay , coming on top of previous attacks on pensions , are unacceptable			1
this negative approach to the profession has to stop			2
' no other profession comes under such continual scrutiny and no other profession has accountability systems based on so little trust			2
this is bound to lower morale			2
it is time for @entity36 to stop dictating to teachers and address the problems which they are creating			1
it is time to listen to the profession			0
' anger : @entity59 's @entity58 has said that the strike would be dangerous the nut , which has previously balloted members over changes to public sector pensions , has warned of joint strikes with the @entity66 teachers ’ union the @entity66 already has a mandate to take industrial action over the same issues			2
today , the @entity8 said the two unions will be campaigning together to ' ensure that the onslaught of attacks on the teaching profession stops '			1
further details of the campaign will be set out on monday			0
some 228,831 @entity8 members in state schools , academies and sixth - form colleges in @entity81 and @entity82 were balloted in total			1
the ballot result follows a warning by the leader of the @entity88 ’s biggest trade union of a fresh wave of co-ordinated strikes because of continuing anger over cuts to pay and pensions which was leading the country on a ' path to poverty '			2
@entity97 , general secretary of @entity98 , said there was a ' real likelihood ' of more industrial action before the end of the year , following last november ’s huge walkout by public sector workers over the government ’s controversial pension reforms			0
the pensions issue remains a ' festering sore ' among workers in the health service , education and civil service and could erupt again in the coming months , he said			0
the annual @entity112 is being held next week in @entity113 , when activists are expected to press for industrial action			0
mr @entity97 said public sector workers had endured a three - year pay freeze and face another two years without any increase , leading to growing numbers of low - paid people having to rely on food banks			2
the attacks on public sector workers are unfair , and our members remain furious and angry			0
there is a real chance of coordinated industrial action , if not this winter , then early next year			0
' there is a view that strikes are a waste of time , but i reject that			0
when people feel something is wrong , we have to protest			0
what else are we supposed to do ? shrug our shoulders and say taking action is not going to make any difference ? when enough people march or take strike action , it has an impact			0
' disruptive : there would be an impact on pupils all over the country if the strike goes ahead @entity66 general secretary @entity153 said : ' congratulations to the @entity8 on a positive ballot result			1
' this result is the reflection of two years of sustained assault from the government which has been deeply damaging to teacher morale , as well as to recruitment and retention			0
' on monday the @entity66 will be setting out jointly with the @entity8 the next steps to defend teachers from attacks on their pay , pensions , workload , working conditions and jobs			1
' the government has today called the threat of strikes damaging			0
' we are very disappointed that a small minority of @entity8 members has voted this way			1
industrial action would disrupt pupils ' education , hugely inconvenience parents and will damage the profession 's reputation in the eyes of the public , ' a spokeswoman said			0
' parents and members of the public will struggle to understand why the @entity8 chose to ballot their members now about pay and working conditions when decisions about future pay arrangements have yet to be made			1
