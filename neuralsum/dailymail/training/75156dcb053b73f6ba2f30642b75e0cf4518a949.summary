former astronaut @entity0 has said @entity1 must commit to building a permanent settlement on the surface of @entity4 and sending astronauts there to colonise it			1
the second man to walk on the @entity9 told a special @entity11 subcomittee hearing that the @entity12 needed to accept that crews sent to the @entity4 surface would not be coming back			1
instead he said the @entity12 space agency needed to focus on sending people to @entity4 to stay to avoid the huge cost of bringing crews back home			1
former @entity1 astronaut @entity0 ( above ) said the @entity12 needs to commit to building a permanent @entity4 base the made his comments while outlining his vision for how the @entity12 should lead the race to the red planet at the @entity25 on @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28			1
if private space venture @entity29 has its way , @entity1 could be beaten to put human feet on the surface of @entity4			0
it is aiming to send four people chosen from a longlist of 100 applicants to the red planet in 2025			2
the organisers behind the project play to send a supply mission to @entity4 as soon as october 2016 followed by a settlement rover in 2018 that would prepare for the astronauts			2
however the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011			0
lack of funding , no signs of technology development and an overly ambitious ‘ reality tv ’ approach have all been cited as reasons that @entity29 will never be more than a pipe dream			0
others have warned that the project does not have access to the required techology to meet its timescales			0
astronaut @entity56 , former commander of the @entity57 , is among the critics , describing the project as having a ' self - defeating optimism '			0
@entity61 of the @entity62 at the @entity63 has warned that the doses of radiation that the colonisers could receive during the mission could pose a significant risk			0
he warned that the @entity12 risked being caught up and even beaten by other countries like @entity70 who are looking at sending people to @entity4			2
the @entity74 pilot , who is now a campaigner for missions to @entity4 , said the next @entity12 president needed to commit by 2019 to building a permanently manned @entity4 base			1
in his evidence presented to the hearing , mr @entity0 said : ' if we wish to retain @entity12 leadership in space , i believe that early in the next administration , the nation must commit to developing a permanent presence on @entity4			1
' he added : ' @entity88 on sending people to @entity4 to stay			0
the huge cost driver for @entity4 missions is the cost of bringing everyone back home after a relatively brief stay			0
' i envision a program of settlement that schedules most of the crews who go to @entity4 will remain and establish a permanent settlement there			1
' the former astronaut , who now spends much of his time promoting the @entity12 space programme around the world , was giving evidence alongside two other former @entity1 astronauts @entity108 , who was the pilot on @entity110 , and space shuttle mission specialist @entity111			1
mr @entity0 , who along with @entity113 stepped onto the @entity9 for the first time on july 20 1969 , said that since the @entity115 , the @entity12 had failed to demonstrate that it led the world in space exploration			1
he said that repeating the ' flags and footprints ' approach taken by the @entity122 missions to the @entity9 , would not be enough to keep the @entity12 in the lead of the space race			1
@entity0 said the @entity12 space programme needed to go beyond putting ' flags and footprints ' on @entity4 ( above ) mr @entity0 said @entity12 had lost its leadership of the space race since the @entity122 missions to the @entity9 the 85 - year - old said : ' over the next few years we must choose whether we are to go forward as a nation and lead the extension of global civilization to a permanent presence beyond @entity136 , or to allow @entity12 leadership in space to erode over the next decades			1
' @entity12 leadership is inspiring the world by consistently doing what no other nation is capable of doing			0
we demonstrated that for a brief time 45 years ago			0
i do not believe we have done it since			0
' another @entity122 like mission to put flags and footprints on @entity4 does not ensure sustained leadership , and restarting a failed constellation program will only require one small step for @entity70 to catch up			1
' mr @entity0 was the second man to walk on the @entity9 ( above ) after @entity113 on @entity74 , but says the @entity12 must now focus on putting astronauts on the surface of @entity4 where they will stay for the rest of their lives mr @entity0 has compiled what he describes as his @entity158 , which includes using robots to build habitation structures on the @entity9 by around 2028 that could support future missions to @entity4			1
he said that much of this could be conducted by commercial companies and for scientific activities			0
setting out a timetable for the missions , he suggested deploying a cycling spacecraft that perpetually orbits between the @entity168 and @entity4 to reduce the amount of fuel needed to send habitable structures to @entity4 , which could be sent in advance of any astronauts			2
he added that most pioneers to the red planet would not be expected to return			2
he said that initially a crew of three could land on the @entity178 before later transferring to the red planet itself			2
he said that this would probably not happen much before 2034			0
he said : ' every four and a half years the population of @entity4 will continue to grow as recurring outbound cyclers bring additional crews of up to 9 new inhabitants			0
' the list of potential tasks the surface inhabitants of 18 might accomplish is far too long to enumerate in my remaining time , but i would just note that @entity191 , the @entity192 of the @entity194 mission once said that a single crew could accomplish in one week what took two rovers five years to do			0
' during his evidence mr @entity0 attempted to lighten the mood of the hearing by showing off a pair of planetary themed socks to those around him			1
mr @entity0 's evidence was briefly interupted when his mobile phone buzzed loudly , causing him to sheepishly fumble in is pocket			2
after 10 seconds of silence , @entity12 senator @entity208 , the @entity210 @entity209 chairing the hearing , asked : ' just tell us if that 's a call from the space station			2

@entity0 was giving evidence at a special @entity12 @entity11 hearing on space
he told senators that the @entity12 should focus on sending astronauts to @entity4
he said the @entity12 needed to look beyond the ' flags and footprints ' approach taken during the @entity122 missions that landed him on the @entity9 in 1969
he said @entity4 ' pioneers would live in a permanent settlement and not return
mr @entity0 outlined his vision for how humans could set off for @entity4 by 2034
he said three astronauts would first touch down on @entity4 ' moon @entity234
they would later descend to the red planet to live in a permanent base
mr @entity0 said the next president needed to commit to a mission by 2019
