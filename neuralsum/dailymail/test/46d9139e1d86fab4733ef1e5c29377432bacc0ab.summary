enter the term ' ceo ' into @entity3 images and you 'll be presented with a grid of smiling men in suits , most of them stock images , with a few snaps of @entity10 thrown in			1
scroll down and you 'll eventually find your first female face : none other than @entity14 , ' ceo @entity14 ' to be precise , a doll which first appeared in the @entity17 , dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase			0
the image of @entity14 is the 96th result on the page , and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of @entity25 that jokingly states ' women do n't run companies '			2
spot the stereotype ! @entity14 is the 96th image to come up on @entity31 when you enter the search term ' ceo ' , after rows and rows of grinning suit - clad men several high - powered women , including women 's right campaigner @entity39 , have re-tweeted the results of the search , which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace			1
@entity3 , like other search engines , generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words			0
the more ' popular ' and relevant an image is , the higher up the ranks it will move			0
after @entity14 , the next female - and the first human one - you 'll find upon searching @entity31 for ' ceo ' does n't pop up until several lines more of men , and is @entity60 , ceo of a jewellery company called @entity62			1
incidentally , a new study from the @entity64 recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias , and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace			1
shining example ? the image ( pictured ) is of ' ceo @entity14 ' , a doll which first appeared in the 80s , dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase noted : @entity39 was one of the many high - powered women to retweet the results of the search the study concluded : ' manipulated image search results could determine , on average , seven per cent of a study participant ’s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field			1
' earlier this year , it was determined by the @entity89 ’s @entity88 that for the first time ever , the proportion of women on @entity93 boards in the @entity94 had reached 20 per cent			0
of the images returned by @entity3 from a ' ceo ' search , only 11 per cent were of women			0
and unlike most scenarios concerning gender inequality , nothing is to blame here but a set of internet algorithms			0
funny side : one @entity107 user deemed the phenomenon ' hilarious ' in a nutshell : the @entity110 pointed out that @entity31 ' definition of a ceo was ' mostly white guys and @entity14 ' misrepresentation : others hinted that the results were woefully out - of - date			2

@entity14 is the 96th image to come up when the term ' ceo ' is searched
most of the images depict suit - clad men
new study found that results like these perpetuate gender bias
