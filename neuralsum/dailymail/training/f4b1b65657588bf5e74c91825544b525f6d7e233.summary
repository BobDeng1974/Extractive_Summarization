a lovelorn @entity1 man who asked the internet for help finding the @entity5 girl he met in @entity6 last year on @entity7 has found her - and she does n't seem too happy about it			1
@entity9 , 25 , gained thousands of followers when he posted a picture of ' @entity12 ' and his story of dancing the night away with her last december			1
she left him only with a first name , a hint that she lived ' in @entity19 ' and the alluring request : ' find me			1
' he has now revealed that online sleuths did , indeed , find her			2
and they mobbed her with so many messages that she deleted every single one of her social media accounts within hours			0
' the @entity28 thing was getting out of hand			0
they were starting to infringe on other people			0
they tracked down every @entity12 in the @entity19 area , which is a bit much , ' mr @entity9 , from @entity32 , told the @entity36			1
who is she ? @entity9 , right , has launched a @entity28 search for a woman named ' @entity12 ' , left , whom he met in @entity6 on @entity7			1
when they parted , she said : ' find me ' ' we found the girl			1
she is from @entity19 , she 's not there at the moment , but she 's sorta taken all her public profiles offline for a little bit			1
' mr @entity9 says he has n't reached out to her yet - he 's waiting for the online furor to die down			1
but , as one slightly horrified blogger points out , it 's likely she has no desire to to speak with mr @entity9 now			1
their romantic night took place nearly one year ago			1
' a year is enough time for someone to get married , go through several relationships , or even have a child , ' blogger amiantos writes			2
' or maybe it ’s just enough time for some lonely guy to work himself into a delusional fantasy that she ’s waiting on the other side of it for him			0
' even mr @entity9 seems a little sheepish about his quest to be reunited with the girl he had a chance meeting with a year ago			1
he told the @entity36 that he has turned down multiple media interview requests - including from @entity71 's @entity70			2
shortly after @entity12 was found , he deleted his @entity28 profile and the @entity28 event that invited fans to help find her			1
search : he launched a @entity28 search to find her - but so far he has not discovered who she is mr @entity9 says he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her			1
she 'd lost all her friends , ' he told the @entity36			0
' i just cheered her up			0
i sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at			0
' the pair spent the night dancing , drinking and chatting until 6 a.m. , when she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways			2
before she vanished into the night , she told him her name and that she lived in @entity97			0
she posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request : ' find me			1
' on a @entity28 campaign , he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone - ' and the good memories came sweeping back '			1
but he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words ' kitty cat ' - he had no luck			2
he spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on @entity28 in june			0
' but the timing was n't right , ' he told the @entity36			0
' i think this time of year people have hope for the magic [ of @entity125 ]			2
' and it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the @entity28 page			0
but while the story has gathered international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is a hoax - the mysterious @entity12 has yet to be identified			2
before removing the @entity28 page , @entity136 explained why he was looking for her			0
' i was hurt a long time ago , ' he wrote			2
' the hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was too much			0
for too long , this has effected my relationships , and i 've failed people			0
chance meeting : the pair met at @entity146 fireworks in @entity6 ( pictured ) when he spotted her crying alone and befriended her			2
they went on to dance and party before saying goodbye ' somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent , and this is a step towards putting that right			0
' while the main aim of this event has been to reconnect with the now infamous " @entity12 " , it 's also about me , finding myself and who i know i can be			1
i hope to find her			0
and along the way , find myself			0
' but he said he has no illusions and that he would n't be surprised if @entity12 had another boyfriend but that he was ' foolishly optimistic '			1
' the chances are billions to one , but i like those odds , ' he wrote			0
' @entity165 is me putting all my chips on the table because it 's go hard or go home and i am not going to give in			0
' he added : ' even if i could just find her and say thanks , because it 's been a life - changing year and it all started that night , really			1
