by sir @entity0 this is a massive season for @entity3 clubs and @entity5 rugby — and with a few exceptions my interest in the @entity8 is focused on how it impacts on @entity13 ’s selections for the @entity14			1
it has to be that way			2
it will be different and special this season and the scrutiny and debates will start the moment @entity21 and @entity22 kick off on friday night			1
now the dust has settled the truth is the three summer test matches against @entity26 offered no answers to key questions being asked — and they all concern the backs			2
ready for the battle : the 12 captains gathered for the relaunch of the @entity8 at @entity34 the @entity5 forwards are in very good shape — i would give my right arm to coach them — and the questions over the pack are all positive			1
can @entity42 get into a second row containing @entity44 and @entity45 ? could a fit - again @entity46 be accommodated in the back row ? where would @entity49 slot in , if he became available ? i have no serious issues with the pack and they will automatically make @entity5 competitive			1
there is depth , competition for places and their scope to improve over the next season , as a unit and individually , is very exciting			2
but to win a @entity14 we need to score tries and lots of them			1
@entity5 must be dynamic and pose huge problems in the backs			1
start : the @entity8 has launched again for the 2014/15 season with @entity21 reigning champions @entity67 will be exactly like the recent football @entity14			1
it will be the bold attack - minded teams with pace , vision and courage who prevail			2
i ’m convinced @entity5 have the players behind the scrum , but we have not yet got them on the pitch together and in the right positions — and some are n’t yet playing to their full potential			1
so the @entity8 this season , not least in this first tranche of games , before the @entity5 squad is announced for the november internationals , is going to be an important proving ground			1
all the @entity5 guys must raise their standards this season			1
there will be a big step up this autumn and then another step again at the @entity14 itself			1
it will be fascinating to see if those who need to put their hands up can show us something special and whether they are given the licence to express themselves because the clubs ’ primary concern is always winning league points			2
i hope so — there is a much bigger picture involved here			0
@entity107 : @entity108 has been widely tipped to feature for @entity5 next summer but has to perform for @entity109 @entity110 ( @entity109 ) @entity5 wasted a golden chance to blood @entity108 against @entity26 this summer despite a cracking performance against @entity113			1
so now he must make an unanswerable case with @entity109 on the fast early - season tracks and earn a start in the autumn			2
he can play anywhere in the back three but @entity5 will see him as a wing			1
where will @entity109 start him ? powerhouse : @entity123 is a regular starter for @entity5 with his strength and power but ' does n't frighten the best ' @entity126 ( @entity127 ) has great strength and power , but that does n’t frighten the best			1
i want to see @entity126 spin passes out off both hands and put in a few chips			0
i want to see him looking for space , not contact			0
i know he can do it and it will transform his game			0
@entity126 could be the world - class inside centre @entity5 crave			1
he is so much more than just a battering ram			0
starter : @entity144 has established himself as @entity5 's @entity145 as a world - class kicker and hard tackling @entity148 ( @entity149 ) i like @entity144			1
he ’s a world - class goal - kicker , tackles hard , has got attitude and can play centre as well			0
he is in my squad every time , but do i see @entity5 winning a @entity14 with @entity144 starting at @entity145 ? not currently			1
i want to see more craft and devil in his kicking and passing , asking more questions of defences			0
his bravery without the ball is indisputable , but how bold can he be with the gain line , how flat can he play ? player to watch : @entity166 has been troubled by injuries but is razor sharp when fit for @entity168 @entity166 ( @entity168 ) huge season for the @entity168 wing after nine months out with injury			2
he ’s got gas , wonderful feet and scores tries for fun and , being a glass half - full person , i love that			0
ok , his defence might be suspect and he could be vulnerable under the high ball but this guy can terrify defenders			0
it is important that he quickly resumes normal try - scoring service for @entity168			0
challenger : @entity187 will hope for a big season with @entity127 to challenge for a no 10 @entity5 shirt @entity187 ( @entity127 ) his game went stale while at @entity22 but the summer move to @entity127 , and the confidence of playing in a team more used to winning , could re-energise him			1
for me @entity187 falls between the physicality and goal - kicking excellence of @entity144 and the creative skills of an x-factor like @entity200 — but he has the platform now at @entity127 to take his game to another level			0
mercurial talent : @entity200 ( right ) could yet make a late charge on @entity13 's @entity14 squad @entity200 ( @entity206 ) like all the @entity5 no 10s could do with a fast start			1
conducted himself very well throughout last season so that slate is surely wiped clean			2
must be considered purely on merit now			0
i keep asking myself one question : ‘ who would @entity26 least like to see playing fly - half for @entity5 ? ’ and my answer is a properly utilised , fully motivated , @entity200			1
change : @entity218 of @entity219 will switch codes and join @entity109 in october @entity218 ( @entity109 ) i ’ve been hitting @entity221 and am impressed by what @entity218 could potentially offer at inside centre			1
@entity109 have said that is where they will play him initially , which is good , but i would fast - track him into the @entity5 squad anyway			1
i would also give him game time in the autumn internationals			0
we need to know sooner rather than later			0
@entity231 ( director of rugby at @entity22 ) i know @entity233 well from @entity234 days			0
he is a top - quality individual and one of the best young directors of rugby about			0
@entity22 should be one of the giants of the @entity3 club game , but the job has thwarted some of the best rugby brains around			0
which is , i suspect , exactly why @entity233 has accepted the challenge			0
it will be tough but watch this space			0
all @entity248 : @entity249 , a @entity14 winner with all @entity248 pedigree , will be the key for @entity252 @entity249 ( @entity252 ) @entity249 is not a ‘ great ’ @entity26 in the manner of a @entity254 or @entity255 but he is a very good @entity26 — a @entity14 winner — and you can gauge the whole - hearted character of the man by his opting for a team who will surely be battling to avoid the drop			2
there has been a huge influx of new players at @entity252 and he has a big role to play in setting the standards			2
@entity269 ( @entity127 ) @entity127 fans will absolutely love this @entity14 winner , and vice versa			2
a big tough mean @entity274 second row who wins trophies wherever he plays			0
opponents absolutely hate playing against him			0
he ’s 39 years old now , but when you have never relied on speed anyway , what does that matter ? do @entity127 start games with @entity285 or bring him on after 50 minutes ? i ’d start him .			0

@entity5 's @entity14 2003 winning coach chooses his players to shine
new @entity219 @entity8 season begins on friday
