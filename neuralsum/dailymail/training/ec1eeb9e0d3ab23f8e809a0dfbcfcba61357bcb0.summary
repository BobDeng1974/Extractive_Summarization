in its interim report , released on monday , the commission said on average female victims were nine years old and male victims 10 years old when the abuse started and that it takes men longer than women to disclose their abuse			1
the commission , which began its inquiry into institutional abuse on 13 january 2013 , said its analysis also showed 90 per cent of sex abusers are men			1

this pictures shows commissioner justice @entity28 in @entity29 ' many others are yet to disclose their abuse or , for various reasons , feel unable to come forward at this time			1

the commission said it needs another $ 104 million and an extra two years to do its job and reach more vulnerable groups			1
@entity42 and @entity44 chief executive @entity43 says the inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse must be given the time and resources it wants			2
' to not finish the job properly and completely would be an insult to all the victims of abuse and one of the greatest lost opportunities of our generation , ’ he said in a statement			2
brother @entity60 of @entity61 of @entity62 ( right ) with @entity63 ( left ) from the @entity64			0
@entity43 says the inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse must be given the time and resources it wants ' this is a once in a lifetime chance for the community to fully understand the devastation of child sexual abuse , its historic pervasion into so many different institutions and steps needed to ensure past tragedies are never revisited			0
’ @entity77 @entity78 @entity61 attorney - general @entity79 said the interim report made clear the enormous scale of the task being undertaken by the commission			1
' it is important that those affected by child sexual abuse and the @entity6 community as a whole can learn from the commission 's work so far , ’ he said in a brief statement			1
the federal government was considering the request for a two year extension of the royal commission 's december 31 , 2015 closing date to deliver its final report , it said			2
the commission ’s investigation into @entity101 has many different parts to it			0

the commission has held hearings across @entity6 into how religious , educational and youth institutions responded to allegations of abuse , in some cases dating back decades			1
the report says by the end of 2015 the @entity2 will have conducted up to 4,000 private sessions but unless it is extended for two additional years it will not be able to hold a private session for anyone who contacts them after september this year			1
' this will deny many survivors of the opportunity to share their experiences with us , in particular those from vulnerable or hard - to - reach groups			0
’ ' we need another two years to complete the additional 30 hearings we have identified as essential to fulfill the terms of reference			0
’ the commission said on average female victims were nine years old and male victims 10 years old when the abuse started in one of the scoping phase projects , school - based child sexual abuse prevention policies and curricula will be audited and compared with overseas models			2

the commission wants to see whether that process can be reformed			0
also under examination will be trial processes and how evidence can be given by child sexual abuse complainants for use in court			0
attorney - general @entity79 said the interim report made clear the enormous scale of the task being undertaken by the commission the commission has said children can help design institutions that are safe for them as they have the knowledge and experience different to adults			1
research into the views of children about their safety from sexual abuse in institutions has thus been ordered			0
the commission is yet to reach a view on a national redress scheme for survivors			1
' we have not yet reached a view on a national scheme , ’ the commission said			2

the @entity78 is facing a slump in donations to its flagship fundraising drive after the inquiry 's revelations of terrible sexual abuse of children in its care the commission is considering whether it is appropriate in principal to recommend a national scheme , if its possible to devise a scheme that 's fair to both claimants and institutions and how that scheme might fit with existing redress schemes			1
' the @entity2 understands the importance of this issue to victims and institutions and will consult widely as our thinking develops , ’ the report said			2
