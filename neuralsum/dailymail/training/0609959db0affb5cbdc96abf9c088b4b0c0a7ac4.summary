by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the most disturbing aspect of the @entity3 sexist email controversy has been the way the whole affair has been swept under the carpet by the @entity8 empire			1
the story involving the most powerful figure in @entity12 football has been practically ignored or given the slimmest of coverage by @entity15 and the @entity17 newspapers — despite dominating the agenda elsewhere			1
@entity15 ’s @entity20 packages have been pivotal to their sports business since the formation of the top flight in 1992 , while the @entity24 and the @entity25 became @entity20 partners in the current deal with their digital rights to show clips of goals from 380 matches			1
serious : the @entity20 have hired a crisis management agency to try and help @entity33 and not wanting to jeopardise these relationships with the @entity20 can be the only reason such an important football issue has not received the attention it merited from the @entity8 media			0
it ’s understood the message has come down from on high not to get involved in the @entity3 debate , much to the angst of female staff on @entity44 , while those writing about the beleaguered ceo have had their copy spiked			0
a @entity15 spokesman made no comment			0
quiet : the @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity15 , all part of @entity8 's empire , have barely covered the @entity3 scandal it has emerged that @entity54 , head of legal at the @entity20 who looks after corporate and commercial affairs , was involved in one of the puerile email exchanges with chief executive @entity3 and @entity61 lawyer @entity60			1
it resulted in @entity3 ’s now infamous backing of @entity64 ’s one - child policy to stem ‘ female irrationality ’			2
a statement in response to the allegations of a sexist culture at @entity70 made by whistleblower @entity71 , a temporary personal assistant to @entity3 , stated : ‘ the @entity20 continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit , regardless of gender			1
’ however , it will cause more embarrassment to the @entity20 that their senior in - house lawyer is involved in the exchanges when @entity61 have mounted a full investigation into @entity60 ’s role			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity81 , the award - winning sports journalist responsible for exposing @entity83 , has finally agreed to ghost @entity85 ’s autobiography , to be published by @entity87 after his confidentiality agreement with the @entity89 expires in september			1
@entity90 has started work with @entity85 in @entity92 , where the underperforming batsman ’s @entity93 are bottom of the @entity96			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. minister for sport @entity97 and culture secretary @entity99 , who never give the impression that sport is high on their @entity103 priorities , nevertheless turned up at @entity104 for the @entity106 final festivities			1
so hopefully @entity107 , who could n’t name last year ’s @entity106 winners when ambushed for a sports quiz , will be able to identify @entity110 as the 2014 victors when she is inevitably asked the question			0
@entity20 to stand by chief the @entity20 ’s audit and remuneration committee , who meet on monday to recommend to clubs what action to take against chief executive @entity3 , are aware there is little or no appetite among the 20 teams to remove him from office			1
but the least they can do is to take steps to reform the antiquated governance of the league which has just a two - man board in @entity129 and interim chairman @entity130 , one of his shooting pals			0
lawyer @entity133 was heavily criticised in the @entity106 panel report for the shambolic way he represented @entity137 in the @entity139 racism case			0
and it ca n’t be right that @entity142 chairman @entity141 , another member of that shooting party , continues to chair the committee that decides @entity147 ’s seven - figure bonuses and salary			0
doubt : there are growing concerns whether @entity33 's friend @entity141 should be a and @entity153 chairman the @entity20 clubs last discussed increasing their board four years ago			2
but when @entity157 chairman @entity156 recommended bringing in @entity106 chairman @entity158 — @entity3 ’s arch foe — he found no support			1
meanwhile , the @entity20 would not disclose who is paying for the expensive services of @entity163 , the crisis management agency brought in last week to reinforce the effort to keep @entity3 in office .			2

@entity17 and @entity15 have barely covered the sexism scandal involving @entity3
journalist @entity81 set to ghost - write @entity85 's autobiography
minister for sport @entity97 attends @entity106 final at @entity104
@entity20 unlikely to sack @entity3 after sexist emails
