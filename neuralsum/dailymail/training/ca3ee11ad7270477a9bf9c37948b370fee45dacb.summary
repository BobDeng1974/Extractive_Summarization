@entity1 shopping is undoubtedly stressful , but who knew it could give you a heart attack ? this month , scientists warned that air pollution levels are so high on @entity8 ’s @entity7 that spending just two hours there can cause significant stiffening of the arteries			1
in susceptible people , this can cause blockage , cutting off blood supply to the heart leading to a heart attack			2
cities are the areas where pollution levels tend to be highest , but people in the countryside can be affected too if they live or work near a busy road the effects on arteries lasted for 24 hours after exposure and were seen both in people with existing health conditions and healthy volunteers			2
it ’s the latest in a flurry of reports warning of the dangers of air pollution			1
exposure to fumes from factories and vehicles , particularly diesel engines , is now widely agreed to have both instant and long - term effects on the body			2
scientists from @entity44 even warned this week that wood - burning stoves are contributing to harmful levels of air pollution			1
government figures show that 28,000 deaths every year in the @entity50 are related to contaminated air — largely due to heart and lung problems and cancer			1
just last week , a group of @entity56 called for planning guidelines to be changed so schools and care homes could no longer be built near pollution hotspots			2
‘ although pollution is invisible , it can be toxic to the human body , ’ says @entity61 , professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at @entity64			2
‘ we are seeing many effects — the more we look at , the more we find			0
‘ it can make existing conditions worse and it can have a role in setting the scene for new conditions to develop			0
‘ we are finding that being exposed in the womb , or during childhood , can impair development of the lungs			0
' that imprint carries on throughout your whole life and raises the risk of problems such as asthma			0
’ one in 50 heart attacks that lead to admissions at @entity8 hospitals may be triggered by air pollution , according to a study at @entity91 , @entity8 the culprits are tiny particles of carbon , found in air polluted by traffic or factory emissions , known as @entity98 and , particularly , @entity99			1
these are particles less than ten or 2.5 microns wide — a micron being a millionth of a metre			0
when we breathe in , mucus in the airways traps dust and pollutants to stop them getting into the body			0
but @entity110 and @entity99 are so small they get past this filtering system			0
cities are the areas where pollution levels tend to be highest , but people in the countryside can be affected too if they live or work near a busy road			2
and while experts believe the most important step is to reduce car use , there are steps you can take to minimise the impact : for example , take quieter streets instead of main roads where you can — especially if you have a heart or lung condition — and during summer months , avoid running or cycling in the afternoons when pollution levels are highest			1
here , we look at the problems linked to the air we breathe			2
@entity135 will give you @entity136 polluted urban air speeds up ageing of the skin by 10 per cent			1
a study of 200 women in @entity142 found that regardless of lifestyle and cleaning regimens , those living in the most polluted districts had more damage and inflammation to their skin , which accelerates the formation of wrinkles			1
‘ pollutants seem to aggravate the effect of @entity159 light [ the component in sunlight that causes wrinkles ] causing inflammation in the skin , ’ says @entity153 , consultant dermatologist and @entity155 trustee			1
‘ this damages collagen , which forms the structural integrity of skin			2
' losing it is a bit like losing the stuffing in a mattress			0
it makes skin look saggy and older			2
’ air pollution has also been linked to melasma — brown patches found on the face			1
these are most common in women and are driven by the hormone oestrogen , but @entity159 rays contaminated by pollution may worsen the problem			2
pollution can also worsen inflammation in people with eczema			2
dr @entity153 advises keeping a good cleaning routine , and keeping skin moisturised			0
it may cause one in 50 heart attacks air pollution ’s effects on the heart are well established			1
in those with existing conditions such as heart disease , breathing very polluted air can trigger heart attacks and abnormalities in rhythms , called arrhythmias			1
one in 50 heart attacks that lead to admissions at @entity8 hospitals may be triggered by air pollution , according to a study at @entity91 , @entity8			1
‘ when small particles of carbon get into the lungs , they set up an inflammatory response and that releases chemicals into the blood which increases its stickiness , ’ says @entity208 , professor of environmental and respiratory medicine at the @entity211			0
‘ if you already have narrowed arteries , that increases the risk of heart attack , as it can cause blood clots			0
’ a study last year by @entity227 found that just a tiny increase in pollution levels — a rise of one part per billion — is enough to increase the number of adverse events and deaths in people with heart failure , where the heart fails to pump blood around the body as it should			1
some evidence suggests that air pollution is also related to heart failure starting in the first place , says professor @entity61			1
‘ that suggests it is n’t just what happens in the last 24 hours in an at - risk person : air pollution has the capacity to influence the cardiovascular system in the long term			1
’ @entity253 ages the brain some studies suggest pollution could have effects on the brain , including speeding up cognitive decline and memory loss			0
a 2012 study of nearly 14,000 @entity263 adults over 50 found those living in areas with high levels of fine pollution particles in the air — the type associated with vehicle engines — scored worse on cognitive function tests			1
the link remained even after allowing for factors such as age , smoking and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions			0
some studies suggest pollution could have effects on the brain , including speeding up cognitive decline and memory loss ( pictured above : smog over @entity8 ) the researchers , from the @entity283 , said the difference between this group and those living in areas with cleaner air equated to ageing three years			1
another study , of 20,000 women in @entity291 , concluded that living in a polluted area was related to faster declines in memory and thinking skills			2
‘ there is a theory about @entity298 ’s and pollution , ’ says professor @entity208			0
‘ but the studies are far from conclusive , and it ’s still not clear how the pollutants would reach the brain			0
‘ we know that when they are breathed in , they can theoretically get into the olfactory nerves in the nose and go straight to the brain , but whether this is true in relation to @entity298 ’s is not known			0
’ the threat of childhood diabetes children living in polluted areas are significantly more likely to develop insulin resistance one of the more surprising findings in the study of air pollution has been a link to type 2 diabetes			1
in 2012 , a study from @entity323 found that women who lived in areas with higher levels of nitrous oxides and pm2.5 particles were more likely to have high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes			0
meanwhile , scientists in @entity331 found children living in polluted areas are significantly more likely to develop insulin resistance , a precursor to type 2 diabetes , by the age of ten			0
the researchers suggested that this could be down to inflammation in the body caused by cells reacting to air pollution particles			1
another theory is that babies exposed to fumes in the womb tend to be born smaller , and low birth weight is known to raise the risk of type 2 diabetes			0
@entity348 : the proof in 2013 , the @entity350 — part of the @entity352 — classified air pollution as cancer - causing			1
as well as finding it triggered disease in the lungs , the group found a link with bladder cancer			2
some 10,000 people are diagnosed with this in the @entity50 every year , and the condition is strongly associated with smoking , explains @entity365 , professor of clinical oncology at @entity367			1
‘ once we ’ve inhaled a toxin , it ’s the kidneys ’ job to eliminate it from the body			0
' urine concentrates these toxins , so the kidneys and the whole urinary system , including the bladder , are exposed to higher concentrations of them than other parts of the body			0
’ damages young lungs for life air pollution can worsen symptoms in those with asthma , emphysema and bronchitis			1
hospital admissions for asthma attacks increase on high pollution days			2
however , scientists now believe that air pollution may also actually cause such conditions to develop in the first place			1
an analysis of studies concluded there was a higher incidence and prevalence of asthma among children who lived near busy roads			0
‘ there ’s robust evidence that cumulative exposure to air pollution during childhood results in reduced lung function , ’ says @entity408 , professor of atmospheric chemistry at the @entity410			1
and the effect is permanent			0
‘ even if you move to the countryside you wo n’t get better			0
’ that ’s because the lungs reach their peak capacity at 18			0
after that there ’s an inevitable decline , but if the lungs never reached their optimum there ’s less reserve for the decline , meaning a raised risk of conditions such as asthma			0
reduces male fertility a 2008 study assessed the fertilisation rates of donor sperm taken from @entity436 , the most polluted region in @entity437 , compared with the rest of the country and found significantly fewer pregnancies			0
researchers speculated that the high levels of air pollution could be to blame			1
another study , in the @entity444 , showed the dna in young men ’s sperm was more fragmented during winter , when air pollution was much higher due to the burning of coal			1
however , dr @entity452 , a fertility expert at the @entity453 , adds : ‘ while studies have showed problems in men who spend a large proportion of their time on a busy road — such as those collecting road - toll payments — i do n’t think the general population should be too worried			0
