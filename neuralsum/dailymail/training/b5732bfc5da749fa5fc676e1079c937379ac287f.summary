with its heady mix of romance , villainy and a quest for a diamond that once belonged to @entity6 , new @entity8 drama @entity0 is the quintessential swashbuckling tale			1
starring @entity10 as loveable rogue @entity11 , the drama also introduces newcomer @entity13 as the beautiful @entity14 who gets an unexpectedly personal look at the world of smuggling when she falls for @entity19 's protegee @entity20 ( @entity21 )			1
but while @entity14 is fictional , the women who inhabited the often - terrifying world of 18th century smuggling gangs were not - and frequently , they were just as frightening as the men			2
@entity27 's tale : @entity14 ( @entity13 , right ) gets involved with @entity11 ( @entity10 ) and crime notorious : 18th century smuggler and pirate @entity29 made a career from seafaring crime the earliest recorded female smugglers were @entity29 and @entity34 who eventually graduated from trading in counterfeit goods to full - blown piracy			1
@entity29 , who was born to a poor @entity39 family in @entity40 in 1702 , became particularly notorious - largely as a result of her relationship with fellow pirate and smuggler , @entity43			0
together with @entity44 and @entity34 , an @entity45 who had , while disguised as a man , fought in the @entity47 , she stole a ship named the @entity49 and rampaged up and down the @entity50 , harrying @entity52 shipping and sneaking illicit goods under the noses of local officials			1
but unlike @entity14 , who gets her happy ending eventually , @entity34 and @entity29 did not			1
by 1720 , the pair were on the run and were eventually taken by pirate hunter , captain @entity59 while enjoying a rum party with another @entity62 pirate crew off the coast of @entity64			0
although both women escaped the rope by pleading pregnancy , the pair ended their lives in squalid @entity64 prisons - in @entity34 's case , less than a year after her arrival			1
while @entity34 and @entity29 are among the most famous , most female smugglers led considerably less colourful lives			2
in the 18th century , smuggling was rife in the @entity52 , largely thanks to the introduction of the excise tax - introduced in 1688 to help pay for the @entity78			0
criminal : cross-dressing pirate @entity34 began her career in the @entity47 before turning to crime danger : although @entity14 's tale finishes well , most smugglers ended their days in prison or penal colonies initially , it applied only to chocolate , coffee , tea , beer , cider and spirits but was later widened to include salt , leather , and soap			1
worse , parliamentarians were unable to resist increasing it and by the mid 18th century , taxes on tea had skyrocketed to 70 per cent			0
as a result , smuggling gangs boomed , with women among those flocking to join them			2
much of the contraband trade was focused around the south coast , including @entity107 , the @entity108 and @entity109 , where @entity0 is set			2
as @entity112 writes in kidnapped : ' few places on the @entity52 coast did not claim to be the haunts of wreckers or mooncussers			0
' the thievery was boasted about and romanticised until it seemed a kind of heroism			0
it did not have any taint of criminality and the whole of the south coast had pockets vying with one another over whose smugglers were the darkest or most daring			0
' @entity127 was one of the commonest names for a bar on the coast			0
' risky business : an 18th century woodcut showing smugglers sneaking contraband goods ashore hotspot : @entity109 , where @entity0 is set , was popular with smugglers thanks to its network of hidden coves although barred from most of the more dangerous and arduous roles , women would work alongside the men to dilute illegally imported brandy before selling it on , or would gather and dry leaves to blend with smuggled batches of tea			1
later , as magistrates and law enforcers devised better ways to spot illegal cargo , women were , according to @entity151 , author of historical novel @entity152 , used to help sneak illicit cargo into the country using their voluminous skirts to conceal the contraband			0
even alcohol could be hidden under layers of petticoats ; decanted into a pig 's bladder which was then tied around the waist under the skirt			0
sadly , like @entity34 and @entity29 , @entity52 's female smugglers rarely got their happy ending			1
punishments were severe and most of those caught faced lengthy periods in jail or even transportation to @entity173			0
although @entity0 's @entity20 eventually makes it home to his love , for many 18th century jailbirds , an @entity173 penal colony really was the end of the adventure			1
@entity0 is on @entity8 , tomorrow and sunday night , at 8pm			2

like @entity0 's @entity14 , women became involved with smugglers
most did *n't* get a happy ending and finished their adventures in prison
some even turned to piracy , among them @entity45 @entity34
