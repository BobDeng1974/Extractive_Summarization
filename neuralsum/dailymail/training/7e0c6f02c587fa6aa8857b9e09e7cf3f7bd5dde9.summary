by @entity1 reporter published : 08:34 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 15:25 est , 11 january 2013 a top scientist who branded professor @entity4 ' more machine than man ' and a ' brain in a vat ' has angered a leading disability charity			1
@entity9 also claimed the eminent @entity11 physicist does not need the use of his body because his field of research is all theoretical			2
the phrase ' more machine than man ' was once used to describe arch villain @entity19 in the @entity21 films			0
anger : @entity9 provoked a backlash by calling prof @entity4 a ' brain in a vat ' ' @entity27 ' : @entity9 has sparked anger by comparing professor @entity4 to @entity21 villain @entity19 her comments were made in a paper entitled ' on @entity4 , @entity19 and @entity32 '			1
but @entity33 , director of external affairs at the @entity35 said : ' whilst we appreciate that ms @entity9 is an academic exploring issues of how minds and machine interrelate , professor @entity4 himself has said : ‘ people with @entity41 are just normal people with an abnormal condition ’			1
' referring to anyone who relies on assistive technology to overcome the profound disability and socially isolating effects of motor neurone disease as a ‘ brain in a vat ’ is dehumanising and disrespectful – not just to @entity50 but to all those doing their utmost to live and contribute to our society with this devastating incurable disease , which kills five people every day in the @entity11			2
' @entity9 's article was published on the opinion pages of science website @entity61 , on tuesday - @entity4 's 71st birthday			1
the physicist was diagnosed with degenerative condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a form of motor neurone disease , 50 years ago			0
she wrote : ' on this day it 's worth examining just who and what we are really celebrating : the man , the mind or the machines ? ' @entity4 has become a kind of a brain in a vat			1

timing : @entity83 's article was published by @entity61 on prof. @entity4 's 71st birthday ' in some ways @entity4 is , to borrow from @entity86 referring to @entity19 , ' more machine now than man '			1
' ' and indeed , because of his disability , @entity4 embodies the mythical figure capable of grasping the ultimate laws of the universe with nothing but the sheer strength of his reasoning - he ca n't move his body , so everything must be in his mind			0
' what else would a theoretical physicist need ? ' this month prof. @entity4 became the unlikely star of the @entity104 insurance wesbite 's latest television advertising campaign			2
the scientist is shown telling a packed lecture theatre that he has discovered how to generate a super massive black hole , before being asked what he will do with the knowledge			0
the scene then cuts to go @entity104 's opera singer - played by @entity112 - haranguing a couple in the street , before a black hole forms behind him and sucks him in			0
ad star : prof. @entity118 has become the latest celebrity to feature in @entity104 's adverts good radiance : tenor @entity112 , star of the @entity104 adverts , is sucked into a black hole professor @entity4 has been confined to a wheelchair since 1970 , but has still managed to publish several key works of science , including @entity129			2
despite being almost completely paralysed , @entity4 is able to communicate through special speech recognition software that converts tiny movements in his face muscles into words			0
dr @entity9 has authored several books and papers about @entity50 , including @entity136 : @entity4 and the @entity137			1

@entity142 , of the anti-abortion campaign group , @entity144 , has also blasted dr @entity9 , and said : ' i disagree passionately and regularly with many of the views that prof @entity4 expresses , but i would die for his right to express them			1
' i have nothing but the greatest respect for this incredible man and what he has achieved			0
to denigrate him for his disability and to belittle his accomplishments is to denigrate human life itself			1
' @entity9 did not respond to requests for comment today despite messages being left at her office in @entity163 .			0
