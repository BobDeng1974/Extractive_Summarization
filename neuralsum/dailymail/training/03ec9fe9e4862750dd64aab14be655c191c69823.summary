@entity11 , 44 , who was arrested last month on a single prostitution charge after a five - year investigation , was said to have raked in more than $ 10million in the 15 years she allegedly ran her high - end brothel , charging clients up to $ 2,000 an hour			1
but in court today , her lawyer @entity16 told the judge that the 44 - year - old - who wore the same black - and - white patterned suit she sported at her first court hearing last week - said she is actually on the brink of poverty and can not even afford to post bail			1
hearing : @entity11 was back in court this morning with her attorney @entity16 so a judge could decide whether or not she is entitled to court - paid defence shackled : her attorney , pictured , will also ask if he can put up his @entity30 loft as collateral so the mother - of - four can be released on bail in an unusual move with was dubbed ' unethical ' by prosecutors , he offered up his own $ 2.5million loft apartment as a ' gilded cage ' for her to remain under a @entity39 - type house arrest			1
a judge will determine at a hearing on thursday whether she can be freed on bail with her hands cuffed behind her back , she appeared with three attorneys , looking more like an ordinary suburban mom rather than the owner of a millionaire prostitution empire , as prosecutors allege			2
@entity50 @entity49 was trying to decide whether the ' soccer mom ' should be released on bail and adjourned the hearing until thursday			1
questions were also raised today about whether or not @entity11 is entitled to a court - paid defence			1
judge @entity55 said : ' the allegation is that she made over $ 10 million , possibly $ 15 million dollars , and that she has money " squirreled away "			2
' he then asked @entity16 why he should allow @entity59 - born @entity11 to pick and choose her lawyers after the attorney made it clear @entity11 wanted to replace court - appointed lawyer @entity63			1
' she does n't have two nickels to rub together , your honor , ' @entity16 said , pointing out that prosecutors have produced no evidence of @entity11 's so - called hidden riches and that she is entitled to free legal representation			1
the judge told @entity16 his client would not be getting preferential treatment but would keep the tax - payer funded lawyer until someone presented him with evidence that she was not broke			1
he also denied her additional request to interview other prospective lawyers within the program			0
later in the hearing there were ugly and farcical scenes between @entity16 and @entity63 as relations between the two went into meltdown in front of the judge			2
at one point , @entity63 dubbed @entity16 ' a hindrance ' whilst mr @entity16 he called for him to be removed from the case over a threatening email he allegedly sent			0
as he postponed the hearing , judge @entity94 ruled that both lawyers should remain on the case for the time being			2
@entity16 , an ex-police officer , is working pro-bono on the case and does n't have a lot of experience with criminal trials			0
racy : @entity11 poses seductively with her third husband @entity103 , a photo she posted online as she boasted to her friends back in @entity59 that she was ' building an empire ' in @entity107 in court last week : the mother - of - four attempted to hide from cameras when she appeared in @entity111 on march 6 charged with promoting prostitution @entity11 's bail was set at $ 2million after prosecutors told the judge she was a high flight risk since she had property and friends in different countries and has a @entity121 passport			1
it is extremely unusual , but not unethical , for a lawyer to post bail for his client as @entity16 has offered to do			0
it is also believed he will allow his client , her husband @entity127 and four children to stay at his condo in the city if she is ordered not to leave by the judge			0
@entity11 is offering to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet if the judge signs off on the deal			1
meanwhile , @entity11 's co-defendant , former matchmaking service recruiter @entity135 , remains at large but has hired a veteran defense lawyer , @entity136			2
it is believed she is planning to hand herself in today or tomorrow			1
speaking to the @entity138 last week from her cell in @entity140 last week , the mother - of - four denied that she reaped millions from a prostitution ring , claiming it was often hard to make ends meet and adding : ' i can show you my bills			0
' she added that she hated the thought of her children - particularly her nine - year - old son - knowing she was in prison , saying : ' i just do n’t want my kids to see me in here			0
' speaking from @entity152 - where she is locked in solitary confinement - she recounted the hours - long questioning she received from prosecutors following her arrest on february 22			0
accused : @entity157 , allegedly @entity11 's partner , has been on the run from police but she is expected to hand herself in today @entity107 : 304 east 78th street , the alleged @entity161 brothel where accused @entity4 madam @entity11 reportedly ran a high - class escort service @entity11 , 44 , was later charged with a single count of prostitution and believes the meager charge - which came after a five - year probe by investigators - proves they have nothing on her			1
@entity11 told the @entity138 : ' they ’re trying to sweat me out			2
they are clearly trying to break me ... i ’d bite my tongue off before i ’d tell them anything			0
' her denial comes after the @entity178 ’s @entity177 said it recorded her speaking of her close relationships with police officers and federal agents who kept authorities off her back			0
they allegedly kept her out of the frame even during high profile arrests , such as that of former governor @entity189 in 2008 , who was this week accused of tipping her off through a contact			0
she admitted that she does have high - profile friends , but would often exaggerate her relationships with them during discussions to make herself ' sound better '			0
she recounted the questioning by police as relentless and how her pleas for a lawyer fell on deaf ears			0
she believes the police were trying to force a case rather than having anything concrete on her , telling the @entity138 : ' if i ’m such a big , high - profile madam , making all this money , and they had to investigate me for five years , why did they arrest me on a single promoting - prostitution charge - and only after i refused to talk to them ? '			0

attorney tells judge @entity11 is broke
judge will decide later today if she is entitled to court - paid defence
alleged *accomplice* will hand herself in today or tomorrow
