@entity0 is not usually a man to miss a trick but he was oblivious on friday after becoming the first @entity3 to take two @entity5 hat - tricks			1
only when the man on the @entity7 announced the feat at the end of an over where @entity0 had struck with his first two balls did any of the @entity13 team and , seemingly , the entire @entity15 crowd , realise that he had also taken the key wicket of @entity17 with the last ball of his previous over			1
cue a subdued reaction from a bowler who had earned the acclaim of his home crowd at @entity24 when he took his first hat - trick against @entity26 three years ago and had also been on the receiving end of @entity29 ’s hat - trick ball at @entity30 a few months earlier			0
he is the first bowler to claim one at @entity31 for 57 years			0
this was a day of extremes to start the decisive second @entity5 — from @entity0 ’s hat - trick and @entity33 ’s first five - wicket haul in @entity46 as @entity52 were hustled out for 257 , to a catalogue of @entity3 fielding errors and two naive self - inflicted blows			1
there was even the surreal sight , late in the day , of play being stopped when @entity52 fielder @entity59 appeared to be struck by a piece of cheese thrown by a spectator on the notoriously rowdy @entity63			2
@entity64 will be happy to have taken all 10 wickets so quickly after putting in @entity52 under leaden skies but the @entity13 captain would also have been frustrated not to have dismissed them for significantly fewer			1
missed chances are one thing — and @entity13 squandered five on friday — yet there was also a rejected lbw that was shown to be out but which @entity0 failed to review , and an edged catch by @entity17 to wicketkeeper @entity74 for which no one appealed			2
bag full : @entity33 celebrates take the wicket of @entity79 on his way to a five - wicket haul breakthrough : @entity33 knocks over the stumps of @entity84 for the second wicket of the day home haul : @entity33 shows the ball to the crowd after taking 5 for 64 on his home ground , @entity90 hometown hero : @entity92 jumps for joy as he enjoys his best day of test cricket so far on fire : @entity33 leaps in the air after taking the wicket of veteran batsman @entity98 for 22 at stumps , openers @entity64 and @entity100 , who both badly need a score for different reasons , negotiated 15 overs to leave @entity13 in a position from where they should be able to dominate , even though @entity107 showed that he may well be a threat today with one or two that turned			1
@entity64 , without a test century since he last batted here 11 matches ago , needed a good day after increasing the pressure on himself by hitting back at criticism by @entity113 and then gambling on inserting @entity52			2
his decision was justified because his four - man seam attack delivered the goods on a pitch that did not have as much pace as @entity13 hoped but still kept the batsmen honest with movement off the seam and through the air			0
no one knew more about exploiting the conditions than adopted @entity125 , who showed he can be the enforcer but also displayed skill by varying his length and lines			0
@entity33 was on a hat - trick himself when he dismissed @entity131 and @entity132 in successive balls but he will not mind missing out on that after taking @entity136 ’s wicket to complete his best test haul			1
mr @entity138 : @entity17 scored a scratchy 79 as he help salvage @entity52 's poor first innings big wicket : @entity142 's emotion shows the importance of the dismissal of @entity52 captain @entity145 @entity146 : @entity13 's slips cordon erupts after @entity148 takes the catch to dismiss @entity145 leader of the attack : while his colleagues shone on day one , @entity142 chipped in with two wickets limbering up : @entity13 keeper @entity74 loosens up his back during play at @entity31 early win : @entity13 captain @entity64 won the toss and sent @entity52 in to bat in @entity158 old mate : @entity64 runs into former spinner @entity160 , on duty for the @entity162 , after the toss job done : @entity64 negotiated 15 overs from the @entity166 before stumps as @entity13 finished 36 for 0 without loss : @entity100 ( left ) is 21 not out and @entity64 is 14 not out at stumps it was quite a performance from a man who had not played a @entity46 in seven years before returning at @entity171 ’s last week and who could easily have been lost to the game when he left @entity174 two years ago			1
and it was achieved in front of his father @entity177 , who has recovered from serious illness			0
@entity33 ’s tally could so easily have been even better as he twice should have claimed @entity17			0
the @entity166 has hit 36 test hundreds , including one at @entity183 in the first test , and a further 46 half - centuries but he can rarely have batted quite as badly in reaching 79 as he did here after being given four lives by @entity13			1
one of the greatest of all batsmen should have been run out before he had scored and gave three other chances before @entity190 , in his 100th test , claimed a sharp catch to send him on his way			0
that was the first of four wickets to fall in nine balls after tea as any hopes @entity52 had of embarrassing @entity64 with a big score evaporated and the tourists then failed to make any inroads when @entity13 batted			2
@entity64 and his team have the chance today to bat @entity52 out of this game and the series .			0
