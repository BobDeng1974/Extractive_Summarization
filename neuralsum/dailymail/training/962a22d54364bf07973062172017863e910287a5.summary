by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is a very different striker to @entity3 but wants to make a similar impact to that of his fellow countryman at @entity7			1
the 27 - year - old marked his debut with a superbly struck volley in the comfortable win at @entity12 on saturday , with obvious comparisons immediately struck			1
@entity3 ’s seven crucial goals at the back end of the 2006 - 07 season - most notably a winner away at @entity17 - kept the @entity7 in the @entity18			1
delighted : @entity2 impressed on his debut for the @entity7 as he scored a superb volley against @entity12 fans favourite : despite his short stay at the club @entity3 was and remains highly regarded by @entity7 fans @entity2 is the sort of player , dropping off the front man , who should see that @entity28 does n’t have any such worries this year			1
he was majestic when pulling the strings from deep at @entity31 and offered reasons to believe he is the man to bring excitement back to @entity34 - as requested by the club ’s board in the summer			1
‘ @entity3 is a star			1
the @entity38 with @entity17 , everything with @entity40 , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ i am very different			2
i know he was very popular with @entity7 fans			1
i hope i can have the same impact			2
‘ he scored some very important goals for @entity7 but i am another person , another player so i want to go step by step			2
’ @entity2 speaks regularly with @entity47 - the pair go out to dinner together - and revealed that the @entity40 striker believed @entity7 was the right club for him			1
role model : @entity2 is hoping to enjoy similar success to what his fellow countryman @entity3 had at @entity7 briefly a @entity55 player in 2008 , noteworthy for a sumptuous free - kick against @entity57 , @entity2 has endured a turbulent couple of years - the low point of which was when @entity60 refused to pick him following a series of very public disputes			1
after a year back home in @entity64 , @entity2 now appears to be back - although has never scored enough goals throughout his career			1
new coach @entity67 has been working alongside him in the week and was visibly delighted when @entity2 flashed home the opener at @entity12			0
that was because the pair had rehearsed the exact scenario time and again in training			0
‘ he [ @entity67 ] has really helped me			0
we have been practicing volleys like that in training			0
from the the edge of the box - the same			2
he was very happy and he celebrated the goal too			0
’ @entity67 was n’t the only one who looked pleased			0
@entity28 ’s face was a picture as the goals went in as he seems to have hit upon a formula which may yield both results and pleasure in equal measure			0
asked about @entity2 , @entity28 said : ‘ he likes to come off and start up the top and play coming off and find spaces that none of our players are like that			0
‘ he ’s a different kind of player to what we ’ve had before			0
it ’s very important in terms of wanting to play against a certain team and what strengths he would give you by playing against that certain team			0
‘ he has some strengths which other players at the club do n’t have and i thought he showed that			0

the @entity64 hopes to have a similar impact to what @entity3 had when he played for @entity7
@entity3 was a firm fans favourite during his spell at @entity34
