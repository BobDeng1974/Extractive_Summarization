when it comes to taking the best photographs , there 's nothing better than torrential rain			2
new research from @entity6 reveals that images of weather beat family , food and weddings as the most impressive pictures online			1
travellers aged 25 - 34 year olds are most likely to take ' wethies ' ( weather photos ) with half taking one at least once a week and one in ten every day			1
more than a third admit a good weather photo is one of their favourite things to see online and 40 per cent say they are more impressive because of the high level of skill necessary to take			1
however , despite sunsets ( 52 per cent ) , snow ( 39 per cent ) and rainbows ( 31 per cent ) topping the list of most photographed weather , three in five feel that their pictures do n't do the natural phenomenon justice			1
when asked which weather condition would be hardest to photograph , over half of respondents agreed on lightning			1
all the colours in the rainbow : a multicoloured streak across the sky frames a barn in @entity64 , @entity27 sometimes the calmest weather shots can be the most spellbinding			1
here is @entity67 and village in @entity69 in morning mist a stab in the dark : this incredible image shows cloud - to - ground lightning bolts striking a field in eastern @entity76 across the country , @entity77 were found to be the most likely to shoot the weather , with 41 per cent taking pictures up to seven times a week ; this drops to just 24 per cent in @entity83 and 26 per cent in the @entity84			1
one in ten @entity33 now say they only take weather photographs when they 're on holiday			2
@entity6 weather photography expert , @entity88 says : ' i 've been photographing weather for over 30 years and it never ceases to amaze me			1
it is an ever - changing subject and has the ability to take your breath away with its beauty and power			2
' it 's great to see people investing in their pictures and more and more people using dslrs to capture the weather in all its glory - especially as we are seeing more extreme weather phenomena around the world			1
' light and dark : multiple tornadoes are captured illuminated by lightning in a memorable shot by weather photographer @entity88 perfectly simple : cattle grazing below the perigee moon or supermoon , in the @entity114 @entity6 analysis of @entity117 conversations confirms that weather is a growing topic for discussion amongst @entity33			1
conversation peaked in early august and early october , most likely due to the unusually warm spells , with mentions of ' cold ' and ' weather ' increasing by more than 800 per cent in one week between september 27th and october 6th			1
out of @entity117 weather mentions , research shows that sunsets were more than twice the amount talked about than sunrises			2
if all this talk of weather inspires you to want to get out there with your camera , weather photographers , @entity135 and @entity136 provide their top tips forgetting the perfect shot : @entity141 seascape : this was taken in march this year at sunset at @entity144 with an incoming tide stormy seas : waves explode over a seawall and into @entity149 , @entity150 as @entity151 approaches on september 12 , 2008 1			1
@entity152 ( 41 per cent ) 2			2
@entity153 ( 13 per cent ) 3			2
weddings ( 6 per cent ) 4			2
night out ( 5 per cent ) 5			0
@entity155 ( 5 per cent ) 6			0
sports events ( 3 per cent ) 7			0
babies ( 3 per cent ) sunsets : keep a mental note of locations and subjects close to home or your work place that would look good at sunset			0
@entity166 out when there is medium cloud cover and do n't fill the frame with just the sky , look for silhouettes that allow light to pass through its details allowing the subject to be recognisable such as a leafless tree or pier			0
mist : to capture mist , an early start is essential			0
longer focal lengths will help compress perspective and allow you to highlight subjects and shapes shrouded in the mist			0
@entity185 : often the best dawn colour is a good 15 - 30 minutes before the sun actually appears			0
in this type of low light , exposure time will be slow , so always use the stability of a tripod to ensure your images are shake free			0
rainbows : try attaching a polarising filter - using one can help saturate the rainbow 's colours and make it standout out even more			0
use the filter with care , though ; as they can also have the reserve effect and make them disappear if rotated incorrectly ! storms : keep a close eye on the forecast for strong winds , sunshine and showers and remember to pack something to cover your camera in case of a deluge			0
in the case of lightning avoid open areas as metal objects such as tripods and camera do n't mix ! fog : @entity221 acts as a giant diffuser and simplifies the scene so look for narrow streets and alleyways or an avenue of trees in the local park			0
shoot into the sun and if you are lucky try to get the rising sun burning through the fog			0
