@entity0 and @entity1 retained their positions as the most respected brands in the newly released 2014 @entity5 's survey			1
every year the @entity5 's consulting firm polls 10,000 corporate executives to find the country 's leading brands			1
the brands are then ranked by how familiar they are , how favorably people view them , their management , and investment potential			1
@entity0 topped @entity16 s 2014 list of @entity18 s most respected brands ahead of rival pepsi the @entity20 reports that to be considered a company needs to be publicly most respected : 1			2
@entity30 least respected : 1			2
@entity40 traded and tracked by @entity5 for over five years			2
they must also have a corporate brand			0
the poll begins with 500 companies for consideration then cuts it down to the 100 brands that have the highest familiarity			1
both @entity0 and @entity1 polled highly , though how favorably people perceive them has dipped in recent years as many now view their products as contributing to obesity , @entity49 reports			1
rounding out the top ten were @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity54 , and @entity30			1
@entity28 's ranking was of particular interest since ceo @entity57 is still under pressure to see if he can match the performance of late co-founder and ceo @entity60			0
ironically , thought @entity39 was ranked among the least respected companies simply becoming a recognized brand is considered something of a milestone by the company itself			1
' it is actually a counter-intuitive that they even show up here , as their brand is becoming more powerful year over year , ' the report notes			0
however it could be more recognized because of headlines last year regarding the brand 's sluggish sales			0
assuming they focus on their public perception , the brand should be able to remove itself from the list			0
appearing for the second year in the lest respected spot was @entity31			0
@entity37 was also ranked poorly , as the company 's image was damaged two years ago in an attempt to reinvent themselves as a more upscale brand			2
they have since reverted to their prior identity in stores , but their favorability rating hovers at 60 per cent			0
also on the bottom of the list were @entity34 's , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity38 , and @entity40 .			0
