by @entity0 click here to read @entity3 's @entity2 with @entity4 : ' i 'm not arrogant ... i 'm just a happy guy ' there will come a point today , as @entity9 ’s team bus snakes through the streets of @entity11 , when @entity4 will zone out from those around him			1
all conversation will stop , his phone will come out and @entity4 will devote all concentration to the small screen in front of him			1
if your instinct is to say this is a lack of manners , think again			2
it ’s actually the start of an intricate pre-match routine , designed to bring him to fever pitch			2
for on @entity4 ’s phone is a compilation of the 28 goals he has scored in his 15 months as a @entity9 player			1
he analyses them relentlessly , imagining how the next header , volley or tap - in will look			2
clearly the studying is paying off			0
sturr it up ! @entity4 is the league 's leading @entity36 goalscorer with 18 goals so far this season inspiration : @entity4 watches a compilation of his goals ahead of games to get him in the scoring mood can they do it ? liverpool travel to @entity11 on saturday still in the race for the @entity48 title ‘ i watch the goals to get me in the mood and to give myself a vision of how i want the game to go , ’ @entity4 explains , as he holds court in the media room at @entity9 ’s @entity52 training base			1
‘ i have got more clips as the season has gone on , but that ’s good			2
‘ i will do the same routine against @entity11			1
the clips now last around 15 - 20 minutes which is normally what the coach ride to a stadium takes , so it is perfect			2
i still get the same feeling every time i watch the video back			0
‘ after that in the changing room , i will be dancing and joking			0
a lot of players are straight - faced and serious , some are the opposite			0
it ’s like that until about 10 minutes before kick - off and i am in the zone			0
then there is no more joking about			0
’ this is a candid insight into the workings of a young man for whom the next few months will be momentous			0
as @entity84 ’s main striker , expectation will grow the closer the @entity85 comes into view but , before that , he could help his club achieve something remarkable			1
main man : @entity4 looks set to lead @entity84 's attack at the @entity85 in @entity92 , despite his dodgy celebrations dynamic duo : @entity4 has formed the @entity48 's most potent partnership with @entity96 ( @entity97 ) old enemy : united players are furious after @entity4 wins a penalty in @entity9 's 4 - 1 victory at @entity102 @entity103 @entity4 19 ( 2 ) 18 7 3 @entity9 might be outsiders but there is no disputing they are in the thick of a pulsating title race and @entity4 has done as much as anyone to get them there			1
his fortunes have mirrored that of his team , on a constant upward spiral since the turn of last year			0
if it was initially doubted whether @entity4 , who had been saddled with a reputation for being difficult , would be a good fit at @entity9 , it is now impossible to imagine @entity120 ’s side operating without the 24 - year - old			1
@entity123 ’s stage suits him			0
before he headed north , he spoke with a striker who knew what relentless goalscoring in a red shirt could do			2
@entity129 ’s love affair with the @entity130 ended the day he joined @entity131 in 2011 for £ 50million but that did not stop him giving @entity133 some significant advice			1
raw talent : @entity4 began his professional career at @entity137 @entity138 brother : @entity4 moved to @entity131 but became frustrated with his lack of playing time red leader : @entity4 has found the perfect place to develop his game at @entity123 ‘ he always spoke very highly about @entity9 , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ when we were at @entity131 together he would say , “ @entity9 are amazing ” , and it was n’t just him — it was @entity150 as well			1
they both said , “ that club is the best i have played for ”			1
‘ they said the fans will make you feel amazing and , at the time , i thought i need a bit of that in my life because i was low right then			0
‘ i need to feel good about myself , so it was an easy decision to come here			0
my dad ( @entity161 ) , my uncle ( @entity162 , the former @entity163 striker ) and i all shared the same opinion : this was the best place to go			2
when @entity9 came in , it was one of those situations that i just wanted to get up the @entity167 as quick as possible , sign on the dotted line and get to work			2
training day : @entity129 ( c ) told @entity4 that @entity9 were the best club he ever played for reversal of fortune : @entity129 was not the same player after leaving @entity9 for @entity131 for £ 50m in 2011 take a bow : @entity4 moved in the opposite direction and scored on his debut against @entity175 ‘ i was desperate to get here and show what i could do			1
i was hungry and i am still hungry			0
there is so much for us to achieve			0
’ what they might achieve in the next nine games , starting against @entity11 , has supporters daring to dream			1
@entity4 was only eight months old when @entity9 last ruled the land but this , perhaps , is their best chance since 1990 and if he and @entity96 keep scoring , anything is possible			1
between them they have plundered 43 goals in the @entity48 but that has not stopped the perception that there is some friction between the pair , not least when @entity96 has been caught on camera berating his partner for not passing			1
friend or foe ? there have been question marks over the relationship between @entity4 and @entity96 license to thrill : @entity4 has nicknamed @entity205 ' @entity204 ' , because he can do everything do you wan na see a trick ? meanwhile , @entity4 as labelled @entity210 ' @entity209 ' for his magical passes ‘ yeah well , i do the same to him ! ’ @entity4 responds			1
‘ @entity96 does have a go at players but that ’s because he wants the best			2
i want the best , too , the same as @entity216 ( @entity205 )			0
we are at a stage now where we have to push everyone to their maximum			0
‘ some players respond to shouting , some do n’t			0
everyone is different and that is one of a manager ’s strengths to understand that some do n’t respond to that			0
‘ but i feel that as a team , if we push each other to our limits , we can achieve something			0
’ having dubbed @entity205 ‘ @entity204 ’ — @entity4 feels there is nothing @entity9 ’s captain ca n’t do — and @entity210 ‘ @entity209 ’ as he is ‘ a magician ’ , @entity4 is working on a nickname for @entity96 but only once they have taken care of the serious business			1
confident : despite manager @entity120 playing down title talk , @entity4 insists @entity9 are in the mix favourite : @entity4 rates his glancing header in the 3 - 3 derby against @entity244 as his best goal this season reach for the sky : @entity248 's goals could still help fire @entity9 to his dream of winning the @entity48 there are more goals to be scored and while @entity4 regards the glancing header that salvaged a 3 - 3 draw against @entity244 in november as his favourite so far , the best — and most important — may be yet to come			1
‘ at the beginning of the season the aim for everyone was to get into the @entity261 , ’ says @entity4 , who already has a title medal from his spell with @entity131			1
‘ but as time has gone on and we have done well , now we ’re getting towards the business end and we ’re up there			0
‘ a lot of people ’s perception is that maybe we can win the league			2
there are others in a better position so we just have to take each one as it comes and see where we end up			0
when i came here it was a dream , of course , to be involved in winning titles			0
