by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:11 pm on 11th january 2012 she struck up a friendship with @entity4 and @entity5 by displaying the @entity7 flag , dressing in tank tops and shorts and sending racy photos , according to court records			1
little did the @entity14 know , @entity13 - an attractive woman 20 years their junior - was working as a federal informant			1
four years later , in june 2009 , the white supremacist brothers from @entity17 were charged in a 2004 bombing that injured a black city official in @entity20 , @entity21			1
today , the trial for the twin 61 - year - olds - delayed several times because of the extensive amount of evidence in their case - was underway			1
on trial : @entity30 and @entity31 were arrested in june 2009 after a five - year undercover operation it started in february 26 , 2004			1
a bombing in which a package detonated in the hands of @entity38 , @entity20 's diversity director at the time			1
the package injured @entity38 's hand and arm and hurt a secretary			2
the brothers have pleaded not guilty in the case			1
@entity20 police immediately called the @entity46 for assistance			2
but with limited access to the brothers , @entity13 was put on the case			1
as @entity50 reports , federal court records say little about @entity13 ' background , a civilain with no apparent professional training			2
in a hearing in september 2010 in federal court in @entity57 , she said she was hired ' just to get information			2
' she was placed with an undercover female @entity46 agent in a trailer near the @entity61 at a @entity67 , @entity62 trailer park - littered with cameras and microphones that would eventually capture the @entity14 ' apparent confessions			1
scene : @entity4 and @entity5 were arrested at their home in @entity71 , @entity17 ( pictured ) on the move : the @entity74 brothers were living in @entity75 in the months before the 2004 bombing , but moved to @entity67 , where the @entity77 sent their informant court records say the plan worked , and that the @entity14 came over as @entity13 was displaying a @entity7 flag in front of her trailer			1
documents suggest @entity31 opened up to her , showed her how to make bombs and bragged about bombing a @entity87 , an @entity88 , an immigration facility , and an abortion clinic			2
those claims have not been corroborated			2
he also talked to her about the @entity20 bombing , telling her that he did n't do it but convinced white police officers to do it			2
while discussing the @entity20 bombing , court records indicate that @entity31 said : ' i just wanted to teach ( @entity38 ) a lesson the first time			2
' @entity31 also is accused of making a call to the diversity office in september 2003 and saying , ' the white @entity105 resistance is growing in @entity20			0
there 's a few white people who are standing up			0
' @entity74 's defence attorney , @entity108 , argued that @entity74 ' often makes exaggerated self - aggrandizing claims ' that are n't true , that he was an alcoholic who constantly was drinking @entity111 , and that his statements to @entity13 were just meant to impress her			1
@entity113 : the @entity14 pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the delivery of a package that detonated in the hands of former @entity20 diversity director @entity38 she and the other defence attorneys in the case tried to get some of the charges thrown out based on what they argued was ' outrageous government conduct ' in the case that amounted to entrapment and coercion			0
@entity13 also gave the @entity14 at least two racy photos - one that showed her in a leather jacket , fishnet stockings and a thong that completely exposed her buttocks , along with a note that said , ' thought you 'd love the butt shot			1
' the other showed her in a revealing white bikini top with a grenade hanging between her breasts as @entity13 posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika			0
' this individual represents hate , and that hate is a danger to the community			0
that someone would come to @entity21 and launch an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs , simply because of hate ... is unconscionable			0
' - @entity38 prosecutors pointed out that @entity13 never kissed or had sex with either brother			1
@entity156 agreed with the prosecution in an october 2010 ruling , saying that although @entity31 ' developed a strong physical and emotional attraction to her , ' their relationship did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation that warranted dismissing charges			0
in a letter filed as evidence in federal court , @entity31 wrote that he led the @entity167 from 1987 to 1991 and that brother @entity30 was never a member of the group , only a ' small money supporter			0
' in a 2007 interview with a @entity172 reporter , @entity31 expressed his anti-government views , saying that ' it 's going to take violence ' and praising @entity177 bomber @entity176			0
' they ( the government ) only understand the rich and the powerful , but they also understand @entity176 and guys that know how to be violent in the right way to get the job done , ' he said			0
he also said violence was a way to get the attention of whites , warning that @entity189 were taking over the @entity190 and black people were taking over the @entity192			0
idolised : in a 2007 interview with a @entity172 reporter , @entity31 praised @entity177 bomber @entity176 ( centre ) authorities said they found assault weapons , hundreds of rounds of ammunition and white supremacist material in the @entity14 ' home when they were arrested			1
@entity38 has denied requests to speak about the case but spoke in court during a hearing for @entity5 shortly after his arrest			1
' this individual represents hate , and that hate is a danger to the community , ' @entity38 said as he pointedly looked @entity74 in the eye			0
' that someone would come to @entity21 and launch an attack simply because my skin colour is different from theirs , simply because of hate ... is unconscionable			0
' the @entity14 are charged with conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosive , and @entity31 also is charged with malicious damage of a building by means of explosive and distribution of information related to explosives			1
judge @entity229 ordered the case to proceed today over the objection of defence attorneys who said they needed another week to prepare			0
the @entity14 , dressed in suits , sat quietly as @entity234 stood close by			0
jury selection is expected to take through wednesday			0
