this is the man who allegedly ruined @entity2 for thousands of children after bringing down the @entity5 and @entity6 networks			1
in a brazen television interview , the man , who went by the name ' @entity9 ' said he and a small group launched the @entity2 cyber attack on computer games consoles			1
he claimed that the group he was part of carried out the hack partly for amusement - and to expose poor security			1
december 25 was ruined for children across the country who were forced to abandon plans to spend the holidays in a virtual world playing on their new playstation or @entity5 games systems due to internet hackers			1
children were reduced to tears during the ' worst @entity2 ever ' and parents fumed about paying hundreds of pounds for games consoles that could not be used			2
a notorious group of hackers called @entity37 said it carried out the hack ' for the laughs ' and to expose poor online security			1
now the man known as @entity9 - who is thought to be a member of the group - has given an interview on @entity45 saying a small team had masterminded the attack , adding that he understood ' it 's a bit unethical '			1
speaking from @entity50 , he said : ' this attack was basically done by three people			0
we had a couple of people from outside the group helping with the attacks , helping us a little bit , but most of the traffic was coming from one or two people			0
@entity62 said there had been ' tantrums , tears and everything else ' after attempts to set up the @entity5 console he had bought for his children @entity70 ( pictured ) , 13 , and @entity71 , 11 , kept failing gamers around the world were left disappointed on christmas day after hacking group @entity37 carried through with its threat to bring down both @entity77 's @entity76 and @entity80 's @entity79 service when asked why the group carried out the attack he said : ' mostly to raise awareness - to amuse ourselves			1
' also one of the big aspects here was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies			0
' he added that he would be ' worried ' if children ' did n't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles on @entity98 and @entity2			1
' meanwhile , a @entity100 man was last night named as one of the hackers who carried out the devastating attack			1
@entity105 was said by a rival group to be a member of @entity37			2
last night mr @entity105 , 22 , denied the accusation			0
speaking outside his parents ’ home in @entity111 , @entity112 , he said : ‘ i am not a member of @entity37			2
i am not one of the hackers			0
it is a case of mistaken identity			0
’ however , in messages believed to have been posted by @entity105 , a @entity119 user with the tag @ @entity121 admitted he was the ‘ spokesperson for the group ’ , adding that police knew about cyber attack ‘ and they have all my info if needed ’			0
earlier , mr @entity105 spoke to @entity45 and presented himself as ‘ an independent security analyst ’ , without any suggestion of him being a member of the hacking group			1
@entity37 first announced that it planned to take down the @entity76 and @entity79 on christmas day in early december , describing itself as the ' next generation @entity132 ' however , on @entity133 , an unnamed man with an identical voice who said he had just turned 22 admitted being part of the attack			1

@entity152 said her ten - year - old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an @entity5 for @entity2			1

one of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations			0
this feature , however , requires an internet connection and many children were left disappointed at their inability to use it			0

in an interview on tech website @entity256 , @entity37 said that it had carried out the attack on christmas day to ' anger and reach the largest amount of people '			2
it claimed that the attack was to highlight poor online security and that @entity80 had barely any protection at all for its @entity5 online network			1
