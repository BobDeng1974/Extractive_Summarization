we are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against @entity35			2
' the @entity11 manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked			2
@entity0 and @entity26 were the worst two players on the pitch			2
' how can you tell me that a manager goes and watches @entity35 against @entity24 , the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes , the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full - back for @entity11 and @entity48 does n’t get in the squad ? ' ‘ he said when the squad was announced that i should be “ nowhere near the squad ”			1
it did n’t really annoy me , but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics			2
hopefully i ’ve done that as i always have			0
’ @entity4 had made his comments on @entity53 when @entity54 named the players for games against @entity57 and @entity6			1
the 1 - 1 draw in @entity21 had not long ended when @entity0 ( below ) tweeted to his 285,000 followers : ‘ not bad for a player that should be “ nowhere near the squad ” ay @ @entity63 ? ’ the @entity24 ’s winger ’s father @entity65 joined in , too , tweeting : “ oh ye of little faith # @entity4 get in			1
’ they could also have pointed out that @entity0 ’s screamer was his third for @entity11 , taking him level with @entity4			1
‘ you can never stop proving things to people , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but i think every time i ’ve put on an @entity11 shirt i have done myself justice , i have done @entity54 justice and the nation justice			2
i was a bit disappointed with his comments but i have come on the pitch and silenced them			0
' @entity53 pundit @entity4 ( centre ) criticised @entity0 's call - up to the @entity11 squad last week @entity88 congratulates his @entity24 team - mate @entity0 after the final whistle in @entity21 good - natured north @entity91 @entity7 skirmishing aside , there will have been a few @entity24 supporters who understood @entity4 ’s point			1
@entity0 ’s form has been inconsistent , and having seen him come off the bench to score for @entity11 they will wonder why he can not do it more often for @entity24			1
‘ i ca n’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is , ’ admitted @entity0 , when asked about the contrast			0
‘ the ( @entity11 ) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game			0
‘ i would n’t say it ’s my best form but this is the best form i ’ve produced this season			0
i have had a few injury problems but i ’m over the worst of that			0

it came from his weaker , right foot , against elite opposition and he made a beeline for @entity121 after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir			0
‘ he is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him i thought was no mean feat , ’ said @entity0			0
