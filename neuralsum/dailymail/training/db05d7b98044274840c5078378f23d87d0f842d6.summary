@entity0 continues to baffle astronomers as the @entity3 spacecraft gets closer to being captured into orbit around the dwarf planet			1
the latest images , taken nearly 29,000 miles ( 46,000km ) from @entity0 , reveal that a bright ' alien ' spot that stands out in previous images lies close to yet another bright area			1
while @entity11 has not provided an explanation , scientists suggest these spots may be frozen pools of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflect light			1
this image was taken by the @entity3 spacecraft of dwarf planet @entity0 on february 19 from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles ( 46,000 km )			1
it shows that the brightest spot on @entity0 has a dimmer companion , which apparently lies in the same basin ' right now , all we can say is that the material reflects 40 per cent or more of the light falling on it , ' @entity32 astronomer @entity31 , the principal investigator for the @entity3 , told @entity36			1
' this limit is because of the resolution of the camera at this distance from @entity0			2
if the final answer is that it reflects all the light that falls on it , then the most probable reflector would be ice			0
' he added that there may be a volcano - like origin of the spots , but that @entity11 will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations			0
using its ion propulsion system , @entity3 will enter orbit around @entity0 on march 6			1
when it does , it will become the first human - made probe to visit the ' @entity59 ' planet - and scientists hope it will uncover the secrets behind its mysterious white spot			0
@entity3 observed @entity0 completing one full rotation , which lasted about nine hours			1
the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at @entity0 ' surface : from shallow , flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers this animation , enhanced with a star field and projected onto a sphere , showcases a series of images the @entity3 took on approach to @entity0 on february 4 the dwarf planet has been likened to the death star from the hit film @entity82 as scientists receive better and better views of the dwarf planet over the next 16 months , they hope to gain a deeper understanding of its origin and evolution by studying its surface			1
the intriguing bright spots and other interesting features of this captivating world will come into sharper focus			0
' the brightest spot continues to be too small to resolve with our camera , but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on @entity0 , ' said @entity103 , lead investigator for the framing camera team at the @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107			0
earlier this month , @entity3 returned yet another series of stunning animations of @entity0 as its moves ever closer to the dwarf planet			1
at a resolution of 8.5 miles ( 14km ) per pixel , the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world , which @entity3 is due to arrive at on march 6			1
the set of images - which are stitched together in an animation - were taken on february 4th at a distance of about 90,000 miles ( 145,000 km )			1
' we know so little about our vast solar system , but thanks to economical missions like @entity3 , those mysteries are being solved , ' said @entity127 , @entity128 at @entity11			0
the new @entity3 images come on the heels of initial navigation images taken in january that reveal an ' alien ' white spot on the dwarf planet and the suggestion of craters			1
over the next weeks , @entity3 will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world			2
' we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity0			0
' now , @entity3 is ready to change that , ' said @entity141 , @entity3 's chief engineer and mission director , based at @entity11 's @entity143 in @entity144			0
at 8.5 miles ( 14km ) per pixel , the pictures represent the sharpest images to date of the icy world , which @entity3 is due to arrive at on march 6 the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images the icy world as the @entity3 hurtles its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 on the left is a processed image , taken january 13			1
it hints at craters on the surface of @entity0			2
@entity3 's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles ( 383,000km ) from @entity0			1
on the right , is a zoomed - in raw image @entity0 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			2
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity3 mission director and chief engineer @entity141 , of @entity11 's @entity143 in @entity167 , @entity144 said			0
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity0 has held since the dawn of the solar system			2
' observations by the @entity177 's @entity176 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
@entity0 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity182 and @entity183 and is very similar to @entity183 's @entity184 and @entity186 's @entity185 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
@entity0 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			0
the long exposure made @entity0 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity0 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity3 will be captured into @entity0 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity0 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity0 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			0
scientists think @entity0 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity222 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity11 's @entity3 has been making its way to @entity0 from the asteroid @entity229 since september 2012			2
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity0 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			2
dr @entity240 , of the @entity177 's lab in @entity242 in @entity243 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity0 over its orbit the @entity3 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity0 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity0			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity0 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity222 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity183			1
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity222 and @entity269 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity222			0
@entity0 is twice the size of @entity186 's geyser - spouting moon @entity272 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity222 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity3 has already visited @entity229 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity0			1
the distance between @entity229 and @entity0 is greater than the distance between the @entity222 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity229 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			1
@entity229 and @entity0 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			0
@entity0 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface			0

@entity0 orbits the sun between @entity182 and @entity183 , and may have water gushing from its surface
latest images to reveal the mystery patch were taken by @entity3 at a distance of 29,000 miles ( 46,000 km )
scientists suggest these *strange* spots may be frozen pools of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflect light
@entity3 is currently travelling to meet @entity0 in march where it will *attempt* to understand its geological history
