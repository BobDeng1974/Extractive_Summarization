@entity0 : as with most sites , legitimate warnings from the site will come when you attempt to log in , not in unsolicited emails , no matter how convincing they look ' @entity8 ' scams range from the hilariously inept up to sophisticated attacks that can fool even computer experts			1
but a new email @entity0 scam is among the cleverer attacks directed at users of the social network - now a commercial hub used to trade music , video and films			1
a recent assault designed to steal users ' @entity0 details is among the most sophisticated yet , say experts - because it mimics the security procedures that sites such as @entity0 or @entity27 use to defend against ' internet trolls ' and other ' bad behaviour ' online			1
the scam comes in the form of an email accusing the user of a violation for insulting or annoying another @entity0 users - and saying that their account will be deleted in 24 hours			1
naturally , at this point , the email requires @entity0 login details and - for ' authentication ' purposes - parts of a person 's credit card details			1
the email links to a fake account disabled page , which asks for a large number of personal details , including crediti card details			0
as site @entity53 , which found the email , points out , the access to login details enasbles the scam to travel further and faster , by sending it to new users from trusted friends			2
' the emails are entirely bogus , ' says internet security experts @entity62			0
' they are not coming from @entity0			0
social media venues would not request financial information , nor would they request login details			1
' once a criminal has gained access to a victim â€™s account , they will likely lock out the original account holder by changing account passwords and email addresses			2
with the credit card information , fraudsters can conduct identity theft and other malicious financial activity			0
' @entity0 's recent partnerships with music companies such as @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as games companies such as @entity85 , mean that the site holds a full ' suite ' of data that could be used for identity theft hoax - slayer warned against emails that contain phrases ' last warning : your acccount is considered to violated the policies that are considered annoying or insulting to @entity0 users			1
' the fishy smell becomes even stronger at this point - users are asked to ' confirm to their webmail ' about the security breach			0
a third page , with a fake ' terms and conditions ' harvests yet more data , along with a series of stern warnings			0
by this time , expereienced internet users would probably realise that the email was not legitimate - but @entity0 's wide user base among the young , the old and people in developing countries mean that not everybody might be familiar with such internet scams			1
a similar recent @entity0 scam purporting to be from @entity116 claimed to be watching out for users ' accounts being accessed from elsewhere - using almost exactly the same vocabulary @entity27 and @entity0 use when you do log in from an unfamiliar location			1
@entity122 reported the email as saying , ' your @entity0 account was recently logged into from a computer , mobile device or other location you 've never used before			2
# we have reviewed your account activity , and we get information about possible unauthorized access to your @entity0			2
we have provided a warning to you via email ' sites such as @entity0 and @entity27 do issue warnings about rule violations and unaauthorised access , of course , but usually only when people are attempting to log in to the sites			2
any warning of this sort received by email should be treated with extreme caution			0
@entity62 says , ' these phishing scams boil down to a naked grab for your account details			0
remember , neither @entity0 nor other reputable social media sites would ask for this information			0
the mere request is a surefire way to suss out @entity157 bogosity beacon : note the grammatical and spelling errors			0
