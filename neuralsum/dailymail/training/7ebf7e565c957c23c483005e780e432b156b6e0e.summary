@entity0 no @entity2 fly - half keeps defenders guessing quite like @entity0			1
be it a deft chip over the defence or an audacious dummy , he has the guts to try things that others wo n’t			0
his defence was called into question as a youngster , but a grounding experience with @entity16 has improved that area of his game			0
if @entity19 is looking to add spark with a second - half replacement , then @entity0 ticks all the boxes			2
strength : attacking spark weakness : goal - kicking @entity0 will provide @entity19 's side with plenty of attacking spark @entity28 @entity29 is beginning to deliver on the potential that saw him named @entity32 in 2011			1
alongside @entity0 , the 21 - year - old is @entity35 ’s second most attack - minded option , but is much more consistent			2
his spatial awareness and willingness to run at defenders creates chances			0
kicking from hand is world class			0
strengths : goal - kicking , vision weakness : inexperienced @entity28 is a strong goal - kicker , but the 21 - year - old lacks experience at the top level @entity49 the @entity51 youngster is very good at managing the game from outside - half , but he does not have attacking instincts of @entity29 and @entity0			1
if @entity35 are planning to stick to rigid patterns and set - plays @entity49 is an effective middle - man , who also brings a good goal - kicking rate when under pressure			1
club form has been hit by injuries and @entity62 ’s form			0
strengths : composure , defensive management weakness : lack of spark @entity49 kicks at goal against @entity67 in @entity68 during @entity35 's tour in june 2014 @entity70 mr @entity71 for top - of - the - table @entity72 , @entity70 brings a cool head as he pulls the strings			1
but despite his continual inclusion in the @entity35 set - up , @entity70 has made little impact on match - day squads			1
not a player who scares the likes of @entity67 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
strength : experienced weakness : conservative @entity70 's form has helped @entity72 top of the @entity88 table , but he can be conservative			2

@entity19 names four fly - halves in his @entity93 *training* squad
@entity0 is handed a *surprise* *recall* to the @entity35 set - up
