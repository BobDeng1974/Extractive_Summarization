@entity1 legend @entity0 warned the @entity3 board they missed a trick by throwing out @entity7 financier @entity6 ’s £ 20million takeover bid for the crisis club			1
earlier this month , @entity1 directors rejected the @entity13 owner ’s attempt to purchase a controlling stake - arguing he was unlikely to receive the necessary backing of 75 per cent of shareholders			1
but @entity13 - based @entity0 , who suggested to the businessman that he buy @entity1 after coaching one of his children at football , criticised the board for not acting in the club ’s best interests			1
@entity0 feels @entity1 have missed out by rejecting @entity6 's bid for the club @entity6 is the owner of @entity24 side @entity13 and tried to buy @entity1 when asked if it was a missed opportunity , the 46 - year - old said : ‘ it is			1
i do n’t know if i ’m speaking out of turn but i know it ’s a fantastic opportunity , and i ’m sure there could have been ways to make it work			2
the shareholding piece of it did n’t work out but if those guys really had @entity1 at heart they would have tried to find a way to make it work			1
‘ i do n’t know if people want power or whatever , but the way i think the shareholdings are , there ’s a lot of small shareholdings that all add up			2
it ’s a difficult situation			0
he needed 75 per cent and they felt they could n’t have got that			0
the shareholders really could have made it happen			0
’ @entity6 had proposed to loan @entity1 £ 6.5m up front after seeing his initial offer rejected on january 6 , only for his second proposal to be blocked on january 12			1
but @entity0 , who won six league titles under @entity55 during the nine - in - a - row era , believes @entity6 would have turned @entity1 into a force again			1
‘ he ’s such an honest guy , whatever he says you can take as gospel , ’ added @entity0 , speaking at the @entity60 ’s @entity59 course at @entity61			1
‘ he had visions of getting @entity1 back to where they were and even further			1
he ’s obviously disappointed but he feels he ’s the guy who could turn the place around			0
’ @entity0 is unsure if the basketball franchise owner will launch another bid			1
asked if @entity6 could join forces with @entity70 or the @entity71 , he said : ‘ i do n’t know			1
he was prepared to invest a lot in it			2
i talk to him now and again			0
he ’s never going to give too much away			0
he ’s obviously very interested but he ’s got banks to look after , the @entity13 and the @entity76			1
he was very , very serious about @entity1			1
rangers are in financial difficulties and the future of the club is uncertain ‘ he is by the book and straight talking			0
he ’s not going to go around doing anything dodgy behind the scenes			0
i know him better than most			0
when somebody like him knocks on your door , i find it hard to understand why they did n’t open it			0
‘ he was prepared to invest a lot			2
on and off the field he could have done so much			0
i know @entity1 as a club - even on the business side of it - are not operating to full capacity			1
whoever ends up in control , you just hope there ’s a good , solid plan			0
’ after @entity103 and @entity104 , it ’s perhaps understandable @entity1 were wary of a foreign investor appearing from nowhere			1
but @entity0 argued it would n’t have been difficult to establish @entity6 ’s credibility			1
‘ with technology these days , it does n’t take long to work out what a good guy he is			0
my daughter goes to school in @entity115 - the @entity116 - and he ’s got the @entity117 there , so he does a lot of good , a lot of charity work			0
the @entity13 do a lot of charity stuff			1
‘ i run a club in @entity13 and his kids play within the club , i coach one of them			1
he ’s just like any other parent , stands on the sidelines and cheers his kids on			0
he ’s a down - to - earth guy and has been very generous to our club			0
’ @entity132 has been linked with a takeover but his ties with @entity135 could complicate matters @entity6 the basketball chief has an impressive record with the @entity13 , winning three successive @entity24 titles between 2005 and 2007			1
‘ he ’s just a winner , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ he ’s obviously got the wealth to invest in a club - at some point he will - but he ’s also got the infrastructure			2
you ’ve got to meet tough guidelines with the franchise every year , every week			0
‘ before i started talking to him , he was looking at other clubs in @entity149 and @entity150			0
i mentioned @entity1 and the problems they are in , and , having been there and seen what ’s happened , he ’s the type they need			2
he loves the passion that the club and the supporters have			0
he ’s had loads of messages , thank yous — he ’ll definitely remember @entity1 for a long time			2
