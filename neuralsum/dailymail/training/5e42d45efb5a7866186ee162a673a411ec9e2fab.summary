@entity0 may have been deliberately flown off course by someone in the cockpit , a new documentary claims			1
aviation disaster experts have analysed satellite data from the lost @entity7 flight and discovered that the plane flew on for hours after losing contact			1
careful examination of the evidence has revealed that @entity0 made three turns after the last radio call , first a turn to the left , then two more , taking the plane west , then south towards @entity16			1
' this accident has caught the attention of the world in a way i have not seen in a forty - year career in aviation , ' mr @entity22 says			0
the claims are being made in a new @entity36 documentary out next month where mr @entity22 and a team of experts try to solve the mystery of @entity0			2
this follows confident claims by the @entity43 co-ordinator of the search that the doomed jetliner will be found within the next few months			1
evidence : according to @entity22 , a world 's leading expert in the causes of aviation disasters , those turns ' strongly suggest ' someone in the cockpit deliberately flew @entity0 off course tracking it down : @entity54 commissioner @entity53 said he was sure his team would unearth the wreckage by then as the current search for the @entity7 plane is set to wrap up by the end of may , @entity54 commissioner @entity53 said he was hopeful his team would unearth the wreckage by then , @entity57 reported			1
but the @entity61 is remaining tight lipped about the issue , saying the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity43 governments would be assessing what to do next			1
@entity0 vanished on march 8 , 2014 while travelling from @entity68 to @entity69 with 239 people on board			1
no trace of the jet has been recovered since then but mr @entity53 believes his team are close to discovering the wreckage			0
' i do n't wake up every day thinking ' this will be the day ' but i do wake up every day hoping this will be it , and expecting that sometime between now and may that will be the day , ' commissioner @entity53 told @entity80 ' it 's been both baffling and from our point of view unprecedented - not only the mystery of it , but also on the scale of what we 're doing to find the aircraft			0
' as we keep on pointing out , we do n't have a certainty only a confidence that we 'll find the missing aircraft			0
' the search for @entity0 has so far been fruitless , with the crash site initially thought to be in the @entity95 or @entity96 of @entity97			2
accident : relatives of passengers of @entity0 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the @entity66 government had announced recently that the fate of @entity0 was an accident but search efforts were then redirected to the southern part of the @entity108			1
this late start meant any trace of the wreckage on the surface of the ocean floor would have sunk and it is thought some of the debris would have appeared on the shores of @entity117 in @entity118			0
so far , they have been unsuccessful in tracking down any piece of the aircraft but experts were trying to predict its floating patterns to locate the wreckage site by considering ' how the aircraft would 've collided with the water '			0
the @entity61 , which , headed by @entity43 , is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed , equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area			2
it is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels , equipment or from the weather , the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in may			0
the ' go @entity140 ' supply ship has remained in the area , 2,500km to the south west of @entity143 , western @entity43 , but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in @entity43 for scheduled visits			2
despite months of searching in the area , there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far .			0
