row after row of terraced @entity108 houses in @entity109 , a predominantly @entity110 area of west @entity9 , had outhouses and garages transformed into makeshift bedsits barely big enough to lie down in			1
in some , bare electric wires trailed dangerously from extension cables alongside rubber piping carrying cold water from the main house			0
