the early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other , less serious conditions			0
they include : persistent indigestion and heartburn , trapped wind and frequent burping , feeling very full or bloated after meals , persistent stomach pain as the disease develops , more advanced symptoms include : blood in your stools , or black stools loss of appetite weight loss in many cases , due to the face the early symptoms are so similar to other conditions , the disease is often advanced by the time it is detected			2

' it did n't fully click			0
i was scared and really nervous , ' @entity6 told @entity90			2
the news was even more devastating as only two years earlier her father has died from cancer			1
' i know the toll it puts on you , ' @entity6 said			2
she underwent a second during which the tumor itself and further cells were scrapped			0
the tumor was reviewed and @entity6 was told the cancer had been caught at an early state and it had not spread through the muscle wall			1
@entity6 did not need any chemotherapy or radiation and is now cancer - free			1
she has dropped her 10 dress sizes and weighs about 288lbs , and has more energy than before			1
@entity6 has had to adjust her diet following the operation as gastric bypass is a major surgical procedure , which changes eating and dietary habits dramatically			2
after surgery , the patients can no longer hold large quantities of food , but need to eat smaller amounts at regular intervals			0
the patients also need to eat in a different way as foods rich in fat , sugar and fibre may cause discomfort in the smaller stomach			0
' if i 'd not gone through with the [ weight loss ] surgery when i did , things would be 100 percent different , ' she said to the @entity132 ' my cancer would have probably spread and it would have been too late to have had anything done about it			2
