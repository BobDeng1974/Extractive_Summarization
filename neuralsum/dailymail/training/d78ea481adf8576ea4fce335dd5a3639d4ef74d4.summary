by @entity0 last updated at 1:17 pm on 13th january 2012 a mother has spoken of her hurt and outrage after she found out the brain of her six - week - old baby had been kept in a jar at @entity7 for 13 years			1
@entity8 , 40 , buried her son @entity9 in 1999 but has now been told that doctors removed his brain during a post-mortem at the medical centre			1
she said although she knew tissues had been removed to ascertain the cause of death - which was found to be cot death - she had no idea the entire organ had been removed			1
@entity9 's brain was found in a jar at @entity7 the organ was held in storage until it was discovered during a national audit into remains kept by police			1
similar cases of organs being kept without the knowledge of their loved ones are likely to emerge as the audit continues			0
it could trigger another organ ' harvesting ' scandal like the one at @entity35 in 1999			0
the mother - of - four , who lives in @entity37 , said she felt that the authorities had ' stolen ' a piece of her baby			2
she told the @entity41 : ' i feel hurt and let down by people i thought i could trust at the worst time in my life			2
i trusted them with my son 's body and they returned it to me incomplete			0
' a spokesman for @entity7 said @entity9 had not been a patient there and they had been asked to keep the organ at the request of the @entity56 and @entity58 police as part of a forensic case for the coroner			1
' we are asked to hold these specimens at the request of the police / coroner until told what they want us to do , ' he said			2
the brain will now be buried alongside @entity9 's body although ms @entity8 and her former husband @entity70 said they would be too upset to attend			1
' it will be too painful , ' ms @entity8 told the @entity41			0
' i thought i had said good - bye to @entity9 all those years ago			1
i ca n't go through it again			0
' their other choices were to allow the brain to be kept for medical research or have the hospital ' dispose ' of it			0
but ms @entity8 said : ' i was n't going to let them keep it			0
' @entity83 released a statement saying : ' we are very aware of the sensitivities of the families affected and are working closely with hospitals , pathologists and coroner 's departments to complete the audit and inform families as quickly as possible			2
' we know this is incredibly difficult for the family and friends of those people whose tissue we have identified and we are providing all the support we can to help them			0
