a new book out in @entity1 reveals how president @entity2 was a secret admirer of the @entity4			1
the news comes embarrassingly close to a visit being paid to @entity7 next month by president @entity8 - one week before 50th anniversary commemorations of @entity12 's memorable ' ich bin ein @entity14 ' speech pledging @entity16 solidarity with @entity17 during the @entity18			1
president @entity2 's travelogues and letters chronicling his wanderings through @entity1 before @entity22 , when @entity23 was in power , have been unearthed and show him generally in favour of the movement that was to plunge the world into the greatest war in history secret : a new book out in @entity1 reveals how president @entity2 was a secret admirer of the @entity4 ' fascism ? ' wrote the youthful president - to - be in one			1
' the right thing for @entity1			0
' in another ; ' what are the evils of fascism compared to communism ? ' and on august 21 , 1937 - two years before the war that would claim 50 million lives broke out - he wrote : ' the @entity43 really are too good - therefore people have ganged up on them to protect themselves			0
' and in a line which seems directly plugged into the racial superiority line plugged by the @entity1 he wrote after travelling through the @entity48 : ' the @entity50 races certainly seem to be superior to the @entity51			0
' the future president 's praise is now embarrassing in hindsight - a few years later he fought in @entity55 against the @entity4 and his elder brother lt. @entity2 , @entity52 was killed			1
revealing : presidential diaries and photographs are among more than 500 items from a collection of @entity12 documents and artifacts tour : @entity2 recovers , right , from jaundice in a @entity66 hospital in 1937 and left juggles on a street in @entity68 during a trip to @entity17 trip : @entity2 and one of his sisters ride camels in @entity74 in 1939 as a young man , the future president had desperately wanted to go into the @entity77 but was originally rejected - mainly due to a back injury he sustained playing football while attending @entity80			1
in 1941 , though , his politically connected father @entity81 used his influence to get him in to the service and he joined the @entity77			0
in 1942 , @entity2 volunteered for @entity85 ( motorized torpedo ) boat duty in the @entity87			2
on 12 june 1944 he received the @entity77 's highest honor for gallantry for his heroic actions as a gunboat pilot during @entity22 the @entity92 and the @entity93 were presented to lt. @entity2 for his heroics and injuries sustained in the rescue of the crew of @entity85 during on august 2 , 1943 when the motor torpedo boat was struck by a @entity101 destroyer			1
his back was hurt during duty and @entity2 was released from all active duty and finally retired from the @entity105 on physical disability in march 1945			2
' i can imagine no more rewarding a career			0
and any man who may be asked in this century what he did to make his life worthwhile , i think can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction : i served in the @entity77			0
' @entity12 source : @entity116 other musings concern how great the autobahns were - ' the best roads in the world ' - and how , having visited @entity23 's @entity122 holiday home in @entity123 and the tea house built on top of the mountain for him			1
he declared ; ' who has visited these two places can easily imagine how @entity23 will emerge from the hatred currently surrounding him to emerge in a few years as one of the most important personalities that ever lived			0
' @entity2 's admiration for @entity1 is revealed in a book entitled ' @entity12 - among the @entity43			1
travel diaries and letters 1937 - 1945			0
' when @entity22 did arrive , the future president 's father , @entity81 , strongly opposed going into battle with @entity1 and made several missteps that severely damaged his political career			2
he adopted a defeatist , anti-war stance and tried to arrange a meeting with @entity23 without the approval of the @entity146			0
the reasons for this are unclear - some speculate he was eager to do anything to avoid war because he feared that @entity16 capitalism - which he profited from - would not survive the country â€™s entry into the conflict			2
in his role as @entity16 ambassador to @entity158 he also opposed providing the @entity159 with military and economic aid			2
he said in an interview ' democracy is finished in @entity163			0
it may be here [ in the @entity16 ]			2
during the @entity22 , @entity12 's older brother @entity166 volunteered for a secret mission testing an experimental drone plane packed with explosives - a weapon the @entity171 hoped to use as a guided missile			1
on the first test flight , the explosives detonated prematurely and the plane exploded - his body was never found			0
studies : the future @entity16 president sits at a typewriter , holding open his published thesis , ' @entity181 ' march 1939 , @entity66 , @entity12 and his father , @entity182 , @entity16 ambassador to @entity158 , board an @entity184 plane at @entity185			1
he accompanied his father to @entity187 , where he will be representing president @entity188 at the coronation of pope @entity190 pals : @entity2 and @entity192 , right , who was a classmate from the @entity193 and @entity194 , outside a drugstore in the mid 1930s travel companion : @entity2 , @entity198 the dog , and @entity192 at the @entity200 , during their @entity17 trip the youthful president carved his own place in history when he stood outside the @entity7 town hall of @entity207 on june 26 1963 to declare @entity16 solidarity with the city and the continent with the immortal words ; ' @entity212			1
' the fact that , strictly speaking , he was referring to himself as a doughnut - a @entity14 - did not diminish the wild enthusiasm for him			2
but his praise of @entity23 in a country still struggling to come to terms with his legacy may prove awkward for @entity8 who will visit @entity7 for wide - ranging talks with chancellor @entity222 on june 18 and 19			1
@entity16 president @entity12 at the @entity223 during his visit to @entity1			1
the youthful president carved his own place in history when he stood outside the @entity7 town hall on june 26 1963 to declare @entity16 solidarity with the city and the continent with the immortal words ; ' @entity212 ' infamous : one of president @entity2 's speech cards carrying his famous remark ' ich bin ein @entity234 ' , which he delivered in a speech that electrified an adoring crowd in @entity7 fans : thousands of citizens lined the main street in @entity7 as the president arrived flanked by police and bodyguards farewell : president @entity12 waves goodbye as he leaves @entity7 for @entity245 but his praise was not entirely without caveats			1
' it is evident that the @entity43 were scary for him , ' said @entity250 magazine in @entity7			2
in the diaries of the three trips he made to prewar @entity1 he also recognised ; ' @entity23 seems to be as popular here as @entity254 in @entity1 , although propaganda is probably his most powerful weapon			0
' observers say his writings ranged between aversion and attraction for @entity1			0
the book also contains his impressions when walking through a shattered @entity7 after the war : ' an overwhelming stench of bodies - sweet and nauseating '			1
and of the recently deceased @entity266 he said ; ' his boundless ambition for his country made him a threat to peace in the world , but he had something mysterious about him			0
he was the stuff of legends			0
' the book editor 's believe that he was ' eerily fascinated ' by fascism			0
