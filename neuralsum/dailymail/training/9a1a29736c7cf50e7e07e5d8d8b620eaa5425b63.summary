by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 6 november 2013 @entity2 picture : dr @entity3 took a picture of a woman 's ' unusual ' genitals to add to his collection a cosmetic surgeon who took a photograph of a woman 's ' unusual ' genitals on his iphone while she was on the operating table is facing a ban from the profession			1
dr @entity3 , 53 , was about to replace the anaesthetised woman 's breast implants when he apparently noticed an unusual feature to her genitalia			1
the father - of - two pointed out what he had seen to a nurse and said : ' look at hers , she 's not complaining			2
' @entity3 then pulled the patient 's surgical pants to the side with one hand while taking a picture on his iphone			1
the surgeon , who is a specialist in female genital cosmetic surgery , told the @entity32 he ' only took one photograph			2
' @entity3 , who has a ' super specialist ' interest in women 's vaginas planned to put the picture in his portfolio of genitalia to show other patients as a comparison			1
dr @entity3 was suspended from the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 after the matron ' dragged him like a naughty schoolboy ' to apologise to the woman and her husband			1
the @entity52 medic said he had taken the photograph because there was an unusual amount of skin around the woman 's clitoral hood			1
but the panel , chaired by dr @entity60 , today found him guilty of serious misconduct and he now faces a possible ban from the profession			1
' the panel has no doubt that the public at large would be appalled at what you have done			0
the medical profession has self - evidently been brought into disrepute , ' said dr @entity60			2
' the panel accepts that your conduct constitutes a single act but considers it to be serious			0
' it involved a deliberate act in which you pulled aside @entity77 's surgical underpants in order to photograph the exposed area			2
' the panel considers it inconceivable that , as an experienced doctor , who undertook this form of surgery on a regular basis and had frequent experience of both consent and photography , you did not recognise the significance of your actions			0
' furthermore , on your own evidence , you took a willful decision to take the photograph even when questioned by a colleague			0
' the woman underwent the operation to have her @entity98 breast implants removed at the private hospital run by @entity100 on february 27 last year			1
she gave her consent for the surgeon to capture before and after photographs of her breasts and was taken into the theatre where she was anaesthetised			2
incident : dr @entity3 was about to replace a woman 's breast implants at the private @entity44 ( pictured ) in @entity45 , @entity46 , when he took the photo without her consent , the tribunal heard when nurse @entity113 questioned the doctor about the image he told her it was fine as the patient could not be identified from the picture			1
' i was surprised she was exposed in that area			0
i could not quite believe it had happened and it stunned me , ' miss @entity113 said in a statement			2
the tribunal heard the patient 's husband was so furious he wanted to punch @entity3			1
in her statement the patient describes the matron ' dragging dr @entity3 behind her ' and says ' he was very embarrassed about having been dragged in like a naughty schoolboy			1
' she added : ' i feel i have lost my trust in the profession			0
' i have an unrelated operation coming up and i 'm just really nervous about it wondering what might happen			0
' ' it was wrong			0
i took a photograph without her consent			0
i got carried away by my super specialist interest and i 'm fully aware that was wrong ' dr @entity3 just days after the operation , on march 5 , dr @entity3 made a phone call to a ' stunned ' patient to tell her he had been suspended			1
on the same day she received a letter from his solicitor apologising ' unreservedly ' and stating he had taken the photo to put in a portfolio of women 's genitalia to show to other patients			1
it read : ' i am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and i was hoping , with your consent , to do so with yours			2
' i would have discussed this with you and , of course , had you objected , i would have disposed of the imagery immediately			0
' dr @entity3 was temporarily suspended by the @entity165 in april 2012 ahead of today 's hearing			1
however , he was allowed to return to work under supervision following a @entity170 ruling in january			0
he now faces a full ban from the profession after being found guilty of misconduct			1
giving evidence , dr @entity3 said the case has had a ' catastrophic ' impact on his life and he is now bankrupt , has had his @entity178 repossessed and has been forced to sell his three - storey @entity180 home			1
i took a photograph without her consent			0
i got carried away by my super specialist interest and i 'm fully aware that was wrong , ' he said			0
' it was a devastating episode in my life and perhaps also in the patient 's life and i 'm therefore grateful the @entity165 have not asked the patient to appear here as a witness because that would have been devastating for her			0
' she has expressed the feeling she did n't want my career to be ruined over this			0
' despite apologising and showing remorse , the panel decided he had not shown full insight into his actions and ruled his fitness to work was impaired			0
dr @entity60 said : ' notwithstanding that this was an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished career of a gifted and valued practitioner , the panel has concluded that as at today 's date your fitness to practise remains impaired			2
' the hearing continues .			0
