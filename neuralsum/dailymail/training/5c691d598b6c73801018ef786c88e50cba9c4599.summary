by @entity0 the federal government wants to ban sales of electronic cigarettes to minors and require approval for new products and health warning labels under regulations being proposed by the @entity9			1
while the proposal being issued thursday wo n't immediately mean changes for the popular devices , the move is aimed at eventually taming the fast - growing e-cigarette industry			1
the agency said the proposal sets a foundation for regulating the products but the rules do n't immediately ban the wide array of flavors of e-cigarettes , curb marketing on places like tv or set product standards			1
file - in this feb. 20 , 2014 photo , @entity27 , co-founder of the @entity28 , uses her vaping device in @entity32			1
soon , the @entity9 will propose rules for e-cigarettes			1
the rules will have big implications for a fast - growing industry and its legions of customers			1
( @entity0 photo / @entity40 , file ) any further rules ' will have to be grounded in our growing body of knowledge and understanding about the use of e-cigarettes and their potential health risks or public health benefits , ' commissioner dr. @entity41 said			1
once finalized , the agency could propose more restrictions on e-cigarettes			0
officials did n't provide a timetable for that action			2
members of @entity57 and public health groups have raised concerns over e-cigarettes and questioned their marketing tactics			2
' when finalized ( the proposal ) would result in significant public health benefits , including through reducing sales to youth , helping to correct consumer misperceptions , preventing misleading health claims and preventing new products from entering the market without scientific review by @entity9 , ' said @entity70 , the director of the @entity9 's @entity71			1
the @entity9 said the public , members of the industry and others will have 75 days to comment on the proposal			1
the agency will evaluate those comments before issuing a final rule but there 's no timetable for when that will happen			0
the regulations will be a step in a long process that many believe will ultimately end up being challenged in court			0
smokers have been drawn to e-cigs because they give the impression that smoke is being inhaled but without the thousands of chemicals in cigarettes e-cigarettes are plastic or metal tubes , usually the size of a cigarette , that heat a liquid nicotine solution instead of burning tobacco			2
that creates vapor that users inhale			0
smokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine - infused vapor looks like smoke but does n't contain the thousands of chemicals , tar or odor of regular cigarettes			2
some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco , or to cut down			0
however , there 's not much scientific evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers quit or smoke less , and it 's unclear how safe they are			0
the industry started on the @entity118 and at shopping - mall kiosks and has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide who can choose from more than 200 brands			2
sales are estimated to have reached nearly $ 2 billion in 2013			0
tobacco company executives have noted that they are eating into traditional cigarette sales , and their companies have jumped into the business			0
safe ? the health risk of e-cigs is unknown - some believe they are healthy while others say more research needs to be done to figure out the health effects some believe lightly regulating electronic cigarettes might actually be better for public health overall , if smokers switch and e-cigarettes really are safer			1
others are raising alarms about the hazards of the products and a litany of questions about whether e-cigarettes will keep smokers addicted or encourage others to start using e-cigarettes , and even eventually tobacco products			0
' right now for something like e-cigarettes , there are far more questions than answers , ' @entity70 said , adding that the agency is conducting research to better understand the safety of the devices and who is using them			0
in addition to prohibiting sales to minors and requiring health labels that warn users that nicotine is an addictive chemical , e-cigarette makers also would be required to register their products with the agency and disclose ingredients			1
they also would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products			0
regulations : the new rules would regulate e-cigs similar to how the government regulates regular cigarettes they also could n't use words such as ' light ' or ' mild ' to describe their products , give out free samples or sell their products in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults , such as a bar			2
companies also will be required to submit applications for premarket review within two years			0
as long as an e-cigarette maker has submitted the application , the @entity9 said it will allow the products to stay on the market while they are being reviewed			1
that would mean companies would have to submit an application for all e-cigarettes now being sold .			0

the @entity9 wants to ban the sale of e-cigs to minors
health officials want to curb advertising of e-cigs on television
officials admit little is known about the health risks - or benefits - of e-cigs
