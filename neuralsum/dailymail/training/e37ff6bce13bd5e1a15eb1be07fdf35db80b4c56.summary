the @entity4 have played at @entity7 twice , losing 2 - 0 in both games , in 1994 and 2008 , but @entity0 has helped the nation fall in love with the sport and his team ’s impressive @entity13 performance has fuelled the interest			1

‘ the respect is growing on a global stage for the @entity24			2
