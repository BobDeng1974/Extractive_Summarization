health officials can now add @entity1 to the list of states affected by a surge in measles cases -- a list that now includes 122 patients in 18 states and the @entity8			1
authorities in @entity1 announced monday that an infant brought into @entity11 from outside the @entity12 has tested positive for the highly contagious and potentially dangerous virus			1
this suggests the child may not be among over 100 cases and counting that have been traced back to an outbreak that originated from @entity18 in early january			1
plus @entity1 : the @entity19 will need to update its list of states affected by the current surge in measles cases after @entity1 health officials announced monday an infant in @entity11 has tested positive for the virus the @entity1 baby is being treated at @entity28 of @entity11 according to a @entity1 @entity30 statement obtained by the @entity31			1
it was unclear from the department 's statement from where the child had traveled			2
all but 18 of the cases are tied to an outbreak that started at the @entity18 amusement park in @entity39			1
until recently , it was unusual to see more than 100 cases a year in the @entity12			1
a fact many have linked to the anti-vaccination movement			1
uptick : the @entity1 case puts the number of a cases so far this year at 122 -- a number that puts 2015 on par to easily surpass the 644 cases reported last year most of this year 's measles cases have been traced back to an early january outbreak at @entity18 in @entity39			1
the @entity1 infant came into @entity11 from outside the @entity12 , making it unlikely the child is among the over 100 who 've thus far become infected following a trip to the theme park according to the @entity19 , the @entity12 experienced 23 measles outbreaks in 2014			1
one of these outbreaks saw 383 infections total , most of them among unvaccinated @entity66 populations in @entity67			2
measles are most commonly seen in winter and early spring , brought in by foreign visitors or by @entity12 residents who pick up the highly contagious virus overseas			1
last week , the @entity19 announced 102 total cases in the @entity12 so far this year			1
with an increase of 20 in just a week , 2015 is on par to easily surpass last year 's total of 644 cases , notes the @entity76			1
@entity77 has become relatively rare in the @entity12 , thanks to very effective vaccine			1
a recent outbreak tied to @entity18 has shown that even among some doctors , knowledge of the once - common illness is spotty			1
some questions and answers about a still - dangerous disease that 's re-emerged as a leading public health concern : measles : an electron microscope image of a measles virus particle q : how dangerous is measles ? a : for most people , measles is miserable but not life - threatening			1
the most common symptoms include fever , runny nose , cough , and a rash all over the body			2
however , a very small fraction of people get much sicker , and can suffer complications like pneumonia and encephalitis			2
before there was a vaccine , about 450 to 500 @entity12 died from measles each year , on average			1
also , measles can cause pregnant women to have premature , fragile babies			2
q : how is measles spread ? a : @entity77 is considered one of the most infectious diseases known			2
the virus is spread through the air when someone infected coughs or sneezes			2
it can live up to two hours in the air or on the surfaces of a room afterward			2
it 's so contagious that 90 percent of people who are n't immunized are infected if exposed to the virus , according to the @entity19			1
q : how well does the vaccine work ? a : health officials say the vaccine is 97 percent effective ; people who are vaccinated can still get the measles , although it 's usually a mild case			2
the vaccine was licensed in the @entity12 in 1963 , and as more children were vaccinated , cases plummeted			1
about a decade ago , the nation was down to fewer than 100 cases a year			1
in 2000 , measles was declared eliminated - no longer constantly spreading in the country			2
q : who should be vaccinated ? a : the government recommends that all children get measles vaccine with the first dose when they are about 1 and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6			0
the @entity19 guidance is based on advice from a panel of experts that decides which vaccines are needed and when			0
following that guidance , states have made vaccination a requirement for attending school			0
q : are there any side effects ? a : most people have no reaction			0
some experience temporary pain or swelling where the needle went in			0
about 5 to 10 percent of those who get the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine experience a low - grade fever and a mild rash , according to the @entity19			0
recommended : a doctor in @entity172 administers the measles vaccine to a four - year - old girl			0
parents have been reluctant to vaccinate their children due to suggestions of a link between vaccinations and autism q : do most parents get their kids vaccinated ? a : yes , and the rates have been fairly stable			0
overall , 95 percent of children entering kindergarten are vaccinated			0
but in a number of states , a rising number of parents have filed for exemptions to vaccination requirements			0
some are for medical reasons , but many are for religious or philosophical reasons			0
some of those involve doubts that the vaccine is necessary			0
others fear that the vaccine can cause autism - a concern sparked by a study published in a @entity206 medical journal in 1998			0
that paper was later retracted and thoroughly discredited			0
other studies have found no link			0
the new outbreak has spurred a backlash against vaccination holdouts			2
q : so if measles was eliminated in the @entity12 , why are we seeing cases now ? a : measles is still a big problem in some other parts of the world , and travelers infected abroad can bring the virus into the country and spread it			1
that 's what @entity39 health officials think happened at @entity18 amusement park , although they have n't found the person who triggered the outbreak			1
the last several years have seen more and more of that			0
last year , 644 measles infections were reported in 27 states , the most since 1994			0
more than half of the cases were in an @entity66 community in @entity67 ; missionaries brought measles back from the @entity238			1
q : i 'm an adult			0
do i need a shot ? a : most likely not			0
anyone born before 1957 is thought to be immune because measles was so widespread , and most kids got it			0
adults who got the vaccine as kids are ok , too - they are protected for life			0
however , there was a less - effective vaccine from 1963 to 1967			0
anyone who got that vaccine or those who are n't sure they were ever vaccinated can get the shots now			0

an infant who entered @entity11 from outside the @entity12 was **confirmed** to have the highly contagious virus on monday
@entity39 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity8 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 also have **confirmed** cases
all but fewer than 20 of the cases have been linked back to an outbreak that began at the @entity39 theme park that began sometime around january 7
