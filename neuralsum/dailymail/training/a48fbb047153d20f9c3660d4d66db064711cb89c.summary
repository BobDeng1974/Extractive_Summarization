by @entity0 for @entity1 it was one of the most iconic images of last season ’s thrilling title race , @entity3 captain @entity2 huddled with his players on the @entity10 turf imploring them not to falter in the wake of their 3 - 2 victory over @entity14 that appeared to have nudged momentum their way			1
in the mind of @entity20 , though , it was the work simultaneously being done in the losers ’ dressing room that day that ultimately made the difference			1
from the desolation and pain of what city manager @entity20 has always maintained was an unjust defeat grew the resolution to produce a five - match winning sequence that snatched @entity14 ’s second title in three years			1
despair : @entity14 succumbed to a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity10 last season but eventually won the title elation : @entity39 netted the winner for @entity3 against @entity14 at @entity10 in april reflection : @entity14 manager @entity20 insists defeat at @entity10 inspired their title victory ‘ the turning point was when we lost that game against them at @entity10 , ’ said @entity20 ahead of monday ’s meeting between the teams at the @entity47			1
‘ we were convinced we had to win the last five games to win the title and we knew we could do it			1
‘ we were absolutely convinced we could do it because we felt when we lost against @entity3 that we played better than @entity3 in that game			1
‘ it was a special day for @entity3 and there were a lot of mistakes by the referee also , but we never complained about that			1
‘ we never opened our mouths or said anything about the referees			0
we were sure that if we were able to win the last five games we would do it			2
‘ of course it acted as motivation because when you finish that game , if you feel the other team is better than you , maybe they deserved to be the champions			0
celebration : @entity3 manager @entity74 was overjoyed as his side beat @entity14 in april frustration : @entity20 was not happy with the refereeing decisions during the game at @entity10 ‘ but all of us finished that game thinking we were unlucky to lose			1
’ @entity3 ’s @entity2 , of course , was to have his own moment of ignimony further down the stretch			2
a slip against @entity85 in his team ’s next home game effectively handed the initiative back to @entity20 and his @entity14 side			1
‘ they were very unlucky in that game against @entity85 but they were very lucky in the game they played against us because @entity97 had a very similar slip before their winning goal , ’ said the @entity90			0
‘ it was n’t exactly the same ( as @entity2 ’s slip ) , but very similar			0
of course i feel sorry for him			0
i always feel sorry for players who make a mistake but i do n’t think that slip decided the title			2
there were 38 games through the whole year and , anyway , it was not really a mistake			0
’ ‘ it was a problem with the pitch			0
it is not that he missed a pass inside the box or something			0
it was slippy , it can happen to any player			0
’ despite @entity3 ’s efforts last season , @entity74 and his team arrive in @entity124 on monday facing some questions			1
with @entity127 now a @entity129 player , many feel that @entity3 ’s title challenge has already been neutered			1
focused : @entity14 's @entity131 ( left to right ) , @entity132 and @entity133 in training determined : city host @entity3 at the @entity47 on monday night in a huge @entity136 clash talking tactics : @entity20 ( second left ) watches his players during training ahead of the @entity3 match one feels @entity20 suspects the same , even if he is too cute to say so directly			1
‘ it is very difficult to replace a player that did what @entity127 did last season , ’ he added			1
‘ it was a very important season for @entity127			2
maybe in his first year at @entity3 it was not so important for him			2
‘ but to replace what he did last year is very difficult			2
but i suppose with all the players they bought they will do it			0
’ @entity3 manager @entity74 has occasionally spoken a little dismissively of @entity14 ’s own approach to the transfer market , suggesting that the @entity158 club do things ‘ differently ’			1
again , though , @entity20 has no time for the criticism			2
‘ it was very important the way we finished the season last year , not only to win the games in the @entity136 but also to demonstrate the character of this team , ’ stressed @entity20			1
‘ a lot of media always talk about money , but this is not money			0
you ca n’t do that just with money - you can do it with character , personality , with style of play , a lot of things			2
‘ maybe we have to discuss longer about that some day but always when we win it is not about money			0
‘ i am absolutely sure that if you do not spend money on a good squad it is impossible to win the @entity188 teams spend money also			0
this year there are a lot of teams who have spent more than us			0
‘ so it is not about money			0
it is money in the sense you need a strong squad but there are lot of things after the money you must do if you want to be champions			0
’ iconic : @entity3 captain @entity2 's celebration after the match in april is engrained in the memory			1

@entity14 lost 3 - 2 at @entity10 in april but went on to win title
@entity20 believes that defeat *spurred* @entity14 on to win the @entity136
he says the defeat was unjust and they did not get the decisions
the @entity14 boss refers to that match as a ' turning point ' in the title race
it meant that @entity14 knew they would have to win all five remaining matches
@entity20 says it will be ' very difficult ' for @entity3 to replace @entity127
