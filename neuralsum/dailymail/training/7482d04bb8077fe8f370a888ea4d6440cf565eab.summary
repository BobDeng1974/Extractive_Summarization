mystery has surrounded the death of @entity2 , the first man to journey into space @entity2 made history in 1961 when , aged just 27 , he became the first man to journey into space			1
his single @entity10 orbit on april 12 lasted 108 minutes and was one of the @entity14 's most enduring @entity13 victories			1
seven years later , the @entity16 cosmonaut was killed in a crash during a training flight - an event that has been shrouded in mystery ever since			0
among the conspiracy theories were that he was murdered on the orders of @entity14 leader @entity23 for an unspecified offence or disloyalty to the party ; @entity2 had committed suicide ; or that the plane had actually hit a @entity29			1
@entity31 archives declassified in early 2011 concluded that his @entity33 jet had swerved to avoid a weather balloon , causing the plane to go into a tailspin and hit the ground , killing him instantly			1
but after 40 years of secrecy , the real cause of @entity2 's death can be revealed , courtesy of fellow cosmonaut @entity41			1
@entity41 , who was the first man to make a spacewalk , in 1965 , had been part of an official committee set up to investigate the accident			1
more importantly , he had been there on that fateful day in march			0
and now , following the release of a newly declassified report - which @entity41 has been allowed to make public - the 79 - year - old can finally reveal the actual chain of events ; something he has wanted to do for 20 years			1
seen here in 1963 are @entity2 ( centre ) with @entity55 first secretary @entity54			2
five years later , the @entity16 cosmonaut died in a crash during a training flight @entity41 , who was the first man to make a spacewalk , in 1965 ( pictured ) , had been part of an official committee set up to investigate the accident			1
more importantly , he had been there on that fateful day in march when @entity2 's @entity33 went into a tailspin after apparently hitting a weather balloon , and crashed to the ground ' that [ original ] conclusion is believable to a civilian , not to a professional - but in fact , everything went down differently , ' @entity41 told @entity70			1
he explained that an unauthorised su - 15 fighter jet was flying dangerously close to @entity2 ’s aircraft			2
@entity41 said : ' in this case , the pilot did n’t follow the book , descending to an altitude of 450 metres			2
' i know this because i was there ; i heard the sound and talked to witnesses			0
' while afterburning , the aircraft reduced its echelon [ plane formation ] at a distance of 10 - 15 metres in the clouds , passing close to @entity2 , turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin – a deep spiral , to be precise – at a speed of 750 kilometres per hour , ' he told the @entity16 website			1
@entity41 was well - placed to give such testimony			2
he had overseen parachute jump training at @entity97 , northeast of @entity98 - from where @entity2 had set out			2
at this point in his career , @entity2 was deputy training director of the @entity101 and was starting out as a fighter pilot again ( as he had been in 1960 )			2
after being allowed to make public his remarks after a newly declassified report was released , @entity41 revealed that an unauthorised su - 15 fighter jet ( file picture , above ) was flying dangerously close to @entity2 's aircraft			1
it was this that caused his plane to go into a spin and crash above , a statue of @entity2 outside the @entity114 's headquarters in central @entity115 major @entity2 at a reception at @entity118 for the @entity119 due to bad weather , @entity41 had been awaiting official confirmation that exercises would be cancelled that day , march 27			1
he then heard a supersonic sound followed by an explosion seconds later			0
reports of the calamity , near the village of @entity128 , soon filtered back to the base			0
@entity41 formed part of the @entity131 investigating the accident - and after finally gaining access to it , he discovered a litany of distorted facts			1
even though his comments had his name attached , they had been written by someone else			0
' marked here was a sonic spike , a blast , followed by one - and - a - half or two seconds of supersonic noise ... so , when i looked at the copy , i suddenly noticed that it stated this noise interval to be 15 to 20 seconds long instead of the two seconds that i had reported			0
' that suggested that the two jets must have been no less than 50km apart , ' he told @entity70 @entity41 knew that @entity2 's jet had plunged for 55 seconds at a speed of 750km , and made his own calculations			1
' we used a computer to figure out a trajectory that would relate to this interval of 55 seconds			0
and it turned out to be a deep spiral			0
now , a jet can sink into a deep spiral if a larger , heavier aircraft passes by too close and flips it over with its backwash			0
' and that is exactly what happened to @entity2			0
that trajectory was the only one that corresponded with all our input parameters			0
' however , there remains one further question - who was the other pilot ? the man responsible for the death of @entity2 is still alive , aged 80 , and in poor health			1
but as part of the deal of him going public , @entity41 has been sworn to secrecy , and has promised never to reveal his identity			2
@entity2 as a student at @entity183 in 1955 the 19 candidates selected for the @entity186 - 1 flight were all test pilots , unafraid of speed , and slight enough in build to fit into the tiny 2m - wide ( 6ft ) capsule			2
the @entity14 - era charm of @entity2 's humble roots may have favored him over others , including his backup @entity194			1
born in the village of @entity197 , some 150km ( 95 miles ) west of @entity98 , @entity2 's father was a carpenter and his mother a milkmaid			1
the family was forced to live in a tiny mud hut when the village was burned down during the @entity204 occupation in @entity205			0
' @entity206 ( @entity2 ) was a very quick learner			0
his mind was stellar , ' veteran @entity14 space journalist @entity209 said			2
@entity2 sung @entity14 hymns during the last checks , strapped atop the 30m - high ( 98 ft ) rocket that would blast him into space from the long - secret @entity215 on the @entity217 steppe			1
' @entity218 ! ( @entity219 ) , ' he cried , in a phrase that has become synonymous with @entity2 in @entity16			0
' the most emotional moment was when we heard he was walking and waving ; his arms and legs were whole			0
' we understood in one sigh that our five to six years of hard work had paid off and we had achieved something huge , ' veteran cosmonaut @entity225 said			0
the @entity229 responded 10 months later , when @entity230 made the first @entity229 orbital flight			0
the @entity233 capsule and the spacesuit worn by @entity2			0

original report : ' his *mig* hit weather balloon , went into tailspin and crashed '
eye witness @entity41 , first man to walk in space , reveals truth
@entity41 was part of @entity14 probe into *34* - year - old @entity2 's death
another plane was *involved* - at a much closer *proximity* to that suggested by the @entity31 - but pilot responsible , who is still alive , is granted *anonymity*
