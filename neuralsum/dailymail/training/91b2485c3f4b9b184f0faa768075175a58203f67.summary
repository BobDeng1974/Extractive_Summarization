by @entity0 for the @entity1 sir @entity2 , the country ’s top family law judge , said allowing the press to see files would allow reporters to understand sensitive cases better secretive documents on cases in the family courts could be disclosed to the @entity11 to help them ‘ perform their watchdog role ’ , a leading judge said yesterday			1

cases of children being taken from their parents into state care , adoption , and where children should live when families break up are normally held behind closed doors or have strict reporting restrictions			2
members of the public could also be permitted into the family courts to watch their secretive hearings			0
the proposals , outlined in a consultation document , are a boost to the @entity1 ’s campaign against court cases being held in private after we exposed a series of scandals resulting from justice being conducted in private			2

unveiling his plans on ending secrecy in the family courts , sir @entity2 said : ‘ there is a need for greater transparency in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system			1
