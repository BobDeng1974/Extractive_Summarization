by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 6 october 2012 wearing body armour and helmets and brandishing sub-machine guns , these police officers are leaving nothing to chance as they hunt down their quarry			2
is it a cornered knife maniac they are about to confront – or a bank robber toting a sawn - off shotgun ? er , no. they ’re up against an escaped cow – a terrified young heifer which has made a dash for freedom from a livestock market			1
@entity20 hunting : police armed with sub-machine guns , pictured , patrolled a street in rural @entity24 before shooting an escaped cow the animal leapt over a cattle grid and ran down a bypass and residential streets in the town of @entity31 in central @entity24			1
police were called – and soon officers arrived armed with @entity35 semi- automatic machine guns			1
the cow ’s freedom was shortlived because when the animal had been cornered it was shot dead			1
last night residents in the town condemned the police reaction			2
shot : police said attempts to round up the animal , pictured , failed so they had to ' destroy ' it team effort : local farmers and an auctioneer , pictured , assisted police in locating the cow @entity51 , who saw the incident , said the response was ‘ over the top ’			1
she said : ‘ it was awful			0
why did they have to shoot it ? there was no need , it was only a heifer			0
if it was a bull then i would understand but it ’s only a heifer			0
’ another resident said : ‘ it was completely unnecessary			0
farmers have to catch runaway cows all the time so they did n’t have to go and shoot it dead like that			0
i think it ’s dreadful			0
‘ why did n’t they let it calm down and then take it back to the market ? it ’s wrong and a massive over-reaction			0
’ the drama happened just after 9am on monday when the animal fled the livestock market and ended up in the back garden of a house			1
police officers were joined by farmers and an auctioneer as they tried to assess how agitated the animal was			2
the property was cordoned off and after more than two hours a police marksman was called in to put the heifer down			2
as he set up station at the rear of the property with his rifle , two colleagues stood ready with sub-machine guns			0
bystanders were moved away while the marksman fired four shots to kill the heifer			0
concerned : residents , pictured , feared for their safety with the cow on the loose , however some said the shooting was ' over the top ' mad dash : witnesses , pictured , saw the plucky heifer make a dash for it from @entity109 on monday a police spokesman said : ‘ we received a report at approximately 9.10am this morning that a cow had escaped from @entity109			1
‘ there were concerns for the safety of the general public and police personnel together with a risk of damage to property within the area			2
the only safe option left was to humanely destroy the animal			1
