the @entity2 is thought to bring in $ 7billion per year in donations , most of which come from wealthy adherents like @entity6 presidential nominee @entity5			0
relying heavily on church records in countries that require far more disclosure than the @entity10 , @entity12 sociologist @entity11 and @entity13 were able to learn a great deal more about the financial backing of the often misunderstood religion			1
the church claims 14 million members around the world , more than half outside the @entity10			1
all are supposed to tithe , or give 10 per cent , of their income , which @entity2 frequently interpret as pre-tax earnings			1
but only about 40 per cent of @entity2 counted by the church actually attend weekly services in the @entity10 and @entity27 , and in many countries , including @entity29 and @entity30 , only a quarter of nominal members are active , according to @entity33 , an independent research group headed by a devoted , active @entity2			1
wealthy world : a study of the @entity2 church 's global financial statements estimates that it collects an estimated $ 7billion per year largely from members of the church these active members are most likely to tithe , and the result is that from a financial standpoint at least , the church remains largely a venture of active @entity10 members , says mr @entity11 , who adds that @entity10 @entity2 men tend to be wealthier than the average @entity10 male			1
' most of the revenue of the religion is from the @entity10 , and a large percentage comes from an elite cadre of wealthy donors , like @entity5 , ' said mr @entity11			1
' ( it ) is a religion that appeals to economically successful men by rewarding their financial acuity with respect and positions of prestige within the religion			2
' the church is full of successful businessmen , including chemical billionaire @entity62 , the father of the former presidential candidate , @entity65 ' @entity64 and his hotel - owning family , and even entertainer @entity67			2
@entity5 gave $ 4.1million to the church over the past two years ( amounting to 9.7 per cent of his gross adjusted income , according to the two years ' worth of tax returns he has released )			1
he would tithe on his @entity72 , valued at as much as $ 102million , only when he withdraws from it and pays taxes			0
several countries around the world require religious groups and charities to file financial reports , including @entity27			1
the country has only 185,000 mormon members but a wealth of statistics on them			2
big donor : @entity5 gave $ 4.1million to the church over the past two years ( amounting to 9.7 per cent of his gross adjusted income , according to the two years ' worth of tax returns he has released ) taking total reported @entity27 donations and dividing by the estimated number of active @entity2 and family financial data from the @entity92 indicates that active @entity27 mormons give slightly less than 8 per cent of their income to the church			1
assuming that active @entity10 @entity2 give at a similar rate and adjusting for higher @entity10 income , total @entity10 tithing would amount to more than $ 6billion , or about $ 6.5billion annually between the @entity10 and @entity27			1
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and the @entity103 , which also require financial disclosures , all have sharply lower donation rates than @entity27			1
based on data from those countries , tithing outside the @entity10 and @entity27 totals several hundred million dollars , taking global total donations to about $ 7 billion			1
@entity27 also requires the church to disclose the value of its assets and spending			2
using those figures as a basis suggests the total value of church buildings , including temples and meeting houses , would be about $ 35billion globally			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity119 declined to comment specifically on the estimates but said that the church was different from a corporation			1
' other projections are speculative and do not reflect an understanding of how the church uses its income to bless the lives of people , ' he added , saying the church was financed primarily from member tithing and offerings			1
concerned or disgruntled current and former mormons complain that the church spends too much on real estate and for - profit ventures , neglecting charity work			2
priorities : concerned or disgruntled current and former @entity2 complain that the church spends too much on real estate - like it 's main temple in @entity142 , @entity143 - and for - profit ventures , neglecting charity work the @entity2 church has no hospitals and only a handful of primary schools			2
its university system is limited to widely respected @entity151 , which has campuses in @entity143 , @entity153 and @entity154 , and @entity155			0
seminaries and institutes for high school students and single adults offer religious studies for hundreds of thousands			0
it counts more than 55,000 in its missionary forces , primarily youths focused on converting new members but also seniors who volunteer for its non-profits , such as the @entity169 , which bills itself as @entity154 's no. 1 tourist attraction , and for - profit businesses owned by the church			1
the church has plowed resources into a multi-billion - dollar global network of for - profit enterprises : it is the largest rancher in the @entity10 , a church official told @entity180 's @entity179 in 2004 , with other ranches and farms in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity183 , @entity100 and @entity184 , according to financial documents reviewed by @entity13			1
ranching and farm industry sources say they are well - run operations			0
it also has a small media empire , an investment fund , and is developing a mall across from its @entity142 headquarters , which it calls an attempt to help revitalize the city rather than to make money			0
these enterprises are also part of a vast nest egg for tough times			0
the church expects wars and natural disasters before @entity203 returns to earth in the @entity205 , and members are encouraged to prepare by laying in stores of food			1
farms and ranches are part of the church 's own preparation			2
' the church teaches its members to live within their means and put a little money aside for life 's unexpected events			2
as a church , we live by the same principle , ' @entity119 said			0
the rainy - day fund and operating budget rarely mix , officials say			0
well known adherents : the church is full of successful businessmen , including @entity5 , billionaire @entity62 the father of @entity5 's former opponent , @entity65 ' @entity64 and his hotel - owning family , and even entertainer @entity67 controversial selling point : though @entity5 's @entity234 was a potential issue during the beginning of the presidential campaign , it has subsided since he became the presumptive nominee cost - cutting is a top priority , church documents show			0
it has even laid off janitors and called on members to clean temples and meeting houses , but the buildout of temples continues , including one under construction in @entity250			0
those temples take a lot of money to operate , @entity119 points out , and many of the grand church buildings are short on congregants , says @entity257 , a physician who leads research group @entity33			0
' i have been to beautiful church buildings in @entity260 and @entity261 , and @entity262 and other places , and there are these huge buildings and 35 people there , and you say , how can this work financially ? the math - it just does n't work , ' @entity257 said			0
â€˜ the seventh - day @entity272 , which had about 17 million members a year ago , appears to be getting a better return on investment : it builds smaller meeting houses and lots of schools and hospitals , and its numbers are swelling faster than the @entity2 ' , said @entity257			1
the @entity282 claim a million new members join annually , compared with every three years or so for the @entity2			2
' the seventh - day @entity282 clearly have a much more expansive humanitarian project in terms of building hospitals and medical schools and schools and universities and long - term developmental infrastructure around the world , ' said @entity257			0
' it 's paid off for them			0
' the @entity2 church , meanwhile , appears to be decreasing transparency and member control of donations			0
new tithing slips give fewer donation options and come with an expanded disclaimer saying the church has sole discretion over spending , even though it will make ' reasonable efforts ' to follow donors ' wishes			2
@entity119 did offer a list of spending priorities : building houses of worship , supporting @entity151 and a seminary system , operating nearly 140 temples and the world 's largest genealogy research program , and humanitarian aid for both members and non-members			0
since 1985 the church has spent a total of $ 1.4billion on relief for disasters such as @entity325 's earthquake and @entity327 famine , and it operates 129 ' bishops ' storehouses ' with food and household items for the needy			0
@entity5 himself focuses on the act of giving , not the result			0
as he told @entity337 sunday , ' hopefully , as people look at various individuals running for president , they 'd be pleased with someone who made a promise to @entity343 and kept that promise			0
