by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:25 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 12:20 est , 23 october 2012 @entity2 may be known for its grey , downbeat television thrillers , but something has recently brought a smile to their faces : a contender for the world 's most ' ridiculously photogenic ' policeman			2
@entity12 posted a photo of himself with a lost puppy on @entity15 in a bid to find the animal 's owner - and overnight became the most desirable man in @entity20			1
officer @entity12 , who is based at a station in @entity23 , a suburb south of @entity24 , put the picture of himself and the @entity26 on the station 's @entity15 page alongside the message : ' is there someone missing this little fellow , we found him wednesday night and he is now at our police station			1
' ladies ' man : police officer @entity12 has become the most wanted single man in @entity20 after posting a photo of himself with a missing puppy on @entity15 last week little did he know that the post would go viral and he would be inundated with messages from admiring ladies			1
the picture has now been liked by some 25,000 women and over 1,700 comments have been posted commenting on the young officer 's @entity45 good looks			1
its incredible popularity has brought comparisons between officer @entity12 and the ' @entity51 ' meme that went viral in april , making a worldwide star of handsome @entity53			1
under the photo of officer @entity12 , one lustful lady wrote : ' too bad the guy in the picture is not missing , i could really think of taking care of him			1
' another said : ' it is war now ladies , the man in uniform is mine			2
' mr @entity12 is shocked by the attention			1
while he has not been on a date with any of the women , he has received lots of offers - some more graphic than others - in recent days			1
' i 'd love two for the price of one			2
' ' i want make him dinner , have him in my kitchen right now			2
' ' i want to go on a date with the guy in the picture , we can get a dog later			2
' ' @entity84 take the policeman , somebody else can take the dog			2
' ' it is war now ladies , the man in uniform is mine ' ' he can sleep on my stomach			0
the dog can sleep on the sofa			0
' ' never mind the dog , i want to take that little fellow in uniform with me home			0
' the officer said : ' i have my own dog , he is a four - year - old rottweiler named @entity103			0
i guess i have some explaining to do when i come home and meet him now			0
' the photo has also been shared by more than 2,000 people and some comments have been written by excited women as far afield as @entity110 and @entity111			1
at the small police station where he works , mr @entity12 's colleagues are now having some fun at his expense			1

' admirers : mr @entity12 's army of female fans stretches way beyond @entity20 the ' @entity51 ... ' trend began when photographer @entity134 took a picture of @entity53 running the 10km @entity137 run in his hometown of @entity139 , @entity140			1
the photograph was posted on @entity142 and mr @entity53 became an internet sensation - even appearing on television show @entity144 as @entity51			0
he was followed by @entity146 - also known as @entity147 - who became a similar internet sensation after posting a photograph of herself in hospital as she recovered from lung surgery			0
the internet 's eye was then - bizarrely - drawn to the @entity155 civil war , where a handsome soldier carrying a grenade launcher liberated people 's hearts with his smouldering looks to become ridiculously photogenic @entity155 rebel			0
it was only a matter of time before a sports star became the focus of the craze , and @entity168 wide receiver @entity167 's smile for the camera as he scored a touchdown three weeks ago was the textbook ' ridiculously ... ' photo opportunity			2
the moment will be recorded in sports history for nothing more than the six points , but to those in the know it will be forever remembered as the birth of @entity179 .			0

@entity12 found the adorable @entity26 a week ago
he has since received over 1,700 comments from admiring women
