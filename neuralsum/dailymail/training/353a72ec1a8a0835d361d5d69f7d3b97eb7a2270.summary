by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 6 september 2013 the @entity1 is under pressure to review the ‘ dangerous ’ decision not to charge two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions for women who did not want girls			1
there was anger yesterday at the decision by the @entity11 not to bring the cases to court , even though officials admitted there was a realistic prospect of conviction			1
the @entity1 , @entity18 , said it was ‘ a very difficult and finely balanced decision ’ but would reveal no more details about why it was reached			1
the reasons would be made public ‘ in due course ’			1
a @entity11 official said that pursuing the case was deemed not to be in the public interest because no abortions were carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by their professional body , the @entity30			1
@entity18 , the director of public prosecutions , says the @entity11 will not charge two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions for women who did not want girls health secretary @entity34 has asked attorney general @entity35 for ‘ urgent clarification ’ of the reasons , and said abortion for reasons of gender selection is ‘ completely unacceptable ’			1
nineteen months ago , the two doctors were secretly filmed by undercover journalists from @entity42 having consultations with pregnant women who pretended they wanted an abortion only because of the sex of their unborn child			2
this is illegal under the @entity49 , which states that abortion is allowed up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy if having the baby poses a risk to the mental or physical health of mother or child			0
one consultant , @entity57 who worked for private and @entity59 hospitals in @entity60 , was recorded telling a woman : ‘ i do n’t ask questions			0
if you want a termination , you want a termination			0
’ at the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , dr @entity66 was also filmed agreeing to the procedure , telling the woman he would put down on the paperwork that she was too young			0
sources close to the @entity74 investigation told the newspaper the cases were not being pursued for ‘ political ’ reasons because the case was ‘ sensitive ’			1
yesterday shadow attorney general @entity79 said the decision not to prosecute was ‘ scandalous ’			1
@entity57 who worked for private and @entity59 hospitals in @entity60 , was recorded telling a woman : ¿ i don ¿ t ask questions			0
if you want a termination , you want a termination ¿ in a strongly - worded letter to mr @entity89 , she demanded he urgently review the decision , which she said would ‘ completely undermine ’ efforts to tackle violence against women and girls , and @entity95 , which makes the laws			2
‘ this is a profound mistake ’ , she told the @entity97			2
‘ are they saying people who have a professional body should be pursued that way , and only people who do n’t have one need to go to court and face criminal charges ? this is ridiculous on so many levels			0
‘ abortion on grounds of gender selection is a terrible crime , and the law is crystal clear on this			0
’ official statistics released last year showed unusual variation in ratios of boys and girls born to mothers from certain countries			0
mr @entity89 ’s predecessor , lord @entity121 , said he hoped the decision not to prosecute had not been made for reasons of cultural sensitivity			0
he said : ‘ these offences are obviously sensitive , they are very difficult to detect and the statistics seem to show that they may be becoming more common in certain communities , so where they are detected i would have thought there ’s a strong public interest in prosecuting them ... to deter other people			1
‘ i certainly hope it ’s not [ for cultural reasons ] because that would be a serious error and it would lead to partiality in prosecution decisions			0
’ lord @entity121 told @entity140 ’s today programme it was ‘ a highly dubious proposition ’ to say a professional alleged to have committed a crime should only answer to their regulator , and avoid charges			2
@entity146 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for @entity147 , said allowing a termination on the basis of sex selection alone was a criminal offence			0
but officials had ruled there was no public interest in pursuing it because no abortion was actually carried out and because the doctors could be suspended or struck off by the @entity30			1
‘ on balance there is enough evidence to justify bringing proceedings for an attempt , ’ she said			2
‘ the evidence in this case was finely balanced and the law gives quite a wide discretion to doctors to determine when a risk to the health and well - being of a pregnant woman exists			2

prosecutors will not bring case against the two doctors
@entity11 said the case was deemed not to be in the public interest
shadow attorney general called decision ‘ scandalous ’
