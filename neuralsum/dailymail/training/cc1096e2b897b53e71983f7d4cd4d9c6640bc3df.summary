a 1,200 - year - old @entity1 manuscript tells the story of the crucifixion with incredible plot twists - including the revelation that @entity6 could change shape			1
the ancient illuminated text 's claim explains why @entity10 used a kiss to betray @entity6 , since the @entity12 had the ability to transform his appearance			1
it also claims @entity6 in fact spent his last supper with the man who ordered his execution , @entity21 prefect @entity20 , who is said to have offered to sacrifice his own son in @entity6 ' place			1
@entity25 's ' @entity26 ' : a newly deciphered manuscript claims @entity6 could change shape at will and in fact had his last supper with @entity20 , the @entity21 prefect who sentenced him to death and it defies the official @entity34 timeline by putting the day of @entity6 ' arrest on tuesday evening , rather than the canonically agreed thursday			1
the translation from the original @entity37 has been revealed for the first time in a new book by @entity40 , emeritus professor of the history of @entity42 at @entity43 in the @entity44			0
in the commonly - accepted @entity47 story it is claimed that the apostle @entity10 agrees to betray @entity6 in exchange for cash , then kissed him to reveal his identity			1
a recently uncovered fragment of ancient papyrus makes the explosive suggestion that @entity6 and @entity55 were man and wife , researchers say			2
the 8cm by 4cm fragment supports an undercurrent in @entity42 thought that undermines centuries of @entity63 dogma by suggesting the @entity12 was not celibate			0
the centre of the fragment contains the bombshell phrase where @entity6 , speaking to his disciples , says ' my wife ' , which researchers believe refers to @entity55			2
in the text , @entity6 appears to be defending her against some criticism , saying ' she will be my disciple '			2
two lines later he then tells the disciples : ' i dwell with her			0
' if genuine , the document casts doubt on a centuries old official representation of @entity55 as a repentant whore and overturns the @entity42 ideal of sexual abstinence			0
however , since the papyrus emerged last november , scholars have queued up to cast doubt on its authenticity			0
the newly - deciphered text explains that , far from a sign of affection or guilt , the kiss was @entity10 ' way of forestalling any shapeshifting confusion			1
' the @entity95 said to @entity10 : how shall we arrest him [ @entity6 ] , for he does not have a single shape but his appearance changes			1
sometimes he is ruddy , sometimes he is white , sometimes he is red , sometimes he is wheat coloured , sometimes he is pallid like ascetics , sometimes he is a youth , sometimes an old man ... ' it reads			0
for a man who could walk on water , raise the dead , feed 5,000 people with just a single loaf of bread and a fish , and turn water into wine , such abilities are perhaps unsurprising			0
but shapeshifting is not the only superpower the ancient manuscript attributes to @entity6 - it also says that he could even turn himself invisible			1
it claims that on the night before his crucifixion , @entity6 ate dinner with @entity20 , the @entity21 prefect who decided his sentence - who , it is said , remarkably offered his son to be crucified in place of the @entity123			1
@entity6 declined the offer , explaining that if he could escape from his fate if he wanted to			1
' @entity20 , then , looked at @entity6 and , behold , he became incorporeal : he did not see him for a long time , ' the text says			1
later that night , according to the manuscript , @entity20 and his wife dreamed of an eagle representing @entity6 being killed			1
the incredible text , which is thought to be some 1,200 years old , is written in the name of @entity132 , although , professor van den @entity40 says , it was probably written by someone else			0
back then it was looked after by monks at the @entity136 in the desert of north - west @entity138 , south of @entity139			2
the text was rediscovered in 1910 and , the following year , it was bought along with other manuscripts by the wealthy @entity143 financier @entity142			0
@entity142 's collections were later given to the public and they are now kept in the @entity146 in @entity147			0
a scene from the film ' @entity150 ' : the new manuscript offers a very different account of the days and events leading up to the death of @entity6 from the conventional one given by the @entity47 professor van den @entity40 told @entity156 that the @entity47 was already canonised in @entity138 by the time the text was written , but that such apocryphal stories nevertheless remained popular among believers			2
he said he was not convinced that the monk who wrote down the story necessarily believed all the details in it , ' but some details , for instance the meal [ @entity20 had ] with @entity6 , he may have believed to have really happened			2
' ' the people of that time , even if they were well - educated , did not have a critical historical attitude , ' he added			0
' @entity170 were quite possible , and why should an old story not be true ? ' professor van den @entity40 's book , @entity173 on the life and the @entity175 , is out now , published by @entity176 .			0

claim explains why @entity10 used a kiss to betray @entity6 , since he could have transformed to foil any *attempt* at *description*
manuscript also claims that @entity20 offered his own son for crucifixion in place of the @entity123 - but @entity6 declined
