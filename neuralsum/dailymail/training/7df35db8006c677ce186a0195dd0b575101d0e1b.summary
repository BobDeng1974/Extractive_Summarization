by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 22 february 2013 pub regulars have celebrated saving their beloved local from being turned into a @entity2 after a 16 month campaign			1
the retail giant planned a new @entity5 on the site of the @entity8 pub in @entity9 , @entity10			1
but the scheme was rebuffed by planners and villagers , who waged a bitter battle against the grocery chain 's plans to extend and convert the pub. the pub was the latest in a long list proposed to be converted into outlets for supermarket chains			1
regulars including @entity23 ( front ) celebrate outside the @entity8 pub in @entity9 , @entity26 , after successfully fighting off plans for supermarket giants @entity2 to take over the pub there have been with more than 200 conversions in @entity32 since 2010			1
villagers accused @entity2 of ' sheer arrogance ' as they repeatedly applied for planning permission to convert the pub. but councillors and residents have refused to let the multi-million pound supermarket chain ' grind them down ' and vowed to save their local pub. councillors had been a shown letter from the pub 's owners @entity42 , which backs the convenience store plans and said the pub would have shut anyway			1
the company said : ' tenants have been unable to derive any sustainable profit due to the very low levels of trade and high outgoings			0
' and for punch the inevitable alternative may be to close and board the property			0
' but current manager @entity56 rejected the claims , agreeing that when @entity2 first looked to take over the @entity8 it had been struggling , but in recent months business was booming			1
' before we took over , the pub was , as @entity2 say , not a going concern , ' he said			2
' but trade has more than trebled in the last 16 to 17 months and it 's now a real amenity for the village			2
' but at a boisterous meeting of the south east area planning committee of @entity69 on tuesday night , councillors voiced their concerns that allowing the conversion would ultimately lead to a death on the road outside			0
the pub is situated on a notorious blind bend in the village , prompting safety fears			2
the retail giant planned a new @entity5 on the site but the scheme was rebuffed by planners and villagers , who waged a bitter battle against the grocery chain 's plans to extend and convert the pub councillor @entity87 said that the idea of delivery lorries having to pull into and out of the proposed loading area outside the store was ' a recipe for disaster , ' while fellow councillor @entity94 said he and his members had a ' duty of care ' to the people of @entity10			1
' i find it really offensive to see @entity2 coming to us yet again in the hope it grinds us down , ' he said			0
' it seems they hope we will get bored and let it through , but i 'm not going to let that happen			0
' an application for a 108 square metre extension to the pub was rejected on the grounds of road safety			2
a separate application for two air conditioning units and a condenser was rejected on the grounds it could be an eyesore and create a noise nuisance for nearby homes			0
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' we are disappointed by the decision , especially as the applications had a positive recommendation from the council 's own officers			2
' we will now consider our options and decide on the way forward			0
' but villager @entity23 , who has led the campaign to save the pub , said he hoped this might finally be the end of the saga			0
he said : ' hopefully we 've now seen the back of this application that is clearly lacking any credibility			0
' last year , a co-operative supermarket was given the go - ahead , which could create up to 60 jobs , at a different site in the village .			1
