by @entity1 reporter published : 16:16 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 01:40 est , 17 may 2013 a scale model of the @entity3 built in @entity4 was key to getting the @entity6 raid off the ground			1
as anniversary events take place throughout the country to mark to 1943 raid , these replica models are tributes to the planning and strategy behind the daring raid			1
the model was built in 1941 , two years before the raid , across a brook to simulate real conditions			1
idyllic : tucked away in the @entity4 countryside the humble replica dam is a piece of history higher cause : the small - scale recreation was built in the same way as the target @entity29 and @entity32 dams , using the same masonry techniques tourist attraction : secret meetings to plan the raids were held on the site in @entity4 part of history : @entity40 visits the 50th scale model dam in 1997			1
his father masterminded the raid and the bouncing bomb it was tested in the run up to the attack when decisions were still to be made about how heavy the bombs should be and where they would be dropped			1
it took seven weeks to build and was made out of a scaled - down form of masonry , composed of mortar blocks , identical to the intended target			2
explosive tests were then carried out on the replica			1
three trusted employees of the @entity59 in @entity4 , worked on the covert model			2
bursting through : the replica dam was tested in the research phase of @entity63 small scale : the replica was tested at different points , so the strategists could plan where to bomb work in progress : theses images show the replica dam as it was constructed			1
it was built over a brook so that it was an accurate representation of the real thing @entity76 : the replica dam was designed to prepare an effective strategy for future air raids on @entity81 dams then and now : the model dam was built over seven weeks			1
the team of three engineers worked tirelessly to recreate the shape of the target			0
today , visitors can see the model dam where it was built in @entity4 meetings between @entity40 , the inventor of the @entity90 and dr @entity91 , head of engineering at @entity59 , took place at the site near @entity4			1
@entity40 ' plans to attack the @entity29 and @entity32 dams were outlined and the the model dam was used for testing his strategies			0
the model dam 's discovery was published as the final shots for the film @entity103 were being recorded			2
the very first tests at @entity59 were not included in the film			2
the raid was carried out by 133 airmen in 19 @entity108 bombers from the specifically formed 617 squadron			0
anniversary celebration : a flypast at @entity112 today marked the 70th anniversary of the raid			1
the iconic @entity108 bomber was watched by hundreds @entity117 : the @entity29 dam in @entity81 's @entity119			0
catastrophic flooding tot he surrounding area was caused in the raid film history : the attack was immortalised by the 1955 film starring @entity127 and @entity128 marvel of engineering : the dam at @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity81 was breached in the raid			0
surrounding villages were badly flooded @entity136 : the @entity63 was an attempt to cripple a major part of the @entity139 war economy by hitting the industrial heartland of @entity81 it was an attempt to cripple a major part of the @entity139 war economy by carrying out attacks on three dams in the industrial heartland of @entity81			0
it is considered one of the @entity150 's most famous @entity149 successes			1
the top - secret mission , codenamed @entity63 , was led by wing commander @entity152 and was credited with boosting morale across @entity154			0
the planes , armed with scientist dr @entity40 ' bouncing bombs , flew to the @entity119 either side of midnight on may 16 , 1943			2
the @entity29 and @entity32 dams were breached during the raid and the @entity160 damaged			0
the attack was immortalised by the 1955 film starring @entity127 and @entity128			0
even with the loss of life , the operation was hailed an incredible success at the time but in recent decades historians have downplayed its effects			0
picturesque : @entity171 was targeted in the @entity63			0
the @entity29 and @entity172 were breached mission : eight aircraft , such as the @entity108 , failed to return from @entity63			2
three men became prisoners of war and 53 were killed @entity178 : taken two months after the bombing of the @entity181 , this aerial view shows the reservoir is completely dry after the attack : @entity184 gushed through the @entity3 after it was bombed by the @entity6 days gone by : wing commander @entity152 ( left ) , the commanding officer of @entity6 , and sir @entity40 ( right ) , inventor of the bouncing bomb , used in the @entity108 bomber raids on the dams			0

scale model built in 1941 used in the research phase of operation
*initial* tests included what kind of explosive would be used and where it would be dropped
@entity200 to one of the @entity149 's most successful @entity150 missions
events to mark the anniversary of the daring @entity172 raid of may 16 - 17 1943 took place today
