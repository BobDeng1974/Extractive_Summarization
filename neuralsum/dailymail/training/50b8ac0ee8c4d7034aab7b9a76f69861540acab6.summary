by @entity1 reporter ever felt that your fast food order did n't look quite as appetising as it did on the advert ? photographer @entity5 was fed up with disappointing purchases and decided to see how the food sold over the counter matched up to the promised product			1
he bought burgers and tacos from some of the biggest chains in the @entity14 and set them up in his studio for a professional standard photo shoot			0
and the difference was clear to see			0
photographer @entity5 decided to find out how many fast food products actually looked like their advert			1
this @entity20 could n't reach the same height as the advertised burger when the photographer opened the @entity20 , he found that it was missing most of its lettuce @entity5 even found that the advertised @entity20 would be far too big for its box the photographer found that most of the burgers he bought were not quite as tall as the adverts promised they would be			1
in fact , @entity20 would struggle to fit inside their boxes if they matched their picture			2
and another @entity31 's burger , the @entity32 , would have the same trouble			1
@entity5 embarked on the project following : ' a lifetime of disappointment , bafflement , and rage ' , posting the results on his website			2
he gave @entity42 's @entity41 a few tries , but after slightly squashed results could only conclude : ' they need to fire the guy who does his yoga on top of the @entity48			0
' but despite the generous lettuce , the photographer found that the advertised @entity32 was another @entity31 's burger that did not seem to fit in its box for this @entity32 third pounder burger , @entity5 praised the amount of lettuce it came with a @entity31 's @entity57 with cheese got a big green tick from @entity5 as the burger that most closely matched its advert in one side - by - side comparison , he showed the results of asking staff at different locations to make the @entity66 look like its advert			1
' both times , the cashiers turned and took strangely long , careful looks , as if nobody had ever requested that before , ' he said			0
' out of curiosity , @entity5 complained about the ' misleading ' adverts			2
a member of @entity42 's @entity74 replied : ' one may find the @entity75 as pictured in commercials more attractive because during photo sessions , professional food stylists are used to ensure the consistency and appearance			0
' when he bought a @entity41 from @entity42 , @entity5 found that his purchase fell a little flat compared with the one packed with tomato , lettuce , onion and pickles in the ad the photographer gave the @entity66 another try - but it still could n't quite live up to its promise @entity5 then asked two different branches of @entity42 to make burgers that looked like the advert - and these were the results it was n't just burger chains where the food failed to size up to its commercial counterpart			1
in @entity99 and @entity100 , the tacos were thin compared with the packed shells in the adverts			0
of the @entity99 results , he said : ' since these tacos are pretty dry and empty , i can only tolerate them with hot sauce , which , for me , is when they become good			0
' with the help of a greenscreen and rotating chair , @entity5 took each product 's photo at the most flattering angle he could before using digital software to show the advert and real product side - by - side			1
he said : ' i gave the items as fair a chance as absolutely possible '			0
this is what the photographer , who documented his findings on his blog , was handed when he asked for @entity42 's @entity41 burger it was n't just burgers that fell short of expectations			1
@entity5 bought the crunchy taco on the right from @entity99 , expecting something looking like the one on the left and at @entity14 brand @entity100 , the photographer bought four sets of tacos before deciding to photograph this pair - the best of the bunch			2

photographer @entity5 compared over the counter purchases with their ads
he found that two @entity31 's burgers would not fit in their boxes
some burgers could not reach the same heights as the promised products
