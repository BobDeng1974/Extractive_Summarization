by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 13:52 est , 11 january 2014 passed away : @entity2 , pictured , passed away on @entity3 a boy who spent more than half his young life has died after a battle with the same rare brain cancer which killed his cousin			1
@entity2 , nine , passed away on @entity3 from an agressive neuroblastoma			1
he had been diagnosed with the condition in february 2009 , aged four			1
and just six months after the diagnosis his cousin , @entity11 , died from the condition aged three			1
when he first fell ill aged four , two doctors missed the symptoms of his cancer			1
it took six months to diagnose him as suffering from a form of the disease called neuroblastoma , which affects the developing nerve cells of children			1
after chemotherapy at @entity26 in 2009 , the @entity24 paid for @entity2 to go to @entity27 for a first time to have antibody therapy			1
while there , doctors removed a tumour near his heart which , incredibly , his family had not even been told about			0
@entity2 was given the all - clear , but a follow - up scan revealed three cancerous lymph nodes in his abdomen			0
the @entity24 originally refused to fund potential lifesaving surgery at a @entity27 hospital for @entity2 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , which led his family to start a desperate fundraising campaign			1
they found the Â £ 8,000 needed for the operation , and were delighted to be told in march 2011 that @entity2 was in remission			0
the family were also reimbursed the cost of the treatment by the @entity24 after conservative mp @entity49 intervened on their behalf			1
packed up : @entity2 , pictured in 2012 with his parents @entity51 and @entity53 before his trip to @entity27 following intervention from their local @entity57 mp @entity49 the @entity24 did a u-turn and reimbursed the family for the costly treatment			1
but the cancer later spread to @entity2 's liver and he passed away at his home on 1 january alongside his parents , @entity51 , 44 , and @entity53 , 45			1
diagnoses : @entity2 , right , with his cousin @entity67 , after both had been diagnosed with neuorblastomata his mother yesterday said he was n't in any pain but confirmed his health had been ailing because the disease had spread to his liver			1
ms @entity11 said : ' we took him to @entity75 as our last - ditch attempt in november to a specialist oncologist , who was also a scientist			0
we found out then it had spread to his bone marrow			2
' we knew then that we had one hell of a fight			0
but at that point it was n't in his liver			0
but that 's the nature of the disease , it can happen that quickly			2
' all over @entity87 he deteriorated			0
we knew he did n't have long , he was poorly			0
@entity87 will never be the same again			0
' speaking in the @entity88 on wednesday , mr @entity49 said @entity2 will be ' greatly missed '			0
addressing commons leader @entity89 in the chamber , he said : this lovely , full - of - life , happy little boy passed away			2
he will be sadly and greatly missed			0
' however , without politicians of different parties working together he would not have had the last five years			2
' any funds raised by @entity2 's @entity97 , which has been raising money for his treatment , will now be used to help other children and their families fighting the disease			2
ms @entity11 added : ' this country offers nothing for relapse neuroblastoma			2
if you take accidents out of the equation , this disease is the single biggest killer of children			0
' how many more children have to die before something is done about it ? this ca n't be allowed to happen			0

@entity119 , nine , passed away on @entity120 , his parents said
he was diagnosed with a neuroblastoma when he was just four years old
six months later his cousin @entity67 also died from the disease , aged three
he was forced to go to @entity27 for treatment , which was refused by @entity24
it worked , but then the cancer spread , and he recently passed away
