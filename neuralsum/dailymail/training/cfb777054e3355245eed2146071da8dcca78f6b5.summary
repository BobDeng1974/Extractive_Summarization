on christmas day 1974 , police officer @entity0 emerged from what was left of his @entity3 house and thought : ' we must be the only ones left alive			1
' the city 's 45,000 inhabitants had spent a harrowing night lashed by winds so fierce they broke the recording equipment at the @entity9			1
at least 66 people were killed in the storm			1
@entity12 lashed down on @entity3 on christmas eve 1974 @entity0 likened the noise of the wind to a speeding train bearing down on his home			1
' it hit the house like a bloody giant sledgehammer and the house is heaving and moving , and the manhole cover disappears , and i get the torch and shine it up and the next minute the roof disappears , ' he says			0
although @entity3 did have a history of being periodically destroyed - by cyclones in the late 1800s and 1937 , and suffering extensive damage caused by @entity30 bombs in 1942 - the relentless fury of @entity12 would change the city forever			1
it levelled and altered its essential character			0
at least 66 people were killed in the storm winds were so fierce that they broke the recording equipment at the @entity9 as @entity0 puts it : ' those that went through it were different people to those that did n't			1
' @entity3 before @entity12 was still a frontier town of opportunity and promise			1
' it 's always been a place to come if you 're running away from something or looking for your next big chance , ' lord mayor @entity46 tells @entity53			0
@entity54 , who finished high school in 1974 , remembers her childhood as an outdoor idyll , hours spent playing along beaches and in the bush in a small town where everyone knew everyone else			0
one survivor likened the sound of the wind to that of a speeding train ' it was a dream , it was absolutely wonderful , ' she says			1
' but that freedom and sense of knowing everyone disappeared after the evacuation			0
' before @entity12 , there were n't many sophisticated buildings in @entity3			2
but once it was decided in 1975 that the city would be rebuilt - which was n't initially a certainty - things progressed rapidly			0
designs intended for homes in southern cities such as @entity81 or @entity82 were appropriated for @entity3 so houses could quickly be constructed for the returning population			2
survivors remember how the night changed the town forever , turning it from a town where everyone knew each other 's name to a sophisticated modern city @entity3 inhabitants say houses and building were built in identical - looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs @entity46 says this resulted in identical - looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs			1
the @entity100 's design was intended for @entity101 , and continues to be an example of some of the ' really stupid ' planning decisions , she says			1
the newly introduced cyclone construction code did n't preclude good design , ' but where there was a need to build fast and just get them up , then you do get things that are a bit square - blocky ' , @entity46 said			0
recently , planners considering the city 's master plan felt that modern @entity3 is ugly , she says			2
the @entity100 's design was intended for @entity101 , and continues to be an example of some of the ' really stupid ' planning decisions ' the city was reborn in the 1980s and that 's what you 've got , ugly architecture ; it 's a symptom of the time			1
' author @entity123 , in her book warning : the @entity125 , quoted resident @entity126 : ' it was like a forgotten backwater , really , back in the early seventies			0
but in 1980 it was almost as if the cyclone had done it a favour by blowing it off the map ... it had really blown the cobwebs out of the place			0
' @entity0 , who spent 18 years in the @entity135 from 1983 and has seen four decades of change , says @entity12 revitalised the city			2
' you see what @entity3 is today , ' he says			2
' i do n't think it would have grown nearly as quickly			0
' it was an exciting time ; it brought new people into the city , new opportunities , new businesses			0
' it was a time of optimism			0
as southern @entity149 struggled with high unemployment , @entity3 boomed , with the @entity151 slowly shaking off the grip of heavy - handed southern leadership that dominated the first few months after @entity12 ,			2
