published : 22:00 , 06 february 2015 updated : 23:20 , 06 february 2015 @entity1 buried their demons in @entity3 last minute – climbing out of a ‘ big hole ’ at 10 - 0 down to claim one of the most impressive and significant victories of recent years			1
this was a momentous result to launch the @entity10			0
the visitors were chronically weakened , or that was the theory anyway			0
instead , a team deprived of so many leading men trumped rivals who were at full strength and armed with greater experience and pedigree			0
for a time , the ghosts of @entity1 ’s record defeat in the same forbidding arena in 2013 appeared to be re-awakening , but this time @entity24 faced them down			1
this time , there was greater maturity and composed decision - making as the under - dogs turned the tables in ruthless fashion			2
@entity1 centre @entity32 scored the decisive try of the game as they won 16 - 21 against @entity37 on friday night @entity32 ( left ) evaded two tackles to breach the @entity37 defence before scoring under the posts at the @entity41 @entity32 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates as they celebrate his second half try during their @entity10 encounter @entity1 's stars celebrate their win against @entity37 in the changing rooms after friday night 's brilliant result @entity51 brothers @entity52 ( left ) and @entity53 are all smiles as @entity1 defy their underdogs tag and beat @entity37 @entity37 xv : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ( capt ) , @entity71 replacements : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 try : @entity62 conversion : @entity56 penalties : @entity56 ( 2 ) drop goals : @entity61 @entity1 xv : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity32 , @entity86 , may , @entity87 , @entity51 ; @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity24 ( capt ) , @entity95 replacements : @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 ; @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 tries : @entity85 , @entity32 conversions : @entity87 penalties : @entity87 ( 3 ) @entity32 ’s wonderful solo try after half - time was the tipping point in this tense contest and by the end , @entity1 were threatening to pull significantly clear of their broken opponents			1
it was an emphatic reversal of the widely - anticipated script and will ignite a belief among @entity117 and his squad that this can be the catalyst for a compelling title challenge			2
the magnitude of the outcome was clear to see from the reactions			0
high in the stand , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 embraced as euphoria swept the @entity130 coaching box			0
down below , @entity93 ’s first - pumping celebration symbolised the away team ’s wild delight			2
he deserved to cavort with delight			0
the @entity136 captain led @entity1 ’s cavalry charge of defiance			2
his ball - carrying and defensive work - rate reached herculean heights			2
yet , the victors had several heroes			0
@entity32 justified his recall with a conjuring act which was fully in keeping with his performances for @entity147 this season – when he scored after the break			1
up front , @entity88 delivered another imposing display and @entity91 was another @entity152 who appeared to thrive amid the typical hostility			0
most of all , there was a collective composure which showed that all the talk of progress since the last visit to these parts was more than mere hot air			0
taken in isolation , this was a high point of @entity117 ’s tenure ; a gallant triumph in the face of injury - induced adversity			2
in wider context , it will reverberate , not just through this championship but on into the @entity169			0
it would not have been upper-most in @entity152 minds before the game , but they will now feel that if they can conquer @entity37 in their capital , they can certainly see them off at @entity177 in their pool a showdown			2
for @entity180 , the second half last night was an alarming spectacle			0
his team were armed with their multitude of @entity185 and , despite often being short of attacking cohesion , they had gone into half - time 16 - 8 up			1
at home , with a fair share of territory and possession , they would have expected to kick on and lay the foundations for another fine campaign			0
the atmosphere at the @entity41 was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the players stepped out onto the pitch @entity37 fullback @entity56 kicked @entity37 into an early 3 - 0 lead with a penalty during the opening two minutes of the contest @entity37 ' bright start got even better when scrum - half @entity62 ( left ) ran past @entity1 wing @entity204 to score the game 's first try the scrum - half had the awareness to run closer to the posts and make it an easier conversion attempt for @entity56 the in - form 26 - year - old ( centre ) celebrates his try with @entity37 captain @entity69 ( right ) on friday night @entity56 duly kicked the resulting conversion as @entity37 took a 10 - 0 lead against their bitter rivals during the opening exchanges @entity1 soon responded though when wing @entity85 ( left ) touched down for @entity117 's side @entity85 's score was his first international try for @entity1 as they fought their way back into the match the 20 - year - old is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring against @entity37 at the @entity41 how the @entity10 table looks after the opening game in @entity3 on friday instead , they will be condemned to a harsh inquest			1
the @entity234 defence was exposed with worrying regularity , they were caught off - guard by their rivals ’ intensity after half - time and perhaps the biggest concern for @entity180 was that , among so many established test figures , there were none of them who could arrest the slide from dominance to defeat			1
@entity56 ’s first - minute penalty had set the hosts on their way and in the early stages , there was a sense of strong @entity234 conviction and @entity152 jitters , and the one - way pressure kept building			1
sure enough , the first try went to @entity37			2
the @entity1 pack delivered a strong shove at a scrum in their own 22 , but their efforts were to no avail			1
@entity71 picked up and managed to hold off @entity93 , then barged past @entity263 before a sensational off - load sent @entity62 darting around @entity204 to score on the right			1
@entity56 converted and the gap was up to double figures in the eighth minute			2
@entity125 ’s men needed to gain a foothold and they did so in the 15th minute			0
from a lineout drive , @entity87 and @entity270 probed for gaps before the ball was flung right			0
@entity86 passed on to @entity84 and the full - back ’s clever kick through created the opening for @entity85 , who pounced to touch down			1
unfortunately for @entity1 though , fly - half @entity263 's conversion struck the post meaning the score was 10 - 5 in @entity37 ' favour the hosts extended their lead further when @entity56 converted his second penalty of the match in the first half @entity56 's accuracy off - the - tee went awol though minutes later when he missed his first penalty of the match @entity290 ( left ) is taken off the field by @entity37 team doctor @entity58 before later returning @entity60 ( bottom ) is inadvertently kicked in the face by @entity1 second row @entity91 on friday the @entity37 wing appeared to be knocked out twice during his side 's 21 - 16 @entity10 loss against @entity1 @entity87 found his radar at the second attempt , as the @entity147 fly - half slotted home a penalty to reduce the score to 13 - 8 @entity37 fly - half @entity61 ( second left ) soon restored their eight point advantage executing a drop goal on the stroke of half - time @entity263 missed the conversion but was on target with another penalty			1
at the other end , as a disjointed contest became a stop - start kicking duel , @entity56 landed his next penalty shot but missed another routine chance , before @entity61 ’s drop goal sent @entity37 into half - time in good heart			1
their positive mood was shattered four minutes into the second half , as @entity1 hit back with a try which was a triumph for patient pressure and sustained force			1
the forwards softened up the @entity234 defence on the left with a series of close - range drives , as the likes of @entity335 , @entity24 and the impressive @entity93 made their presence felt			0
when the ball was shifted in - field , @entity87 maintained the momentum and @entity32 took a pass with several defenders in close attendance			1
however , the recalled @entity147 centre stepped around @entity61 , shaped to release an over-head off - load and instead twisted past the flailing @entity290 and broke away to score			1
it was just the sort of spark of creativity he had been selected for and the conversion by his club - mate , @entity87 , left the visitors just a point behind			0
just after the hour , the @entity1 no 10 added another penalty to put his side ahead for the first time and it was a deserved revival			1
@entity93 came close to scoring late on and @entity91 went over five minutes from time , but his ‘ try ’ was ruled out for obstruction by replacement @entity360 earlier in the move			0
ultimately , that decision was not decisive , as @entity87 held his nerve with a 79th - minute penalty to cap the comeback			0
@entity1 ’s players lingered for a lap of honour after the final whistle and @entity117 stopped to pose for pictures with delirious visiting supporters as he headed down the tunnel			2
it was that sort of night			0
@entity93 ( centre ) was denied a try during @entity1 's 21 - 16 victory over @entity37 on friday night @entity93 ( with the blue scrum cap ) is tackled by @entity37 ' @entity71 into the post protector in @entity3 @entity93 ( blue scrum cap ) bounced back off the post protector at the @entity41 on friday @entity37 wing @entity57 ( left ) was sin binned in the second half for deliberately knocking - on during @entity1 's attack with @entity93 @entity87 completed the scoreline with two late penalties as @entity1 wrapped up a 21 - 16 win against @entity10 rivals @entity1 players celebrate at the full - time whistle as they record a memorable victory against @entity37 in the @entity10 the players celebrations were matched by head coach @entity117 's ( centre ) and his backroom team in the stands in contrast , the @entity37 players look dejected after failing to score a single point against @entity1 in the second half			1

@entity1 responded through wing @entity85 's first international try halfway through the first half
