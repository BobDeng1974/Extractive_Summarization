@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has told fans dismayed over the imminent £ 20million move to the @entity4 to ' throw eggs at him ' rather than vent their anger at the players			1
sunday 's @entity10 clash with @entity11 at @entity12 is the first opportunity supporters will have to protest publicly against the decision to relocate to @entity15			1
wasps are prepared for ' all possibilities ' as they await the fans ' reaction , noting the outrage evident on @entity23 , internet forums and blogs has been offset by the lack of complaint made directly to the club			2
@entity1 ' @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor @entity32 have only recently returned to the @entity4 after a year away ' what i 'd say to the fans is , the players did n't make the decision , i made the decision , ' @entity0 said			1
' if there is any adverse reaction , you 're just damaging the team because on sunday we 're playing what is probably the best side in the country in @entity11			0
' so get behind the team and if you want to come and throw eggs at me at the fans ' forum , then throw eggs at me			1
but the players are the wrong people to go after			2
' @entity0 attended the first of two forums for @entity1 ' 2,700 season ticket holders on thursday night with around 400 making it to the event in @entity59			1
it was explained that the club was losing £ 3m per year , was being kept afloat by a £ 10m outlay from owner @entity63 and had been one minute away from administration in january 2013			0
the two main complaints have been the absence of consultation with fans and the location of the new home away from @entity1 ' traditional roots in @entity72 and the south - east			2
@entity1 chief executive urges angry fans to ' throw eggs ' at him instead of the players due to the relocation wasps are moving away from @entity12 , located in @entity80 , to further their ambitions as a club @entity0 insists the confidentiality of negotiations made communication with fans impossible and that all options in the search for a site in and around the @entity90 had been exhausted			1
' it 's a heart and heads thing , we absolutely understand that , ' @entity0 said			2
' that 's what being a fan is about - following sport is a completely irrational thing based on emotion as much as logic			0
' once the emotion has played out and logic starts to take over , people will start to understand why we 're doing this			0
' there were two options - we do this or go bust at some point in the future			0
those at the forum understood that			0
' there were some angry voices , but people were prepared to listen			0
' not everyone will come with us , but it would be good if we could take 2,000 of our season ticket holders to the @entity122			1
' @entity1 will decide in the next couple of days when they will make their @entity4 debut , with @entity125 and @entity126 in mid-december the options			1
@entity28 ( right ) speaks to press during the announcement of @entity129 as the new club sponsors			0

@entity1 will relocate to @entity15 's @entity4 in december this year
