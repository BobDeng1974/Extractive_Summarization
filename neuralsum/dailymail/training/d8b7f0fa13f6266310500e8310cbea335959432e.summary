i had mixed emotions at the end of @entity4 ’ victory over @entity5 on sunday			1
the main feeling was one of disappointment that @entity9 did n’t gain the bonus point after failing to get over the line for a fourth try			1
but it just proves how far the side have progressed that a convincing win over a top @entity17 side is regarded as a disappointment			1
they dominated large parts of the game and really should have got the bonus point - but maybe not by the way they went about it			1
game management is vital ; it is what all stand - offs need to be good at as it falls to them to ensure their team plays in the right areas of the pitch			2
@entity4 ' @entity33 jumps into the air to celebrate his hat - trick try against @entity5 @entity36 touches down his third try during @entity9 's 21 - 10 victory on sunday but game management comes from the leadership within the team , too , and this is where i felt @entity9 got things wrong in the first half			1
everyone knew they needed to win the game by scoring four tries to give themselves a better chance of qualifying for the quarter - finals - and the intent was there at the start of the game			2
it worked initially as they got the first try after 12 minutes but it was what happened next that was the problem			0
they squandered many kicks at goal , choosing to kick to touch and try to get more tries , but they just did n’t come			0
it is a nightmare scenario for @entity67 as captain because , once you have made the decision to go for the tries , and they do n’t come , what do you do next ? keep going or revert to kicking the points ? @entity9 kept going but their accuracy and execution let them down			2
in ideal conditions for throwing in , the lineout malfunctioned , which did n’t provide any platform			0
@entity36 ( second right ) is congratulated by team - mates after touching down his hat - trick try the irony is that last week against the @entity87 , with a howling crosswind , the lineouts were impeccable			1
that made yesterday ’s display more surprising			0
when you chase the tries early , well before the game is actually won , it changes not just the tactics used but also the mindset of the team			0
this may be one of the reasons that the lineout did n’t function properly ; they were thinking about how they were going to score before they had secured the ball first			0
the reality is that if they had scored one more try before half - time , everyone would have been happy but they did n’t and these are the fine margins that you need to deal with at this level			0
@entity113 of @entity4 wins a lineout against @entity5 at @entity115 on sunday @entity9 scored the third try with 10 minutes to go , so they had a chance to make it a successful day all round but they just could not find that spark to get the all - important fourth			1
bonus points are key to qualifying for the knockout stages and , especially in the early rounds , you do n’t know how important they will be if you miss one until you get down to the business end of the process			0
they will definitely have to beat @entity130 at the @entity131 and , depending on other results , they might now need to win with four tries - much harder			2
@entity134 of @entity5 ( centre ) tries to evade @entity9 prop @entity136 ( second right ) they might also have to do this without their captain and talisman @entity67 , who was stretchered off on sunday and it did n’t look good			1
meanwhile , @entity143 missed a golden opportunity to qualify for the knockout stage of the @entity146 with one game to spare when they narrowly lost to @entity149 in @entity17			0
all is not lost as , if they beat @entity152 next week at @entity153 , they will top the group and be in the quarter - finals			2
@entity143 have shown huge improvement over the last month or so and i expect them to win that game next week			0
@entity5 scrum - half @entity160 ( centre ) runs straight into a tackle at @entity115 on sunday			1

@entity4 beat @entity5 21 - 10 in @entity165 on sunday
a hat - trick from @entity33 *helped* @entity9 to victory
but their failure to score a bonus - point try was disappointing
it shows just how far this side has progressed that it was disappointing
