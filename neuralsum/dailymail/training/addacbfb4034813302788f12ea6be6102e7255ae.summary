the survey asked more than 2,000 people to reveal the month in which they had the most sex and sunny august came out on top			1
it took the title with 18 per cent of the vote , while february brought up the rear with just two per cent - in spite of @entity17			1
sunshine : according to the poll , sunnier days equal more sex for most couples - particularly in august after august , the most popular months for lovemaking were the equally balmy july and june , with 14 and 10 per cent of the vote each			1
beautiful may came next with six per cent , surprisingly followed by the chilly month of december on five per cent , which would suggest that there 's more than one way to get into the @entity28 spirit			1
by contrast , the remaining autumn and winter months were considered the least sexy by respondents , with february proving least popular , followed by november , january , march and october			1
spring months did better , with april appearing in seventh position , just behind september in sixth			2
researchers put the results down to the higher melatonin levels seen in most of us during the winter months , which can lead to a lower sex drive , depression and lethargy			0
similarly , tests have shown that men have 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through their bodies in june than in january			2
timing : sex is less likely to appeal during the colder months ( left ) but the sap starts to rise come @entity47 since men with more testosterone have more orgasms , more sun spells more and better sex			0
the findings were also backed up by a study conducted by scientists at the @entity56 in @entity57 which found that people are more likely to flirt when the sun is out			0
according to researchers , girls were more likely to give their phone number out when approached by an attractive male when the weather was good rather than overcast			0
a spokesman for sex toy website @entity66 which conducted the survey , said : ' we have just had the bleakest winter in history , but now the sun is out and we are all feeling frisky			0
' the sun shining changes everyone 's moods and , of course , means we are wearing far few clothes			0
' it 's much easier to flirt and have fun when the weather is warm - and that means are lot more of us are getting it on			0
' august july june may december september february november january march october april			1
