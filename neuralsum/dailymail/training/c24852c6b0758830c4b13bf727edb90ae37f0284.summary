by @entity0 @entity1 has booked his place in the @entity4 team at this year 's @entity5 after winning the @entity6 by two shots			1
the @entity8 held off the challenge of his countryman @entity10 to scoop the 166,660 euros ( £ 128,000 ) prize money and qualify via the @entity4 list			1
the 38 - year - old hit six birdies and carded a four - under - par 68 to reverse a two - shot deficit behind @entity10 after a third - round 71 saw him slip behind after leading following the first two days at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
@entity18 ambition : @entity1 qualifies for the @entity20 team after his @entity22 win at the start of the week he needed 30,000 euros ( £ 24,000 ) from the @entity16 tournament and next week 's @entity25 to ensure he tees off at @entity26 without fighting a host of other names for qualification from the world points list			2
@entity1 was in a strong position to do that anyway and occupied the eighth of nine automatic spots , but his victory in the @entity36 means he no longer has to worry about @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 breathing down his neck			2
" this is big - it 's been an amazing week , " he told the @entity43 website			0
determined : @entity1 hit three back - to - back birdies to start his final day round helping him secure victory " i needed to play well either this week or next week , or both , to guarantee my place in the @entity48 so there was a lot on the line and this week i played really well , so that 's great			1
" @entity1 hit three back - to - back birdies to start his round in style and picked up a further shot , with bogeys on the fourth and 17th holes , to nudge him to 14 under overall and past @entity10 , who could only manage a par 72 after dropping shots on the third and 17th holes			1
the victory is @entity1 's third @entity43 title and he savoured the moment afterwards , adding : " winning is everything : wins shoot you up world rankings , race to @entity71 , all sorts			2
it 's massive - those three last holes coming in there were really tough with the wind blowing , so i 'm just really happy to seal it			0
" it 's so difficult to get into the team , the lads are playing so well			0
you know that you have to play well to secure your place and it did come down to the wire			0
but that 's how it is to get into the team - i played as well as i can play for 18 months , and then a couple of slow events and you rocket down the list , so it 's great to come here and play so well and do enough to get into the team			0
" @entity10 finished one ahead of @entity95 and @entity96 to be a runner - up for the second time in as many weeks , but the 41 - year - old is not too disheartened and congratulated @entity1			1
belly up : @entity1 's win here was his third @entity43 title and he will now shoot up the world rankings " i was trying to keep the pressure on and try to force the other guys into mistakes , but to be fair to @entity1 he played great and i 'm pleased he 's secured his place in the @entity5 , " he said			2
@entity40 , meanwhile , finished in a share of seventh on seven under and the @entity112 still needs a good performance in @entity114 to book his own place on @entity117 's team at the @entity5			0
he said : " the week went pretty well - bit disappointed with today , i did n't really play that well , " said @entity40 , " but top ten if you 're not firing is quite good			0

@entity1 won the @entity121 by two shots
he scooped £ 128,000 in prize money for winning the event
the 38 - year - old hit six *bridges* and carded four under on the final day
