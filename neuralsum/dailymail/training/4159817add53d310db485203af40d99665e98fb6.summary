' i chose it for the high foot traffic and the amount of hiding places , ' he said			2
' maybe i should be somewhere more relevant , like @entity24 or @entity25 , but the pizza is n't as good			0

‘ i represent the artist @entity2 , ’ began an email to the @entity15 with the subject line ‘ confidential			1
’ the alt weekly received the message in september from @entity56 art publicist @entity55			0
@entity55 would be the facilitator between @entity15 and @entity2 , who keeps his identity hidden in part because of the illegal nature of his work			1
private : unlike in his 2010 documentary @entity63 ( pictured ) , the @entity15 had no sit down interview with the artist			1
they conversed only through email tongue in cheek : @entity2 is creating a work per day on the streets of @entity6			0
pictured is his piece from october 8 most recently , that illegal work includes better out than @entity76 : an artist residency on the @entity78			1
the month long project began posting photographic evidence of @entity2 ’s work on the website @entity83 starting october 1			1
‘ the plan is to live here , react to things , see the sights — and paint on them , ’ @entity2 told the @entity15 in an email			1
‘ some of it will be pretty elaborate , and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall			0
’ starting october 1 , @entity2 has used his masterful stenciling technique to turn @entity6 buildings into his canvas			2
naughty paperboys , a dog peeing on a fire hydrant , and a @entity98 covered balloon now decorate @entity101 and @entity102 , or did until they were quickly painted over			0
popular : @entity2 signature humor is right at home on the streets of @entity6 and his graffiti has attracted a swarm of media attention rumors : @entity2 addressed questions surrounding his pieces and quashed rumors that he , himself , destroys his work after the fact			0
pictured is a piece from october 2 in @entity101 @entity120 : @entity2 says he must remain anonymous because of the illegal nature of his art. here , @entity2 's signature stenciling can be seen on a @entity101 wall from october 1 there was also an attempt to turn the impatient graffiti of other spray painters into @entity130 gold simply by stenciling ‘ @entity134 ’ beneath screeds like ‘ playground mob ’ and ‘ dirty underwear			2
’ in addition to his painted works , @entity2 also created a mobile installation of a garden , complete with rainbow and waterfall , in the back of a delivery truck			0

‘ now i have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it was n't a cynical plan			0
plus it saves money on having to buy canvases			0
’ one of the questions posed to the graffiti artist who 's also sold art to the likes of @entity162 and @entity163 centered on profit : ' does the artist stand to make a profit from his @entity6 residency ? ' ' there 's no way round it — commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist , ' he writes			1
' we 're not supposed to be embraced in that way			0
when you look at how society rewards so many of the wrong people , it 's hard not to view financial reimbursement as a badge of self - serving mediocrity			2
