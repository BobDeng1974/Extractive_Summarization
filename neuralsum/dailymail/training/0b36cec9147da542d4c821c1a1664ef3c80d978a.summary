by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 14:35 est , 27 march 2013 a third member of the @entity3 special forces unit that raided @entity6 's @entity5 compound has come forward to tell his story - with yet another version of how the @entity10 chief met his end			1
the previous account , given by a @entity13 only identified as @entity14 in @entity15 , claimed he had confronted @entity6 in the terror chief 's bedroom and shot him twice in the forehead when he saw him reach for a gun			1
but now a third member of @entity21 who says he came face to face with @entity6 in the @entity25 figurehead 's final moments has spoken out to say details of @entity15 's scoop are ' complete @entity28 '			1
who killed @entity6 ? an undated picture of the @entity25 figurehead in @entity32			2
a third @entity13 has come forward to rubbish the account of his death published in @entity3 @entity15 last month the latest leak comes after one @entity13 published a book last year about his role in the @entity41 raid and a second spoke to @entity15 for a 15,000 word article published last month			1
the men 's magazine in february published a lengthy profile of ' @entity48 ' , whom they identified only as ' the shooter '			1
@entity14 told @entity15 that on the fateful night he had confronted @entity6 in the terror chief 's bedroom and shot him twice in the forehead when he saw him reach for a gun			1
that account completely contradicted that given by @entity56 , another @entity21 member , in his best - selling book @entity56 , which was written under the pseudonym @entity59			1
now a third member of the secretive military unit has broken cover to tell @entity64 security analyst @entity63 that the story presented in @entity15 is rubbish			1
no easy day : the @entity15 account wildly contradicted that given by @entity56 in this pseudonymously written book published last year it is unclear whether he had official authorisation to speak to the media			1
just after midnight on the morning of may 2 , 2011 , 23 commandos and their interpreter attacked @entity6 's compound			2
they shot and killed his two bodyguards , one of his sons and the wife of one bodyguard			2
the first three soldiers to reach the top floor of the house , where @entity6 's bedroom was believed to be , were ' the point man ' , ' the shooter ' whom @entity15 profiled , and the now - famous @entity88			1
so far all three accounts are in agreement			2
@entity14 told @entity15 that what happened next was that @entity6 peered through his bedroom door and the point man shot at and either missed or lightly wounded him , before peeling off to tackle two women nearby			1
the shooter claims he then ran alone into the room where he found @entity6 hiding behind one of his wives , perhaps using her as a human shield			1
seeing a gun ' within reach ' he shot the @entity25 twice in the head			0
but according to the latest account to emerge , the story is far less heroic			1
@entity63 reports that what actually happened , according to his source , is that the point man shot and gravely wounded @entity6			1
the point man then leapt on the two nearby women - to absorb any explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests - as two more seals went into @entity6 's bedroom and , seeing he was mortally wounded , finished him off			1
the account is largely in agreement with that given in @entity56 , where @entity88 says he was one of the first in the room , saw @entity6 close to death , then finished him off as he lay on the floor			1
the source who spoke to @entity63 told him there was no way @entity14 could have seen a gun in @entity6 's possession because the guns found in the room were only discovered on a high shelf after a thorough search			1
@entity5 police stand guard as workers demolish @entity6 's compound : with the scene of the raid torn down there is now no way to forensically investigate which of the various accounts is actually true pouring more scorn on the @entity15 account , the source further told @entity64 that the shooter was actually sacked from the @entity13 unit in question after bragging about his role in the raid in bars			1
that contradicted claims in the @entity15 article which had cast their source as a humble , retired soldier now struggling to make ends meet after leaving the military while dealing with the physical and psychological scars of the event			1
rumours had already been circulating that @entity15 had been fooled by their source			1
@entity160 points to a post by military blogger @entity162 , a former @entity13 himself , who cited anonymous seal commandos to claim @entity15 had been duped			1
in his post , @entity162 repeated the claim that @entity14 had lost his place on the seal team for his bar - room bragging			2
the @entity13 insignia : members of the secretive unit are supposedly bound by oaths of silence @entity15 , nevertheless , have stood by their story , which is closer to the official account given by @entity3 authorities than either of the accounts given by @entity64 or @entity88			1
@entity63 himself admitted in his @entity64 piece that , with the compound 's buildings now demolished , there is no way to conduct a forensic examination to determine which account is the truth			2
this morning @entity189 , the magazine 's editor - in - chief , posted a strident denial that his contributor had got his facts wrong			1
it reads : ' @entity15 and @entity196 , the veteran journalist and writer of the story , object to @entity64 's report in the strongest possible terms			1
' by stark contrast with @entity196 's thoroughgoing 15,000 word report , the @entity64 story constitutes a mere act of assertion			2
' as far as can be gleaned from the report , it is based on the opinion of one current seal who was not on the @entity6 mission and who therefore could not have first - hand knowledge of it			2
' it is little more than gossip			0
' @entity15 's story remains the most thoroughly reported account of the raid and of the death of @entity6			1
' the @entity13 cautiously approached the room where they found two women , hysterically crying and standing over a man lying at the foot of a bed			1
the younger of the two women rushed at the point man who grabbed them both and herded them into a corner			0
@entity59 comments that had the women been wearing suicide vests , this action would have cost the soldier his life but saved those of his colleagues			0
according to @entity56 , the fallen man , wearing a white sleeveless t - shirt , tan trousers and a tan tunic , had been shot in the right side of his head			2
‘ blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull , ’ writes @entity59			0
‘ in his death throes , he was still twitching and convulsing			0
’ @entity59 and another @entity250 shot more rounds into his chest until he was motionless			0
at least three children sat stunned in the corner of the room as the commandos cleared two small rooms just off the bedrooms			0
other seal teams cleared the rest of the third level until it was declared secure			0
@entity59 and his comrades then examined the body			0
he says : ‘ the man ’s face was mangled from at least one bullet wound and covered in blood			0
a hole in his forehead collapsed the right side of his skull			0
' his chest was torn up from where the bullets had entered his body			0
' he was lying in an ever - growing pool of blood			2
as i crouched down to take a closer look , @entity277 joined me			0
‘ “ i think this is our boy , ” @entity277 said			0
’ in the account given to @entity15 journalist @entity196 the seal recalls that once he locked eyes on his target , he remembers being surprised at his appearance			1
@entity6 was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys , and skinny with a short beard and shaved head			2
he was holding his wife @entity291 in front of him as a shield and though the shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles , @entity6 was in total darkness and could hear but not see			2
' i 'm just looking at him from right here [ he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches ]			0
he 's got a gun on a shelf right there , the short @entity304 he 's famous for			0
and he 's moving forward			0
i do n't know if she 's got a vest and she 's being pushed to martyr them both			0
he 's got a gun within reach			0
i need to get a head shot so he wo n't have a chance to clack himself off [ blow himself up ]			0
' in that second , i shot him , two times in the forehead			0
bap ! bap ! the second time as he 's going down			0
he crumpled on to the floor in front of his bed and i hit him again , @entity322 ! same place			0
' that time i used my @entity325 red - dot holo sight			2
i watched him take his last breaths , just a reflex breath			0
' and i remember as i watched him breathe out the last part of air , i thought : is this the best thing i 've ever done , or the worst thing i 've ever done ? this is real and that 's him			0
' his forehead was gruesome			0
it was split open in the shape of a @entity344 i could see his brains spilling out over his face			0

latest leak contradicts account given in recent @entity15 article
@entity13 source says that story of the shooter is ' complete @entity28 '
@entity15 editor - in - chief says : ' we stand by our story '
