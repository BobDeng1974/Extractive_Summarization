the bone is thought to confer strength on the person taking it and monkeys are n't the only animal to end up in the market			0
sharing the shelves with primates are shrunken heads that once belonged to dogs , donkeys , hyenas and even leopards			0
other beasts turned into voodoo medicine and hawked by vendors include elephants , hippos , antelopes , whales and living eagles , although for the birds at least , an appearance at the market is n't the end of the road			1
' the living hawks are not sacrificed , ' reveals @entity27			0
' someone who is possessed by an evil spirit will buy the hawk , have a voodoo priest transfer the black spirit to the unknowing hawk , and then let the hawk go free			0
he also has a recipe for a voodoo love potion			2

' despite the risk of falling foul of anti-trafficking laws , vendors have been selling fetishes at the @entity7 market for at least 40 years , although locals claim that sales have been going on for more than a century			2
voodoo too has long been a popular part of life in @entity6 , which although more commonly associated with @entity149 , originated in @entity150 and is the official state religion in neighbouring @entity152			1
the cures associated with the religion are much in demand at the market according to @entity27 , with shoppers willing to pay as much as £ 200 for a dried out hyena head or £ 80 for a bracelet made from elephant tail bones			1

like the better known @entity149 voudou , the religion centres on spirit worship ; whether powerful deities that control forces of nature or humble presences that inhabit rivers , trees and rocks			0
@entity6 voodoo worshippers also pray to their ancestors and believe that the spirits of the dead walk side by side with the living , and can be asked to intercede for them with @entity228 or @entity229 - the mother goddess who occupies the most important place in the vodun pantheon			2
worship is led by women , with each family clan headed by a matriarch who leads prayers on behalf of the clan			0
although they take a lead role in rituals , they are not priestesses ; a term used solely for women who belong to each clan 's spiritual ' convent '			0
talismans such as the fetishes pictured , are thought to contain some of the divine power that adherents believe suffuses every living being on the planet , and can confer healing on the people who use it			0
