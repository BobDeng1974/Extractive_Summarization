a woman has launched an online petition asking @entity2 to give its employees @entity4 off so that her mother can spend the holiday at home with her family			1
after the company announced plans to keep its stores open for 42 hours straight , from 6am on @entity4 straight through until midnight on @entity12 , @entity13 , 25 , called for the retailer to give its employees – including her mother – a chance to spend at least some of the holiday with their families			1
' we understand that it is retail , and employees understand that they have to work hours on holidays			0
however , @entity2 ’s unnecessary hours are forcing its employees to miss out on important time with their families , ' wrote ms @entity13 , who lives in @entity23 , @entity24			1
controversy : one daughter has launched a petition asking @entity2 to give employees time off on @entity4 , so that her mother wo n't have to spend the holiday working			1
an employee at a @entity30 @entity2 is shown on @entity12 three years ago ' with lives that are continuously busier and busier , it is more important now than ever to put an end to this before we no longer have holidays			2
' since posting the petition wednesday night , she has already garnered 1,250 out of the 2,000 signatures she 's seeking			0
ms @entity13 told @entity41 that , while she has not yet received a response from @entity2 , ' the response from @entity2 employees has been very positive			1
' ' employees , as well as non-employees , are expressing that it is enough that we have @entity12 , and it should n't ruin the time we have with our families on @entity4			1
' speaking to @entity52 , ms @entity13 added that her mother , who has worked for the retail giant for 21 years , has n't even been told whether she 'll be required to work on the holiday this year , but revealed that last year ’s @entity4 sales saw her working not one , but two separate shifts at her local store			2
' she was not going to be able to spend any real time with our family			0
to hear her on the verge of tears really infuriated me , to think why are they doing this to people , they need time to be with their families , ' she recalls			0
' this is the one holiday where the whole family gets together : her mother ’s brothers , sisters , nephews , nieces			0
@entity4 is pretty much the one time of year we all get together			0
' ms @entity13 ’s petition has already received support from a number of current and former @entity2 employees , many of whom share her anger and frustration			1
' i used to work at @entity2 , and missed many holidays with my family			0
it is not volunteer work , it is required			0
they are ridiculous and should be ashamed at themselves for trying to make money on @entity4 ! let people be with their families ! ' wrote @entity96 although @entity12 is generally regarded as the biggest date on @entity99 's shopping calendar , recent years have seen other stores begin their sales on thursday night			1
@entity102 's and @entity103 ’s have previously led the way for promotions to start early - opening on @entity4 rather than @entity12			2
however , some leading retailers have announced that they will not open on @entity4 amid anger that traditional time at home is being lost to shopping			2
a facebook page called @entity112 on @entity4 and various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the holiday , and stores such as @entity116 and @entity117 will now close so that staff can enjoy the day with family .			0

last week @entity2 announced that its stores would *remain* open for 42 hours straight over @entity4 and @entity12
@entity13 , 25 , has launched an online petition asking the retailer to give employees more time off
