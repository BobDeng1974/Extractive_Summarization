the @entity1 government remains tight - lipped over the naming of @entity3 ( pictured , who was revealed today as @entity4 , 26 , from west @entity5 questions were being asked today about why it was left to the @entity9 government to reveal the identity of @entity3 instead of @entity1 authorities			1
the @entity1 government remains tight - lipped over the naming of the terror suspect who was revealed today as 26 - year - old @entity4 , from @entity15 in west @entity5			1
@entity4 , who studied computer programming at the @entity17 before travelling to the @entity18 three years ago , was confirmed as the prominent @entity20 figure by two @entity0 sources			1
however , while @entity24 sources confirmed @entity4 had been known to security services for several weeks , the @entity22 would not release any confirmation of his identity			1
government sources said his name had not been made public because the priority was to try and locate him			0
the @entity22 said it was ' unable to comment ' when contacted by @entity31 today , while @entity32 has yet to respond to requests for comment			0
@entity35 also refused to comment on @entity36 , including claims that he had contacts with @entity40			0
a number 10 spokesman said : ' our long - standing position on @entity3 's identity is that we are neither confirming nor denying			2
' there is an ongoing police investigation , we are not going to give a running commentary on that			0
' pressed on the claims @entity4 had contact with @entity40 , the spokesman said : ' you are asking me to speculate about speculation			0
' what 's right is we let the police and security services do their work in an ongoing investigation to bring these murderers to justice			0
' police could be seen attending @entity4 's home in @entity15 earlier today , but no officers spoke to the media			2
despite official sources failing to confirm his identity , it is understood @entity70 - the brother of @entity1 aid worker @entity71 who was beheaded by @entity3 - was aware of the @entity20 militant 's identity			1
it is also believed that he was made aware by @entity0 officials that the name would released to the public today			2
jihadi @entity3 's identity was first published by the @entity78 , who reported that friends and family of @entity82 had confirmed he was the @entity20 frontman			1
the revelation was swiftly picked up by the @entity1 media , but despite being broadcast around the world , @entity1 authorities continue to remain tight - lipped			1
police attended his home today ( pictured ) @entity93 , a senior research fellow at defence think tank the @entity95 , said it was no surprise that @entity3 's outing was revealed by @entity9			2
he said : ' it will elevate him , and even add to the mythology around him in some minds			0
' he has been on the radar for a long time now , and we finally know who he is			0
' there is a reason the @entity1 security services would not have wanted his name to be made public , because they will have been watching his associates covertly as part of their intelligence gathering			0
' the @entity113 said last year they knew who @entity3 was , but my understanding is he had actually been narrowed down to one of three people , and the @entity1 and @entity9 were not sure which			1
' that is an example of the different attitude when it comes to revealing information			0
' @entity3 has featured in the execution videos of @entity1 aid workers @entity124 and @entity126 , @entity9 journalists @entity127 and @entity129 , @entity131 reporter @entity130 and @entity133 soldiers			1
both @entity1 and @entity9 authorities have maintained that they have been running a joint investigation to unmask the @entity20 militant			1
however , while the @entity1 government has largely remained tight - lipped about the probe , @entity9 officials have been more vocal			1
the @entity140 has also previously offered a Â£ 6million reward to anyone providing information that could lead to the capture of @entity3			0
last september , @entity9 sources revealed that @entity9 spy planes had flown above @entity1 to monitor telephone and computer signals in a bid to track down the @entity1 terrorist and those communicating with him			2
the aircraft , manned by @entity1 pilots and carrying @entity113 agents , were equipped with advanced technology to detect heat coming off a keyboard when a button was pressed			0
at the time , the @entity9 claimed that @entity3 was from a suburb within 10 miles of south @entity5 , but defence secretary @entity160 said that @entity1 officials were only ' getting warm ' as to confirming his identity			1
however , in the same month - perhaps reinstating the fact it was a joint investigation between the two countries - it emerged that family members of @entity3 had been interviewed by both @entity32 officers and an @entity113 agent .			2
