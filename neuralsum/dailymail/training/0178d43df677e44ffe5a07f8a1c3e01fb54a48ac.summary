by @entity0 published : 03:24 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 21 october 2013 infuriated customers : @entity3 boss @entity2 told residents facing £ 1,500 bill to ' just use less ' millions of families are facing annual gas and electricity bills of more than £ 1,500 for the first time after a price hike by energy giant @entity3			1
the @entity12 - owned supplier was accused of putting ‘ profits before people ’s lives ’ after it announced the average dual fuel bill would rise by 10.4 per cent to an average of £ 1,491 per year			1
the hike means customers in four regions – @entity22 , @entity23 , the @entity24 and parts of @entity26 – will see their average bills top £ 1,500 a year , an all - time high			2
@entity3 – which was accused by @entity30 earlier this year of dodging tax – insisted the government ’s green taxes were largely to blame for the increase			1
but it did admit it wanted to increase its own profit margins – to 5p in the pound			1
@entity3 is the latest energy giant to raise prices , after @entity40 announced a 9.2 per cent rise last week , and @entity42 an 8.2 per cent hike a week earlier			1
yesterday the firm ’s chief executive @entity2 further infuriated customers when , in a video posted on @entity46 , he defended the price hike			0
in it he pointed out : ‘ it may be a cliche but it ’s true : the cheapest unit of energy is always the one that is n’t used			1
’ he meant householders can protect themselves against rising tariffs by installing double glazing or loft insulation			1
but he was accused of patronising his customers – many of whom pointed out that they were already rationing their heat			0
mr @entity2 ’s personal @entity65 feed is blocked to non-approved followers , but that did not stop people using the social media site to criticise him			0
one angry customer described his @entity46 performace as ‘ vomit inducing ’			1
earlier this year , mps reacted with fury at mr @entity2 ’s defence of @entity3 ’s failure to pay corporation tax			0
in evidence to @entity79 select ommittee , he admitted the firm paid no corporation tax in the three years 2009 , 2010 and 2011 – despite making £ 750million over the period			0
he insisted it was legal and even desirable because it meant the firm could spend more money on ‘ keeping the lights on ’			0
yesterday , @entity3 again defended its profit of about £ 64 per customer a year as ‘ reasonable ’			0
’ @entity3 tried to shift the blame for higher energy bills by pointing to green taxes and eco schemes imposed by the government , the cost of running the national grid of pipes and wires , as well as ‘ the actual cost of buying energy ’			1
but the wholesale price of gas – which makes up half of the bill – is up just three per cent compared with a year ago , which would only put up bills by 1.5per cent			2
in the video mr @entity2 said : ‘ this has been a really hard decision for us			0
’ how bills have soared : @entity40 dual fuel energy bills have soared from £ 1,100 in 2010 to around £ 1,465 after the latest round of price hikes			1
graph provided by @entity133 in a blog , he added : ‘ i know people think energy companies are raking in huge profits at the expense of customers , but this simply is n’t the case			2
’ the official customer body , @entity143 , called for two inquiries to establish whether the public are being ripped off – one into the structure of the market and a second into green taxes			0
energy secretary @entity150 repeated the official government line that power price rises are ‘ disappointing ’ and urged consumers to shop around			1
@entity154 of the @entity155 said : ‘ we need to acknowledge the problem is the @entity158 themselves : they will never priortise people ’s lives over their profits			0
’ energy bills and on the way up - but you could save up to £ 300 by switching			2
providers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs , so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			2
but suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who live in their ' home ' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation			1
so switching away will almost always save you money			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			2
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

electricity tariffs will rise by *9.3* ****%**** , gas prices by 11.1 ****%**** from december
@entity193 blames rising fuel costs and meeting government schemes
move comes after 9.2 ****%**** rise by @entity40 and 8.2 ****%**** increase by @entity42
@entity201 says he ' understands why households are angry '
@entity204 : ' we *'ve* got a *pm* standing up for energy firms . we need action '
