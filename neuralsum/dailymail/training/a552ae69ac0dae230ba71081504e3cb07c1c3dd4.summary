@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned his players they have gone from hunter to prey since winning the @entity5			1
@entity0 's men head into @entity8 battle with the @entity9 in @entity10 on tuesday evening having surrendered a 33 - game unbeaten running in qualifiers with a 2 - 0 defeat in @entity15 on saturday , a result which followed a friendly loss to @entity18 and a narrow @entity20 victory over @entity21			1
but while the manager insists the weight of success is not a burden for his team , he admits the label does serve to inspire whoever they come up against			0
@entity0 's @entity31 side have posted some average results since their @entity5 victory in @entity34 @entity0 said : ' the difficulties we are experiencing at the moment are of a type that we have experienced many times before			1
but generally speaking , i do n't think the position now is anymore difficult than it 's always been			2
' we used to be the hunter ; now we are the prey			0
we know that teams like @entity21 will play with incredible motivation against us - but that was true even after [ the @entity5 in ] 2010 and [ @entity46 ] 2012			2
' we know the situation , we know how to get by it , but it 's no different now than it used to be			2
' @entity1 remain overwhelming favourites to top the group and will expect to right the wrongs of @entity52 in comprehensive style against an @entity9 team which has collected maximum points from a trip to @entity57 and a 7 - 0 demolition of @entity59			1
@entity0 said : ' if you ask me what is the mood like now , fury is the wrong word , anger is the wrong word			1
but what you can feel is some kind of determination , that we really badly want these three points against @entity9			1
' but there is no incredible disappointment in the team			0
that would be wrong to say			0
' we have seen both the @entity76 games and have analysed them , and we can expect some sort of copy of @entity15			1
there 's nothing new to us			2
the @entity81 are good fighters , they have commitment and fantastic fighting spirit , and they know how to defend			0
' they are a very well organised team , but at the same time , they have excellent players , like @entity86 , who is very experienced and has an eye for goal , @entity89 , @entity90 and other players who come from the wings and are very good at dribbling around their opponents			0
' like @entity15 , they are very fast on the counter , coming from the wings and putting dangerous crosses in			1
' they come to @entity1 with self - confidence and with three teams being able to qualify from this group , they are in with a more than reasonable chance of actually making it to @entity106			1
' @entity108 striker @entity107 is set to be named in @entity0 's starting line - up to face the @entity9 @entity0 insisted he would not make too many changes to his team , although @entity113 midfielder @entity112 will be missing through illness with @entity108 's @entity107 expected to be drafted in on his home ground after himself shaking off a virus			1
@entity107 said : ' we want people to forget the defeat against @entity15			1
as a footballer , you want to win every game			0
' the last thing you do is sit down looking at the table and try to pre-conceive , ' we can afford to lose this one , we can afford to lose that one and still make it '			0
' if you are a professional player , you want to win everything , so we feel we need to prove to our fans we can still win games			0
' we are reigning world champions			0
even if we lost a game , we still are title - holders and we are all fully there			2
we want to show the world that we would like to reach unbeatable status as quickly as possible			0
' @entity0 has cited @entity136 winger @entity89 as one of the @entity9 's main attacking threats much of the concern in @entity1 over the current team surrounds the full - backs with @entity143 's international retirement in particular leaving a gaping hole at the back , and youngsters @entity146 and @entity148 have found themselves under intense scrutiny			1
but @entity0 said : ' @entity143 played in the position for many , many years and he showed world class both on the right and on the left			2
' it was obvious it would be difficult to replace somebody like him on a one - to - one basis			0
