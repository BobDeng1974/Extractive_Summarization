when astronomers first started taking ultraviolet images of @entity3 , they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ‘ y ’ shape that covered the entire planet			1
but now researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a ‘ wave ’ of clouds to produce a stretched effect			2
the discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow - rotating bodies in the solar system			0
scroll down for a video animation showing the effect @entity19 astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on @entity3 ( annotated image from the @entity23 in 1979 shown )			1
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet			1
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape the latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the @entity34 of @entity35 ( @entity36 ) in @entity37 , @entity19 , in collaboration with the university of the @entity40 and the @entity41 of @entity42			1
@entity3 is slightly smaller than @entity43 but has a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million kilometres ) , and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. one day on @entity3 lasts as long as 243 @entity43 days			1
its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen , with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets			0
it 's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable			0
the planet 's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 ° @entity62 ) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it			0
on @entity3 strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph ( 360km/h ) , circling the planet every four to five @entity43 days			1
but the planet itself takes almost 243 @entity43 days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet			1
the winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude , but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller			2
this ultimately gives rise to this ‘ y ’ shape , as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly			2
' this [ atmospheric ] wave is dragged by the winds of @entity3 , so if they are constant the wave should round the planet without getting deformed , right ? ' dr @entity91 , the @entity36 - @entity36 researcher in charge of this study , told @entity99			1
' but we must consider that these waves propagate over a " sphere " , and " circles " completed both at the equator and at @entity105 have a different radius ( the higher latitude , the smaller the parallels or circles are )			0
' so , having the same velocity than that at the equator , anything moving horizontally at 40º will complete the longitude of the circle sooner that when doing the same at the equator			0
' this is why the wave gets deformed			0
the area of the wave at higher latitudes complete circles quicker than at the equator			2
' winds on @entity3 can circle the planet in four to five @entity43 days			1
but the planet takes 243 @entity43 days to rotate , amplifying the y shape			1
the effect is also amplified by the winds moving round the planet quicker nearer the poles ( @entity129 10 image from 1974 shown left )			2
an illustration of the surface of @entity3 is shown on the right he added that the idea was not entirely new - but his theory was the first that explained a new type of atmospheric wave , different to anything seen on @entity43			1
using the new type of wave , he said they could predict the vertical structure of the y feature , and show that it was trapped about the altitude where the winds are strongest			0
the shape is defined with dark regions , produced by an unknown compound that absorbs ultraviolet radiation			0
the wave seems to be ' pushing up ' this ultraviolet absorber from below on @entity3 - although what this substance is , which gives the feature its dark appearance , remains a mystery			1
' it has been a mystery for decades			0
nobody knows for sure , ' added dr @entity91			0
' many candidates have been proposed : hydrobromic acid , amorphous sulfur , disulphur monoxide or even living sources such as bacteria			0
' the strange shape on @entity3 was first spotted by @entity174 's @entity173 spacecraft when it arrived at @entity3 in 1974			2
an illustration of the spacecraft is shown here			0
the new theory could have important implications for other slowly rotating bodies in the solar system as the clouds are pushed through the atmosphere , those either side are dragged behind , giving the whole planet a ‘ stretched ’ appearance when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths			2
when viewed in visible light , the planet simply appears bright yellow or white - as the high amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reflect a lot of sunlight			0
the astronomers have also , for the first time , created a simulation that reproduces the evolution of the shape over the course of a month			0
understanding the shape will allow astronomers to study the ‘ super-rotating ’ nature of the @entity3 atmosphere			1
‘ a wave with the size of the @entity209 must play a key role in explaining why the atmosphere rotates sixty times faster than the surface , so it was crucial to understand it , ’ said dr @entity91 in a release .			1
