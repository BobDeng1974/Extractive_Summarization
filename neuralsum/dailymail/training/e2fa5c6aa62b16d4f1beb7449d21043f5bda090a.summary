a @entity0 in @entity1 is refusing to pay a $ 188,000 bill for removing a whale carcass from a popular beach because ' whales are mammals , not fish			1
' while that is scientifically true , the local council in the @entity9 , @entity1 , insists that because the whale came from the sea , the state 's @entity0 has to pay for its removal			1
the 17 metre carcass washed ashore on @entity17 on november 3 , leaving @entity18 to arrange for special earthmoving equipment to lift the rotting body up and transport it by lorry to a waste facility where it was buried , the @entity15 reported today			1
' i 've asked the @entity34 and the minister for fisheries to arrange for the state government to pick up the bill - but all we 've been offered is $ 8,000 for the waste fees and the cost of the contaminated sand , ' said mr @entity26			1
' the minister for fisheries ' office said they are not going to foot the bill because it 's a mammal , not a fish			1
they believe it 's not in their jurisdiction			2
' mr @entity26 told the @entity15 that that the @entity51 should have arranged to tow the dead whale out to sea before it was washed onto the beach			2
the local council in @entity1 has claimed that the state 's @entity0 has to pay the bill ' we 're not going to pay this and the ratepayers are not going to pay it			1
' we pay the government $ 26.3 million for fire and emergencies services levies and this was an emergency			2
' he insisted that if another whale carcass was washed onto the beach , his council would not handle the clean - up			1
meanwhile a spokeswoman for the minister for fisheries said the @entity74 of 1994 ' does not envisage the @entity75 managing whales , whether they are alive or dead			0
' however the minister for the @entity79 ' office said the carcass was ' not in their jurisdiction ' due to being a mammal , not a fish whales are classified as mammals because , unlike fish , they are warm - blooded and breath air with lungs , taking in oxygen directly when they come to the surface at regular intervals			1
when they surface , they exhale the air they have previously breathed in , puffing it out through ' nostrils ' known as blowholes			0
they give birth to live young and suckle the new - born on milk secreted by mammary glands			0
in addition , they have hair , or rather bristles , usually on their heads			0
science has taught us that whales , along with dolphins , seals and walruses left the land some 55 million years ago and went into the water , where they evolved into today 's creatures			0
it was the same whale that made worldwide news when @entity123 man @entity122 , from @entity124 , climbed on top of it ‘ it was definitely a stupid act but i did n't mean any disrespect to anyone			2
@entity131 thinks i 'm an idiot , and @entity132 is n't too proud either , ' mr @entity122 said the whale in question is the same one that @entity122 , from @entity135 near @entity124 , climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on saturday afternoon			1
he became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale			2
‘ he [ the shark ] was too busy chomping on the whale so it was n't too bad , ' he said			0
the extreme sports enthusiast added his parents were not impressed with his brush with the whale			0
' i ’ve done it , i do n’t need to do it again , ' he said			0
‘ it was definitely a stupid act but i did n't mean any disrespect to anyone			0
@entity131 thinks i 'm an idiot , and @entity132 is n't too proud either			0

the removal of the 17 metre whale carcass cost the local council $ 188,000
@entity1 's @entity9 insists that the state 's @entity0 has to pay the bill
however the minister for the @entity79 ' office said the carcass was ' not in their jurisdiction ' due to being a mammal , not a fish
the whale is the same one that @entity122 climbed on top of after jumping off a boat , despite it being circled by feeding sharks at the time
