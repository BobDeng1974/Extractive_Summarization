by @entity0 testing : a @entity2 customer tests the store 's cherries - some of the first to be grown outside this year everybody wants a bite of the cherry ... but you ’ll need deep pockets to do so – as @entity2 has opened this year ’s season for the fruit by selling them at a juicy £ 1.65 each			1
at the upmarket store in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 paid £ 41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g ( 10.5oz ) and contained just 25 cherries			1
at £ 140 a kilo ( or £ 64/lb ) , industry sources said this was a ‘ record ’ price for early - season cherries			1
the fruit is not available at all until april , when the only supply in the world comes from heated @entity29 greenhouses			0
but the @entity2 cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors			1
@entity32 , the store ’s director of foods , said : ‘ we sell @entity37 @entity36 cherries from a small producer in the @entity39 with a limited number of trees			0
' they grow in the open and are only available for four weeks in the year			0
each cherry is hand - picked at optimal ripeness with direct , same - day distribution into @entity2			1
‘ the producer only supplies @entity2 with this variety			2
as these cherries are very difficult to grow , very few people do			0
because they are so rare , they are expensive			0
’ but even more common varieties of cherry might plunge the average family budget into the red			0
at @entity59 on friday , a 200g ( 7oz ) pack of cherries cost £ 5			2
with 20 cherries in the pack each cherry worked out at 25p			0
a @entity59 spokeswoman said : ‘ it ’s early for the cherry season but demand is outstripping supply and that is why shoppers are having to pay these prices			0
' next week though the season comes into full swing , cherries will be in abundance and prices will come down			0
’ @entity77 cherries will also be on promotion from tomorrow , with a 10oz punnet priced £ 2 – almost 20 times cheaper than @entity2 ’ variety			1
@entity81 me ! our receipt and one of the fabulously expensive cherries from the upmarket @entity14 store last night , @entity16 gave four people blind tests with cherries from five stores ; @entity92 , @entity59 , @entity93 & @entity94 , @entity2 and upmarket organic chain @entity95			2
two of our tasters preferred @entity2 cherries , while two opted for the @entity95 range			1
@entity100 , 25 , a @entity102 living in @entity15 , chose @entity2 as her favourite and @entity92 as least enjoyable			2
‘ i usually buy my cherries from @entity106 ’s but the @entity2 ones are just as good , ’ she said , adding she would expect to pay about £ 6 for a packet			1
when told how much the luxury store was selling its cherries for , she said : ‘ oh , i ’d never pay that , that ’s ridiculous			0
’ @entity113 , 31 , originally from @entity114 but living in the capital , said the ‘ sour and tasteless ’ @entity2 cherries were the worst and @entity95 ‘ the best by far ’ .			1
