by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:26 pm on 10th january 2012 it 's no secret that @entity5 â€™s favourite @entity4 passage is @entity6 , but his performance sunday took those numbers to biblical proportions			1

in addition , the overtime portion of the game , in which @entity5 threw the game - winning 80 - yard pass , scored a 31.6 television rating			1
in the 2009 @entity30 , which he famously led the @entity26 to victory over the @entity28 , the message on his eye black was ' @entity6 '			1
after his graduation , messages on eye black were outlawed for college football players in a ban now known as ' the @entity5 rule '			1
in the @entity44 , such a practice is also against the rules			0
the passage reads : ' for @entity47 so loved the world that he gave his one and only son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life			0
' since breaking into the @entity44 's top ranks this season , @entity5 has made headlines as much for his outspoken religious beliefs as for his performances for the @entity57			1
and his claims to be helped by @entity47 were bolstered when sharp - eyed fans saw a halo floating above the stadium where he helped the @entity57 to a spectacular overtime victory over the @entity63 on sunday			0

divine favour : a halo appeared in the sky above @entity66 while the @entity57 were playing against the @entity63 there on sunday the game ended after the first play of overtime - just 11 seconds in - when the quarterback launched the incredible pass for a touchdown			2
@entity5 's amazing performance in the game cemented the 24 - year - old 's cult status - and the appearance of the halo in the sky above suggested his non-stop invocation of his religion may not have been in vain			2
the divine apparition was snapped by @entity88 , who told the @entity89 he 'd never seen the phenomenon in the area before			0
two season - ticket holders at the stadium said they too thought the vision was unprecedented			0
@entity5 , @entity95 : the unusual position the quarterback takes while praying on the field has inspired an internet craze , with people competing to pray in the most humorous situation celebration : @entity5 's brilliant 80 - yard throw won the game after just 11 seconds of overtime it was not the only divine coincidence surrounding the match , however			1
many commentators noticed that @entity5 threw a total of 316 yards , evoking memories of the @entity4 verse @entity6 , which @entity5 wrote on his eye paint when he was playing for the @entity26 and which surged to the top of @entity116 rankings after his appearance in the 2009 @entity30			1
@entity5 's success with the @entity57 is considered by some to be particularly miraculous as he has masterminded an unusual number of victories from a losing position			2
