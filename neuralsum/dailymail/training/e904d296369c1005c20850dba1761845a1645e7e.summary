@entity0 's has been accused of super-sized tax avoidance after apparently dodging more than £ 700million worth of taxes across @entity3			1
the @entity5 fast food chain funnelled billions of pounds through @entity6 to reduce its tax bill significantly , according to a report			0
@entity6 has controversially been used as a tax haven by many multi-nationals because it allows companies to pay as little as 1 per cent tax on income			0
now , @entity14 has been branded ‘ shameful ’ after claims it used an ‘ aggressive ’ tax loophole to avoid paying around £ 730million over five years			0
appetising : a quarter - pounder from @entity0 's , which has been branded ' shameful ' over accusations it used a @entity6 offshoot to avoid paying about £ 730million to the @entity23 tax man over five years according to @entity23 charity @entity24 – which tackles poverty around the world – @entity0 ’s opened a @entity6 - based offshoot called @entity28 in 2009 , to deal with royalty revenues paid by franchises using its brand			1
this happened ‘ immediately after ’ a policy change in the country which allowed these kinds of intellectual property firms to pay lower taxes on income			0
the company then routed billions in royalties from its @entity3 operations to the @entity6 outpost , minimising its tax liabilities , the report said			2
that same year , @entity0 ’s also shifted its @entity3 headquarters from @entity47 to low - tax @entity48 , which was viewed as another attempt to reduce its liabilities			1
‘ as a result , @entity0 ’s engaged in aggressive and potentially abusive optimisation of its structure which has led to the avoidance of significant amounts of tax , ’ the review said			2
‘ this structure is likely to have cost @entity3 governments over 1billion euros [ £ 727million ] in lost tax revenues between 2009 and 2013			0
’ @entity23 is the third largest @entity3 market for @entity0 ’s after @entity63 and @entity64 , meaning the @entity23 could have lost out on millions of pounds			1
the report found that @entity0 ’s @entity6 branch registered revenues of £ 2.7billion over five years , but paid less than £ 12million of tax			1
if it had kept these royalties in @entity3 as ‘ profit ’ , rather than diverting them through @entity6 , it would have had to pay more than 60 times this amount			2
and if it had kept its headquarters in the @entity23 and paid @entity23 corporation tax on all the royalties it earned from its @entity3 subsidiaries , @entity79 could have netted up to £ 818million extra between 2009 and 2013			1
even if @entity0 ’s had only paid @entity23 corporation tax on the money it made from @entity23 royalties , the taxman would have received £ 75million more			1
@entity14 in @entity85 : @entity23 is the third largest @entity3 market for the @entity5 burger chain while the schemes are not illegal , firms are coming under growing pressure to pay tax in the country they sell their goods – rather than where various headquarters are based			1
@entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 are among the other corporations accused of pushing profits through @entity6 to reduce their tax bill			0
and @entity0 ’s has already faced scrutiny of its tax practices in @entity64 , with authorities visiting its @entity108 office last year			0
@entity111 spokesman @entity110 said the report ‘ will be carefully processed ’ , the @entity109 reported			0
it was co-written by @entity24 alongside three @entity5 and @entity3 trade unions – @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
@entity118 , of @entity119 , said : ‘ it is shameful to see that a multibillion euro company , that pays low wages , still seeks to avoid its responsibility to pay its fair share of much - needed taxes to finance public services we all rely on			0
’ a @entity0 ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity14 complies with applicable laws , including payments of the taxes that are owed in each country in which we operate			2
a significant amount of tax is also paid by our franchisees , who make up 73 per cent of @entity0 ’s restaurant estate in @entity3			1

@entity24 traced @entity0 's finances through the tiny country
it found the firm paid franchise royalties to a @entity6 offshoot
firm also shifted its @entity3 hq from @entity47 to @entity48 , @entity150
@entity23 is the third largest @entity3 market for @entity0 ’s
