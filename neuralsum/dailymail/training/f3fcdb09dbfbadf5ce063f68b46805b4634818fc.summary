by @entity0 for @entity1 a far cry from the relative safety of a modern boxing ring , these stunning photos show the brutal @entity7 sport of @entity8 , and look like something out of @entity10			1
the gloves are well and truly off here - instead , the contestants ' stronger hands are wrapped in hard rope - which in the old days could even be dipped in resin and shards of broken glass			1
that practice is now illegal , but the sport is dangerous enough without it - the aim is to strike your opponent with kicks and punches , trying to make them fall to the floor			1
@entity8 belongs to the @entity66 people			1
it is centuries old , but is still very popular in @entity68 , southern @entity69 and the south west of @entity71			0
the tradition is entrenched among butcher caste groups and is very heavily focussed on communities.the sport started from clans of butchers travelling to different villages at harvest and fighting those from the area as part of the festival entertainment			1
butchers come from a lower caste of @entity66 society - they are the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat			2
they would form teams from the village - known as armies - and challenge men from other butchers guilds , as well locals from the audience			2
stand off : two fighters scout each other out , looking for an opening to make the first move and try and achieve a ' killing ' - the name for a take - down clubbed : two younger fighters battle it out in the sandy arena , as one is caught on the back by a swinging arm , but avoids a killer shot watching on : @entity8 is a very popular spectator sport , and those who come to watch bet on the outcome and chant support or taunts at the fighters chowing down : a fighter is caught in the mouth by a flailing arm but has his opponent on the ropes and falling to the ground with a strong head - shot nowadays , that sense of team is still very strong , and the sport is still dominated by the butchers caste , but competitors will often be very young - teenagers who train in gyms and yards - and will fight all year round			1
fighters join a professional community which travel to fight , often now in temporary rings , rather than just inside a circle of spectators as in the past			2
they fight for prize money - just as they did traditionally - as harvest was a time of wealth			0
they wear shorts , rather than loincloths , and the pre-fight entertainment is more elaborate , and can even use sound systems			0
the fights in these pictures , taken in @entity68 , took place inside a sand - filled arena , which can be found in larger towns and are also used for wrestling championships			2
team spirit : @entity8 is traditionally a sport where fighters travel in teams , challenging people from other villages , and this is still the case today poised to strike : two youngsters , one a left - hander , look to make the first move and get the upper hand in the bout the gloves are off : the fighters do not wear gloves , but instead wrap their stronger hand with rope - which they once could dip in resin and shards of glass @entity8 used to include an element of wrestling , known as @entity175 , but is now essentially about punching and kicking			1
fights last three rounds - though these rounds are not timed - their end is signified either when there is a lull in the action , one of the contestants or an official calls a stop to it , or when someone is knocked down			2
there are no official weight classes , though fighters are normally matched up with someone of a similar size			0
the strapped up strong arm is knows as the ' spear ' , while the front hand is called the ' shield ' - and must be held with the palm open and facing the opponent			1
as well as for protection , the shield can also be used to grab hold of an opponent			0
contestants can also kick with both legs - the lead leg can sometimes be wrapped with a chain and is also used for defence			0
spectators are a key part of the whole event - they create the atmosphere by chanting to support or taunt the competitors , while betting is also prevalent			0
other traditions include the use of amulets for supernatural protection , with some fighters wrapping them to their spear hand , while some of the fighting groups also ritually smoke marijuana before matches			0
time to relax : a fighter spits water into the air and lets it fall back over his face to cool down after a brutal battle			0
