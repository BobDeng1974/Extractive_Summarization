by @entity0 from pus - filled lumps to hard ' granuloma ' and damaged fatty tissue , the perils of having permanent filler are well documented			1
but when a surgeon suggested that @entity8 , a 47 - year - old beauty tutor , have the treatment as a pre-wedding pick - me - up , she went ahead - even though she had originally opted for a safer , non-permanent version			1
now , years after having the treatment , she is plagued with painful pus - filled sores and says she could n't even kiss her husband on her wedding day			1
pain : @entity8 was left in agony after she agreed to have permanent filler injected into her lips ' he was very reassuring so i decided to have the injections because i 'd already made my way there , ' she says of the fateful moment she agreed to the jabs			1
' i 'd put my trust in the surgeon because you do , do n't you ? you assume that they know their job better than you do			2
' getting married for the first time in her early 40s , @entity8 had wanted to look her best for her lavish @entity35 nuptials and hoped that the beauty jabs would boost her confidence			1
' it 's fair to say i 've always been insecure about my looks , ' she admits			0
' i do have some problems with my skin which have led to a great deal of self - confidence issues			0
' but to get married in my 40s and to the husband of my dreams - i wanted to look the best i possibly could			1
' with the support of her husband - to - be , three months before the wedding , she decided to have a natural , non-permanent filler injected as a confidence boost			1
sore : the jabs led to the appearance of pus - filled lumps that were so painful , even kissing hurt ' the whole idea was that it would only last for three months so i would look lovely for the wedding and then get back to the natural look after the wedding , ' she explains			1
but after being talked into having a permanent boost instead , she was horrified by the almost instantaneous bad reaction she suffered			1
' my lips swelled up like footballs , ' she remembers			0
' i 've never seen anything like it			0
i was told to keep freezing them with ice packs			0
' when the swelling subsided , she noticed painful lumps beginning to form in their place			0
' i have never been in so much pain , ' she adds			0
' if you pushed onto my lips where the lumps were , they would swell up			2
' excruciating : years after she had the jabs , @entity8 remains in pain and still has lumps all over her lips ruined : @entity8 on her wedding day which was spoiled by her painful lips as her wedding day approached , the lumps continued to become increasingly agonising and by the time the big day arrived , they were so sore just brushing them caused her pain			1
' i was slightly dreading the kiss , so it ended up as quite a quick kiss , ' she remembers			0
' we did embrace because it was our wedding day but my lips were stinging and starting to get a little bit bigger			1
' i was disappointed because i really feel the fairytale that i had in my mind was n't what i ended up with			0
' the effects of the permanent filler also had an impact on the early years of her marriage and @entity8 says she would love to be able to live a normal life again			1
' years after these injections , i still have sensitive lumps in my lips , ' she adds			2
' we were hoping they would go down , that we 'd be able to kiss , hug and everything as a normal couple , but they have n't			2
' commenting on the case , cranio - facial plastic surgeon , @entity114 said : ' sometimes in the early stages when you get lumps forming , steroid injections can be very effective			2
' but when you 're a few years down the line and have really solid , hard lumps , it 's very rare that injections will settle them down			0
' i spend a lot of my time trying to remove permanent fillers for patients who have had complications with them			0
' he added : ' my personal feeling is that permanent fillers should be banned			0
' @entity8 appears on @entity132 : brides , tomorrow at 10pm on @entity134			2
