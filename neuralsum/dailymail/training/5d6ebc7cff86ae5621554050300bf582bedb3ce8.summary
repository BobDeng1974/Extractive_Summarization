she was once the pet of @entity2 royalty but now the loneliest orangutan in the world pines away her days in a miserable zoo with no companion , no toys , no leafy trees and only a concrete block to sleep on			1
it is believed @entity12 , aged about 12 and about to grow into adulthood , has never seen another orangutan apart from her murdered mother and , says a devoted wildlife activist who is determined to find her a better life , because of her total isolation she thinks she ’s the only orangutan in the world			1
alone in her squalid surroundings , she does n’t know how to behave like an orangutan , unable to exhibit natural behaviours usually displayed in a leafy environment shared with other youngsters			1
visitors throw junk food at her and have been caught trying to force her to smoke a cigarette			0
she has no bedding and is forced to sit on cold concrete everyday for at least 12 hours after the zoo is closed			1
orangutans were sometimes referred to as the wild men of @entity35 by @entity37 colonialists , but those days of centuries past were when the jungles were alive with healthy populations of the orange - furred ape			2
her concrete sleeping quarters are behind her @entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan , peers out from the bars of her bleak night cage where she has only a concrete floor to sleep on in @entity48 , @entity2 today it is estimated that only 50,000 remain in the wild on the @entity57 island of @entity58 and on @entity35 , which is shared by @entity57 and @entity2			1
their world is dying around them , as trees come down to make way for oil palm plantations and adult apes and babies are hacked to death by workers protecting the planted trees			1
for those people , hungry orangutans are pests which must be destroyed			0
‘ @entity43 ’s mother was without a doubt murdered because that is the only way you are going to get a baby away from an adult orangutan , ’ says 33 - year - old @entity73 , director of the @entity75 - based @entity74 , a man who is totally committed to saving the apes as many other welfare groups in his country sit idly by			1
@entity86 is the forgotten @entity87 of @entity35 , for without mr @entity73 ’s work it is unlikely that anyone would even know she is in the tiny , decaying zoo , aside from the handful of visitors who call by and - as is often the case - try to throw anything at hand at her including junk food			1
a campaign is growing to find her a mate and a @entity102 group is calling for better conditions			2
campaigner mr @entity73 says : ‘ i only need to look into her eyes and i can see the loneliness there			0
where is the spark that i ’ve seen in other orangutans ? she sits around without a soul nearby because everything has had to be fenced off to try to stop people throwing stuff at her			0
' @entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan who is believed to have never seen another of her species apart from her murdered mother , climbs in her bleak enclosure in @entity48 , @entity2 @entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan , sits forlornly at the top of a bare tree as @entity125 spreads in @entity126 , @entity2			1
she does not exhibit normal behaviours because she has never had a mate mr @entity73 drives me across the @entity2 peninsula , a three hour journey to the town of @entity126 , which was a gold mining centre before the @entity37 arrived in 1887.the state capital has since dramatically declined and the decaying , tiny zoo on a hillside overlooking the town attracts few tourists			1
‘ i ’ve got a bit of a reputation for getting places closed down because of cruelty concerns and while i have been shocked at some of the things i ’ve seen , i ’m really worried about @entity43 , ’ he says as we step down the hillside towards the cages			1
‘ she climbs a tree which has no leaves and sits there all day , doing nothing			0
then during the hours of darkness she ’s locked in a night cage which has nothing but a concrete floor			0
' she ’s as miserable as sin - i can see that - and i ’m determined to get her moved to a place where there are other orang - utans and where she can be happy for the rest of her life			1
’ what has infuriated mr @entity73 is the fact that the government has spent at least £ 10 million on building an enclosure for two @entity168 pandas at the @entity169 , the national animal enclosure , yet not a penny has been spent on upgrading the seriously under - funded @entity48 or doing anything to help the lonely orangutan			2
‘ while the pandas are receiving daily enrichment , @entity43 receives none			2
she is not going to enjoy a full and healthy life is this torture continues , ’ says mr @entity73			0
@entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan plays on a rope , her only plaything , in her enclosure in the @entity48 , @entity2			1
she has never had a companion suburbia creeps in on the miserable domain of @entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan in a tiny zoo in @entity190 , @entity2 , after she was kept as a pet by a royal family			1
she has never had a mate and pines away her days a wildlife investigator snuck into the zoo at night to check on how @entity43 was sleeping and , by torchlight , found her slumped on concrete in a corner			1
that is how it has been every night for at least 12 hours for the past three years since she was handed to the zoo			2
‘ i ’ve been told on good authority that she was a pet with one of @entity2 ’s nine royal families , having come through the illegal wildlife trade			1
then , when she got too big to handle , she was passed to the zoo , ’ says mr @entity73			2
we walk past cages with rusty bars staring in at sad animals that include a small leopard cat that was being tormented by three children who were screaming at it and laughing as it tried to hide behind its bleak , concrete home			0
@entity43 ’s enclosure is quite large but bare of any leafy trees			1
she is sitting on top of a barren tree staring down at us			0
in the valley below her are houses that have swallowed up the forests that once covered this region			0
the viewing platform into her enclosure is wrapped in wire mesh to try stop people throwing rubbish at her - but they still feed her junk food			2
there is not a keeper in sight - in fact the only employee to be found is an elderly lady sitting in the ticket booth at the entrance			2
@entity43 , the world 's loneliest orangutan , comes from the light into the darkness as she enters her night cage at @entity48 , @entity2 ‘ people still manage to toss junk food at @entity12 and it does n’t stop there - they throw lighted cigarette at her , hoping she ’ll put on a show and smoke one			1
’ @entity86 climbs down from her roost and grabs a rope that is stretched across the enclosure and pulls herself along it			0
she ’s putting on a harmless kind of show for us - but then she scuttles off into the darkness of her night cage			0
this is her life , nothing more - and mr @entity73 is determined to change it for the better			0
he has been pressing the @entity261 to immediately transfer @entity262 to the @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity35 , where the @entity265 provides excellent care for orang - utans saved from abuse			0
‘ this is now very urgent			0
we need to take her away from her misery			0
she has probably not been with her kind since infancy after losing her mother , ’ says mr @entity73			0
‘ orangutans can not be left to live alone in captivity			0
in @entity43 ’s case it is solitary confinement of the very worst kind			2
’ mr @entity73 ’s group @entity74 , has started a petition in the hope that animal lovers around the world will join forces to have @entity43 moved to the @entity263			2
the petition can be seen at : @entity290			0

@entity43 used to belong to @entity2 royal family but is now dying alone
she is kept in a miserable zoo with no companion , toys or leafy trees
12 - year - old does **n't** act like an orangutan because she has **n't** known others
her mother was murdered when she was a baby , now she is on her own
campaigners are desperate for her to get a mate as she is suffering so much
