by @entity0 @entity1 as @entity2 in @entity3 @entity3 is n't just one of the biggest shows on tv - thanks to its bloodlust and lashings of female nudity it 's also one of the most controversial			1
and few figures are more controversial than that of @entity14 , who plays @entity15			1
on screen she 's a fearsome creature who , aged just 12 , has already killed one man - and you can expect the murder count to tot up in the new series , which starts this week			2
she 's been orphaned by the terrible war that sees several factions vying for the throne			2
in the last series ' now infamous @entity32 scene , her brother , sister - in - law and mother were all brutally murdered while attending what was meant to be a happy occasion			2
but 16 - year - old @entity1 's attracted controversy off screen too , thanks to her decision to leave formal education before she even took her gcses			1
but the articulate , @entity42 - born daughter of a university administrator and businessman insists she did n't really have a choice			2
' my school would n't let me go off and film so we had a polite conversation where they kind of asked me to leave , ' she says when we meet			1
' it 's fair enough ; they ca n't teach me if i 'm not there and it 's a black mark against the school to have someone who 's absent			2
but i was working , not bunking off			2
' @entity1 has n't abandoned education though , as she recently started a course in performing arts at @entity61			1
' they 're encouraging me to work and they make it easier to slip back in			0
i know this is something i want to make a career out of			2
@entity3 is just the beginning			1
' the youngest of four children , @entity1 had no professional acting experience when she won the part of @entity2 in the huge @entity73 production			1
she had hoped to make a future in dance but an agent put her forward for the role which required a tomboy - ish girl ; @entity1 fitted in perfectly			1
the show 's been a bigger hit than any of its mainly @entity82 cast could have predicted			0
based on @entity86 's series of fantasy novels , it may feature dragons , zombies and women who give birth to shadows , but even non-fantasy - loving viewers fell in love with its epic battles for power			0
16 - year - old @entity1 is attracted to controversy off screen too , thanks to her decision to leave formal education before she even took her gcses a huge hit around the world , it attracts 14 million viewers in the @entity107 and over 4 million here - it 's @entity109 's biggest show			1
it 's brutally gory , but @entity1 says it did n't take long to get used to the blood			1
' because i 'm the youngest in my family i had to watch movies i was too young for , and they were a lot scarier , ' she says			0
' now i know it 's pretend			0
the fake blood is a sugary liquid which tastes amazing			0
the only things i struggle to watch are torture scenes - but everyone struggles with those			0
' for @entity1 , who has two films , @entity127 and @entity128 , out this year , the hardest aspect of being a star is dealing with the fame ; she 's been the victim of @entity131 abuse but insists she can deal with it			1
' i 've put myself on social media so i have to take the consequences , ' she says			0
' one thing that comes up is i have a wide face and big eyebrows			0
everyone has their insecurities so i wear it as my armour			0
instead of tweezing my eyebrows i make them bigger			0
' indeed , on the day we meet she 's painted make - up on her eyebrows			0
war paint for a surprisingly normal girl			0
