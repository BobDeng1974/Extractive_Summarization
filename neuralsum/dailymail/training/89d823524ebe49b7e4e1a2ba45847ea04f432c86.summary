the parents of an aspiring weatherman who died from a gunshot wound to the head have slammed a police investigation into his death as ' a whitewash ' after it ruled their son took his own life			1
@entity10 and @entity11 said they are now hiring a private investigator to look into the death of their son @entity14			1
the distraught couple said they are disgusted by the report which blames the 22 - year - old for his own death			1
an ' extensive investigation ' into the young man 's death by police in @entity25 ruled that he had been ranting about suicide at a friend 's home before grabbing the barrel of a loaded gun and pointing it at his head			1
last picture : @entity34 ( left ) shared the picture with friends of him at a barbecue with his friend and room mate @entity38 ( right ) on the day he died			1
@entity38 said the 22 - yeat - old honor student had everything to live for			1
this is the last picture of him alive doubts : his parents , @entity47 and @entity11 , say he had everything to live for and would n't have taken his life @entity14 was shot in the head with the trigger apparently pulled by 26 - year - old @entity52 who was holding the gun			1
' the police report is a load of bulls * * *			1
it is a whitewash and full of lies , ' said @entity59			0
' my son did not take his own life			0
we wanted justice for @entity65 and we have not got this			0
' we are hiring a private investigator to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth			2
' @entity14 , who was studying meteorology at the @entity73 , @entity71 , @entity25 , died on september 13th			1
he was due to graduate next year and had already completed a successful internship at a local tv station in @entity76 and lined up a job on his graduation			0
on the day he died @entity34 had been hosting a bbq with his roommate @entity38			1
@entity38 told @entity81 his friend had ' everything to live for ' and had not been depressed			1
he supplied the last ever photo of @entity11 taken at the bbq with the pair smiling as they cooked for friends at their rented home in @entity71			1
tragic : student @entity34 suffered a single gunshot to the head , dying as a result			1
he was studying to become a meteorologist at @entity73 , @entity93 scene of tragedy : the screened in porch where @entity34 died			1
four other people were in the house at the time			0
less than two hours later the aspiring weatherman was dead from a single gunshot wound to the head			1
he had gone to a friend 's house in nearby @entity105 to feed their dogs			2
according to the four people inside the home @entity34 started expressing suicidal thoughts after making a phone call			2
the police report said he had excused himself to make the call and when he returned was in an ' agitated mood '			1
moments later he grabbed a gun that @entity52 had been holding while the two men talked about @entity52 's previous suicidal thoughts the handgun 's magazine had been removed but there was still a bullet in the chamber			1
the report makes clear that @entity14 grabbed the gun and pulled it towards his head			1
it is thought @entity52 's finger was on the trigger when the gun went off			1
however , the report clearly contradicts the earlier statement made by @entity129 who witnessed the killing			0
when police responded to an emergency call , she told the arriving officer she saw @entity34 take the gun and pull the trigger			1
@entity135 said : ' she advised that the victim , identified by her as @entity65 , also observed the magazine being removed from the weapon			2
' she advised that she saw the victim take the weapon , place it to his head and pull the trigger			2
she advised that the victim then collapsed to the floor			0
' she then began saying that she believed the shooting was actually an accident as the weapon was supposed to be unloaded			0
' the police report makes no mention of @entity11 pulling the trigger			1
@entity59 said the report compiled by @entity105 police chief @entity149 was ' full of lies '			1
he takes exception to the claim by witnesses that his son had become agitated after calling home			0
' mr @entity157 told me that the witnesses said @entity65 went out to make a phone call to his mother and then came back in an agitated state			0
that is just a lie			0
' we had not spoken to @entity65 for several hours			0
there was no call to us before he died			0
the phone records will prove that			0
also in the house : @entity129 , 22 , a classmate of @entity172 , made the 911 call to say he had shot himself			2
a voice int he background can be heard apparently saying : ' i did it			2
' @entity129 then tells that person : ' no , you did n't			0
you did n't kill him			0
' on the rise : @entity34 , pictured right , had completed an internship with @entity185 in @entity76 over the summer ' the police have just taken the word of those in the house and they have @entity189 have not looked into anything about @entity65 otherwise they would know that he was not suicidal			2
' we are beside ourselves			0
the others in the house had lied to cover themselves			0
' the four people in the house were named as @entity129 , @entity52 , @entity196 , and @entity197			2
police initially become suspicious about the death due to a call to the 911 dispatcher when a male voice could be heard in the background saying : ' i did it '			1
@entity129 , who made the 911 call , replied : ' no , you did n't			0
you did not kill him			0
' @entity129 refused to talk with @entity81 when contacted at the civil engineering office where she worked in @entity71			1
another puzzling aspect for police was why the why the gun was found in another room away from his body the police investigation clears that aspect up by revealing @entity52 was holding the gun when it went off and said he placed it on a coffee table			1
investigated : @entity105 police chief @entity221 , whose force have now completed their investigation			1
it has been heavily criticized by the dead man 's parents happy : @entity34 with an unnamed friend was said to be enjoying himself at university and had booked tickets home for @entity231 the @entity232 said they had hoped police in @entity105 would have carried out a more thorough investigation			1
' there is so many parts of the report that are wrong , ' said @entity10 , from @entity238 , @entity239			0
' we believe there has been a cover up			0
people are lying and those in the house have come up with a credible story that the police believe			2
' @entity105 police chief @entity149 told me on the phone today that my son was talking to my wife just before he died			1
my wife would know if she talked to her own son			0
the phone records will be the proof as he did not call			0
they have just taken the words of those in the house , and they are lying			0
' we have waited three months for this report and it 's a whitewash			2
@entity65 had just been told by his grandmother that she would pay for his flight ticket home			0
why would he take his own life			0

once in the home , the group began to talk and drink sociably			0
witness statements indicated that after a short period of time , @entity34 excused himself to the rear yard during a phone conversation			2
while @entity34 was in the rear yard speaking on the phone , @entity196 and @entity197 excused themselves to @entity196 's bedroom , in the rear of the residence , for a more private conversation			1
@entity52 and @entity129 were in the front @entity313 when @entity14 returned from his phone conversation in an agitated mood			2

while standing face to face with @entity14 , @entity52 had his handgun out pointing it at himself telling @entity14 about his own past thoughts of harming himself and the fact that it was never the right thing to do			0
