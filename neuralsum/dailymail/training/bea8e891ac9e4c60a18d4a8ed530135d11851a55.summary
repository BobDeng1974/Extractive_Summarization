the @entity0 built astonishing temples in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 - but now some believe the ancient peoples fled their dissolving civilization and ended up in @entity8			1
historian and architect @entity9 believes a 1,100 - year - old archaeological site shows that @entity13 refugees fled @entity14 and ended up in the @entity16 mountains near @entity17			1
his astonishing theory is based on the discovery of 300 to 500 rock terraces and mounds on the side of @entity23 that date to @entity24 - around the time the @entity0 began to die out			1
city spotting : this 3d virtual reality image was made from the ruins found in the @entity23 mountain ruins : @entity30 shows the many mysterious rock pile terraces near the @entity32 in @entity23 , @entity8			1

the remains were first found by retired engineer @entity30 when he went walking in the area in the 1990s			2
archaeologist @entity59 excavated part of the site and wrote a report about it in 2010 , but does not believe the rock terraces are @entity13			1

@entity76 archaeology professor @entity75 , left , who was cited in his article , labelled it as ' complete bunk ' mr @entity59 , who excavated a rock wall and small mound , added that claims like this must be backed up with ‘ hard evidence ’ because of the various conflicting opinions in the archaeological world			1
' mr @entity59 believes the structures could have been built by the @entity88 or an earlier tribe between @entity90 and @entity91			0
' it is possibly the site of the fabled city of @entity39 , which @entity42 explorer @entity40 failed to find in 1540 , and certainly one of the most important archaeological discoveries in recent times ' he stopped digging because he realized the site could be a grave			0
still , mr @entity9 claims early maps of the location named two villages ‘ @entity104 ’ , which was how @entity49 described themselves			1
the terrace structures and date helped him reach his conclusion			2
' it was commonplace for the @entity109 to sculpt a hill into a pentagonal mound , ' he argues			0

‘ wild theories are not new , but the web simply spreads them faster than ever			0
’ mr @entity9 was n't bothered by the ensuing debate , in fact , that 's exactly what he wanted			2
' i ’m not an archaeologist			0
i ’m a big picture man , ' said mr @entity147 to the @entity56			0
' we ’re hoping this article stirs up some interest			0

' @entity158 , @entity75 he works with a company called @entity160 that helps create three - dimensional maps of excavated sites and said that when he compared his map of the @entity8 site , it reminded him of other @entity13 works			1
' it ’s identical to sites in @entity169 , ' he argued			0
the @entity0 have been under intense scrutiny over the past few years as rumors abound about their mysterious 5,125 - year calendar allegedly predicting the apocalypse on december 21 2012			2
