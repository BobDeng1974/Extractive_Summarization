by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 8 november 2013 @entity2 : 08:53 est , 8 november 2013 if you think you give your workout gear a run for its money with punishing sessions of @entity8 and @entity9 , spare a thought for the likes of @entity12 and @entity13 , the stars of @entity15 : catching @entity16 , the second in the trilogy , released later this month			1
they 're not just sweating in yoga studios and doing press - ups in the mud , they 're throwing swords , shooting arrows and generally trying to stay alive in the most inhospitable environment ever			0
when the film 's costume designer , @entity30 was trying to find the right sort of clothes for the tributes to wear in the arena , she googled ' futuristic sportswear '			1
' everything we do is about the future , ' explains @entity60 , who developed the line after feeling that there was a gap in the market for designer - style sportswear that was attractive , functional and wearable outside of the gym			1
but the hostile setting of the arena is quite different from the yoga studios of @entity70 , how could @entity60 be sure that her designs would stand up to the rigours of the @entity15 ? ' everything we design is created for extremes of movement , so that you can do anything and your top wo n't ride up , or twist			2
futuristic style : @entity15 characters @entity41 and @entity83 share a moment before the games begin @entity15 : catching @entity16 is set for release on 21 november newcomer : @entity88 also sports designs by designer @entity90 ' all our seams are glued so that they do n't rub , and the fabrics have compression technology to support your muscles , and are antibacterial and designed to wick away moisture , ' says @entity60			1
' all the pieces in my collection are tested by professional sportspeople - i know a lot of personal trainers so kit really gets put through its paces to make sure it really is fit for everything from running and weight - lifting to pilates			1
' while many of the outfits - such as the @entity111 jacket ( £ 320 ) and the @entity113 capri pants ( £ 165 ) which you 'll see @entity41 wearing while training for the @entity115 - translated directly from the main collection to the film set , one aspect that was slightly more challenging was menswear			2
' i 'd never designed menswear before and initially i thought i knew exactly what i wanted but at the first fitting it became clear that certain things just did n't work , ' says @entity60			0
extension of the collection : @entity12 adorns a similar style ' @entity111 ' jacket which can be currently brought online at @entity128 ' there were - um - certain bits that needed to be concealed , ' she laughs			2
while all the womenswear looks that are showcased in the film are available to buy at @entity133 , any men who fancy emulating @entity45 will have to wait a while			0
' designing menswear for the film has inspired me to create a menswear line alongside the existing womenswear collection , but that wo n't launch until next @entity142 , ' reveals @entity60			0
and , it seems that @entity12 was so taken with the @entity38 kit , that when the cameras stopped rolling , she did n't want to take it off			0
' i 'm good friends with @entity12 's personal trainer and i have it on good authority that she still wears it and loves it , ' beams @entity60 .			0
