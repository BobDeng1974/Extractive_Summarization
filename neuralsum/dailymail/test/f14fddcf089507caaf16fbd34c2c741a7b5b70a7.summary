a young woman has managed to find her doppelgänger after launching a campaign on @entity3 as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind - blowing			1
@entity7 , a 26 - year - old tv presenter from @entity8 , teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed @entity11 to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days , and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world			1
incredibly , @entity7 found her match in @entity17 , 29 , a fellow @entity18 native who lives just an hour down the road , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together			1
' for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her			2
i could n’t get over her face , and some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " @entity37 that ’s my face			0
" ' i ca n’t remember the number of times i said " this is so freaky "			2
' @entity17 , who is currently in between jobs , has five sisters and a brother			2
@entity7 has a brother and two sisters , and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another			1
@entity7 said the pair got on ' very well ' as they both applied make - up before the shoot , swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities			2
' for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her			0
i could n’t get over her face , ' said @entity7 ( left ) they meet ! ' i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me ' @entity7 ( right ) said about @entity17 ( left ) @entity7 added , ' i ca n’t remember the number of times i said " this is so freaky "			1
it was truly amazing ' ' i would say @entity17 is the shyer of the two of us , ' @entity7 remarked			1
' but then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me			0
' i knew what search i was embarking on			0
i ’m the weirdo that contacted @entity74 and asked her to meet me in person			0
' since meeting , @entity7 and @entity17 - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity3 ' constantly '			1
@entity17 ( right ) turned out to be a fellow @entity18 native who lived just an hour down the road from @entity7 ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " @entity90 that ’s my face " ' while @entity7 appears to have beaten her fellow @entity11 participants , 21 - year - old @entity93 and 22 - year - old @entity94 , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27			1
' i think i have a two , maybe three at a push who resemble me			0
but they 're definitely not as close a match as @entity17 to @entity7 , ' @entity93 says			1
' i 'm trailing further behind , ' admits @entity94			0
' must be a guy thing			0
they tend to be a bit too shy to participate			0
not sure if being originally from @entity102 has anything to do with it ! ' @entity7 ( right ) said she and @entity17 ( left ) got on ' very well ' as they both applied make - up before the shoot , swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities ( pictured ) friends for life ? since meeting , @entity7 ( right ) and @entity17 ( left ) - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity3 ' constantly ' feedback : shocked reactions to @entity17 and @entity7 's story have flooded in from far and wide challenge : @entity7 's ( right ) fellow @entity11 participants , 21 - year - old @entity93 ( left ) and 22 - year - old @entity94 ( centre ) , are still looking for their doppelgängers , and the search is n't over until april 27 @entity7 , who is still promoting the project across social media with @entity93 and @entity94 as interest spreads , says there will be no prize for the winner , just ' pride '			1
they are inviting others from around the world to join in too now , by adding users ' photos to their @entity3 album			0
' there is a huge human curiosity element to it , ' @entity7 states			2
' can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you ? '			0
