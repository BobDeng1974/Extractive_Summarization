by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 11 january 2013 missed : @entity2 could have been prosecuted in 2009 but police and prosecutors were too cautious , a report has found a chance to convict @entity2 for sex offences when he was alive was missed because police and prosecutors did not take victims seriously enough , an official report said today			1
details of a review of the decision not to prosecute @entity2 in 2009 by @entity13 , legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions , were disclosed today			1
her report was released in tandem with an official police probe into the @entity19 's 60 years of abuse that revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 , including children as young as eight			1
since the paedophile dj died in october 2011 aged 84 , a staggering 214 official crimes have been recorded by 28 police forces			0
in her review ms @entity28 found one alleged victim was told by @entity32 police officers that @entity2 's lawyers would make ' mincemeat ' of her in a ' big @entity36 court ' if she pursued her sex assault claim			1
in 1970 , the @entity39 fan club member had been groped and forced to touch the @entity19 's genitals after he invited her into his camper van after she went to watch @entity42 at @entity43			2
after going to the police in 2008 , the woman , known as ms a , was told by investigating officers that ' she would be publicly branded a liar and that her name would be all over the newspapers , particularly if she lost the case ' , the report says			1
deputy chief constable @entity53 from @entity54 said today : ' we recognise that we could have done better and are committed to honest reflection and learning lessons for the future			0
' a statement from @entity54 went on : ' we understand the conclusion the @entity61 has drawn , that our officers may have inadvertently dissuaded the victim from supporting any prosecution			2
it can be difficult in such circumstances to achieve the balance between supporting and reassuring a victim , whilst providing honest advice about the prosecution process and standard of evidence needed			0
' this ' dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation ' , she concluded			0
three offences were also being investigated in 2008 by @entity77 but they were not continued either			0
ms @entity28 said that there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories , or that they were unreliable , yet police and prosecutors treated their claims ' with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required ' , she said			1
attack : one victim was told by police that if she pursued her claim @entity2 's lawyers would make ' mincemeat ' of her in court @entity77 received an allegation in may 2007 that @entity2 had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at @entity96 in the late 1970s			1
in the investigation that followed , two more allegations emerged - the first that in about 1973 @entity2 had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside @entity101			2
the second was that in the 1970s @entity2 had suggested to a girl aged about 17 , again at @entity104 , that she perform oral sex on him			2
pledge : @entity106 , the director of public prosecutions , said today the way sexual abuse is investigated will be changed in march 2008 , @entity54 received a complaint that @entity2 had sexually assaulted a woman in her early twenties in a caravan in @entity32 in about 1970			1
@entity77 consulted with the @entity113 about all four allegations , and in october 2009 it was decided that no prosecution could be brought because the alleged victims would not support police action			1
ms @entity28 found that @entity77 did not tell each alleged victim that other complaints had been made , @entity32 told the complainant that corroboration was needed and the prosecutor did not question why victims would not support court action or seek to build a case			1
the victims told ms @entity28 that if they had known that other people were making complaints , they probably would have been prepared to give evidence in court			2
meanwhile her review showed how @entity2 had simply said that the accusations were just ' invented ' and an ' occupational hazard ' for anyone famous like him			1
he also said he had a ' policy ' to sue anyone who printed these accusations , having taken legal action against five papers previously			0
' if this does not disappear then my policy will swing into action ' , he told @entity145 officers , the report says			0
@entity77 assistant chief constable @entity146 said : ' it is important the actions taken by the investigation team are viewed in context			0
this should take into account what information was known about @entity2 in 2007 and the necessary consideration given by police to the impact of their actions on securing successful court action against him			1
' at the time , there was nothing to suggest the level of offending now being reported on a national scale			0
in july 2007 , @entity77 used national systems to conduct intelligence checks with every other police force in @entity167 and @entity168			0
these checks found no record of any police intelligence or prior allegations relating to @entity2			2
' @entity61 @entity106 said he wanted the case to be ' a watershed moment '			0
' in my view , these cases do not simply reflect errors of judgment by individual officers or prosecutors on the facts before them , ' he said			0
' if that were the case , they would , in many respects , be easier to deal with			0
these were errors of judgment by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles			0
that makes the findings of ms @entity28 's report more profound and calls for a more robust response			0
' ' hazard ' : @entity2 , who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in his camper van , had told police that the allegations aimed at him was just because he was famous and were malicious he drew parallels with a damning report on the investigation of a grooming gang in @entity203			1
mr @entity106 said police and prosecutors have approached sex offence allegations ' with a degree of caution which is not generally justified '			1
he said guidance will be drawn up on prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases to underline that ' the credibility of the complainant 's account has to be seen in its proper context '			1
an agreement has been drawn up with the @entity216 that : mr @entity106 also said that information on cases where a complaint has been made but a prosecution can not be brought will be shared more fully with police and other relevant agencies			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

official report finds police and @entity113 treated @entity230 prosecutions ' with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required '
@entity13 says victims were dissuaded from taking cases to court while the @entity19 was alive
victim told by @entity32 police in 2008 she would be ' publicly branded a liar and that her name would be all over the newspapers ' but media laws would have ensured she stayed *anonymous*
@entity2 told police accusations were ' invented ' and an ' occupational hazard ' conjured up because he was famous
new *guidelines* to be drawn up by @entity113 on prosecuting child sex cases
the approach of police and prosecutors to credibility in sexual assault cases must change , with **testing** the *suspect* 's account and actively building cases being treated as importantly as **testing** the alleged victim 's story .
more support should be given to those who make allegations , and the number of times *vulnerable* victims can be *cross-examined* in court will be *reconsidered* .
victims who have made allegations in the past that they feel have not been properly dealt with will have the chance to ask for their cases to be looked at again by *joint* police and @entity113 *panels* .
