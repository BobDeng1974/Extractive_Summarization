this snappy shark was clearly not in the mood for a close - up , snatching one petrified photographer 's camera straight out of his arms before swimming off into the distance with it			1
after posing for several pictures during a diving expedition in the @entity11 , the toothy tyrant obviously decided enough was enough			2
swimming up to the horrified photographer , the tiger shark grabbed the expensive camera in his ferocious jaws			1
surrounded : the diver , pictured holding the specialist camera above , is circled by several @entity12 sharks on the seabed in the @entity11 thief : as the other sharks move away , one stays close to the diver and eyes up the camera it then calmly swam off with the £ 11,000 piece of kit			1
thankfully , the photographer and guide managed to get the camera back - as the disinterested shark dropped it only 100 metres away			1
fellow photographer , @entity33 , watched the sly shark pinch the camera and managed to capture the commotion on camera			2
the 49 - year - old , who works as a gp in the north east of @entity41 , said : ' the shark literally took the camera straight from the hands of our guide photographer			2
what 's that you got there ? the creature looks straight down the camera at the photographer , perhaps trying to decipher what he is holding what are you looking at ? the deadly animal gets up close and personal to the divers showing off his daunting set of teeth ' the equipment has arms and strobes attached so it immediately attracted the attention of the shark , it 's very bulky so it was easy for the shark to grab hold of			1
' they are very powerful and can swim long distances very fast			0
' luckily though the shark decided to drop the camera onto the sea bed about 100 metres away			1
' the guide was actually very lucky to get the camera back			0
' it cost around £ 11,000 with the housing and it would have only taken him a few minutes to swim miles away			2
' miraculously it was in perfect condition without so much as a scratch			0
it 's amazing really considering the slightest crack would allow the salt water in and destroy it in seconds			0
' it 's crazy how sharks can have such sharp teeth and such a gentle bite			2
' it 's mine now ! the tiger shark makes off with the £ 11,000 piece of kit held tightly in his grasp expensive steal : the divers said the equipment , which has arms and strobes attached , was quite easy for the shark to pick - up in his jaws @entity33 said although it was a once in a lifetime experience he was petrified of what might happen next			1
he said : ' at the time i was diving without a cage , it was a great experience but i would n't do it again as it was too dangerous			1
' when i saw the shark take the camera from the photographer i rushed to try and get a shot of the extraordinary event			0
' fortunately i managed to get it			0
' i was scared though			0
you never know when a shark is getting too close			0
' they have powerful bites and could take your arm or leg off in a split second			0
not bothered : the culprit thankfully dropped the equipment , in good condition , 100 metres away ' i was n't worried about my camera but i was worried for my personal safety			1
' i 've never seen anything like this before			0
it was an amazing event			0
' tiger sharks are considered to be one of the most dangerous shark species in the world			1
they are responsible for many recorded attacks on humans , second only to the great white shark			1
however , its usual prey is varied and can include anything from crustaceans , fish , seals , birds , squid , turtles , and sea snakes , to dolphins and even other smaller sharks			0
the tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to fishing by humans .			2

diver @entity33 , 49 , was swimming without a cage when the tiger shark approached
deadly shark grabbed the specialist , £ 11,000 camera and swam off
luckily , it dropped the equipment 100 metres away on the sea *floor* in the @entity11
tiger sharks are the world 's second most dangerous *breed* - just behind the great white
' it was a great experience but i would n't do it again as it was too dangerous , ' says @entity175
