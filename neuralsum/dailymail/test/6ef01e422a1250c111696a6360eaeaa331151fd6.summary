in a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young @entity5 talent in the @entity6 , it ’s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have all enjoyed excellent @entity6 campaigns			1
defence is not the easiest area for a young player to make an impression — managers can be reluctant to trust youth in a position of responsibility — but these three have done just that			1
what sets them apart is their self - belief			2
@entity28 and @entity29 are still 20 and @entity13 is 21 , but there are no signs of fear in their games			1
@entity34 defender @entity12 ( left ) has impressed in his first season at the club @entity37 defender @entity14 ( right ) puts in a challenge against @entity40 striker @entity39 @entity41 defender @entity13 ( left ) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at @entity44 in a way , we should n’t really be surprised			1
between them they have cost £ 19million , so they are not exactly surprise packages			2
what has been surprising is the way they have come on this season			2
they are by no means the finished article , but their progress is encouraging			2
it helps that all three have had a taste of playing at full back			0
i think they are all destined to become top central defenders , but if you are mobile enough , you are often asked to do a job at full back			0
at this stage it certainly does no harm to your development			0
i remember playing at right back before moving to the middle			2
you need pace and stamina to bomb up and down but when it comes to playing at centre half , that agility can be of huge benefit			0
i first saw @entity13 playing for the @entity79 and he still looked raw			1
he was a powerful , quick right back who charged up and down , but he needed more control			0
i felt his body type made him ideally suited to centre half and he has made that position his own at @entity41			1
@entity13 ( left ) stood up strongly against @entity86 striker @entity85 in the @entity88 final at @entity89 stones has moved across from right back into the centre of defence for @entity37 and has flourished his rise has been quite spectacular			1
he has gone from a promising squad player to a first - team regular alongside @entity96			1
he moves the ball well , is technically very good and he is a fighter — he stood up well to @entity85 in the @entity88 final at @entity89			0
the next step for him is to become a vocal leader			0
the best central defenders demand so much from those around them and if that mentality is drilled into him , @entity13 could improve @entity41 ’s rather soft underbelly			1
stones has spent time at right back but now finds himself at the heart of the @entity37 defence			1
he is very comfortable on the ball , has good speed and reads the game well so is rarely beaten one on one			0
he can tackle with either foot and his timing is excellent — just when you think he is beaten , he nicks the ball			0
he is comfortable playing out of defence but he has to be careful not to overplay			0
he is good in the air but can improve , especially from wide crosses and set - pieces			2
experience will help him become more wily			0
with @entity28 , i never doubted he was going to the right club , but i did wonder how many games he would play at @entity34			1
with lots of competition for places , he has a real fight on his hands but he has already made 35 appearances this season			1
of the three he is the best on the ball and if he makes a mistake , there is no drop in confidence — he still wants to make forward passes			0
that passing ability means there could be value in trying him in midfield , though that would require careful planning to bed him in			0
@entity28 ( right ) has played at right back , centre - back and midfield for @entity34 during the season @entity79 manager @entity148 could be tempted to field the trio in a back three for the @entity150 in one on ones , sometimes he does n’t look set			1
he likes to put an arm on the attacker to slow them down and that ’s partly why he has picked up eight bookings this season and been sent off			2
he tries to win the ball in the first few strides and can be prone to gambling			0
all three have taken huge steps forward this season , and with @entity79 using two centre - back partnerships in the last two games , those positions could be up for grabs			1
and if @entity148 wants to fit more attacking players into his @entity79 side in the future , there ’s no reason why this trio , with their experiences at full back , could n’t play together in a back three			0
it would certainly be a useful option .			0

@entity12 has played 35 times already for @entity34 this season
@entity13 has become an *important* first - team player at @entity41
@entity14 has impressed for @entity37 after being moved to the middle
