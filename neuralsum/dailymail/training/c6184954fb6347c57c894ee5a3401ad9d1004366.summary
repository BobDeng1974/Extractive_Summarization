the lubricating effect of melting water on glaciers will have only a ‘ minor ’ role in future sea level rises , according to new research			1
scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers as it acts as a lubricant between the ice and the ground it moves over			1
but a team from the @entity16 found it is likely to have a minor role in sea level rises , compared with other effects such as iceberg production and surface melt			1
the lubricating effect of melting water on glaciers will have only a ' minor ' role in future sea level rises , according to new research results from computer modelling - based on fieldwork observations in @entity27 - revealed that lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution from the @entity27 ice sheet			1
some simulations found the lubricating effect could even have a negative impact on sea level rise - leading to a lowering of sea level when the other major factors were ignored			0
@entity39 , from the @entity16 , was lead author of the research , which was published in @entity41 ( @entity41 )			0
‘ this is an important step forward in our understanding of the factors that control sea level rise from the @entity27 ice sheet , ’ dr @entity39 said			1
scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers as it acts as a lubricant between the ice and the ground it moves over ‘ our results show that melt - water - enhanced lubrication will have a minor contribution to future sea level rise			1
future mass loss will be governed by changes in surface melt water runoff or iceberg calving			2
’ scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers by acting as a lubricant between the ice and the ground			2
the researchers found that this is not likely to be the case because a lot of the water runs off through channels meaning it does not act as a lubricant			0
therefore , it is likely to have a minor role in sea level rises compared with other effects , such as iceberg production and surface melt			1
lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution to sea level rises from the @entity27 ice sheet			1
previous studies of the effects of melt water on the speed of ice movement assumed the water created cavities at the bottom of ice masses			0
these cavities filled with water which lifted the ice slightly and acted as a lubricant , speeding up flow			0
the theory led scientists to think that increased melt water would lead directly to more lubrication and a consequent speeding up of the ice flow			0
but the @entity108 study took into account observations indicating larger amounts of melt water may form channels beneath the ice that drain water away			0
this would reduce the water 's lubricating effect			0
the research concluded that the effect on sea level is small , regardless of whether melt water increases or @entity120 added : ‘ we found that the melt water would lead to a redistribution of the ice , but not necessarily to an increase in flow			2
’ the findings are part of research undertaken through the @entity131 - funded ice2sea programme			0
results from computer modelling revealed that lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution to sea level rises from the @entity27 ice sheet earlier research from ice2sea found changes in surface melting of the ice sheet will be the major factor in sea level rise contributions from @entity27			1
professor @entity144 , ice2sea co-ordinator based at the @entity145 in @entity146 , said : ‘ this is important work but it 's no reason for complacency			0
while this work shows that the process of lubrication of ice flow by surface melting is rather insignificant , our projections are still that @entity27 will be a major source of future sea - level rise			2
‘ as we have reported earlier this year , run - off of surface melt water directly into the ocean and increased iceberg calving are likely to dominate			2

scientists feared water which trickles down through ice could speed up the movement of glaciers as it acts as lubricant between the ice and the ground
however , they discovered this process will probably only have a minor role in sea level rises compared to iceberg *carving* and surface melt
lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution to sea level rises from the @entity27 ice sheet
