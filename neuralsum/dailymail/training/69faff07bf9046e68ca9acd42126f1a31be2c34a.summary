by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:50 est , 9 december 2013 warring genes could be the cause of hot flushes that menopausal women can experience , scientists said at last women have someone to blame for the menopause – their parents			1
scientists claim that the hormonal mayhem is the result ‘ genetic warfare ’ between the dna a woman inherits from her mother and that of her father			2
one set of genes wants her to continue having children			2
the other wants her to stop			0
the result is the hot flushes , mood swings , night sweats and other symptoms that go to make up the menopause			2
the @entity32 and @entity33 researchers said that learning more about the genes involved could lead to a test that tells a woman how long she has in which to start a family			1
the study builds on the popular idea that the menopause evolved as a way of stopping our female ancestors from having children while they were still young enough to help care for the children of younger female relatives living nearby			2
this allowed them to safeguard their genetic line , by lavishing their children and those of relatives with love and attention , without having to go through the trauma of childbirth again			0
the team featured researchers from @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , @entity64 in @entity65 and @entity66 , the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity33			1
they say that , in times gone by , women tended to move away from home and in with their husband ’s family once they got married			0
this meant their children would typically be related to more of those around them through their father than their mother			0
as a result , the genes a girl inherited from her father would in adulthood strive to stop her from having more children of her own so she could instead care for young relatives around her			0
however , the dna she got from her mother would want her to have more children of her own , to help ensure the genes from her mother ’s side lived on			1
@entity63 researcher dr @entity90 , who used maths to back up the theory , said : ‘ the woman ’s paternal genes are pushing for an earlier menopause , while her maternal genes are trying to stall the process			1
’ this conflict of interest could explain not only why women go through the menopause but also why it lasts so long and is so turbulent , the journal @entity99 reports			0
the study will be used to inform the development of personalised family planning ( the pill is pictured ) and preventative medicine for treating cardiovascular problems and even some cancers @entity64 researcher dr @entity110 said learning more about the genes involved in menopause could help women decide how long to wait to start a family			1
he said : ‘ now , when people are trying to decide , the best bit of advice they can be given is to look at the age their mother underwent the menopause			0
’ dr @entity90 added : ‘ choosing if and when to start a family is one of the biggest decisions that we have to make in our lives			0
‘ having better , individualised information about when our fertility is likely to tail off will help avoid anxiety and make sure that people do n’t leave it too late			0
’ the research could also help doctors decide which methods of family planning they should prescribe , based on a woman ’s genetic background			2
in the @entity32 , the average age for a woman to reach the menopause – when their ovaries stop producing an egg every four weeks – is 52 , although many experience it in their 30s or 40s			1
earlier research found that the drop in oestrogen levels during the menopause could be linked to the ‘ senior moments ’ suffered by older women but that hormone replacement therapy ( @entity148 ) helped .			1

researchers from the @entity32 and @entity33 discovered that a woman **'s** genes are conflicted during the menopause , resulting in side effects
a woman **'s** paternal genes are pushing for an earlier menopause , while her maternal genes are trying to stall the process
the research will be used to help the development of personalised *contraception* and preventative medicine for some cancers
