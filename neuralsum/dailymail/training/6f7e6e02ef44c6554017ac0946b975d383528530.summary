' in the airport i started feeling this pain in my hand , ' he said			0
' i looked down and just slid off my seat			0
i was embarrassed more than anything			0

i remembered the advert that helps you look out for the signs of a stroke			2
i tried three times to use the satellite phone on the plane to call @entity55 to tell her i was n't well but it would n't work			1
it was the longest flight of my life			1
i thought that could be it for me			0
' i thought about telling the crew but they were @entity11 and did n't speak very good @entity91			0
i thought , “ what are they going to do ? we 're in mid-air ”			0
it sounds daft but i guess i did n't want to find out the answer was there was nothing they could do			0
@entity0 tried to call his girlfriend @entity55 using the satellite phone , fearing he would not make it home alive ' the side of my body went numb			1

' he said he now has a different outlook on life			2
' i 'm in no rush to get back into tv			0
time is precious and spending time with family is more important than work			0
' stroke is a ' brain attack ' , according to the @entity52			2
its website says : ' for your brain to function , it needs a constant blood supply , which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells			2
a stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and brain cells are damaged or die			1
' about a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a month			0
but most stroke survivors will have long - term problems			1
it may take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery			0
sadly , in the most severe cases , strokes can be fatal or cause long - term disability			0
' it says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the @entity184 test : 1 ) facial weakness - can the person smile ? has their mouth or eye drooped ? 2 ) arm weakness - can the person raise both arms ? 3 ) speech problems - can the person speak clearly and understand what you say ? 4 ) time to call 999			1
the @entity52 says that failing any of these tests means it 's a medical emergency and it 's time to call 999 .			0
