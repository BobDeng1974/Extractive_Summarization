by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:56 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 was rescued from the brink of starvation in a @entity6 gutter and nursed back to good health , only for vets in the @entity9 to rule he was not fit enough to live and must be put down immediately			1
but in a remarkable turn of events - following a ‘ @entity17 ’ campaign that quickly gathered pace , attracting supporters across the world - the @entity16 can now reveal that he will be saved			1
the dog , who is partially paralysed will now be cared for and given daily medical treatment by @entity21 - the charity that saved him from @entity6 - before it is decided if he will be rehomed			1
born survivor : @entity2 is finally able to enjoy his new life in @entity9 after a vet declared he should not be put down worldwide support : this appeal by @entity28 prompted a successful campaign to save the disabled dog yesterday the paper told how the disabled dog had been brought to @entity9 by the charity who discovered him severely crippled and close to death			1
with the help of the public , they funded his medical treatment and several vets deemed him fit enough to be rehomed			1
he then had a brief period with a foster carer who struggled to cope with the demands of having a disabled dog with incontinence and then was rehomed with @entity46 , a manager for @entity21			0
but the partially paralysed dog was taken from his new home by an @entity50 officer – just two hours after arriving there on friday			0
miss @entity46 later received a phone call to say a vet had decided @entity2 was too unwell and must be put down the following day			1
this was despite a video taken days earlier showing the him happily playing and jumping around			0
canine rescue workers described the @entity50 as ‘ barbaric ’ , saying the charity ’s answer to everything is to kill , rather than working with the animals to make them better			0
a ‘ @entity17 ’ campaign was promptly set up by separate charity , @entity63 , which gathered pace almost immediately on social media			0
battle for survival : yesterday the @entity16 highlighted the plight of the terrier who was rescued from starvation in @entity6 , but condemned by the @entity50 because he was not fit enough to lead a happy life saved : @entity2 , who has paralysed legs and has to wear nappies , will now be allowed to live following an examination by @entity76 in @entity77			1
however , he will require constant care and medication last night , more than 9,000 people had signed a petition on campaigning website , @entity83			0
last night a vet from the @entity85 in @entity77 , revealed they believe @entity2 should be allowed to live , but acknowledged that he is severely disabled and will need constant care if his quality of life is to be ensured			2
@entity21 last night thanked the thousands of supporters who helped save @entity2 ’s life and said they would do everything in their power to ensure @entity2 's happiness continues			2
founder , @entity98 , wrote on the groups @entity99 page : ‘ excellent news , @entity95 have confirmed there is no need to euthanize @entity2 immediately			0
‘ we can not thank you all enough for your incredible support as we all know what @entity2 's fate was just 2 days ago , without you all behind @entity2 this amazing sweet little dog would have had no future at all			0
thank you ! ’ the vet said it is up to @entity111 if and when they want to have @entity2 put to sleep , adding that because of a series of medical problems brought on by a physical trauma early in his life , his ‘ longevity of life ' will be ' shortened ’			1
this means @entity2 may have to be put to sleep in the future if his condition further deteriorates			2
joint effort : the successful campaign to save @entity2 attracted 9,000 supporters from across the world @entity98 said : ‘ i know that @entity2 will lead a happy life for the time being at least because we will give him everything he needs to do so			1
‘ he will have a wheelchair to help him walk and take the pressure off his back legs , physiotherapy and acupuncture			0
‘ we just do n’t know how long his life will last			0
’ she explained that as soon as @entity2 appears to be suffering , the charity will reassess his situation			2
‘ @entity2 will receive much love and care – all the things we intended to give him before he was cruelly taken away from us			0
‘ with specialist treatment , dogs with a poor prognosis like @entity2 can get amazing results , so we are still hopeful			2
’ the @entity50 said : ‘ due to the severity of @entity2 ’s condition the independent vets spoke to the police , who seized him on veterinary advice and legally signed him over to the @entity50 's care			2
‘ at the owner 's request and with the support of the @entity50 , @entity2 was taken to further independent specialist vets of the owner 's choosing			2
‘ sadly their report confirms the first vet ’s opinion that @entity2 's condition is so bad that he would never enjoy a good quality of life and the kindest option is to put him to sleep			1
‘ they said the large open sore on @entity2 ’s leg is down to the bone , could take months to heal and even then would be likely to recur			0
his double incontinence can not be cured , his back legs are chronically deformed and would only deteriorate further			0
‘ @entity2 has now been seen by a total of five independent vets , all of whom believe the kindest option is for him to be put to sleep			1
‘ however the expert veterinary advice , provided today by specialist vets from @entity76 at @entity180 , does say that whilst they would not recommend them , there are potential intensive , long - term treatment options available as long as @entity2 can be kept comfortable			1
