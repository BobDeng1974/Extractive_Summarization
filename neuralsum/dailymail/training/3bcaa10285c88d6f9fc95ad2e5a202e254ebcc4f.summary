by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 17:16 est , 8 august 2012 prisoners are being paid £ 15 a day to work in a call centre selling ‘ green ’ solar panels and home insulation to the public			1
the inmates reportedly include a killer and a fraudster , and customers will have no idea they are talking to a serving prisoner			1

instead they answer calls from people who have rung in response to adverts or following cold calling by other call centre staff			1
union leaders claim that , since the deal was struck , regular workers on full wages at the company have been fired			1
@entity43 , @entity44 regional secretary , said : ‘ this looks likes a disgraceful and worrying development			1
‘ it is nothing short of @entity49 to exploit prisoners [ in this way ] while @entity28 call centre workers lose their jobs			1
‘ this company seems to be all too readily taking advantage of cheap labour			1
not only is it fundamentally immoral but it ’s bad for the @entity20 workforce and damaging to the @entity20 economy			0
’ in total , @entity16 has taken on 23 day - release prisoners			1
of these , 12 are receiving £ 15 a day , which is to pay for food , at a rate of £ 5 for each of their three meals			0

once their work experience is over , the inmates switch to the minimum wage , which is £ 6.08 per hour for workers aged 21 and over			1
the 11 prisoners receiving the minimum wage are allowed to keep 60 per cent of what they earn , but the other 40 per cent goes into a victims ’ fund , according to the @entity85			0
@entity23 is an open prison and inmates on day release schemes will have been assessed by officials as no longer posing a risk to the public or being likely to abscond , even though their convictions are for serious offences			1
@entity94 , general secretary of the @entity95 , said that for any company to rely on cheap labour of prisoners was ‘ immoral and disgusting ’			2
but the @entity12 said it was vital to give prisoners the skills they need to get back into work if re-offending is to be reduced			2
a @entity85 spokesman said : ‘ our rules are very clear : prisoners employed by outside companies can not replace existing staff			0
they can only fill genuinely vacant posts			0
‘ @entity16 have made it clear that the prisoners they employ are filling genuinely vacant posts and that no serving members of staff have been made redundant to make way for prisoners			0
‘ the company has expanded over the past year , employing more members of the public , not less , and is still advertising			2
when the scheme started in november last year they had 100 employees , now they have more than 190 of whom just 23 are prisoners			2
‘ it is crucial that prisoners have the opportunity to learn transferable employment skills to reduce the chances of reoffending , and therefore turning them away from crime			2
’ in a statement , becoming @entity130 said : ‘ corporations should have a social responsibility to help society			1
if they work with this attitude and behaviour it will help make a better society for all			2

politicians and business leaders say the figure is a reflection of the difficult economic times			0
@entity144 mp @entity162 said : ' we hear a lot about how @entity144 is booming , but this is clearly a reflection of the wider economic situation , so there is no room for complacency			0
' ms @entity162 , a member of shopworkers union @entity169 , says retail jobs are popular with jobseekers because they offer career opportunities and flexible working hours			0
she added : ' this number of applications is a reflection of the levels of unemployment - there is not a lot of choice around			0
' dr @entity182 , chief economist at @entity183 , said : ' it is no surprise that @entity143 had 2,168 applicants for 15 jobs , given that the business is successful , growing and has a high profile as both a tv advertiser and a large retail outlet			0
