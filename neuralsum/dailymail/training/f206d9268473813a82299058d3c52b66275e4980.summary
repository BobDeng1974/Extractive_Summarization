' that has indeed occurred with the disastrous consequences we , and so many young men 's families , now live with			0
' the judge said that @entity18 had been ' living a lie ' having cultivated an image of himself as a ' teacher or scholar ' and projected an image to the younger members of the group of ' being some sort of elder who could advise and guide them			0
' the judge said that while @entity18 was not the leader of the group , ' there is no doubt in my mind that you , as the older man , encouraged them to remain committed to their plan and in due course you were even suggesting routes for them			2

' ' that 's why i wanted to go to @entity8 , ' he said			2

' is n't being a @entity94 the best thing ever ? ... the life of this world is nothing but a sweet poison that quenches the thirst of desire and drags the ungrateful soul deeper into @entity352 ! ' @entity18 's wife only found out about his lies when the trial opened			2
she gave evidence for the defence , saying : ' these messages , he 's absolutely barmy , he 's gone mad , he says things like this out of the blue , it 's ridiculous , ridiculous ... it p * * * es me off so much			0
