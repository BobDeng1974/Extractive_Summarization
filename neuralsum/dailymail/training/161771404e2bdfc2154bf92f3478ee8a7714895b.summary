yesterday , coroner @entity49 , who recorded a narrative verdict at @entity51 , criticised the girl 's secondary school for failing to deal with complaints of bullying			2
addressing the circumstances of @entity3 's death , he said : ' from her texts , it is clear she believed him ( the boy ) to have a video which she begged him delete			1
' she was highly distressed			0
i am satisfied that @entity3 felt so desperate and hopeless that , at about 8pm , she decided to do something dramatic to try to force @entity23 into doing what she wanted			1
' @entity3 climbed out on the window ledge and attempted to demonstrate to him she would jump if he did not do as she asked			1
' but he added that he did not believe the youngster meant to die , saying ' on the balance of probabilities , she lost her balance and fell '			2
he added : ' if she jumped , i do not accept that she formed any settled intention to kill herself			2
' the coroner criticised @entity76 's school and @entity79 's children 's services team for ' a catalogue of failings '			0
the pupil had told teachers she had been sexually assaulted twice by different boys in february 2011 , a month before her death			1

she said a second boy – @entity23 – then threatened to smash @entity93 's windows if she did not repeat the act on him the following day			0
the fall : a coroner today ruled that @entity93 's 60ft fall from her bedroom window on the top floor of this block of flats in @entity6 was a ' ghastly ' accident and not intentional @entity3 did not realise that this second episode was being filmed			1
she discovered a sex tape had been made and was being passed around the school only four hours before her death , the court heard			1
mr @entity108 accepted @entity3 did have sexual encounters with both men			2

' tragic : the girl 's mother @entity37 , left , has spoken of her heartbreak at the death of @entity3 , right both boys – neither of whom went to her school – testified at the inquest but denied engaging in sexual activity with the teenager			1

the inquest heard the teenager had been targeted by bullies since she was 11			0
mr @entity108 said there had been ' clear failings ' at the school and by social services to give her the support she needed			0
