a medical student claims to have cured himself of a debilitating disease by taking up smoking			2
formerly a non-smoker , @entity3 , 23 , struggled with crippling pain , tiredness , shortness of breath and dehydration since he was diagnosed with bowel disease ulcerative colitis four years ago			1
he had to rush to the toilet up to 15 times a day but is now completely symptom - free , thanks to a new four - a - day cigarette habit			1
no more discomfort ? @entity3 claims to have completely cured his debilitating bowel condition by starting a four - a - day cigarette habit the incredible turnaround is due to a side - effect of nicotine , hardly known outside medical circles , which cancels out damage caused by the disease			1
the trainee pharmacologist from @entity24 , south @entity25 , who had never previously smoked , defied doctors ’ recommendations of invasive surgery in favour of studies which showed patients with the disease improving after being given nicotine			1
he said : ' @entity35 was my last option			0
i did n’t really want to wear a colostomy bag at the age of 23			0
' @entity39 is a condition which is constantly on your mind			0
it holds you back from doing a lot of things			0
' now , thanks to smoking , i do not suffer with the symptoms anymore and i can finally move on with my life			2
' i know it ’s controversial to say smoking can have positive effects , but doctors do n’t always know best			2
' mr @entity3 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in february 2008 and was forced to give up university following repeated visits to hospital			1
dr @entity57 , @entity58 at @entity59 , has written on the link between nicotine and colitis in the @entity63			2
he said : ' it is a well - established medical fact that smoking protects against ulcerative colitis			1
' it is not widely - known outside specialised medical circles , and raises eyebrows in patients and other doctors when explained , but the treatment is well - known among those familiar with this condition			1
' rarely , we use tobacco as a bridge to conventional medical therapy			0
' we sometimes get an ex-smoker to start smoking again - for a short period - to settle the colitis and then allow medicines , such as azathioprine , to maintain remission after they have stopping smoking completely			1
' this has worked in two out of three cases which i have personally dealt with			0
' dr @entity57 added it is common for ulcerative colitis to be found in patients who have recently stopped smoking			1
he said : ' the condition is three times more common in people who have given up or who never started smoking			0
we do not know why			0
' but other doctors believe nicotine is the healer so research into the benefits of wearing nicotine patches , and not smoking cigarettes , are the way forward			1
he said : ' it was so bad i was taken on a stretcher into hospital where i stayed for three days			0
after that my mum persuaded me to go back home and get better			0
' despite struggling with symptoms , he re-sat his a-levels and began a new course in pharmacology at @entity121			0
doctors prescribed drugs which are usually used to help chemotherapy patients , but he found the side - effects unbearable			1
then , in april this year , he read a study in which half of ulcerative colitis sufferers who took part in a trial experienced complete relief from symptoms when using a nicotine patch			1
he said : ' i had really bad headaches and i was really run - down on the medication			0
' i found that smoking was quite a well recommended method in @entity140 , and decided to give it a try			0
' cigarettes , rather than patches , were the best option for me to get the nicotine			1
patches are n’t routinely available on the @entity147 for this treatment and they are too expensive for me to buy			0
' i am only smoking four cigarettes a day so i can make a one pack last for several days , meaning it works out cheaper			1
' as a student , everyone in my shared house smokes , so smoking cigarettes was a natural thing to do			2
' within a week of starting smoking all of my symptoms disappeared			2
' despite well - known links between cigarette smoking and cancer , mr @entity3 balanced the decision to take up the habit against equally well - established links between ulcerative colitis and bowel cancer			1
he said : ' the colitis , and the drugs used to treat it , can themselves cause cancer			0
' i ’m only smoking three or four cigarettes a day , so i do n’t believe i am at risk			2
' dr @entity57 , @entity58 at @entity59 , who has written on the subject in the @entity63 , said : ' it is a well - established medical fact that smoking protects against ulcerative colitis			1
' rarely , we use tobacco as a bridge to conventional medical therapy			0
' we sometimes get an ex-smoker to start smoking again - for a short period - to settle the colitis and then allow medicines , such as azathioprine , to maintain remission after they have stopping smoking completely			1

he said : ' the condition is three times more common in people who have given up or who never started smoking			0
we do not know why			0
' around 20 years ago there was a lot of interest in using nicotine patches to treat ulcerative colitis , but the research was not terribly effective			1
' but @entity210 , director of information at the @entity211 and @entity212 , said cigarette smoking is not a safe treatment			2
she said : ' the recommendation of the medical advisors we work with is that although smoking has a known effect on ulcerative colitis , the general advice is to give up smoking			1
' in terms of maintaining general health , not smoking is better for you than smoking			0
' and @entity226 , director of research and policy at charity @entity228 said : ' the evidence does n’t come from smoking , it comes from nicotine			2
' there are ways of getting safe pharmacological nicotine in patches			2
we advise talking to a doctor about the benefits of going on nicotine replacement therapy			2
' there is no need to try smoking which is , of course , very dangerous			0

@entity3 , 23 , struggled with crippling pain , tiredness , shortness of breath and dehydration since he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago
but he is now completely symptom - free , thanks to a new four - a - day cigarette habit
doctors are divided over benefits of patients smoking to combat symptoms - some believe nicotine is the healer so patches , and not cigarettes , are way forward
