three years later , she was hired by @entity27 to turn around the languishing @entity3 and it became her bully pulpit for the next 32 years			1

' on leaving her post in 1997 , she said : ' it was a terrific magazine			2
i would want my legacy to be , " she created something that helped people			2

' bad girls go everywhere , the 2009 biography of @entity2 by @entity101 , a women 's studies professor , argued that her message of empowerment made @entity2 a feminist even if the movement did n't recognize her as such			1
