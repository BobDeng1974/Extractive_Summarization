researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes			1
they say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome , a word used to describe the different realms of life on @entity9			0
researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice - free land , or about 247,000 square miles , almost the size of @entity14			1
the various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched , with sparse studies of rodents and @entity22 cockroaches , researchers say			1
a study of 40 houses in @entity25 used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants			1
it found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa			1
another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods , including insects and spiders an examination of 11 houses in @entity39 found a great variety of fungus among us			1
a review paper published march 19 in the journal @entity44 serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution			0
the various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched , with sparse studies of rodents and @entity22 cockroaches , for example , from the pest management field , or public health perspectives on microbes			1
the paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment , which included evolutionary , microbial and plant biologists , entomologists , architects , scientists who study better building design , and others			2
' people have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap , ' said @entity75 of @entity76 , the paper 's first author			2
' but given the number of species found indoors , it is likely there 's a lot more going on that we do n't know about			1

' i 've been noticing more species inside my house since i went to this working group , ' @entity104 said , referring to the 2013 workshop			2
co-author @entity109 , of @entity110 , discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house			2
' the radical diversity in abiotic environments , such as in water heaters , freezers and on kitchen counters , is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors , ' said @entity104			0
the paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today 's indoor environments most closely resemble caves			0
the emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution , as the development of human - built environments has been recent			0
@entity132 : researchers called for more research into pests , saying the home was an untapped resource			0

' people have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap , ' said @entity75 , the paper 's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources			0
researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution - such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them ; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species			1
they also hope to compare species in @entity162 , for example , with species in @entity14 ; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors ; which indoor species are healthful to have ; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions			0
' we are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses , ' @entity104 said .			0

researchers say homes are a *hotbed* of *undiscovered* species

11 houses in @entity39 revealed a great variety of fungus among us
