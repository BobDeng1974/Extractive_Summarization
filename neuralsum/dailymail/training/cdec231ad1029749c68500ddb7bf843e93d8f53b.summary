by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 2 april 2013 more than four fifths of @entity4 teenagers are at risk from heart disease thanks to their unhealthy diets , a study has revealed			1
while young people may not believe that their current lifestyle will have a long - term impact on their health , researchers say that there is a strong link between childhood behaviour and the long - term outlook for people 's hearts			1
and more than 80 per cent are classified as having ' poor ' diets , with just one in hundred eating the recommended level of healthy foods			1
long - term : childhood behaviour can have an effect on adult health , according to researchers ( file photo ) the study by the @entity30 was aimed at identifying young people who might be in danger of developing heart problems			1
it tested 4,673 @entity4 between the ages of 12 and 19 for their blood pressure , cholesterol , body mass index , blood glucose , diet , exercise levels and smoking habits			1
healthy diet proved by far the most worrying category , with the vast majority of subjects eating a poor mix of food groups			2
scientists recommend eating at least 4.5 cups of fruit of vegetable a day , as well at 3oz of whole grain and no more than 1,500mg			0
across the course of a week , young people should have at least two servings of fish and no more than 450 calories of sugary drinks - but only one per cent manage to fulfil all those conditions			2
danger : the vast majority of teenagers prefer fast food to healthy snacks @entity66 , a researcher at the @entity67 who is lead author of the @entity30 study , described the findings on diet as ' far less than optimal '			0
she added that the @entity4 's youth obesity epidemic is ' influencing worsening rates of high blood pressure , high cholesterol and blood glucose at these young ages '			2
the situation is less dire when it comes to teenagers ' exercise , but it is still worrying as just 67 per cent of boys and 44 per cent of girls engage in recommended levels of physical activity			0
and the toll of unhealthy lifestyles is already showing on adolescents , as a third have cholesterol levels rated as intermediate or poor			0
overall , fewer than half of those in the study reached acceptable levels in at least five of the seven risk factors			0
although nearly all children are born with hearts which are perfectly healthy , it can take just a few years for an unhealthy lifestyle to manifest itself in the body			0
the researchers write in the study , published in the journal @entity105 , that autopsies conducted on children as young as six have for decades shown ' fatty streaks in the large arteries ' as a result of poor diet			0
' the status of heart health during childhood has been shown to be a strong predictor of heart health in adulthood , ' dr @entity113 concluded			1
' members of the medical and scientific community , parents , teachers and legislators all need to focus their efforts on the prevention and improvement of all aspects of cardiovascular health - particularly optimal physical activity levels and diet - as early in life as possible , beginning at birth			2

childhood lifestyle can affect long - term heart health
more than 80 *%* of @entity4 teens have ' poor ' diets
