austerity - hit @entity1 is spending a larger share of its wealth on foreign aid than any other @entity6 member nation , despite making huge spending cuts at home , a report revealed yesterday			1
the @entity6 ' accountability ' review showed that between 2011 and 2012 several countries decided to rein in their foreign aid budgets			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15 chose to focus on helping their own citizens , handing out a smaller percentage of their national income than the year before			1
@entity14 was even given a ' red light ' warning for failing to meet ' internationally agreed targets '			0
but cash - strapped @entity1 spent 0.56 per cent of national income on aid against 0.19 per cent in the @entity15 and just 0.03 per cent in @entity25			1
the report , published as @entity32 hosted the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , will renew complaints that @entity1 's aid commitments make us the ' soft touch ' of the international community			1
@entity54 , leader of the @entity1 @entity55 , said : ' these figures prove that the government wishes to burnish its moral credentials at the expense of ordinary taxpayers			2
' @entity1 's foreign aid budget is rising while hospital accident and emergency departments , libraries and other public services are being cut back or closed			1
' @entity67 mp for @entity68 , @entity69 , a longstanding critic of the government 's foreign aid commitments , said : ' other countries are making more sensible decisions about their priorities given the tough economic times we are in			1
we are now the mugs of the world			0
we 're spending money we have n't got			0
' they are making sure their spending across the board is being cut , not just on domestic things			0
i 'm afraid it proves that our argument that if we do it everyone else will follow suit is just pure humbug			0
' mr @entity69 also rejected mr @entity32 's argument that @entity1 's lead on aid boosted its standing on the world stage			1
' we 'd be chairing the @entity6 whether or not we were giving this amount of money , ' he insisted			0
' it is a nonsensical argument			0
the truth is the prime minister made a promise he should not have made			0
' he has now boxed himself in but he should be brave enough to say he made it in good faith but the economic situation is now so much more tough and more difficult than anyone anticipated that he has to react			0
' the @entity1 's aid spending stood at 0.56 per cent of national income in 2011/12 , or £ 8.55billion , rising to £ 8.813billion in 2012/13			1
but the total is soaring this year to £ 11.554billion , or 0.7 per cent of national income , and will go up to £ 12.162billion in 2014/15			2
shake : mr @entity28 and mr @entity35 staged a show of unity at a @entity6 press conference last night , despite deep divisions over how to end the slaughter in @entity115 @entity116 , of the @entity117 , said : ' it 's absurd that the @entity1 continues to increase the size of its aid budget far faster than the rest of the @entity6 despite the huge financial pressures at home			2
' if the @entity125 made better use of its existing budget and cut out lots of waste and bureaucracy , ministers could achieve even more abroad without increasing the burden on hard - pressed @entity1 families			2
' countries in far better economic health are n't spending anywhere near as much of their national income on overseas aid , so it beggars belief that our government is still hiking the amount of our money it is committing			1
' however @entity144 , from the if campaign against global hunger , said : ' @entity1 governments deserve real credit for delivering aid increases that have helped save millions of lives			2
' but with one in eight people in the world going hungry it is high time that other countries also stepped up to the mark and provided the cash they have promised			2
' last week , mr @entity32 attempted to justify @entity1 's aid spending , insisting : ' national interest is not just about standing up for yourself but standing up for what 's right			1
' when a country like @entity165 fractures and breaks , that affects us , not just in the terrorism threatened on our streets , or the flows of mass immigration but in the piracy off the @entity173 that affects @entity1 trade			0
' when there is instability in the @entity178 it affects us too – because 100,000 @entity1 citizens live there			0
' on the other hand , as nations develop and as their middle class grows – that presents huge opportunities for an exporter like @entity1			0
' we made the decision to protect the aid budget because i believe this commitment is in @entity1 's long - term interests			1
yes , this is a moral issue , but it is an economic one too			0

between 2011 and 2012 several countries reined in foreign aid budgets
but cash - strapped @entity1 did n't and spends 0.56 *%* of national income
@entity1 's aid make us the ' soft touch ' of the international community
