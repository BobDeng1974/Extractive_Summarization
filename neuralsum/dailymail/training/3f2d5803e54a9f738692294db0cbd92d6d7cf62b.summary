@entity0 made it two wins from two in the @entity3 as they produced a five - goal blitz to crush @entity5 on wednesday afternoon			1
after an even first half , @entity8 ’s strike just before half - time triggered an avalanche of goals , with @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 all getting on the scoresheet			1
the comprehensive win at @entity18 in @entity19 followed up the @entity20 ’ 2 - 0 success at @entity22 on matchday one and put them in firm control of their group			1
@entity0 's @entity8 prepares to pull the trigger and score @entity0 's first goal against @entity5 @entity8 's shot heads towards the target as @entity5 defender @entity31 tries in vain to block @entity0 's @entity13 tries to get the better of the grounded @entity33 during the first half @entity0 : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 67 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 74 ) ; @entity42 , @entity15 , @entity8 ; @entity14 ( c ) , @entity12 ( @entity43 80 ) , @entity13 subs not used : @entity46 ( gk ) , @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 scorers : @entity8 45 ; @entity12 58 ; @entity13 59 ; @entity14 66 ; @entity15 ( pen ) 70 @entity5 : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 ; @entity57 ( @entity58 84 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 57 ) ; @entity61 ( @entity62 67 ) , @entity63 ; @entity64 subs not used : @entity66 ( gk ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 scorer : @entity62 90 booked : @entity56 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) @entity0 started the match on the front foot with early opportunities for @entity12 and @entity15 though both were a little too high with their efforts			1
it was one - way traffic for much of the half as @entity0 penned their @entity82 visitors in and @entity15 came within inches when he ran on to @entity14 ’s pass and rattled the crossbar from 20 yards			1
but just as it looked as though the sides would return to the dressing rooms scoreless , @entity8 set off on a run from just inside the @entity5 half and darted into the open space in front of him			2
the @entity95 youth international then cut inside a defender and fired past @entity97 in goal			0
the goal seemed to break @entity5 ’s spirit and it took just 12 minutes of the second half for @entity0 to gain their second			2
@entity40 made progress down the left - hand side and squared for @entity106 to tap - in			0
a minute later and the contest was definitely settled when @entity13 fired home from 10 yards out and a fourth came shortly afterwards as @entity109 found the net from the edge of the box following @entity15 ’s assist			0
@entity15 gets the better of @entity56 's unorthodox challenge the highly - rated @entity15 deserved a goal and he got one from the penalty spot after being challenged illegally in the box			0
@entity118 did gain a late consolation for the visitors but it took none of the gloss off a fine @entity0 display			0
the @entity20 will seal their passage to the knockout round if they get the better of @entity127 in their next two matches			0
@entity12 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity0 's second goal with @entity40			2
