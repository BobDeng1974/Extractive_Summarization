by @entity0 a 17 stone woman who was ' mortified ' by her holiday pictures vowed to shed her extra weight and did so in spectacular fashion - dropping seven stone and completing a beach babe transformation			2
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 went on a trip to @entity10 , @entity11 , with her friends last year and felt she looked ' slim and nice ' - but her photographs told a different story			1
the former @entity16 sales assistant tipped the scales at 16 stone 11lbs and seeing how large she had become was a shock			2
@entity7 on a trip to @entity10 with her friends last year ( l ) and after her transformation in just a year ( r ) since @entity7 began a strict diet programme her weight has plummeted seven stone - and she is turning heads wherever she goes , weighing a svelte 10 stone			1
thrilled @entity7 said : ' i was mortified when i saw the holiday photographs			1
i honestly did n't realise how big i was until seeing them			0
' i 'm going to @entity29 this year so the bikinis will be coming out and there will be no covering up			2
' i will be showing of my body now i 'm able to fit into smaller clothes			0
' i have always been a shy girl but in @entity10 i never wore a bikini because i looked huge			1
i did n't realise i looked so big , though			2
' going out of a night i never really got attention , i just wore t - shirt and shorts on the beach and in the night long dresses to cover up			2
' @entity7 would binge eat on junk food like crisps , cakes , fizzy drinks and sweets to make herself feel better			1
@entity45 was horrified by her holiday snaps and seeing how big she was was the final straw before she took action in a typical day , the brunette would tuck into a @entity52 or chocolate bar for breakfast , her lunch would be a sandwich , chocolate biscuits with @entity56 and tea would be pizza			2
confidence boost : @entity7 says she enjoys the attention her new body shape brings after every evening meal , which was always something ' quick and easy ' , like a microwave meal , she would gorge herself on ice cream and puddings			1
but the 5ft 5in beauty ballooned to an unhealthy weight and fatty foods began to take their toll on @entity7 's body			1
three years ago , she had to have her gall bladder removed because her diet of junk food caused gall stones			0
after seeing the holiday photos she finally joined slimming plan @entity76 - and is now a brand distributor			2
@entity7 said : ' @entity79 have a range of foods , like protein bars , vitamins and formulas for milkshakes to fight the flab			1
the @entity88 shakes have all the nutrition your body needs to get you through the day			0
' i did the plan because it fits in with my lifestyle if i â€™m on the go i can just take my shake with me or my healthy snacks			0
' i lost the weight because i was depressed and ashamed of how i looked			0
i hated going into shops and having to buy bigger sizes it was embarrassing			0
i also knew i needed to lose the weight for my health and after seeing holiday snaps from @entity10 i knew i had to take action in getting into shape			1
' morning : a biscuit - something quick lunch time : a sandwich and crisps dinner time : microwave meal with a side or pizza and garlic bread snacks : crisps , cakes , biscuit , @entity56 morning : @entity121 shake and beverage @entity122 - morning : fruit or a protein @entity126 : shake with tea @entity128 - afternoon : fruit or a protein bar or a small healthy snack and @entity134 time : chicken or fish with veg * shakes are a large part of the diet until target weight is reached			0
they are then used to help maintain			0
she said : ' i was depressed had no social life because i was too scared of what people would think of me			0
i never talked to boys because i thought they would not like me because of my weight			0
' i hated going out the shop and having to buy size 20 clothing so i would just binge eat to make the feelings go away - but obviously things got worse , a lot worse			1
' i used to be a size 18 to 20 but now i can just pick up a size 10 without trying it on , i feel like a new woman			1
' when i walk down the street or i 'm out in town boys i can see boys looking at me , they never used to and it 's nice			0
' i do n't have a boyfriend yet though but i 've got a better chance at a relationship now i 'm not so overweight - so i 'm sure it 's only a matter of time			0
' @entity7 will stop having @entity121 products every day on her strict diet regime when she reaches her target weight of nine - and - a - half stone			1
she then plans to continue to eat healthy months - and use the shakes or low fat snacks to help hr maintain her new weight			0
she was a size 18 to 20 but now can just pick up a size 10 without trying it on			1
