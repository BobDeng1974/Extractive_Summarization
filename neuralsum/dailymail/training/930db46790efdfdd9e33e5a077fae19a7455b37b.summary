published : 14:17 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 03:07 est , 21 september 2012 once banned by christian missionaries as a barbaric , heathen custom , traditional tattooing is making a comeback in the @entity4 as locals in the @entity7 nation reconnect with their cultural roots			1
body art was common in @entity7 nations such as the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 before missionaries arrived in the @entity16 -- so much so that the @entity18 word tattoo is derived from the @entity21 terms ' tatau ' and ' tatatau '			1
@entity23 with bone or shell chisels , tattoos were a rite of passage for @entity21 men and paintings from the the early days of @entity30 contact show muscular warriors with elaborate designs covering much of their bodies			2
a tattooist uses a traditional method to tattoo @entity36 during an exhibition in @entity39 ' if you were out in a waka ( canoe ) and came across another boat , you could tell from their tattoos where those guys came from , ' said @entity47 , who runs a tattoo studio at the back of @entity50 in the capital @entity52			2
' you could identify whether they were from @entity12 or wherever			0
more specifically , if you were among that group , you could tell which island they came from , right down to their family line and genealogy			0
' @entity36 lies down as assistants hold his skin tight while master tattooist @entity62 tattoos him @entity62 , who is descended from a line of master @entity14 tattooists , visited the @entity67 in @entity68 in september to demonstrate the ancient techniques			0
among those he tattooed was @entity36 , who lay prone on a mat as @entity72 carved into his skin the precise geometric lines of a pe'a sogaimiti , a design that scrolls from the upper waist to the knees			0
betraying only the occasional wince of pain as the club cracked against the chisel , @entity36 held his wife 's hand while @entity72 worked , assisted by four men , one to stretch the skin , another to wipe away the blood and the others holding @entity88 's limbs still			0
a master tattooist cracks a club against a chisel to carve the pe'a sogaimiti , a design that scrolls from the upper waist to the knees @entity72 welcomed the tattoo revival in the @entity4 and said a similar phenomenon was occurring in @entity12 , where his father was helping teach locals traditional techniques			1
author @entity100 , whose history of @entity4 tattooing ' patterns of the past ' was published last year , said missionaries took @entity106 warnings against marking the body literally , and zealously set about banning tattoos			1
in the @entity4 , anyone who received a tattoo was fined or given punishment work details under rules imposed by church authorities , @entity100 said			0
' it was seen as very shameful and against @entity115 , ' she said			0
' there 's evidence in the archives that some tattoos were physically removed and scraped off people 's bodies with pieces of coral			0
' the result , with the exception of @entity14 and @entity68 , was a form of cultural amnesia across @entity128 , where traditional tattooing virtually died out			1
traditional tattooing is making a comeback in the @entity4 as locals try to reconnect with their cultural roots many once - revered designs were lost and the ancient technique of applying tattoos by striking an ink - soaked bone chisel with a wooden club resembling a spatula was no longer practiced			1
@entity100 said interest in tattooing revived in the cooks in the 1990s as part of a broader cultural movement which involved locals rediscovering their heritage through traditional arts and crafts			1
@entity147 , one of the few tattooists in the island nation now practicing the traditional technique , said that while some designs had been lost forever , others survived through carving , weaving and tapa ( bark cloth art )			1
@entity147 said body art was a type of language in @entity128 and tattooists underwent a lengthy apprenticeship before being considered worthy of working on traditional designs with a chisel and club			1
@entity36 's right leg is tattooed by @entity62 using a chisel and club to make the traditional design he said the growing popularity of @entity21 designs among @entity171 had led to concerns about tattooists in @entity30 stealing artwork they had seen on the internet simply for its aesthetic appeal , with no regard for its cultural meaning			2
' when a person gives you their skin , it 's an unusual relationship of trust , ' he said			0
' you do n't want to stuff it up			0
' it has to reflect the tradition of their family line or island			0
that comes with a lot of responsibility			0
' tattooists undergo a long apprenticeship before being considered worthy of working on traditional designs not all efforts to suppress tattooing were successful , the practice remains strong among @entity201 and receiving a customary design is still regarded as an important step on the passage to manhood in @entity14			1
@entity205 said he believes the missionaries opposed tattooing because it is a bloody , painful process when performed with customary tools , but said it was such an integral part of @entity14 culture that the church was unable to stop it there			1
@entity72 said he could not understand why the missionaries worked so vigorously elsewhere in @entity128 to stop a practice that he regards as a vital part of the region 's cultural identity			2
' for me , to be able to pass down this knowledge and art from generation to generation , it 's a gift from @entity225 , ' he said .			2
