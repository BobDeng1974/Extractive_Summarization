doctors told him he was lucky to be alive but he was paralysed from the waist down and would never walk again			1
but now , thanks to the @entity2 ’s first highly advanced bionic splints , he has defied all the odds to run - after just three weeks of having them			1
@entity22 said : ' for the first time in seven years not only can i stand still - but i can run			1
“ it was an absolutely wonderful feeling to just give it a go and i have n’t stopped since			1
it is just great to be as normal as i can be			2
' i said to my wife i ’ll have to sign myself up for a fun run , or something			0
' it ’s fair to say i ’m not going to be the next @entity32 , but you never know			0
' @entity22 joined the 2nd @entity35 in 1999 , aged 19			0
he was a month into his tour in the @entity38 district in 2007 when he was attacked during an arrest and detain mission			0
the gunfire from a sniper narrowly missed his head before he was shot in the spine by a bullet that ' felt like a sledgehammer			2
@entity1 ’s best friend corporal @entity47 , 30 , heard him scream ' man down ' and ran back 40 yards - under heavy fire - to retrieve him			1
he dragged @entity50 to within just a few metres of safety when he was fatally struck in the chest with a bullet			0
he went down , dragging me with him , ' recalls @entity55 , from @entity56 , @entity57			0
' i whispered his name and when there was nothing from him i knew he was dead			0
from then on i was on my own			0

the gunfire from a sniper narrowly missed his head before he was shot in the spine by a bullet , leaving him paralysed			1
he is pictured right in rehabilitation he then endured a six - hour operation at the field hospital at @entity74 to repair his internal organs which had been ripped apart by the bullet			2
within days , he was flown to @entity79 ’s @entity78 hospital , and then on to @entity80 where doctors said he would never walk again			0
but he soon regained feeling in some of his upper leg muscles and , just eight weeks later , he defied them with a few very shaky steps out of the hospital , spurred on by the memory of his best friend who saved his life			1
@entity55 was funded by @entity89 so the charity can analyse his progress in a bid to convince the government to fund other paralysed patients in 2010 @entity95 was fitted with conventional splints , but the ill - fitting devices would cut and bruise his legs			1
the constant pain meant he could only wear them for a few hours at a time			0
even when he did wear them , he had to constantly move around to stop himself toppling over - and was often confined to a wheelchair			2
then , this year @entity89 put him forward for the new prosthetics , called exo - skeleton orthotics			1
the £ 5,000 futuristic fibreglass leg casts - funded by the charity - store energy from @entity1 ’s working muscles in his upper legs to propel his lower legs forward when he steps			1
they slide into his shoes and round his legs below the knee			2
' the first night i got them i wanted to wear them to bed , i did n’t want to take them off , ' said @entity55 , who is married to @entity118 , 32			0
' the independence they have given me is amazing			0
