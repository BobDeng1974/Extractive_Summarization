by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 10 october 2013 the @entity1 will take a decade to close the ‘ skills gap ’ with other countries because too few students study science , engineering and maths			1
so - called @entity9 subjects - science , technology , engineering and maths - are essential to keep pace in the technological race that fuels the global economy today			1
but 59 per cent of employers and 71 per cent of universities said there are n’t enough people being trained to the standard needed - and predicted it would take at least ten years to tackle the problem			1
the @entity1 needs 10 years to bring science , technology , engineering and maths training to the level it requires to thrive			1
file picture an overwhelming majority in both groups agreed the deficit had to be addressed for the @entity1 to remain competitive			1
the survey followed a damning report earlier this week which showed @entity34 is the only developed country where 16 - 24 - year - olds are worse at maths and @entity34 than their grandparents			0
graduates from @entity34 universities are also less advanced than school leavers in some countries including @entity43 , according to the @entity44			1
the report - which warned @entity34 was falling behind global competitors - destroyed @entity47 ’s record on education during 13 years in power			0
researchers even backed critics who said rising exam results had been caused by grade inflation rather than improving standards			1
further damage was done yesterday by @entity58 figures which revealed sixth forms and colleges had been failing pupils by allowing them to drop maths and @entity34 before they have achieved a decent grade at @entity64			0
deficit : a total of 71 per cent of universities said there aren ¿ t enough people being trained to the standard needed in maths , 93 per cent of those without a c by the time they finished secondary school had still not achieved the grade by 18 if they stayed in education			1
some 83 per cent were not made to continue the subject			0
the figures in @entity34 were 92 per cent and 85 per cent respectively			0
education secretary @entity81 tackled the issue last month by announcing teenagers would have to keep trying to get a c in both subjects until they were 18			0
more than half of the 300 businesses and 24 leading @entity89 academics who took part in the @entity9 survey said more money needed to be invested in teaching the subjects			0
they also called for closer collaboration between industry and academia to improve take - up and for industry to have a greater say in the curriculum			0
the number of undergraduates studying @entity9 subjects was 632,000 in 2011/12 , an increase of 13.6 per cent over five years			0
but a report by the @entity109 think - tank earlier this year said this was not enough to meet demand			2
an extra 40,000 graduates were needed each year to meet the 100,000 vacancies being created by the ageing workforce , it added			2
dr @entity116 of computer software developer @entity117 , which commissioned the @entity9 survey , said : ‘ this report tells us two important things			0
‘ first , that more needs to be done to encourage students to study @entity9 subjects in tertiary education			2
‘ second , that @entity9 curricula need to better reflect the requirements of industry , bearing in mind that during their careers students will need to solve problems that are not yet known , using technologies that have n’t been invented yet			2
’ demand from universities for students to study traditional subjects has led to an increase in applications to read subjects such as maths and science			1
the @entity141 has also set up a £ 200 million fund to boost science and engineering departments , under which universities are expected to match the funding			2
a @entity147 spokeswoman said : ‘ it is vital the @entity1 has the skills we need to ensure our businesses stay ahead in the global race			1
that is why we recently announced a £ 400 million investment in world - class science and technology facilities and teaching for university students			2
‘ we are also encouraging more people to study @entity9 subjects at high level by reversing the rules which stopped them getting financial support to retrain in engineering and technology part - time			0

core skills are vital to developing @entity1 economy
but employers and universities says students do *n't* meet standards
