by @entity1 reporter published : 08:09 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 10:18 est , 25 january 2013 any music lover of a certain age will remember proudly swinging one of these iconic carrier bags on their arm after their saturday morning visit to a record shop			1
after hours of trawling the shelves for the latest single on 45 inch vinyl or cassette tapes , teenagers would rush home to their bedrooms and listen to the eagerly awaited tracks			0
but as the world of internet downloads and online stores took over the music industry , the traditional record shops and their iconic bags have almost become a relic of the past			0
these pictures show a collection of 1970s shopping bags from some of the biggest record stores in @entity30 - many of which are sadly no longer in existence			1
record shop bags were a big thing in the 1970s , when every @entity34 had a record store			1
pictured is @entity38 's popular bag a retro record bag shop for @entity40 , which traded in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 our @entity45 was a prominent chain of record stores seen on all @entity49			1
it was founded in 1971 but went to the wall in 2004 familiar ones includes @entity53 - one of the few stores still in business			0
there is also @entity38 , which will soon join the list of closed stores after going into administration after nearly 100 years of trading earlier this month			0
the shopping bags were commonplace in a world where teens were only ever destined for one place on a saturday morning - the record shop			1
grasping hard - earned pocket money , they would head for @entity38 , and if it did n't have what they wanted , our @entity45 was next on the list			1
although still a permanent fixture of the @entity34 , @entity73 no longer sells cds the epitome of cool : carrying around a bag full of newly - purchased records was considered a cool fashion accessory the @entity81 , pictured left , had a store in @entity84 while @entity85 , pictured right , was popular with teens in @entity87 @entity88 was founded in 1969 in @entity89 , @entity90 , and continued trading right up until 2003 as the stores themselves have disappeared over the years , their carrier bags have become collector 's items and attract hundreds of bids on @entity98 from music lovers			1
this rare collection of bags are a stark reminder of how the evolution of the music industry has impacted on @entity30 ’s high streets			1
the increased popularity of websites like @entity108 and @entity109 has impacted heavily on our high streets			0
despite a proud history of being the most popular record store , @entity38 has struggled over the past few years from fierce supermarket and online competition			1
its flagship store and the first ever @entity38 - @entity116 - was opened by the @entity118 on @entity119 in 1921			2
a bag from @entity121 , a @entity30 record label which started in the 1990s and still trades from a store in @entity123 in @entity124 the bags came in many different shapes , styles and forms			2
pictured left is a brown paper carrier from @entity131 , which traded in @entity132 and a white and blue paper record bag from @entity134 in @entity135 , right this bright red bag would have made heads turn , from the @entity123 records centre ltd over the years , the company went from strength to strength and stores were opened in almost every town across the country			0
everyone in @entity30 would be able to recognise its logo of the @entity148 listening to a cylinder phonograph - painted by 1899 by @entity150			0
but the music and film retailer was not quick enough to embrace the shift to shoppers buying their movies and albums over the internet			0
now the nation ’s last specialist record and cd retailer has been forced to call in the administrators			0
@entity162 , the record company which signed @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 and which owned @entity38 until 1998 , has already been sold to foreign buyers and broken up			2
very soon the only place where record store shops still exist will be online			2
a red and white retro record bag from the @entity171 in @entity172 harlequin records and tapes had branches throughout @entity124 and the @entity176 @entity178 era : independent records stores such as robins records in @entity181 are a thing of the past changing times : @entity184 records is another @entity34 chain to go under when buying records in stores gradually became replaced by online downloads punk rockers : @entity190 was founded in 1976 and was best known for its punk rock music			0
but as the punk rock era passed , so did the record label 's popularity and it closed in 1985 long history : the nation 's last specialist record and cd retailer - @entity38 - has gone into administration almost 100 years since it was first founded in 1921			2

*nostalgic* images include carrier bags from @entity38 , our @entity45 and @entity73
record shop bags were a style accessory for many *youngsters* in the 1970s
this rare collection of record store shopping bags - many of which are no longer in business - shows how the @entity34 has changed
