by @entity0 the £ 16,000 - a - night penthouse suite and the infinity pool just above it are n’t quite ready , but @entity3 on the 48th floor is open for business			1
it ’s perfect for anyone looking to go up in the world			2
but not recommended if you ’re scared of heights			2
this is the highest hotel room in @entity12 and i ’m the first to sleep in it			1
called the @entity15 it ’s finally opened in the shard next to the @entity18 in central @entity19 , almost a year behind schedule and still a work in progress			1
and it ’s sensational in more ways than the @entity25 owners might have wanted			1
however , as @entity0 discovered , visitors can often see straight into neighbouring rooms because of a design fault a pair of binoculars sits on the desk but the view hardly needs any amplification			2
@entity37 , to the east , looks like it belongs in a toy - town miniature village , while @entity57 just about holds its own to the west , with the river snaking through the capital , passing the @entity61 , @entity39 , @entity62 and beyond			1
but what ’s this just below me ? it ca n’t be a naked buttock rising from a free - standing bath tub on the 47th floor ? it certainly is			1
the corners of the building have a square chunk taken out so neighbouring windows face each other at right - angles			1
look diagonally across and you can see straight in			2
you can also see the floor below , hence my close encounter with the buttock in question			2
i dare say people in the room next to mine across the gap , with their identical floor to ceiling windows , may have had the unsettling experience of seeing me wandering around in my birthday suit , too			1
guests at the hotel may enjoy a soak in the bath while watching over the bustling city below			1
@entity0 even spotted one visitor enjoying a soak a few floors below during his stay @entity100 keeping staff member @entity99 makes the enormous bed of a superior @entity0 room the modern and contemporary seating ares on the 34th level of the hotel - where rooms start at £ 450 a night a member of staff places bottles of champagne in an ice bucket inside the restaurant and lounge area on level 35 of @entity115 there is a solution , but it defeats the whole purpose of spending anything from £ 500 a night for a berth in @entity115 , which has 72 ‘ habitable ’ floors			1
press a button and the electrically operated blinds come down — obliterating the much - vaunted ‘ iconic ’ views that you ’ve spent a fortune to see			1
you might as well be in the local @entity133 , albeit one with heated lavatory seats , marble flooring , @entity129 di @entity128 soaps and a minibar selling mixed nuts for £ 7 a jar			0
all in all this dramatic design issue is highly embarrassing — unless you ’re a @entity138 or in the @entity140 society , which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year			0
and it ’s hardly something that the @entity15 can dismiss as teething troubles			1
‘ we are familiar with some flaws and will deal with those as we go along , ’ says the hotel ’s genial general manager , @entity145			1
for now , he says , it ’s a case of ‘ orientating guests properly ’ so they are aware of being spotted from below , above or to the side of their rooms			0
@entity157 , a businessman from @entity158 , who has booked in for a five - star stay with his wife @entity160 to celebrate her 60th birthday , thinks it is ‘ plain daft ’ and likens the whole experience to the opening of @entity165 at @entity166 when everything was built but not everything worked			1
my towel rail has a notice above it saying ‘ very hot ’ but is stone cold ; at breakfast my orange juice arrives after the coffee , and the toast turns up as i am about to leave			0
the hotel directory urges me to ‘ enjoy a signature cocktail ’ in @entity181 — the bar on the 52nd floor — there ’s no earthly chance of doing so because it is still under construction			2
a waiter lays a table in the restaurant on the 35th floor of the the hotel which boasts stunning views across the city the hotel 's @entity195 patisserie and artisan deli which offers guests a selection of delicious food and drink during their stay @entity204 chef de-parte @entity205 produces hand - made sweet pastries for the hotel 's @entity195 patisserie and artisan deli located at ground level kitchen staff preparing sandwiches for afternoon tea served in the hotel 's restaurant but if a deli experience is not up to standards , guests may enjoy a luxurious meal at the hotel 's restaurant , pictured but let ’s not get too steamed up			1
this is a triumph in so many wondrous ways and it ’s no surprise the reservations desk is busy			2
@entity227 and @entity228 , from @entity229 , booked as soon as the hotline opened two months ago			0
they went for a special ‘ romance in the @entity233 ’ package , which includes a three - course dinner , bed and breakfast , a bottle of champagne and two massages			2
the cost ? £ 850			0
‘ it ’s been well worth it , ’ says @entity227 , a 49 - year old farmer and builder			2
‘ life ’s too short			0
we ’re going to come again when the pool is ready			0
’ the 11m x 4m pool is due to open in july			0
the @entity181 bar will be next to the pool on the same floor and is likely to become one of the most exclusive bars in the world			0
eventually , there ’ll be 202 rooms ( 59 are ready so far ) and suites			0
mine is on the @entity260 side , looking down on the @entity261 on the other side of the river			0
in my room is a leather - bound copy of @entity268 ’s 1933 novel , @entity269			1
it ’s the story of a community in the mountains of @entity273 , best remembered as the origin of @entity15 , a fictional utopia			1
staff stand on scaffolding to clean just some of the thousands of metres of windows in the hotel a outside view of the hotel - whch opened earlier this week			1
the penthouse suite - which costs £ 16,000 - a - nigh - is still being worked on the @entity285 package at the @entity15 hotel starts from £ 530 per night based on two adults sharing plus b&b i dare say the @entity0 ’s celebrated architect , @entity290 , read it before embarking on the £ 90 million project			1
it ca n’t have been his idea to put the baths by the windows in full view of other guests			0
though it does add a certain frisson , an element of danger			0
‘ it ’s a house of mirrors , ’ says fellow guest @entity303 , 56 , who lives in @entity304			0
he ’s here celebrating his birthday with his wife and is already planning to return in december			0
‘ i ’ve stayed in tall buildings all over the world but this is the best of the lot — even better than the @entity314 in @entity315			0
it has surpassed my expectations			0
i love the silence in our room , then you open the blinds and all of life is out there but you still do n’t hear a word			2
’ but he has a word of caution			0
‘ you just have to remember to turn the lights off at night to avoid being spied on			0
’ room rates at the @entity15 ( 0207 234 8088 , shangri - la.com / london ) start at £ 450 per night			1
the ‘ @entity285 ’ package is from £ 530 per night , based on two adults sharing , @entity288 and two tickets to @entity331 from @entity115 .			0

@entity15 is located over 18 floors of landmark the shard and boasts the highest hotel room in @entity12
@entity339 is the first person to sleep at luxurious hotel - and says it is sensational in more ways than one
