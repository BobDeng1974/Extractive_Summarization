by @entity1 reporter published : 20:01 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 17 january 2013 @entity4 's weekly @entity3 programme has been ruled to have breached the corporation 's guidelines it is the gentle sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones			1
but fans of @entity4 ’s weekly @entity3 programme were surprised to discover their romantic messages were not getting through … because it was pre-recorded			2
sunday @entity15 has been ruled to have breached the corporation ’s guidelines by failing to explain music requests made during the show would not be broadcast the same day			1
the audience was told to phone in ‘ any time ’ with romantic song choices and messages , without an explanation the show ’s script was finalised three days earlier			2
it meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point			0
they also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show , broadcast between 9am and 11am every sunday			2
the @entity40 ’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience			1
it upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer @entity52 had been recorded before his death			0
the show is recorded on fridays , but the playlist and script are decided each thursday , meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show			0
an answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request			0
the @entity3 amended the on - air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call			0
the @entity40 has upheld a listener complaint ruling the show breached @entity74 guidelines but the committee ruled the updated message still breached accuracy guidelines because it was not made clear requests would have to be made before the thursday deadline to be included in the sunday show			1
the committee found the fact the show was presented ‘ as live ’ despite being pre-recorded was not a breach of editorial guidelines			1
it added the @entity3 did not intentionally mislead its audience , saying : ‘ the problem was essentially one of clarity			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ in light of the @entity40 ’s findings on clarity for people leaving dedications for the programme , we have revised the wording in order to ensure the process is absolutely clear for listeners			1
’ @entity4 is best known for presenting @entity104 ’s @entity4 in the afternoon the veteran dj , 58 , moved to @entity106 in 1996 .			0
