it was nice work while it lasted			0
a software developer making six - figures was fired after his bosses learned he outsourced his work to @entity9 so he could spend all day goofing off on the web , it was revealed today			1
the lazy but inventive worker , called ' @entity12 ' and identified as being a mid- 40s family man in a security report by @entity15 , was even praised by his superiors for being ' the best developer in the building			0
' beating the grind : a @entity21 - based software developer making six - figures was able to outsource all his work to @entity9			1
instead of slaving away at his computer , the man watched cat videos and surfed social media ' his code was clean , well written , and submitted in a timely fashion , the case study said			2
' quarter after quarter , his performance review noted him as the best developer in the building			0
' the man typically began his ' work ' day at a ' critical infrastructure ' company with a two - and - a - half - hour marathon session of surfing @entity39 and watching cat videos			1
here 's how the software developer spent a typical workday : after that strenuous work , the man , whose name or where he worked was not released , would take a 90 - minute lunch break			1
then the man , who was described as ' inoffensive and quiet			0
someone you would n’t look at twice in an elevator ' , would then spend about browsing deals on @entity52			2
after that , the long - tenured employee would check social media by posting @entity57 updates and checking people 's profiles on @entity60			1
once the end of the day came , he sent out an e-mail to management updating them , presumably on the work that others had done in @entity9 at his behest			2
the report said he was somehow able to pull this scam off at multiple companies , earning several hundred thousands of dollars a year while paying out approximately $ 50,000 to the @entity9 consulting firm			1
beats working : the lazy worker was able to watch hours of cat videos a day , much like this one of two cats leaping around as they swat at a toy his ruse was uncovered last year when the developer 's @entity21 - based company noticed that network activity was originating in @entity83 , @entity9			1
fearing a security breach , they contacted @entity15 to get to the bottom of it			0
the @entity15 investigators noticed the suspicious activity was occurring regularly and often spanned the entire eight - hour workday			0
mystery solved : @entity15 investigators were the ones who discovered the software developer 's tricks they then spoke with the employee , whose credentials were being used to sustain the network connection in @entity9 , and searched his company			0
they found invoices for the @entity9 firm and searched his web history which confirmed ' the whole story , ' the report concluded .			0
