by @entity1 reporter published : 04:58 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 20 april 2012 a father who visited his local bookies to put a bet on the @entity5 found his luck was in - after the bookie diagnosed his baby 's life - threatening condition			1
@entity10 popped into his local @entity11 to place a bet on the popular horse racing event , with little @entity14 , who was unwell			1
he got chatting to the cashier @entity15 , who immediately recognised the symptoms , and wrote the condition down for him on a betting slip			1
@entity10 and @entity20 , with son @entity21 and daughter @entity14 : a bookie diagnosed @entity14 's stomach condition after @entity26 staff failed to doctors at the @entity28 , @entity29 , had twice told @entity14 's parents that her vomiting and incessant crying was caused by a common problem called gastric reflux , which can usually be eased by more frequent feeds and extra burping			1
but @entity14 , now nine weeks old , was in fact suffering from pyloric stenosis - a rare the narrowing of the opening from the stomach into the small intestine - that could have left her fatally dehydrated			1
@entity15 recognised the disease because her own daughter , now 11 , had suffered with it as a baby			1
the condition causes severe projectile vomiting and typically occurs in babies aged two to six weeks			2
all better : an operation has fixed @entity14 's rare condition mr @entity10 did some quick research on the internet then took @entity14 straight to @entity54 , where she was correctly diagnosed with the condition			1
@entity56 quickly underwent a 40 - minute operation on monday morning which fixed the problem			0
mr @entity10 said : ' it 's like bringing a different baby home , she 's so much more settled			1
we 're just glad she 's back and well			0
she 's only been home a couple of days but she 's much happier			0
' the sales manager , who lives with his wife @entity69 , 32 , and son @entity21 , 8 , from @entity71 has now started legal action against the @entity28			0
doctors at the hospital diagnosed gastric reflux when @entity56 was aged two weeks and seven weeks			1
mr @entity10 said : ' she was in pain constantly , crying all the time			0
we have been stuffing her with medication that she has not needed for nine weeks			0
' i just feel that we were pacified for being over-protective parents when our baby was on the verge of death			2
' i want to make other parents aware of this			0
i am just so relieved , we went through a journey from hell			0
' when ms @entity15 , 35 , heard @entity56 ’s symptoms she said she knew exactly what was wrong with her			2
' it was bizarre , he was explaining what was going on with his baby and it was like he was saying what had happened to me , ' she said			2
' i had the exact same problems with my daughter when she was two weeks old , it was just hell			0
' luck was in : mr @entity10 put an each way bet on @entity105 ( pictured right ) who came in second behind @entity107 ( left ) @entity109 stenosis affects about one in every 350 babies , usually boys			2
it prevents the baby digesting milk and causes them to vomit , which can lead to severe dehydration and in some cases , death			2
royal @entity28 bosses defended the diagnosis , saying babies with pyloric stenosis usually lose weight as well as the other symptoms			1
in pyloric stenosis , the muscles in the lower part of the stomach enlarge , narrowing the opening of the pylorus and eventually preventing food from moving from the stomach to the intestine head of communications @entity136 said : ' if a baby is only displaying vomiting without being dehydrated and losing weight this is more likely to be a different diagnosis such as gastric reflux			1
' we ’re very sorry if mr @entity10 feels that staff did not explain this to him fully and also that he did not feel they were taking his concerns seriously			0
' meanwhile we ’re pleased to hear that little @entity14 is well and hope she continues to make good progress			1
' and mr @entity10 's flutter paid off as well			0
he put a fiver each way on @entity105 , who came in a very close second .			0
