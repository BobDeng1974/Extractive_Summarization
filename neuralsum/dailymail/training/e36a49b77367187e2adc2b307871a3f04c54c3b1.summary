by @entity0 published : 10:08 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 15:42 est , 6 december 2012 @entity2 ’s biggest collection of light bulbs went under the hammer for £ 1,750 at auction today			1
the set of more than 500 bulbs was bought as a single lot by a @entity10 buyer after the electrician who spent years collecting them died			1
it was described by auctioneer @entity14 as ' probably the finest collection of light bulbs that has ever gone up for auction			1
' they date back to 1890 and were amassed by @entity19 - a lighting and engineering specialist who travelled the world for his work			1
@entity19 's 500 lightbulbs are expected to fetch more than £ 3,000 when they are auctioned the late electrician collected the bulbs over an illustrious career which saw him light @entity29 @entity19 spent 30 years with @entity30 and was responsible for the interior lighting and floodlighting at @entity33 , @entity29 and @entity34			1
in 1988 even appeared on the scientific tv quiz show brainstorm hosted by @entity36 to explain the development of lighting through the decades			2
he collected light bulbs during his career which featured in exhibitions at the @entity42 and the @entity43			2
the collection had originally been donated to the science museum but is believed to have been put up for auction because the bulbs would have been too awkward to display and maintain			1
@entity48 : despite most of the light bulbs coming from @entity2 , these orange and blue bulbs hail from @entity52			2
they also have a decorative patterned glass and , as is typical of many bulbs which we use today , they have a standard bayonet connection classic : these double - filament bulbs show the intricate , fragile filaments inside which provide the bulb 's light			1
the bulbs are classically designed and are likely to have come from @entity2 most of the light bulbs are @entity2 , although the coloured bulbs with decorative glass come from @entity52			0
it is unknown exactly how mr @entity71 came by the bulbs , although he is said to have been part of a collectors circle who traded the rare objects			1
mr @entity14 said the rarest bulb up for auction dated from 1900 and had four special ' tier ' filaments made from platinum and an unusual metal called tantalum			1
this enabled it to glow for much longer than its predecessors and makes it ' extraordinarily rare ' today			1
inventive : @entity89 @entity14 described the large collection of light bulbs as ' rare and unusual '			1
the double filaments inside these two bulbs are extremely elaborate compared to a standard bulb			0
the filaments on the bulb on the left extend virtually the length of the bulb			0
the bulb on the right has a unique chocolate colour bold : the auctioneer said the collection gives a ' fascinating glimpse ' of early lighting technology			2
this @entity52 bulb on the left is likely to give off a dim glow and was made for decorative purposes			0
unlike many of these bulbs , the one on the right has a screw fitting and resembles a snow globe with its decorative flecks he said : ' i think it probably is the finest collection of antique light bulbs that has ever gone up for auction ' it 's a worldwide collection but the bulbs are mostly @entity2			1
we had some bulbs on sale which look as if they have four tiers of support - these are very sought after			0
' they have got platinum and another metal called tantalum - they were the next stage on from a carbon filament			0
' that gave a long - life bulb , but they are extraordinarily rare - they date from about 1900			0
' the coloured bulbs are @entity52 and were made for decorative purposes			2
mr @entity14 added : ' @entity19 was just steeped in this world - light bulbs were just his working life and private life it seems			1
' he bequeathed them to the science museum , but they did n't want it because it was too much hassle			0
most of them use a standard bayonet connection that we have today			0
' collectors who buy the bulbs want their filaments to work			0
they are n't interested in a bulb whose filament does n't			0
' they pass a low voltage through it , and you get a very dull glow			0
' asked how the buyer would be able to collect their fragile purchase intact , mr @entity14 said : ' the buyer is going to come and get them himself			0
' i think they 're going to be packed carefully in a lot of smaller boxes			0
' @entity89 @entity14 inspects some of the 500 lightbulbs set to go under the hammer this week the fragile bulbs have been carefully packed in bubble wrap to avoid breakages prior to the sale			2

collection of 500 bulbs belonged to lighting engineer @entity19
