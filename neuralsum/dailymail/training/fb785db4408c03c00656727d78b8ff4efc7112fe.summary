the young red fox had got itself in a bit of a jam			2
there was only one thing for it - the notoriously shy creature was going to have to ask humans for help			2
it clearly could n't resist having a look at a discarded glass jar and ended up with its head stuck inside			0
in this short but sweet footage , the fox is spotted by two men on a @entity17 dirt road			1
one of the men reached down to grab the jar , which made the creature wriggle to try to escape			0
but the fox quickly realised that tactic would n't work and stood still for its rescuer			1
the man , who appeared to be wearing camouflage army gear , grabbed the fox by the scruff of its neck and pulled the jar away with his other hand			2
at first the young fox wriggled as one of the men tried to pull the jar away the fox quickly realised it needed to stand still while the man took it by the scruff of its neck and gently tugged the jar away in a flash , the fox made the most of its freedom and ran away			0
the man joked in @entity17 : ' where is the thank you ? ' according to 9 @entity58			1
he then said : ' thank you ' in a higher - pitched voice , pretending to be their bushy - tailed friend			0
the other man pointed out : ' he would have died that way			0
' the fox made a quick dash to freedom while one of the men joked in @entity17 : ' where 's the thank you ? '			1

*filmed* on a @entity17 dirt road , this shows the wild fox *overcome* its shyness
*curiosity* had got the better of the fox and it knew humans were its only help
one rescuer joked : ' where 's the thank you ? ' as it *returned* to the bushes
