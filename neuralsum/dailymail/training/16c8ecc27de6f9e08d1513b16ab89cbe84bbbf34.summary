by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 2 august 2012 it is one of the most daring space missions ever attempted			2
early on monday morning the @entity5 will , if all goes according to plan , enter the martian atmosphere and begin a series of hugely complex manoeuvres to bring it gently onto the surface			1
they include a radical floating ' sky crane ' as part of a descent dubbed the ' seven minutes of terror '			2
@entity28 has even done a deal to show it in @entity30 , while space fans elsewhere are planning parties			1
' in the city that never sleeps , the historic @entity30 will be the place for @entity37 to participate in this historic landing , ' @entity33 , @entity28 's associate administrator for science missions , said			1
when you think of all the big news events in history , you think of @entity30 , and i can think of no better venue to celebrate this news - making event on @entity46			1
' the landing will be shown on the big screen in @entity30 the curiosity rover has taken the public 's imagination by storm , in one of the most daring space missions ever attempted			1
the rover , @entity5 , is designed to search for clues about possible past life in a crater that might once have been filled with water			1
the £ 1.59 billion six - wheeled machine is twice as long and five times as heavy as the twin rovers @entity61 which landed on @entity46 in 2004			0
two @entity64 scientists are members of the team which will direct the rover and analyse the data it collects			1
the @entity30 broadcast begins at 11:30 p.m. edt sunday night and runs until 4 a.m. edt monday morning ( aug. 6 )			1
the exact time of landing is scheduled for 1:31 a.m. aug. 6 edt ( 0531 gmt ) , though it will be late monday night at the rover 's @entity73 - based mission control room			1
@entity28 has a full list of @entity77 events to watch the landing here			1
dr @entity78 , from the @entity79 , one of the @entity64 scientists working on the @entity82 , said : ' i ’m cautiously optimistic			1
' space exploration is not for the faint hearted			0
' the previous rover landing used inflatable bouncing bags			2
curiosity ’s just too heavy for that , so they developed the sky crane technique			0
' @entity5 ’s target is @entity92 , near the @entity46 equator , where there are geological signs of past water			2
the plan is to land close to @entity98 , a 5.5 - kilometre peak in the centre of the crater with clay deposits around its base			2
if all goes well the radio signal confirming that @entity5 has landed will arrive on @entity105 after a 14 - minute journey through space at 06.31 , @entity64 time			0
for one @entity46 year - 98 @entity105 weeks - @entity5 will explore its surroundings using its robot arm and a formidable array of scientific instruments to analyse samples drilled from rocks or scooped from the ground			0
it also carries a laser capable of zapping rocks up to 30 feet away , vaporising tiny amounts of material in a flash of light that can be analysed to reveal chemical data			0
as well carrying a stereo camera to take panoramic shots , @entity5 will be equipped with a magnifying imager that can reveal details smaller than the width of a human hair			0
geologist professor @entity128 , from @entity129 , the other @entity64 scientist involved in the mission , said : ' @entity28 chose @entity92 as the landing site because it has a number of really exciting geological features that we are hoping to explore			1
@entity136 : the known as @entity92 crater area where @entity28 's @entity5 will land on august 5 ' these include a canyon and what appears to be a lake bed on the floor of the crater , as well as a channel and a delta , which we think may have been carved by water			1
after entering the @entity46 atmosphere at 13,200mph , the capsule containing @entity5 will be slowed by friction and then a supersonic parachute			0
an ' upper stage ' resembling a flying bedstead will then be deployed , firing retro rockets to brake its descent			0
as it hovers over the landing site , the upper stage will transform itself into a ' sky crane ' and lower curiosity to the surface on the end of a tether			2
it will then break away , and deliberately crash			0
' we will use the rover ’s cameras , including one which is like a powerful magnifying glass , to study the geology up close			2
' dr @entity78 and @entity173 will be based at @entity28 ’s @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity73 , during the mission			1
they will be among hundreds of scientists who will work together round the clock analysing data beamed back from @entity5 , planning experiments and guiding the rover ’s excursions			1
dr @entity78 said a key goal is to study the clay sediments at the foot of @entity98			0
scientists believe they are a reminder of a time , three to four billion years ago , when there was abundant water on the surface of @entity46			2
' the clay layers may represent what we loosely call a warm and wet period in @entity46 history , ' said dr @entity78			0
' on the top of the mountain the rock was deposited under dry conditions , so there was a great environmental change			0
' there ’s this idea that @entity46 was warm and wet long ago , but we do n’t know how long there were standing bodies of water on @entity46 , whether they were short lived or lasted hundreds of millions of years			0
' that ’s important to the question of whether life ever existed there			2
although we ’ve made enormous strides in understanding @entity46 over the last 10 or 20 years , there ’s still a lot we do n’t know			0
' an @entity218 rocket carrying @entity5 blasted off from @entity219 , @entity220 , in november			0
the journey to @entity46 crossed 352 million miles of space			0
@entity28 's @entity5 , which is set to land on the red planet of surface - if it survives a descent known as ' seven minutes of terror ' video : just what is inside the @entity5 ? find out here ! ...			1

rover scheduled to land at @entity231 ( gmt ) on monday morning
scientists say they are ' cautiously optimistic '
@entity30 will show @entity28 *coverage* , while @entity236 will *webcast* it
@entity238 will search for signs of life on the red planet 's surface using a scoop to dig into the soil
