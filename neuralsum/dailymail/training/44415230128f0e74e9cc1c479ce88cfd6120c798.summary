parents need to be aware predators could use smartphone location apps to monitor and track the precise location of their children , the former head of @entity1 has warned			1
sir @entity7 has said there is no ' absolute protection ' of information children share online and once smartphone location apps have been given consent to track the phone , it is difficult to control who uses the information			1
ahead of a speech at the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) annual meeting in @entity21 , south @entity22 , sir @entity7 said that the world , and above all the technological environment , has rapidly changed			1
tracking information on apps such as @entity27 ( pictured ) could be used by predators the former spy chief warned that in general , there is ' no absolute protection ' against a determined online attack , adding it is vital to know what young people are learning online			1
the public can protect themselves by using passwords and other measures against 80 % of intrusions but ' everybody has to understand that you ca n't be absolutely certain that somebody , somewhere , wo n't get it '			0
information gathered through tracking apps is meant to be secure - however , recent scandals such as the celebrity nude photos hacks have shown such data can be easily accessed for other , more sinister purposes			1
sir @entity7 , who served as chief of the @entity52 for five years until 2009 , said : ' you 've got to know what your children are doing , it 's very difficult to know exactly what they 're doing in particular when they 're on a tablet or something they 've got and you 've got to have some kind of idea			1
sir @entity7 ( pictured ) has warned predators may be able to use location apps to track children ' they are extremely vulnerable , everybody is , to a whole range of things			1
clearly when they 're young children they 're particularly vulnerable to predators			1
' he said this also included sexual predators			2
' personally what worries me , in a way , most , is tracking devices			0
' the way in which locational apps for example are now quite freely available , of course you can start off by consciously giving out that information , but once you 've done that , you 've lost control of it			2
' there is a need for everyone to be aware that once information is shared online , for example through using a search engine , it can be used by different firms , ' he added that youngsters can also be tracked through getting into conversations online , or by using apps that use an individual 's location			1
' it 's the tracking , and obviously if you get into conversations , i do n't really see how that can be controlled unless you have some idea what your child 's doing			0
' his ' basic advice ' was to teach children common sense values to stick to , such as being aware of the information they give out and how they express themselves			2
young girls were obviously vulnerable to tracking and there were individuals able to track someone ' right down to more or less precisely where you are '			2
he also suggested that the public should be more worried about threats from terrorists and international criminal networks than the government snooping on them			0
@entity131 has requested comment from @entity133			0
the way in which an online predator could go about tracking a child 's smartphone is astonishingly simple			2
only days ago the @entity138 indicted a man for selling a spyware application which could monitor smartphones ' calls , texts , videos and phone calls			0
not only could it monitor that information , but it could pick up the phone 's gps as well as operate its microphone turning it into a bug to listen into conversations up to 15 feet away from the handset			0
for example , find my iphone is an security - enabled app which enables a gps inside the phone to give off a signal			0
theoretically , in the event of the theft of the phone , you can then use your secure log - on to find its exact location on a web browser			0
however , spyware programmes - for which the predator needs only a few minutes on their victim 's phone to install - enables the data from that phone to be synchronised with its customer 's account on the internet			0
this information includes the gps signal given off by the phone - which when monitored online ( either by its intended user , or a predator using spyware ) gives off a green dot signalling its exact location			1
if you suspect your phone has been infected with spyware , it 's recommended you perform a factory reset which will delete all data and apps installed after the handset was purchased .			0

predators can use location apps to track your children , warns sir @entity7
former head of @entity1 : there is no ' absolute protection ' of online information
once tracking is consented to , there is no way of controlling who uses it
predators are able to use tracking to locate people to a ' precise location '
