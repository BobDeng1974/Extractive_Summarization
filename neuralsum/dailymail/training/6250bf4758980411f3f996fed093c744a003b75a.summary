it says a lot about the reputation of @entity4 chairman @entity3 among supporters that @entity6 is no longer regarded as the most tasteless comedian in the entertainment capital of the north			1
somehow one of @entity13 football ’s great traditional clubs has turned into a laughing stock under @entity3 ’s stewardship			2
it has left thousands of fans desperately worried about the future of their famous old club who supplied two of @entity25 ’s @entity24 - winning squad , @entity26 and @entity27			1
laughing stock : @entity4 have turned into something of a mess under chairman @entity3 brave face : manager @entity33 has been in dispute with @entity35 over the club 's transfer policy on friday , beleaguered manager @entity33 worked with just eight senior professionals at the club ’s dilapidated training ground near @entity42			1
the numbers were swelled by trialists begging for contracts , and youth team players			1
those who chose to shower afterwards found only two temperatures available , freezing cold or scorching hot			2
with trial goalkeeper @entity51 suddenly jumping ship , last season ’s youth - team goalie @entity49 was needed between the sticks so the few outfield players present had at least the semblance of an ordinary training session			1
with just a fortnight to go before the kick off of the @entity60 season , @entity4 have played just one pre-season friendly , a meaningless kickabout against non-league @entity63 in which @entity64 deliberately left out some of his contracted players			1
they were originally meant to be at a training camp in @entity69 yesterday but that was cancelled a long time ago due to lack of numbers			1
despite a total breakdown between @entity77 and @entity64 , the @entity73 coach and four members of his backroom staff have not walked and turned up to work every day , cheerful and enthusiastic			2
@entity3 ca n’t or wo n’t sack @entity64 without first finding someone else prepared to work with him			0
the stand - off has left @entity4 odds - on favourites for relegation and even though the club have offered two - year season ticket sales for the price of one year , numbers are well down on the 11,000 last season			1
ruin : a skip at @entity4 's training ground rundown : the outside of @entity4 's @entity92 and @entity93 falling apart : a scene from the club 's training ground fans primarily blame chairman @entity3 , whose father @entity99 – the club ’s owner - was paid £ 11million when @entity4 were relegated from the @entity101 in 2010/11			1
they are convinced that when the final parachute payment of about £ 9million is paid in early august , it will somehow end up in the pockets of the @entity3 family rather than invested in new players			2
the few that have sympathy for @entity35 are suspicious that @entity64 ’s transfer targets are unrealistic and will see money paid to agents			0
his only ‘ buy ’ so far , @entity114 international @entity113 , is a lightweight winger who can not be guaranteed to be successful in the championship			0
stuck in the middle of the dispute between chairman and manager are the fans			2
an inaugural meeting of the @entity123 ’ club at a working man ’s club near @entity126 a fortnight ago attracted 500 people			2
chairman @entity128 said : ‘ our job is to hold the owners to account			0
we would either ask the @entity132 to put the football first or let someone else take over			0
i think it is fair to say we are not happy with them			0
’ @entity128 has n’t bought a season - ticket for the first time in 25 years			0
he will go to home games on a match - by - match basis and attend all the away games			0
‘ the only people at @entity4 who have benefited since we were in the @entity101 are @entity3 and his family , ’ he says			1
‘ he promoted his new manager as the @entity64 revolution when he appointed him a few week ago and almost from day one we are in a situation where he is n’t backing him			0
the @entity150 stand - off has been going for seven weeks – it is beyond bizarre			0
’ short on numbers : @entity4 have had to field a large number of trialists in recent friendlies youngsters : they have just eight first - team players currently on their books meanwhile , the triallists continue to turn up and pray they will get a contract			1
they include midfielders @entity161 and @entity163 who both played for relegated @entity164 last season			0
in an ultimate insult , former @entity4 favourite @entity166 is set to turn down an offer from the club to join @entity170 neighbours @entity171 instead			1
at the stadium , they are working on the pretence of business as usual			0
@entity35 has built all the trimmings onto the stadium ; a hotel , spa , conference rooms that can be hired for meetings and functions , all against a tangerine backdrop			0
but the @entity4 fans now refer to their home ground as @entity186 , rather than @entity126			1
they would be happy to allow @entity188 @entity187 take over			0
he owns 20 per cent of the club but has failed to persuade the @entity132 to give him any more .			2

desperate fans worried about the future of their club after a period of unrest
just eight senior players are currently on @entity4 's books
supporters concerned about the lack of investment in playing staff
they were a @entity101 club as recently as 2011
