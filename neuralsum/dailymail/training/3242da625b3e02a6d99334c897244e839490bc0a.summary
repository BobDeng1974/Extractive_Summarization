@entity0 is embraced by his wife @entity1 after his victory speech a deeply divided @entity3 faced up to another four years of political acrimony yesterday despite @entity0 ’s victory promise that ‘ the best is yet to come ’			1
after his triumph over @entity7 , mr @entity0 joined his rival in calling for an end to the bitter partisan divide that has engulfed not only @entity11 but the wider country			1
for all the brave talk after this ‘ status quo election ’ , mr @entity0 returns to @entity11 to find the same divided @entity15 , with defiant @entity16 still in control of the @entity18			1
and despite a convincing victory in the @entity20 – in which he has so far won at least 303 votes to mr @entity7 ’s 206 – the president will have trouble claiming a sweeping mandate after he secured only a 2 per cent lead in the popular vote			2
last night the stock markets reflected these fears as @entity29 slumped , with some £ 60billion wiped off share prices			1
and hours after a triumphant mr @entity0 told an ecstatic crowd in @entity32 he was ‘ more determined and inspired than ever ’ , senior @entity16 were already warning that they will keep fighting for lower taxes and deep spending cuts to spur economic growth and cut @entity3 ’s debt			1
‘ the voters have not endorsed the failures or excesses of the president ’s first term , ’ said @entity38 leader @entity38 icily			0
the @entity3 could be plunged back into recession as soon as january if politicians fail to come together to address the ‘ fiscal cliff ’ of scheduled huge spending cuts and tax increases of almost £ 1trillion			2
unlike four years ago when mr @entity0 became the first black president , this election is historic for a rather less inspiring reason			1
no @entity53 incumbent since @entity54 during the @entity55 has won re-election with unemployment – at 7.9 percent – so high			0
senator @entity38 , left , said that voters have ' not endorsed the failures ' of @entity0 's first term in office , with the president the first to be re-elected with unemployment so high since @entity54 , right , during the @entity55 much of mr @entity0 ’s success is being laid on the failure of mr @entity7 to capitalise on 12.3million jobless americans			1
in the event , after a 17 - month campaign that was the most expensive in @entity3 history at £ 3billion , very little has changed			2
the political map of the @entity3 remains almost exactly how it was in 2008 , as mr @entity7 failed to oust the @entity71 in the crucial swing states which the president dramatically won in 2008			1
mr @entity7 , whose political career is effectively over after two @entity53 bids , urged @entity3 unity in a gracious concession speech in the early hours of wednesday			1
he told a hushed 2,000 - strong crowd that @entity3 had to put ‘ people before politics ’ , adding : ‘ at a time like this we ca n’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing			2
’ defeated @entity16 presidential candidate graciously called for unity in @entity3 in his concession speech half an hour later , as @entity71 celebrated with relief rather than the breathless jubilation of 2008 , mr @entity0 gave his own speech			1
rediscovering some of the soaring rhetoric missing during much of his campaign , mr @entity0 insisted the battle against mr @entity7 had made him a better president			1
joined on stage by wife @entity1 and their children , he echoed mr @entity7 ’s call to find consensus with opponents – a pledge he also made in 2008 with little success – but admitted fierce political disagreement would continue			0
such arguments were ‘ a mark of our liberty ’ denied to millions , he said , adding : ‘ despite all the frustrations of @entity11 i have never been more hopeful about our future			0
’ preliminary figures suggest a drop in voter turnout			0
more than 118million are known to have cast their vote and that will rise as counting continues – but it is predicted the total will fall far short of the 131million in 2008 , according to the @entity119			0
results : state by state pedestrians walk in the rain past the @entity125 the day after president @entity0 was re-elected @entity29 went into freefall last night as investors woke up to the reality that @entity0 ’s victory had done nothing to resolve @entity3 ’s huge budget problems			1
the @entity132 plunged nearly 300 points – or £ 60billion – its biggest decline in 2012 and the largest setback since november 2011 when @entity3 financiers feared that the @entity3 recovery could be snuffed out by the crisis in the eurozone			1
the adverse reaction of @entity29 to the outcome of the elections , that leave the president and the @entity16 - controlled @entity18 at loggerheads over @entity3 ’s huge deficit and debt , spread across the @entity147 wiping 93.27 points , or 1.58 per cent , off the @entity150 share index in @entity151			2
tension on the markets increased after investment bankers @entity154 lowered its forecast for @entity3 growth next year from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent			0
the credit ratings agency @entity158 warned that unless the president speedily secures an agreement to overcome the ‘ fiscal cliff ’ – that would automatically take $ 600billion out of the economy through budget cuts and tax increases – it would lower its credit rating from its top ‘ @entity167 ’ status			0
‘ it ’s not as simple as @entity7 lost so the stock market falls , ’ said the @entity29 firm @entity168			2
‘ right now it is back to business in @entity3 and that ’s tied up to the fiscal cliff and taxes			0
’ in contrast , however , the dollar strengthened against the pound and the euro in reaction to a sharp fall in @entity184 industrial production and reports of a slowdown in @entity187			0
there has been a realisation on @entity29 that the election has not changed @entity3 ’s budgetary crisis at all and despite all the talk of bipartisanship , @entity15 and the @entity53 are as bitterly divided as ever			2
if a compromise can not be reached , existing legislation would require the @entity53 to slash spending and increase taxes by almost £ 400billion in a punishing move that could wipe out up to 3 per cent of growth and push the @entity3 and much of the world – including @entity201 – back into recession			0
treasury secretary , @entity203 , has already signalled his post-election departure mr @entity0 ’s task is not made any easier by uncertainty over the future shape of his economic team			1
the current treasury secretary , @entity203 , has already signalled his post-election departure			0
in choosing his replacement , many believe he should appoint a high - profile figure from the financial community			0
the name of @entity215 , a @entity216 - era deputy treasury secretary and co-founder of the investment firm @entity218 has been mentioned			0
so has that of @entity220 , who runs the world ’s biggest investor @entity221			0
if mr @entity0 goes for a @entity11 insider , then it is thought that @entity225 , the current @entity53 chief of staff , would be in the frame			1
president @entity216 ’s former head of staff @entity228 , with a record of dealing with @entity230 , is also seen as a favoured candidate .			0

both mr @entity0 and rival @entity7 called for an end to the bitter partisan divide that has engulfed @entity3
@entity29 reflected fears of a divide as the economy slumped with some £ 60billion wiped off shares
