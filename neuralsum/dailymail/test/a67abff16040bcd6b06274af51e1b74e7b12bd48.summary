a husband was left so traumatised by his wife 's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock , despite his wife already being given a hefty payout			1
in a case which could have huge financial consequences for the @entity10 , @entity7 was awarded £ 160,000 after she was left ' looking like @entity12 man ' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008			1
her husband @entity14 , who lives with mrs @entity7 in @entity15 , @entity16 , was awarded £ 9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife 's appearance			1
@entity19 was given £ 9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up ' like @entity12 man ' after botched surgery at @entity24 ( pictured ) the severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis , which the woman had contracted during the surgery at @entity24			1
the @entity10 is now fighting to overturn the payout , fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation			1
the test case , being heard at @entity35 's @entity34 , could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an @entity10 mishap			1
mr @entity19 was awarded the damages from @entity24 in july 2013			1
@entity16 @entity42 heard how he had been a ' secondary victim ' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife 's new appearance			1
he had described her ' colloquially as looking like a @entity12 man ' , the court heard			2
mr @entity19 also described his wife 's first two days in hospital as ' the worst days of my entire life '			2
he said he had been ' brought up not to complain ' but had never fully recovered from the sight			2
he added that he had been left feeling tearful , overwhelmed , angry and powerless			2
the judge , who described him as ' an honest and reliable witness ' , said : ' his symptoms ... were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife			2
' but in the appeal court today , @entity65 , who represents the health trust , told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury			1
he said mr @entity19 's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims , costing the cash - strapped @entity10 millions in compensation			1
the barrister argued that mr @entity19 would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation			1
he added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell			2
he told the court : ' hospitals on a day - to - day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable			0
they go there followed by their loved ones			0
it is unfortunately a matter of day - to - day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital			0
the @entity10 is now fighting to overturn the payout , fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if mr @entity19 is allowed to keep the money			1
the test case is being heard at the appeal court ' the question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim			0
' stressing the importance of the appeal , he told the judges : ' this appeal is not just about this case , but the concerns nhs trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place			1
@entity117 is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum , the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach			0
it is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection , which can rapidly spread around the body			0
@entity117 requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency			0
most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body , such as a split stomach ulcer , a burst appendix or digestive disorders			2
@entity117 can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications			0
source : @entity10 ' the effect of this judgement , if it stands , is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases , as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock			1
' often emotional illness follows , but there is not the necessary element of shock			2
there needs to be a suddenly shocking event which , because of its shocking nature , causes that psychiatric illness			0
that is often lost in the wash in these cases			0
' but @entity165 said the incident had no doubt been ' shocking ' ' simply going into hospital and seeing one 's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough , ' he said			0
' but to see one 's wife looking like the @entity12 man is shocking			0
' mr @entity174 then replied : ' if you saw your loved one looking like the @entity12 man , swollen and all that , it would be shocking in an ordinary sense			0
' but it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury			0
' the judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust 's appeal until a later date			0
the case was heard in front of @entity165 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
mrs @entity7 went on to make a good recovery .			1

@entity7 was given £ 160,000 after a botched hysterectomy in 2008
she contracted peritonitis following surgery at @entity24
@entity14 was given £ 9,000 for ' shock ' and being ' secondary victim '
@entity10 fighting payout , fearing it could open the *floodgates* to similar claims
