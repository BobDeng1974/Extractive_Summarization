by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 17:48 est , 11 march 2014 it was once the hub of a filthy , bustling and intense trade in human cattle , which saw millions of men , women and children pass through its docks			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 was a slave market and centre for the industry in the early 1800s , when @entity14 was a far greater buyer of slaves than anywhere in @entity18			1
but the dark hub of the slave trade in @entity10 , which was unearthed by archaeologists in the scramble to redevelop the city ahead of the 2016 @entity24 , has once again become the centre of controversy			1
uncovered : a construction worker walks on the @entity28 , which was built on top of the notorious @entity9 uncovering : work has continued in the area ahead of the @entity32 , though for while architects and developers in the city hurry through their construction projects , scholars of @entity14 history - and the descendants of the country 's slave population - have begun a fight to properly acknowledge and memorialise the historic discovery , rather than covering it with buildings			1
the port area , once the home to ' fattening houses ' where exhausted and diseased slaves would be groomed and sent on to plantations , is being rapidly reshaped into a development which will be known as the @entity52 - which translate as ' marvellous port '			0
it will be many visitors ' first sight of @entity10 as they approach the city in 2016			2
but the area is currently occupied , and also prominent @entity14 historians have complained that efforts to commemorate the area 's past are far too little			1
a local campaign is applying pressure to have the area recognised as a world heritage site by @entity66			2
construction : the area is being cleared out so that skyscrapers and gated villas can be built works : locals and campaigners have said that the work is happening too quickly and more needs to be done to recognise the area 's history finds : archaeologists discovered the area in 2011 and uncovered hundreds of items related to the slave trade critics have said the efforts which are being made , such as the $ 100million @entity83 , dedicated to science and technology , are a step in the opposite direction , along with the skyscrapers and gated villas earmarked for construction			1
@entity91 , a legal academic who once sat on the city 's council , complained that the potential for properly recognising the space was being ignored in favour of speedy development			2
speaking to the @entity100 , she said : ' we ’re finding archaeological sites of global importance , and probably far more extensive than what ’s been excavated so far , but instead of prioritizing these discoveries our leaders are proceeding with their grotesque remaking of @entity10			0
' @entity108 , an architect , told the newspaper : ' archaeologists are exposing the foundations of our unequal society while we are witnessing a perverse attempt to remake the city into something resembling @entity116 or @entity117			0
found : this bronze token is a religious object which would have belonged to slaves or their descendants ' we ’re losing an opportunity to focus in detail on our past , and maybe even learn from it			0
' the @entity127 wharf was in operation from 1818 to 1830 , when it was later replaced with a more ornate version in honour of a @entity133 empress			0
the slave trade continued for decades after in @entity14 , and was only abolished in 1888 , more than 80 years after it was abolished in the @entity135			1
even while the trade was in full flow , visitors from @entity138 were horrified , with clergyman @entity141 writing at the time : ' they are handled by the purchaser in different parts , exactly as i have seen butchers feeling a calf , ' he said			0
' i sometimes saw groups of well - dressed females here , shopping for slaves , exactly as i have seen @entity138 ladies amusing themselves at our bazaars			0
' construction : locals and scholars are attempting to have the area recognised by @entity66 digs : the area is being prepared for a transformation into the ' @entity161 '			0

@entity9 in @entity14 was once the hub of the slave trade
@entity167 slave market saw hundreds of thousands bought and sold
was uncovered in 2011 by developers getting ready for 2016 @entity24
historical find needs to be properly recognised , say campaigners
but they have *attacked* @entity14 developers for pressing ahead
