by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 13:34 est , 19 march 2012 the highest - priority risks to @entity3 's national security are influenza pandemics , coastal flooding , terrorist attacks and - a new addition - volcanic eruptions in @entity8 , according to the recently published 2012 edition of the government 's @entity10			1
the list also said that ‘ severe space weather ’ poses a threat to communications systems , electronic circuits and power grids			1
solar storms - eruptions of magnetic energy and charged particles - are part of the sun 's normal 11 - year cycle , which is expected to reach a peak next year			1
@entity25 is on : solar storms on the @entity27 go through 11 - year cycles - and will peak next year the storms ca n't hurt people , but can disturb electric grids , gps systems and satellites			1
in 1989 , a strong solar storm knocked out the power grid in @entity36 , cutting electricity to 6 million people			1
last week , the strongest solar storm since 2004 passed without major disruptions			1
last month , @entity42 's defense committee called on the government to prepare for disruptions to electrical supplies and satellites from electromagnetic pulses - whether caused by the sun or by a nuclear weapon exploded in space			2
space war is not included on the @entity3 government 's risk register			2
‘ we are becoming more and more reliant on technology , and that technology is becoming more and more delicate , ’ the committee 's chairman , @entity56 mp @entity54 , told @entity57 yesterday			2
‘ be afraid , very afraid			2
’ disruption : radiation from the @entity27 flies out towards @entity62 at 93,000,000mph and can knock out power grids @entity64 , one of the @entity66 's representatives on the panel , meanwhile , told paper : ' potentially the biggest risk of all is to the electricity supply			1
now in the @entity72 that is deemed to be a catastrophic risk			0
they could lose a very large proportion of their power grid			1
' in the @entity3 , for many different reasons – better engineering design , different way it operates , geology – the risk is less severe , but it is a risk nonetheless			0
society ca n't function without power			1
’ launched in 2008 , the risk register assesses threats that are likely to endanger human welfare , the environment or security in @entity3			0
it is the public version of the @entity91 , which is classified			0
volcanic eruptions have been added to the list since the last edition in 2010			0
@entity98 from the april 2010 eruption of @entity8 's @entity97 volcano grounded @entity100 air travel for several days			0
but the @entity3 government says a more serious risk is posed by an effusive , or gas - rich , eruption			0
the 1783 - 84 @entity105 eruption in @entity8 sent out noxious gases that spread as smog across @entity100 , causing crop failures , famine and thousands of deaths			0
the government said such an eruption ‘ is now one of the highest - priority risks ’ @entity3 faces			0
@entity97 : the @entity8 volcano grounded air traffic over @entity100 in 2010			0

radiation from the @entity27 can knock out power grids and gps systems
