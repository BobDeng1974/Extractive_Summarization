president @entity1 's party , having been pushed aside in the last election , will slide into the minority in the @entity4 next week when @entity5 reconvenes , giving republicans full control of the legislative branch			1
but @entity1 still has a powerful weapon in his arsenal - the presidential veto - and in an interview with @entity13 that aired this morning he warned @entity15 he will use it if they come after his trademark legislation			1
' i have n't used the veto pen very often since i 've been in office , partly because legislation that i objected to was typically blocked in the @entity4 even after ... republicans took over the @entity24 , ' he said			1
' now i suspect there are going to be some times where i 've got to pull that pen out			1
' and i 'm going to defend gains that we 've made in health care ; i 'm going to defend gains that we 've made on environment and clean air and clean water , ' @entity1 added			2
' now i suspect there are going to be some times where i 've got to pull that pen out , ' he added			1
@entity1 sat for the interview with @entity13 before leaving for his annual , @entity46 vacation , which he is still on @entity1 again said he 'd rather work with @entity15 than against them , however , and he 's ' hopeful ' that @entity48 leaders @entity49 , @entity24 speaker , and @entity51 , the incoming @entity4 majority leader , will take the same approach			1
' i want to get things done			0
i do n't have another election to run , ' he said , moments before vowing to be ' as aggressive as i can be in getting legislation passed that i think help move the economy forward and help middle - class families			0
' but the president may have already ' poisoned the well ' for bipartisan action in some areas , according to @entity15			0
after the @entity48 wiped enough @entity64 off the map in the midterm elections to gain a majority of seats in the @entity4 , @entity1 took executive action to enforce his favored immigration reforms in a move that @entity15 have attacked as unconstitutional			1
in memorandums distributed to the @entity73 last month @entity1 ordered the agency to stop deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity76 as children before 2010 , as well the parents of legal @entity76 residents			0
the directives are expected to effectively protect as many as 5 million immigrants illegally residing in the country from removal until a new president takes office in two years and decides to extend authorization allowing them stay or send them back to their native countries			0
republicans on @entity92 begged @entity1 to leave the policy making to @entity5 and cautioned him that by taking matters into his own hands he would destroy any chance of a working relationship with their party			1
@entity1 acted anyway , and next week he 'll get to see if he called their bluff or stirred the pot. the president told @entity13 that just because he and @entity15 ' disagree on one thing [ that ] should n't prohibit us from getting progress on the areas where there 's some overlap			1
' ' now you 've got @entity15 in a position where it 's not enough for them simply to grind the wheels of @entity5 to a halt and then blame me , ' he said			1
' they are going to be in a position in which they have to show that they can responsibly govern , given that they have significant majorities in both chambers			0
' in a statement responding to @entity1 's interview with @entity13 , @entity121 put the onus on the president to determine how much @entity48 - passed legislation actually becomes law			1
' bipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the president 's desk , and he 'll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class , ' @entity121 told the @entity137			0
' there 's a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies do n't like			2
' you 've been warned : @entity1 said at his year - end presser earlier this month that @entity15 on @entity92 will ' meet stiff resistance ' from him if they try to repeal @entity149 and his other trademark legislation since november 's elections @entity1 has been waving his veto pen in the face of @entity15 , lest they follow through on their promise to use their newly established power to dismantle the @entity149 , also known as @entity149			1
' on health care , there are certainly some lines i ’m going to draw			0
repeal of the law i wo n’t sign , ' @entity1 told reporters a day after his party 's downfall in the midterms			2
' efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we 're not going to support			0
' @entity175 , he said , ' in some cases there may be recommendations that @entity15 have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law , and i ’ll be very honest with them about that and say , look , the law does n't work if you pull out that piece or that piece			1
' the president indicated that he would be ' very open and receptive ' to ' responsible ' changes to the health care reform law that improve on it , though , and ' make it work better			0
' ' there ’s no law that 's ever been passed that is perfect , ' he said , and ' there are some other areas where we think we can do even better			0
' but what i will remind them is that despite all the contention , we now know that the law works			0
' @entity1 again threatened @entity15 with presidential vetos at his year - end presser ahead earlier this month just before he jetted off with his family for a vacation in @entity205			2
' if @entity15 seek to take health care away from people who just got it , they will meet stiff resistance from me , ' he assured reporters			0
' if they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis , i will say no. ' and i ’m confident that i ’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions , ' he said			0
it would take a two - thirds majority in both chambers of @entity5 to overcome a presidential veto			1
with just 54 members of the @entity4 in their column , the @entity48 would need to convince a dozen @entity64 to join them in defying the president in order to overwrite his check on their powers			2
and despite winning their largest majority in the @entity24 since @entity231 , @entity15 have nowhere near enough seats in the @entity24 to challenge a presidential veto			2
roughly four dozen @entity64 would have to append their names to @entity48 - backed legislation in order to reach the requisite number of yea votes , a very unlikely scenario .			2

' i have n't used the veto pen very often since i 've been in office , ' he said
' now i suspect there are going to be some times where i 've got to pull that pen out , ' he said specifically *referencing* @entity48 threats on @entity149
@entity1 again said he 'd rather work with @entity15 than against them , however , and he 's ' hopeful ' that @entity48 leaders will take the same approach
it takes a two - thirds majority in both chambers of @entity5 to overwrite a veto ; republicans do n't have a large enough majority to do it alone
