by @entity0 at first the laughs are , perhaps understandably , nervous			0
but then @entity2 is far from a conventional stand - up comic			1
for a start , he does n’t utter a single word on stage			2
@entity2 , who has cerebral palsy , can not speak so he uses a text - to - speech @entity9 app to deliver his lines			1
during his show , @entity14 , lines are delivered in the synthetic tones of a computer - generated male voice			1
‘ when i realised i ’d never be able to talk again , i was speechless , ’ he jokes , to chuckles from the audience			0
in a recent stunt at the @entity21 auditions , he used an @entity9 to deliver a rendition of @entity24 ’s @entity23			1
unfortunately , the judges did n’t see the funny side , and he was cut short after a few verses			0
still , the experience has made ripe material for his act : ‘ i used to be in a disabled @entity32 tribute band			0
we faced an uphill struggle			0
’ at this the audience erupts with laughter			0
keys to success : @entity41 stand - up comedian @entity2 working on new material on his @entity9 at his flat in @entity44 upon @entity45 last night , @entity2 was in @entity46 for a gig in @entity48			1
our interview is conducted via a specialised computer called a @entity52 rather than the @entity9 app , which is ‘ more fun for the show , but harder to type on – this is what i use in everyday life ’ , says @entity2			1
the @entity52 is portable and has two screens so i can see the words as @entity2 writes them			1
i ask a question and after a few taps of the keypad , the computer voice replies			0
he says : ‘ i ’ve always loved stand - up but i never thought about trying it myself until friends suggested that it might work and that i ’d be unique			1
‘ i ’m comfortable making fun of myself			0
people do n’t expect it and there ’s that awkward feeling in the room initially when i get on stage			2
but when i ’m funny that goes away			0
’ @entity2 ’s first gig was at a friend ’s comedy night in @entity79 in february and he has been overwhelmed at the positive response so far – he recently supported @entity81 on tour , while @entity84 star @entity83 is a fan			1
now he is planning a tour of his own next year			0
‘ i was very nervous			0
i thought no one would understand me , ’ explains @entity2			1
‘ after a few minutes of it going well i started to enjoy it			0
it was a massive buzz knowing people were laughing at stuff i ’d written			0
i managed only two hours ’ sleep afterwards because i was on such a high			2
’ cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a range of neurological conditions that affect movement , co-ordination and speech			1
it is caused by damage to the brain that can happen during pregnancy , birth or soon after			0
about 2,000 children a year are affected in the @entity107			0
tools : @entity2 uses his @entity9 or a @entity52 device ( left ) to communicate aged six months , @entity2 contracted the brain infection encephalitis – triggered by a cold sore – which put him in a coma for two weeks			1
it left him with @entity113 , a common type of cerebral palsy			1
@entity2 ’s right side is much weaker than his left , which means he walks with a limp			1
he finds it hard to swallow and the muscles in his mouth and tongue are too weak for him to speak – despite years of working with a speech therapist in early childhood			1
about three - quarters of people with cerebral palsy suffer from some sort of speech difficulty			1
@entity2 , who grew up in @entity128 , attended a specialist primary school where he learned sign language			1
aged 12 , he was given his purpose - built @entity52			2
despite its @entity133 accented voice , you can still detect a hint of @entity136 in his syntax and with words such as @entity139 , which he spells phonetically			0
‘ i take the @entity52 for granted now , but it changed my life and made me a lot more independent , ’ says @entity2 , who works at @entity142 ’s press office			2
‘ it ’s frustrating that i ca n’t just instantly say something , that i have to type it out first – although if i ’m angry that can be a good thing			0
’ despite his disability , teachers at his primary school realised @entity2 was very bright and needed to be challenged.when he was old enough , he was able to attend many lessons at a mainstream secondary school , and he went on to gain a place at the @entity156 to study journalism			2
‘ luckily i had a really good @entity163 teacher who pushed me to my limits			0
i ’ve always loved writing and @entity163 and until now journalism was all i ever wanted to do , ’ says @entity2 , who has had stints as a sports reporter for his local newspaper and the @entity161			2
‘ i always seem to choose strange careers for someone who ca n’t speak			2
’ he is able to do most of his research via email but uses his @entity52 device to conduct interviews over the phone			0
‘ some people just assume i ’m an answering machine or get impatient but i ’m used to it and it ’s turned into great comedy material , ’ he says			0
@entity179 , a trustee of the charity communication matters , which offers support to people who use augmentative communication , says : ‘ there ’s a huge range of ability among those with cerebral palsy , going from those whose speech is clear but laboured , to those who are unintelligible and rely on speech aids			1
’ the charity campaigns for better recognition and support for people such as @entity2 and is lobbying the government to protect speech - therapy services			1
@entity179 says : ‘ thirty or 40 years ago before devices such as @entity9 were developed , people had to rely on parents and carers to talk for them			2
those with cerebral palsy were thought to be stupid			1
@entity2 is part of the first generation to grow up with more options open to them			2
‘ it ’s very courageous to put himself up there as different – that takes a certain personality			0
but what @entity2 is doing is more than that – he is breaking down barriers			2

@entity2 has cerebral palsy and can not speak - but still managed to become a stand - up comic
@entity2 uses a text - to - speech @entity9 app to deliver his lines on stage
