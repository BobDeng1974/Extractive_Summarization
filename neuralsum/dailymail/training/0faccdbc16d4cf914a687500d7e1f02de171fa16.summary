construction will begin in @entity1 this week on the first 29 - mile segment of the @entity4 - to - @entity5 bullet train track after two years of delays and court battles			1
the $ 68 - billion project has been dogged by political and legal opposition , with the @entity10 having to win a series of court challenges in order to secure funding and begin works			1
but despite a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled to take place tuesday , rail officials are yet to secure the funds needed to complete the initial system over the next 14 years			1
construction will begin in @entity1 this week on the first 29 - mile segment of the @entity4 - to - @entity5 bullet train track after a two year fight the two - year delay has largely been caused by problems acquiring land			1
the state still only has 101 of the needed 526 parcels for the first 29 miles			1
agreements with two of the nation 's most powerful private freight railroads , concerned about how the network will affect them , are also yet to be reached			0
rail board chairman @entity34 told the @entity35 that despite the challenges ahead ' we feel very confident that this program is going to go forward '			2
the groundbreaking will be led by gov. @entity40 who sees the project as an important part of his leadership legacy			2
the concept originated during @entity40 's first term			0
making the idea a reality , has proved to be one of the most difficult and contentious in recent state history			0
@entity50 , a @entity51 professor emeritus of urban planning , said the high - speed rail authority had ' overcome quite a lot ' to get this far , but still had ' enormous hurdles ahead of them '			2
the largest , he said , was securing funding to start a statewide system			0
in 2008 , voters approved a $ 9 - billion bond measure			2
the @entity63 administration then chipped in added grants of $ 3.2 billion			0
then , last year , the @entity65 agreed to provide 25 per cent of future greenhouse gas — or cap - and - trade — fees , which could produce $ 250 million to $ 1 billion annually for the bullet train			1
@entity50 , a @entity51 professor emeritus of urban planning , said the high - speed rail authority had ' overcome quite a lot ' to get this far , but still had ' enormous hurdles ahead of them ' if the line is completed on schedule for 2028 , only $ 26 billion would have been raised			1
not even half the estimated cost , which is expected to rise as further delays and problems arise			0
mr @entity50 said the costs were ' surrounded by uncertainty '			0
he told the newspaper : ' the public should understand that the uncertainties are much greater than the certainties			0
but our political process does n't allow us to say ' we do n't know what it will cost or how long it will take , but let 's get started anyway			0
' mr @entity34 , the rail board 's chairman , acknowledged that the project needed billions more in funding , but said that could be offset by money it could make through advertising and real estate developments along the route			1
the high - speed rail link is scheduled to be completed by 2028 and is expected to cost $ 68 billion the state is counting on private investors to fund about a third of the system , but they are unlikely to commit until at least part of the system is up and running successfully			1
mr @entity34 said a bridge over the @entity108 would be the first piece of major construction and that might not start until april			0
a further problems is that under federal funding requirements , billion dollar grants from both @entity114 and the state will need to be spent by october 2017 , meaning construction will need to proceed at high speed			0
over the next 1,000 days the state will have to spend at a rate of $ 3 million to $ 4 million every calendar day			1
any unspent federal funds would have to be returned , although mr @entity34 said he ' does n't expect to leave any money on the table ' .			2

a groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to take place in @entity1 *tomorrow*
rail officials have n't secured the funds needed to complete the initial route
they only have 101 of the 526 parcels of land needed for the first 29 miles
over the next 1,000 days they will have to spend $ 3 - 4 million a day
