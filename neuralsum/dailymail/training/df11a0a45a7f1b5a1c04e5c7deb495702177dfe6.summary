nibbling contentedly at a twig , this beaver is one of a group caught in an unprecedented conservation battle			2
at least ten have made their home on the banks of a @entity9 river , to the delight of wildlife lovers			1
but the first beavers to breed in the wild in @entity14 for 800 years face a threat from an unexpected quarter – the men from the ministry			1
this exclusive @entity19 photograph captures on the @entity21 beavers in close up for the first time for officials from the environment department , @entity25 , say the creatures must be caught and culled or rehomed in zoos			1
they claim the beavers , which have been living and breeding on a 12 - mile stretch of the @entity21 for at least five years , may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health			1
@entity35 has issued licences for pest controllers to round them up and cages have already been bought			1
but wildlife experts and conservationists have begun a court battle to save the beavers and 12,000 people have signed a petition to back their cause			1
environmental charity @entity46 has started legal action in a bid to block @entity25 , claiming that rounding up the beavers would be illegal			1
it says they are protected under @entity52 law and alternatives to their removal have not been properly considered			0
the @entity55 agrees the beavers should be caught and tested for disease , but wants them returned to the river afterwards and has submitted a proposal to monitor them for a further five years			1
the trust ’s @entity61 said : ‘ they do not have a big negative impact			0
they have been there for four or five years and nobody has noticed , let alone complained			0
@entity68 have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers			0
‘ they provide habitats for other species			0
our rivers are not in great health and one solution is to have these natural engineers back in our watercourses			2
’ @entity46 campaigner @entity80 said : ‘ at a time when our wildlife is facing an unprecedented crisis , the government should be taking steps to protect and expand the range of key native species like the beaver – not removing them			0
officials have claimed that beavers may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health ‘ beavers can bring many benefits – as well as injecting a little more joy into our landscape			1
’ retired environmental scientist @entity100 , who spotted the first of the beaver group near @entity103 a year ago , said : ‘ there is an overwhelming majority of people are in favour of the beavers staying and being left alone by the government			2
’ beavers were wiped out by hunters in the @entity112 and their reappearance in @entity9 remains a mystery			1
there are several captive breeding programmes , one 30 miles away			0
but none of the animals is missing			0
a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ the beavers on the @entity21 may carry a disease which could pose a risk to human health			1
that is why it ’s our responsibility to take precautionary action			0
’ a bid to reintroduce beavers to the wild in @entity130 is considered an outstanding success and has caused no threat to other species			2
five families were trapped in @entity135 and released into the remote forests and lochs of @entity138 in @entity139 in 2009 and 2010			0
some died and some disappeared but others bred and 14 young – known as kits – have been born			0
the beavers have engineered dams 60ft long , while the biggest lodge is as large as a double garage			2
their presence has boosted local tourism , with more than 30,000 people taking part in walks , talks and education sessions and more than 200 school and college visits			0
those running the five - year trial say it has shown that beavers can live and breed in the @entity130 countryside			2
the results will be presented to the @entity165 , which is expected to give the go ahead for the programme to be expanded			0
however , it could also shut the project and order the beavers to be put down , or trapped and taken to a zoo .			1

officials from @entity25 say beavers must either be culled or rehomed in a zoo
add that they may carry diseases that could pose a risk to human health
at least 10 beavers are living on a stretch of @entity21 in @entity9
@entity35 has now issued licences for pest controllers to round them up
