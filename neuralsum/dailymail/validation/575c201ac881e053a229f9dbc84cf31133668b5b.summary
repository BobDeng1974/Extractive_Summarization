@entity1 manager @entity0 is confident fatigue will not hamper their bid for a top - four place despite an arduous season so far			1
@entity8 commitments and a run to the semi-final of the @entity11 , in addition to their continued involvement in the @entity14 , means the @entity15 have played 46 matches this season			1
that is already three more than in the whole of the previous campaign , which saw them fall agonisingly short of winning the @entity22			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) in talks with @entity24 during training @entity0 shares a laugh with @entity28 defender @entity27 ( left ) during the session @entity30 works on his fitness and conditioning with @entity1 coach @entity33 ( left ) @entity1 pair @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 strike a pose during the training esssion such a toll manifested itself in a sluggish performance last weekend in a goalless @entity14 quarter - final at home to @entity42 - their third match in six days including an early - morning return from @entity46			1
however , with an eight - day break , during which the players were given some much - needed time off , @entity0 believes they will be firing on all cylinders on his return to former club @entity53 on monday			1
' our last performance against @entity42 was at the end of a real tough period of games , ' said the manager			2
' i 've seen all the numbers and all the statistics on it and , physically , it was the lowest we have been for this season			2
now we 're re-energised and refreshed mentally and physically			0
' we go into a run of games now , starting with @entity53 , and we feel we can go in and push on in terms of our level of performance again			1
we know it will be tough			0
' it 's that period of the season where you taper your training			2
you do n't need to be as long in your training and preparation as the players have got a real good level of fitness , so it 's more explosive and more intensive , but in shorter blocks			0
' the players have been brilliant this week			0
they 're looking really sharp , looking really confident and we just want to continue with our sequence of performances and good results			0
' @entity1 captain @entity86 is back in contention for the trip to @entity53 after an injury layoff @entity90 central defender @entity30 jumps to power a header in during the session at @entity93 vice captain @entity94 in action alongside @entity30 ( right ) during a training drill captain @entity86 trains ahead of team - mates @entity98 ( left ) and right back @entity100 ( centre ) @entity1 are the form team of 2015 , having not lost in the league since mid-december , when they were 10th and seven points off fourth , in a run which has seen them take 30 points from a possible 36			1
they are now only seven points off second place but @entity0 knows with @entity108 - whom they play next weekend - to catch and @entity110 and @entity111 chasing them there is still plenty of work to do			1
' i think it 's going to be very tight , of course , ' he said			0
' we 've rejoined the race for that in the last three months and everything counts in the games			0
' we just need to ensure we continue to be aggressive in our game and give everything that we have between now and the end of the season			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity128 ( left ) vies for possession with left back @entity130 @entity1 striker @entity131 strikes one on the volley with his left foot during training @entity15 @entity136 goalkeeper @entity135 gets down low to his right to stop the ball with his hand @entity1 left back @entity140 all smiles during saturday 's session at @entity93 ' the points total is all very close and very tight but we just have to continue playing and working as hard as we have done			1
' if you 're a team that wants to do well , you have to be able to have that character , resolve and mentality to win away from home			0
' we 've got great counter-attack speed when the space does open up and we 've got technically - gifted players who can play in the spaces			0
we 're in a good moment , but we respect it 'll be a very difficult game at @entity53			2
