' ' all the vitriol that he spewed in my direction over dinner was real , ' @entity11 said			1

' @entity34 kept ' pointing his finger at my chest and saying the @entity2 and @entity81 exercise was a provocation to war and of course not being a diplomat , my reaction was to lean back across the table and point my finger at his chest			0

at the end , @entity11 was presented with the bill , according to the @entity96 - though he did n't disclose how much it was for , or whether service was included			1

he said people labored with old - fashioned tools and were eerily going about their business dressed in drab clothes			0
' it was kind of creepy about how impassive everyone was			0
they did n't show any emotion , did n't stop to greet each other ... i did n't see anyone conversing or laughing , ' he said			0
