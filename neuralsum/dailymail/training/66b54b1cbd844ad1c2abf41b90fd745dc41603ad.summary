@entity1 , 17 , also posted violent , racist and anti-gay comments			1
she was appointed last week to the £ 15,000 taxpayer - funded post to represent young people ’s views on policing			1
but politicians last night insisted that her position was untenable after her disgusting outbursts were revealed by @entity23			0
in one she appears to condone drug - taking , revealing : ‘ i really wan na make a batch of hash brownies			1
’ elsewhere she complains : ‘ worst part about being single is coming from a party / night out horny as f * * * and having to sleep alone			1
’ another says : ‘ been drinking since half 1 and riding baby walkers down the hall at work oh my god i have the best job ever haha ! ! ’ and in one vile message , she says : ‘ i want to f * * * * * * cut everyone around me			1

’ and in another she boasted : ‘ am getting so drunk this saturday , so so painfully oh so unattractively drunk			2
’ the comments come from a personal @entity74 account , @entity75 @ vilulabelle , where she had posted or circulated more than 4,000 messages and images , many of them offensive			0
outbursts : @entity81 and local crime commissioner @entity82 ( right ) has defended the teenager and asked for some perspective due to miss @entity1 's age			1
the pair are pictured after miss @entity1 was appointed to the role yet only days ago miss @entity1 pledged in a series of television interviews to change perceptions of young people who , she insisted , were mostly ‘ lovely ’			1
miss @entity1 ’s comments represent a further blow to police credibility , which was undermined last week by @entity96 ’s disclosures about @entity98 @entity97 , who sued a burglary victim after tripping over a kerb at his petrol station			1
miss @entity1 was hired to cover @entity81 and was interviewed by the county ’s assistant chief constable			1

@entity122 , chairman of the @entity123 , said : ‘ i am deeply shocked by these disclosures			2
this individual must be removed from their post immediately			1
public money should never be given to anyone who refers to violence , sex , drunkenness and other anti-social behaviour in this offensive manner			2
the government must now reconsider its point blank refusal to publish a national list of all the appointments made by @entity139 – as requested by my committee			2
‘ the public has a right to know who they are , how they were appointed and their full backgrounds			2
that is the best way to stop irresponsible and unsuitable people being taken on			2
’ however mrs @entity82 defended her young adviser , and insisted that she should remain in her post			2
‘ you can not condone any offensive tweets and i certainly would not accept anything like that now that @entity75 has been appointed but i wanted somebody for this job who was a typical teenager , ’ she said			0
she added : ‘ there is no way i would think of removing her from her post and i am sure @entity75 will learn from this mistake and be able to move forward to making a success of the role like i know she will			0
’ miss @entity1 , who is not old enough to vote or legally purchase alcohol , was chosen from 164 hopefuls who applied for the position that was advertised in february this year			2
she was encouraged to apply for the role by bosses at @entity171 in @entity81 , where she earns £ 2.65 an hour in a full - time apprenticeship role as an office junior			0
the final part of the selection process involved an interview with mrs @entity82 and @entity177 , the chief inspector of @entity81			0

miss @entity1 claimed that she chose to put on hold plans to do a-levels to take up the year - long post			1
however in another posting she told of her intention to work as a holiday rep on the @entity201 island of @entity202 or the @entity204 island of @entity205 , both renowned for their hedonistic , party atmosphere			0
creating a youth police and crime commissioner role was a manifesto pledge of mrs @entity82 , who said : ‘ young people do n’t have much of a voice in policing in @entity81 and i ’m determined to change that			1
‘ @entity75 is going to be the young face of policing in the county and i ’m quite sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect with young people			1
‘ she ’s very exceptional			0
she has a real commitment to working with young people			1
she ’s confident and she ’s got bags of energy			0
’ but miss @entity1 appeared to be aware that her personal tweets could be damaging to her professional reputation			2
her comments and @entity74 account were deleted yesterday , after the @entity227 contacted her			0
and last week she started an official @ @entity74 account and a new personal account , @ parisbrownn , explaining to friends that the accounts would be used ‘ for work ’			0
last night miss @entity1 told @entity234 : ‘ when i tweet i do often exaggerate and , to clarify , i am not racist or sexist but i ’m not going to lie – i have been guilty of showing off in the past			2
‘ when i sit indoors with my mum i will have a small glass of wine every now and again but i ’m not an alcoholic			0
‘ you are allowed to drink at home			0
at a family meal or maybe at @entity243 i will have a glass of wine or maybe a @entity246 and lemonade but i do n’t have a drinking problem , i do n’t condone drinking to excess			0
‘ i have never taken drugs and i do n’t condone anyone taking drugs			0
the tweet i wrote about making hash brownies is actually a line from a @entity257 film and not something i would ever do			1
’ mrs @entity82 added : ‘ @entity75 may have in the past been stupid and made some spur of the moment comments which i certainly do not condone but she has matured quickly into a very confident and mature young woman			2
‘ i am sure she will be ashamed of these comments but i would bet you that any parent who accessed a @entity74 or @entity267 account would be surprised and perhaps shocked at some of the stuff that ’s on it because that ’s what kids do			0
‘ they like to impress their mates and i imagine @entity75 has been found guilty of boasting in many of these messages			0
