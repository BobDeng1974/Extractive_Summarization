by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent sir @entity2 branded @entity3 ' a national disgrace ' @entity3 has been branded a ' national disgrace ' by @entity7 's chief inspector , who said the city is one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world			1
sir @entity2 highlighted the infant mortality rate in @entity14 ’s second city , which is higher than @entity15 's and almost twice the national average			1
he singled @entity3 out in a scathing report that found 20 areas in @entity19 where councils do not have ‘ the most basic acceptable practice in place ’			1
sir @entity2 blamed @entity3 , where a third of children live in poverty , for ‘ failure of corporate governance on a grand scale ’			1
@entity3 recently published a review of the cruel murder of two - year - old @entity32 by his mother in 2011			2
his case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students			0
@entity37 , one of the 20 to be classed as ' inadequate ' , has now failed on seven inspection judgements , @entity7 said			1
sir @entity2 said : ‘ it is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look at this with real urgency			1
if better governance means breaking [ the department ] up so children are better protected , then that ’s what needs to happen			2
’ he added : ‘ why is it that nearly a third of children in the city live in households on low incomes ? why is it that infant mortality is almost twice the national average , worse than in @entity15 and on a par with @entity59 and @entity60 ? ‘ these are shocking statistics and a national disgrace			1
they are a testament to failure of corporate governance on a grand scale			1
‘ what is shocking is that this is the city council with responsibility for more children than any other , our second city , the largest unitary local authority in the country			0
‘ this is a city that should be nipping at @entity78 ’s heels for power , status and influence			0
’ he implied that the council would work better to protect children if it was smaller , saying : ' as somebody said about the banks not so long ago , if they are too big to fail , they are too big			1
the same could be said about this council			0
two - year - old @entity32 ( left ) was beaten to death by his mother @entity89 ( right )			0
a review into his death found his case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students ' it is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look at this with real urgency			0
if better governance means breaking it up so that children are better protected , then that 's what needs to happen			2
' the chief inspector spoke as @entity7 released its first report on @entity19 ’s 152 children ’s services departments			0
just 3 per cent of councils were rated as ' outstanding ' and 86 - more than half - were deemed to be ' less than good '			0
the report highlights that across @entity19 700,000 children live in a home with an alcoholic parent , 100,000 children have parents who are being treated for a hard drug addiction , 130,000 live in domestically violent homes and there are 17,000 children living with a parent who has a severe or enduring mental illness			0
sir @entity2 said children ’s services had been undermined because one in three departmental directors have either quit or been sacked in the past year – 50 out of 152			1
‘ @entity126 and ineffective leadership must be addressed quickly , ’ he added			0
‘ but where those in leadership positions have capacity and potential , this must be recognised and nurtured			0
’ @entity37 has now failed on seven inspection judgements			1
pictured : council buildings the report found 86 of the 152 councils had children ’s services that were ‘ less than good ’			2
a spokesman for @entity3 council said : ‘ we are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe			2
' this is a long - standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children 's services is his number one priority			0
' while we can only agree with the seriousness of what sir @entity2 has said with regard to children 's services - indeed we have said it ourselves - we now need improvement rather than further diagnosis lacking any offer of solutions			1
' we must work with @entity7 on this and we repeat our determination to improve the safety of children in this city as the highest priority for this council			2
' the 20 judged inadequate were @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity3 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 on @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 .			0
