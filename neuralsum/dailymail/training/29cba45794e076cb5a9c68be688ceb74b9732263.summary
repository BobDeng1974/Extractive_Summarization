by @entity0 they are remembered as the ' noble six hundred ' who rode ' into the mouth of @entity5 ' with unwavering valour in one of the @entity10 military 's most infamous disasters			1
the bravery and unquestioning loyalty exhibited in the doomed @entity13 - immortalised by @entity14 , @entity15 in his poem of the same name - caused a sensation in @entity18 when news reached home			2
but it has now emerged that , even as the order was given , it was obvious to the rank and file risking their lives in the face of @entity29 artillery that - in @entity15 's words - ' someone had blunder 'd '			1
wild charge : the letters have shown ordinary soldiers ' reactions to the @entity13			1
the above picture shows a 1936 film adaptation letters written by some of the 673 soldiers involved in the ill - fated assault have been unearthed 150 years after the assault , which took place during the @entity45 in 1854			1
they describe the folly of the order to charge into the famed ' @entity49 ' - surrounded on three sides by massed @entity29 forces - but also show how the brave @entity53 forces threw themselves into the battle nonetheless			1
one correspondent referred to the order - which is thought to have been given because of a misunderstanding - as ' perfect madness '			0
another , identified as private @entity59 of the @entity60 , clearly thought the command was an accident			0
writing to his parents in @entity53 , he said : ' i could see what would be the result of it , and so could all of us ; but of course , as we had got the order , it was our duty to obey			0
carnage : the @entity13 , in 1854 , is one of @entity10 's most notorious military disasters ' i do not wish to boast too much ; but i can safely say that there was not a man in the @entity13 that day but what did his duty to his queen and country			1
' the correspondence was unearthed by @entity45 historian @entity82 , who scoured newspaper archives to find published accounts from the soldiers involved			1
the full collection is due to be published this june in a book called @entity88 from the @entity13			2
among the unnamed witnesses to the carnage were an unnamed officer from the @entity92 , who described the unblinking loyalty of his comrades			0
he wrote : ' we all knew the thing was desperate before we started , and it was even worse than we thought ... however there was no hesitation , down our fellows went at a gallop - through a fire in front and on both flanks , which emptied our saddles and knocked over our horses by scores			0
' chaos : @entity109 was decimated by @entity111 artillery fire on three flanks the charge , one of the best - known blunders in @entity10 military history , came in the thick of the @entity116 , near @entity117 in @entity118 - then part of @entity111			2
although it only lasted around 20 minutes , the attack saw almost a fifth of the @entity13 killed , and hundreds more wounded			0
it is thought to have come about after @entity123 and the @entity124 , who were in charge of the cavalry in the battle , were given a confusing order by @entity129 , the @entity10 commander			2
@entity109 had been meant to ride to the rescue of @entity10 guns which had been captured and were being dragged away by @entity29 forces			0
but due to a misunderstanding they instead though they had been given the suicidal task of capturing well - defended @entity29 guns much further away			0
as they rode towards the distant emplacement , their men were torn apart by @entity29 marksmen and shell fire			1
to the surprise of their foes , they did manage to reach the massed guns and inflict some damage , but were so depleted that they had to turn back and retreat			0
lord @entity15 's poem , written based on breathless newspaper dispatches from the front , memorably expressed the bravery of ordinary soldiers as they rode to their doom			1
it captured the public mood , and was distributed to soldiers in @entity118 while they were still fighting			0
half a league , half a league / half a league onward , all in the valley of @entity162 / @entity161 the six hundred			0
" forward , the @entity13 ! / " charge for the guns ! " he said : into the valley of @entity162 / @entity161 the six hundred			2
" forward , the @entity13 ! " / was there a man dismay 'd ? not tho ' the soldier knew / someone had blunder 'd : theirs not to make reply , / @entity170 not to reason why , @entity170 but to do and die : / into the valley of @entity174 the six @entity175 to right of them , / @entity172 to left of them , @entity172 in front of them / volley 'd and thunder 'd ; storm 'd at with shot and shell , / boldly they rode and well , into the jaws of @entity162 , / into the mouth of @entity184 the six @entity182 'd all their sabres bare , / flash 'd as they turn 'd in air , sabring the gunners there , / charging an army , whileall the world wonder 'd : / plunged in the battery - smokeright thro ' the line they broke ; / @entity196 and @entity197 'd from the sabre stroke / @entity199 and @entity200 they rode back , but not / not the six @entity175 to right of them , / @entity172 to left of them , @entity172 behind them / volley 'd and thunder 'd ; storm 'd at with shot and shell , / while horse and hero fell , they that had fought so well / came thro ' the jaws of @entity219 from the mouth of @entity5 , / all that was left of them , left of six @entity208 can their glory fade ? / o the wild charge they made ! all the world wondered			1
/ honor the charge they made , honour the @entity13 , / noble six hundred .			2

bloody @entity45 charge in 1854 is an infamous military blunder
the @entity13 cavalry were ordered to charge into heavy @entity29 fire
now new letters *reveal* that ordinary soldiers knew the order was *foolish*
but , in their own words , they tell how the men charged on regardless
