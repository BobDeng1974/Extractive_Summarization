a municipal court judge who resigned after being slammed in a @entity2 report has announced he is stepping down from two more roles			1
@entity4 left his @entity6 position earlier this week after he was directly criticised in the report , which was prompted by the fatal police shooting of @entity9			1
he also left his post as a @entity12 prosecutor			2
he has now announced he will no longer be the prosecuting attorney in @entity13 and @entity14			1
he has also left three other roles			2
state appeals judge @entity20 ( right ) was appointed to take his place in @entity6 the report , released on march 4 , singled out the 70 - year - old and suggested he was behind @entity6 ’s aggressive strategy of using its municipal court to generate revenues			1
it added that @entity4 was particularly ' creative ' when it came to traffic fines and fees , including dismissing tickets for himself and friends			2
announcing his resignation @entity4 said he wanted to help the city ' begin its healing process ' and to promote public confidence in the court			1
@entity20 , a state appeals judge , was appointed by the @entity38 to take his place and make ' needed reforms '			1
@entity41 will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to ' restore the integrity of the system ' and ensure the respect of defendants ' rights , according to the high court			1
he will start on march 16			0
chief justice @entity50 said she believes @entity41 will bring a ' fresh , disinterested perspective ' to the court			1
' he is able and willing to implement needed reforms , ' she said			0
' @entity54 action is warranted in @entity6 , but the court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis			1
' but @entity13 mayor @entity57 said that @entity4 ’s service would be ' dearly missed '			1
a @entity2 investigation found patterns of racial bias in the @entity6 police department and at the municipal jail and court			1
@entity4 stepped down to help the city ' begin its healing process ' , he said two @entity69 commanders - @entity70 and @entity71 - also resigned last thursday after racist emails were discovered by the @entity2 's investigation , while @entity74 , a court clerk , was fired			1
it is unclear whether the three were the recipients or senders of the ' racially biased ' emails included in the 102 - page civil rights report			1
the @entity80 reports that @entity70 was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that president @entity82 would not complete a full presidential term because a black man ca n't hold ' a steady job '			0
@entity71 is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a @entity88 woman was paid by ' @entity89 ' to terminate her pregnancy			0
the @entity2 highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless women dancing , with the caption ' @entity98 's @entity97 '			2
the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the @entity2 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week			0
evidence found shows not only racial bias , ' but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case '			0
in fact , the report states , there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails			0
instead , the emails were forwarded along to others			0
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts			0
sgt. @entity71 ( left ) and capt. @entity70 ( center ) resigned from their positions on thursday			2
@entity134 clerk @entity74 ( right ) was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report @entity17 attorney general @entity137 called the @entity2 's report ' searing ' and said the investigation showed policing and municipal court practices were ' disproportionately harmful to @entity143 residents '			1
he said : ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized			0
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents			0
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue			0
' @entity6 mayor @entity160 revealed last week that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the @entity2 , @entity159 reports			2
@entity160 did not comment on whether police chief @entity164 would step down			0
the @entity2 's investigation into the @entity80 suburb came after a white @entity6 police officer , @entity167 ( right ) , fatally shot an unarmed black teen , @entity9 ( left ) , in august last year the grand jury 's decision not to indict the @entity6 police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast @entity6 's mostly white police force in a negative light the report found that some practices of the @entity69 violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the @entity179 the report highlighted the department 's practices , saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacted on the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of @entity6 's municipal court			1
it states : ' the @entity192 handles most charges brought by the @entity69 , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue			0
' it also highlighted the fact that african - americans make ' extraordinary ' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor , unfairly charged violations			0
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts			0
the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help			2
the clerk responded : ' your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! ' some practices of the @entity69 violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the @entity179 , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .			2
