by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 06:28 est , 28 june 2012 huge magnetic tornadoes over 1,000 miles wide are heating the layer above the surface of the sun to millions of degrees centigrade			1
the scientists hope that the magnetic tornadoes , which channel heat from the sun into a searing layer above its surface , could form the basis of clean reactors on @entity15			1
the super tornadoes - which are thousands of times larger and more powerful than their earthly counterparts and have a magnetic skeleton - spin at speeds of more than 6,000 mph at temperatures in millions of centigrade in the @entity24 's atmosphere			2
the discovery could help explain why the ' atmosphere ' around the sun is hotter than its surface - a puzzle that has mystified scientists			1
telescope images form a tower showing how ' solar tornadoes ' work : the super tornadoes spin at speeds of more than 6,000 mph at temperatures in millions of centigrade in the @entity24 's atmosphere a @entity38 radio telescope captures a ' cross section ' of one of the swirling , 1000 - mile - wide structures they are more than 1,000 miles wide – hundreds of miles longer than the total distance between @entity45 to @entity46			1
it is estimated that there are as many as 11,000 of these swirling events above the @entity24 's surface at any time			1
@entity52 researchers say the solar tornadoes carry the energy from the energy reservoir below the @entity24 's surface , called the convection zone , to the outer atmosphere in the form of magnetic waves			1
professor @entity60 of the @entity52 , said : ‘ if we understand how nature heats up magnetised plasmas , like in the tornadoes observed in the @entity24 , one day we may be able to use this process to develop the necessary technology and build devices on @entity15 that produce free , clean , green energy			1
' because of our collaborative research it looks an essential leap forward is made towards unveiling the secrets about a great and exciting problem in plasma - astrophysics and we are getting closer and closer to find a solution			0
‘ we report here the discovery of ubiquitous magnetic solar tornadoes and their signature in the hottest areas of the @entity24 's atmosphere where the temperature is a few millions of degree kelvin , about thousands of kilometres from the @entity24 's surface			2
this is a major step in the field			0
’ @entity52 researchers say the solar tornadoes carry the energy from the energy reservoir below the @entity24 's surface , called the convection zone , to the outer atmosphere in the form of magnetic waves the tornadoes could help unravel the mystery of why the area above the sun 's surface is hotter than the surface itself the space tornadoes are very magnetic and they operate in plasma			1
plasma is the forth known state of matter , beside solid , liquid and gas and makes around 99 per cent of the known matter of the @entity101			0
the tornados act in a similar way to water does if you take the plug out of a full bath			0
professor @entity60 said : ‘ one of the major problems in modern astrophysics is why the atmosphere of a star , like our own @entity24 , is considerably hotter than its surface ? imagine , that you climb a mountain , e.g. a hill in the @entity118 highlands , and it becomes hotter as you go higher and higher			2
many scientists are researching how to ‘ heat ’ the atmosphere above the surface of the @entity24 , or any other star			0
‘ it is understood that the energy originates from below the @entity24 's surface , but how this massive amount of energy travels up to the solar atmosphere surrounding it is a mystery			2
' we believe we have found evidence in the form of rotating magnetic structures - solar tornadoes - that channel the necessary energy in the form of magnetic waves to heat the magnetised solar plasma			0
it is hoped that the process could be replicated here on @entity15 one day to energise plasma in tokamak that are believed to be a future device to produce completely clean energy			0
’ scientists viewed the solar tornadoes in the outer atmosphere of the @entity24 , stretching thousands of miles from the giant star 's surface by using both satellite and ground - based telescopes			0
they then created 3d - layered seqence of images of the tornadoes and simulated their evolution with state - of - the - art numerical codes using the magnetic imprints detected by their high - resolution , cutting - edge telescopes .			0

find key to mystery of why atmosphere above sun is hotter than its surface
swirling magnetic tornadoes could form basis of ' clean ' reactors on @entity15
11,000 huge tornadoes are active on the sun at any time
