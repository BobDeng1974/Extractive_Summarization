by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 is confident big - name signing @entity4 will not upset the team harmony he has worked hard to nurture during his time at the club			1
the @entity9 pulled off a surprise transfer coup this week in attracting former @entity11 international @entity4 to the @entity12			1
@entity4 has made clear , even at the age of 34 and after winning numerous trophies during his previous 10 years with @entity15 prior to his release this summer , he is eager to make history with @entity3			1
@entity2 , however , has no doubt about the type of player and character @entity4 is , especially after seeing how well he was received by his new team - mates on friday			1
' he 's been welcomed into the group , as you would expect him to be , ' @entity2 said of the 52 - times capped international			1
' the players have been quite excited about the prospect of having somebody of that stature in the game being alongside them			2
' but @entity4 will view himself as one of the players , one of the squad , which is a very positive thing			1
' @entity2 also believes @entity4 will be able to teach him a trick or two given the player 's ' world - wide experience '			1
' i , like anybody , have a capacity to keep learning , ' @entity2 added			2
' certainly if somebody comes with the wealth of experience he has , i will probably - if i 've an open enough mind - continue to learn from people like him			0
' i do n't see that as being anything other than positive			0
managers learn as much from players , as players do from managers and coaches			0
' i 've always had that sort of view , and hopefully i 'll continue to learn from my players as well			0
' whether @entity4 makes his debut in sunday 's home game with @entity78 depends on whether he receives international clearance			1
done deal : @entity4 had been locked in talks with @entity3 after leaving @entity15 over the summer the clash with the @entity83 continues @entity3 's tough run of fixtures to start their return to the @entity87 following a 2 - 2 home draw with @entity89 and 2 - 0 defeat at @entity91			1
@entity2 has told his players what he expects			2
' it is another big game against one of the most successful sides of the modern era in @entity100 football , ' he said			0
' they are a side that has an exceptionally good blueprint as to how a football club should be run			0
' but our philosophy is we have to play to our strengths , without being naive or gung - ho			0
' we have to be ruthless in both penalty boxes to get the better of the top sides			0
' @entity2 is hopeful of attracting two more players to the club before the transfer window closes at 11pm on monday			1
@entity87 bound : the move sees @entity4 make his mark in @entity100 for the first time in his career one of those appears to be @entity120 defender @entity119 , with the other @entity122 striker @entity121			1
' we 'll try and get two more players , ' @entity2 said			2
' if we can do that , fine			0
if we ca n't then , as i 've said in the past , i 'm happy with the players i have			0
' it 's more out of our desire to have a strong enough squad to go from window to window			0
' it 's not that i do n't have faith in the players i have			0
you know i do - i speak about it all the time			2
' i 'm very proud of what this group of players have achieved to get here			0
' aside from the prospect of @entity4 making his debut , @entity2 has midfielders @entity142 and @entity144 and striker @entity145 available again following injuries , but midfielder @entity147 ( shin ) and defender @entity149 ( foot ) are definitely out			1
@entity151 praised @entity3 's play to win mentality			2

@entity3 manager @entity2 believes the signing of @entity4 will not upset team harmony
