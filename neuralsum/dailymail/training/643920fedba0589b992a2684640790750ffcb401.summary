by @entity0 as the @entity3 team crunched to defeat in their first @entity5 match , another inauguration was taking place			1
it was a very special moment in the annals of footballing history , one that we are not going to forget for a long time to come			1
so blow the whistle – wheeeep ! – and remember where you were the night @entity15 made his debut as a commentator for the @entity18			1
top pundit @entity19 sported a slightly longer hair - do during the start of this year 's @entity5 coverage ( left ) compared to the cleaner cut he showed off at an event in october last year ( right ) ‘ it ’s always difficult as an @entity3 supporter to enjoy these occasions , ’ were his prophetic opening words as the game against @entity27 began			1
it was a warning of the horror to unfold over the next ninety minutes			1
with his lips pressed close to the microphone , an intimate clinch of man and metal , @entity15 launched himself on an unsuspecting world without fear , filter or much forethought			1
he wasted no time in mangling his clichés , and managed to keep coma - calm when the first two goals were scored			1
‘ that is what @entity48 is for , to put in crosses like that ’ , he mused as the nation erupted in joy after @entity46 equalised for @entity3			2
he did n’t show a flicker of emotion – or even amusement – when the @entity3 physiotherapist was stretchered off when a celebratory group hug by team officials ended in injury			2
‘ anything can happen if everybody jumps on top of each other , ’ shrugged @entity15			1
even during the most electrifying moments , @entity15 sounded like a depressed undertaker with a giant peg on his nose reading aloud a seed catalogue			2
he spent much of the game mumbling incoherently or with his mouth too close to the mic , as if he was broadcasting in the silent hush of a snooker tournament , or perhaps hiding under the bed from his mum			2
@entity15 made his debut as a commentator for the @entity18 on saturday briefly , he would talk knowledgeably about tactics , of how important it was , say , for @entity3 ’s men to put pressure on the @entity82 midfield			1
then he would ruin it , by savagely attacking the @entity85 language when he thought the ref was n’t looking			2
‘ yeah , he ’s got to fire in them low crosses , ’ he would say			2
indeed , throughout his match commentary , @entity90 would frequently use ‘ them ’ when he actually meant ‘ those ’ – a howling and irritating grammatical error			2
at the very dawn of his career as a pundit , could n’t a producer have had a quiet word in his ear and pointed out the mistake ? this has nothing to do with his regional accent , but everything to do with basic good grammar			1
after all , @entity15 is no longer a footballer			0
he is – for the moment at least – a highly paid voice for the national broadcaster , a man whose every word is being beamed to 15million bemused viewers back home			0
meanwhile , back in the main studio , things were not much better			0
first , what has happened to @entity19 ’s hair ? the @entity18 ’s top pundit now sports great , owlish wings of white furze flowing over the sides of his head , making him look like @entity126			1
the humidity in @entity128 has much more to answer for than players failing to find their pace			1
in @entity19 ’s studio , @entity131 and @entity132 were joined by @entity134			0
i could n’t catch much of what the latter said , but at least he had the excuse of speaking in a second language			0
the other two have no such defence , but do they care ? ‘ he always wanted to play in the middle			0
not on the left or the right - hand side , ’ said @entity131 , carefully explaining for confused viewers exactly where they could find the middle			0
@entity132 either talks rubbish or spouts footy clichés			0
‘ @entity153 opened his legs down the side , ’ he said at one point – a horrifying image			0
@entity156 also wasted no time in explaining yet again how it feels like a completely unique cauldron of seafood when you are actually playing in a match			0
‘ it ’s a totally different kettle of fish once you get on that pitch , ’ he said			0
thank you , @entity156 ! makes you think that @entity15 is n’t so bad after all , though			0
there is only five weeks of this to go .			0

the @entity18 's top pundit now sports hair tufts over the tops of his ears
