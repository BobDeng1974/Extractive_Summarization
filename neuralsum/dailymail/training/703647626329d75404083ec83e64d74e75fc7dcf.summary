by @entity0 published : 21:07 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 29 march 2013 outspoken : comedian @entity1 is never afraid to make a point sitting in the make - up bus on his first day back at work as @entity5 , @entity1 glanced around and saw an extremely ugly looking object			1
‘ it was a polystyrene head with dark grey hair wefts on it , ’ he recalls			2
‘ i did n’t remember there being a tramp character in the script and i wondered what saddo was going to have to put those in his hair			2
’ turns out it was him			2
for while @entity1 and his television alter ego may have once had gorgeous ‘ nut brown golden ’ hair , as he describes it , now it is a different matter			1
both of them are in their late 40s and , if you were being kind , you might describe the colour of their hair as platinum			2
anyway , it did not take much more than a few grey strands to turn @entity5 ’s hair back to its bouncy best , and once @entity1 put on the detective ’s famous duffle coat ( which he had stored in a cupboard at home ) he was straight back into the character he last played three years ago			1
now the super sleuth , a magic tricks creator who specialises in solving seemingly supernatural deaths with a comedy twist , is back not only for a special edition this @entity42 ( this will be its third special since the show ended in 2003 ) , but also a short series that will start filming later this year			2
@entity1 , whose main profile since the show ended has been as a permanent panellist on comedy quiz @entity49 , says he could not be happier			1
‘ @entity5 had n’t been killed off , so there was always a chance the show could come back , ’ he says			1
‘ but the writer @entity54 stopped it when it was in its prime because he had run out of ideas for mysteries , so a new series really came out of the blue			2
sidekick : @entity1 as @entity5 and @entity63 as @entity64 in the new series ‘ i was really pleased			1
in the old days i used to worry about whether i should be doing the show			2
‘ was it wise ? would it be good for me in the long run ? what other roles could i get ? but since then i ’ve discovered it does n’t really work like that			2
‘ you ca n’t really plan your career in this business			2
it tends to go around in cycles			0
you can be in demand or off the map and it ’s not really in your control , so you just have to enjoy it and be grateful when things come your way			1
’ the 47 - year - old @entity84 - born father of two , who started out as a stand - up comedian , admits he is still bitterly disappointed that his comedy @entity87 , in which he starred as a chef , was canned after one series in 2010 despite getting good reviews and ratings			2
at the time he took to @entity92 to vent his fury at the ‘ shoddy ’ way the @entity95 had axed the show			1
today , even though the @entity95 has brought back @entity5 and screens @entity49 , and is therefore his principal employer , @entity1 still does n’t mince his words			1
he ’s never been the type to — even though he has had to apologise to @entity102 peer @entity101 for an untrue allegation he tweeted to his 440,000 followers and , it emerged this week , may still be forced to pay £ 200,000 to make amends			2
this time , he just lowers his voice a little to me in a conspiratorial whisper so that the @entity95 apparatchiks who have organised the interview do n’t hear			1
‘ it ’s impossible to fathom what the thought process is , ’ he says of the @entity95			1
‘ the people who commission shows quite often have n’t produced shows or written shows or made shows in the past			0
all star cast : @entity63 and @entity1 alongside @entity121 and @entity122 ‘ it used to be that people came from the business			1
now they have careers in television ; they go from being a @entity128 to an assistant to being in charge			0
‘ they do n’t even talk to you ; it ’s impossible to get a meeting with them			1
so that means it ’s impossible to know what they want			1
‘ they brought @entity140 back			0
it was hilarious and won a comedy award and then they canned it			0
‘ after @entity145 they only wanted non-audience shows , but now @entity148 and @entity147 are popular they want more of that			0
they do n’t seem to understand that it does n’t really work like that			0
‘ the people in charge are not people with an eye for comedy writing or experience in comedy writing			0
‘ i was really baffled when they ended whites			0
they said : “ we love all of you in the show and now we are firing you			0
” ‘ when i told @entity54 , he said : “ welcome to my world			0
you do n’t know who is in charge or what is going on			0
” ’ he believes that @entity5 was mainly brought back because of its continuing popularity around the world			1
at the moment @entity1 is getting lots of emails from @entity176			1
‘ it sells all over the world and the dvd sales are so huge it ’s a no - brainer when money is tight , ’ he says			1
but that is not to say the @entity95 will be splashing the cash with the new production			1
‘ people always ask about the windmill that @entity5 lives in , but the truth is we have n’t shot in a windmill for years , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s too expensive			2
we ca n’t even afford to use a tv studio			0
@entity191 faced : @entity1 in the fourth series of @entity5 in 2003 ‘ i do n’t even know what tv studios are used for now ; if they are too expensive for us , who is using them ? ‘ now we shoot on an industrial estate in @entity197			1
it ’s not a studio , it ’s not soundproofed and it ’s freezing			2
‘ the way @entity202 gets around it in the script is by using a disused school , which is derelict			0
that means you do n’t have to dress the set up ; you just have to find a derelict building			0
‘ when i sit down and watch @entity208 i think that they must have spent more on their tea sets than we spent on our entire budget			0
the budget has been hacked to bits and everyone is on the same money we were on in the mid-nineties			0
‘ it ’s not that we do n’t get paid ; we get well paid and we like it			2
but it ’s a strange time in television			2
they have got a lot of buildings now , but they should try making some programmes			0
’ money may have been tight ; but the cast list is still impressive			0
for the @entity42 special @entity1 is joined by @entity122 , as a woman who sees her husband ’s dead body in a room before it vanishes ; @entity232 ( the vanishing corpse ) ; @entity121 , who reprises his role as @entity235 ; and the ubiquitous @entity63 , who returns as @entity1 ’s sidekick			1
@entity63 took over from @entity237 , whom @entity1 dated for several years after meeting on the show			1
he is now happily married to writer @entity239 and they have two young children			0
‘ everything changes when you have a family , ’ he sighs			0
‘ i am quite happy now just to go on tour and spend three days a week working and then being able to come home and be with my family			0
’ the storyline in the new @entity5 is as maze - like as ever			1
@entity1 admits he has long given up trying to work out what the ending will be			1
‘ the idea of trying to work it out as you go along is a pointless exercise , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve learned that through the years ; i never work out the ending until the end			0
’ @entity257 flames : @entity1 dated his former co-star @entity237 , who played sidekick @entity259 he believes , though , that a 1998 episode , @entity262 , in which a man jumps off a roof to fake suicide , inspired the makers of @entity268 ’s @entity267 last year			1
in the final episode , @entity269 , played by @entity270 , was seen jumping from a hospital roof , and then sprawled apparently lifeless on the ground			0
yet a few scenes later viewers see he is alive , because he has used trickery to foil his enemies			0
@entity1 says @entity269 used the same idea as @entity5 ’s producers			1
‘ he landed on a removable panel covering a safety net stretched across a trench dug in the ground , ’ he explains			0
he insists that , despite cost cuts , he is certain the viewers will still enjoy the new @entity5 series			1
‘ the good thing about @entity202 [ who also wrote @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 ] is that he will never let standards drop , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ you can still make great stuff without loads of money			0
‘ i would love it to appeal to a new audience			0
i get emails from younger people who watch me on @entity49 and then discover me on @entity5 and write saying , “ you ’re a legend			1
” ‘ i like that			0

@entity1 is returning as @entity5 with a *glamorous* new sidekick
