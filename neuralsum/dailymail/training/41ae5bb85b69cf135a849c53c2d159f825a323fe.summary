@entity1 was settled by a wave of immigrants from @entity4 little more than 4,000 years ago , a genetic study shows			1
the finding overturns the view that the continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000 - 50,000 years ago until @entity9 discovered @entity1 in the eighteenth century			1
dna evidence suggests that rather than complete most of the journey over several generations by foot , the @entity4 migrants came over by boat			1
by the time the @entity4 settlers reached @entity1 the ancient land bridge was under water so they sailed			2
@entity1 ’s first human colonisation was the culmination of the long walk out of @entity22 by the human species			2
humans are believed to have left @entity22 , via the @entity26 coast and through @entity4 before reaching @entity27 and @entity28 and finally over an ancient land bridge to @entity1			2
following their arrival there was , according to ‘ the prevailing view ’ , little if any contact between @entity1 ’s @entity35 inhabitants and the rest of the world			0
but dna evidence has now revealed a second wave of human settlement took place about 4,230 years ago , long before the first @entity9 settled there			1
@entity1 was first seen by a @entity9 in 1606 when it was sighted from a ship and a further 53 vessels arrived before captain @entity45 arrived in 1770 to claim it for @entity47			2
analysis of dna samples from @entity35 people living in the @entity51 of @entity1 today shows that they have up to 11 per cent of their genetic heritage is @entity4 the new settlers came from @entity4 and the lack of their dna in other parts of @entity59 suggests they sailed directly across the @entity60 rather than work their way towards @entity1 by foot			1
scientists found strong evidence of a wave of settlers from @entity4 reaching @entity1 141 generations ago			1
@entity68 who took part in the study were found to have up to 11 per cent of their dna from @entity4 descent			1
intriguingly , their arrival corresponds to evidence in the archaeological record that shows dingos reached @entity1 about the same time , suggesting they may have been transported by boat by the human settlers			0
dr @entity78 , of the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , said the international research team calculated that the @entity4 dna reached the @entity35 population 141 generations ago			1
assuming that each generation is separated on average by 30 years the geneticists were able to conclude that the @entity4 population arrived on in @entity1 4230 years ago			1
@entity45 was born in @entity89 , in @entity90 , in 1728			0
he worked for a shopkeeper before joining the @entity92			0
in 1768 he set off in @entity93 , a former collier , on a secret mission to find land for @entity97 in 1770 @entity45 located the east coast of @entity1 named it @entity99 and claimed it for @entity47			0
he was killed in 1779 by islanders on @entity101			0
‘ interestingly this date also coincides with many changes in the archaeological record of @entity1 , which include a sudden change in plant processing and stone tool technologies , with microliths appearing for the first time , and the first appearance of the dingo in the fossil record , ’ she said			0
‘ since we detect inflow of genes from @entity4 into @entity1 at around the same time , it is likely that these changes were related to this migration			2
’ @entity119 , a geneticist at the @entity120 , led the study and told @entity122 : ‘ @entity1 is thought to represent one of the earliest migrations for humans after they left @entity22 , but it seemed pretty isolated after that			0
’ dna from 344 people was analysed for the study , published in the journal @entity130			0
samples were taken from people in @entity133 , @entity59 , @entity134 , the @entity135 and @entity1 ’s @entity51			0
the dingo is thought to have reached @entity1 with humans about 4,230 years ago .			1

genes reveal that a wave of @entity4 migrants arrived 4,230 years ago
up to 11 per cent of @entity143 derives from @entity4
an earlier wave of migrants arrived about 45,000 years ago
