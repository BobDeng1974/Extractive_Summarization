by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 27 october 2013 i am creeping through the streets of @entity4 , one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in @entity7 , like a night stalker			1
wearing military fatigues and a bullet - proof vest , and brandishing my weapon , i dash behind a tree			1
there is a helicopter circling overhead , its beam illuminating the neighbourhood			2
suddenly , i spot my target darting behind a huge metal industrial rubbish bin			2
i approach slowly and as i shine my torch down the narrow gap , i realise i have him cornered			2
i can see the whites of his eyes , glowing like orbs in the darkness , as he cowers and trembles in the corner			2
my target is a brown terrier mongrel			2
now i have to catch him and just hope that he does n’t bite			2
best freinds : @entity0 walks with two of her canine companions so i start yawning and licking my lips as i get closer			1
i went on an animal behaviour course and this is apparently one way to relax a dog			2
but as i do it , i feel like a total maniac			2
as i crawl on my hands and knees through smelly litter with a cheeseburger in my mouth , this is n’t what i imagined i would be doing when i moved to @entity7 four years ago			2
i am an animal rescuer			2
like a demented @entity48 , i will take in any creature great or small that is in distress or homeless			1
i will rehabilitate the creature and then find it a new home			2
from featherless chickens from a butcher to a box of kittens , my home is a revolving door			2
( @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 the chickens are all living happily on a ranch and their feathers have grown back , i am happy to report )			2
but rescuing dogs is my greatest passion			1
at the moment there are four of my own dogs , three foster dogs – a mum and her puppies – plus a mini boa constrictor ( found in an air - conditioning vent ) co-habiting in my house			1
i have a big garden , so do n’t think i am a hoarder			0
i volunteer with a charity called @entity80 and we save animals from ‘ death row ’ in the @entity7 dog pounds , and strays off the street			1
they are placed in loving foster homes until we find them a perfect ‘ forever home ’			1
our pack leader is my friend @entity90 , who started @entity91 after @entity92 to help some of the abandoned dogs in @entity94			1
we also rescue dogs from as far away as @entity96			1
however , most of are from the @entity7 area			0
about 200 perfectly healthy dogs are euthanised in @entity100 every week			1
and , across the @entity101 , millions are put down each year			0
about 50 per cent of all the ‘ owner surrenders ’ or strays are pedigrees			1
the most common reasons given for dogs being dumped is moving to a house that does n’t allow pets or , after buying a cute puppy , ‘ it got bigger than we thought it would ’			1
if a stray dog comes in , by law it has to be held for 72 hours to give the owners a chance to be reunited			0
about 200 perfectly healthy dogs are euthanised in @entity100 every week however , there is a 90 per cent chance that these dogs will be put to sleep			1
when the pound does a cull because of overcrowding , the strays are the first to be killed			0
the dog pounds , which we visit about three times a week to rescue dogs from death row , are the saddest places i have ever been to			1
after four years , i still cry when i ’m there			0
the staff do their best but they are overwhelmed			0
the dogs are confined to small kennels / runs with about 25 other barking or crying animals , and they have to relieve themselves where they eat and sleep			1
they are depressed and sad , and cry constantly for the family that abandoned them			0
they do n’t get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under their kennel door and their waste sprayed out with a high - powered hose			1
if the dog is big , black or any of the ‘ bully ’ breeds ( pitbull , rottweiler , mastiff etc ) , it is pretty much dead when it walks through the door			1
the most heartbreaking part is when they are taken to be put down			0
the dogs get excited when they see the leash , thinking they are going for a walk , and trot off happily , wagging their tails			1
until , that is , they get to the room			0
one shelter manager says : ‘ every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door			1
‘ it must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there			1
it ’s strange , but it happens with every one of them			0
’ the dog is then restrained and held down by one or two veterinary technicians depending on their size and how freaked out they are			1
a euthanasia technician or a vet starts the process			0
they find a vein in a front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ‘ pink stuff ’			1
if the dog panics from being restrained and jerks , the needle can tear out of a leg			0
‘ i ’ve seen needles comes out and i ’ve been covered with the resulting blood , and been deafened by the yelps and screams , ’ says the manager			1
‘ they all do n’t just go to sleep			1
sometimes they spasm for a while , gasp for air and defecate			0
’ i know this is heartbreaking to any dog lover and i am sorry for being graphic			1
but on a happier note , there are about 100 animal rescue groups in the @entity7 area that go into these shelters , take as many animals as possible and then find them loving homes			1
we are very strict about who can adopt – there ’s a process everyone must go through to make sure we match the right dog with the right person			0
and we always do a ‘ home check ’ to make sure that it is a suitable environment			1
adopters have to sign a contract , which includes the guarantee that if they ever give up the dog , they return it to us and not to the pound			0
for me , there is no better feeling than saving a dog from the pound , rehabilitating it and then watching it go to its forever home			1
the dog pounds , which we visit about three times a week to rescue dogs from death row , are the saddest places i have ever been to my most recent case was an emaciated @entity248 , who had given birth to three litters before being dumped on the street by her owners			1
she ended up at a shelter and when i took her she had only three hours left to live			1
she had calluses from lying on a cement floor and had chewed the end of her tail off from the stress			0
i called her @entity261 because with a lot of love ( and food ) she blossomed like a rose in the sun. she now lives with a couple who adore her , and they send me photographs of @entity271 , who goes fishing and camping , and lies in the sun snoring			0
i have added to my own pack a deaf and blind - in - one - eye dog called @entity277 , who came from a situation that even made the headlines back in the @entity281 – 137 dogs were seized from an animal hoarder			1
it is not just @entity101 that has a stray dog problem			0
about 9,000 strays were ‘ put to sleep ’ in the @entity281 last year , according to the @entity289			1
the charity found that 111,986 stray and abandoned dogs were picked up by local authority teams across the @entity281 in the last year – that ’s more than 300 every day			1
happily , microchips have saved the lives of more than 8,000 dogs in the past year by reuniting them with their owners			1
if your dog is n’t microchipped , i would strongly recommend it			0
if your dog is n't microchipped , i would strongly recommend it the device is only the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the skin			0
my dogs even have a gps tracking device attached to their collars and if any of them escaped or were stolen i could track them with an app on my phone			1
@entity312 ? maybe , but it ’s better to be safe than sorry			0
the best thing you could do , of course , is to rescue a dog rather than buy one			0
anyone who has a rescue dog knows they are the best type			0
they always know you have saved them , and they will love you with every fibre of their being			0
my first dog was @entity330 , a lurcher i got from @entity331 ( which never kills dogs )			1
he was my heart and when he died i thought it was the end of the world			0
i miss him every day			0
if i had n’t rescued @entity330 , i would never have ended up in dog rescue			0
so every one i save partly owes their lives to the love of mine			0
as the @entity345 saying goes : ‘ @entity346 are meant to be broken			2
that is how they open			0
’ since @entity330 , i have fallen in love a hundred more times – and i ’ve had my heart broken a thousand more			2
i have cried into the fur of a lifeless body and witnessed the result of horrific cruelty			0
but the happiness by far outweighs the sadness			0
i am not some sanctimonious do - gooder who has no life outside of dog rescue			2
i do n’t think there is a special place for me in heaven because of what i do			0
i just feel blessed that i have found my little niche in life			0
it compels me and defines me , and makes me happy			0
some people think my passion for animals is sad and i must be crazy to love my dogs like people love their children			1
but just because i did n’t give birth to them , does n’t mean i should love them less			0
i do n’t really give a fig what those people think			0
people who love dogs are my kind of people			2
we are from the same tribe			0
if you do n’t like dogs , then the chances are that i wo n’t like you			2
i definitely would n’t date you			0
it ’s a deal - breaker			2
but then you would n’t want to date me either – and would be horrified with sharing the bed with three dogs .			2
