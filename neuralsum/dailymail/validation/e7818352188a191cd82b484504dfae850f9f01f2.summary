@entity1 playmaker @entity0 has called on his @entity3 team - mates to believe they have what it takes to produce their own miracle result in @entity7 on tuesday night			1
the @entity9 ' hopes of progress to the quarter - finals of @entity13 's elite club competition are all but over following a disappointing 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg at the @entity16 last month			1
no team has recovered from more than a single - goal deficit going into an away leg in the @entity21 era			1
@entity0 believes @entity3 can beat @entity22 by three goals to reach the @entity21 quarter finals no club have ever overturned such a deficit , but the @entity1 says his team should take heart from recent form @entity3 were in fine form to beat @entity31 on saturday , with @entity32 playing a part in all three goals @entity0 says the @entity9 can carry their momentum into the midweek tie and progress past @entity22 @entity22 beat nine - man @entity38 3 - 0 in @entity39 on friday night to extend their formidable defensive record with only seven goals conceded from the last 22 games			1
@entity44 's side did not let in a goal in three home ties during the @entity21 group stages , but despite all the odds being stacked against the @entity50 side @entity0 feels @entity3 are well worth a gamble			1
' when you believe in yourselves , a positive energy grows that you can achieve your aims			0
in football , things that may look unlikely can happen			0
i know that if we believe in ourselves and utilise our potential , we can still go through , ' @entity0 told @entity61			2
' we need to score three goals and @entity22 are a team that play defensively , but we have to take initiative and score the first goal as quickly as possible to boost our confidence			1
@entity0 and @entity32 cut a dejected figure while @entity3 were being beaten at home by @entity22 last month the @entity9 will need to overturn a two - goal deficit against a team who rarely concede but @entity0 is confident that they have enough going forward , and can win if they seize the early initiative ' it is going to be difficult to score three times because they have defended well in the tournament so far , but if you look at our past matches and the way we played against @entity83 ( in the @entity85 quarter - final ) last week , i think there 's a chance we can still progress			1
' when you look at the @entity83 game , we controlled it and deserved to win the game , that just shows that if we convert what the manager encourages us to do into the games , we can achieve a lot			0
' @entity0 added : ' we know the quality we have in our team - there are world - class players here			1
' look at our options in attack , where a variety of players can and do score goals			0
that 's a positive for us and we will make sure to give everything in @entity22 to advance to the next round			2
' @entity0 has returned from three months out with a knee injury looking a much - stronger player , covering plenty of ground			2
@entity0 was taken off early on saturday , along with @entity113 , to preserve them for midweek in @entity22 the @entity1 , who was out with injury for much of this season , has come back stronger and fitter than ever the 26 - year - old former @entity120 midfielder feels he is benefiting from his new training regime			1
' i wanted to be as fit as possible when i returned after my injury			0
i worked on the upper part of my body as well as paying attention to my nutrition , ' he said			0
' i underwent treatment to get myself fit as soon as possible and to prevent the injury from returning			0
i am on a good path now			0
' i worked really hard and i think it shows in training and in matches that i am fresher			0
' i am really happy to be back on the pitch and able to do what i most love			0
' tuesday night will see @entity139 return to the @entity140 for the first time since his successful spell in charge which saw them win the 1988 @entity147 league title and @entity148 in 1991 , as well as reaching the 1992 @entity150 final and semi-finals of the @entity21 .			2

@entity3 trail @entity22 3 - 1 after @entity21 last 16 first leg
the @entity9 need to score at least three times in @entity22 to progress
but @entity0 *insists* that his team 's good form means they should be confident
@entity3 *breezed* past @entity31 3 - 0 at home on saturday
