by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:19 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 02:44 est , 20 september 2012 two top officials at the @entity4 were ousted from their jobs today but attorney general @entity6 was ruled blameless by a damning report that uncovered a catalog or errors in judgement in the @entity12 gun - trafficking scandal			1
two senior officials left the department , one by resignation and one by retirement , upon release of the 471 - page internal report			1
its author , inspector general @entity19 , also referred 14 people for possible department disciplinary action for their roles in @entity12 and a separate , earlier probe known as @entity12 , undertaken during the @entity26 administration			1
escape : attorney general @entity6 was cleared of any wrongdoing in the @entity12 probe , but the report found that he should have been briefed on the investigation @entity32 : some 1,400 of the 2,000 guns lost in @entity12 are yet to be recovered the high risk operation saw guns being allowed to be purchased by @entity37 gangsters and @entity38 agents were supposed to track them to higher level drug cartel members and catch the bigger fish red - handed			1
but , it backfired and resulted in hundreds of weapons turning up at crime scenes in the @entity46 and @entity37			0
and in the worst failure @entity48 agent @entity12 , who was gunned down in december 2010 with two guns that agents had been trying to track			2
@entity12 's murder was the catalyst that began the internal probe into the gun operation after two of the 2,000 weapons thought to have been acquired by illicit buyers were found at the murder scene			1
about 1,400 of the total are yet to be recovered			0
no criminal charges were recommended in the report			0
victim : @entity46 @entity48 agent @entity12 was gunned down with one of the weapons used in @entity12 in december 2010 the documents did not criticise @entity6 , but said lower - level officials should have briefed him about the investigation much earlier			1
investigators found that @entity6 did n't know anything about @entity12 until late january / early february and found no evidence that that the attorney general was told about the much - disputed ' gun - walking ' tactic employed by the department 's @entity73			1
the inspector general found fault with the work of the senior @entity73 leadership , the @entity73 staff and @entity46 attorney 's office in @entity82 and senior officials of @entity4 's criminal division in @entity85			0
he also said that poor internal information - gathering and drafting at @entity4 and @entity73 caused the department to initially misinform @entity88 about @entity12			2
one of those criticized in the report , former @entity73 acting director @entity89 , who headed that office during the @entity12 investigation , retired upon release of the report			1
' @entity89 made too many assumptions about the case , ' the report stated			2
' @entity89 should have asked basic questions about the investigation , including how public safety was being protected			0
' another of those criticized , @entity4 career attorney @entity102 , resigned			0
@entity102 was a deputy assistant attorney general in @entity4 's criminal division in @entity85			1
' @entity102 was the most senior person in the department in april and may 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in @entity111 and @entity12 , ' the report said			2
@entity102 's lawyer , @entity112 , called the report 's criticism ' profoundly wrong ' and ' deeply flawed			0
' resigned : deputy assistant attorney general @entity102 , the top @entity4 official with the power to stop @entity12 @entity118 : weapons tied to the gun trafficking operation known @entity12 were discovered in april in the home of @entity122 , in the volatile city of @entity124 , @entity37 in @entity12 and at least three earlier probes during the administration of @entity26 , agents in @entity126 employed a risky tactic called gun - walking - allowing low - level ' straw ' buyers - believed to be working for notorious @entity37 drug cartels - to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops			1
but because of thin @entity73 staffing and weak penalties , the traditional strategy of arresting suspected straw buyers as soon as possible had failed to stop the flow of tens of thousands of guns to @entity37 - more than 68,000 in the past five years			0
the goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low - level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others			0
the report also said that poor internal information - gathering and drafting at the @entity4 and @entity73 caused the department to initially misinform @entity88 about @entity12			2
out : @entity89 , the acting director of the @entity73 ' retired upon the release of the report , which heavily criticised him for assuming too much rep @entity160 , chairman of the @entity162 , and vocal critic of the operation , said : ' the inspector general 's report confirms findings by @entity88 ' investigation of a near total disregard for public safety in @entity12			1
' the report 's conclusion reads : ' our review of @entity12 and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies , tactics , errors in judgment , and management failures that permeated @entity182 and the @entity183 , as well as the @entity184 for the @entity185			2
' one of the five suspects in @entity12 's murder was arrested two weeks ago			0
@entity188 , who was arrested on september 6 in @entity190 state			0
another suspect is currently on trial , while three more - @entity193 , 31 , @entity194 , 34 , @entity195 , 34 - remain at large .			0

471 - page report cleared attorney general @entity6 of any wrongdoing , but said he should have been briefed about the probe
acting *atf* director @entity89 quits as report is released
@entity12 was a failed gun - trafficking probe
