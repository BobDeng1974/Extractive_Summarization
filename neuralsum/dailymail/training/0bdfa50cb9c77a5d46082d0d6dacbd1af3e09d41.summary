by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 14:00 est , 5 march 2014 a devastated mother has described the moment she smothered her son who was suffering from a terminal genetic disease			1
@entity7 's son @entity6 had @entity9 's disease - a condition which had also killed his father @entity11			1
while his brother @entity12 also suffered with the condition , @entity6 had never come to terms with his diagnosis , @entity7 said			1
@entity7 's son @entity6 had advanced @entity9 's disease			1
she helped him take his own life by smothering him after he took a heroin overdose speaking on @entity19 's @entity18 , she explained how on his 42nd birthday , @entity6 had tried to take his life with a massive heroin overdose			1
lying next to him and seeing him struggling to breathe as the drug took hold , she took a pillow and suffocated him to relieve his suffering			1
she told hosts @entity27 and @entity29 : ' i thought " this has to end "			1
i could n't take it any longer			2
i put a pillow over his face			2
when i took it away , he was gone			0
' although she was arrested and charged , an autopsy concluded her actions would not have changed @entity6 's fate			1
she was initially charged with murder , but eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting @entity44 judge later ruled during her hearing in october 2000 that the case was an ' exceptional circumstance ' and she was given a conditional discharge			1
@entity6 had never come to terms with his diagnosis , his mother said			1
on his 47th birthday he tried to take his own life @entity7 has campaigned for a change in the law ever since @entity6 's death in march 2000			1
her story features in an emotive new book : assisted dying : who makes @entity61 ? , published tomorrow			2
@entity9 's disease is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene			1
this gene produces a protein called @entity65			0
it 's not known how , but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain , causing a range of symptoms			2
sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings , clumsiness , lack of motivation , aggression and depression which , in the early stages , can often be written off as simple personality traits			0
later , they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics , then weight loss and muscle weakness which leaves the patient unable to swallow , speak or move			0
every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration , but it is a fatal condition			2
@entity7 , who had five children , says she knew to be aware of the disease because her husband @entity11 had also suffered from it			1
the couple had married in 1955 and had five ­ children – @entity6 , @entity12 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 – and raised them in @entity102 , @entity103			1
then in his thirties , @entity11 became absent minded , would leave taps on and cigarettes lit in strange places , recalls @entity7			1
' it turned out his father had also had @entity9 's , but his mother had never told him			1
we were told he had died of a nervous breakdown			0
' @entity11 died at the age of 44 of a heart attack - and @entity7 began to worry if the devastating disease would present itself in any of her children			1
a judge later ruled during @entity7 's hearing that the case was an exceptional circumstance and she was given a conditional discharge ' i told them not to have children in case they passed it on and to make the best of their lives			1
' her son @entity12 was diagnosed in his 30s and was accepting of the condition , she says			1
' he was never very independently minded and we found him a place in one of the best care homes in the country for @entity9 's - he really settled there			1
' @entity12 later died , aged 48 , having been confined to a wheelchair			2
but for his brother @entity6 , things were very different - and @entity7 says she clearly remembers the day she realised he too had the disease			1
