i thought it was a nice smell - but obviously the cat did n't agree ' ' this was totally out of character , he normally runs off when he does n’t like something			0

the cat , which has a phobia of strong smells , attacked mr @entity9 supposedly because he was wearing the @entity12 scent , pictured above he said : ' it ’s possible the cat may have attacked as a result of the perfume			1
' cats identify people by their smells and he may have seen the scent as a threat			2
' this has happened in the past with both dogs and cats though dogs are more visual than cats , they do n’t rely on their sense of smell as much			0
