by @entity0 published : 03:20 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 27 june 2012 @entity2 should ' be ready to become independent ' in the wake of a slew of political attacks and crackdowns on its tax schemes , a senior politician said today			1
sir @entity8 , the island 's assistant chief minister , wants officials to begin preparations for severing its links with the @entity14 because the largest of the @entity16 is getting a ' raw deal '			1
prime minister @entity18 last week branded comedian @entity19 ' morally wrong ' for pumping millions into @entity2 - based company @entity20 to avoid paying tax			1
row : sir @entity8 , pictured with the @entity23 , wants officials to begin preparations for severing links with the @entity14 the people of @entity27 are already set to vote on independence from the @entity14 in 2014			1
@entity2 is suffering increasingly strained relations with @entity31 and its government claims over the last five years @entity29 have made it ' very plain ' they want to damage its economy			2
for decades its relaxed laws drew in the rich and big business because of its tax set - up , but since the financial crisis successive @entity14 governments have fought to clampdown on banks and tax avoidance , hitting @entity2 badly			1
this was further compounded when @entity2 and @entity44 lost their @entity46 bid in march to stop the @entity47 scrapping a tax loophole that allowed the @entity16 to sell dvds and @entity50 - free			2
battle : the picturesque islands have become a tax haven for the rich and big business but the @entity14 government is fighting that ' i feel that we get a raw deal			1
i feel it 's not fair			0
i think that the duty of @entity2 politicians now is to try to explain what the island is doing and not to take things lying down , ' sir @entity8 said in an interview with the @entity67			1
' the island should be prepared to stand up for itself and should be ready to become independent if it were necessary in @entity2 's interest to do so			1
' i hope that the constitutional relationship with the @entity14 will continue			0
but if it becomes plain that our interests in fact lie in being independent it does n't seem to me that we should bury our head in the sand and say we 're not going to do that			0
' scandal : @entity19 invested in a @entity2 - based tax scheme and islanders fear this could make the situation even worse despite being largely self - governing and not officially part of the @entity14 or the @entity87 , it is not independent from @entity14			1
and the @entity88 has tried to clamp down hard on its tax affairs to drag more revenue into the @entity47			0
in his last budget chancellor @entity91 told @entity29 : ' i regard tax evasion – and , indeed , aggressive tax avoidance – as morally repugnant , ' and said he would close loopholes related to offshore pensions and vat - free websites - hitting @entity2 hard			1
civil servants have been asked build new anti-avoidance laws , many of which would also hurt the island 's economy			2
@entity8 has said that @entity2 would have to deal with the moral outrage in @entity14 over tax avoidance but would also have to get a fair deal			1
another senior politician said that the island was in huge danger of being unfairly hit because @entity19 's investment in @entity2 has become so high profile			1
' the @entity14 tax code is horrifically complicated			2
it has all sorts of exemptions and allowances and schemes – and that 's fertile ground for tax avoiders , ' he told the @entity67			0
and in the face of this vitriol @entity2 has opened offices in @entity125 and @entity126 for the first time as well as hiring pr specialists @entity129 to improve their image			0
@entity8 , who is also in charge of @entity2 's international relations , added : ' we want to educate			1
we want to explain what the island is doing			0
' we understand that the movement is towards collecting as much tax as the @entity14 legitimately can do and it 's not part of our function to help @entity14 citizens to avoid paying their dues in the @entity14			2
' @entity2 has an interesting and sometimes violent history , changing hands several times in the past 1,000 years or so			0
it was conquered by the @entity146 in the ninth century and eventually claimed by the @entity147 in 933			0
when @entity149 took @entity150 from @entity151 at @entity152 the islands first became linked to @entity14			0
two centuries later @entity153 lost all his territories in mainland @entity155 , and the islands , in 1204			0
but @entity2 and the @entity16 decided to become crown dependencies and have been loyal to the @entity150 monarchy ever since , despite several skirmishes and invasions			0
in 1781 , at the height of tensions between @entity162 and @entity14 , a @entity162 invasion force of 2,000 tried to take over the island but failed			2
during @entity165 , @entity2 was occupied by @entity166 for nearly five years between july 1 1940 until may 9 1945			0
@entity168 slaves were brought there to fortify it and it was one of the last parts of @entity171 to be freed from @entity173 tyranny .			0

' we are getting a raw deal , ' says sir @entity8 , the island 's assistant chief minister
@entity2 is not governed by the @entity14 but is not independent either
@entity14 's government has been trying to close several tax loopholes used on the island
@entity19 *controversially* pumped millions into the @entity2 - based @entity20 ' avoidance ' scheme
