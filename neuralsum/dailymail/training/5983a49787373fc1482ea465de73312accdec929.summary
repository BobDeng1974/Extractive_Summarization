by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 15:27 est , 28 march 2013 they say we all eventually turn in to our parents but there are some things we 'd rather not inherit			0
prince @entity7 , it seems , has begun to lose some hair around his crown , just like his big brother @entity10 and their father @entity11			2
the 28 - year - old royal 's hair shows signs of thinning in pictures taken on a recent charity trip			1
rapidly thinning : prince @entity7 's hair was noticeably thinner as he played with children on a visit in february to @entity21 in southern @entity22 on behalf of his charity , @entity24 pictured during a visit to the @entity26 for the deaf on behalf of his charity , @entity24 , in @entity21 , last month @entity7 was showing some scalp through his famous ginger locks - indicating the beginnings of male pattern baldness , according to @entity34 's leading hair loss expert @entity35			1
prince @entity10 started losing his hair in his early 20s and was noticeably bald by the time he was 25			1
the process appears to have started a little later for his younger brother @entity7 , who nevertheless looks to have inherited his family 's baldness gene			2
hair transplant surgeon @entity42 - hair loss expert on the @entity44 show embarrassing bodies - said the pictures showed clear signs of hair loss			2
and that @entity7 is thinning around the crown area			0
disappearing : the 28 - year - old royal 's hair loss was more pronounced than ever in @entity21 last month ' around a quarter of men start going bald before the age of 30 , so this is hardly a big surprise especially when it runs in the family as it does for the @entity57			1
' if @entity7 's hair loss progresses in the normal way , i would expect him to have a significant bald patch around his crown by the time he is 40			1
it will be worse if it also spreads to his hairline as it has with his brother			0
' hair loss can have a devastating impact on a young men like @entity7			1
iit can shatter their confidence and lead to significant loss of self esteem			0
' dr @entity35 said that a strong family gene is the most significant factor in the onset of hair loss			1
like father , like son : prince @entity7 at the @entity79 last year with prince @entity11 , left , who is also suffering from thinning hair			2
' there is a strong family gene on both sides of @entity7 's family , ' hair specialist dr @entity35 said hair envy : prince @entity7 admiring a full head of hair as he met a child in @entity21 prince @entity7 's father , prince @entity11 , his grandfather @entity90 and both his uncles , @entity90 and @entity92 , have significant hair loss			1
and the gene is prominent on his mother 's side , too : princess @entity98 's father @entity97 was bald			0
dr @entity35 said : ' there is a strong family gene on both sides of @entity7 's family			1
he is lucky that it has kicked in a bit later than his brother @entity10 - but the signs are not good for @entity7			1
' but he said there were simple measures @entity7 could take to combat his hair loss			1
' i would strongly urge him to act now , ' said dr @entity35			2
going , going , gone : prince @entity10 started losing his hair in his early 20s and was noticeably bald by the time he was 25 family problem : prince @entity7 's hair was showing clear signs of a growing bald patch at prince @entity10 's wedding in 2011 ' the best remedy at this stage is for @entity7 to start taking propecia which wo n't replace the hair which he has already lost but will help to stop him losing any more			1
if @entity10 had started using the drug at the same age he could have significantly slowed down his hair loss			1
' the other solution would be for @entity7 to use @entity124 , the only other clinically proven hair loss medication available			2
' you can buy a mousse which you apply to the thinning areas of the scalp			0
' but the only long - term solution is a hair transplant - where hair is moved from the back or sides of the scalp to bald areas such as the crown			0
' dr @entity35 said the stigma around seeking treatment for hair loss had largely gone , thanks to high profile hair transplant patients like @entity143 and @entity144			1
expert : dr @entity35 runs the @entity147 hair loss clinic in @entity148 he said : ' @entity143 was brave to go public about his hair transplant and show that he was not embarrassed to seek help for his hair loss			1
' the stigma around seeking treatment has been removed			0
it would send out a great signal to other men if a royal would also seek treatment			0
' their options in covering up their baldness are limited			0
it would be difficult for @entity10 , for instance , to shave his head , which is what a lot of men do to hide their baldness			0
a royal with a crew cut just does n’t seem right somehow			0
' prince @entity7 - recently voted the @entity168 in a magazine poll - once joked that prince @entity10 was ' already bald aged 12			2
' @entity7 also made fun of prince @entity10 's baldness when commenting about artist @entity173 ’ portrait of the princes three years ago			0
he said said : ' i 'm a little bit more ginger in there than i am in real life , i think , ' he said , ' and @entity10 has been given more hair			0
' on prince @entity7 's charity trip to @entity21 , @entity22 , in february he met children at a charity on the trip who were urged to teach the young royal the sign language for ' ginger			1
