a new mum who once tipped the scales at 18 stone is feeling in a league of her own after losing eight stone to become a world championship bodybuilder			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , ballooned to a size 18 when she was pregnant with her son @entity10 and once he was born , decided to join a gym to lose the weight			1
when a gym instructor told @entity6 , 36 , that she looked very symmetrical and should consider bodybuilding , she tried pumping iron as a way to shift the baby - weight and found she was a natural at it			1
mother 's love : four - year - old @entity10 is @entity6 's biggest fan and enjoys watching her compete flashback : @entity22 before she lost the weight ( left ) and displaying her winning ways in just 18 months , the new mother lost five stone in fat and built up her impressive muscles with gruelling weight and cardio sessions			1
although she came last in the first weight - lifting competition she entered , @entity6 did n't give up and after a few more disappointments she started winning			2
she qualified her for the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) @entity37 championships last year which she won and has now gone on to win the @entity36			2
now @entity6 weighs 10st 9lb and her body fat is down to just nine per cent			0
and her son @entity10 , now aged four , has become her biggest fan and loves going to ' mummy 's muscle shows '			1
@entity6 shows off her bodybuilding prowess competing in the @entity43 in @entity44 @entity6 piled on the pounds during pregnancy but began losing teh weight once she joined the gym			1
@entity6 spends three hours a day training in the gym and is aiming to compete in the @entity50 competition in @entity51 this summer			1
the mother - of - one said : ' i ate for three the whole time i was pregnant and i put on a lot of weight			2
' i really struggled to lose the weight afterwards for about three years and i was really unhappy			0
' through exercise and diet i 'd managed to lose a bit of weight			0
i was doing a gym class and i was the only one who turned up			2
' my gym instructor must have been watching me more closely because it was just me and she said i was really symmetrical and had i ever tried bodybuilding			1
' weigh to go : @entity10 tries lifting the weights for himself while mum @entity6 trains @entity10 loves nothing more than seeing his mother in action @entity6 , who is a tattoo artist , said her husband , @entity73 , used to be a bodybuilder and encouraged her to give it a go			1
she said : ' we went along to a show and i decided i wanted to do it			0
' in my first competition i came last out of five people in my category and i was absolutely mortified			0
' i 'd put in so much work and i was just gutted but i signed up for another competition two weeks later and came fourth out of five			0
@entity6 's husband @entity73 takes a closer look at his wife 's bodybuilding trophy in safe hands : using to lifting heavy weights , @entity10 is as light as a feather by comparison ' doing that first competition i never imagined i would now be world champion			1
' i like the way i look on stage			0
you have to learn how to pose properly so it shows your physique off to its best			2
' even when i 'm not at competitions i still get a lot of positive comments about the way i look			0
' i 'm not as lean as i am during competitions , but i still have quite a bit of muscle definition			0
' at the beach it 's usually guys that comment , saying things like " check out how big her muscles are " , i think they 're probably jealous ! ' i do n't take anything to heart because everyone has different ideas of what 's attractive			0
