after losing his wife to cancer on christmas day , scientist @entity0 vowed to do all he could to help others who could be saved by an early diagnosis			1
and now , less than two months later , a cancer detector that mr @entity0 has invented will be trialled on the @entity6 – potentially saving up to 10,000 lives			1
his breathalyser – which sniffs out chemicals associated with a number of cancers , including lung and bowel – will be used in two hospitals this summer as part of a £ 1million clinical trial			1
mr @entity0 said the loss of his ‘ inspirational ’ wife and the mother to his five - year - old twin boys had spurred him on to helping others be diagnosed and treated early			1
‘ because of the experience of my wife and my family , we saw the devastation that cancer brings to families , ’ he told @entity40			2

tragic : @entity18 died on christmas day last year , aged 36 , after a two - year battle with colon cancer ‘ when my wife was sick , we talked about what motivated her , what motivates me			1

it puts an extra spring in my step			0
’ the @entity74 ( lung cancer indicator detection ) project he has helped develop analyses the chemicals present in a person ’s breath			1
diseases such as lung cancer produce minuscule but unique chemical traces			2
this can indicate illness long before symptoms become obvious , boosting the chances of survival			0
the survival rate for stage 1 lung cancer is 75 per cent – for @entity94 it is just 5 per cent			2
mr @entity0 said his goal is to save 10,000 lives			1
dr @entity97 , a consultant respiratory physician at @entity98 , @entity99 , told @entity40 : ‘ if successful , this test could be delivered locally – for example at @entity103 surgeries and pharmacies for people assessed at being high risk			0
' we are looking forward to answering this question with this innovative study			0
’ miss @entity18 wrote a poignant blog about her illness , which has since been made into a book entitled @entity113 : @entity114 )			1
