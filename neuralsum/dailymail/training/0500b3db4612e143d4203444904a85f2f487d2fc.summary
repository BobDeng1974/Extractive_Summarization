a @entity1 media analyst was convicted today of defamation for accusing a state television network of staging a video that depicted a @entity6 boy being killed in a firefight between @entity6 militants and @entity10 forces			1

it then cut to the motionless boy slumped in his father 's lap. the report blamed @entity10 forces for the death			1
in a report issued in 2004 , @entity27 said the footage was orchestrated and there was no proof that the boy had been killed			1
@entity1 - 2 sued for defamation , and after a long legal battle , a @entity37 court fined @entity27 Â£ 6,000 today			1
he called the verdict ' outrageous '			0
the @entity18 case has long stirred emotions in @entity10 , tapping into a larger sense of the jewish state being victimised in the media			1
over the past decade @entity27 has amassed hours of video about the day of the shooting			1
at the heart of his claim is the fact that , according to the reporting by @entity1 - 2 , father and son were hit by a total of 15 bullets but in the video , neither appears to be bleeding			1
he says the firefight is real , but the shooting of the man and boy was staged for the camera			0
' i am serene because i know the truth will come out , ' @entity27 said			2
' despite 15 bullets not one drop of blood was on their clothes , their bodies , the wall they were leaning against			0
' remembering : @entity90 , sister of @entity18 poses with a picture of her sibling in @entity94 in the @entity45 last month , the @entity10 government issued a new report on the incident that said the report was misleading , provides no evidence and was part of a smear campaign against the jewish state			2
@entity103 , a lawyer for @entity1 - 2 , said the verdict would allow journalists to retain confidence in their work			2
@entity1 - 2 @entity109 correspondent @entity108 said he and @entity1 - 2 parent company @entity110 welcomed wednesday 's decision			2
' today 's result is a relief , ' he said , but added it did not put the matter to rest			0
@entity108 , a @entity1 - @entity10 national , said conspiracy theorists continue to hound them over the incident			1
he said despite years of litigation and @entity10 officials accusing him of fabrication , he welcomed an investigation			2
' we are ready whenever @entity10 wants to go for a professional investigation following international standards , ' he told @entity127			2
@entity45 's militant @entity129 rulers said the ruling confirmed that @entity10 and their supporters lied about the military 's practices in the coastal territory			2
' they deceive and cover their crimes in front of the media and the world , ' said spokesman @entity139			0
@entity10 foreign ministry spokesman @entity140 said he had no comment on a case that delved into the intricacy of @entity1 defamation law			1
he said , however , that the @entity10 position on the @entity18 case remains unchanged			0
' it is improbable , not to say impossible , that the bullets which hit @entity151 and @entity18 came from the @entity10 position , ' he said			0
' where they did come from remains subject to many hypotheses , though none can be proven			0
' the second @entity6 intifada or uprising broke out at the end of september 2000 and is named after the @entity109 mosque complex where the violence began			0
frustrations that years of the negotiation had failed to deliver a @entity6 state were intensified by the collapse of the @entity167 summit in july 2000			0
@entity168 , then the leader of @entity10 's opposition , paid a visit to the site in @entity109 known to @entity172 as @entity173 , and to @entity174 as @entity173 , which houses the @entity175 - and frustration boiled over into violence			0
in one of the enduring images of the conflict 12 - year - old @entity18 is killed during a gunbattle between @entity10 troops and @entity6 in the @entity45 , kindling @entity6 anger about the growing number of children killed by @entity10 forces			1
the army initially apologises , but later casts doubt on whether its forces killed the boy			0
the @entity192 agreement , brokered by president @entity193 , aims to end the upsurge in violence			0
it breaks down almost immediately .			0

@entity198 claimed the footage , shown on @entity1 tv , was faked
it shows boy *cowering* in a *gunfight* between @entity10 and @entity6 militants
the footage , which also showed his body , galvanised anti-israeli sentiment
now *mr* @entity27 has been convicted of defaming the @entity1 channel
