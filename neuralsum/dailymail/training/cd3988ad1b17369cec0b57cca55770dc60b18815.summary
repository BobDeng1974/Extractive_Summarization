there are said to be around 6,500 spoken languages around the world			2
while 2,000 of these languages are spoken by fewer than 1,000 speakers , others are much more common with words and phrases being passed down through generations and shared across countries and continents			1
a map has been designed to highlight the spread of these common languages by plotting words , and their translations , from population to population			1
type a word in the interactive map below called @entity20 , the interactive guide ( pictured ) was created by @entity21 in @entity22			1
to use the map , type any word in any language into the search box and press @entity27			1
as the words are mapped globally , the map reads each translation out loud			1
coloured lines also connect countries with a common language called @entity20 , the interactive guide was created by @entity21 in @entity22			1

to use the map , type any word in any language into the search box and press @entity27			1
as the words are plotted globally , the map reads each translation out loud			1
coloured lines also connect all the countries with a common language and where the word has the same translation			1
clicking on a word reveals more about that particular country ’s language , and how many countries share the translation , with details taken from @entity55			1

clicking on a word reveals more about that particular country ’s language , and how many countries share the translation , with details taken from @entity55			1
in many instances , it shows how @entity70 formed the basis for modern - day languages , particularly in @entity73			1
typing the @entity75 word ‘ cat ’ reveals how many @entity78 speakers there are across the central band of countries in @entity82 , including @entity83 and @entity84			1
in both @entity86 and @entity87 , the translation is ‘ gato ’ , and the coloured lines highlight how @entity86 dominates @entity89 , with the exception of @entity22			1
and how @entity87 is isolated in southern @entity82 in @entity91			0
in terms of the number of speakers and dominance , @entity86 is the most prominent language in @entity97			2
@entity87 is universal in @entity98 , but there are dialects in the south and central regions , including the dialect of @entity104			0
the etymology of the word cat is said to come from a @entity107 , and was introduced in around the first century @entity108 across @entity73 , ' cat ' , or ' catt ' , comes from the @entity70 ' cattus ' and @entity112 @entity111 ' κάττα '			2
from here , it was introduced to many @entity116 languages			2
there is a noticeable difference in how the majority of @entity121 countries write their translated version of ' cat ' , where the ‘ c ’ is replaced by a ‘ k ’ , and how the word varies more across this region			1
typing the @entity75 word ‘ cat ’ reveals how many @entity78 speakers there are across the central band of countries in @entity82 , including @entity83 and @entity84			1
in both @entity86 and @entity87 , the translation is ‘ gato ’ , and this highlights how @entity86 dominates @entity89 , with the exception of @entity22			1
it also shows how @entity87 is isolated in southern @entity82 in @entity91 the translations of the word ‘ love ’ are more varied			2
in @entity78 , @entity86 and @entity141 , for example , it is shown as ‘ aimer ’ , ‘ amar ’ and ‘ amare ’			0
it differs in @entity146 , however , where it becomes ‘ estimar			0
’ in @entity148 , love translates as ‘ liefde ’ , and @entity150 ’s say ‘ lieben			0
’ but further north it becomes ‘ elsker ’ and ‘ alskar ’			0
meanwhile , in @entity156 as well as @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , the word translates as ‘ любовь ’ for example , from the @entity162 to the east , into @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 the word evolves from ‘ cat ’ to ‘ kat ’ to ‘ katze ’ to ‘ @entity171 ’ to ‘ kedi ’ respectively			0
the map also shows the range of scripts in the @entity175 and into @entity176 from @entity177 to @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180 ’s @entity180 and @entity181			2
‘ taxi ’ is ‘ taxi ’ in many languages ( @entity86 highlighted			0
) it is shortened from ‘ taximeter ’ , a tool used to measure distances and fares , and ' cabriolet ' that refers to a horse - drawn carriage			0
@entity191 comes from @entity70 for ‘ taxa ’ , meaning ‘ tax ’ the @entity20 plots the official languages in each country , and does n’t necessarily reflect the dominance of other languages in that region			1
for instance , @entity199 has the most native speakers around the world , but is only the official language of @entity204 and @entity205 , as well as one of four official languages of @entity208			1
@entity209 is listed as having no official language , although @entity75 is considered the as the national language of the country			2
translations of the word ‘ love ’ are more varied			0
from the @entity75 ‘ lufu ’ , the word has a @entity218 origin , and from an @entity116 root it is shared with @entity220 ‘ lubhyati ’ for ‘ desires ’ , @entity70 ’s ‘ libet ’ , which translates into ‘ it is pleasing ’ , as well as libido			0
while the @entity70 verb for ‘ to love ’ is ' amare '			0
these differences are seen in the way the word changes as the map moves around the world			2
in @entity78 , @entity86 and @entity141 , for example , it is shown as ‘ aimer ’ , ‘ amar ’ and ‘ amare ’			0
it differs in @entity146 , however , where it becomes ‘ estimar			0
’ in @entity148 , love translates as ‘ liefde ’ , and @entity150 ’s say ‘ lieben			0
’ but further north it becomes ‘ elsker ’ and ‘ alskar ’			0
meanwhile , in @entity156 as well as @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , the word translates as ‘ любовь ’ of all the languages of @entity156 , @entity246 is the only official language			1
but , there are 35 different languages which are considered official languages in various regions of @entity156 , along with @entity246			1
according to the map , @entity253 is the official language of 21 countries , including @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			1
it belongs to the @entity261 branch of the @entity263 family , and in this language and script the word science is translated into علم			2
the @entity75 word ' science ' originated in @entity269 and has links with @entity78 and @entity271 , from scire which means ‘ know ’			0
the noun ' ciencia ' in @entity86 translates to science , as well as erudition and knowledge			0
the @entity75 word ' science ' originated in @entity269 and has links with @entity78 and @entity271 , from scire which means ‘ know ’			0
the noun cicencia in @entity86 translates to science , as well as erudition and knowledge			0
in @entity150 , the word translates to ‘ wissenschaft ’ , where ‘ wissen ’ means knowledge and ‘ schaft ’ is a suffix used to denote that the word is feminine			0
in @entity291 , science is ‘ tiede ’ the map also reveals that despite its vast size , the official language of the @entity295 , as well as @entity296 , is @entity75 , or @entity298			1
it is n't until @entity300 ( shown ) that the word for ' science ' , used as an example , changes into @entity86 and ' ciencia ' in @entity150 , the word translates to ‘ wissenschaft ’ , where ‘ wissen ’ means knowledge and ‘ schaft ’ is a suffix used to denote that the word is feminine			0
in @entity291 , science is ‘ tiede ’			0
on the map , @entity209 is listed as having no official language ( pictured ) , although @entity75 is considered the as the national language of the country the two ‘ national ’ languages of @entity291 are @entity291 and @entity318			1
the official minority languages are three @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and the @entity324 language			2
elsewhere , the word ‘ internet ’ is a portmanteau of the @entity75 words ‘ inter ’ , for reciprocal or mutual , and ‘ net ’ for network			2
the technology was described in a paper in 1974 , but the term is widely accepted as being coined in 1986 by the @entity335			0
considered a proper noun by many , the word is often capitalised , but the term has become so widespread - and is often used interchangeably with the word web - that many people use it as a noun instead			2
as a result , the word has n’t been translated globally , and as the map shows , is written as ‘ internet ’ in the various scripts			1
there are differences between the internet , and the web , namely that the internet is the network that connects computers and devices , while the web is used to move content around this network			0
however , the two terms are widely used to mean the same thing nowadays			0
similarly , the @entity75 word ‘ taxi ’ is ‘ taxi ’ in many countries			2
this is because it shortened from ‘ taximeter ’ and ‘ cabriolet ’			0
the taximeter was invented in 1891 to measure distances and fares , while cabriolet refers to a horse - drawn carriage			0
@entity191 itself comes from @entity70 for ‘ taxa ’ , meaning ‘ tax ’			0
the word ‘ internet ’ is a portmanteau of @entity75 words ‘ inter ’ , for reciprocal or mutual , and ‘ net ’ for network			2
considered a proper noun by many , the word is often capitalised , but the term has become so widespread - and is often used interchangeably with the word web - that many people use it as a noun instead			2

the map was created by @entity22 - based @entity393 and shows the official languages of countries
type a word in any language into @entity20 to hear it being translated globally in these official languages
as the words are mapped globally , lines connect all the countries with a common language
these lines in turn reveal how language has spread with *migration* and *colonisation*
clicking a word reveals more about that particular language , and how many countries share the translation
