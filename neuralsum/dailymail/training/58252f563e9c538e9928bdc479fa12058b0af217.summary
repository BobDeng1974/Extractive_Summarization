young people who keep their hearts healthy may be less likely to suffer @entity2 's in later life , say researchers			1
they found those with healthier levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later			2
people with small signs of deteriorating heart health when young were less likely to score well in cognitive tests in middle - age			1
an elderly woman suffering from alzheimer 's disease , in a residential home specialising in the care of people with dementia ( file picture ) study author dr @entity26 , a neuropsychiatrist , epidemiologist and professor at the @entity29 , said : ' it 's amazing that as a young adult , mildly elevated cardiovascular risks seem to matter for your brain health later in life			1
' we 're not talking about old age issues , but lifelong issues			0
' there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the @entity42 - a figure expected to rise to a million by 2021			1
the report is one of the first comprehensive long - term studies looking at the effect of key risk factors for heart disease and stroke on brain function			1
altogether 3,330 18 to 30 - year - olds had their blood pressure , fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels checked every two to five years			1
researchers analysed each person 's cumulative cardiovascular health over 25 years			2
at the end of the study , published in the journal @entity63 , the participants took three tests measuring memory , thinking speed and mental flexibility			2
researchers found those with healthier levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later those with blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol levels slightly higher than recommended guidelines when they were young , had lower scores in cognitive function tests in their 40s and 50s			0
the average differences found , although small , were considered statistically significant by the researchers			0
elevated blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol are three major risk factors for atherosclerosis , the slow narrowing of arteries caused by a build - up of plaque in the artery walls leading to the brain and heart			0
dr @entity26 said the narrowing of the arteries leading to and in the brain was the most likely explanation for the link between cardiovascular health and cognitive function			0
she said : ' our study is hopeful , because it tells us we could maybe make a dent in the risks of @entity2 's and other forms of dementia by emphasising the importance of controlling risk factors among younger people			1
' previous research suggests that eating a @entity114 diet can help prevent memory loss and may stave off @entity2			2
the diet rich in plant foods and fish , and low intake of red meat , appears to improve vascular function , the flexibility of cells lining the walls of blood vessels , which help keep arteries supplying heart and brain healthy			0
dr @entity129 , head of research at @entity130 , said : ' there is mounting evidence to suggest that keeping healthy when we are younger may help preserve memory and thinking skills in later life			0
' previous research has shown that high blood pressure , high blood sugar and raised cholesterol may all be linked to an increased risk of dementia			0
' while there 's currently no certain way to prevent dementia , evidence suggests that eating a healthy diet , doing regular exercise , not smoking , not drinking too much and keeping blood pressure in check could help reduce the risk of the condition			2
' research to build a more detailed picture of the risk factors for dementia is vital , as the better we understand these factors , the more able we will be to take action to lower our risk			0
' if we could delay the onset of @entity2 's , the most common cause of dementia , by five years , we could halve the number of people living with the disease - that means investment in research is crucial			1

study is one of the first long - term studies into @entity2 's
it checked 3,330 18 to 30 - year - olds every two to five years
there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the @entity42
