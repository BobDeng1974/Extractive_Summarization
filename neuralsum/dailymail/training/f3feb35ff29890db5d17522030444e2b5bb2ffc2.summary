this year is shaping up to be a landmark 12 months for @entity2 sporting success			2
after an up and down 2014 , which saw various highs and lows , 2015 is promising to be a time where those wrongs can be righted and legacies can be cemented			2
below @entity10 's experts pick who they believe could make this year their own			1
@entity13 - @entity12 ( by @entity14 ) the @entity16 record is a given			1
he is on 46 international goals and this year will surpass sir @entity21 ’s mark of 49			2
but he needs only 24 goals to surpass sir @entity21 ’s @entity24 record of 249 too - that should be expected , injury permitting , in 2015			1
all of which means that this year we will again spend time considering @entity12 ’s impact			1
a summary thus far might read : not quite as good as we had hoped for in 2004 but better than almost anyone else			0
his longevity knocks spots off @entity36 ; his goal - scoring will be better than @entity38 and @entity39			2
you have to go back to 1966 to put @entity12 in his place			1
those who feared he would burn out were wrong			0
@entity12 is the best we have - and we should be thankful			1
@entity12 is on course to beat sir @entity47 's @entity24 and @entity16 goalscoring records one to watch : @entity48 until last week , @entity48 , 19 , was the best technical midfielder in @entity49 having been nurtured by @entity50 at @entity51			1
@entity52 have now taken him to the @entity53			0
he ’s already played for @entity16 ’s under - 20s - and not many do that from @entity49			1
@entity48 ( right ) left @entity51 for @entity52 in a £ 1.75million deal on a four - and - a - half year contract @entity59 - @entity58 ( by @entity60 ) with the @entity61 and the @entity62 , this year should be a big one for the new crop of @entity16 players who emerged in 2014 , but the most important man this year and for some time to come is @entity58			1
now the @entity66 is back in the middle order , he should continue to make big runs in all forms			0
@entity58 is also highly regarded as a leader and favourite to succeed @entity72 as @entity74 captain and would have become @entity76 skipper after the @entity61 had @entity72 managed a decent score in @entity78 and stayed on			1
as it was , it was felt that throwing in an inexperienced captain would have been reckless and @entity82 got the nod			0
@entity58 ’s time will come			2
@entity16 batsman @entity58 is expected to succeed @entity72 as a future @entity74 captain one to watch : @entity86 this should be the year when @entity88 , 23 , gets his chance in limited - overs cricket with @entity16			1
he is the sort of dynamic player they will need where his explosive batting and keeping should ensure a fruitful future			0
he is good enough to play alongside @entity97 just as a batsman , too			0
@entity100 's @entity99 ( left ) is tipped to become an @entity16 limited - overs star this year @entity103 - @entity102 ( by @entity104 ) the only @entity2 athlete to top the world merit rankings for 2014 - despite spending much of the season injured - the 21 - year - old completed just one heptathlon last year , winning the @entity110 in @entity111 , before being ruled out of the @entity112 and @entity113 with injury			1
victory in @entity111 , with a personal best of 6,682 points , was a breakthrough and 2015 is where she is expected to win her first major senior medal			1
she will compete at the @entity123 in @entity124 in august , and former @entity126 champion @entity125 believes @entity127 can win gold in @entity129 and break her own world - record score of 7,291 , set in 1988			1
heptathlon star @entity102 is expected to win her first major senior medal this year one to watch : @entity132 over 200m , @entity133 became the second fastest 17 - year - old in history last july - the only man to run faster at that age is @entity138			1
he will bid for @entity140 gold this year			2
@entity133 became the second fastest 17 - year - old in history over 200m @entity143 - @entity142 ( by @entity144 ) the obvious choice is the only choice			1
the @entity16 head coach will find himself in the hottest of hot seats when it comes to the highlight of this sporting year - the rugby @entity61 in this country in september and october			1
@entity16 must find a way out of pool a containing mighty rivals in @entity155 and @entity156			1
the doomsday scenario of the hosts being ditched from their own party so early is enough to keep the coaches and their @entity162 employers awake at night			0
@entity142 endured intense criticism in november and admitted that it served as useful preparation for what awaits him nine months from now			1
as a relative novice at @entity169 , he will face a monumental and very public challenge of his credentials			0
@entity16 head coach @entity142 will be hoping to lead the host nation to glory at the @entity61 this year one to watch : @entity174 @entity175 ’s cross-code recruit @entity174 , 26 , is undertaking a crash - course in the nuances of union , with his every move analysed amid a raging debate about his best position			1
meanwhile , the @entity16 coaches are desperate to pick him as soon as he has shown the faintest grasp of a whole new ball game			1
his quest to claim a fast - track call - up for the @entity61 is the most intriguing personal tale of the year			1
a nation is willing him on			0
@entity175 's @entity174 ( left ) is getting to grips with rugby union having only switched codes recently @entity195 - @entity194 ( by @entity196 ) it is never easy following up a banner year but it will be surprising if @entity194 does not manage it in 2015			1
ok , a date in a courtroom to settle a legal battle with his former management company is hardly the place a world no 1 should be in february , just two months before the masters			2
against that , the @entity209 could hardly have come up with a better set of major venues			2
three will be on courses that fit his eye , with the fun beginning with his first tilt at the career @entity219 at @entity220 in april			2
and if he wins there , with @entity222 for @entity223 and @entity224 for the @entity225 to come , he might never stop			0
@entity226 1 golfer @entity194 will be aiming to complete a career @entity219 at the masters in april one to watch : @entity229 a first invitation to the @entity228 was recognition of cracking the top 50 and if the 27 - year - old keeps his focus , it might be the top 20 this time next year for the @entity237			1
@entity229 's impressive golf form means the 27 - year - old could break into the top 20 if he keeps his focus @entity242 - @entity241 ( by @entity243 ) there can not be many excuses for @entity241 not producing his best			1
losing members of his coaching staff and the slog towards the top after back surgery were mitigating circumstances last year , and finishing as world no 6 was commendable			0
but now he has had time to settle with new coach @entity256 and if he is going to add to his two majors - his best chance remains @entity259 - there is no time to waste because he is 28 in may			2
adding a more aggressive dimension to his play means going against his counter-punching instincts , but he has to evolve			0
at 33 , @entity264 has shown it is never too late			0
@entity241 will be looking to recapture the form of 2013 after a disappointing season last year one to watch : @entity268 only 19 and very self - assured , @entity269 showed what he can do by beating @entity271 at @entity259			2
he has natural , easy power , and 52 is a precocious ranking for a teenager			0
but the year after a breakthrough can be tough			0
@entity268 caused one of the upsets of the season when he beat @entity271 at @entity259 last year @entity279 ( by @entity280 ) @entity282 fans should thank the @entity284 board members who outvoted chairman @entity286 ’s intention to ditch @entity287			0
the result is a world - class showdown , for @entity287 versus @entity290 represents a test of each man ’s mettle in the autumn of their careers			0
it is also a clash of styles			0
@entity287 , 35 later this month , is a resilient character who accumulates points quietly			0
@entity290 , 33 , is fiery yet brittle			0
@entity287 outscored @entity301 at @entity284			0
if he does the same against @entity290 , rated the most complete driver by most , he might even get another contract			0
@entity287 will be racing in @entity282 next season after keeping his seat ahead of @entity306 one to watch : @entity307 @entity2 ’s first @entity309 champion since @entity301 , @entity307 , 23 , will either be handed a drive this year - possibly by @entity311 , for whom he has tested - or will probably never be heard of in @entity282 again			2
23 - year - old @entity307 became @entity2 's first @entity309 champion in 2014 since @entity301 boxing - @entity314 ( by @entity315 ) if he can overcome all the boxing politics , this year could bring @entity314 the opportunity to challenge the top two pound - for - pound fighters on the planet and perhaps even claim that mythical title for himself			1
@entity321 and @entity322 are the greats in the sights of @entity326 ’s courageous ambassador for @entity328 relations			0
on the evidence of his victories in 2014 over @entity331 and @entity332 , he has the speed and maturing style to give them a helluva fight - unless they get in the ring with each other in the richest bout of all time			2
if that does get in @entity314 ’s way , a @entity342 with @entity343 could refill @entity346			0
@entity314 ( left ) secured an unanimous points victory over @entity332 in @entity348 last month one to watch : @entity349 at 24 , the youngest of @entity352 ’s four brothers who hold various domestic titles , @entity349 is seen as the hottest prospect and a potential super-middleweight championship successor to @entity356			0
@entity349 is seen as a potential super-middleweight championship successor to @entity356			0

@entity12 is likely to become @entity24 and @entity16 's all - time record goalscorer this *calendar* year
heptathlon star @entity102 is expected to win her first major senior medal this year at the @entity123
@entity194 will be aiming to complete a golf @entity219 at the masters
@entity142 will hope to lead @entity16 to rugby @entity61 glory
