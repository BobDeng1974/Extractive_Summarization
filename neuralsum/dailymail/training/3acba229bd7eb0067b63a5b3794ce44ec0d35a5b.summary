by @entity0 last updated at 3:41 pm on 21st february 2012 if you think a garage is just a place to park a car , once you have looked through these photos , you may be left wondering what is hidden behind every garage door near you			1
for years what goes on behind the closed doors has remained a mystery for most women with many people considering it to be a ' man only ' zone			1
but @entity16 has lifted the lid on this extraordinary space , travelling @entity19 to find the most bizarre and fascinating ways in which men use their garage			1
@entity24 heaven : @entity26 's garage is bigger than his house and he uses it to store his @entity24 motorcycles and other @entity24 paraphernalia , including a @entity24 pinball machine and @entity24 jukebox crammed with cars : @entity34 has a garage filled with 10 @entity36 , @entity36 memorabilia and with three hot rods and a dragster for the love of cars : @entity41 spends his time sitting in his tiny garage filled with an assortment of car parts for restoring @entity46 multi-functional space : @entity48 has a 5,000 - square - foot garage where he works on @entity51 cars and at weekends uses the space to enjoy his hobby of @entity55 reenactment intriguing challenge : @entity16 scoured @entity19 to find the most bizarre and fascinating ways in which men use their garages and even managed to make a book of her findings , photographing 50 garages @entity16 , who moved to @entity19 from @entity63 25 years ago , left her @entity65 home in search some extraordinary characters and even managed to make a book of her findings			1
@entity69 snapped the inside of 50 garages and captured a whole host of bizarre collections including a retired plumber turned artist whose garage is filled with more than 800 decorated toilet seats			1
she also met a palaeontologist who is erecting a 70 - foot - long brontosaurus in his garage and a man who works in his garage , building wooden crosses for each @entity19 soldier killed in @entity84			1
@entity69 , who has since published her book called ' @entity86 ' , said the whole experience was very extraordinary			2
pedal power : @entity89 has collected more than 100 toy pedal cars and proudly displays them on shelves in his sizeable garage beyond these four walls : @entity94 , a former @entity95 pilot is using his garage space as a workshop to build his own airplane gladiator garage : @entity100 , who has always been mesmerised by gladiators and medieval knights , poses in the suit of armour that he made in his garage back garden bar : @entity107 , a history buff , has captured the era of the 1940s and 1950s in his garage , including the town soda fountain that he enjoyed as a boy and the gas pumps his father used when he ran a service station in the 1930s snapping the snapper : @entity119 has a garage full of cameras and other gear he uses as a cameraman and cinematographer she said : ' the idea to do it just sort of dawned on me one day after watching the behaviour of one of my neighbours			2
one in particular used his garage as a decompression place			2
' in the @entity135 there 's obviously very much a shed culture and the shed is known to be a place occupied by men			2
' but watching my neighbours made me realise there is an equivalent here in @entity19 too and that 's the garage			0
' it 's somewhere they can go to pursue projects or just chill out but it seems to be a very necessary space for men			0
' i love people and i think people are really what made me excited about the whole project			0
' i got to spend time with a wide variety of people and they welcomed me into their space			0
' they do n't necessarily want to share the space with people all the time but when they find somebody who is interested in what 's going on in their garage , they 're interested in talking about it			0
' i would spend some time with one man and by the end of the shoot he would be saying you 've got to see my friend			0
it was very much a serendipitous process			0
' all of the men featured in the book threw their garage doors wide open and basically said come in , let me tell you about it			1
' commemoration space : @entity174 works in his garage , building wooden crosses for each @entity19 soldier killed in @entity84 history in the making : palaeontologist @entity180 , uses his space to erect a 65 - million - year - old sailback edaphosaur skeleton all the mod cons : @entity185 has a garage that not only serves to house his motorcycles , but also as his office and playroom , complete with sofa , desk and surround - sound tv parking space meets poker : @entity195 has turned his garage into a nightclub complete with dance floor , a poker table and a smoke machine place of dreams : ninety - two - year - old @entity107 spent hours building his beloved locomotive in his garage totally potty : retired plumber turned artist , @entity205 , has filled his garage with more than 800 decorated toilet seats			0
