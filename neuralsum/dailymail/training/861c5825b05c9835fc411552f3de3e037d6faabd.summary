gone are the days when we were simply meat - eaters or vegetarians			0
over the past few years , soaring numbers of people have opted to become vegans , pescetarians and fruitarians			0
now , there is the rise of the reducetarian - someone who cuts back on meat , but does n't give it up entirely			1
advocates say the move not only boosts health , but benefits the environment - and is easier to achieve than the more radical options			2
rising numbers of people are becoming ' reducetarians '			2
they are committing to eating less meat , seafood and dairy for health and environmental reasons			1
but they are not giving up these products altogether @entity28 , the founder of the @entity30 blog , who coined the phrase , is now urging people to take the 30 day ' less meat ' pledge			1
he is asking people to commit to eating less , higher quality meat and reducing their dairy and seafood consumption over a month , and hopefully continue this lifestyle afterwards			1
he hopes to bring together a community of other groups , known as semi-vegetarians and flexitarians , who also eat mainly a plant - based diet but also eat environmentally - sustainable levels of meat , dairy and seafood			1
eating less meat is easy , healthy and good for the environment , he says			1
previous studies have shown vegans and vegetarians live for longer than meat - eaters , and in november , a landmark @entity54 study claimed switching to a plant - based diet could help reverse diabetes			2
mr @entity28 argues there are also strong environmental reasons for giving up animal produce			2
' we know our planet is in trouble , and we know that meat production from the clearing of lands and trees to the transportation of these products , accounts for nearly 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions , ' he said in a @entity71 that aired in november			0
mr @entity28 has the following tips for putting reducetarianism into practice : if you eat meat for lunch , skip it for dinner			1
participate in @entity79 , or choose your own day			0
eat grass - fed meat instead of conventionally produced factory farmed livestock			2
reduce your portion ( i.e. 8 oz instead of 16 oz steak )			0
' that is why a vegetarian 's footprint is nearly half that of a meat lover 's			0
and for a vegan , it 's even lower			0
' meat production also requires a lot of water ; producing one pound of meat protein requires 10 times the amount of water as producing grain protein , he said			0
becoming a reducetarian and pledging to eat less , but better quality meat , is the perfect solution , he said			1
' by choosing to eat meat sometimes , as opposed to never eating meat , you alter your moral standards for primal urges and convenience , ' mr @entity28 said			1
these seemingly innocuous labels used to describe our eating choices matter a great deal			0
' they determine how seriously we are taken , how our messages are understood , and our feeling of belonging			0
' becoming a reducetarian is appealing because it means people do n't have to completely give up meat , and can still eat dairy products like eggs , cheese and milk			1
mr @entity28 believes his theory will be successful as people are much likely to take up a reducetarian diet , whereas for many , becoming vegetarian or vegan is too drastic and unfeasible			1
in fact , research from the @entity129 published in december found 84 per cent of vegetarians and vegans eventually gave up the lifestyle choice			0
mr @entity28 saysreducing meat , seafood and dairy consumption and eating more fruit and vegetables means reducetarians will lead ' longer , healthier , happier lives ' as well as reducing the impact on the environment more than half ( 53 per cent ) started eating meat again within a year , and almost a third ( 30 per cent ) relapsing within just three months			1
mr @entity28 said reducing meat consumption , rather than completely giving it up , would see more people sticking to their pledge long - term			1
he added : ' we need a word that describes a community of individuals who are committed to reducing their consumption of meat			0
. this is so they can encourage others to reduce their consumption of cows , chickens , pigs , lambs , and seafood			0
' ' @entity162 is the practice of reducing one 's personal consumption of meat : red meat , seafood , and poultry			2
' with more consumption of fruit and veggies , reducetarians will live longer , healthier , happier lives			0

' eating less meat is easy , healthy and good for the environment ' , he says
