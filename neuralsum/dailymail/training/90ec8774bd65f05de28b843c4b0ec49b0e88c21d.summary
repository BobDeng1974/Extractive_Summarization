by @entity1 reporter published : 16:13 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 08:32 est , 19 june 2012 @entity2 has been cleared of all charges as a jury decided he did n't lie to @entity5 when he denied using performance - enhancing drugs , closing the book on a five - year saga that had the former pitcher 's impressive career clouded by allegations of steroid use			1
jurors returned their verdict monday after close to 10 hours of deliberation			0
the verdict brought an end to a 10 - week trial that capped an expensive , five - year probe into one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball , who pitched for the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 in his 24 - year career			1
the charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during his career			0
outside the courthouse , @entity2 thanked his family members and the former teammates for their support during the intense legal battle			0
fighting back tears , the man known as ' @entity2 ' again pushed aside claims that he used performance enhancing substances , saying : ' i put a lot of hard work into that career			1
' smiles : @entity2 walks out of court with his wife @entity62 , left , after his acquittal in the perjury case the verdict is the latest blow to the government 's pursuit of athletes accused of drug use			1
the government 's case relied heavily on the testimony of @entity2 ' longtime strength coach , @entity74 , who testified that he injected @entity75 with steroids in 1998 , 2000 and 2001 and with @entity77 in 2000			2
@entity74 produced a needle and other materials he said were from a steroids injection of @entity2 in 2001 , items that @entity74 said he stored in and around a @entity85 beer can inside a @entity82 box for some six years			0
but @entity74 was the only person to claim firsthand knowledge of @entity2 using steroids and @entity77 , and even prosecutors conceded their star witness was a ' flawed man			0
' star witness : @entity74 , @entity2 ' strength coach , said that he injected the former pitcher with steroids on several different occasions			0
he was the only witness to claim firsthand knowledge of @entity2 using steroids a force on the field : @entity2 won the @entity98 seven times and was crowned @entity100 in 1986 @entity74 was arrested in 2001 for allegedly raping a woman in a @entity103 hotel pool who was later found to have ingested a date rape drug			1
the rape case was one detail that @entity2 ' lawyers used in their relentless attacks on @entity74 's credibility and integrity			2
they also pointed out that his story had changed over the years and implied that he conjured up the allegations against @entity2 to placate federal investigators			2
some items associated with the beer can were found to have @entity2 ' dna and steroids , but the defence called the evidence ' garbage ' and claimed it was contaminated or manipulated by @entity74 , a former @entity122 police officer			0
dubbed ' @entity2 ' during his baseball career , @entity2 has been dodging allegations that he had used performance enhancing drugs since his name appeared in the @entity128 in 2007			1

with @entity2 ' acquittal , the sports world will wait to see the results of the @entity141 vote , as @entity2 will be eligible for induction for the first time			2
other eligible names , including former sluggers @entity145 and @entity147 , have also had highly impressive careers , but have not received baseball 's highest honour due mostly to allegations of drug use			1
when @entity2 does appear on a hall of fame ballot next year , his name will appear with home run king @entity154 , whose record - breaking numbers have also been called into question due to alleged steroid use			1
@entity2 capped an outstanding career with age - defying performances well into his 40s			2
he won a seventh @entity98 - the most among any other pitcher - at the age of 41 after going 18 - 4 in 2004 with the @entity27			0
in addition , his 4,672 strikeouts rank him third all - time			2

he first appeared at a congressional deposition , where he said : ' i never used steroids			0
never performance - enhancing steroids			1
' he made a similarly categorical denial at a hearing about a week later , appearing alongside @entity74 , who stuck to his story			0
