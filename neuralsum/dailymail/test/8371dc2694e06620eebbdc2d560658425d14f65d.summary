reports claim @entity3 is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones , tablets and even electric cars ( pictured ) can run for			1
sources told the @entity20 that the four - man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable the reports were made by @entity24 in the @entity20			1
@entity3 has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former @entity27 battery expert dr @entity26 began leading a testing team			1
mr @entity24 explained that dr. @entity26 recently described how ' solid - state , thin - film batteries could be used in smartphones and other mobile devices that are thinner , bendable , wearable and even implantable in the human body			0
' he also referenced a video for @entity36 that revealed how @entity3 has been working with experts at @entity38 to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures			1
this is vital for @entity3 's @entity36 balloons designed to float near the stratosphere and provide internet to wider areas			1
@entity3 has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former @entity27 battery expert dr @entity26 began leading a testing team			1
in a video for @entity36 ( pictured ) , @entity3 revealed it has been working with experts at @entity38 to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures fan site @entity51 recently spotted nine job listings on @entity27 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries			1
these include one for an @entity58 battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for @entity60 power systems engineer ( pictured right ) the @entity38 technology uses wax and a graphite material , for example , to help lithium - ion batteries absorb heat and spread it across the power pack			1
last week , a team of @entity71 chemists unveiled an aluminium battery that can recharge in less than 60 seconds			1
@entity27 defines the @entity74 battery on its @entity76 product page			1
it says its all - day battery life is based on 18 hours of use			2
all - day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music			2
audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music			0
talk time : @entity27 said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls			2
workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on			0
watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour			0
power reserve : when the @entity93 's battery gets low it switches into @entity104 mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour			1
charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge			0
@entity27 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production @entity93 and software paired with an @entity114 using pre-production software			1
@entity27 said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary it is said to be the first high - performance aluminium battery which is ' fast - charging , long - lasting and inexpensive ' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries			1
it also ca n't catch fire like lithium - ion technology			0
at present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity , the highest achieved yet with aluminium , ' but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of existing technology			0
and @entity3 is n't the only tech giant working on such plans			2
last month , @entity27 began recruiting for experts to help boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops			1
at least nine job listings were discovered by fan site @entity51 and include listings for an @entity58 battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer			2
in particular , the @entity58 software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends			2
' @entity160 also recently announced its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) that can be fitted to a variety of gadgets and are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body			2
the @entity170 microcontrollers are part of @entity160 's 32 - bit @entity173 - based @entity162 range and are powered by chip maker @entity173 's @entity174 + 32 - bit processors			2
a number of @entity27 devices , including the @entity178 and @entity179 are powered by chips based around @entity173 technology			0
a team of @entity71 chemists recently unveiled an aluminium battery that can fully recharge in less than 60 seconds			0
it is said to be the first high - performance aluminium battery which is ' fast - charging , long - lasting and inexpensive ' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries last month , @entity160 released its latest microcontrollers ( @entity162 ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body			1
@entity160 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' @entity160 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas			0
' they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made			0
the microcontrollers run on the firm 's @entity217 technology and @entity160 's @entity219 that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks			0
by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery			0
it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible			0
plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature			0
during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity160 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel			0
this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge			0

reports claim @entity3 is latest firm to test *alternative* battery *options*
sources said the four - man team devise and test different technologies
it follows @entity27 's recruitment drive for battery and software experts
