as a two - year - old , he donated his bone marrow to try and help save his older sister			1
the selfless act gave her an extra five years of life , allowing her to live into her teens			0
but today @entity8 is desperate for his own transplant , after doctors revealed he is suffering the same rare syndrome that claimed his sister @entity12 's life at just 15			1
his family are distraught , having been told there is no match for their son on any bone marrow registers across the world			1
it is the 10 - year - old 's @entity22 heritage that makes it more difficult to locate a donor , after his family were found to be inappropriate matches			2
' we desperately need a donor for @entity8 and we now know there is not currently anyone on any of the world 's registers who is a match for him			1
' however , it is also really important to us to help other people who are looking for donors			0
' the only thing we have is hope and more donors on the register mean more hope for all patients in need of a transplant			0
' @entity12 was diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita - a rare illness that causes bone marrow failure - when she was nine years old			1
@entity68 is a disorder that affects many parts of the body			0
the three main features are that the finger and toenails grow poorly , or are abnormally shaped , changes in skin colouring especially on the neck and chest and white patches inside the mouth			0
sufferers have an increased risk of developing several life - threatening conditions			0
they are very susceptible to disorders that cause the bone marrow to fail , affecting the bone marrow 's ability to produce new blood cells			2
it can cause aplastic anaemia , also known as bone marrow failure , which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells			1
those diagnosed with the condition are also at an increased risk of leukaemia			2
initially doctors believed she was suffering severe aplastic anaemia - a condition where the bone marrow fails to make enough red blood cells for the body			1
but doctors soon realised the diagnosis was wrong and discovered the much rarer dyskeratosis congenita illness was to blame			1
her devastated family were told she would need a bone marrow transplant			1
all three of her siblings - her two older sisters , and her younger brother - were tested and @entity8 was found to be a match			2
he was only two at the time , but in april 2007 , @entity8 donated bone marrow to his sister			1
despite the transplant , @entity12 was left dependent on platelet and blood transfusions and she launched a campaign to encourage more people to become blood , organ , and bone marrow donors			1
in 2010 , @entity12 's lungs collapsed and were left so badly damaged that she was told her illness was incurable			0
despite her failing health , she continued to organise fundraising events and to inspire @entity130 people to become donors			0
she died at @entity39 five years after her transplant			2
@entity8 donated his bone marrow to help extend his sister 's life when he was just two years old @entity8 now desperately needs a bone marrow transplant and with no matches available , his family are urging people to sign the register in the hope it will save his life two years after the 15 - year - old 's death , in october 2014 , @entity8 suffered a series of colds that he could n't shake off			1
he became increasingly breathless and recognising the signs , mrs @entity37 contacted the specialists at @entity39 that had treated her daughter			0
tests confirmed the family 's fears - @entity8 has the same rare illness that claimed his sister 's life			1
his mother was told he too would need a bone marrow transplant to give him the greatest chance of survival			1
his doctors turned to the charity @entity159 asking them to search the world 's registers for a potential match			0
but this search failed , prompting @entity8 's family to issue a desperate plea for more people to sign the register			2
they have been warned it is more difficult to find a match because the 10 - year - old is from @entity22 heritage and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are under represented on the registers			2
ms @entity37 urged more people from @entity130 backgrounds to sign up			0
' signing up is about saving someone 's life , ' she said			0
' it is that important and it is particularly vital to encourage people from ethnic minority backgrounds to sign up			0
' if you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health you can sign the @entity159 register at their website here .			0
