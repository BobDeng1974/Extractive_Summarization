ricin plot conspirator @entity7 and ' liquid bomber ' @entity10 have today taken their legal battle to the @entity12			1
it follows a ruling in march 2012 when they failed to persuade appeal judges that their treatment was unlawful			1
they were alleged to have intimidated and bullied other inmates over matters of faith , so the authorities in their respective jails decided to separate them from other prisoners ' for good order and discipline '			1

their qc @entity36 told the @entity12 today : ' the issue in these appeals is one of fairness			1
' she said : ' fairness requires that prisoners should be provided with sufficient information about the reasons and evidence relied on to justify the initial decision to segregate them , and their continuing segregation , so as to enable them to make meaningful and effective representations in their defence			2
killer : @entity54 , an @entity55 , is also serving a life sentence for murdering detective constable @entity7 , 40 , pictured with a kitchen knife during his 2003 arrest at a flat in @entity61 ' fairness also requires that , at least once it is apparent that the segregation is not simply a short - term measure , prisoners should be afforded the opportunity to challenge the decision to segregate them before a body that is independent of the prison , and which is empowered to determine whether the factual case against them is made out and whether their continued segregation is justified			1
' @entity54 , an @entity55 , is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the @entity81 terrorist plot			2
he is also serving a life sentence for murdering detective constable @entity7 , 40 , with a kitchen knife during his 2003 arrest at a flat in @entity61			2

they were ' not informed of what they were required to do in order for their segregation to end , and were not afforded the opportunity to challenge the relevant decisions before an independent body '			0
hearing : the @entity12 in @entity128 has set aside two days to consider if the dangerous prisoners were badly treated she argued that ' in the circumstances ' , the decisions to segregate them and to continue that segregation were ' unlawful '			1
ms @entity36 told the court : ' in each case there was said to be a suspicion that the appellants had been involved in assaults on other prisoners			0
' in neither case was there sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges or sustain internal prison disciplinary charges against them			0
' both men , she said , were held in segregation in different prisons for approximately six months and during that time they were locked alone in a cell for 23 hours a day and permitted only one hour of exercise a day , ' which had to be taken alone in a cage '			2
the @entity156 submitted that there were a number of reasons why ' stringent standards of fairness must be applied ' , including the serious effects of segregation on prisoners , particularly when it was prolonged			2
' it is accepted that segregation carries a high risk of deterioration in mental health , and that after the segregation has continued for a period in excess of two weeks there is a risk of irreparable damage to the prisoner , ' she said			0
