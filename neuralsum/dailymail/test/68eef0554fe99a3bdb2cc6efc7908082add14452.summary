a @entity1 woman is doing all she can to stop the city from tearing down the house that has housed three generations of her family			1
@entity6 , 79 , has lived in her home for 70 years , and was a member of the first @entity11 - @entity10 family to live in her neighborhood , and now it and 49 others , may be bulldozed			1
this so the city can make way for a campus for the @entity17			1
' it was 1945 , and there was a restrictive covenant restricting where @entity11 - @entity10 could live			0
but , nonetheless , my father was successful in buying this house for our large family			0
' that may all go away though , now that the city needs to keep the @entity17 , and the 3,000 jobs it provides , in @entity1			1
the company creates maps and satellite imagery that is used by the military for national security , among other things			0
and if residents are not willing to move , the city says it will resort to eminent domain to take their homes			2
that would not just mean the loss of @entity6 's home , but more importantly the loss of a lifetime of memories			1
' we celebrated everything in here , and there was always something going on , ' she said			0
' during @entity68 , dozens of kids would be here : all my siblings , cousins and , later on , their children and children ’s children			0
' @entity6 is pictured here at age 9 ( in the upper right corner ) with her siblings the city may also tear down 49 other homes in addition to @entity6 's ( above ) to make sure the @entity17 does not leave the city , and take the 3,000 jobs it provides @entity6 also pointed out that many of the other people who could lose their residences are elderly , adding ; ' our homes are not for sale			1
' a change.org petition has been started , and already there are over 90,000 signatures			0
three other sites are being considered and a decision is expected in march 2016			2
as @entity6 says in her petition ; ' we ’ve lived in this neighborhood for generations and do not want to move			2

@entity6 , 79 , may have her home of 70 years torn down by the city of @entity1
this so the city can make way for a campus for the @entity17
the city may also tear down 49 other homes to make sure the @entity17 does not leave the city , and take the 3,000 jobs it provides
there are three other sites being looked at that would not displace as many people
