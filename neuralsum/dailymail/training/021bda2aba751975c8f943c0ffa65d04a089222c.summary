the government tonight lost another vote in the @entity2 over its plans to shake - up the welfare system			0
peers rejected plans for a ' bedroom tax ' on under - occupied council houses by a majority of 10			1
the amended @entity10 will now have to be sent back to the @entity11 however , the government are likely to stand - firm and overturn the changes			1
defeat : peers tonight voted through an amendment to the government 's @entity15 and it will have to be sent back to the @entity11 ( file photo ) it is the latest @entity2 defeat in the battle between the two houses over plans to cap benefits at £ 26,000 per year			1
the plans will save the taxpayer £ 290million in 2013 - 14 and are designed to encourage benefit claimants to get back to work			1
under the draft legislation , people in council properties will lose £ 14 per week in state handouts for every spare room they have from next april			1
peers voted by 236 votes to 226 to exempt the disabled , war widows and foster carers from the proposed £ 14 cut			1
six @entity40 rebels voted in favour of the amendment - in defiance of government policy			0
the exemptions - proposed by crossbench peer @entity46 - will cost around £ 100million			2
@entity46 insisted his amendment would not remove the pressure on ' scroungers ' who were able to work and was targeted at those who needed help			0
he said : ' these are households for whom pressures to take a job , a key policy driver for the government ... are not relevant			0
for these people the penalty simply represents a substantial loss of income with no escape			2
' reforms : @entity66 , the @entity67 , wants to cut state handouts to £ 26,000 - per - year he added that it was unfair that people would face the benefits cut automatically from next april if no new properties are available - even if they are prepared to move			1
he told the @entity2 : ' to suddenly impose the under occupation penalty on all these households before they have any chance to move elsewhere seems most unjust			0
' he added : ' the new amendment confines the postponement of the imposition of the bedroom tax to certain categories only rather than to all tenants			1
' i deeply regret abandoning hundreds of thousands of households , who even if this amendment is approved , will still be caught by the penalty charge on april 1 next year , even if they are willing to move , but are trapped where they are because there are no smaller flats available			0
' however , needs must and the new amendment reduces the cost in the early years , from perhaps a maximum of £ 300million by around half , a far cry from the billions referred to in earlier debate			2
' @entity100 's @entity99 of @entity101 backed @entity46 and said the government 's cuts were hitting the most vulnerable			0
she told peers : ' families with a disabled child can lose £ 14 a week while most of us enjoy a tax - free winter fuel allowance , or find for the second year running that our council tax has been frozen			1
' not a penny of these cuts are falling on me , and i suspect on very few of you , and yet we are asking disabled families and families with disabled children to carry those cuts for us			0
' shadow work and pensions secretary @entity119 said : ' @entity2 voted today to protect war widows , carers and disabled people from having instant rent cuts and potentially becoming homeless			1
' to propose the idea shows just how far this government has now left basic decency behind			0
the government attempted this desperate cut because they 've let the unemployment bill spiral out of control			0
' what they should focus on now is boosting the number of taxpayers by getting more people back into jobs			2
' the @entity15 has already endured a difficult time in the @entity2 , where peers have inflicted a series of defeats on ministers			2
earlier this month @entity143 threw out a series of changes made by peers			0
the decision tonight to back @entity46 's amendment means the @entity15 will now have to go back to the @entity148 again			1
the latest round in the welfare reform battle protracted session of parliamentary ' ping pong ' with the legislation being sent between the two chambers until agreement can be reached .			0
