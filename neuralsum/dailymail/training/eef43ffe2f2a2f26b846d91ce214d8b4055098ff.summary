by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 12 february 2013 millions of @entity2 tv viewers could lose their signal as a result of new high speed 4g mobile phone signals			1
the firm set up to monitor the problem today admitted it was in a race against time to distribute filters to an estimated 2.3 million viewers before the networks go live in the summer			1
40,000 homes will lose their signal entirely , and will be forced to use alternatives such as satellite or cable to receive a tv signal			1
bad reception : the introduction of @entity21 mobile networks could cause problems for over 2 million @entity2 tv viewers - with a race against time underway to get them filters in time			1
with the switch - over of tv services to digital , a band of frequencies previously used by tv is being made available for phone firms to offer high speed 4g services			0
this 800 mhz band is currently being auctioned by @entity36 to companies that wish to provide @entity21 services			0
in certain circumstances , it is possible that new 4g services at 800 @entity42 could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital tv signals , meaning viewers will need to fit a filter or , in around 40,000 cases , use cable or satellite providers			1
@entity49 , a new company funded by £ 180m of the proceeds of the ongoing @entity21 radio spectrum auction , is in charge of the problem			0
the auction is expected to finish later this month , allowing mobile operators to begin building the 4g networks by the summer			1
' we need to be fully operational by march to be in place to mitigate any interference issues , ' said @entity60 , a telecoms industry veteran today appointed as chief executive of @entity49			0
' i look forward to working closely with broadcasters and mobile network operators to ensure everyone continues to be able to receive their current tv service			0
' he told @entity70 engineers will be able to predict where interference will occur , based on a ' sophisticated model ' developed with the mobile operators			0
' we expect to be able to identify affected households			1
' we will need to procure millions [ of filters ] in the first instance , ' he said			0
' we ’re focused on being able to provide anyone who may be affected with the information and equipment they ’ll need to ensure they continue to receive free - to - air tv			1
' the launch of @entity21 networks could leave up to 2.3million consumers without tv services - unless they fit a filter the areas likely to be worst hit identified by @entity36 include those served by the @entity92 transmitter in @entity93 and the @entity95 transmitter in @entity96			2
however , the firm has not yet revealed detailed information of the affected areas			2
the services are not the first @entity21 networks to operate in the @entity2			2
however , @entity104 ’s @entity103 , operating in major cities , does not interfere with television signals because it reuses the @entity107 radio spectrum band originally allocated for @entity109 mobile networks			2
the @entity111 band , ideal for covering rural areas with @entity21 , is likely to interfere , however , as digital terrestrial television uses the adjacent @entity115 band			0
of the 2.3 million potentially affected homes , regulators have calculated that for almost 40,000 could permanently lose their @entity119 signal because a filter will be ineffective			1
the chairman of @entity49 , @entity121 , said , ' ensuring @entity2 ’s terrestrial tv continues uninterrupted while @entity2 benefits from @entity21 at 800 @entity42 is a huge responsibility			0
' 200,000 watts of lighting illuminate the 219 metre tall @entity92 broadcast tower , as part of @entity128 's " @entity127 "			0
now viewers could suffer again as @entity21 networks are launched			2

up to 2.3 million households could be affected by new networks
