by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 12:02 est , 3 january 2014 no parole : @entity4 kidnapper @entity3 enters the courtroom in @entity6 @entity7 was yesterday accused of planning to ' kow - tow ' to @entity10 human rights judges and scrap the country 's toughest jail sentences			1
so - called ' whole - life ' terms , which condemn the most dangerous serial killers to die behind bars , could be replaced by ' @entity18 - style , 100 - year terms '			1
but crucially , unlike many states in the @entity18 , the new sentences in @entity20 will come with an automatic review – potentially allowing murderers who would otherwise have stayed in jail to be released back on to the streets			1
the proposal has infuriated @entity28 backbenchers			1
last night @entity29 said : ' the trouble with 100 - year sentences is they can be reviewed and reduced and people could be let out			1
for certain people , life should mean life – in prison for the rest of their lives			2
' @entity41 is set to change the law to comply with a @entity44 judgment , which found life sentences without any prospect of parole amounted to a breach of killers ' human rights			1
in july , the court ruled all inmates , however long their sentences , should have a chance at proving they have changed their ways and are no longer a threat to the public			2
without a review mechanism , such sentences amounted to ' inhuman and degrading treatment ' and breached @entity64 3 of the @entity65 , the judges said			2
when the ruling was released , mr @entity7 's spokesman said the prime minister ' profoundly disagreed ' and was a ' strong supporter of whole - life tariffs '			1
but less than six months later he appears ready to bow to @entity72 's demands			0
yesterday mr @entity7 tried to appear tough on the issue			0
he told @entity74 : ' what i think is very clear , there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life			0
whatever the @entity10 court has said , we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue			0
' but he failed to rule out changes to the ' whole - life ' regime , which is reserved for killers and rapists deemed so depraved they can never be let out			1
in the @entity18 , many criminals are given lengthy sentences with no chance of release			0
last year @entity4 kidnapper and rapist @entity3 was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 1,000 years without parole			2
he was later found dead in his cell			0
last night pressure was mounting on mr @entity7			0
mr @entity29 said : ' we should ignore the ruling of this @entity104 court in @entity72 and do what the @entity20 people want			0
' prime minister @entity7 has been accused of planning to ' kow - tow ' to @entity10 human rights judges @entity109 , of the @entity110 , said : ' the abolition of whole - life sentences is a backward step			1
this proposal means that every murderer , no matter how grotesque their crimes , has an automatic right to parole hearings			2
what is the point of having elections if governments always end up kow - towing to the @entity44 ? ' the @entity72 case was brought by three convicted killers given whole - life sentences who demanded the right to a parole hearing – @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
there 52 individuals serving such terms			0
the @entity72 court said all must be allowed a review of their sentence , with release following if they can prove they have been successfully ' rehabilitated '			0
it suggested the whole - lifers should be given a review after 25 years inside and every few years afterwards			2
there is also pressure to amend the law from senior judges			0
in october , mr @entity147 said it was ' not appropriate ' to give triple killer @entity149 a whole - life sentence because of the @entity72 decree			1
the same judge is due to sentence the @entity154 killers of @entity155 – @entity156 and @entity157 .			0

so - called ' whole - life ' terms could be replaced by 100 - year terms
but crucially the new sentences will come with automatic review
the proposal has infuriated @entity28 backbenchers
