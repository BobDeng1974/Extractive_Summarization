by @entity0 @entity1 , a gray wolf that has wandered all over @entity3 and beyond after being collared with a gps device , may have found a mate			1
wildlife authorities said cameras in the southern @entity8 captures several images of what appears to be a female wolf in the same area where @entity1 's collar shows where he has been living			0
it is likely the pair spawned pups , officials said , and if confirmed , the rare predators would be the first breeding pair of wolves in the @entity3 's @entity8 since the early 1900s			1
@entity1 : this remote camera photo taken on may 3 shows the tagged wolf , which has traveled for thousands of miles in search of a mate @entity29 biologist @entity28 said it is not proof , but it is likely the two wolves mated over the winter and are rearing pups that would have been born in april			1
biologists wo n't start looking for a den until june , to avoid endangering the pups			0
' it 's amazing that he appears to have found a mate , ' mr @entity28 said			0
' i did n't think it would happen			0
it makes me more impressed with the ability of wolves to survive and find one another			2
' young wolves typically leave their pack and strike out for a new territory , hoping to find a mate and start a new pack			1
@entity1 has been looking for a mate since leaving the @entity53 pack in northeastern @entity3 in september 2011			1
new mate ? the @entity29 is excited after this photo , taken in the southern @entity8 , showed a different wolf in the same area as @entity58 his travels have taken him thousands of miles as he crossed highways , deserts and ranches in @entity3 , moved down the spine of the @entity8 deep into @entity66 and then back to @entity3 , all without getting shot , having an accident or starving			1
along the way , he was photographed by a hunter 's trail camera in the @entity8 outside @entity72 and by a biologist informing ranchers in @entity66 he was in the area			1
@entity77 protections for wolves have been lifted in eastern @entity3 , where the bulk of them reside , but they remain in force in the @entity8			1
protections for the animals have also ended in the last several years in the @entity84 and western @entity85			2
the @entity29 has proposed ending the listing across most of the rest of the country as populations have rebounded			0
a final decision is expected later this year			0
the battery on @entity1 's gps collar was expected to die soon , so , based on the wolf 's most recent locations , mr @entity28 placed trail cameras			0
the black and white photograph appears to have captured a female black wolf			0
experts now hope to draw a dna sample to see where this second animal has come from the gps locations also showed @entity58 was staying within a smaller area , common behavior when wolves have pups to feed			1
when he checked the cameras last week , @entity28 said he found one had recorded a black wolf he had not seen before			0
an hour later , @entity58 was photographed on the same camera			2
the black wolf was confirmed female because she squatted to urinate			2
officials had planned to let @entity1 's collar die , but now that he appears to have found a mate , he will be fitted with a new one this summer to monitor the pack			2
mr @entity28 said they had no idea where the female came from			0
if she can be captured , they can draw a dna sample to see if she is related to the @entity123 wolves that started moving into @entity3 in the 1990s			1
separately in @entity126 , an animal shot dead by a coyote hunter in february was the first gray wolf spotted in the state since at least 1925 , dna testing has confirmed.the hunter , who has n't been named , shot the female wolf near @entity132 in northwest @entity133 believing it to be a similar - looking coyote			0
it is legal to shoot coyote in @entity126 , though hunting wolves is illegal as they are a protected @entity141 closer inspection , the hunter thought the supposed coyote may have been a wolf and brought the animal to the @entity145 office in @entity146 , where biologists examined it and took dna samples .			2

@entity58 has been tracked since leaving his pack in 2011
has traveled thousands of miles from @entity3 to @entity66 and back again
if confirmed , it would be first breeding pair of wolves for 100 years
