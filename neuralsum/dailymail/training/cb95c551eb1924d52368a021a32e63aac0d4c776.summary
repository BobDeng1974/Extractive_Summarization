casualty departments were forced to close their doors to ambulances nearly 100 times last month as they failed to cope with soaring patient numbers , alarming figures show			1
in total , around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside @entity10 units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year			1
in the worst cases they were turned away altogether			0
experts warned that the ‘ bleak ’ figures were indicative of a ‘ crisis ’ in the @entity24 and showed the system was ‘ cracking under extreme pressure			0
’ and they say the situation could worsen over the next month			2
@entity24 chiefs finally released the data indicating how hospitals are coping with the pressures of winter five weeks later than planned yesterday			0
they show the situation is far worse compared with this time last year			0
waiting times data is normally released on a weekly basis from the start of november			2
but @entity36 said that it was being held back while they ‘ reviewed ’ the information – prompting concerns they were trying to delay bad news			0
the 95 occasions that overstretched casualty units had to divert ambulances to other hospitals is almost double the 48 in the same period last year			1
a total of 6,968 operations had to be cancelled – 367 which were urgent – and 33 patients waited on trolleys in corridors for more than 12 hours			1
several hospital trusts are now on ‘ black alert ’ – whereby gps are urged not to send in patients – and senior @entity24 managers in some areas of the country have admitted the situation is the worst in living memory			2
last week , more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in @entity10 – the worst figure on record the figures show @entity10 units are already under considerable pressure even though winter is barely under way			1
the crisis is partly due to bed - blocking , where elderly patients stay in hospital despite being fit for discharge because of a lack of care for them at home			2
in addition , record numbers of patients are visiting @entity10 because they are unable to get an appointment with their gp			1
separate weekly data shows that 35,373 patients waited more than four hours in @entity10 – the government ’s target – a record number since data was first published in november 2010			1
dr @entity88 , chair of the @entity90 ’s council which represents senior doctors , said : ‘ these figures point to a system cracking under extreme pressure , leading to unacceptable delays in care			0
‘ while the @entity24 is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months , this year it ’s experienced a spring , summer and autumn crisis as well , leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we hit winter			0
’ last month the government announced that @entity10 units would get an extra £ 700million to avert a winter crisis , a sum that senior doctors described as little more than a ‘ sticking plaster ’			1
dame @entity109 , @entity36 ’s national director of commissioning operations blamed the crisis on soaring numbers arriving in @entity10 and having to be admitted on to hospital wards			1
there were 436,229 attendances last week – up nearly 30,000 on the average typically seen for this time of year			0
dr @entity117 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity120 , said : ‘ last year ’s winter pressures on hospitals and @entity10 never went away – our health service is now running at capacity all year round , and a bad winter could spell disaster			2
‘ staff are working incredibly hard to care for record numbers of patients , but the system is failing both staff and patients			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity134 said the figures should be a ‘ wake - up call ’ .			0
