the prime minister has repeatedly said he wants @entity12 to remain part of a reformed @entity4			1
but mr @entity3 , tipped for promotion in the next government reshuffle , said leaving the @entity4 altogether was not something to fear			2
he insisted the best outcome of the process to change the @entity12 's relationship with @entity21 would be remaining in a reformed @entity4 more focused on free trade			1
but he told @entity51 : ‘ we can all be better off inside the @entity4 if it can change some of its ways			0
‘ but as i say , if the @entity12 people decide the decision is they want to leave the @entity4 , then that is n't something that i 'd be afraid of , i 'd embrace the opportunities that would create			1

be part of ... making sure we have a @entity100 relationship that works for @entity12 ? yes of course it can			0

‘ i think we particularly need to look at the rules on benefits			0
one of the advantages of @entity12 membership of the @entity4 is that @entity12 people go and live and work in other countries			1
but i think there is a problem with people living [ here ] and not working			0
i also think that transitional controls have been absolutely vital and we need to look at what more we can do on that front			0
’ he was asked which issues of @entity12 ’s @entity4 membership he has discussed with allies in @entity100 , including @entity121 chancellor @entity120 , who has backed calls for member states to take back powers from the @entity125 , and the @entity126 which is also concerned about the free movement of people in the 28 - member union			1

@entity164 , of the @entity166 think - tank , said : ‘ this is an issue that ranks highly among the @entity12 public ’s concerns about the @entity4 and meshes with what @entity14 actually can achieve in @entity100			2
‘ the @entity121 are sympathetic to giving countries more control over who can access benefits , in order to maintain confidence in @entity4 free movement			2
