there was an hour of daylight left in the @entity3 desert when we hopped into the @entity5			1
our guide , @entity7 , revved the engine — in another life he might have been a rally driver — and off we set			2
' @entity10 ! ' cried @entity7 , encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter , aged ten			2
@entity15 's @entity14 are classic desert terrain — the sort you get in a @entity20 film or one of those ' parched man crawls towards oasis ' newspaper cartoons			1
@entity24 of sand stretched to the horizon			2
dune bashing in @entity15 's @entity14 was a particular highlight of @entity30 ' holiday guides take guests out into the desert in @entity34 and speed through the expansive sand dunes what was most striking was the colours , at once uniform and subtly different			1
the sand was all yellow , of course , but there were valleys of brown and black , too , lengthening as the golden sun dropped			2
we surged over and through the dunes			2
' @entity50 ! ' i yelled when we seemed to be going down far too steep an incline and the car , thrillingly , was skidding sideways , throwing out a high spray of sand			1
our children cackled with laughter			2
the moment we stepped out of the 4x4 , there came a contrast : complete , refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape			2
this was the reason i 'd dug deep into the family savings and chosen @entity15 for a week 's holiday over @entity70			1
it lived up to every expectation			0
the @entity73 of @entity15 , long an ally of @entity75 , lies east of @entity76			0
to its south is troubled @entity79			0
@entity81 flights from @entity82 take seven hours to reach the @entity3 capital @entity84			1
@entity30 and his family spent a night on the country 's tallest mountain , 9,800ft @entity88 , which has a not - so - mini ' @entity89 ' for the first four days , we had the company of @entity7			1
he took us to the fortified town of @entity93 , where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on fridays			0
the nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging @entity100 tourists — when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews , she was charged the @entity3 rial equivalent of £ 3			1
' you should have haggled , ' i said			0
she told me she would have felt mean			0
' they expect and enjoy haggling , ' insisted @entity7			0
@entity93 has a restored fort that could have been the setting for @entity111			0
i was half expecting to find @entity112 round the next turret			0
the fortified town of @entity93 , home to ' a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market ' held every friday even better than @entity93 's fort was the one at @entity118 , where a 17th - century sultan reclined with dates , concubines and political worries			1
his reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors			1
and his fortifications had gizmos worthy of @entity129 : false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths , and ' killing holes ' through which boiling - hot date syrup could be poured			1
the beautiful @entity136 room , meanwhile , was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver - lit by night			1
@entity15 's mountains are a purpling grey , and water is precious			1
where the irrigation projects have not yet reached , you see blue water lorries labouring up roads			0
government infrastructure work is everywhere			0
the village of @entity147 , perched on a hill with banana trees and palms , is situated near to @entity88 , @entity15 's highest mountain since 1970 , the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century , yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest			1
although @entity100 tourists are welcomed , women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets ( no short skirts , low - cut tops or bare shoulders )			2
nor would you ever go to @entity15 for a @entity100 stag night — alcohol is not plentiful			0
we spent a night on the country 's tallest mountain , 9,800ft @entity88 , which has a not - so - mini ' @entity89 '			1
our accommodation at the @entity168 was odd — freezing cold , prefab huts with mod - con bathrooms worthy of a @entity172 hotel			2
but true to its name , it had a fine view of the plain below			0
the nearby village of @entity147 was a delight , an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms			1
my wife was so enchanted by one deep - gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home			2
in the desert , we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were @entity195 - style tents , and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies			1
@entity30 explains that market traders in the souks of @entity93 have copped on to the idea of overcharging @entity100 tourists , charging the @entity3 rate of £ 3 for a bag of nuts the opulent @entity206 at @entity208 's @entity207 and @entity209 , @entity73 of @entity15 for supper , the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours			1
gosh , it was cold that night			0
but our children found it all fascinating — and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of @entity218			0
the least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards @entity84 and had a few nights at the opulent ( but pricey ) @entity222			0
great pools , comfortable rooms , but we could have been in @entity225 , complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends			0
we did manage to escape into the city , however , and visit the souk , with its goodly whiff of frankincense , the fish market ( rather different smells there ) and the @entity237 , which was completed in 2001			0
the chandelier in the mosque 's main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs — just think of the electricity bills ! the mosque complex , which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers , is a monument to cultural and national selfconfidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering @entity250 mystique			1
@entity251 ( 01242 854 133 , abercrombiekent.co.uk ) offers eight nights in @entity15 from £ 1,675per adult , based on two sharing			0
children under 12 are an additional £ 1,025pp based on two sharing , including return flights with @entity81 .			0

visitors can camp on the country 's tallest mountain , 9,800ft @entity88
village of @entity265 described as ' an oasis with banana trees and palms '
