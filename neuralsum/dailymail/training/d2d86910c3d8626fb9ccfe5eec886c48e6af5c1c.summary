by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 @entity4 invented six children to fraudulently claim almost £ 43,000 in state benefits a single mother who invented six children in order to falsely claim £ 43,000 in benefits , then helped other women copy her scam , has been jailed for a ‘ flagrant and brazen ’ fraud			1
@entity4 , 42 , cashed in on a loophole which means tax credits are paid out without claimants having to submit a child ’s birth certificate			1
over three years the mother of two claimed for six fictitious children , including twins she said she was looking after for her sister and one on behalf of her teenage daughter			2
not content with that , jobless @entity4 – already a convicted benefits fraudster – began helping other @entity27 mothers to perpetrate the same fraud , receiving a cut of up to £ 700 from each			1
it drew comparisons with the notorious @entity33 from @entity34 ’s controversial series @entity31 – with the crucial difference that @entity33 argued she was helping neighbours make legitimate claims			0
@entity4 ’s scam cost taxpayers more than £ 55,000 in total until it was exposed			1
yesterday she was jailed for 12 months , despite her lawyer asking for leniency because she has a – genuine – four - year - old son			1
three other mothers who took part in the swindle , falsely claiming £ 4,151 , £ 2,956 and £ 2,502 , were given suspended sentences earlier this month			0
@entity33 , the alleged ' star ' of @entity31 last night @entity50 mp @entity49 said : ‘ this is an appalling example of flagrant abuse of the benefits system			0
hard - pressed taxpayers are sick and tired of hearing of such abuse and this case shows exactly why we need sanctions and tough sentences for individuals who break the system			0
’ @entity4 had been given a community sentence for a £ 9,000 benefits fraud in 2008 , but the following year she invented a twin of her then 16 - year - old daughter , @entity66 , and began claiming tax credits in her name			1
over a three - year period , she created fictitious children named @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity69 was told			1
they included twins she claimed to be looking after on behalf of her sister , and a baby she said was her daughter ’s but who was in her care			0
she made £ 42,925 between 2009 and 2012 and wrongly claimed a further £ 2,577 in child benefit payments for @entity66 by failing to declare that she had left full - time education			2
@entity86 of her £ 110,000 semi on a quiet street near @entity89 in @entity90 , yesterday told how the property had been refurbished , apparently using the proceeds of the fraud , including a new patio and wrought - iron gates			2
@entity27 @entity69 heard that @entity4 began abusing the benefit system in 2009 when she contacted the authorities to add additional children to her existing legitimate claim for tax credits for her daughter in 2011 she began advising other mothers on how to follow suit , ‘ claiming a kick - back from the proceeds wrongfully paid out as her reward ’ , said @entity107 , prosecuting			1
mothers already receiving tax credits would give her their passwords and bank details , and she would call the helpline pretending to be them and having recently given birth to twins , the court heard			0
this resulted in a back - dated lump sum being paid into the recipient ’s account followed by further regular payments with no further proof required , said mr @entity107			0
‘ the process of reporting changes of circumstances is designed to be simple for the customer and the system relies very much on the honesty of the person notifying the change , ’ he added			0
after @entity4 admitted five benefit offences , @entity131 , defending , urged judge @entity132 , @entity133 , not to send her to prison			2
but the judge jailed her and the court heard that @entity4 ’s daughter , now 21 , will care for her brother while she serves her 12 - month sentence			1
a spokesman for @entity140 said : ‘ we check all the information provided for a tax credits claim and constantly evolve these checks to ensure they remain effective			0
as this case shows , we do detect fraud and we do stop it			0
’ last year @entity140 admitted 1.4million tax credit claims – or one in five – were being overpaid , with losses through fraud and error put at £ 850million a year .			2

@entity4 *concocted* lies involving twins and *imaginary* babies
she also raked in a further £ 5,000 for herself by helping three other women
42 - year - old has been jailed for 12 months as @entity27 @entity160
