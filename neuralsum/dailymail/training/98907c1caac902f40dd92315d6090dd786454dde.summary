@entity1 captain @entity0 has insisted he is not racist and deeply regrets his tirade towards @entity4 batsman @entity3			1
@entity0 was banned for the final two matches of the @entity6 = @entity7 season - missing the chance to lift the @entity7 trophy - after reportedly calling @entity10 ' during the @entity12 clash at @entity13 last month			2
but it was the @entity15 's investigation into whether there was a racist element to the verbal attack that led to what @entity0 has described as ' the toughest time ' of his career in an interview with the @entity22			0
the incident , during which @entity0 called @entity3 a ' f * * * ing @entity25 ' , led to ' the toughest time ' in his career the @entity1 captain was not originally allowed to celebrate with his team after leading them to the title @entity0 's use of the word ' @entity25 ' - shorthand for a band of overseas players who utilise an obscure employment law to play in @entity15 without restriction - was at the root of the charge , but the @entity15 's case collapsed when @entity3 insisted he did not consider the comments to be racist			1
subsequently , @entity0 has been handed a further two - match ban and ordered to complete an anger management course , but he revealed it was the suggestion he was racist that has hurt him most during the saga			2
' at a time when it should have been one of the happiest times of my career , it 's turned out to be the toughest time , ' he told the newspaper			0
@entity0 says he regrets the outburst but has been hurt by being branded a racist by the @entity15 @entity0 was eventually allowed to celebrate @entity1 's win , but is upset at having the moment spoiled ' i am not a racist , and that tag was what hurt me most throughout the whole process			1
' he added : ' there were times when i did n't want to leave the house after being branded a racist , but my family showed me great support that helped me through			0
' @entity0 's additional ban will mean he misses the curtain - raiser to the @entity71 season when champions @entity1 take on @entity73 in @entity74 next spring and he will also be unavailable for the first county championship fixture			2
the 30 - year - old , who has captained @entity1 since 2009 , is now hoping to put the episode behind him			1
the 30 - year - old has captained his county since 2009 and led them to their first championship in 13 years ' i regret the way in which i reacted that day and i have always prided myself on being a role model to my fellow pros and all young cricketers i coach , ' he said			1
' i 'd like to think that i have always played the game hard but fair , and i always endeavour to play every game to win			0
' i am still immensely proud of what we have achieved this season and i hope the whole situation has n't detracted from @entity1 's success			0
@entity1 were brilliant throughout the whole process , particularly ( chief executive ) @entity95			0

@entity0 missed the end of last season for tirade against @entity3
@entity1 batsman says he regrets the way he reacted that day
but @entity0 insists being branded a racist ' hurt me most '
