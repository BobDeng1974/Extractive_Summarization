by @entity0 a group of @entity3 squatters have been discovered living in a disused public toilet for at least two weeks			1
as many as 15 men were found in the small brick building by a council official who went to examine the property before it goes up for auction			1
the squatters had transformed the toilets in @entity12 , north - west @entity13 , into a home by installing a divan bed in the space where the urinals are - as well as a fridge , microwave and cooker			1
they managed to tap into the public electricity supply and install plug sockets , while they also carpeted over the floor tiles			1
home : around a dozen @entity3 men were found living in this public toilet in @entity12 , north - west @entity13 the group of men were discovered by an officer from @entity30 who was visiting the former toilet , which is about to go on sale with a reserve price of £ 300,000			1
when he arrived the squatters promptly left , but they returned a few days later and the building eventually had to be boarded up to keep them out for good			1
pictures from inside the squat show filthy living conditions , with clothes and rubbish strewn everywhere			2
a makeshift shelf running along the length of the urinals boasts a mouldy laptop and a dvd boxset of @entity48 , as well an @entity50 icon and a small sewing machine			0
a television aerial and clothes can be seen hanging off washing lines and one of the cubicles appears to have been used as a storage cupboard , while they have kept the other as a toilet			2
filth : the counters were covered in the men 's possessions and they had crammed a bed into the urinal space ' at one point we were getting reports that there were up to 15 people coming and going , ' a council spokesman said			1
' we did n't find any passports but found some papers with names suggesting they were @entity3			0
' the situation came to light because one of our officers went to make the property ready for marketing , not because we had received any complaints from residents			2
' local residents and businesses seemed largely unaware that the building had been converted into an impromptu home said			0
pharmacy assistant @entity87 said : ' it 's shocking to think that they are so desperate that they want to live in the toilets			0
but i did n't know anyone was squatting in the building			0
' i have n't heard anything about them - nothing about them causing trouble or being a nuisance			2
' it should n't have been left empty and boarded up so long			2
it should either have been torn down or sold sooner			0
' enterprising : the men tapped into the electricity supply and installed a cooker , fridge and microwave a local newsagent said she had seen people going in and out of the public toilet , but added : ' i did n't realise that they were actually living there			1
' council leader @entity113 said : ' this was a public convenience , but it was not meant to be quite that convenient for the squatters who have evidently turned it into a one - bedroom flat			1
' what this shows is that the pressures of eastern @entity124 migration are rippling out into suburbia			0
' people may be desperate to resort to these measures , but this is a building the council needs to sell to put money into services			0
as it is , the taxpayer is going to be left spending more than a penny to repair the damage done at this site			0
' the building is set to be sold at auction later this month .			0
