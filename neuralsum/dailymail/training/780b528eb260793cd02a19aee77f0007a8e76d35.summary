by @entity0 a greengrocers has re-opened for business almost 100 years after it served its first customers as an exact replica of how it used to be - complete with war - era produce			1
@entity7 transformed her modest front room into a fruit and veg shop in 1916 to earn a few shillings so she could survive while husband @entity12 was fighting in the @entity13			1
the business thrived and the pair served their local community until they retired in the 1930s			2

they are pictured with their children @entity32 and @entity35 now , after the historic building was demolished to make way for a new development , it has been lovingly rebuilt , brick - by - brick , down the road in @entity26 , @entity27			1
the time - warp shop only sells produce that was available at the time - turnips , carrots , beans and potatoes ; apples , pears and strawberries - from wooden crates and wicker baskets			2
just like the original , the shop has no electricity supply - it is lit by gas lights and has no fridges			2
rather than precise digital scales , traditional scales are used			0
any left over goods are turned into pickles , chutneys and jams , just as it would have been back in the early 20th century			2
and staff are dressed in plain period clothing just as @entity12 and @entity7 would have worn			1
the opening of the shop is the culmination of a project by local historians who have rebuilt it in the grounds of an open - air museum in @entity26			1
three generations of the @entity76 - @entity12 ’s grandson @entity77 , 85 , great - grandson @entity78 , 54 , and great - great - granddaughter @entity74 , 22 - officially opened the shop last saturday			1
cherished : the shop , pictured in 1950 , thrived and served the local community until @entity82 and mrs @entity7 retired in the 1930s but was then abandoned and later demolished to make way for a new development re-built : it has been re-built , brick - by - brick , down the road and still only sells seasonal , war - era produce mr @entity20 , 54 , a dentist , said : ' there was a recent article in a local newspaper appealing for information about the @entity7 family and their connections to a greengrocers ’ shop which once stood in @entity98 in the town centre of @entity100			1
' i contacted the @entity102 and told them i was the great - grandson of @entity20 and offered to help			1
i have been charting the family tree over the decades so i got all the information i could together and went to meet the curators			0
' to my complete surprise i found out they had actually built an exact replica of the original shop at the museum			0
they showed me around it and it was like stepping back in time 100 years			0
' it was very exciting finding out about it			0
it is a real legacy for our family			0
it is fascinating to see staff there selling produce just as my great grandfather and great grandmother would have done			0
tribute : @entity12 ( left with his son ) and @entity7 were icons of the community			1
now their grandson @entity77 , 85 ( far right ) , great - grandson @entity78 , 52 , and great - great - granddaughter @entity74 , 22 , ( right , centre left ) pay tribute ' it ’s wonderful that this shop that helped provide for our family 100 years ago is up and running again			1
we live in a completely different world now and it is great to think the greengrocers will help teach future generations about how we used to live			0
' @entity141 , a curator at the @entity102 , added : ' the building has been on site since 1995 but we had n’t done much with it			0
last year we decided to restore the shop to its former glory and began researching its past			0
' we found out from a trade directory from 1916 that it was a greengrocers run by @entity7			2
after a public appeal for information @entity152 got in touch and it was a great surprise to him to find his family ’s shop had been recreated			2
