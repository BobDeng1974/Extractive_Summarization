staying power : mr @entity4 insists that he will not quit despite a round of disappointing results which led to more than 250 @entity4 councillors losing their seats in local elections in @entity21 yet even the party leader acknowledged that the party is at risk of losing every one of its 11 meps when @entity32 election results are declared tonight , putting him under even more pressure to go			1
@entity9 , who is set to fight the @entity35 - held target seat of @entity10 in next may 's general election , said the party was ' not going forward with a clear strategy '			0
the county councillor said the party 's achievements were overshadowed because mr @entity4 ' allowed himself to be portrayed as just another pea out of the same pod ' as @entity43 and @entity44			1
in order to win back support , the party needed to demonstrate it was different , she suggested			0
reservations : mps @entity49 , left , described the @entity4 's local election defeats as ' abysmal ' while @entity52 , right , said he was ' not an enthusiastic fan of @entity4 's leadership ' she declined to say who she would like to see take mr @entity4 's place			1
ms @entity9 is one of more than 250 to have signed up to the online @entity59 campaign which has published an open letter to mr @entity4			1
it says voters have delivered a ' stark message about the party 's performance and direction '			0
' we consider it vital that at the 2015 @entity70 should be led by someone who will receive a fair hearing about our achievements and ambitions for the future , ' it says			0
' it is clear to us that this person is not you , as the loss of so many of our hard - working councillors highlights ' you have fulfilled a range of objectives in @entity85 , but we now believe that progress will be best achieved under a new leader			0
' we therefore ask that you stand down , allowing the membership to select your successor this summer			0
' under existing rules , if mr @entity4 refuses to quit , a leadership contest would be triggered if 75 local party associations formally demand one or a majority of the parliamentary party approves a no confidence motion			1
@entity96 : in thursday 's elections , the @entity4 lost control in @entity99 following gains by @entity101 mp @entity49 - while falling short of calling on mr @entity4 to go - described the local election defeats as ' abysmal ' and said they were ' mostly due to national unpopularity '			1
' the high command is in danger of seeming like generals at the @entity108 - repeatedly sending others over the top while being safely ensconced in @entity111 and claiming the carnage is all somehow sadly inevitable , ' he told the @entity113			0
@entity114 , the candidate in @entity115 , is another to have put her name to the letter			2
in thursday 's elections , the @entity118 took charge of @entity120 - the back yard of energy secretary @entity122 - and the @entity4 lost control in @entity99 following gains by @entity101			1
as the scale of the losses became clear , mr @entity4 said he would ' absolutely not ' resign , and insisted the @entity4 were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition			1
he blamed a wider ' anti-politics mood ' but his party has seen its opinion poll ratings at consistently low levels since joining the @entity35 - led coalition			0
mr @entity4 has said it is ' flamingly obvious ' that being part of the government had damaged the party 's chances			1
mr @entity49 told @entity139 on sunday that the party was to hold a ' root - and - branch look at our current strategy , including how and by whom it is presented '			2
' i canvassed a number of backbench colleagues in the run - up to the elections and two very strong themes emerged			2
new leader ? former mp @entity152 has backed business secretary @entity153 to take over as an interim leader as he has been shown to be independent - minded within the coalition ' there was a widespread view that no matter how much @entity4 spoke there was a section of the electorate that would not give him a fair hearing			1
' but equally , there was a need to avoid any civil war in the party			0
' he said the party appeared to have moved from an aggressive footing to a ' less sustainable and more negative approach of digging in in our constituency trenches '			0
' we need to try to improve the national profile and try not to make @entity4 such an obvious target			2
it 's the elephant in the room and the party ca n't ignore it			0
' a @entity4 spokesman played down the significance of a review being carried out in the coming days - insisting it was standard practice to take stock after elections			1
another mp , @entity52 , said he would consider ' whether any action is needed ' when @entity182 returned on june 4 and said he was ' not an enthusiastic fan of @entity4 's leadership '			2
however , former mp @entity152 has backed business secretary @entity153 to take over as an interim leader as he ' has been shown to be independent - minded within the coalition '			0
she told @entity187 : ' what we need over the next year is somebody to lead the party who is credible , who has questioned the coalition in the past , not seen to be in a love - in with @entity43 and has the confidence of the party			0
' ' we should be making more of a case for what we have done in the coalition and we are not able to do that at the moment while we have @entity4 , as a leader , associated with some of the negative aspects of the coalition - the broken promises			2
' it 's not easy to say this because @entity4 did a stonking job for us at the last election but i do not think he is the right face for the @entity4 at the next election and many others sadly agree			2
' mr cable ' would be a very good choice ' , she said			0
' then we see what we 've got left after the general election - the young turks can fight it out after a sensible period of time , ' she said			0
@entity4 president @entity221 told the programme : ' @entity4 should undoubtedly stay and the @entity4 should stay the course in @entity85			2
' but that does not mean that we dismiss the concerns of the folks who made their views known			0
' unlike the ' spineless ' other leaders , mr @entity4 had been ' the only one with the bottle and the backbone to stand up to @entity96 ' , he said .			1
