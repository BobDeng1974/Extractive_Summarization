’ when asked if she intends to start a revolution , the millionaire and @entity19 replied : ‘ yes , i think so			0
herself a @entity39 graduate with a very impressive resume , she currently works as @entity21 ’s number two in command – right next to its founder , @entity43			1

@entity1 has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self - impose limits			1
the title of her book is derived from a 2010 @entity59 talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back			2
‘ they say , i ’m busy or i want to have a child one day , i could n’t possibly take on any more			0
' or i ’m still learning my current job			0
i ’ve never heard a man say that to me , ’ @entity1 said			2
@entity1 herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook ’s award after she was voted ‘ most likely to succeed			2
’ ‘ i was embarrassed , ’ the mother of two said			0
‘ my entire life i have been told … or i have felt that i should hold back on being too successful , too smart , too – you know – lots of things			0
’ but the coo made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce			1
a woman on the move : @entity1 , 43 , is launching her book today , and is featured on the cover of this week 's @entity84 ‘ there ’s an awful lot we do n’t control			1
i ’m saying that there ’s an awful lot we can control and we can do for ourselves to sit at more tables , raise more hands			0
’ she also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person can make in their lives , choosing a spouse has extreme implications in the workplace too			0

’ @entity1 has most recently been in @entity26 to promote her book			1
in a whirlwind of publicity , she has also been featured in @entity111 and appears on the march 18 cover of @entity84			0
controversy : @entity1 has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said : ' the moment a woman starts thinking about having a child , she does n't raise her hand anymore ' speaking out : @entity21 chief operating officer @entity118 , who has a personal fortune of $ 500million , says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back the @entity21 guru , who was ranked by @entity126 as the tenth most powerful woman in the @entity128 , has been criticized for being out - of - touch with the modern working woman because of her extreme wealth			1

@entity1 told @entity34 in the interview : ' i am not saying everyone has the resources or opportunities i have			1
i am not saying every husband is going to wake up tomorrow , read a book and do his share			2
i 'm saying that women need to own the power that they have , negotiate for raises			0
' counterpoint : @entity147 's buzzworthy @entity146 cover story from last june argued against @entity1 's speeches @entity1 ’s book tour touches on a hot - button topic , and comes to a vastly different conclusion than @entity147 , the former director of policy planning for the @entity152 and author of last year 's zeitgeist piece , ' why women still ca n't have it all			1
' writing in the @entity146 , @entity147 argued that it was difficult to be away from her son when he needed her , and impossible to find a good role model of a successful , happy , well - rested woman who ‘ had it all ’ and deconstructed much of what @entity1 said in her 2011 commencement speech at @entity163 and her @entity59 talk the year before			2
in the book @entity1 writes that the the feminist revolution has ' stalled ' and that women earn 20 per cent less than men over their lifetime if they decide to have children			1

she writes : ‘ imagine that a career is like a marathon ... a marathon where both men and women arrive at the starting line equally fit and trained			0
the men and women run side - by - side			2
the male marathoners are routinely cheered on : ' looking strong ! on your way ! ' for women however , the shouts are : ' you know you do n't have to do this ! ' watch video here			0
