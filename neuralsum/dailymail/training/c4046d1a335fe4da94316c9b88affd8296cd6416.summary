by @entity0 a couple whose daughter died six hours after she was born at a midwife - led birthing unit have today warned of the dangers of giving birth away from a major hospital			1
@entity7 and @entity8 appeared on @entity10 's @entity9 to urge prospective parents to be cautious in the face of the new draft @entity14 guidelines			1
the radical shift in @entity18 policy is set to encourage hundreds of thousands of mothers to give birth in their homes or at stand - alone midwife - led units , away from consultant run labour wards			1
their daughter @entity25 died on march 1 , 2009 , after suffering a rare condition where blood leaks from the foetus into the mother during pregnancy			2
but medics responsible for her care , determined she was suitable to give birth at @entity50 - a rural midwife - led unit - around 40 minutes from the nearest district hospital in @entity54			1
just two hours after she was born , @entity25 's tiny body collapsed and she was flown by air ambulance to @entity57 where she died at 4.05pm the same day			1
an inquest jury at @entity59 unanimously concluded in november 2012 that @entity25 would have survived had she been delivered elsewhere , and the decision by clinicians to treat mrs @entity7 ' pregnancy as low risk contributed to @entity25 's death			1
mrs @entity7 pictured with her daughter @entity25 moments after she was born in march 2009 mrs @entity7 and her husband mr @entity8 , who married in 2011 , said they would urge new parents to ensure they have all the information they need to make the decision about their child 's ' most important moment ' , their birth			1
mrs @entity7 told the show , her pregnancy had been classed as low - risk , leading medics to tell the couple she would give birth at the rural community hospital in @entity50			1
she said she was given no choice , adding : ' when you are pregnant you are terrified of giving birth , you are in the hands of clinicians and you listen to absolutely everything they say			0
' the couple said while they do not want to put people off midwife - led units , which are recommended by the @entity18 for women who have experienced no complications during pregnancy			1
but they stressed it is important women have the right to choose			0
the couple appeared on @entity10 's @entity9 to discuss the new @entity18 draft guidelines revealed this week , which say new mothers should be encouraged to give birth in midwife - led units and second mothers should be urged to have a homebirth a radical shift in @entity18 policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home			1
mothers - to - be will be told that unless there is a high risk of complications they do not need a hospital delivery			2
first - time mothers are to be advised they are just as safe having their baby in a small midwife - led unit as on the labour ward			1
for most of those having their second child , giving birth at home is as safe as hospital – and far more pleasant – say new draft @entity18 guidelines revealed this week			2
currently , 94 per cent of the 730,000 women who go into labour in @entity133 and @entity134 each year give birth in hospital			2
only 2.5 per cent give birth at home with the remainder going to midwife - run centres			1
having a baby at home or in a midwife - led centre is far cheaper than having a hospital birth as women do not need a hospital bed			1
staffing costs in midwifery units are also lower and they tend to rely less on pain relief or other interventions			0
studies have shown a birth at home costs the @entity18 an average of £ 1,066 , compared with £ 1,450 at midwife - led centres and £ 1,631 in hospital			1
previously , @entity18 guidelines said mothers should be free to choose where they gave birth but urged caution over home births for women having their first child			1
women will now be advised to give birth outside hospital as long as their pregnancy is considered low risk and they do not suffer from asthma , diabetes , epilepsy or other chronic health conditions			1
midwife - led units aim to create a more homely environment and there are typically between four and ten beds and water - birth facilities			1
they are either stand - alone centres in the community or attached to hospitals			0
doctors are summoned only in an emergency			0
' i support a woman 's right to choose , when you are given the information to make an informed choice , ' said mrs @entity7			2
' in our case we had no idea what could go wrong , how long it could possibly take to get me or my baby to a centre of care			0
' the @entity197 was the nearest major hospital to @entity50 , 31 miles away			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' when @entity25 was born it was noted she was pale and floppy and her temperature reading was hyperthermic			2
' she was in respiratory distress , unfortunately it went unrecognised			0
' for a prolonged period of time she was suffering oxygen starvation and was brain dead			0
' mr @entity8 said : ' there was only one qualified clinician , one midwife who was alone			2
' the inquest showed she placed @entity25 , who was in a hyperthermic state , into a cold cot and left her alone			0
' his wife added : ' she was on her own , i was in another room and @entity8 had been sent home			0
' when the ambulance came they grabbed her and ran , there were no notes , nothing			0
' they took her to an air ambulance they had called			2
the doctor on board had no notes and tried to stabilise her on the ground for some time before they had to leave			0
' mr @entity8 said he rushed back to the hospital in @entity50 , and got in the car with his wife and parents with no idea which hospital the air ambulance was heading to			1
he said they knew it was a @entity240 hospital and so headed for the city			0
but en route his wife collapsed due to the shock and he had to dial 999			0
mrs @entity7 was taken to a hospital in @entity245 , while he carried on with his parents , desperately calling hospitals in @entity240 to try and locate @entity25			1
minutes later a doctor called him to say he believed he had his daughter , but said all the information he had was her time of birth and her name recorded as @entity7 - that of her mother			2
the couple said it is vital that parents expecting a child consider how far the nearest hospital and consultant - led team is , before agreeing to give birth at a midwife - led centre mr @entity8 said : ' we came to this from the perspective of losing @entity25			1
' it is really important that mothers have the choice , but we would urge them to be on the side of caution for what 's possibly the most important moment in your child 's life - the birth			0
' we go out and we buy the best car seats to cradle them , and the softest linen to wrap them in , to bring them home			0
' but mothers should have the opportunity to make choices that should be informed choices			2
' with that information should come the times it takes to get to a centre of excellence , a consultant - led unit , a surgery theatre if needed and a paediatric ward			2
his wife added : ' ask for it ( the information ) , research it			0
' think long and hard about giving birth in an environment where you are likely to be transferred in ( to hospital )			0
' forty - five per cent of home births are transferred in to a consultant - led unit			1
' your fall back is the ambulance service and we know that is under - funded			0
if you need an ambulance and it does n't come you and your baby could die			0
' after the inquest , @entity310 , head of midwifery and deputy centre chief for the women and children 's centre at @entity315 , said : ' we will now be taking the time to reflect on the jury 's findings			0

@entity7 gave birth to @entity25 at a midwife - led unit at @entity50 in march 2009
@entity25 died six hours later after being rushed by air ambulance to a specialist *neonatal* unit at @entity57 in @entity240
an inquest in 2012 found @entity25 would have survived had she been born elsewhere and that classing mrs @entity7 ' pregnancy as low risk contributed
mrs @entity7 and husband @entity8 today urged expectant couples to make informed choices about where to give birth
it comes after @entity18 *guidance* this week recommended first - time mothers with low risk pregnancy should give birth at midwife - led units
draft @entity14 guidelines encourage more home births for second births
