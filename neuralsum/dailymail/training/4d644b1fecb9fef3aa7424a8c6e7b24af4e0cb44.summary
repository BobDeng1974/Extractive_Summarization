by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:56 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 30 october 2013 when @entity3 and a few of her friends promoted their new @entity7 on @entity8 , they were stunned by the response			1
more than 350 women turned up to join at the church hall they had booked			1
they were totally unprepared for the growing interest in the ‘ @entity20 ’ organisation , which leading members say has been sparked by the popularity of shows such as @entity17 and further helped by the ease of spreading the word on @entity8			1
however , there was room for just 220 inside the church hall in @entity24 , @entity25 – so after having queued in the street for hours to enrol , many found themselves turned away			1
at one point organisers were so overwhelmed by the numbers they considered asking police to help			2
disappointed : 100 women were turned away as the founders of the @entity35 group were forced to cap numbers at 220 new recruits			1
the women braved miserable weather to be in with a chance to join branch president mrs @entity41 , 41 , said : ' i was amazed by the numbers			1
i was slightly worried it might happen and we might need to call the police or something			2
' when people said there was queuing outside we ran to the door and let the first lot of women in and then you could n’t move - and they were still queuing outside			2
' i think the community is part of it , it is a very friendly community and we are trying to make it more so			2
' we had spoken to friends who said they were coming along and knew they would but there were so many more			2
we disappointed a few people , which we did n’t want to do			2
' many women i know do n’t do much for themselves , they do a lot for their kids , families , houses and their work but this is something for them , where they can learn to make cocktails and how to sort out the car or make a curry			0
' @entity8 effect : president @entity3 believes advertising the group on @entity8 led to the surge in interest from new members			1
the group are looking forward to a packed calendar of events stunned : organisers of the new @entity25 group of the @entity81 feared they would have to call the police to manage the crowds , as 350 women rushed to sign up the first seeds of an idea for the new group were sown in august when 14 women responded to ms @entity41 's appeal on @entity8			1
she said : ' there was another meeting in my living room - it was bring your own chair and your own glass and then two - and - a - half months down the line we launched			0
it was a little bit quick			0
' but forget ' @entity20 ' , the new troupe - made up of women aged 20 to 60 - have a packed calender of events , including cocktail making and car maintenance workshops			0
senior members of the @entity81 say interest in the organisation has been boosted by cooking shows , including @entity17 and @entity110			1
national chairman of the @entity81 , @entity111 said she has never heard of such numbers signing up to a single branch ever before in its 98 - year history			1
@entity20 : members of the @entity117 making jam in 1941 - and it 's still popular now a woman gives a fruit bottling demonstration at a wartime @entity117 meeting in @entity122 in 1941 the influx of women at the new branch last thursday comes after two further wi groups started in @entity25 in the last two weeks - adding to the 4,300 members already signed up across the city			2
the iconic organisation was set up in 1915 to harness the spirit of the @entity131 and is best known for jam - making and its anthem @entity134			0
' it ’s fabulous , ' national chairman , @entity111 , said			0
' i do think @entity8 does make a lot of difference as it is a very quick and easy way of spreading the news and then people pass it on			1
' chairwoman of the @entity144 of @entity117 , @entity145 , said when the local @entity148 branch was launched several years ago more than 100 women turned up			1
she said : ' we have started three in the last fortnight , one in @entity151 the week before and one in @entity153 the night before , they saw large numbers but not as many as @entity35			0
' i think it is because women want to meet people in the neighbourhood , it is community and that is the theme at @entity24 , doing things together baking cakes , dress - making and i think television as well have played their part such as @entity17 and @entity110 and things like that			1
and just making friends , it ’s fun			0
' florist mum - of - three @entity169 , 33 , was involved in the @entity81 from the start , having responded to the initial @entity8 message			1
she said : ' it is a great community here with lots of lovely groups , mostly focused around the kids			0
' it is great to meet lots of lovely people but you tend to do things around the kids so this is a nice way to try a few crafts and go out somewhere without the kids			0
' the response was fantastic , it shows there is definitely a need for many more groups in the local area			0
it feels like we are at the beginning of something exciting			0
' i grew up in @entity24 and went to the school there and there were all my old school friends i had n’t seen for years turning up			0
' committee member @entity197 added : ' the reason i wanted to get involved was to meet more ladies in the community and just do something a bit different			0
it is a good mixture of the traditional and something a bit different			0

more than 100 turned away as hopeful new recruits queued for three hours
president @entity3 ' amazed ' at surge in support for her new group
@entity81 's *success* boosted by @entity17 and @entity8
