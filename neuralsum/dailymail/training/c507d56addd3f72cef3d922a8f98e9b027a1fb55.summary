he was taken to @entity26 last thursday after the crash at 8.10pm and remarkably just needed a few stitches to a gash on his head			0
and just 18 hours after his car was hit by the juggernaut mr @entity1 was back on his feet and walking out of the hospital			1
he said there was n't much he could remember about the crash except standing on the passenger side of his @entity14			1
he said : ' i remember standing there and then i was pretty much knocked out straight away , i was thrown down the banking and landed in a hedge			0
' i suppose it is pretty amazing that i did n't break anything , i guess the hedge softened my fall			0
' my bosses have been really good to me and the doctors said it would take six weeks to heal properly but i reckon i 'll be fine in three			0
' his mum , @entity48 , said it was a miracle mr @entity1 escaped with just a bad cut to his head , a sore knee and bruising			1
she said : ' everyone we spoke to who was involved in helping him said it was a miracle he was alive			0
' we are in shock at the moment			0
the thought of what could have been - it 's devastating			2
it sounds dramatic , but i want people who helped him to know we are thankful and know how lucky he was			0
' he was so close to death , yet he is with us			2
somehow , 18 hours after a 42 - tonne lorry crashed into him and his car , he was walking out of the hospital on crutches			1

he got out to look under the bonnet and had walked round to the passenger side of the car when the crash happened			1

he thinks he was unconscious for five or 10 minutes			0
people had seen that someone had been with the car before the crash so they were searching for him			2
he started shouting when he woke up and they found him			0
' they were searching for other bodies because he could not make any sense - he could not tell them if anyone else had been in the car with him			1
' if his girlfriend and her three - year - old girl had been in the car they could have been killed			1
' the whole thing was a wreck - a total write off - the back of the car was in the front seat			1
i think the fact that it was a @entity14 he was driving saved his life			2
