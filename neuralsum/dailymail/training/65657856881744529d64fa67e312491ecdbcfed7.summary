by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 05:52 est , 13 september 2012 not interested : @entity1 was indifferent to space travel - until he realised he could use it for political gain despite rousing speeches in the early @entity7 about his determination to put a man on the moon , @entity5 president @entity1 was initially very hesitant about space travel			1
correspondence between the newly inaugurated @entity1 and vice-president @entity13 in 1961 show that the reason behind the space programme was a chance at political victory over the @entity18 – not exploring the universe			1
during a 1962 meeting with @entity22 , the 45 - year - old president said that he was ‘ not that interested in space '			2
space exploration was @entity1 ’s weakest area during his first few months in office , according to @entity27 , @entity29 's @entity28 correspondent			2
it was the area he was least confident with and records show the young president did not take much interest in educating himself about space , prioritising other matters			2
his own science adviser said that mr @entity1 simply ‘ has n’t thought much about it ’			0
mr @entity1 ’s indifference to space stretched back to his days as a @entity41 senator in the @entity42 , according to the biography @entity1 : history , @entity45 , @entity46			0
during a dinner with @entity48 , an @entity49 professor and aerospace pioneer , @entity1 and his brother @entity51 ‘ ridiculed ’ professor @entity48 ’s pitch about space travel , and ‘ could not be convinced that all rockets were not a waste of money and space navigation even worse ’			1
speech : president @entity1 during his passionate speech about space travel and putting a man on the moon , at @entity63 in 1962 however , when the @entity18 sent the first man into space in 1961 , a mere three months after @entity1 had been sworn in as president , the president began to see the political benefits of exploring space			1
in the wake of the @entity71 , president @entity1 was in need of a political victory , both to show the strength of his government and to demonstrate superiority over the @entity18			1
the answer , it seems , was to beat @entity18 in the race to space			1
as cosmonaut @entity82 - the first human in space - returned to @entity83 in april 1961 , fears began to grow in the @entity5 that the @entity18 were technologically more advanced			2
space run : after the @entity71 and @entity86 @entity82 's safe return to @entity83 , @entity1 , right , asked vice-president @entity13 , left , how soon the @entity5 could send a man to the moon mr @entity1 turned to vice-president @entity13 , and it becomes clear from the letter sent by the president that there was only one reason for his support of the space programme			0
his letter to mr @entity13 from late spring 1961 reads : ‘ do we have a chance of beating the @entity18 by putting a laboratory in space , or by a trip around the @entity103 , or by a rocket to land on the @entity103 , or by a rocket to go to the @entity103 and back with a man ? @entity107 : @entity108 photographed by @entity109 after landing on the moon , six years after @entity1 's death ‘ is there any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win ? ’ not long afterwards , on may 25 , president @entity1 announced the @entity5 ’s new goal of landing a man on the moon in an address to @entity120			1
‘ first , i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the @entity83			0
‘ no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important for the long - range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish			0
’ four months later in a speech at @entity63 , @entity1 said : ‘ the exploration of space will go ahead , whether we join in it or not , and it is one of the great adventures of all time , and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space			0
‘ we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard			0
’ nearly six years after mr @entity1 was assassinated in @entity147 , on july 20 1969 , @entity146 had landed and the following day @entity109 made the ‘ giant leap for mankind ’ and took the first steps on the @entity103 .			0

*enthusiastic* about a chance at political victory , not space travel , and determined not to be *upstaged* by the @entity18
