@entity1 president @entity0 has delivered a considerable snub to the @entity3 by turning down the opportunity to join a televised debate with his three challengers before the election in @entity8 on may 29			1
@entity0 was always expected to refuse the request , put to him in a letter from the @entity3 and @entity11 , for an hour - long debate with prince @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 about their plans for leading @entity1			1
the event would have been hosted by top broadcasters from the two networks and given equal prominence to each candidate			0
@entity1 president @entity0 speaks to journalists after the @entity25 meeting in @entity26 last month @entity1 presidential hopeful @entity14 takes notes during the @entity28 on march 4 but rather than give a courteous answer by letter to the prominent tv stations , @entity0 relayed the curt reply ‘ thanks but no thanks ’ via one of his flunkeys in a telephone call			1
this did n’t impress the @entity3 , who have been @entity1 partners as @entity41 rights - holders since proper live coverage started in 1966			1
@entity0 ’s three challengers replied by letter that they would be happy to participate			2
but the whole project depended on @entity0 and he is not even prepared to outline his reasons for not taking part , let alone have his make - up applied for the tv cameras — in front of which he would have by far the most to lose			2
far better for @entity0 is to fast - track @entity53 funding to @entity55 countries , where he enjoys mass voting support			2
prince @entity13 is pictured during a press conference in central @entity58 last month @entity15 , also going for the @entity1 presidency , poses for a photo in @entity61 earlier this month boxing promoter @entity62 is in positive talks with @entity65 about super bantamweight @entity66 making his second world title defence on terrestrial tv			1
@entity66 ’s win over @entity70 in @entity26 ’s @entity71 last month had far more impact because it was on free - to - air television			2
@entity65 say their plans for screening boxing are on a fight - by - fight basis			1
@entity66 is lifted up by trainer @entity77 after defeating @entity70 in @entity26 last month the @entity78 have caused plenty of angst for the @entity81 by flexing their financial muscle during power battles			2
however the @entity81 , who have the power of veto as the 21st shareholder in the @entity78 , will not object to ceo @entity88 becoming executive chairman and the governance statute changes that will trigger			0
@entity91 , who fund grassroots sport , make no secret that they are hugely influenced by the participation findings of the @entity96 when doling out cash			0
so it ’s difficult to see how swimming , who shed 245,000 participants last year according to the latest aps figures , can avoid having funds diverted from the national governing body when the allocations are announced on thursday			0
@entity106 poses for a photo during his days with @entity108 in april 2009 @entity111 reject ’s @entity110 ton at least one @entity113 cricketer can hold his head high in @entity115 after the humiliating @entity41 exit			1
unheralded 25 - year - old @entity106 , a failed product of the county system with @entity108 , @entity119 and @entity120 , became the first @entity113 to score a century in the @entity121 for 37 years with his 118 during @entity123 ’s win over @entity115			1
@entity106 , plucked from grade cricket after emigrating 18 months ago , made his state debut last month			0
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- @entity126 have conducted a widespread consultation on their policy of funding only sports with @entity132 medal potential and showing zero tolerance to the rest			0
and it ’s understood the outcome will be ‘ business as usual ’ on the road to @entity137 and beyond			0
the only real change will be more flexibility for team sports , where each medal gained involves a lot more personnel			0
@entity145 , a breath of fresh air on the @entity149 board and @entity150 as a former player , has made the surprising decision to switch from @entity154 chief executive to @entity156 rivals @entity155			0
although @entity155 have a wealthier backer in chairman @entity159 , it does n’t seem much of a promotion for the ambitious @entity145			0
@entity161 , due to retire from football at the end of a disappointing season with relegation - bound @entity165 , is expected to be involved in the @entity166 next season as a pundit for @entity169			1
@entity161 will be alongside former @entity171 team - mate @entity170 , with @entity172 lined up to present the coverage			0
@entity161 is expected to be a pundit for @entity169 's coverage of the @entity166 next season			1

@entity1 president @entity0 has turned down a televised debate
the @entity1 presidential election takes place in @entity8 on may 29
@entity62 is in talks with @entity65 over @entity66 's next fight
