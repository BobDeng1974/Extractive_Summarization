if you ’re stuck up a tree , it ’s nice to know you can rely on your big brother to help you down – even if it means standing on his head			1
the lion had climbed into the tree in search of some shade but ended up clinging on after his cheeky brother dragged him down			1
but the joke soon backfired on the bigger brother , who ended up being used as a sturdy platform by the younger sibling			2
he ai n't heavy , he 's my brother : the stranded lion stands on his sibling 's head the two lions , named @entity22 and @entity23 , left onlookers at @entity25 in @entity26 roaring with laughter			1
although they are both related , @entity22 is better known for his pussycat demeanour , while @entity23 has a reputation for being a fearless hunter			0
photographer @entity32 , 40 , was the only person to snap the big cats in action but thankfully the only thing that took a bruising was the lion 's pride			2
@entity32 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , was one of a lucky handful of people who managed to witness the comical moment and said : ' @entity22 had no trouble getting into the tree but was not so confident climbing down until his brother arrived			1
that looks nice and cool ... can i have a turn ? the brother approaches the shady tree spot sting in the tail : the lion 's nap is disturbed when @entity22 is pulled out of the tree by his tail ' it was really funny to watch as @entity22 got himself more and more into trouble			1
' he was hanging from the branch by his front paws and was clearly searching for some solid ground under his back legs , until eventually he found his brother 's head			0
' they are both extremely playful with each other but they have very different personalities			0
' @entity22 is very friendly and very lazy while @entity23 is a great hunter - he always comes back to look for his sleepy brother			0
' @entity75 cubs love to climb but it becomes more difficult as they get bigger and heavier			0
' i 'm not gong anywhere ! determined @entity22 clings on for dear life as @entity23 looks around ... then gets stomped on do n't worry , i 've got you ! eventually @entity22 loses out to the power of grrrr - avity			0

the lion climbed a tree to enjoy some shade at @entity25 in @entity26
its brother decided he *wanted* to have some fun , so pulled him from the tree ... but it did not go quite to plan
