the @entity1 will force @entity2 to abandon planned spending cuts from @entity5 's very first budget if the party holds the balance of power after the election , @entity0 said today			1
the former @entity10 first minister said the @entity1 would hold all ' the power ' if a @entity5 government needed its votes to survive – and even claimed the party 's surge in support showed it had been the real winner of last year 's independence referendum			1
he said the party would demand an end to austerity – with billions of pounds more borrowing and debt – as the price of propping mr @entity2 up in power			1
appearing alongside the former @entity10 first minister on the @entity38 's @entity37 show , ms @entity33 said : ' the thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this @entity44 fills me with absolute horror			1
' the audacity is atonishing			0
there was a wonderful debate in @entity10 , you lost it			2
we are a @entity44 , that is what the people of @entity10 wanted			1
' but mr @entity0 , who is standing to re-enter parliament in the @entity56 constituency , boasted that the party was set to dictate what was happening in @entity59			0
he said it would be ' very good for @entity10 ' if there was a decisive number of @entity63 after may 7 , adding : ' if you hold the balance , then you hold the power , ' he said			1
asked if that meant @entity68 or another @entity5 chancellor would have to negotiate their budget with the @entity1 , he replied : ' yes , any minority government has to negotiate in order to win a majority for its proposal			1
to deny that is to deny reality			0
' if the @entity1 are in these circumstances it will be very good for @entity10 , certainly			1
' @entity32 defence minister @entity33 said mr @entity0 's remarks were ' terrifying '			1
she said : ' the thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this @entity44 fills me with absolute horror ' mr @entity0 mooted an example where he would propose an amendment to @entity70 legislation in order to create a high - speed rail line to @entity95			2
' what would @entity68 do ? ' he asked			0
pressed on what kind of deal was possible with @entity5 , mr @entity0 said : ' the @entity99 have ruled out a coalition but have n't ruled out a confidence and supply arrangement , where you have a set programme ... i think it is more likely to be a vote by vote arrangement			2
' the former @entity1 leader said : ' i think it 's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure			2
' mr @entity0 went on : ' hopefully that decisive bloc of @entity63 will move the @entity99 in a different direction			0
@entity2 has vowed not to form a formal coalition with the @entity1 after the elction ' i think there is lots of people - certainly lots of people in @entity10			1
. but i think people across these islands are pretty fed up with the duopoly at @entity59 and might want to see politics a bit more interesting , where parties have to work for their votes and have to justify things on a vote by vote basis to the people of the country			0
' i think lots of people will find that a much more exciting and productive system of politics			0
' mr @entity0 told @entity137 on @entity138 that mr @entity2 had been ' very foolish ' to rule out a formal coalition with the @entity1			2
the mistake was ' not because it was likely to happen but because he did it under pressure from the @entity144 '			0
' i think it 's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure , ' he added			0
mr @entity0 said he believed @entity10 independence was now ' near inevitable ' , and hinted that a commitment to a new referendum could be included in the @entity1 manifesto for the 2016 elections north of the border			1
' the story is not finished			0
i think the direction is now as near inevitable as anything can be in politics , ' he told the @entity157			0
' i think what has happened is that we have established the gold standard of how you have a process for @entity10 becoming independent			2
' what you have to have is a party or parties have to put it in their manifesto for the @entity10 election , they have to win a majority in that proportional parliament to hold a referendum and then the decision of course lies with the @entity10 people			1
' mr @entity0 also appeared to rule out taking over as leader of the @entity1 's @entity176 in the new parliament			0
' no , @entity178 is leader of the group at @entity59 , ' he said			0
' the @entity1 has a collective approach on these things but the person who calls the ultimate shots is @entity184			0
' @entity5 leader @entity185 said the @entity1 would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by @entity2 as they had already ruled out working with the @entity32 pushed on whether renewing @entity188 was a ' red line ' for the @entity1 that would prevent a deal with @entity5 , mr @entity0 said : ' you could n't have a coalition or a confidence and supply , but a vote by vote is what comes up in the @entity198			1
' @entity5 leader @entity185 said the @entity1 would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by @entity2 as they had already ruled out working with the @entity32			1
and he warned @entity10 that they could not vote @entity1 to get a @entity5 government ' by proxy '			1
@entity0 insisted his successor @entity184 would lead the negotiations with @entity5 after the election ' people are coming more to the understanding that the biggest party gets to form the government , ' mr @entity185 told the @entity38 's @entity209			2
' it is either @entity5 or the @entity32			1
you can not vote for a @entity5 government by proxy ... it is one or the other			0
' asked about polls suggesting @entity5 faces losing dozens of seats to the @entity1 in @entity10 , mr @entity185 admitted his party had not been ' good enough ' over recent years			1
but he argued that the public was ' starting to listen ' to what they had to say			0
' we have got a long way to go , ' he said			0
' if these polls are repeated on election day this will be a bloody , awful showing for the @entity5			2
' but much more important it will be a dreadful day for @entity10 because by accident we would re-elect @entity230 ... ' @entity230 would cling on to power			2
he would be an accidental prime minister			0
' @entity232 , @entity10 conservative chief whip said : ' four weeks before postal ballots go out , @entity0 is taking the votes of people in @entity10 for granted and planning back - room deals with @entity5 from a tv sofa in @entity238			1
even for him , this is stunning arrogance			0
' now he is talking up the prospect of a vote - by - vote deal with @entity5 - one @entity2 still refuses to rule out			0
' that would mean the @entity1 holding a weak @entity99 to ransom on every vote , every day , all with the aim of trying to weaken the @entity44			1
' a year after @entity10 gave a clear and unequivocal no to the @entity1 's separation plans , @entity0 would be back at the heart of @entity59 trying to sow chaos with our future			2

former @entity10 first minister said the @entity1 would hold all ' the power '
he said the @entity1 would force @entity5 to abandon austerity after the election
would mean billions of pounds of extra borrowing for spending *splurge*
@entity32 minister @entity33 said the *threat* to control @entity44 budgets ' terrifying '
