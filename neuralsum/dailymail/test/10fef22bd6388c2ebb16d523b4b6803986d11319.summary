and after making a full recovery , she is now a healthy size 8 and studying graphics at university			0
she has now gained weight to be a size 8 ( right ) at the height of her anorexia , @entity30 would live on just 10 calories a day - or go three days without eating a single thing miss @entity7 said : ' i 'm so relieved that i have managed to maintain a healthy weight after battling anorexia			1
' it did n't matter how many pounds i dropped , i would always see a fat pig when i looked in the mirror			0
' i would ditch my lunch at school and when my mum was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 i was able to disguise my eating habits as she was having treatment in hospital			1
' she admits she would go up to three days without eating a single thing - but remained adamant there was nothing wrong with her			1
' i lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day , i was starving my body so badly that i could n't even think straight , ' she recalled			1
miss @entity7 was forced to drop out of university in 2009 after her eating disorder took control of her life and she struggled to cope with the work load			1
she added : ' i could n't focus on anything but food , my illness was completely out of control and i was getting thinner and thinner by the day			0
' i eventually got a job as a sales assistant , ironically in a chocolate shop but i was so weak and i did n't know how much more my body would take			0
' then in 2011 , she developed a kidney infection , leading doctors to warn she was risking her life by starving her body			0
@entity7 said : ' the doctor told me he could feel all my organs underneath my skin and that i would end up killing myself if my eating did n't improve			1
' i suddenly realised that i needed help and at just 4st 13lbs , i was admitted to an eating disorder ward once my kidney infection cleared up			1
she said : ' i lived on black coffee and tea which is around 10 calories per day , i was starving my body so badly that i could n't even think straight '			1
miss @entity7 is pictured now at a healthy weight it was only when a doctor warned he could feel all of her organs underneath her skin - and that she would end up killing herself if she did n't eat - that she sought help ' i hated having to gain weight and eating the meals they had given me but i knew i needed to be there			1
' this , combined with daily group therapy sessions , saw her begin to make progress - and after four months at the eating disorder clinic , she was allowed home			2
' i was finally in control of my own meals again and could attend the therapy sessions as an outpatient , ' said @entity30			0
despite suffering a relapse one year later she is now back at university and working part - time			0
she said : ' i 'm now studying graphic design at @entity106 in @entity8			2
' i did suffer a relapse , but the therapy sessions gave me the coping skills i needed to get my eating habits back under control			2
' she added : ' my whole family , including my younger sister , @entity114 , were so worried about me when my weight dropped so drastically			0
' it has been a massive relief for everyone that i have been able to get my weight under control and that i 'm a healthy size 8			0
' i know my illness will always be there but i know how to deal with it all now			0
' i hope other girls who read my story are able to gain hope from everything i have achieved			0
' there is always help available and , despite how isolated you feel , things will get better and you can overcome an eating disorder			2
