by @entity0 for anyone who felt awkward as a teenager and desperately wanted to be popular like the ‘ cool kids ’ at school , a new study may seem like poetic justice			1
scientists have found that teenagers who act cool in early adolescence are more likely to experience a range of problems in early adulthood , compared to their geeky peers			2
children who are revered at school , for example , are more likely to have alcohol and drug problems , become involved in crime , and have problems in relationships			1
scientists have found that teenagers who act cool in early adolescence - as portrayed in films such as @entity25 ( pictured ) - are more likely to experience a range of problems in early adulthood , compared to their geeky peers			2
these include alcohol and drug problems , committing crimes , and having problems in relationships researchers recently claimed that ' cool kids ' are just as likely to get bullied as unpopular children - and that the consequences could be greater for them			1
the study found that the bullying of popular children is an ' invisible crime ' as many refuse to acknowledge problems for fear of ruining their standing			0
they also found becoming more popular both increases the risk of getting bullied , and worsens the negative consequences of being victimised			0
the @entity47 , study found that popular children feel they have further to fall			0
the study found that the risk of being bullied increases as adolescents climb their school 's social ladder - up until they approach the very top , when the risk plummets			0
the students at the top , approximately the 5 percent most popular kids in school , sit just above the fray , possibly because their extremely high status puts them out of reach of any rivals			0
according to a decade - long study by researchers at the @entity64 , cool teens who seek out popularity and attention by acting older their age , may not yield the expected benefits			1
such characters are often seen in teen films and are epitomised by @entity71 in @entity72 and by the four central characters in @entity25			0
researchers followed 184 teens from age 13 , when they were in seventh and eighth grades , to age 23			1
along the way they collected information from the teens themselves , as well as from their peers and parents			0
the teenagers attended public school in suburban and urban areas in the south eastern @entity86 , and were from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds			0
teens who were romantically involved at an early age , engaged in delinquent activity , and placed a premium on hanging out with physically attractive peers were thought to be popular by their peers at age 13			1
but over time , this sentiment faded and by 22 , those once - cool teens were rated as being less competent in managing social relationships , by their once geeky peers			1
according to a decade - long study by researchers at the @entity64 , cool teens who seek out popularity and attention by acting older their their age , may not yield the expected benefits			1
such characters are often seen in teen films and are epitomised by @entity71 in @entity72 ( pictured left ) they were also more likely to have had significant problems with alcohol and drugs and to have engaged in criminal activities , according to the study			2
‘ it appears that while so - called cool teens ' behaviour might have been linked to early popularity , over time , these teens needed more and more extreme behaviours to try to appear cool , at least to a subgroup of other teens , ’ @entity110 , a professor of psychology at the @entity64 , explained			2
‘ so they became involved in more serious criminal behaviour and alcohol and drug use as adolescence progressed			0
these previously cool teens appeared less competent - socially and otherwise - than their less cool peers by the time they reached young adulthood			2

a @entity64 study tracked 84 teens from age 13 to 23
teens who were romantically involved at an early age and engaged in delinquent activity were considered to be ' cool ' when aged 13
but , by 22 these ' cool kids ' were rated by peers as being less competent
they were also more likely to have drug problems , and commit crimes
