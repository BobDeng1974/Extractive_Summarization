@entity14 is a rare but serious psychiatric disorder that was first described in 1991			1

the disorder usually begins with a virus that results in the need for consulting a doctor or going to the hospital , even though no substantial cause can be found			0
@entity14 starts slowly , but the child then worsens quickly becoming reluctant to , or not capable of , doing anything for themselves			1
they refuse to accept others caring for them , or helping them eat , and are very depressed and distraught			0
it is not guaranteed that recovery will take place , and it is a lengthy and complex process , involving specialist medical care			0

‘ police have barged in a couple of times thinking we ’re abusing @entity1 because it sounds like she ’s being violently attacked because of all the banging and intense screaming			2
our house is now flagged on the police system so if they get called again they are aware of her condition			0
’ when family members and doctors have visited @entity1 ( pictured before ill ) at home her outbursts have been so violent that frightened neighbours have called the police she added : ‘ we always knew that @entity1 ’s out - of - character behaviour was not her fault			1

‘ she ’s got a very serious illness and we love her just the same in spite of everything			0

she is pictured here before contracting the ear infection dr @entity155 , medical director of @entity156 , said @entity14 was a complex disorder that was not included in the standard psychiatric classification systems			2
he added : ‘ the severity of pervasive refusal disorder varies from child to child			0
‘ one child may simply refuse to go to school as a result of the disorder , while others may refuse to clean , eat or even drink			0
‘ as is seen in this case , obsession and anxiety are common effects of the disorder			0
the child often feels they need control , routine and predictability for safety reasons			0
‘ at its worst the disorder can be life - threatening			0
’ @entity1 's parents are now raising money to get her treatment from a @entity182 - based specialist			2
she is pictured as a young bubbly girl before she became seriously ill with the psychiatric disorder it is not certain whether even treatment in @entity182 would be able to help @entity1 ( pictured before ill )			1
