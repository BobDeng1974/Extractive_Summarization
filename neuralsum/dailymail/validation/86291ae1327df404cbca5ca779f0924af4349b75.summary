@entity0 fell agonisingly short of claiming an astonishing @entity2 title as @entity4 's side ran in seven tries to beat @entity6 on one of the most astonishing days in the history of the @entity9			1
going into the game knowing they needed to win by 26 clear points , @entity4 's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them finish one of the most remarkable matches in @entity19 history broken , but not bowed			2
@entity0 's players were left distraught as the realisation they had finished so near but so far away from winning the title			1
for the fourth year running under @entity24 , his side must settle for second place in the championship but this was a stunning performance that will see them take enormous confidence into the @entity31			0

* @entity118 ratings by @entity120 at @entity19 they have reason to be proud			0
twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately @entity0 finished six points adrift of the total they needed as @entity38 claimed the title for the second season running			1
@entity0 could barely have done any more but were punished for a second - half lapse of discipline which saw @entity68 sin binned for tripping and @entity6 scored two tries			1
' we 're absolutely devastated , ' said man - of - the - match @entity45 , who scored two tries			2
' for all our endeavour , we fell short			0
' @entity38 's crushing victory over @entity135 at @entity56 earlier in the afternoon left @entity0 with a huge mountain to climb			1
@entity0 began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of @entity4 's tenure			2
it was always going to be a huge ask against a @entity144 side that , for all its faults , had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this @entity19 clash			0
suddenly , the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around @entity0 's throat			1
@entity4 had recalled experienced @entity50 lock @entity67 in place of @entity156 and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against @entity135 last saturday			0
@entity78 's @entity50 team - mate @entity66 led his side out on his 50th cap and @entity0 knew they would need a titanic set - piece performance , first and foremost , to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win			2
and from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as @entity0 wheeled their opposing eight enough for @entity169 @entity168 to put extreme pressure on @entity6 scrum half @entity171			1
the @entity173 threw a pass to nowhere with @entity69 breathing down his neck and @entity0 centre @entity59 – @entity0 's find of the tournament – gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back @entity57			1
@entity57 worked the ball to @entity62 who flipped a clever pass inside to @entity45 who pirouetted over the line for a try inside 90 seconds			2
@entity62 added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7 - 0 and @entity0 were away			1
only a missed penalty attempt dampened the crowd 's enthusiasm			0
then , disaster struck as @entity40 fumbled a pass from @entity45 down the right and @entity93 snaffled the ball with only @entity66 covering across and the line at his mercy			0
the @entity6 scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the @entity19 crowd			1
@entity92 missed the conversion but moments later @entity6 went even further ahead when winger @entity91 broke away down the left to score his side 's second try inside a couple of minutes			1
but the left winger can consider himself incredibly fortunate after he brainlessly attempted to run around under the posts only to touch the ball down milliseconds before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line			0
the @entity214 agonised over the decision and eventually , after countless replays , the try was awarded			0
@entity0 's @entity61 goes over for his second try of the match but @entity0 could not find enough points to jump above @entity38 @entity6 's @entity91 scores a controversial try after getting away from @entity45 during the first half @entity91 was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line @entity0 's @entity59 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity6 duo @entity90 ( left ) and @entity94 @entity0 's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another @entity2 title under @entity24 @entity92 's conversion made it 15 - 7 after 17 minutes and suddenly @entity0 's task was even greater than at kick off			1
@entity40 caused a mini fracas when his huge hit on @entity92 angered @entity6 , although referee @entity237 deemed the tackle was fair			0
@entity83 then reduced the deficit to five points with a long - range penalty and @entity92 missed back - to - back penalties to deny @entity6 the chance to pull further ahead			2
now it was @entity0 's turn to get lucky			1
youngs made a searing 40 metre break down the right and fed inside to @entity83 who was tackled short of the line			0
@entity68 dipped for the ball but appeared to knock on in the process before gathering and popping to @entity58 to cross			0
but this time the @entity214 ruled in @entity0 's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off @entity68 's knee			1
@entity62 converted to make it 17 - 15 after 31 minutes			2
in an astonishing game , @entity59 then broke from his own line to make 70 metres before chipping ahead for @entity60			0
the centre lost out to @entity261 but earned a penalty which @entity0 took quickly and @entity45 wriggled over for his side 's third try			1
@entity62 converted to make it 24 - 15 and @entity0 dared to dream again			1
a @entity83 penalty on the stroke of half time left @entity0 27 - 15 in front after a memorable half but @entity271 crossed two minutes into the second half to leave the home side 21 points away from claiming the title			2
seven of those came four minutes later when @entity45 , enjoying his best game in an @entity0 shirt , made a searing break down the right and fed inside for @entity83 to canter over for his side 's fourth try			1
@entity62 converted his own try to make it 34 - 22			0
@entity40 is grabbed by his shirt during the first half as @entity6 's players let their frustrations boil over @entity62 slides on to his right side as he scores @entity0 's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half @entity292 ' @entity61 finishes off another flowing @entity0 move to score his country 's fifth try against @entity6 @entity296 's @entity58 scores @entity0 's second try of the match during a frantic opening period at @entity19 @entity6 's @entity171 responded to @entity45 ' early try with one of his own after a brilliant 40 - yard dash @entity71 drives forward late on during @entity0 's desperate search for points at @entity19 @entity65 conceded a needless penalty which replacement @entity105 kicked			1
it was @entity65 's last act as he was replaced by @entity309 on 52 minutes			0
@entity0 struck again when @entity61 crossed after more good work from @entity45 and @entity83 's conversion made it 41 - 25 after 53 minutes			1
but @entity0 's delight was tempered when @entity68 was sent to the sin bin for a blatant trip on @entity92			2
with @entity68 off the pitch , @entity6 broke again and @entity91 made a searing run down the left			2
@entity57 looked to have stopped him but the winger flicked a clever pass to the supporting @entity94 and the prop scored			0
@entity105 missed the conversion leaving the deficit at 11 points			0
@entity71 was introduced to the fray at full back on 61 minutes with @entity58 going off and @entity57 moving to the wing			0
within seconds @entity0 scored again when @entity69 drove over and @entity83 converted , leaving @entity0 18 points in front			0
it was utterly astonishing stuff			0
@entity6 scored their fifth try when replacement @entity107 drove over from a line out but @entity105 missed again to leave the score 48 - 35			2
@entity68 was replaced by @entity334 as @entity0 began to sense their title hopes were slipping away			0
but in keeping with this incredible game , @entity61 crossed for his second try after clever work by @entity62 , who converted , to leave @entity0 needing six more points with four minutes left			1
@entity0 head coach @entity4 ( centre ) watches his players in action from the stands at @entity19 @entity45 caps a brilliant first - half performance with his second try of the match and @entity0 's third @entity0 's @entity40 gets caught up in a scuffle with four @entity6 players as tempers flare during the first half captain @entity32 bursts forward as @entity0 chase a big win to beat @entity38 to the @entity2 title @entity0 's players , including @entity358 ( right ) , look dejected after conceding a crucial try to @entity6 on home soil			1

@entity45 scored an early try to give @entity0 hope of winning the @entity2 title @entity19
@entity6 *battled* back with tries from @entity171 and @entity91
further tries from @entity58 and @entity45 helped put @entity0 in control at the break
@entity62 and @entity61 both went over in the second half to extend @entity0 's advantage
@entity38 's 40 - 10 victory over @entity135 earlier in the day enough to secure the @entity2 trophy
