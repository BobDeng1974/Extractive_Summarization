@entity7 researchers believe that the canines hitched a ride from @entity4 to the @entity10 with ancient humans			2
@entity13 dogs that were once thought to be extinct , have been found to be thriving , according to the @entity14 in @entity15			0
the arrival of @entity17 in the @entity10 has generally been assumed to have led to the extinction of indigenous dog breeds , but a comprehensive genetic study has found that the original population of native @entity2 dogs has been almost completely preserved			1
generic analysis of hundreds of @entity2 dog breeds including chihuahuas , sled dogs and hairless @entity28 dogs has revealed that their ancient roots trace back to @entity4			1
@entity31 , a researcher in evolutionary genetics at the institute , said that 30 per cent or less of native @entity2 dog breeds @entity35 comes from @entity17 , suggesting that they traveled to the @entity10 with the ancient humans who established pre-columbian civilisations			1
' our results confirm that @entity2 dogs are a remaining part of the indigenous @entity2 culture , which underscores the importance of preserving these populations , ' he said			0
most researchers believe that the first @entity2 setters brought dogs with them across the @entity49 around 10,000 years ago			0
@entity17 colonisers also brought their own dog breeds to the @entity10 - as well as a cocktail of diseases in the 16th century			2
to trace the roots of @entity2 dog breeds , dr @entity31 's research group compared mitochondrial dna from @entity4 and @entity17 dogs , ancient @entity2 archaeological samples , and @entity2 dog breeds , including @entity3 , @entity28 hairless dogs and @entity63 sled dogs ( pictured ) dr @entity31 said : ' many populations were wiped out and the culture disappeared with them , so there was nobody to take care of the dogs			1
' many scientists consequently thought that most @entity2 dog breeds shared most of their dna with @entity17 breeds			2
to trace the roots of @entity2 dog breeds , dr @entity31 's research group , in cooperation with colleagues in @entity76 , compared dna from @entity4 and @entity17 dogs , ancient @entity2 archaeological samples , and @entity2 dog breeds , including @entity3 , @entity28 hairless dogs and @entity63 sled dogs			1
they collected cheek swabs from 347 kennel club pure breeds from the @entity10 , including @entity3 , @entity28 hairless dog and @entity82 malamutes and then compared their dna with 1,872 sampled from dogs in @entity4 and @entity17			2
the research , which was published in the journal @entity86 , found that most of the @entity2 dogs had ancestry that can be traced to @entity4			0
generic analysis of hundreds of @entity2 dog breeds including hairless @entity28 dogs ( pictured ) has revealed that their ancient roots trace back to @entity4			1
@entity31 , a researcher in evolutionary genetics , said that 30 per cent or less of native @entity2 dog breeds @entity35 comes from @entity17 , suggesting that they traveled to the @entity10 with the ancient humans who established pre-columbian civilisations ' it was especially exciting to find that the @entity101 breed , @entity3 , shared a @entity35 type uniquely with @entity101 pre-columbian samples , ' he said			1
' this gives conclusive evidence for the @entity101 ancestry of the @entity3			0
' the team also tested 19 stray dogs from the @entity109 and @entity110			0
dr @entity31 believes that the data also suggests that the stray dogs carry genetic markers from @entity4 , not @entity17			0
' most people thought they were just runaway @entity17 dogs , ' dr @entity31 told @entity116			0
the findings support prior studies which found that @entity120 dogs did n't have much @entity17 dna .			0

hundreds of @entity2 dog breeds including the @entity3 originally come from @entity4 , say @entity7 scientists
30 *%* or less of native @entity2 dog breeds @entity35 comes from @entity17 , suggesting that they traveled to the @entity10 with the ancient humans
the arrival of @entity17 in the @entity10 in the 16th century was assumed to have led to the extinction of indigenous dog breeds
but study found the original population of native @entity2 dogs survived
