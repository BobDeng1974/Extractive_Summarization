@entity0 , a @entity1 businessman has made £ 86million in a day after selling off part of his ' white goods ' website an entrepreneur who set up his business for a £ 1 bet took home £ 86million in a single day after its stockmarket debut			1
@entity10 left school without any qualifications and earned the nickname the ‘ @entity16 ’ after creating household appliance website @entity15 14 years ago			1
after the @entity1 - based business was floated on the @entity20 on wednesday , its value soared to a staggering £ 1.6billion			1
he went home with £ 86million after cashing in 10 per cent of his near 40 per cent stake in the company			1
the value of shares in his remaining 28.6 per cent stake rocketed by £ 113million to around £ 458million – making the 40 - year - old the equivalent of nearly £ 3,500 a second during the nine hours of trading			1
the total value of the company is now only just smaller than rival @entity35 , which makes around 15 times more in annual profits			2
mr @entity10 , a married father of five , started @entity15 after a bet made in a pub when he worked selling kitchen appliances for a distribution warehouse			1
‘ like all the best businesses , it started in the pub , ’ he told @entity41			2
‘ it was @entity45 and i was having a drink with @entity47 [ of parent company @entity48 ]			2
he bet me a pound i would n’t do it			2
’ mr @entity10 said he had not heard of the internet at the time , but he used his knowledge of his sector to assemble a database while mr @entity47 – who had internet experience – built the website			1
he realised the long supply chain for white goods such as washing machines , fridges and cookers was adding needless costs for customers , so he cut out the middlemen to keep his prices low			1
success story : @entity15 smashed expectations for its stock market debut with a 33 per cent rise that increased the worth of mr @entity10 by £ 113million in less than nine hours of trading a recent @entity72 television advert			1
mr @entity10 also says the key to his success is the company 's customer service and his approach towards his staff the rise of internet sites and the tech industry in general , created a bubble which is generally defined as the period of investment and speculation in @entity87 firms that occurred between 1995 and 2001			1
a major growth in internet users during this time led to many @entity87 start - ups being born in the mid to late 1990s			0
many of these companies engaged in unusual and daring business practices with the hopes of dominating the market as well as engaging in a policy of growth over profit			2
at the peak of the dot - com bubble in 1999 , it was said that a new millionaire was created every 60 seconds in @entity104			0
but many argue that the dotcom boom and bust was a case of too much too fast			0
on 10 march 2000 , the @entity110 index of leading technology shares spiked , bursting the @entity113 bubble			0
investors soon realised that the dot - com dream had devolved into a classic speculative bubble			0
they were left counting their losses as panic selling ensued as the stock market ’s value plunged			1
companies such as @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 went from being leaders of a revolution to the losers			0
survivors such as @entity130 , were left desperately trying to stay afloat			2
he said : ‘ when we started it was all done on dial - up internet			0
you ’d refresh the page , go and make a cup of tea and it would have loaded			0
' there had to be a very good reason for you to do the 110 - metre hurdles to get on the site – and that was price			0
‘ it was 25 per cent cheaper than @entity147 or @entity148			2
’ @entity15 – formerly @entity149 – sells goods directly via its website and also for high street chains including @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			1
it is the @entity160 ’s largest online domestic appliance retailer , with a 24 per cent share of the @entity164 the key to success is being ‘ fanatical about service ’ and having a ‘ fun working culture ’ , said mr @entity10			1
his 1,000 employees are given access to gym membership and free chocolates and crisps			0
he claims he spent £ 50,000 on crisps last year			0
‘ we make more money the less we worry about making money , ’ he said			0
the company plans to use funds from the float to expand in @entity179 , starting in @entity180			0
however , analysts have warned that the valuation of @entity15 at more than five times its annual sales of £ 275million could lead to a crash similar to the dotcom bubble , when technology companies saw huge leaps in value in the late 1990s before plummeting in 2001			1
several other retail chains are expected to float this year , including @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity158 and @entity193			0
the share price rise means his personal fortune increased by nearly £ 3,700 for every second of share trading			0
