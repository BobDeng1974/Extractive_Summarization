by @entity0 in case you missed this among the millions of words recently devoted to a certain deceased @entity6 , we ought to point out the full range of his all - encompassing brilliance			1
as well as his driving prowess , @entity10 designed the @entity12 , ran up @entity13 in his bare feet , cured cancer , split the atom and wrote @entity17 off the page			2
excuse the sarcasm , but there has been a danger that hyperbole – admittedly among some fabulous and balanced reminiscences – has attended the 20th anniversary of the great racer ’s death			2
hyperbole : while tragic , @entity28 's @entity10 's death was not necessarily the darkest day in @entity29 paying respect : fans from around the world visit @entity10 's grave in @entity6 on may 1 never forget : 16 people were killed when @entity36 's @entity35 careered off the track at @entity38 , 1961 one story i read described @entity10 ’s fatal accident at @entity42 as @entity29 ’s darkest day			1
are we really sure about that ? we should remember the hot afternoon of september 10 , 1961 , when 16 people died at the @entity47 @entity46 at @entity38			1
@entity48 was trying to re-pass the @entity35 of @entity49 on the second lap. ‘ my front wheels were almost level with his back wheels as he started to brake , ’ @entity48 recalled			1
‘ suddenly he began to pull over towards me and he ran right into the side of me			0
‘ i honestly do n’t think @entity58 realised i was there			0
i am sure that when he passed me earlier , he had decided his was the faster car and i would be left behind			0
’ the collision catapulted the @entity35 into the crowd			1
@entity63 was slung out of the cockpit			0
he and 11 spectators died at the scene and four others perished later from the injuries they suffered			2
in all , 49 drivers have died in a @entity29 car , often at the rate of more than one a month during the @entity72 and @entity73			1
the fact the scale of commemoration for one man , the dazzling @entity10 , eclipses all the rest tells us something about a natural human inclination to fete icons , especially those who died young			1
it is , for example , easier to say he was mystical when he was cut off in his prime			0
it also underlines the power of live tv to accentuate an event ’s importance and amplify the memory			0
it may also reflect a modern tendency to involve ourselves publicly in emotional outpourings			0
@entity97 , the 1972 and 1974 world champion , raises an interesting point			1
‘ it is my opinion that , had @entity28 walked uninjured from his @entity42 1994 accident , he would have won the world championship for @entity104 in all three of those years – 1994 , 1995 and 1996 – which would have given him a career total of six world championships to @entity108 ’s five			0
blond ambition : would @entity10 have won the 1997 @entity110 instead of @entity111 ? ‘ indeed , he may even also have won the world championship for @entity104 in 1997 , at 37 , instead of @entity111 , raising his world championship tally to seven			1
’ @entity10 ’s last team principal , @entity115 ( now sir @entity104 , told a @entity6 newspaper this week that his driver would have gone on to rule his homeland			1
‘ i believe that he had politics among his plans and , if he had followed that path , he would have been on his way to becoming president of @entity6 , ’ he said			1
politics position : sir @entity125 believed the @entity6 had the power to become president of @entity6 perhaps , but @entity10 ’s manager @entity127 told me that he though this highly unlikely			1
‘ @entity28 thought he could do far more to help @entity6 from outside politics , ’ he said			2
a coda to this week ’s pictures showing players at @entity135 , the football club @entity10 supported , wearing replica yellow , green and black helmets in his honour			2
the debt owed to @entity10 by @entity6 ’s football fans is greater than many know			1
for in the early spring of the year he died , @entity10 acted as peacemaker between the nation ’s two star strikers , @entity145 and @entity146			1
a head for the occasion : @entity135 players donned yellow helmets in respect for their fallen hero at the prompting of @entity153 , @entity10 spoke to @entity145 and @entity146 and banged their heads together			1
from barely being able to bear the sight of each other , let alone , pass to one another , they formed a deadly strike partnership that won @entity6 the 1994 @entity160			2
five people were sentenced this week to five years in jail for plotting to detonate a bomb during the 2013 grand prix			0
i record this as a supporter of the moderate element among the ruling elite and one who is , therefore , unable to view all the anti-government protestors as freedom - fighters			0
having a blast : five people were sentenced for plotting to explode a device at the @entity162 @entity46 will this attempt to blow up innocent people from around the world – an enterprise which laughably included a woman using a pillow to pretend she was pregnant – lead the protestors ’ apologists in the western media to admit there are terrorists among the anti-government faction ? the smaller teams – @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 – want to ‘ level the playing field ’			2
they believe this can be achieved by receiving more money from the sport ’s pot and a universal cap on spending			0
i have sympathy with them up to a point			0
lost cause : @entity208 has questioned the wisdom in trying to help @entity29 's smaller teams but here is @entity208 ’s view , as quoted in @entity214 ’s biography @entity213			2
‘ i have tried to help struggling teams over the years , ’ he says			0
‘ but it ’s like somebody drowning			0
you throw them a lifebelt , then when they get to the shore , they say , “ you idiot , you hit me on the head with the lifebelt			0
” ’ good luck with your ongoing discussions , boys .			0
