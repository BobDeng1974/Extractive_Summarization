@entity0 was at crisis point last night as @entity3 riot police prepared to raze a camp of @entity6 migrants desperate to make their way to @entity8			1
police vans patrolled the town ahead of the imminent crackdown as a court deadline for migrants to leave the illegal camp known as @entity15 expired			1
it comes as the mayor of @entity0 called for a new @entity19 - style accommodation centre to be built			1
the destruction of the camp by the @entity3 is imminent makeshift : huts erected near @entity0 to house some of the migrants at the site on the edge of a busy road used by lorries heading to the @entity36 ferry terminal the original was closed in 2002 after triggering a @entity8 immigration crisis			1
last night , tensions at the camp were at breaking point as water supplies were cut off and gendarmes prepared to move in to clear the 1,000 migrants living there			1
numbers have swollen in recent weeks as more and more people from @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 make their way to the already crowded settlement and the surrounding countryside			0
but aid workers last night criticised the planned raids , insisting that closing the camp would not deal with the problem if no alternative solution was proposed			0
the @entity15 camp is situated on the edge of a busy road used by lorries heading to the cross-channel ferry terminal on land used by a factory for non-toxic waste disposal			1
the migrants , who are mostly young men in their 20s , started camping out about three months ago			1
in recent weeks their numbers have increased			0
the original jungle , which was razed in 2009 , housed almost 800 @entity70 and @entity72 @entity71 escaping war and persecution			0
@entity75 up : a @entity77 man gives his friend a shave in a squat at a former recycling factory , close to the camp in @entity0 basic : @entity48 men cook eggs together outside their shelter at an illegal @entity0 camp , known as ' @entity15 ' but the large majority of the latest wave of migrants come from @entity48 in east @entity23 with others from neighbouring @entity49 and nearby @entity50			1
officially , there are 500 migrants at the illegal encampment , but numbers are more like 1,000 say observers			2
last monday , a court in @entity0 gave the migrants seven days to quit – a deadline which expires this morning			1
a pipe the migrants cut holes in to use as a water supply has also been cut off and they are now forced to rely on mineral water brought by aid workers			2
authorities in @entity0 claim they are unable to deal with the huge numbers at the camp			2
in an interview with a @entity3 newspaper last week , the mayor said the centre was needed to relieve pressure on the police			2
@entity115 has previously called for the border to be moved to @entity117 rather than @entity0 so @entity8 would have to deal with the migration			2
she has also called on @entity8 to take responsibility for the migrants and claims that they are attracted by our generous benefits system			0
‘ the economic development of @entity0 is affected by the presence of migrants at the port and in all other zones , ’ she said			0
waiting game : how the @entity131 reported the migrant queue at @entity0 on saturday the original @entity134 camp at @entity19 , which was home to 2,000 migrants , was shut down in 2002			1
after the closure , @entity8 accepted hundreds of migrants in a deal with the @entity3 government but others were forced to move to a makeshift camp which became known as @entity143			1
it was razed in 2009 and , since then , the mostly @entity70 and @entity72 @entity71 have had to occupy squats in the town and camps near the ferry terminal			0
in recent months , the @entity3 government has adopted a tough stance , razing camps and throwing migrants on to the street			0
but an increasing number of @entity6 arrivals who have flocked to the @entity15 camp have caused tensions to rise again			0
there are also thought to be thousands living in makeshift camps in the @entity3 countryside , with settlements having sprung up as far away as the @entity162 border			0
last night , aid workers insisted that police raids would not deal with the problem			0
@entity166 , of the charity @entity167 , which has been feeding the migrants , said : ‘ it ’s intolerable that these expulsions are being carried out without an alternative being proposed			0
