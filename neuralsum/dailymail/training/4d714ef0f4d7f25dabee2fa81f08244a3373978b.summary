by @entity0 immigrants should be allowed to move their extended families to the @entity4 more easily , the @entity1 will say			1
they are to propose that rules should be changed so that it is less difficult for the spouses and elderly grandparents of migrants to move to @entity4			1
the plan to water down immigration rules will be unveiled at the @entity1 ’ current spring conference in @entity13			1
border control at @entity15 : a new proposal by the @entity1 would make it easier for migrants to bring their spouses and grandparents to live with them in the @entity4 activists have criticised the government ’s recent decision to raise the earning threshold from £ 18,600 to £ 22,400 before a migrant can bring their husband or wife to the @entity4 , saying nearly half the population would not meet this criteria			1
other proposals include allowing ageing relatives to join their migrant children in the @entity4 for up to two years through a new grandparent ‘ super visa ’			2
the party says the policy could benefit wealthier immigrants , who would pay a health levy before their parents could join them to cover the increased health and social costs to @entity4			1
the @entity1 ’ policy paper on migration says : ‘ our current system does not allow foreign grandparents to visit their families for an extended period			1
countries such as @entity50 have introduced an extended tourist visa for these circumstances			0
‘ allowing elderly relatives who can be adequately supported to visit enables them to spend time with their families , and makes @entity4 a more attractive place to settle for those highly skilled and wealthy migrants who benefit our economy			1
’ ' migrants have enriched @entity4 ' : @entity1 , led by mp sir @entity60 , will also discuss removing foreign students from immigration targets asylum seekers who have been in @entity4 for more than six months would be given the right to work , it adds			1
foreign students who graduate in science , maths , engineering or technology would also be allowed to stay and work for three years after completing their course			0
the suggestion will spark fears that more migrants would compete with @entity4 graduates already struggling to find jobs in a tight market			1
the @entity1 ’ plans fly in the face of public concern over escalating levels of immigration , which jumped by 60,000 to 220,000 last year			2
conservative mp @entity83 said : ‘ this once again shows the @entity1 are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people across the country			2
since 2010 the @entity89 have taken tough measures to reverse @entity92 ’s decade of uncontrolled mass immigration and take back control of our borders			0
‘ now the @entity1 want to re-open the door to uncontrolled immigration			2
’ @entity1 , led by mp sir @entity60 , will also discuss removing foreign students from overall immigration targets			2
however , the party also wants all migrants to learn @entity103 , and for exit controls to be introduced at borders to monitor the numbers leaving the @entity4			1
in its policy motion , sir @entity60 writes : ‘ for generations , migrants have enriched @entity4 ’s culture , language and society and brought innovation , economic growth and increased prosperity for the whole country			1
’ @entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , recently urged his party to woo the voters of @entity124 migrants ahead of the @entity126 elections			0
@entity124 citizens can vote in the @entity4 in the @entity126 and local elections			2

government - approved porn filters would stop adults accessing ‘ educational ’ and legitimate websites , the @entity1 have claimed			0

major internet service providers have agreed that families should have to ‘ opt - in ’ to being able to access hardcore websites at home			0
but @entity1 activists will be urged to back a motion critical of the filters at their conference tomorrow			1
a policy motion on a @entity152 , moved by party president @entity153 , said filters will give parents ‘ a false sense of security ’			0
mr @entity153 first floated the idea of overturning the porn filters in january			0
child safety experts and mps called the move ‘ irresponsible ’ , but mr @entity153 insisted filters were ‘ misconceived , ineffective and illiberal ’			0
he warned that ‘ essential sites ’ on gay rights would be blocked , adding : ‘ if the prime minister wanted to protect children from inappropriate material , he ’d ensure they had access to good sexual health and relationship education			0
