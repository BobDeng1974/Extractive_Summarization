by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 16 october 2013 this morning i woke up alone again , as i do every morning			1
i nipped down to the kitchen to make a plate of hot buttered toast and brought it back to bed , where i switched on the radio , lay back and tucked in , happily scattering crumbs all over the sheets			0
my husband @entity10 and i had n't had an argument , nor is our sex life a thing of the past			1
ever since my husband and i decided to sleep in separate bedrooms five years ago , our marriage has been happier and more fulfilling than ever			1
' best thing i ever did ' : @entity0 is highly pleased with the restorative effects sleeping in a separate bedroom to her husband has had as i listened to @entity10 's footsteps in the hallway , i smiled mischievously as i recalled our wonderful ' date ' in his bedroom yesterday evening , which ended with a kiss goodnight before i tiptoed back to my own boudoir			1
i 've always believed that deciding to sleep alone was the best thing i ever did			1
and this week i learned that i am in some very good royal company			1
in an interview , princess @entity31 revealed that she and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms so they are ' fresher ' for each other			1
since they 've been married for 35 years , they 're clearly doing something right			0
sharing a marital bed is a peculiarly @entity43 thing			0
continentals are far less keen , and @entity46 's @entity45 says 60 per cent of new homes are likely to have dual master bedrooms by 2015			1
so why do it ? well , please understand , i love my husband dearly and the physical attraction between us remains as strong as the day we met			1
but between his snoring and my fidgeting , we just could not get along while we were sharing a duvet			0
@entity10 and i met in 2001 when i was a political correspondent for @entity57 and he worked at the @entity58			0
reinvigorated relationship : @entity0 , pictured here with @entity10 at their wedding , thinks their marriage is happier and more fulfilling than ever although he 's 23 years older than me , i fell for him instantly			1
born in @entity66 , he joined the @entity67 at 17 , flew all over the world and fought in two wars - a definite @entity70 , with dark skin , a deep voice and one infuriating habit			2
like 40 per cent of the men in this country , @entity10 snores - very loudly , every night , without fail			1
only last week , a survey revealed that more than half of all couples find snoring the most annoying habit in bed , and one in ten of us would rather sleep with a pet than our partner			2
for me , sleepless nights became a fact of life			0
but @entity10 was so lovely in every other way that i felt compelled to try to turn a deaf ear to a habit he could n't really help			0
this went on for four years until 2005 when @entity10 and i separated			0
he already had three children from his first marriage and , at 57 , was adamant he did n't want to start another family			0
i desperately wanted a child , so we split			0
we were apart for just over one miserable year before @entity10 managed to woo me back with the promise that we would marry and start a family			0
i was delighted - but i did n't feel the same way about his snoring			2
our first few weeks back together were heaven by day , hell - on - earth by night			1
' night after glorious night , i go to sleep and stay asleep			1
' ear plugs , anti-snoring sprays and nasal strips made zero impact			0
so i made @entity10 consult his doctor , who told him that his sonorous habit was thanks to some boxing he had done as a young man that had left him with a deviated septum			2
on the basis that it would be painful and might not even work , he firmly declined the suggested surgery - and my thoughts turned murderous			2
on a short break to @entity120 soon afterwards , things became so bad that i woke @entity10 and yelled at him : ' if you do n't stop snoring , i am going to punch you really , really hard			0
please go and sleep in the bathroom			2
' @entity10 argued that since i was the only person affected , i was the one who should sleep in the bathroom			2
and so it was that i took myself off to a cold , tiled floor , next to a dripping tap , too exhausted to fight any longer			0
once we got home , i just told @entity10 straight : ' i want to sleep in the spare room			1
' much to my amazement , he greeted the idea warmly			0
' thank goodness for that ! ' he said			0
' i had been trying to think of a way to tell you that your fidgeting and getting up to the loo so many times in the night is driving me insane			2
' good night 's sleep : now @entity0 does n't have to be pestered by @entity10 's annoying nocturnal habits and so , five years ago , i moved into the spare room			1
i go to bed early with a hot - water bottle ( even in summer , as i have the coldest feet ) and read a book			2
i eat chocolate and crisps in bed and get crumbs everywhere - a habit @entity10 ca n't stand			2
night after glorious night , i go to sleep and stay asleep			1
by contrast @entity10 goes to bed very late and watches television with the windows open , even in winter			0
friends say we 're missing out on those spontaneous moments of intimacy and early - morning cuddles			2
but , in reality , people wake up with morning breath and flatulence , not in a romantic embrace			0
intimacy may feel like it 's ' on tap ' when you share the same bed , but in my experience , couples who know they can do it any time actually end up doing it very little			0
but when you have separate beds , you make time for each other out of desire , not out of habit			0
after our son , @entity178 , was born in september 2012 , he slept in my room because i was breastfeeding			0
now , each night @entity10 and i take turns to have the baby monitor in our room and get up if he wakes			1
since he has slept 11 hours a night since he was six months old , that 's never been an issue			1
in fact , our sleeping arrangements are so stress - free all round , that i have been recommending it as a foolproof way of reinvigorating a relationship			1
after all , there 's not much that ca n't be improved by the restorative power of a really good night 's sleep .			1

@entity0 was unable to sleep because of her husband 's deafening snore
@entity200 up , she decided to try out the spare room - and she never left !
sleeping alone means she gets a good night 's sleep
but it also means her relationship with her husband has been reinvigorated
