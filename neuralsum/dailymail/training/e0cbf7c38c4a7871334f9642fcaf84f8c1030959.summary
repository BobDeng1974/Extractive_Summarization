they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder , but scientists believe it may be possible to prove whether a lady , or indeed a man , is foxy or not			0
researchers have discovered that what makes for a beautiful face in a fox , is similar to the features of an attractive human			1
the study found that features seen in farmed foxes - such as flat faces and smaller jaws , as well as a large space between the height of the cranium and face - are the same features that humans find desirable			1
a study has found that features seen in specially bred foxes - such as flat faces and smaller jaws , as well as a large space between the height of the cranium and face - are the same features that humans find beautiful the research , by the @entity29 , also discovered that the presence or absence of such desirable features alters parents ’ treatment towards their offspring			1
it has long been known that the bone structure of people ’s faces determines their beauty and marks them out as a suitable mate			0
however , scientists are interested in whether the shapes of faces relate to other desirable attributes in a mate , such as fertility , social status and health and now they think a friendly looking face might be an important signifier of good character			2
correlations between some of these attributes and beauty have been established , but scientists have said that as people live closely together , temperament and a friendly outlook are important characteristics in a partner too			2
the ugly face of a cartoon witch typically has a small forehead , a pointed face and a hard jaw with an unfriendly expression biological anthropologist @entity70 told @entity71 that a suitable experiment had been performed on foxes five decades ago that answers some of the questions			1
in 1959 , @entity76 , tried to breed tamer silver foxes , which could be more easily handled by farmers in the fur trade in @entity80			1
the geneticist found the selective breeding process , with focused on breeding the friendliest animals , created foxes with floppy ears , rounder skulls and flatter faces , with stubbier noses and shorter jaws that crowded their teeth			0
he looked for foxes that displayed friendly behaviour that was not fearful or aggressive , but calm and eager and sociable			2
according to dr @entity70 , the link is hormonal and estradiol and serotonin , which regulate behaviour , also dictate some aspects of development			0
in her research , published in the @entity100 , dr @entity70 said in a sociable species such as the human race , people seek out those with friendly faces for partners			2
she found that the same features of the foxes – flat faces , a small nose , more delicate jaw and large forehead – are sought after features of a partner for humans			1
dr @entity70 also said the presence of such characteristics in people ’s children also plays a role in dictating how they treat their offspring			1
more than 15 separate studies have shown that mothers treat prettier or more handsome children better than less attractive children , even if they claim they treat them equally			0
geneticist @entity76 tried to breed tamer silver foxes ( pictured ) , which could be more easily handled			0
he found the selective breeding process , which focused on breeding the friendliest animals , created foxes with floppy ears , rounder skulls and flatter faces , with stubbier noses and shorter jaws in the animal kingdom , parents might neglect uglier offspring , resulting in their death , inadvertently making sure ‘ beautiful ’ features were passed on to the next generation			1
if the features do indeed indicate an animal is friendlier and more sociable , as they do in foxes , these characteristic would also be passed down the genetic line			1
dr @entity70 said that in humans , attractive children are largely better adjusted and more popular than less attractive children , according to 33 studies			0
they are also believed to have higher intelligence and better social skills			0
one study found that babies just a few days old preferred the faces of classically beautiful people , while another piece of research said people are more beautiful now than in the past , as beauty is evolving			2
this has reportedly been shown by assessing the beauty of reconstructions of early humans			0
while the studies seem to back up dr @entity70 ’s findings , they do not prove it , but her studies suggest facial beauty is not an arbitrary characteristic , but a sign of a good character .			0

a @entity80 experiment to breed friendlier foxes in 1959 suggests that an *affable* looking face is more desirable as it signifies sociable behaviour
research by the @entity29 found attributes of a ' beautiful ' fox face are similar to the features of an attractive human
the presence of characteristics such as a soft jaw and small nose in children plays a role in dictating how a mother treats them , according to research
