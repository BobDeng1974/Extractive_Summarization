@entity1 's rise over the past eighteen months has been remarkable , the appointment of @entity9 in june 2013 the first step in a huge transformation of the @entity6 club 's fortunes both on and off the field			1
despite initial fears after being drawn in @entity12 with both @entity13 and @entity14 , the @entity10 now stand on the verge of a place in the knockout stages , easily capable of notching the win they need over the reigning @entity20 champions			2
not only is their destiny in their own hands , it is also highly likely after yet another disappointing showing in the competition from @entity28 's side			0
@entity1 will qualify for the knockout stage of the @entity30 if they beat @entity14 on wednesday manager @entity9 has transformed @entity1 during his 18 months in charge of the club @entity9 's attacking brand of football is the perfect formula for overcoming @entity14 @entity1 play an exciting and entertaining brand of attacking football that is both rarely seen on the peninsula and ideal for exploiting the weaknesses @entity14 have shown			1
the pace and width that domestic opponents have proven ill - equipped to cope with has set new club records for most points ( 85 ) , wins ( 26 ) and clean sheets ( 21 ) in a season and is also the perfect formula for overcoming wednesday 's opponents			2
as @entity49 showed at the @entity50 last month , @entity48 remains a liability , committing errors from which the @entity54 side scored both their goals in an embarrassing 2 - 1 win			0
with @entity57 in the kind of form that makes him unrecognisable from the forlorn figure seen at @entity61 and @entity62 a similarly frightening prospect , @entity1 's wingers will give the @entity66 defender another torrid evening			1
@entity57 is unrecognisable from the player who endured a difficult time at @entity61 @entity57 and @entity62 possess pace on the wings to trouble @entity14 's backline @entity73 retains his sharpness and intelligence and @entity1 's play is dictated by the classy forward his two seasons in @entity79 saw him ridiculed constantly , but a reunion with former @entity81 boss @entity9 has seen @entity57 deliver at the level which saw @entity83 invest over Â£ 10 million in him back in 2011			1
in fifty games for @entity1 , he has netted fourteen goals and the same number of assists , a vital part of that impressive attacking trident based around the timeless talent of @entity73			2
as he showed in the first meeting with @entity14 , the club captain retains the sharpness and intelligence that has always typified his performances			0
a well - taken goal saw him embarrass a sluggish defence , and his team - mates are perfectly set - up to continue that in wednesday 's crucial final encounter			2
their 4 - 3 - 3 formation is built upon an excellent midfield , the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 and the returning @entity104 possessing the quality needed at this level			0
' we have a good chance of winning , ' @entity109 said this week , ' because we 're a good team capable of putting @entity14 in difficulty			0
' @entity14 will be without star striker @entity113 , who injured his knee against @entity115 on saturday @entity116 will also be absent for the @entity20 champions through suspension with @entity116 suspended and @entity113 injured , @entity1 firmly believe they can overcome the reigning @entity20 champions			1
they remain unpredictable , a point highlighted by their two previous home games in the competition in which they despatched @entity49 5 - 1 , but were then demolished 7 - 1 by @entity13			0
with the @entity123 always a tough place for visiting teams , @entity1 play a style which the crowd in the capital city loves , seeing the volume raise even higher in appreciation of the players representing them			0
it is into that atmosphere that @entity14 will be treading on wednesday evening , and the @entity10 should be more than good enough to secure the point they need to progress .			1

@entity1 take on @entity14 in a crucial clash on wednesday
*victory* for the @entity6 will see them progress at @entity14 's *expense*
@entity1 's pace on the wings can exploit @entity14 's weaknesses
@entity144 is without @entity113 and @entity116
