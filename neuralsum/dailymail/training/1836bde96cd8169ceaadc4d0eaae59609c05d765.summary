@entity15 and his wife had once owned the house where mrs @entity2 lived and in 1994 she put the land surrounding the property into his joint ownership			1
ms @entity37 said : ' this was not a normal friendship , this was not a normal business relationship			0
' its clear @entity2 during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him			1

' @entity30 , prosecuting despite their close relationship , the court heard that things changed on christmas day , 2007 , when @entity15 attacked mrs @entity2			1

mrs @entity2 wrote in a diary entry written around the time of the incident : ' @entity115 snapped today			1
not a day to remember			0
' ' ( @entity116 ) went wild			0
i got thumped aside my jaw - ear - deaf - aches			0
must think about future , what went wrong			0
' she added : ' perhaps once again i have ( unclear ) my usefulness			0
i will not wait for a third			0
' the day after the alleged incident , she wrote : ' then had the gall to tell me to get out			2
disgraceful conduct , ' and she noted bruises emerging over the next days , while expressing her loneliness			0
investigation : a forensics tent surrounds the manhole where mrs @entity2 's body was found in january of this year however , on december 30 that year a diary entry stated she had spoken to @entity15			1
she said : ' what a weight off my mind			0
i ’m sorry , i would not have chosen this but i must adjust			0
' @entity142 ms @entity37 said : ' it ’s not clear what arrangement they had come to but what is clear was this was not a normal relationship			0
' mrs @entity2 was described as a recluse by her neighbours who disliked traveling			1
she worked for 10 years for a couple of retired medical professionals cleaning their home and had a reputation for being intelligent and fit and healthy			0
' its clear @entity2 during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him			1
' @entity30 , prosecuting but @entity15 cast doubt on this after she had disappeared , by implying to her friends that she had displayed the early signs of dementia , ms @entity37 told the court			1
she said this was part of his effort to lay a false trail to confuse those searching for her , to make them think she had gone to @entity172 where her daughter @entity173 lived at the time			0
ms @entity37 said : ' it was well known by friends and neighbours that she had fallen out with @entity173 some years before , so what he devised was a trail of evidence that she had gone to stay on december 22 with somebody called @entity183 , who apparently lived in @entity184 , and was going to take her to see @entity173			0
' this was quite untrue			0
@entity2 had no intention of going to @entity172			1
' @entity15 was also accused of using text messages to try to throw investigators off the scent			1
two messages were sent by a phone in mrs @entity2 ’s possession but registered to him , on december 18 and 22			1
co-defendants : @entity195 , left , and @entity196 , right , both deny perverting the course of justice the first , sent to @entity15 ’ phone , confirmed she had bought the train tickets for her journey to @entity172			1
detectives discovered no tickets were ever bought			0
the second read : ' please thank @entity205 for taking me to @entity91 railway station			0
i have arrived in @entity184 safely			0
' ms @entity37 said mobile phone cell site analysis said in both cases the messages had been sent and received by phone masts covering @entity86			0
she said it was consistent with the phones being next to each other on the same table and @entity15 sending them to himself to cover his tracks			1
she said of the second call : ' the handset was nowhere near the north of @entity220			0
the one thing we can be sure of is @entity2 was not in @entity184			2
she was almost certainly dead by that point			2
' the prosecution believes that mrs @entity2 died on december 22 because she and @entity15 visited mutual friends - mr and mrs @entity227 - who described her as wearing the same clothes that her body was found in			1
@entity15 , 63 , who appeared over video link after the jury was told he had been unwell , denies a single charge of murder			2
co-defendant @entity196 , 74 , denies one count of perverting the course of justice and @entity195 , 73 , denies two counts of perverting the course of justice			0
