@entity1 's legacy as secretary of state is thin , judging from a press conference tuesday in which the @entity5 's chief spokeswoman could n't articulate any of the future presidential candidate 's achievements on the job			1
she 's not alone , with experts of all political stripes finding it difficult to bolster @entity13 's resume as @entity15 's top diplomat			1
the former secretary of state herself had trouble articulating any lasting achievements from her tenure , during an april 3 appearance at the @entity22 in @entity23			0
' can you , off the top of your head , identify one tangible achievement that ... resulted from the last @entity37 ? ' asked an @entity46 reporter during the daily briefing			2
' i am certain that those who were here at the time , who worked hard on that effort , could point out one , ' @entity26 replied through a forced smile			2
' i ’m sure there are a range of things that were put into place that i ’m not even aware of , ' she offered moments later			0
' i wo n’t hold my breath , ' the reporter shot back			0
video of the exchange rocketed across the @entity63 and quickly found its way to network television , bringing guffaws from a @entity32 panel ' given @entity1 ’s obvious ambitions that we continually talk about , although she ’s not giving us much to go off of , it should not have been a surprising question , ' said @entity73 reporter @entity72 , a guest appearing with chief national correspondent @entity74			1
the question stumped @entity13 herself on april 3			2
' when you look at your time as secretary of state , what are you most proud of ? ' the @entity81 moderator asked			2
' and what do you feel was unfinished , and maybe have another crack at one day ? ' “ well , i really see – that was good – that ’s why he wins prizes , ' @entity13 dissembled			2
asked in april to name her own crowning achievement as secretary of state , @entity1 talked only about the collaborative ' relay race ' of setting policy searching for a @entity1 fan : @entity94 executive chairman @entity93 thinks she was ' the most consequential secretary of state since @entity95 , ' @entity97 's legendary global emissary @entity1 will likely be back to kissing babies on the campaign trail as she prepares to run for president in 2016 -- but she suffers from an ' achievement gap ' from her time as secretary of state ' look , i really see my role as secretary , in fact leadership in general in a democracy , as a relay race			1
when you run the best race you can run , you hand off the baton			0
some of what has n’t been finished may go on to be finished , so when president @entity113 asked me to be secretary of state i agreed			1
' she ultimately took credit for vaguely ' setting the values , setting the standards ' of @entity15 global leadership			0
@entity120 , the former clinton white house counsel in @entity13 's administration , said @entity1 has succeeded in becoming ' the most popular woman in the world ' ' i just do n’t want to lose that because we have a dysfunctional political situation in @entity128			1
then of course , a lot of particulars , but i am finishing my book so you ’ll be able to read all about it			0
' @entity13 may be left with an embarrassing bit of unfinished business to explain in 2016 : a whopping $ 6 billion in @entity5 funds that went missing because of improper contracting procedures			1
contract files worth $ 2.1 billion , according to an inspector general report , ' could not be located at all			0
' ' the failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the @entity5 ’s contract actions , ' the report added			0
talking heads , including some @entity13 partisans , have struggled to name any of her achievements at the helm of @entity5			1
@entity151 , a political action committee that is among the leaders of the pre-emptive @entity154 movement on the political right , assembled a list on wednesday			0
' you think @entity1 has an " accomplishment problem " ahead of her book release ? ' the group jabbed			0
' the top - ten list is ripe for @entity163 mocking			0
@entity120 , the @entity164 counsel during the @entity13 administration , told radio host @entity166 on january 29 that the former first lady 's chief accomplishment was encouraging ' goodwill around the world			1
' ' this is a secretary of state – is the most popular woman in the world , and restored relations with everyone , ' said @entity120			1
@entity73 searched in december for insiders who would echo @entity94 executive chairman @entity93 's claim that @entity13 was ' the most consequential secretary of state since @entity95 ' in the @entity97 administration			2
but ' even many of her most ardent defenders recognize @entity1 had no signal accomplishment at the @entity5 to her name , ' the newspaper concluded , ' no indelible peace sealed with her handshake , no war averted , no nuclear crisis defused			1
' ' there are few @entity191 out there still willing to make the case for her as an enormously consequential figure in the history of @entity197			0
' @entity73 tracked down @entity198 , who was in charge of @entity5 policy planning in the @entity202 administration			0
he said @entity13 's ' great weakness was avoiding serious diplomacy			1
' ' it is hard to avoid the conclusion that for @entity13 , the @entity208 role was substantially about positioning her to run for president , ' @entity198 told the newspaper , ' especially in terms of looking " tough " on some of the big issues : @entity215 sanctions , reassuring @entity217 allies			1
' ' not taking on the big diplomatic challenges made that toughness easier to maintain even as she devoted so much of her actual time in office to " soft " issues like education , women ’s empowerment , etc. '			0

@entity26 , the @entity5 's chief *spokesperson* , seemed blindsided by a question about @entity13 's accomplishments
a @entity32 panel erupted into laughter when @entity26 's gaffe was shown
@entity13 herself could n't articulate what she was ' most proud of ' during her time as @entity15 's top diplomat when asked just weeks *ago*
a former @entity164 counsel from the @entity13 presidency defended @entity1 on radio as ' the most popular woman in the world '
she 's likely to run for president in 2016 but faces an ' achievement gap ' from her time in president @entity113 's *cabinet*
