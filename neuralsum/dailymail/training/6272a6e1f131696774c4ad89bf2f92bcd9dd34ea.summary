' not my call , ' he said tuesday during his monthly call - in show on @entity19			0
' i 'm confident in president @entity8 's judgment			2

the new boss : @entity25 , the first woman to head @entity6 ' athletic department , has promised a restart for the program axed : former @entity6 coach @entity62 was fired on april 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs ' one of the primary reasons for using a search firm is that they 're supposed to completely vet a candidate for a senior management position , so i 'm a little mystified as to why this comes from the press and not the search committee , ' said @entity143 , dean of the @entity144 at @entity6 , who was on the search committee but out of the country for much of the process			1

' angry : the video , which was screened by @entity182 , showed several moments when mr @entity62 angrily pushed , shoved and grabbed his players during practices admission : @entity64 , pictured right with @entity62 , has admitted that his decision to suspend @entity62 in december - and not fire him - was the wrong move @entity189 , a graduate assistant for the @entity191 ' sports information department from 1994 - 96 , said he did n't see any instances of abuse while handling media inquiries for the volleyball program under @entity25			1
