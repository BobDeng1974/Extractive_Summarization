a fifth of mothers who gave birth in 2013 were older than their child 's father , a new study revealed today			1
the @entity6 examined the age gap of parents in the most recent year available			1
it shows how the gap is wider among unmarried couples , lesbian couples and those where at least one partner was born outside the @entity16			1
in 2013 , one in five mothers was older than the father of their child , the @entity6 found almost 12 per cent of couples who had a baby were the same age , but in 7 per cent of births the father was more than 10 years older there were almost 700,00 births in 2013			1
in 19.9 per cent of births the mother was older than the father			2
in 7 per cent of cases , the man was was more than 10 years older			0
by contrast , 0.48 per cent , around 3,100 births , the mother was more 10 years older than the father			0
amongs married couples the gap was four years on average , compared to 4.2 years among parents who had not tied the knot			0
however , the average gap of 4.2 years was the same among parents who lived together and those who lived apart			0
for babies whose parents were both born in the @entity16 , the gap was just 3.7 years , rising to 4.6 years where one parent was born abroad			0

it is the first time the @entity6 has examined the age gaps of the nation 's parents			1
@entity55 , senior research officer at the @entity6 , said : ' we can see that men are older than women and the gap tens to be fairly small			2
' but there is a huge chunk , of 7 per cent , where the father is more than 10 years older			0
' he said wider age gaps , especially among @entity67 born parents , could be the result of cultural differences			2
' there are definitely some cultures in which a younger bride is desirable and where a bride the same age or even older is not what you want at all			0
