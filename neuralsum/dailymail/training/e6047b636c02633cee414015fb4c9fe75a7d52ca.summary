@entity0 will fight for the @entity2 super middleweight title on april 25 at @entity4 's @entity3 following confirmation that @entity6 is relinquishing that belt			1
the announcement came from promoter @entity9 by way of a 29th birthday present for @entity0			0
but the mood of celebration was soured by @entity0 's adviser , @entity14 , repeating the slur that ' @entity6 is a coward for not defending the title against @entity0 in the ring '			1
@entity0 ( left ) will fight for the @entity2 super middleweight title on april 25 at @entity4 's @entity3 @entity18 ( right ) will fight for the @entity2 super middleweight title following @entity6 's relinquishing of that belt @entity0 lost a contentious decision to @entity22 ( right ) in 2011 in their grudge match @entity9 and @entity0 's trainer , @entity25 , refused to association themselves with that remark			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , is negotiating for two major defences of his @entity31 world title against @entity32 at the @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35			2
@entity9 confirmed also that @entity22 is declining the possible opportunity of being the opponent for @entity0 in the fight for the vacant @entity2 title			1
@entity22 , who narrowly defeated @entity0 in their first grudge match , was second in line behind no 2 contender , @entity43			0
negotiations with @entity43 to meet @entity0 have already commenced , although the @entity45 is wary of returning to @entity46 after believing he was robbed of a decision against @entity6 in @entity48			1
@entity9 says : ' we will get a decision on @entity43 quickly by pressing for purse bids if he wants this agreement			0
@entity6 has vacated his @entity2 world title having not fought since beating @entity22 last may @entity6 had been due to face @entity54 in march but had to withdraw with an injury ' if @entity43 refuses the fight then we will move down the list of contenders , starting with @entity59 , @entity60			1
but whatever happens , @entity0 will fight for the title on april 25 and i believe will become world champion that night			1
' @entity0 is bidding to become the first @entity66 boxer to go on from winning @entity68 gold and then winning a world title			2
he says : ' i do n't care who is in the opposite corner			0
' i would n't even care if it was @entity73 , who everyone seems to think is the best super middleweight in the world			2
' it would be nice if it 's @entity43 because i believe that us two and @entity73 are the three top super middleweights			0
of course i would like it to be in @entity4 but if his team come up with more money then it would n't bother me to fight him in @entity45			0
' it has taken more than six years for @entity0 to be given this chance since winning gold in @entity89 , and @entity9 says : ' he 's waited very patiently			0
' he 's boxed beautifully in his latest fights and he deserves his shot			0

@entity0 will fight on april 25 at @entity4 's @entity3
it comes following confirmation that @entity6 is relinquishing his belt
@entity0 will get his shot at the @entity2 super middleweight title
