@entity0 is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the @entity3 squad ahead of the @entity4 despite being overlooked once again by @entity5			1
@entity0 has been one of the star performers since @entity7 gained promotion back into the @entity9 back in 2012			2
the 27 - year - old has represented @entity3 at every level from the @entity12 to the @entity13 and was even made captain of the under 21s team for the @entity16 in 2009			1
but he has somehow failed to catch the attention of @entity5 who even called up @entity19 's inexperienced midfielder @entity18 ahead of him for the forthcoming games against @entity21 and @entity22 when @entity23 was forced to pull out of the squad with a groin injury			2
@entity0 ( right ) , @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity28 pose outside @entity7 's future home the @entity7 will be moving to the @entity30 in @entity31 next summer however , @entity0 says he will not sulk over the matter and will continue to show his best form for @entity7 as he looks to help the club push for a @entity36 place as they prepare to move into the @entity30 next summer			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i have made it clear what i think about the situation and i would love to play for my country			2
but obviously at the moment it does n't look like it is going to happen			0
‘ i will keep playing as well as i can at @entity7 and enjoying it every week			2
you never know what will happen in the future			0
@entity5 takes charge of @entity3 training , having overlooked @entity0 for the squad yet again @entity19 midfielder @entity18 ( second left ) was a late call up in the position played by @entity0 ‘ when we move to the @entity30 we have to be thinking about @entity36 football because of the gate receipts and the money coming into the club and hopefully we will be able to invest in better players			1
we invested really well last summer and that has shown this season			0
’ @entity0 hopes he will given a better chance of an @entity3 call - up following the proposals by @entity65 chairman @entity64 this week to limit the number of @entity68 players playing in this country			1
@entity70 has come through the @entity19 youth system and only made a name for himself in the top flight back in november , but has already been rewarded for his outstanding season with his first call - up into the @entity3 squad this week			1
@entity0 has been one of the standout performers since @entity7 returned to the top flight in 2012 the 27 - year - old has represented @entity3 at every age level from the under 16s to @entity13 21s @entity0 feels a number of other home - grown players could now follow @entity70 into the senior squad if they are given the chance to play on a regular basis			1
when asked about @entity64 's proposals , @entity0 added : ‘ i think that is great			1
when i came through into the league i was played at 17			0
you do n't get that a lot now with players coming through the academies			0
’ if you do that you have to be very special because of the foreign players coming in			0
we have got the best league in the world and we want to keep it like that , but it will be nice to see some of our homegrown boys given a chance			0
’ @entity103 supports the @entity104 as part of its mission to bring communities together			0
