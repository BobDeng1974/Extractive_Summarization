but a new device may help parents rest easier while their baby sleeps , and keep their little one 's feet warm at the same time			1
a team from @entity10 , @entity11 , have created a sock - like baby monitor which straps around an infant ’s foot and uses pulse oximetry to monitor the heart rate and blood - oxygen levels			1
the inventors hope it will reduce the annual cases of @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which number around 2,500 in the @entity42 and 300 each year @entity43 and his five colleagues hope the device , which is completely wireless and uses safe , non-invasive technology , will reduce the annual cases of @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which sees at least 300 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly in the @entity48 every year			1
mr @entity43 , himself a father of two , said : ' our hope is that we can give parents time to react and see that something ’s wrong before it ’s too late			1
' it joins a host of other high tech gadgets for new and expecting - and anxious - parents			2
this week @entity61 inventors devised a way to transform the commonplace ultrasound scan into an anatomically correct resin replica of a foetus for parents to handle and keep as a memento			0
the nine - centimetre ( 3.6 - inch ) resin model of the white foetus , encased in a transparent block in the shape of the mother 's body , is fashioned by a 3d printer			2
student @entity43 and his team recently debuted a prototype of their @entity77 at the third annual student @entity81 competition			0
they won both first place and crowd favorite awards , with cash prizes totaling $ 6,000 .			0

it works by strapping around an infant ’s foot and *measuring* heart rate and blood - oxygen levels
*scientists* hope the device could help cut the number of cases of @entity40 - or cot *deaths*
