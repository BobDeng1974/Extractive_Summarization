around an hour before kick - off in the north @entity3 derby , @entity0 will welcome a delegation of @entity6 officials into his spacious boardroom at @entity8			1
the conversation with @entity6 ’s chief executive @entity10 will be polite and cordial , barely scratching the surface before @entity0 sits down for pre-match brunch with a table full of @entity14 executives			1
later this month , when @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 walk up the stairs of the @entity20 on february 22 , the atmosphere will be a little bit more chilly			0
@entity14 chairman @entity0 relishes the negotiating battle that comes with player transfers @entity0 blocked a loan move for striker @entity25 to rivals @entity26 on deadline day @entity0 's tactics when talking to @entity26 irked @entity26 executives @entity17 and @entity30 ( right ) @entity26 are tired of @entity0 , irritated by his negotiating tactics on transfer deadline day after he refused to allow @entity25 to move to @entity33			1
they are in no rush to deal with him again			0
@entity0 has an extraordinary reputation within the game and he is always willing to come to the table in the transfer window , so long as the terms are in @entity14 ’s favour			1
as one owner of a @entity44 club told @entity45 in the aftermath of deadline day : ‘ @entity0 likes to squeeze your balls until your eyes start to water ’			1
@entity0 comes alive in the window , spending hours on the phone to a network of agents			1
@entity56 , plus @entity59 ’s representative @entity57 and his assistant @entity60 are all on speed dial as he plots @entity14 ’s next move			1
@entity0 was anointed by @entity14 ’s principal owner @entity63 , who is also his godfather , when his investment vehicle @entity65 bought the club from sir @entity67 in 2001			1
all three are ruthless businessmen			0
@entity69 sent out a cryptic tweet after @entity26 were unable to secure the arrival of striker @entity25 @entity0 ( right ) was given his role at @entity14 by principal owner @entity63 who is his godfather @entity59 signed from @entity74 for £ 7m and sold to @entity75 for £ 86m			1
profit : £ 79m @entity76 - up : 1128.5 % @entity77 signed from @entity26 for £ 3.5m and sold to @entity78 for £ 18.6m			1
£ 15.1m 431.4 % @entity79 signed from @entity80 from £ 7m and sold to @entity81 for £ 20.3m			0
£ 13.3m 190 % @entity82 signed from @entity83 for £ 10.9m and sold to @entity78 for £ 30.75m			0
£ 19.85m 182 % @entity84 signed from @entity85 for £ 16.5m and sold to @entity75 for £ 33m			0
£ 16.5m 100 % he is at the training ground most days , arriving anywhere between 8 - 8.30am to begin work			0
much of his time recently has been spent focused on the new stadium development			0
@entity0 rises early , responding to text and @entity93 messages long before he leaves the family home in @entity95 , north @entity3 , for the journey to the training centre			1
it is there , at their magnificent new hub on the outskirts of @entity103 , that @entity0 spent the day setting up deals by telephone and email last monday			1
he appointed @entity107 as technical director in 2013 , partly to detach himself from the frenzied atmosphere at the club on deadline day			1
two years on , he can not resist			0
‘ @entity0 never raises his voice or shouts , even when transfers or deals are at their most delicate stage , ’ revealed the club ’s former director of football @entity113			2
‘ that is why he always wins , because others lose their temper or start shouting			0
he is a calculated guy and he is prepared to wait and wait			0
‘ most people get nervous or anxious , but he enjoys the challenge			0
he is an excellent negotiator			0
’ when @entity79 went on loan to @entity26 in january 2011 , an argument over removal cost amounting to £ 5,000 nearly scuppered the deal			2
@entity0 squeezes the pips on everything			2
@entity113 ( right ) praised @entity0 for his composure when negotiating transfer deals for @entity14 he spends hours in his vault on the first floor during the transfer window , pacing up and down a spartanly furnished office hypothesising over potential transfers on a notepad on his desk			1
last monday , when @entity0 swept into @entity14 ’s training centre , he was ready for business			1
deals were there to be done			0
@entity143 , who has earned comparisons to @entity145 in the scouting reports filed for the club ’s new head of recruitment @entity149 , was already on his way for a medical			0
by then his football - mad son @entity152 , who works in the @entity154 for an investment bank , was asking people he has come across in the game whether @entity143 was good for the money			0
the day was starting to take shape			0
@entity26 and @entity161 had both made enquiries for midfielder @entity163			2
@entity164 wanted to get something going for central defender @entity166			0
@entity14 signed 18 - year - old @entity167 on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to @entity169 @entity26 and @entity161 had both asked about the availability of midfielder @entity163 ( left ) @entity172 defender @entity166 ( left ) had also caught the interest of @entity175 club @entity164 in @entity176 the pace picked up again when that nuisance @entity25 cropped up again in conversation			1
there was an air of anticipation because @entity0 somehow had to convince the £ 100,000 - a - week forward to swap a @entity184 final against @entity185 on march 1 for a relegation battle with @entity187			2
@entity188 were desperate , calling up and offering to pay £ 75,000 towards @entity25 ’s salary for the rest of the season			2
predictably he did n’t fancy it			0
later that afternoon , around 3pm , @entity25 ’s agent @entity193 , the son of former @entity6 vice-chairman @entity17 , believed he had devised a plan to suit all parties			2
it is at this moment , against the advice of practically everybody involved in the decision - making process at @entity8 , @entity0 refused to cede any ground			1
in the past , during negotiations to move to the @entity203 for a year or to tenant @entity33 during the rebuilding of a new super-stadium at @entity8 , @entity201 felt he attempted to push her around			0
anyone who has ever come across @entity26 ’s chief executive will tell you that @entity201 is a formidable lady			2
she can look after herself			0
when @entity0 negotiated with @entity75 for the @entity59 deal , @entity14 got a record transfer fee @entity59 ( left ) eventually signed for @entity75 from @entity14 for a transfer fee of £ 86million @entity26 were offering to pay 50 per cent of @entity25 ’s wages , £ 50,000 - a - week , but @entity0 was well within his rights to point out the offer on the table from @entity187			1
@entity26 needed to up the ante			2
with the clock ticking on deadline day , @entity0 also made it clear that he did not want to sell to a perceived rival for fourth place in the @entity44 , or to leave his squad weaker than when the window closed			1
others felt differently , concerned that @entity25 ’s dreadful attitude would affect the team ’s rhythm in the run up to the @entity184 final at @entity232			2
@entity0 re-iterated that he calls the shots			2
his behaviour , along with his bargaining position , infuriated @entity26 and it prompted some stinging criticism from @entity69 via social media when the window closed at 11pm			2
there are no winners here			0
there have been times when @entity0 has used reverse psychology , working a situation to his advantage to get the best possible deal for @entity14			1
in the summer of 2013 , @entity75 offered £ 55m up front for @entity59			2
@entity0 told @entity14 ’s board that he would not sell the forward , but @entity59 ’s heart was already set on a move to the @entity252			1
what followed was unusual for @entity0 , but he played the role of the junior partner in negotiations with @entity75 ’s president @entity257 in spectacular fashion			0
@entity0 played him like a fiddle , deferring to @entity257 when he agreed to fly out to @entity75 on a private jet on two separate occasions to negotiate the terms over @entity59 ’s transfer from @entity14			1
@entity0 wants to see more homegrown players such as @entity266 ( centre ) play in the @entity14 first team when he emerged from dinner on the second occasion , @entity257 had agreed to pay a world record fee of £ 86m to sign @entity59 from @entity8			1
the dispute between the two clubs over the precise figures is because the transfer fee will be substanially less if @entity75 can pay quicker than the five - year schedule agreed by @entity0 and @entity257			1
occasionally @entity0 ’s staff see a softer side and they were surprised when he agreed to take the ice - bucket challenge after he was nominated by @entity280 last year			0
@entity0 responded by @entity281 , citing the departures of @entity84 and @entity59 to @entity75 over the past few years as the reasons behind his decision			1
he can be generous too and he once delivered a @entity285 2 ( but not a @entity286 , which is more expensive ) to @entity288 ’s home as a gesture of goodwill when @entity14 were performing well under their @entity292 coach			0
mostly , though , he is working on the serious business of making @entity14 competitive and he has an almost pathological desire to reassert themselves in the top four			1
with the rapid progress of @entity266 and @entity298 , he wants @entity299 , academy manager and head of coaching , to bring more young players into the first team			0
@entity0 has also been delighted to see @entity298 ( centre ) make his way into the @entity14 senior squad the decision to sign @entity143 from @entity169 is another sign that @entity14 are once again investing in raw talent			1
in a few months time the transfer window will be on his radar and he can start to prepare for a serious turnover of playing staff before next season			0
as ever , @entity0 will walk away with the feeling that he has the upper hand .			0

@entity0 incensed @entity26 with his deadline day negotiating methods
he refused to let @entity25 join a perceived top four rival
his tactics meant @entity14 got a world record fee for @entity59
