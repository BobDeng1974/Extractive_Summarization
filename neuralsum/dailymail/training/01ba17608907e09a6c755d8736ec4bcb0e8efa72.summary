scientists at @entity1 say they have pinpointed deadly ' mother cells ' which produce tumours and keep them alive scientists have got to the root of cancer			1
they ’ve pinpointed the deadly ‘ mother cells ’ that give birth to tumours and keep them alive			1
a drug that kills these menacing cells could wipe out the disease – and cure patients			1
despite advances in medicine , cancer claims more than 150,000 lives a year , making it one of @entity20 ’s biggest killers			1
the ‘ mother cells ’ , or cancer stem cells , are blamed for the disease ’s spread throughout the body – the most common cause of death in cancer patients			1
they are also believed to be resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and so explain why cancers come back after treatment			2
long thought to exist , they have for the first time been identified and tracked in cancer patients			0
the breakthrough was made by @entity1 researchers who studied men and women with a form of leukaemia			0
they showed that a small proportion of the cancerous cells were extra-dangerous			0
the disease started in these stem cells			2
the stem cells also made all the cells that made up the cancer – and were vital if it was to stay alive			2
this is important because it means that a drug that kills the ‘ mother cells ’ could eliminate the disease			1
the concept has been likened to getting rid of dandelions by pulling them out by the roots , rather than merely removing their heads			0
researcher dr @entity61 said : ‘ we have identified a subset of cancer cells , shown that these cells are invariably the cells in which the cancer originates and are also the only cancer - propagating cells in the patients			0
‘ it is a vitally important step because it suggests that if you want to cure patients , you would need to target and remove these cells at the root of the cancer			2
‘ but that would be sufficient , that would do it			0
’ dr @entity61 cautioned that new drugs take time to develop but added : ‘ now we know that identity of these cells in this particular group of patients , the next thing is to try to understand the biology that makes them different			0
scientists say a drug that kills the mother cells could wipe out the disease , one cancerous cell pictured , and cure patients ‘ is there anything in that biology we can take advantage of to design a therapy that would allow their elimination ? ’ the researchers studied one particular form of the blood cancer leukaemia			1
however , they think the same principle likely applies to other types of the disease			0
professor @entity107 , a @entity109 stem cell expert based at the @entity110 , said : ‘ this finding of rare human cancer stem cells in patients with a blood disorder that often develops into acute leukaemia is a huge leap towards understanding the roots of blood cancers			1
‘ @entity109 stem cells have long been thought to be at the heart of many types of cancers but identifying these rogue cells has been a major challenge			2
‘ the next step will be to find specific drugs that eliminate these unique cells , which could be key to helping more people survive cancer			0

scientists claim they have pinpointed ' mother cells ' which produce tumours
add a drug that kills the cells could wipe out the disease and cure patients
cancer stem cells are blamed for the disease *'s* spread throughout the body
also believed to be resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy
@entity109 claims more than 150,000 lives every year in @entity20
