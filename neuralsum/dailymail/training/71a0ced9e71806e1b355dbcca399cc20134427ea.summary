' in fact she was a horse dealer and sold him on			2
' i contacted the police and gave them evidence of what she was doing but they could n't do anything and told me i had to go through civil courts			0

but just two weeks ago ms @entity4 received a call out of the blue from a riding school north of the border in @entity29 , central @entity30 ' the people who had him have either removed or deliberately scrambled the microchip saying he was mine			1
' so when the riding school got him they had no reason to suspect anything			1

' @entity7 had been sold on to @entity101 who had bought the horse in good faith			1
