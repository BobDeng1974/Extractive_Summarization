by @entity0 rebels allied with a young @entity2 burst into the street outside @entity5 's @entity4 as soldiers loyal to strongman @entity7 rain gunfire from above			2
steps away , @entity10 and a young journalist friend dive for cover behind a parked car			0
an international film crew in recent weeks has been re-enacting this and other historic scenes in the streets of @entity5 for @entity18 , a biopic about the budding friendship between @entity10 and the reporter in the turbulent @entity22 of the 1950s			1
years in the making , producers say it is the first full - length feature film with a @entity27 director and actors to be shot in the country since the 1959 revolution			1
the movie is based on an autobiographical script by journalist @entity40 who befriended @entity10 while he lived on the island actor @entity33 sits down to have her makeup applied during the shooting of @entity18 in @entity22			1
she said being involved in the project has been ' chaotic ... but up there with my best experiences ' actor @entity49 during the filming of @entity18			2
he plays the journalist @entity40 who befriended @entity10 and went on his legendary fishing trips after sending the author a fan letter due to decades of ill will between the two countries and @entity58 's 52 - year - long embargo , other movies ostensibly set here , such as @entity59 and 1990 's @entity5 , were filmed in stand - in locations like the @entity61			1
' it was an absolute passion to actually make it in @entity22 where everything that is in the script happened , where the finca ( farm ) is where ( @entity10 ) lived , where his boat was , all the spots from the @entity71 to @entity72 where he fished , ' director @entity32 said			1
' it 's all here , so trying to duplicate it somewhere else was not very appealing			0
' shooting began in march and wrapped over the weekend on the joint @entity80 - @entity22 - @entity79 production , with the island 's governmental film institute known as @entity83 providing location support , period costumes and local actors			1
@entity18 came to @entity22 under a @entity79 @entity88 license exempting it from most embargo restrictions			2
the film 's makers said there was a cap on how much they could spend , but would not say how much or release overall budget figures			0
in this april 24 photo , actors and crew work on a fishing boat while shooting @entity18 in @entity38			2

an international film crew has filming in the streets of @entity5 in recent weeks author @entity10 at home in @entity22 in 1952			1
he lived on the island from 1939 to 1960 and wrote much of @entity110 there , for which he won the @entity112 tropical plants surround @entity114 , @entity10 's former estate , 12 kilometers from @entity5			1
the film crew have been allowed unprecedented access to the property @entity10 's desk in the study of @entity114 ( @entity114 ) where he wrote his masterpiece , @entity110 for licensing purposes the movie qualified as a documentary , since it depicts a firsthand account of real events that took place here			1
so it 's unlikely just any @entity27 blockbuster would get the same permission in the future			2
though the title derives from the @entity112 - winning novelist 's nickname , the movie is based on an autobiographical script by @entity40 , who is played by @entity49 ( @entity135 , @entity136 )			1
@entity10 is portrayed by theater and screen veteran @entity35			0
@entity40 was abandoned by his father as a young boy , fell in love with @entity10 's writing and later came to see him as a father figure			1
while working for the @entity143 in the 1950s , @entity40 wrote a letter to @entity10 professing his admiration			2
he did n't intend to send it , but his girlfriend found it and dropped it in the mail			0
on a recent saturday , a reading room at the @entity153 library stood in for the @entity143 newsroom			0
@entity22 extras milled about in slim ties and saddle shoes , long skirts and horn - rimmed glasses			2
the scene retells the moment when @entity40 , known as @entity163 in the movie , fields a fateful phone call that at first he thinks is a prank by one of his pals			0
' good letter , kid , ' says @entity10			0
' you like to fish ? ' actors @entity49 , top left , @entity35 , top third right , and @entity33 ( sitting , right ) film scenes for the @entity10 biopic which has been years in the making film crews move equipment during a scene on a fishing boat in @entity38			1
years in the making , producers say it is the first full - length feature film with a @entity27 director and actors to be shot in the country since the 1959 revolution @entity10 fishes from his beloved boat @entity191 in @entity22 in the @entity192 during his time spent living on the island of @entity22 before long , @entity163 is on a boat with his idol , and the two strike up a friendship that would last until @entity10 's 1961 suicide			1
journalist @entity40 became friends with @entity10 in the 1950s after he sent him a fan letter the film crew got access to some of @entity5 's most iconic locales , including the @entity206 , which long ago was turned into a museum celebrating @entity2 's revolution			1
at the majestic @entity210 , which is closed for restoration , a sumptuous salon was tricked out to look like the bar of the @entity214 hotel where @entity10 frequently stayed			0
in this scene , @entity163 is tipped off by notorious mobster @entity216 ( actor @entity217 ; @entity218 , @entity219 ) that @entity221 director @entity220 has it out for @entity10			2
producers even secured unprecedented permission to shoot inside @entity10 's former estate , @entity114 , today considered such a shrine that tourists are n't even allowed inside and must peer in through the windows			1
sparks who has played @entity10 on stage since 2005 , confessed to something of a spiritual connection to the writer and said it was a magical experience portraying him in the land he loved			0
' to be playing a section of the film where he 's struggling with writer 's block , i 'm standing on exactly the square foot of ground that he stood on , with his typewriter in front of me , playing the scene			0
it was n't acting , it was channeling , ' @entity247 said			0
' it was just allowing him to come through			0
' there have also been some only - in - @entity22 moments of frustration			2
in a country with a history of high - seas defections , something as simple as getting on a boat requires official approval			0
so when cast members ' names were missing from a list one day , an open - water shoot was delayed			0
@entity49 , right , and @entity217 , second left , talk with the camera operator during the shooting of the movie @entity18			0
at the majestic @entity210 , which is closed for restoration , a sumptuous salon was tricked out to look like the bar of the @entity214 hotel where @entity10 frequently stayed @entity22 supporting actors wait for their scene during the shooting the movie @entity18			1
the film crew was granted access to some of @entity5 's most iconic locales director @entity32 , center , and actor @entity49 talk while shooting the movie			1
@entity32 said trying to make the movie in somewhere other than @entity22 ' was not very appealing ' @entity277 in @entity5 's historic old town was a well - known hangout of @entity10 in the 1950s			1
it is unclear if the movie will be filmed there although @entity22 officials have allowed @entity18 to be filmed at @entity10 's former estate on the island @entity22 's scarce and creaky internet service forced the crew to return to the yesteryear practice of slipping the day 's call sheets under hotel room doors , rather than sending them by email			1
much of the equipment had to be brought in from overseas to guarantee high production values			0
but the payoff was the opportunity to shoot in a city that has in many ways remained frozen in the 1950s , with classic @entity79 automobiles from the era readily available to provide a historic backdrop			0
' it 's been chaotic			0
every day there 's a new drama , ' said @entity304 actor @entity33 ( @entity305 , @entity306 ) , who plays @entity10 's fourth wife , @entity307			2
' it 's been so nutty			0
but you know what ? it 's up there with my best experiences			0
' @entity40 went on to a long career as a journalist and writer of books , tv shows and movies , including the screenplay for @entity323 , based on the @entity10 novel of the same name			0
@entity10 lived in @entity22 from 1939 to 1960 and wrote much of @entity110 and other works here , and islanders claim him as much as @entity79 do			1
the two countries ' mutual affection for @entity10 is among the few things they agree on			0
@entity22 and the @entity79 have cooperated multiple times to preserve his writings and belongings - so it 's not surprising the first @entity27 feature to shoot in @entity22 is about him			1
' @entity10 was probably the most prominent @entity79 to make @entity22 his home , and i think the people of @entity22 to this day cherish him and love him , ' said @entity32			2
' and hopefully this film will become an addition to that component of bridging this gap between two cultures and two peoples that have drifted apart			0
' @entity22 extras wait to film scenes for @entity18 in april			1
the city of @entity5 has in many ways remained frozen in the 1950s which makes it perfect for filming the period piece about @entity10			2

an international film crew in recent weeks has been filming in @entity22 for new @entity10 biopic @entity18
producers say it is the first full - length feature film with a @entity27 director and actors to be shot in the country since the 1959 revolution
@entity10 lived in @entity22 from 1939 to 1960 and wrote much of @entity110 on the island - his masterpiece which one him the @entity112
the @entity59 's scenes in @entity22 and 1990 's @entity5 , were filmed in stand - in locations like the @entity61
unprecedented permission to shoot in @entity10 's estate @entity114 - today considered such a shrine that tourists are n't even allowed inside
@entity10 is a huge tourist draw for @entity22 and the movie is likely to increase *visitors* to the island
