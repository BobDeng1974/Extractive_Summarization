by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 18:20 est , 4 may 2012 a @entity2 tycoon last night condemned his own firm for making an @entity5 advertisement surreptitiously shot in the @entity6 to claim ownership of the islands			1
sir @entity10 ’s surprise intervention came after foreign secretary @entity11 attacked the film as a ‘ stunt ’			0
sir @entity10 said he was ‘ appalled and embarrassed ’ by the ‘ totally unacceptable ’ advert , and that apologies had been issued			2
' an absolute insult ' : @entity19 hopeful @entity18 is seen running ' step - ups ' over the steps of the @entity2 @entity22 in the @entity6 the film , set to stirring martial music , shows @entity5 @entity19 hockey team player @entity18 , 34 , training in the @entity2 territory – including running on the spot on a war memorial – before ending with the slogan : ‘ to compete on @entity32 soil , we are training on @entity5 soil			1
’ @entity5 president @entity34 , who reiterated claims to the ‘ @entity6 ’ on the recent 30th anniversary of her nation ’s doomed invasion , put out the 90 - second advertisement on television in her country under her own name			1
mr @entity18 ratcheted the row up even further yesterday by revealing how filming took place under false pretences – and saying that as he performed he felt like he was ‘ running towards a battlefield ’			0
the advertisement was produced by the @entity50 wing of the advertising giant @entity52 , a subsidiary of sir @entity10 ’s firm @entity54			0
return to the @entity6 : @entity55 , who was injured in the war 30 years ago , and sir @entity10 ( right ) last night he said : ‘ the ad is totally unacceptable			1
the agency has formally apologised for any offence or pain caused			2
we are appalled and embarrassed by it			0
’ mr @entity11 said yesterday : ‘ @entity5 has had some diplomatic setbacks in the last few weeks			0
‘ they failed at a summit of the @entity66 to get other countries – @entity68 and @entity69 – to issue a declaration on the @entity6			1
i think what is happening is they are looking for one or two stunts to try to make up for that or save a bit of pride somehow			0
‘ but i do n’t think trying to misuse the @entity77 in some way for political purposes will go down very well with other countries			0
’ opening scene : after a caption reading ' @entity6 ' , the @entity5 name for the @entity6 , hockey player @entity18 is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run obvious landmarks : as the advert progresses , @entity18 can be seen limbering up outside the @entity87 , a popular pub in @entity88 passing all the sights : as rousing music reaches its eventual peak , @entity18 jogs past the office of the @entity93 , which today ran quotes from @entity96 @entity95 criticising the advert the @entity97 also criticised the advert as an attempt to exploit the @entity99 , while ignoring the @entity96 ’ wish to remain @entity2			1

‘ the filming took place in secret , ’ he added			0
‘ i ran thinking of my own personal training for the @entity77 but also with the idea in my head that i was running towards a battlefield			2
’ iconic @entity2 phone box : there 's little doubt over why the advert 's makers included this shot in the mix evocative and provocative : a close - up shot shows a hand , supposedly @entity18 's , meaningfully rolling sand through its fingers pointed message : with the rugged @entity6 countryside in the background , the caption reads : ' to compete on @entity32 soil ' dramatic pause : after the first caption fades out , the most incendiary comment follows : ' we are training on @entity5 soil ' final say : in an emotion - charged final shot , the screen fades to white with the message : ' tribute to the fallen and ex-combatants ' @entity52 sent @entity142 cameramen to arouse less suspicion before reportedly giving mrs @entity34 a copy of the film , then selling her government the right to use it			1
last night a spokesman for the firm in @entity149 said : ‘ we strongly condemn this work and have asked the @entity5 government to pull the spot			0
