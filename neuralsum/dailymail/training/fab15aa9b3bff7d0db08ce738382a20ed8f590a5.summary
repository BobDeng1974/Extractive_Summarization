by @entity0 new @entity2 captain @entity1 is the right man to lead @entity3 to @entity4 , according to @entity6 skipper @entity5			1
@entity5 hailed new @entity2 boss @entity7 for handing @entity1 the @entity9 armband , then tipped @entity10 to follow suit at international level			1
@entity1 is now the favourite to succeed @entity15 talisman @entity14 , who retired from international football following @entity3 's miserable @entity17 in @entity18			1
' it looks like @entity1 's going to be the main candidate for it , so i do n't see why not , ' said @entity5 at the official @entity38 launch			2
' if you look at the way he 's matured over the last few years , obviously there 's games where he probably does get a little too heated up , but that 's what we love about the way he plays - his passion			0
' and i 'm sure the @entity3 fans would love that as well			0
' i think it 's definitely a good decision for @entity2 to make him captain and i think the way he 's progressed over the last few years , settling down with a family and all sorts , i think he 'd be a great choice as @entity3 captain			2
' @entity5 admitted assuming the @entity6 armband has given him a new appreciation of how to help young stars like @entity64 and @entity65 fulfil their rich potential			2
out with the old : @entity1 is on course to replace retired @entity14 as captain the 31 - year - old defender backed @entity1 to thrive on guiding @entity2 's youngsters through the @entity38 ranks this season			1
@entity3 finished bottom of @entity73 in @entity18 with just one point and no victories in a lacklustre campaign , with captain @entity14 retiring in the aftermath			0
@entity78 revealed earlier this week he has never considered standing down , hinting that @entity1 is the front - runner for the captaincy , and @entity5 believes appointing the former @entity6 striker would be a shrewd move			1
' it 's easy to stand back when things are going well for the young players , ' said @entity5			2
' sometimes you can just let them get on with it - i 'm not even sure they get nervous any more			0
youth worker : @entity5 has backed @entity1 to help develop @entity3 's young players ' but when things go a little bit wrong , if there 's a mistake or a loss of form , it 's up to myself as captain and some of the older players just to put an arm around them , keep them going and get them to the place where they play their best football			1
' that 's what i 've been learning over the last 18 months , that 's the sort of role you want , you ca n't be giving too many tellings - off , it 's all about managing these young lads , because some of the ability they 've got is frightening			0
' you see in @entity117 how he has matured , and he knows how to help young players too			0
