by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 11 january 2013 bungling council workers have ruined historic cobblestones in a picturesque market town for the second time with clumsily painted yellow lines			1
people living in @entity7 , @entity8 - dubbed ' @entity10 's most attractive town ' by poet @entity11 - were horrified when they first discovered the messy lines smeared across the stones in @entity14 last november			1
the paint had ran into the cracks of the stones - which were laid in the @entity19 era - leaving them covered in unsightly , thick , yellow dollops			2
failed again : people complained to @entity23 after it attempted to paint yellow lines on the cobblestones in november ( left )			1
however , its second attempt ( right ) has not been much better highway workers from @entity23 were forced to remove the first set of wobbly lines after a string of complaints			1
but just two months later , the replacement lines have also failed to stick to the cobbles - leaving another mess on the town 's important landmark			1
red - faced council workers used an experimental paint for the second job but it started peeling within a week			2
@entity41 , 33 , who lives nearby , said : ' it 's absolute incompetence from the council			0
' surely if you get professionals in they should realise that liquid will run around obstacles like cobbles ? messy : residents were furious after council workers ruined the @entity19 cobbled streets in @entity7 with clumsily painted yellow lines			2
staff at @entity23 were forced to remove them what a mess : but the council did it again with this failed attempt which has resulted in the paint peeling away from the historic cobblestones in @entity7 , @entity8 ' then they used our taxpayers money to redo the job and they get it wrong again			1
' after messing it up the first time , i ca n't believe they used something experimental			0
' @entity7 is known for its old - fashioned cobbled streets but these people have made us a laughing stock			2
' @entity77 , 20 , who lives in the town , added : ' this beautiful medieval church precinct has been spoiled by the careless and unsightly ladling out of thick yellow paint			0
' it 's bad enough messing it up once but twice is unforgivable			0
' ruined : @entity7 residents say the yellow paint has destroyed the historic streetscape twice tourist favourite : visitors flock to the historic market town all year round , drawn by the period architecture and specialist shops			2
but residents say the messy yellow lines ruin the pretty @entity7 street @entity95 , head of @entity96 at @entity23 , has since been forced to apologise to the people of @entity7			1
he said : ' we know that @entity7 's cobbled streets are an important landmark for its residents and visitors alike			1
' we also want to protect its appearance by ensuring that parking restrictions are enforced in the area			0
' however , applying the usual methods of laying yellow lines with liquid paint is difficult on this tricky surface			0
' we used these lines as a trial to assess their durability here			0
' as it has n't worked , we 're already looking into alternative solutions and will get these in place as soon as we possibly can			0
' the @entity117 filmed @entity119 's @entity118 in the town , which was also the setting for scenes in another country , starring @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity7 's @entity126 was an important coaching inn in the 17th and 18th centuries and still enjoys huge popularity with visitors today			1
noted guests have included @entity132 , @entity133 , and sir @entity134 .			0
