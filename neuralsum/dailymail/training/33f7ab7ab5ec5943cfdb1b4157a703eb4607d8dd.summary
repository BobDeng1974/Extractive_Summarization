by @entity1 reporter published : 08:21 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 8 may 2013 the @entity2 has stripped 17 officers of their authority to control - and , if necessary , launch - nuclear missiles , due to their shockingly low proficiency in operating a missile launch simulator during a routine inspection			1
during a march inspection of the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 , the team earned the equivalent of a 'd ' grade when tested on its mastery of @entity18 missile launch operations in april , base officials quietly removed 17 officers , more than 10 per cent of the total force at @entity12 serving in the highly sensitive role of standing 24 - hour watch over the @entity2 's most powerful nuclear missiles , the intercontinental ballistic missiles that can strike targets across the globe			1
concern : the @entity2 stripped 17 officers of their authority to control a nuclear missiles , after their poor performance during an inspection ( officers simulate launching a @entity33 in 2009 at @entity12 ) the group 's deputy commander said it is suffering ' rot ' within its ranks			1
' we are , in fact , in a crisis right now , ' the commander , lt. col. @entity38 , wrote in an internal email obtained by @entity1 and confirmed by the @entity2			0
@entity38 is deputy commander of the @entity43 , whose three squadrons are responsible for manning the wing 's @entity46 launch control centers			1
the wing has 150 officers assigned to missile launch control duty			1
the @entity51 has an estimated 450 @entity18 missiles stored at missile silos around three bases - @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 in @entity58 and @entity12			2
the email describes a culture of indifference , with at least one intentional violation of missile safety rules and an apparent unwillingness among some to challenge or report those who violate rules			2
@entity38 also complained about unwarranted questioning of orders from superior officers by launch crews and failure to address superiors with the proper respect			1
security : the disciplined officers showed a lack of knowledge in operating a missile launch simulator and compromised the security of launch codes ( pictured in 2010 , airmen at @entity12 ) possible disciplinary action is pending against one other officer at @entity12 , who had purposefully broken a missile safety rule in an unspecified act that could have compromised the secret codes that enable the launching of missiles , which stand on high alert in underground silos in the nation 's midsection			1
officials said there was no compromise of missile safety or security			0
advising his troops on april 12 that they had ' fallen , ' @entity38 wrote that drastic corrective action was required because ' we did n't wake up ' after an underwhelming inspection in march			0
' now we 're discovering such rot in the crew force that your behavior while on alert is accepting of ' weapons safety rule violations , possible code compromises and other failings , ' all in the name of not inconveniencing yourselves , ' @entity38 wrote			0
' we are breaking you down , and we will build from the ground up , ' @entity38 added			0
@entity38 ' superiors , col. @entity116 , commander of the @entity11 , said inspectors rated officers proficiency in operating the missile launch simulator and responses to written questions about procedures			1
their performance was rated ' marginal , ' which @entity116 said is the equivalent of a 'd ' grade			0
' nobody is comfortable with that , ' @entity116 said			0
evaluation : inspectors rated the officers during an evaluation of the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 ( two commanders stand on the platform at a missile silo in @entity137 in nov. 1964 ) the trouble at @entity12 is the latest in a series of setbacks for the @entity2 's nuclear mission , highlighted by a 2008 @entity143 advisory group report that found a ' dramatic and unacceptable decline ' in the @entity2 's commitment to the mission , which has its origins in a @entity149 standoff with the @entity150			1
in 2008 , then - defense secretary @entity151 sacked the top civilian and military leaders of the @entity2 after a series of blunders , including the stunning mistake in a august 2007 incident in which an @entity2 b - 52 bomber flew from @entity12 to @entity158 , @entity159 , without the crew realizing it was armed with six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles			2
one outcome of the incident was the creation of @entity165 in january 2009 as a way of improving management of the nuclear enterprise			0
@entity169 , who served as an @entity171 launch control officer in the 1970s and is now a research scholar at @entity173 , said the @entity38 email points to a broader problem within the nuclear weapons force			2
' the nuclear air force is suffering from a deep malaise caused by the declining relevance of their mission since the @entity149 's end over 20 years ago , ' @entity169 said in an interview			0
' @entity18 launch crews have long been marginalized and demoralized by the fact that the @entity2 's culture and fast - track careers revolve around flying planes , not sitting in underground bunkers baby - sitting nuclear - armed missiles			2
' @entity169 is co-founder of @entity191 , an international group that advocates the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons .			0

officers at the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 earned a 'd ' grade during a march inspection
poor rating for compromising the security of missile launch codes and a lack of proficiency in operating the missile launch simulator
commanding officers *criticized* the culture of questioning authority and failing to show proper respect to superior officers
the squadrons operate the wing 's @entity46 launch control centers
@entity18 is a @entity217 nuclear , land - based intercontinental ballistic missile
