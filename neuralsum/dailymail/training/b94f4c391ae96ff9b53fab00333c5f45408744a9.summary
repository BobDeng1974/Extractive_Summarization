' you have to know in your heart when it ’s right			0
' when @entity14 's disappearance first made headlines after she failed to catch a flight home january 21 , 2013 , it appeared that the wife and mother , who married rather young , was simply sowing her oats late in life			1

@entity29 and @entity14 's brother @entity59 traveled to @entity28 and began a frantic search for @entity14 , not knowing she was likely already dead			1
@entity14 's face was so badly beaten that @entity29 had to identify her by the unusually high arch of her foot			1
but this month , @entity29 , a bus driver for the @entity64 , took a huge step towards leaving that horror behind			0
' i remember asking @entity25 , " are you ready for this ? " and she said immediately with no hesitation , " it would be an honor to raise the sons of my friend @entity14 , " ' @entity14 told the @entity40			1

' @entity14 was just great ... an absolute sweetheart , ' says @entity25 , whose own son , @entity106 , is just a little older than @entity14 's oldest boy @entity101 , 13			1
