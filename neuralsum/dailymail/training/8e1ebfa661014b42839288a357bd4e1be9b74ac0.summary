the couple sitting in the audience were clearly in the first flush of romance			1
watching them from a distance , there was an almost tangible frisson of possibility about them : the way he put an arm protectively around her back as he led her to her seat ; the way her smile twinkled as he leaned in to speak			2
even though i was singing on stage , i was unable to take my eyes off them			2
because not only had i brought them together in the first place , but that couple in the audience were my 80 - year - old grandmother @entity27 and her new ' special friend ' @entity28 , 75			1
@entity29 , a former seamstress , and @entity28 , an @entity31 teacher , met last year before one of my concerts			1
both had been widowed in recent years and become shadows of their former selves			2
second chance : @entity27 and @entity28 have become like happy - go - lucky teenagers since they met i feared for @entity29 's health			1
she 'd tried to commit suicide following the death of her husband of 60 years - my grandfather , @entity43 - and was frail , vulnerable and lonely			1
meanwhile , @entity28 was a ghost of a man			1
he 'd lost his wife @entity46 , 72 , in 2008 to a stroke after years of her suffering from dementia and was simply struggling to get on with life as best he could			1
neither of them ever expected to find happiness again and thought they were destined to become one of the 2.5 million elderly people in @entity55 who describe themselves as ' lonely '			1
then fate - and @entity56 - intervened			2
what greater gift can a granddaughter give to her loving @entity29 than helping her find love ? until @entity28 , i feared there 'd never be anyone else , because my grandparents were made for each other			1
@entity29 says she knew the minute she set eyes on my grandfather in 1950 that she would marry him			2
she was 15 , he was 19 , and both were hanging out with friends one afternoon in her home town of @entity69 when he made a kissing noise at her as she walked by			2
he was only there for a day trip , having travelled from his home in @entity74 , @entity75			2
they exchanged flirtatious banter , he followed her home that evening and her mother invited him in for tea			0
matchmaker : @entity82 is delighted her singing brought the couple together four years later , they married , moved to @entity75 and had my mum , @entity86 , in 1957 and her sister , @entity88 , in 1959			1
a decade or so later they moved to @entity90			0
like many women of that era , @entity29 was perfectly happy being the homemaker and would n't dream of letting @entity94 , an engineer , do any ironing , washing or cleaning			0
his dinner was always waiting on the table			0
the secret of their happy marriage boiled down to one thing - respect			0
and a kiss and a cuddle every day			0
it was in 2008 that we all noticed @entity94 was ill. he started refusing to walk into their lounge at home , and it was my mum who realised it was because he was hallucinating and thought there was no floor			0
@entity29 was desperate for him to remain the man he 'd always been , the one who would protect and care for her			0
it was n't until one night when he ' held her up at gunpoint ' using his walking stick and would n't let her leave the chair , that she accepted something was seriously wrong			0
@entity94 was rushed into hospital and diagnosed with dementia			0
distraught , she made the first of two attempts to take her life			1
when @entity94 died two weeks later in february 2010 , @entity29 was in such a terrible state and as frail as a little bird that , in my own mind , i said goodbye to her , too			1
' i went with @entity43 when he died , ' she 'd say			1
thankfully , she survived and , as a family , we were desperate for her to find peace and happiness again			1
first love : @entity27 was distraught when her husband , @entity43 , died in 2010 after suffering from dementia little did i know that in march 2012 events were beginning to conspire to lead her to just that			1
after watching me perform in @entity146 - i 'm a professional soprano and support artists such as @entity148 - a gentleman approached me in the street to say he had loved my singing			0
he introduced himself as @entity28 and bought some signed cds for his family and friends			1
i forgot all about him until a few months later when he sent me an email through my website saying he was going to watch me perform in @entity158			0
sadly , he got stuck in traffic , arriving only after the concert had finished , so i invited him to come for a drink with my mum and me			0
over coffee , @entity28 told me about @entity46 , his late wife , who 'd been a soprano , too			1
they 'd met while teaching in the same school - he also worked backstage at the local amateur operatic society where she sang - and married in 1974			2
they had two daughters , but @entity46 had died from a stroke in 2008 after battling dementia for 15 years			2
it left @entity28 , who 'd never missed one of her concerts , bereft			1
when the emotions consumed him , he 'd take himself off for drives and walks to try to lift his mood , but he says the first time he felt his spirits lift was when he heard me sing in @entity146			0
after that , @entity28 came to almost all of my shows in 2012			1
whenever i sang @entity185 from @entity186 , @entity28 would have to reach for a handkerchief to dry his tears			1
he later explained that when @entity46 had been very ill , she 'd sometimes suddenly sing that song , word and pitch - perfect			0
for those few minutes , he said , it was like having the old , lucid @entity46 back			0
@entity29 also came to many of those concerts as she 'd always been my biggest fan			2
one afternoon i introduced them after we bumped into @entity28 outside the concert hall and i invited him to join us for lunch			1
both fans of her work : @entity27 and @entity28 met at one of @entity82 's concerts they exchanged basic pleasantries , but i 'd never have pushed them further together for fear of putting pressure on them			1
although physically @entity28 looks nothing like @entity94 , lots of things reminded me of him			1
he 's calm and thoughtful , he listens intently during conversations and he 's practical			2
i remember watching once as @entity29 struggled to open a packet of sandwiches , only for @entity28 to produce a penknife from his pocket and cut the cellophane for her			1
over the coming months , as they bumped into one another at my performances , their initial pleasantries gave way to enthusiastic chatter			0
by spring last year , they 'd swapped phone numbers and would often call each other for a chat			0
they bonded over their traumatic experiences of caring for and losing their spouses			0
it was a year ago , in september last year , that they came to a concert together			0
this was when i spotted them together in the audience			0
@entity29 is adamant they were n't a couple at this stage			2
but she did n't need to be asked twice when @entity28 suggested he escort her ( ' i could n't believe what was happening to me ! ' she said )			1
two months later , my hopes of a romance were confirmed			0
when they arrived to watch me perform in @entity90 , @entity29 said to me : ' give me a hug			0
' then she turned to @entity28 and said the same			1
despite his blushes , they hugged and kissed cheeks , and @entity28 declared : ' that was nice			1
' ' well , if you feel it , go with it ! ' responded @entity29			0
since that glorious moment , they speak most days on the phone and see each other at least once a week			0
@entity29 has confided that they love to share a kiss			0
and why not ? they met when both of them were facing the emptiness of old age and widowhood stretching out before them			2
23 million @entity55 have a close friend or family member with dementia @entity29 lives in @entity266 and @entity28 in @entity267 , but they travel to see each other			1
they also make regular trips to @entity271 to stay with my husband and me			2
both families are thrilled they 've found one another ; for us , it 's wonderful to know @entity29 has someone as lovely as @entity28 to look out for her			1
she says she now has a reason to look forward rather than back			0
@entity29 's the typical doting female - she massages balm into @entity28 's legs as he suffers with cramps			1
she notices when he needs to straighten his collar and calls to him to go steady on the stairs			0
meanwhile , he prints off information about me from the internet and burns dvds of my performances from @entity290 as @entity29 does n't have a computer			0
in fact , they behave like happy - go - lucky teenagers			0
@entity29 tells me they 'll often giggle when sharing a nightcap in a hotel bar before bed - strictly separate rooms ! - realising that neither of their families know they 're on an impromptu adventure			0
@entity29 seems more content now she has someone to fuss over , and when @entity28 smiles , it reaches his eyes			1
it 's still early days but their time is now spent enjoying walks on the beach , fish - and - chip lunches by the sea and leisurely drives through the countryside			2
and , of course , they remain my most ardent fans			0
interview by @entity320 @entity322 's album @entity321 is now out			2
