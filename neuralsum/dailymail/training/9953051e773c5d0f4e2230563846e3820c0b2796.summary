by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:53 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 24 september 2013 for many mothers - to - be and bashful husbands , they have been a ritual of pregnancy for decades and regarded as a source of invaluable skills			1
but the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials			2
a drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being ' abandoned '			1
parenting charity @entity21 said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but @entity26 insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information			1
a hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons with ' virtual classes ' to be watched online			2
a drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision all of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at @entity26 showing its staff and labour rooms			1
the filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing , the early stages of labour , and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth			2
midwife @entity58 said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities			0
she said : ' it should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment			0
we have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately			0
' @entity26 said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby			1
the filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour			0
they will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief , breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance			0
but the parenting charity @entity21 has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being ' abandoned altogether '			0
@entity97 , chief executive , said : ' there is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses			0
' replacing the courses with an online - only system could put parents at a disadvantage			1
' antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information , but also the support you get from the parents that you meet			0
' @entity26 said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site , including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions .			1

a drop in women going to classes at @entity26 - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out
instead , the same information will be available online
but critics argue the move will put disadvantaged parents at risk and remove the *social* element of the classes
