by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 28 may 2013 most of us cursed the late spring			0
for @entity4 , however , it was a blessing			2
because it finally allowed her 252ft , 20 - year labour of love to bloom – in the most magnificent way			1
for 14 years , the amateur gardener carefully trained this wisteria to grow along the full length of her wall			1
then , for another six years , she waited			0
each spring it tried to bloom , and each spring the flowers were killed off by frost			2
impressive : for 15 years @entity4 , 56 , lovingly trained the vine to grow along the full length of her giant garden wall near @entity20 in @entity21 before : despite having no gardening training , in 1993 she embarked on the task of trying to get the wisteria to spread across the wall ( pictured in 1988 ) different scene : when mrs @entity4 and her husband moved into their home , @entity32 , the only thing growing on the wall was ivy until this year , when the delayed spring meant that , for the first time , the whole bush bloomed into a 13ft - high waterfall of mauve			1
mrs @entity4 , 56 , started tending the wisteria in 1993 , to replace the ivy that she and her husband had found growing on the wall when they moved into @entity32 near @entity20 , @entity21			1
‘ there was a very neglected wisteria growing on the other side of the wall , ’ she said			2
‘ i began pruning it and training it to grow on this side of the wall			0
‘ i did n’t know what i was doing , i just read from books what to do			0
‘ year on year it got bigger and bigger			0
it grew ten feet a year in each direction before reaching both ends of the wall six years ago			1
outstanding : thanks to the late spring the mauve - coloured @entity59 wisteria senensis is covered in flowers across its full length and 13ft height big job : mrs @entity4 spends two whole weeks a year pruning the bush in february and july and replacing 1,000 ties that keep it attached to a wire structure on the wall happy : mrs @entity4 , who has four other wisterias , including one which is 100ft long , is a member of the @entity72 and opens her garden to visitors ‘ it ’s been filling out ever since but the flowers keep being killed off by the spring frosts			1
last year only about 10 per cent of the flowers bloomed			0
’ mrs @entity4 spends two weeks a year pruning the plant , thought to be one of the longest wisteria in @entity82 , and replacing the 1,000 ties which keep it attached to the wall			1
she opens her gardens to the public every friday to raise money for the local hospice			0
mrs @entity4 hopes her beloved plant will stay in bloom for at least another fortnight , as long as the weather stays cool			2
she said : ‘ when i walk along and see it , it brings a lump to my throat and i stand there with tears in my eyes			0

but she *'s* had to endure further six - year wait for the bush to burst into full bloom near @entity20 , @entity21
mauve - coloured @entity59 wisteria *sinensis* is covered in flowers across its full length and 13ft height
