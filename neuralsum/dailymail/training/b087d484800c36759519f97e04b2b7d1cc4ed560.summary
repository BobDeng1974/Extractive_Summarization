over the past week , i have been awed and inspired by @entity2 's heroes : the first responders who risked their lives at a moment 's notice ; the educators whose devotion to their students shone brightest in one of our nation 's darkest hours ; the children who comforted each other despite their fear ; the families coming together to support each other as they grieve			1

and i want you to know that this is just the beginning			2
as my husband has said , in the coming weeks , he will use all the powers of his office to engage citizens from across this country to find ways to prevent tragedies like this one			0
