the highly - publicized corruption case against former virginia governor @entity1 and his wife has torn their family part , as evidenced by a recent letter written by their oldest child			1
in september , the @entity8 were both found guilty of taking bribes to promote a vitamin company and currently face up to 30 years in prison for their crimes			1
but daughter @entity14 believes her mother @entity15 is mostly responsible , and is one of more than 400 people who have written letters asking for lenient sentence for her father - who was once on the short list to be @entity24 's vice presidential candidate			1
@entity26 's girl : @entity14 ( left ) has written a letter to the court , asking for a lenient sentence for her father , former virginia governor @entity1 ( center ) , who was found guilty in september on corruption charges			1
pictured above walking him into court with brother @entity35 ( right ) @entity37 's fault : in the letter , @entity14 puts most of the blame on her mother @entity15 ( pictured ) who she believes may be mentally ill ' my mom ... has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees [ sic ] , ' @entity14 wrote in a letter to the court			0
' she hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she did nâ€™t communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve			0
... the testimony about my mom ... unfortunately , was the reality			0
' @entity14 added that she believes her mother suffers from mental illness , and that her father planned to address her health after leaving office last january			0
he never got the chance , since both were indicted just days after he stepped down			0
the governor 's eldest daughter is just one of 440 people who wrote letters asking for a lower sentence for @entity1 including hose majority leader @entity67 , senator @entity68 of @entity69 and evangelist @entity70			1
@entity1 's lawyers asked a judge tuesday to order three years of community service for his federal corruption convictions while prosecutors recommended a prison term of at least 10 years			1
@entity1 will be sentenced january 6 for promoting a dietary supplement in exchange for more than $ 165,000 in gifts and loans			1
his wife , @entity15 , also was convicted and will be sentenced febuary 20			0
during the trial , @entity1 said he was innocent and that his wife took the brides behind his back , when they grew estranged			2
' this offense is a total aberration in what was by all accounts a successful and honorable career , ' @entity1 's lawyers wrote			1
' moreover , the conduct that led to this conviction is far outside the ' heartland ' of public corruption cases			0
no public official has ever before been convicted of federal or state corruption charges on the basis of similar conduct			1
' the attorneys said a sentence of ' 6,000 hours of full - time , rigorous , unpaid community service at a remote location served over three years ' would be appropriate			1
that amount of hours would be about three years of working 40 - hour weeks			0
prosecutors argued @entity1 's offense ' was neither isolated nor the product of a single criminal choice			2
rather , the defendant has been convicted of a bribery conspiracy that lasted nearly two full years , and the defendant repeatedly made conscious decisions to continue that conspiracy time and again			0
' promoters : the @entity115 were indicted a year ago on charges of taking more than $ 165,000 in cash and gifts to promote @entity120 ' vitamin company			0
@entity120 pictured above with @entity121 up in the air : @entity1 will be sentenced on january 6 , while his wife will be sentenced on february 20			1
both face up to 30 years in jail going for a spin : @entity120 told prosecutors that he lent the @entity8 his @entity128 , among other favors @entity130 ceo @entity120 testified under immunity that he spent freely on the mcdonnells in order to secure their help promoting his supposed cure - all , the tobacco - derived anti-inflammatory @entity136			1
among the gifts were : nearly $ 20,000 in designer clothing and accessories for @entity121 a $ 6,500 @entity142 watch for her husband $ 15,000 in catering for one of their daughter 's wedding free vacations free golf outings free spins in @entity120 ' @entity128 @entity120 also provided three loans totaling $ 120,000 @entity1 's attorneys provided a detailed account of his life and career sprinkled with laudatory quotes from many of the hundreds of friends and associates who wrote letters urging leniency			1
the government asked @entity165 district judge @entity164 to impose a sentence within a guideline range of just over 10 years to a little less than 13 years			2
that range was calculated by the @entity165 @entity169 based on a number of factors , including @entity1 's background and the seriousness of the offense			2
it includes an obstruction of justice enhancement based on what prosecutors say are lies in @entity1 's testimony			2
@entity1 's lawyers are challenging the guideline calculations , arguing that the range should be 33 months to 41 months			1
they wrote that a prison term of any length , ' much less one of ten years or more , ' would be too harsh			2
judges usually issue a sentence within the guideline range , but they are not bound by it			0
supporters : @entity193 majority leader @entity67 ( left ) , @entity69 senator @entity68 ( center ) , and evangelist @entity70 ( right ) were three of the 440 people who wrote letters asking for a lenient sentence for @entity1 @entity197 , a professor at the @entity198 and a former federal prosecutor , said @entity1 is looking at many years in prison			1
' the judge would have to have a pretty good explanation why the former governor is getting such favorable treatment , ' @entity197 said			0
defense lawyers said several charitable and religious organizations have offered a volunteer position to @entity1			2
they specifically mentioned two : @entity208 and the @entity209 of @entity210			0
@entity208 offered @entity1 jobs heading its hunger relief program in @entity213 or working at its orphanage and fish farm in @entity216			0
' as with his volunteering during @entity219 , @entity1 has shown an authentic willingness to serve others no matter how difficult the task , ' group president @entity217 said in a statement			0
@entity224 - based @entity208 was founded by religious broadcaster @entity70			0
@entity1 is a graduate of @entity70 's @entity226 law school			0
@entity70 is one of 440 people who wrote letters supporting @entity1 and filed with the court as an appendix to the sentencing brief			1
the @entity209 offered to make @entity1 its regional coordinator in southwest @entity69 , where he would coordinate prison ministry workshops and migrant worker outreach , defense attorneys said .			2
